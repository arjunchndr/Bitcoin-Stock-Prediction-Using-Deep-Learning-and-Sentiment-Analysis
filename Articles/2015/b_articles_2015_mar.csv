03/01/2015,"['Australian Adam Tepper founded the Independent Reserve Bitcoin exchange in June, 2013, and launched it last October. One of the unique features of Independent Reserve was its ties to “Australia’s highly regulated financial sector” and its annual auditing by PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the four biggest auditors in the world.\n\nYesterday, the former IT manager was on vacation in one of Australia’s favorite destinations, Thailand, when he was killed in a motorcycle accident. Local news characterized the death in Phuket City as preventable and potentially alcohol-related. From the Phuket Wan:\n\nThe rider appeared to be heading towards Chalong Circle. […] Police believe he had been drinking. The hired motorcycle continued on and finished scores of metres from the body.\n\nThe exchange was apparently aware of the incident, tweeting “RIP Adam, we will miss you more than you could imagine” and embedding the following video.\n\nAn IT Veteran\n\nTepper’s first venture was Asia-Australia Technology, a company which serviced companies by writing proprietary software solutions and, in the case of their largest client, Sydney’s Nine Entertainment, notably developing their broadcast management platform.\n\nWhat Will Become of the Exchange?\n\nAccording to a news item posted to the site by Chief Technology Officer Adrian Przelozny, “All Independent Reserve functions will continue to operate without disruption.” The company has five other corporate officers and one advisor, financial industry veteran Michael Go. It is unclear at this time who will take over the functions of the Chief Executive, but it appears the company is prepared to continue without his contributions.\n\nDied Doing What He Enjoyed\n\nMr. Tepper’s biography specifies that riding a motorcycle is exactly the sort of thing he loved to do in his free-time.\n\nAdam is a keen motorsport enthusiast and an annual participant in the Finke Desert Race. Adam thoroughly enjoys the great outdoors including off-roading, camping, trail riding and sailing.\n\nPost-Humous Publication\n\nAnother news item on the Independent Reserve’s website says that he was working on a book when he passed away and that it may soon see publication.\n\nWe will honour his legacy by completing the book and ensuring it is published in a fitting manner. The Bitcoin Association of Australia has kindly offered to collect Bitcoin donations that will be used to fund publishing costs of the book.\n\nThe donation page for this effort is located here.\n\nIt is sad when anyone dies unexpectedly, but it is particularly disruptive when such a person is contributing to a developmental revolution such as Bitcoin. The launch of Independent Reserve was treated as rather big news, especially given its ties to the traditional finance industry, by the local media which still, as late as October of last year, had little to no understanding of how Bitcoin works.\n\nCCN will keep you posted with any pressing details that come about in this story.\n\nImage of Adam Tepper copyright Independent Reserve of Sydney, Australia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust is poised to become the first publicly traded bitcoin fund, with approval and assignment of a ticker symbol by the financial industry’s main self-regulatory body paving the way for trading on an electronic platform operated by OTC Markets Group.\n\nThe BIT, which was first launched in 2013 as a private fund for accredited investors with annual incomes greater than $200,000 or assets of more than $1 million, has been racing against a rival offering by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss,...', 'New Bitcoin ATMs in the USA and the UK, youth entrepreneurial program looking to empower under-served populations with Bitcoin, MGT Capital Investments to merge with Tera Group and launch the first publicly traded American Bitcoin derivatives exchange, and more top news to wrap up the week.\n\nMGT Capital Investments to Merge with Tera Group\n\nMGT Capital Investments announced on February 26, it has enter into a Letter of Intent with Tera Group, Inc., the owner of TeraExchange, LLC, a Swap Execution Facility regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nBoth companies are looking to come to a definitive agreement by March 16, 2016, that would lead the first regulated Bitcoin derivatives platform to go public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) MKT.\n\nH.

If you go to the large B2B Cannabis shows, you’ll be amazed by the technology there, from the technology developed outside cannabis that’s now being applied to the space, as well as what’s been developed inside the industry. [...] I got involved in the Internet in 1993 with the dream of a microcredit-based bank allowing people to pay for content as opposed to ads. I still think there is room for that. And with more and more professors teaching about bitcoin and distributed or decentralized banking, I believe bitcoin is not going away. But there would have to be a reason for major uptake for me to really call it disruptive.

[...] Our half year has seen significant growth in our liquidity desk and digitalX Direct operations, as well as investments made in our early mover position in digital currencies.""\n\nNew Bitcoin ATMs in the US and the UK\n\nIn light of CoinTelegraph\'s partnership with Coin ATM Radar, we are taking a look at the newest Bitcoin ATMs that went live this past week.\n\nAccording to Coin ATM Radar\'s data, there are currently 355 active Bitcoin ATMs around the world.\n\nThe latest additions to the list include three Bitcoin ATMs in the USA, and one Bitcoin ATM in Bristol, UK.\n\nOn February 16, the city of Bristol in the UK, welcomed its second Bitcoin ATM, a one-way Lamassu device, operated by SatoshiPoint. The machine is located at local grocery story the Best Supermarket, 82 Stokes Croft, and is available 24/7.\n\nOn February 20, the United Stated welcomed two new Genesis Coin Bitcoin ATMs in Chicago, both operated by Red Leaf Chicago.\n\nThe first Genesis Coin device is a one-way ""Satoshi1"" Bitcoin ATM machine, located at Atlas Brewing Company, 2747 N Lincoln Ave.\n\nThe second Genesis Coin device is a ""Genesis1"" two-way Bitcoin ATM machine, located at bowling and billiard hall Seven Ten Lanes, 1055 E 55th St.\n\nOn February 22, another Bitcoin ATM went live, this time in Milwaukee at Cents Gifts, 901 E Center St. The machine is available Monday to Saturday from 11am to 9pm, and Sunday from 12pm to 6pm, and requires a government issued ID.\n\nMarket Activity\n\nBitcoin\'s price against the US dollar seems to have entered a rather strong bullish wave, taking the price up to US$254 on Saturday, February 28, as of Blockchain.info\'s data.\n\nIt seems as if the BTC/USD price has broke out of the bearish trend that was controlling the market over the past weeks, in favor of a new bullish trend.\n\nThe number of Bitcoin transactions per day remains stable, while conserving its typical weekly trend.\n\nAs usual, weekdays remain the favorite moment for bitcoiners to trade, while weekends are the generally slow periods.\n\nNotably, the number of transactions reached its peek on Tuesday, February 24, with a weekly climax at more than 104,000 transactions, according to Blockchain.info\'s data. Sunday, March 1, was the lowest day when it comes to Bitcoin transactions with a little more than 87,000 transactions.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Most resort to metaphors or diagrams. At a basic level, the block chain is a searchable ledger where all transactions are confirmed, in a matter of minutes, by a network of computers working to perform complex algorithms. Each part of the network maintains a copy of the ledger. About six times an hour, a new group of accepted transactions — a block — is created, added to the chain and broadcast to the other parts of the network. In this manner, all transactions are recorded and linked and thus can be traced. It is nearly impossible to modify past blocks in the chain.\n\nBy simply downloading the Bitcoin software, anyone can gain access to the block chain, search it and submit transactions to the network.\n\nEntrepreneurs worldwide are now working to harness that technology for use beyond Bitcoin transactions. The block chain, they say, could ultimately upend not only the traditional financial system but also the way people transfer and record financial assets like stocks, contracts, property titles, patents and marriage licenses — essentially anything that requires a trusted middleman for verification.\n\n“There’s a race going on to extend the block chain’s capabilities,” said Adam Ludwin, a co-founder of Chain.com, a start-up that seeks to help developers build Bitcoin applications.\n\nOn web forums and at Bitcoin conferences, talk is shifting to the next generation of applications built on block-chain technology. So-called Bitcoin 2.0 projects dominated the conversation at the Satoshi Roundtable, a retreat for Bitcoin enthusiasts at a resort in the Dominican Republic in February, according to accounts from some participants. About 20 percent of Chain’s roughly 5,000 users are developing nonfinancial block-chain applications, compared with less than 10 percent a year ago, Mr. Ludwin said. Banks and multinational telecommunications companies are quietly expressing interest in ways to take advantage of the block chain.\n\nInvestors are also starting to bet on the technology. Through the end of February, Bitcoin companies had raised $550 million in venture capital, according to Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm. And although much of that financing has been directed to trading platforms, exchanges and digital-wallet start-ups — $106 million alone has gone to Coinbase, a popular provider of Bitcoin wallets — companies working on block-chain applications are beginning to secure chunks of financing.\n\nFor instance, Blockstream — which is looking to extend the block chain’s capabilities — announced it had raised $21 million in November. Ripple Labs, which oversees an online payment system called Ripple, has raised $9 million and is finalizing another round of financing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong the venture capital firms that have backed Bitcoin-related companies is Khosla Ventures, an investor in Blockstream and Chain. Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla, said the firm’s investments were based on the conviction that the block chain would alter the way society thought about transactions — financial or otherwise.\n\n“Anytime there’s a broker — anytime there’s an expert attesting to the validity of something — all of that could be obviated by the block chain,” Mr. Rabois said. “It’s not a guaranteed success, but the upside is so large that as a venture investor, it’s an extremely attractive investment opportunity.”\n\nVideo\n\nSeveral start-ups are developing ways to transfer traditional money using the block chain in the hopes of streamlining financial transactions. One such company, Coins.ph, based in the Philippines, has seized on the block chain’s peer-to-peer technology as a way to improve the remittance business and global payments by lowering costs and speeding up transactions. The company’s goal is for people to use its services without having to understand the block chain, much as people send email without thinking about the Internet.\n\n“The way I think of the block chain is a really modern infrastructure to move money around the globe,” said Marwan Forzley, the chief executive of Align Commerce, another start-up seeking to make cross-border payments easier.\n\nAlthough companies focused on financial applications for the block chain far outnumber those experimenting with other uses, the gap is narrowing. For example, a start-up called BlockSign verifies signed documents on the block chain. Another company, Filecoin, is aiming to build a marketplace for storing data on the block chain.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nPeerNova — which said it was planning to announce financing that would bring its total to about $20 million — is developing a technology that will use the block chain to prove the authenticity of a document, like a patent. The company is also toying with registry applications for other records, including title deeds and financial data.\n\n“Our entire system of contracts is based on a trusted third party,” said Naveed Sherwani, the chief executive of PeerNova. But with the block chain, he added, “there is no third party anymore.”\n\nWith the rise of the block chain has come a fundamental question: Should technology replace human discretion? Some experts, even those who study cryptocurrency, are skeptical.\n\n“There are very good reasons why we have legal and social institutions and economic intermediaries,” said Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton who studies block-chain technology.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his teaching, Professor Narayanan said he often used car ownership as an example. In theory, block-chain technology could eliminate the need for, among other inconveniences, title certificates and dealers to ensure the secure transfer of money and property. The idea initially sounds appealing, but if the car is broken into or stolen, he said, the block chain alone will not be able to resolve the dispute.\n\n“It’s not just one human you’re getting rid of, but the entire economic, legal and social structure that reinforces the idea of property,” he said.\n\nThere is also still broad support for Bitcoin. Many investors and entrepreneurs maintain that Bitcoin will outgrow its early role as a speculative investment and become a viable alternative currency for international payments. Others see countries turning to Bitcoin when their own currency is unstable.\n\nThe virtual currency must also maintain some value for the network to work. Bitcoin miners, the computers that drive the block chain, win Bitcoins if they successfully solve complex cryptographic problems. If Bitcoin’s value continues to drop, it could become too expensive to keep the computers running.\n\nBut there are also those wary of moving too fast. Though enthusiastic about the block chain’s potential, a group of Bitcoin supporters, many of them early adopters, wants start-ups to focus first on strengthening existing Bitcoin applications, like digital wallets and trading platforms, before developing other uses for the underlying technology.\n\nExchanges, where traders can meet to buy and sell Bitcoins for dollars, euros and other currencies, have been especially vulnerable. Anxiety from the collapse last year of Mt. Gox, a prominent exchange based in Japan, is still high. And a security breach in January at Bitstamp, another exchange, sent further ripples of doubt through the Bitcoin industry.\n\n“People are rightfully talking about the block chain,” said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that has invested in a number of Bitcoin start-ups, including Blockchain, a digital-wallet provider and software developer, and BTCChina, a Chinese exchange. “The question is how do you realize the first opportunity here?”\n\n“You can’t jump to the top of the stairs,” he added. “Everything is a process.”"", 'In the beginning, there was Fiat, and Fiat was government. Through fiat, all things are priced. Dollars, it turns out, are blasphemy.\n\n“Just get Congress to pass a bill authorizing the printing of full legal tender treasury notes . . . and pay your soldiers with them and go ahead and win your war with them also.”\n\nAll government law is fiat. Fiat is a decree. When used for currency, it is a recognition of the value of paper and ink by law. Governments officially recognize a sovereign currency as legal tender and accept payments of debt only in that currency. Fiat also gives the government the power to decide how much debt you owe. Historically, this has worked great for government and its ability to fund wars – at great cost to its people.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to coin money and regulate its value. The United States government recognizes the Dollar as its official currency. In return for a deal struck in 1907, that control of the Dollar passed to a private bank. Since then, the buying power of the Dollar has plummeted 97%.\n\nDollars are not the first currency used in the United States. Fiat currency has bloody roots on U.S. soil older than the country itself.\n\nMassachusetts Invades Canada, Eh\n\nIn 1690, New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut sent military expeditions into Canada. Starting with Port Royal, 800 men led by Sir William Phips were to loot and pillage through Quebec and Montreal.\n\nAlso Read: Bank of Canada Looking Into Issuing Digital Currency Like Bitcoin\n\nPort Royal was defended by 70 soldiers. Its fortifications were unfinished, and canons were not in place. When Phip’s force landed, over half the Port Royal soldiers were absent. There was no resistance, the governor of Port Royal surrendered.\n\nAlthough Phip’s made a verbal agreement to leave private citizens, their property, and religious worship alone, his honor was short-lived. His men looted the town, destroyed livestock, desecrated the local church and Phip’s personally ordered the peasantry to swear and oath to William and Mary of England before establishing a new government.\n\nMassachusetts printed £7,000 to finance Phips, establishing the first fiat currency by declaring 5% markup when using it to pay debts to the state. The colony pegged the value of the currency to a silver Spanish coin – Reales, referred by the colonists as Dollars.\n\nThe success of the Massachusetts’ currency was short-lived. The loot recovered by Phips from Port Royal would only last so long. Later that year, two thousand more Massachusett’s troops were to invade Quebec. Delays and harsh weather caused the invasion to fail, miserably. Without any plunder, there was no way to pay the troops. Massachusetts began printing more.\n\nPaper currency in Massachusetts suffered horrible inflation. In 1690, a Spanish Reale was worth 6 Massachusetts shillings. By 1742, a Reale was worth 924 shillings. The printing never stopped, currency reboots occurred multiple times. After a bailout from the Bank of England had failed to rescue the currency, British Parliament restricted the use of paper money in Massachusetts.\n\nMassachusetts issued no currency until 1775 when Paul Revere issued Soldier’s Notes, and later Continentals, to fund soldiers for the Battle of Bunker Hill.\n\nNot Worth a Continental\n\nFollowing the example set by Massachusetts, in 1775 the early US federal government issued its currency, too. Continental currency or Continentals, funded the American Revolution. By 1850, over $240,000,000 had been issued. A Continental held 1/40th its original value. One year later they ceased circulating as a currency, becoming effectively worthless.\n\nBenjamin Franklin wrote an essay, “Of the Paper Money of America,” arguing the issuance and inflation of Continentals had effectively been a tax on Americans. With similar sentiment, the Quakers in Pennsylvania banned Continentals, citing their passivism did not permit them to pay war taxes.\n\nAlso Read: Cost of Paper Money: $200 Billion, Time to Phase Out and Introduce Bitcoin?\n\nInflation of colonial currency was notorious; Adam Smith calls it out specifically in “Wealth of Nations.”\n\n“The paper currencies of North America consisted, not in bank notes payable to the bearer on demand, but in government paper… and though the colony governments paid no interest to the holders of this paper”. “The government of Pennsylvania, indeed, pretended, upon their first emission of paper money, in 1722, to render their paper of equal value with gold and silver by enacting penalties against all those who made any difference in the price of their goods when they sold them for a colony paper, and when they sold them for gold and silver; a regulation equally tyrannical, but much less effectual than that which it was meant to support.”\n\nThanks, Pennsylvania. All you had to do was stay off a list.\n\nDollars Ain’t ‘Murican, Amigo\n\nIn 1792, Alexander Hamilton commissioned a report into the amount of silver in a Spanish Reale. Congress defined the U.S. Dollar by this amount, about 24 grams of silver. The value of the Dollar was defined by Spanish currency.\n\nUntil the Civil War, private currency was issued in the United States. This form of paper money was redeemable for gold and silver specie, or coinage. The value of the paper money rests on the ability of the issuing organization to exchange it for specie (coinage) – a system of trust.\n\nAbraham Lincoln changed that and nationalized the banking system. In the first months of the Civil War, Lincoln spent the entirety of the government’s tariff and excise income. He borrowed every available dollar from New York banks. It was not until the interest rates of British banks, 24%, so appalled Lincoln that he called for other solutions.\n\nIn 1861, Congress issued $50,000,000 in Demand Notes. The ink used to print the currency was green. Thus, they became known as ‘Greenbacks.’ They were not legal tender but were fully redeemable for gold. As Demand Notes were used to pay taxes, they were taken out of circulation.\n\nBy 1862, Lincoln realized Demand Notes would not be enough to fund the war effort. Illinois coal tycoon and politician Dick Taylor suggested Lincoln issue paper currency backed by nothing.\n\n“Just get Congress to pass a bill authorizing the printing of full legal tender treasury notes . . . and pay your soldiers with them and go ahead and win your war with them also. If you make them full legal tender… they will have the full sanction of the government and be just as good as any money; as Congress is given that express right by the Constitution.”\n\nUnited States Notes were issued, backed solely by government Fiat. They resembled Demand Notes, as they were also printed using green ink. At first, they were recognized at a similar value to the gold-backed Demand Notes.\n\nBy 1863, the Fiat Greenbacks lost one-third their value compared to gold-backed Greenbacks. Their value waxed and waned with the North’s victories and losses in the war. The lowest point for the Fiat notes came in July of 1864; their value reaching 40% of the Demand Notes. Even after the North’s victory, their value only ever reaching two-thirds that of the Demand Note.\n\nCounterfeiting Inflates the Currency\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Great Britain ran a counterfeiting operation for American Continentals. Agents that worked for the British government known as “shovers” put as much counterfeit U.S. currency into circulation as they could. The punishment for these American Loyalists shoving counterfeit currency into circulation was hanging.\n\nThe use of counterfeit currency in warfare is ancient. The idea relies on increasing the supply of the currency, inflating it, to the point where the opponent can no longer fund their military. Great Britain understood this tactic and their employment was hugely successful. After the Revolutionary War, it’s estimated one-third to one-half of Continentals were forgeries.\n\nAlso Read: Congressional Report on Bitcoin: to be considered a possible competitor to U.S. official currency\n\nEven the early Massachusetts governments recognized that it wasn’t hard for the common man to print copies resembling the official government paper. Each of their official papers matched a stub held by the Treasury – similar to a 50/50 gambling ticket or movie stub.\n\nQuantitative Easin g, Stimulus , Bail Outs , Counterfeiting was a common, lucrative, crime. Ask any politician or banker.\n\nIn 1851, a barrel maker scavenging for materials uncovered a counterfeiting operation outside of Chicago. Upon alerting the local sheriff, he was deputized and successfully tracked and arrested the entire band of counterfeiters. The barrel maker, Allan Pinkerton, became the first detective for the city of Chicago as reward for his part in their apprehension.\n\nDuring the 1940’s, Allan’s brother Robert formed a successful private security firm. “Pinkerton & Co” provided the majority of security for railroads and stagecoaches financed by Wells Fargo bank. Allan eventually left Chicago, joining his brother. Together, they formed Pinkerton National Detective Agency.\n\nThe new agency specialized in private and military contracts, hunting down counterfeiters and train robbers. Eventually, they expanded their services to protecting the U.S. President after uncovering a plot to assassinate Lincoln. The Pinkertons served as the model for what is currently called the U.S. Secret Service.\n\nLegal Tender For All (Military) Debts\n\nWoodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 and established the Federal Reserve as the national bank of the United States. The Federal Reserve Note, known today as Dollars, became official U.S. tender. A year later, World War One began.\n\nThe young Federal Reserve issued bonds to fund American efforts from 1917 to 1918. Over $17 billion in bonds were issued, and government waved taxation on up to $30,000 of the interest. Effectively, the Federal Reserve promised to print future currency, in exchange for funding the military industrial complex today.\n\nBy 1920, the purchasing power of the Dollar fell 50%. It would recover slightly, to 80%, just before the arrival of the second World War then begins a slow, long, downward decent that accompanies military occupations and imperialism as a foreign policy to where we are today – 3%.\n\nDollar Adoption is a Forced Ponzi Scheme\n\nJust like New England, the contemporary US monetary policy is a gamble. $8 Trillion worth of federal programs relies on renewing one-year loans with foreign governments.\n\nThe U.S. can take those loans because the power to print money is the power to siphon the value from every person, business and government storing their wealth in dollars. Ultimately, it can just create that much currency as a last resort.\n\nAlthough government fiat may restrict or affect a market, it does not have the power to change the law of Supply and Demand. By officially recognizing a currency and enforcing its use a government restricts competition and steers demand toward the chosen currency. Through the creation and destruction of the currency in circulation, it affects the supply.\n\nIf someone saves their entire lives for retirement, they are storing the value they could have spent now to make their life easier in the future. When they store their life savings in a currency, they are placing trust in the people who maintain it. If the Federal Reserve inflates the Dollar to the point where one million dollars buys a candy bar, why bother saving for retirement? In an inflationary system, you’re better off spending the currency as soon as you receive it to maximize the purchasing power. Investments are just a gamble, trusting the investments to outpace inflation.\n\nThe price of a bitcoin in dollars may skyrocket, but not because of anything in Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s price in dollars will skyrocket because Dollar adoption will decline. As the rest of the world abandons a failing currency, they’ll likely turn to other fiat currencies. That won’t change their circumstance. Fiat will still inflate until it collapses. But it will be another step in a decentralized direction.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin to Come is 1 XBT to 1 XBT. Deflationary cryptocurrency is an option, and it peacefully coexists with its inflationary counterpart. With Bitcoin, no central authority can inflate the supply and force the holders to fund a war. One bitcoin will be the same amount of the total supply of bitcoins today as it will be in 100 years. If not Bitcoin, then something else – perhaps whatever the AI robot overlords decide.\n\nFiat currency is a spectacular tool for elites to steer the economy and fund war. Bitcoin allows you to withdraw from imperialism without moving across political borders.\n\nSources: Celebrate Boston, Coins, Web of Debt.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'BitFury has completed manufacturing their new 28nm Bitcoin ASIC miner chip. This a big step from their current 55nm chip. BitFury had a great 2014 bringing in $40 million in venture capital funding.

At stake: the legal status of bitcoin.\n\nThe Dutch bitcoin community is in a state of disarray. Over the past couple of months, two of the three board members of the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation have stepped down as an indirect result of communal discord. Simultaneously, one of the biggest bitcoin related companies operating in the area has antagonized a significant portion of Dutch bitcoin users. Some believe the very future of cryptographic currencies in this European bitcoin hub might be determined by a court appeal in the next couple of months, and the desired outcome has split Dutch bitcoiners into two camps.\n\nThe Court Case\n\nAt the heart of this story is a court case which deals with events that occurred almost three years ago. In August of 2012, a user bought 2,750 bitcoins worth €8.05 each for a grand total of €22,137.50 from another user – both of whose identities are not known. The buyer paid up his part of the deal soon after this deal was agreed upon. The seller, however, did not send all 2,750 bitcoins, but instead transferred only 990 of them.\n\nAfter having urged the seller to transfer the rest of the funds several times in the weeks that followed, this proved to be to no avail: the remaining 1,760 bitcoins were never sent. The buyer therefore disbanded the remainder of the deal two months later, in October of 2012. He then asked the seller to reimburse him with the rest of the money that he had paid him instead, which added up to €14,168. But once again, the seller ignored all attempts to close the deal.\n\nAs a result, the buyer saw no other option than to take the case to court. The seller was summoned almost a year after the original trade should have taken place, in June of 2013. But by now, of course, the bitcoin exchange rate had skyrocketed to almost €70, a rise of more than 800%. Consequently – and this is the core of the controversy – the buyer did not only demand to be paid back the €14,168 that was defrauded from him, but also wanted the profit he would have made if he had gotten all of the bitcoins within a reasonable time. On top of the original €14,168, he asked for an additional compensation of a whopping €132,792.\n\nAs it turns out, the legitimacy of the claim might in part depend on the legal status of bitcoin. According to civil law in the Netherlands, if the seller is indebted to the buyer in something that is regarded as money, then the seller will have to cough up the exact amount of money in whichever currency the debt is stated. So if bitcoin is money legally regarded as a currency, as the buyer claims, he has a right to 1,760 bitcoins, or the equivalent in euros (€132,792 currently).\n\nThe judge however, disagreed. Not only was the debt not stated in bitcoin anymore, as the deal was officially canceled in October of 2012, but — more importantly for this story — he also decided that bitcoin is not money under Dutch civil law. The judge did, however, rule that the rise in exchange rate up until the official cancellation of the deal in October of 2012 should be included in the reimbursement. This was one euro per bitcoin, hence adding €1,760 to the original amount of €14,168 for a total of €15,928. The claim to an additional €132,792 was denied.\n\nThe Appeal\n\nWhen the news of the court case first broke, the majority of the Dutch bitcoin community didn't make a big fuss of it. Apart from a couple of articles in – mainly tech and bitcoin related media outlets, the trial as well as the verdict didn't seem to have had much of an impact one way or the other, at least on the surface.\n\nBut this changed in September of 2014. On September 3, at the monthly Bitcoin Wednesday meetup in Amsterdam, the Dutch bitcoin brokerage Bitonic supported by the buyer, his law firm Solv, and the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation (which included Bitonic CEO Jouke Hofman as one of three board members) announced a plan to appeal the verdict. They wanted to take the case to a higher court in order to prove for once and for all that bitcoin is in fact money, and should be regarded as such under civil law.\n\nIn a statement, Hofman said:\n\n“We believe that the decision is based on an incorrect interpretation of the law. Because of this, we feel that the resulting classification of bitcoin may not last. We experience the resulting uncertainty as a restraining force not only in the progress of our business, but also in our contacts with, for example, customers, business partners and governments. Furthermore, as a secondary reason, we feel that bitcoin can benefit from a classification as money.”\n\nIn order to take the case to a higher court, money was needed to cover Solv's expenses, as well as the appeal itself. Therefore, Bitonic launched the “Bitcoin is Money” (“Bitcoin is Geld”) initiative and corresponding website, which included a crowdfunding campaign. €5,000 was paid up front by Bitonic themselves, while they hoped to collect another €10,000 from the Dutch bitcoin community. With the help from two major partners, mining specialist ButAds and Lighthouse funder Olivier Janssens, and dozens of individual contributions, the goal was reached within a week.\n\nThe Discord\n\nNot everyone was happy about the initiative, however. Even during the very first public announcement of the “Bitcoin is Money” project at the Bitcoin Wednesday meetup, some of the attendees vocally objected to the plan, which was met with an expressive round of applause from a segment of the audience. And during the month that followed, these objections grew wider and louder with the emergence of a series of debates on message boards, podcasts, op-eds, and at meetups.\n\nMany of the critics oppose the bitcoin is money initiative because – quite frankly – they like the fact that bitcoin is not regarded as money. More specifically, many like the fact that the Dutch bitcoin ecosystem is relatively unregulated; they believe that this is the best way to provide for a business friendly climate that is welcoming to companies, and fit for innovation. If bitcoin would be regarded as money under civil law, they fear this could go hand in hand with an increase in regulations, and a higher barrier of entry for bitcoin related businesses.\n\nSome even go so far as to claim that this is an important reason why Bitonic wants bitcoin regulated as money in the first place. As one of the biggest – if not the biggest – bitcoin related businesses in the country, Bitonic has been working to establish a regulated bitcoin exchange in the Netherlands for over a year. As a unique selling point, Bitonic wants this exchange to be fully licensed to hold customers' money. Bitonic has therefore submitted a request for a payment service provider license at the Dutch central bank – but has been waiting for approval ever since. If bitcoin gets to be regulated as money in the Netherlands, these critics say, Bitonic might not only have their application approved more easily, but the high level of entry could shut the door for their competition at the same time.\n\nAs a critical part of the Dutch bitcoin community grew increasingly angry, many targeted their dismay at Bitonic, the initiators of the appeal. Others aimed their chagrin towards Hofman specifically, because of his double role as both Bitonic CEO and board member of the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation. Others were displeased with the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation itself, since their involvement suggested that the higher appeal was filed on behalf of the Dutch bitcoin community as a whole – which it was clearly not.\n\nThe Split\n\nTwo weeks after the launch of the initiative, the split in the Dutch bitcoin community became apparent. First, Hofman admitted he felt a conflict of interest by serving on the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation's board, and submitted his resignation. As another two weeks passed, he was followed by another board member in favor of the 'bitcoin is money' initiative, Carl Kuntze, although Kuntze did not formally acknowledge whether the 'bitcoin is money' initiative itself had anything to do with his decision.\n\nAs such, the only board member who was opposed to the ‘bitcoin is money’ initiative, Bitcoin Wednesday organizer Richard Kohl, remained on the board. He was quickly joined by Alwin de Romijn and Robbie Hontelé, who were both strongly opposed to the initiative as well. As such, the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation has now officially disavowed any association with the initiative via a blog post on the website of Bitcoin Wednesday, stating: “Bitcoin is much more than money. The financial applications of decentralized Blockchain technology are only the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nBitonic, however, will push forward with its efforts, and has officially submitted the appeal several weeks ago. Hofman said that while “satisfying everyone is our aim, but we are aware of the fact that this is not always possible.”\n\nAs an active member of the Dutch Bitcoin community, the author has helped organize some of the Bitcoin Wednesday meetups in the past, and had a referral program with Bitonic on his Dutch Bitcoin news site Coincourant, although this never earned him more than a couple of bucks. He has also organized a debate on the 'bitcoin is money' initiative, and is an outspoken critic of the initiative himself.\n\nNote: The author reached out to the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation for an additional comment. While he did receive an answer, this answer was too long to publish as a quote in this story, and the foundation did not agree with the attempt the author made to edit or rephrase the answer, nor was the foundation willing or able to provide a significantly shorter answer.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Like Purcell’s other “semi-operas”, The Indian Queen was really incidental music hitched to a play. On the rare occasion that this marathon entertainment has been exhumed, the present-day audience yawned and slumbered, so there is an opening for a director with a sense of adventure. Peter Sellars, an avowed Purcell lover, has gone for a root-and-branch rewrite. The advance advertising promised a new story set among the Maya, with colourful sets, dancing, and extra music by Purcell. Could this be a 21st-century take on the lavish, frothy, baroque theatre of Purcell’s day? We should have known better. Sellars does not “do” frippery. All of the above are there on the stage, so there is no case for trading standards officials, but Sellars’ purpose is deeply, exhaustingly serious. A narrator (she has been given a microphone, so we can hear her) reads passages from Rosario Aguilar’s The Lost Chronicles of Terra Firma, in which a Mayan woman tells how her people suffered in the savagery of the Spanish conquest. Sellars gets to ride several of his hobby-horses at the same time — racial inequality, feminism, imperial injustice — and Purcell gains an underlying story with a strong moral purpose. Where, though, was the firm editorial hand when it was needed? The promise of extra music has resulted in a jumbo-sized compendium of Purcell’s greatest hits. There are glorious moments — Vince Yi’s shining male soprano in “Sweeter than Roses”, the ENO Chorus (albeit technically stretched) closing the first half with “Hear My Prayer, O Lord”, and any of the heart-rending great solos with the heavenly Lucy Crowe — but way too much has been stuffed into this all-singing, all-dancing Purcell jamboree. Surely the whole point of reworking The Indian Queen was to give the audience a succinct, sure-fire evening? At three-and-a-half hours, Sellars’s version rambles garrulously, and the conductor, Laurence Cummings, should never have allowed the music to be drawn out with self-indulgent pauses between one phrase and the next. Didn’t the Maya have barbers? This overlong show is badly in need of a short-back-and-sides.

Mr Fridman’s investment vehicle LetterOne Group is acquiring RWE Dea, the oil and gas arm of Germany’s RWE, in a €5bn deal due to complete on Monday. The businessman is creating a new group called L1 Energy to be chaired by former BP chief Lord Browne, which will build on the Dea assets to create a global oil and gas company. But Dea’s ownership of the North Sea gasfields has turned into an obstacle to the deal. The Department of Energy and Climate Change said over the weekend that it would block Mr Fridman from buying the UK assets from RWE. Fridman threatens legal action against UK Play video Ed Davey, energy secretary, cited fears over the effect on UK oil and gas production of any tightening of sanctions against Russia. He said the companies’ proposal to keep the North Sea fields separate from LetterOne Group’s other energy businesses for several years had failed to alleviate his concern over the possible effects on their “continued operation”. A government statement said: “If the proposed acquisition were to proceed in its current form, he [Mr Davey] would be minded to require the companies to arrange for a further sale to a suitable third party.” The dispute is a setback for Mr Fridman, who has built up a fortune in Russia and is now seeking to diversify into other markets. His alliance with Lord Browne, one of the most respected figures in the global energy industry, is pivotal to those efforts. The UK’s warning is the first time a western government has publicly intervened in a corporate transaction because of concerns over sanctions against Russia being tightened and underlines how Russian businessmen are being caught in the crossfire between the west and the Kremlin. However, RWE and LetterOne believe they have a plan for dealing with the risk posed by future sanctions. LetterOne said eight authorities, including the EU, Germany and Ukraine had approved the deal. “The UK is the only government to oppose the transaction formally,” it said. “L1 Energy reserves all its rights regarding the Department of Energy and Climate Change decision on this issue including, if a decision is issued, to challenge it as being unlawful.” RWE and LetterOne have proposed that the UK business be operated by Dea but monitored by a separate entity registered in the Netherlands. The foundation would assume full control of Dea’s North Sea business if sanctions were imposed on Luxembourg-based L1 or its owner. RWE confirmed on Sunday that it would buy back the UK business if EU or US sanctions were imposed within a year of the deal being completed. The UK’s decision did not affect Monday’s completion. LetterOne said the UK energy department had “effectively excluded” L1 Energy from acquiring energy assets on the UK continental shelf. Its fund intended “to continue Dea’s commitment to the North Sea, and where possible to expand this commitment”. It added that Dea had invested $1bn to date in the fields, which account for 3-5 per cent of UK gas production, and planned to invest $450m over the next three years “in a province from which many companies are disinvesting”. The Breagh and Clipper South fields are the biggest assets. However, a Whitehall insider said the problems that might arise if the deal went ahead and sanctions were imposed would be “enormous”. Thirteen fields would be affected, of which Dea UK is the operator of five. Twelve are producing. “All of these fields would likely be shut in with serious health and safety and environmental risks,” said the official. For the five Dea-operated fields, the government would probably need “to confront these risks directly”.

03/02/2015,"['Didn’t it tickle your fancy yesterday to find that Bitcoin starts the month of March at the very top of the Wall Street Journal with a banner ad for their feature article? (I’ll assume for the sake of argument that you read the daily bible of the financial world as religiously as it is printed.) Wasn’t it also scintillating to find that Bitcoin’s price, as generally irrelevant as it is, rose a solid 10% over the course of Monday? Coincidence? I think not.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin is about to take over the stock market\n\nBitcoin price takes off Monday morning\n\nBitcoin price was heading back downward all weekend long and dropped to $245 on Sunday, after several days above $250. Then, the deliveries of the WSJ morning edition start hitting the street, and it’s fortunes turn right around, peaking at over $270. Did many investors have buy orders on BTC at $250, and they started getting pulled first thing Monday morning? Sure. Does that explain its passing $270 on Monday night? No. So I’ll happily give WSJ the credit for its bull run. Not the first time the media has influenced a commodity price, and it won’t be the last. Maybe they’ll cut it down in April, and BTC will have to give back the gains? Won’t be the first time for that either.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Making Higher Highs\n\nThe article itself was interesting in that it was formatted for a three-way perspective, from the author’s side, which strangely goes totally unnamed but takes an objective narrator’s view. Then there is Campbell R. Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University in Durham, N.C., who takes the pro-Bitcoin side of it’s abilities as a currency. He is opposed by Eric Tymoigne is an assistant professor of economics at Lewis & Clark College in Portland.\n\nHere are some of the highlights, starting with Mr. Harvey:\n\n“True, bitcoin isn’t backed by any central authority. But that doesn’t matter. Bitcoin exists because users assign value to it. To say it violates the rules of finance because it lacks a central issuer is problematic on many levels. Governments don’t “guarantee” stability of their currencies—look at the ruble and Swiss franc. Similarly, the fair price of a Bitcoin, as measured by the discounted value of future cash flows, may be zero. But the same is true of fiat currencies, including the euro and U.S. dollar. No commodity underpins the value of a euro or dollar. You tend to lose money when you hold cash. This doesn’t deter people from holding cash.”\n\nAnd Mr. Tymoigne had this to say about the digital currency:\n\n“Bitcoins pose a huge liquidity risk. Ultimately, anyone with bitcoins has to convert them into a national unit of account—dollars, say, or euros—to pay taxes or personal debts and to make other transactions. Their extreme volatility makes them a bad bet if one plans to buy a house in a few years, is saving for college or has regular payments on, say, a mortgage or car. If bitcoins were a large asset in a portfolio, the investor’s solvency would be at risk. This certainly would be the case if bitcoins were promoted for poorer individuals who don’t have access to banking today.”\n\nThe article is an entertaining read, so feel free to use the link above. To have at least three people contribute to an article that is featured on the very top of the Monday Edition of the Wall Street Journal says quite a lot about how far Bitcoin has come in financial circles. It is moving the crowd, and this article seemed to move the crowd closer to it. There is no such thing as bad publicity.\n\nWhat is always absent from these debates is the simple fact that Bitcoin is far from a static technology. Multi-signature wallets were created in 2012, and was implemented worldwide last year. Any innovations or improvements come from the end user, not a centralized leadership, one of the many advantages of Bitcoin. There are tens of thousands of people working on improving Bitcoin with new applications every day. And with every successful addition to the ecosystem, all Bitcoin users benefit. Whatever Bitcoin is today, it will be better than that six months from now, a year from now, two years from now, and it never stops growing, adapting, and improving. Bitcoin has come light years from where it was five years ago, and it’s only just a fraction of what it can be to the world. Personally, I’ll bet on the horse that is improving every day for several years over the one that never improves unless forced to do so.\n\nWhen was the last time a fiat currency let the end user add a new idea to improve its usefulness? Why not? Is it because it was poorly designed, or because it was a deliberate act to wield power over the user? Bitcoin doesn’t ask you to make those distinctions. It’s up to you what a Bitcoin can be. A political statement, a long-term investment or a new information highway. A currency, a commodity, or a technological tour de force. It is all of them. The potential designations are many. The opportunities are endless. And it looks like a few more people realized that today thanks to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nGlad to see them open some prime real estate on their publication to such an important discussion. Balanced journalism works.\n\nPhoto provide by kiosko.net and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nDo you give the Wall Street Journal credit for the Bitcoin bull-run Monday? Share above and comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Wall Street Journal reports that Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) is about to become the first publicly traded Bitcoin fund. The BIT will be an interesting option for traditional investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin who prefer not to trade Bitcoin as currency. The BIT is sponsored by Grayscale Investments, a part of Silbert’s Digital Currency Group.\n\nCurrently, the BIT, launched in 2013, is a private, open-ended trust that is invested exclusively in bitcoin and derives its value solely from the price of bitcoin. It enables accredited investors, with annual incomes greater than $200,000 or assets of more than $1 million, to gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin for a minimum investment of $25,000 without the challenges of buying and securely storing bitcoin. BIT-accredited investors are shielded from hacking attacks and unregulated entities, which would be appealing for small investors as well. But the BIT hasn’t been publicly available to small investors so far.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins also are planning a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, which will be available to all investors on NASDAQ with the ticker COIN. The launch date is unknown, but Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss say that everything is proceeding according to plan. According to their Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, the value of COIN shares will reflect the dollar exchange rate of Bitcoin on Winkdex.\n\nThe Winklevoss ETF is still going through the lengthy ETF registration process with the SEC. But BIT is taking a shortcut, permitted by a rule that that allows holders of a private fund to sell their shares publicly after a 12-month lockup period and completing a less arduous approval process with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Without SEC registration, the BIT can’t formally be considered as an ETF, but once existing shares are offered publicly it will be equivalent to an ETF in practice.\n\nSilbert said that FINRA granted BIT’s request for a permanent ticker symbol, GBTC, which “is expected to be effective shortly.”\n\nIn a statement, the Digital Currency Group said, “Although we have been assigned a ticker symbol, no assurances can be given as to when or if such trading will commence, or that an active public secondary market for BIT shares will develop or be maintained.”\n\nEach share of BIT is worth approximately one-tenth of a bitcoin. As of Friday, the trust’s net asset value stood at $24.43 per share. The Wall Street Journal article notes that many investors purchased their BIT shares in 2013 when the dollar exchange rate of bitcoin was about $100, so they would make a profit selling now. New investors, including small investors, will be able to buy BIT shares soon.\n\nBitcoin space and the traditional stock market are increasingly converging, and the Bitcoin economy as a whole will continue to have DiY and “underground” aspects. But it is evident that regulated, professional Bitcoin services will become more common, and take Bitcoin closer to mainstream.', 'MGT Capital Investments announced a planned merger with Tera Group, which operates the first regulated U.S. Bitcoin derivatives exchange. The merger will create the first publicly traded U.S. Bitcoin derivatives exchange.\n\nAs observed by The Wall Street Journal, this is a reverse merger where Tera will take a controlling stake in MGT. Tera doesn’t seem too interested in MGT’s gaming operations, so the operation is primarily a way for Tera to go public. In other words, Tera is buying a public listing on the stock market for its Bitcoin operations.\n\nTera has played a leading role in the development of Bitcoin derivatives. In September 2014, Tera launched TeraExchange, the first regulated U.S. Bitcoin derivatives exchange, and TeraBit, a spot Bitcoin price index based on real-time data from a number of Bitcoin exchanges. The TeraBit price index is used as the settlement rate for USD/Bitcoin derivatives transactions.\n\nTera is active in the Bitcoin space, which is booming. Forget the highly volatile dollar exchange rate of Bitcoin, the important parameters are the number/volume of Bitcoin transactions and the venture capital investments in the emerging Bitcoin industry, both of which are skyrocketing. Consumers spend bitcoin online, and investors bet on the innovative potential of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology. Technology expert Peter Diamandis said Bitcoin is going from deceptive to disruptive, and listed Bitcoin among his top tech picks for 2015.\n\nThat should be interesting for investors, but currently only a few publicly traded companies and funds – including Overstock, Bitcoin Shop and the forthcoming Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF – are active in the Bitcoin space. With this announcement, the new Tera-controlled MGT joins the select Bitcoin club.\n\nDerivatives such as Tera’s forwards are the simplest way to expose investors to Bitcoin, especially those investors who prefer not to trade the digital currency itself – and are the easiest way to profit from the ups and downs of the bitcoin-dollar exchange rate.\n\nIn related news, former Goldman Sachs Executive Director Timo Schlaefer announced the launch of Crypto Facilities, a U.K. Bitcoin derivatives broker. This confirms the growing interest of institutional investors in the Bitcoin economy.\n\n“The proposed merger with Tera gives immediate and future value to our stockholders, while creating a robust platform for the growth of the industry’s first publicly listed bitcoin derivatives exchange,” said H. Robert Holmes, Chairman of MGT’s board of directors. “The Bitcoin industry attracted over $400 million of investment capital from some of the world’s most prominent investors over the past 12 months; we see our move today as further progress in the broader adoption of the industry.”\n\n“Growing consumer and merchant adoption of bitcoin is driving demand for regulated capital markets solutions,” said Christian D. Martin, chairman, CEO and co-founder of Tera Group.\n\n“By combining with MGT, Tera will create a unique public offering to support the essential infrastructure needed for a vibrant global bitcoin ecosystem,” Martin said.\n\nIn an interview with CoinDesk, Martin added:\n\n“Bitcoin consumes the majority of our mindshare here in our firm. It’s our bitcoin listing and subsequent certification that has the most commercial possibilities for us right now, and it’s a business we’re very keen to cultivate and nurture along.”\n\nMGT and Tera plan to finalize and execute a definitive agreement by March 16, 2015.\n\nImages via Tera and MGT.', 'The European Central Bank has released a new report on digital currency, describing it as “inherently unstable” but potentially transformative in the realm of payments.\n\nThe ECB study builds off an earlier study published in 2012, offering both a general overview of digital currencies as well as follow-up analysis on the potential benefits and risk of using so-called virtual currency schemes (VCS).\n\nThe central bank, which oversees national-level central banks in the eurozone, suggested in the report that digital currencies could impact the ECB’s ability to function. However, it stopped short of calling digital currencies a threat to its operations because of its lack of widespread adoption among consumers and businesses.\n\nThe report’s authors note:\n\n“Although VCS units are not denominated in euro, they do have the potential to have an impact on monetary policy and price stability, financial stability and the smooth operation of payment systems in the euro area.”\n\nThe viewpoint echoes a report released last year by the Bank of England, which in September acknowledged that, if widely adopted, bitcoin could “severely impair” its ability to govern the UK monetary system. The Bank of England said in a study published last month that the technology could fundamentally change the way that central banks function.\n\nCross-border payments disruption\n\nThe ECB outlined a number of areas in which digital currency development could broadly impact the traditional payments space, noting that defects in the remittance ecosystem could provide an opportunity for the technology to flourish in the long term.\n\nThe report\'s authors state that digital currencies like bitcoin, given their cost structures, make the technology a potentially attractive option for both domestic and international remittances. While acknowledging the technological resources required to build such a network, the ECB notes:\n\n""...there is major room for improvement, especially in [the remittance] field, and hence a VCS could have the potential to offer a better service than traditional providers (banks, money remitters and informal remittance systems).""\n\nThe ECB goes on to say that a significant barrier to broader adoption for remittance is the lack of centralized protections for those who opt to use digital currencies.\n\nECB highlights risk of ‘scamcoins’\n\nAs well as including refrains of central bank warnings about digital currencies, such as a perceived lack of transparency and market volatility, the ECB also touched on the growth of altcoins.\n\nThe report suggested that altcoins may one day serve as future payment networks that, in the eyes of the ECB, could compete with bitcoin given the differences in design, distribution and implementation.\n\nAt the same time, the report highlighted how altcoins pose added risks for investors because of the nebulous nature of some projects, noting:\n\n“It is too early to tell what the future of these altcoins will be. A great many of them could be nothing more than “scamcoins”, ie VCSs that are created with the main objective of swindling naive buyers, either as consumers and payers or as investors.”\n\nSpecific risks named in the report include a lack of specific information about an altcoin network\'s management, premining and market illiquidity.\n\nThe full ECB report on digital currencies can be found below:\n\nVirtual Currency Schemes - A Further Analysis\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

There have been electronic cash attempts that have dated back to the 1980’s in the U.S., and PayPal was created to be a new online currency. The timing was perfect, as regulations were light for online businesses back then, as the Internet was only ten years old, and regulators were still several years behind the curve. Now, Bitcoin has succeeded in making a new global online currency anyone can use for free, and Peter Thiel has some commentary on its progress.\n\nPayPal founder talks about Bitcoin\n\nLegendary investor and PayPal creator Peter Thiel tried and failed to make a Bitcoin-like online currency ten years before Satoshi Nakamoto made it a reality. Instead, he made PayPal a leader in global payments systems and was asked about where Bitcoin stands today versus something like PayPal at the ButtonWood Gathering in New York earlier this month.\n\n“PayPal had these goals of creating a new currency. We failed at that, and we just created a new payment system. I think Bitcoin has succeeded on the level of a new currency, but the payment system is somewhat lacking. It’s very hard to use, and that’s the big challenge on the Bitcoin side.”\n\nCommon refrains for new Bitcoin users are it can be difficult to obtain Bitcoin, hard to determine a value for products sold in Bitcoin versus a common currency like the dollar when you use less than 1 BTC, and general unit bias. Opening a Bitcoin account is MUCH easier than opening a PayPal account, even over 15 years after PayPal has established itself. You’d thing they’d figure out how to start a new account in less than a week. Bitcoin will have you up and running the same day.\n\nRegarding Bitcoin as an eventual replacement for a fiat currency like the U.S. Dollar, his view is very simple and pragmatic.\n\n“As long as you have to have dollars to pay your taxes, if you don’t have dollars to pay your taxes, people with guns will come after you and lock you up, or do something bad to you. You can use Bitcoin to pay your taxes. You still have to convert Bitcoins into dollars to pay taxes. So on that level, it doesn’t threaten the dollar as a reserve currency, which is ultimately backed by military/law enforcement power.”\n\nAs I’ve stated before, Bitcoin is not designed to replace the U.S. Dollar, especially as a global reserve currency. It could work as a currency for a very small nation, nothing the size of the U.S.. Bitcoin is not here to replace dollars, but it is here to make them obsolete like the Internet makes newspapers passe. Smaller nations like Ecuador are working on heading off Bitcoin’s market demand, and making centralized electronic monetary systems their vision of the future.\n\nMore and more countries struggle with the many inherent flaws of the fiat currency system, massive debt being primary among them. These countries will now start to entertain a non-debt based system like Bitcoin as a way out of that debtor’s prison. It’s not for everybody, but for those governments that believe Bitcoin is here for the long-run and will appreciate as designed, the one that takes the plunge can make out like bandits, if they play their card right. That would symbolize true economic leadership and foresight.\n\nWho’s ready to take that step forward? The way debt-based fiat currency driven economies are crumbling worldwide, we may find out sooner than we think.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\nAgree or disagree with Peter Thiel? Share above and comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price continued skyrocketing to record a high of $267 earlier today, so the price is now well over the $256 level that resisted the bulls for a rather long time. It seems that bitcoin price will continue rising to the $300 level within the next few days.\n\nLet’s take a look at the 1 day Bitfinex (BTC/USD) charts from tradingview.com and plotting the MACD indicator and RSI. To better understand the new bullish trend, we will plot a Fibonacci retracement fan across a trend line that extends between the high reached on the 13th of November 2014 ($474.77) and the low reached on the 14th of January ($165.62) (look at the below chart). We can notice the following:\n\nBitcoin price has just broke through the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement fan level and bitcoin is now trading at a price greater than the 20 and 50 day EMAs.\n\nAccording to the new Fibonacci retracements, bitcoin price will face resistance at $284 and $320 which correspond to the 61.8% and 50% retracement levels respectively. If the price continues to be above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement fan level, we are likely to see it increase to test the $284 level within the next 24 hours.\n\nThe MACD indicator’s value is now in the positive territory and the blue MACD line is higher than the red signal line, so the bullish wave is likely to continue pushing the price to higher levels.\n\nThe RSI value is now around 61 and there is space to allow bitcoin price increase even more. However, if the RSI exceeds 70, this can signal reversal of the bullish wave.\n\nBy studying the 1 hour Bitfinex (BTC/USD) chart from tradingview.com and keeping the Fibonacci retracement fan we plotted earlier (look at the below chart), we can spot the new bullish trend as shown by the two orange trend lines on the below chart. Accordingly, we can notice a rising support level and higher highs recorded repeatedly and we can see the price correct down to around $258 before rising up again.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBitcoin price continued rising yesterday. Our technical analysis predicts that bitcoin price will continue rising to $284 within the next 24 hours.\n\nCharts from Bitfinex\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

There are many different ways to book a flight with bitcoin, and there's even more than one way to fly. I thought you could use a guide.\n\nHere are the top eight ways to get from A to B without mucking around in fiat:\n\n1. Book through CheapAir or BTCTrip: These services interface with the airlines and handle payment, just like Expedia, Travelocity, etc.\n\nThe commission fees are next to nothing, and you don't have to place your credit card information into the hands of (yet another) breach-able corporation.\n\n2. Fly an airline that accepts bitcoin directly, like AirBaltic: This Latvia-based airline set the stage for others to follow when they began accepting bitcoin in mid-2014. It should be noted – their coverage extends far outside Latvia.\n\n3. Book a private jet: While the idea may seem lavish at first, private jets aren't always as spendy as you might think. In fact, bitcoin-accepting private jet companies like JetVizor routinely post single seats that need to be filled at a last minute. These last-minute rates are cheaper than their usual rates, and are sometimes even comparable with regular airline rates.\n\n4. Use a Bitcoin-for-trade service like Brawker: If it's available for bitcoin, a buyer on Brawker will get it for you. Bitcoin buyers on Brawker are also accustomed to giving 10 % discounts on orders, so you could even save money on a ticket this way.\n\n5. Book through a bitcoin-accepting digital assistant like Magic: If convenience is the name of your game, a digital personal assistant like Magic is another way to book a flight for bitcoin. Just text the word “Magic” to (408) 217-1721 to start the process.\n\n6. Take a trip into outer space with Virgin Galactic: So a flight to space won't get you to Cleveland, but if you're the type who likes to aim big in life, your bitcoins will get you out of the stratosphere. Virgin Galactic has been accepting bitcoins for space trips since 2013.\n\n7. Watch for new airlines to take up UATP on their offer: Apparently payment processing for airlines is the most centralized thing ever. It's all done through a company called UATP. According to The Economist, “UATP merchants provide 95% of global airline capacity, counting among their ranks mainstream brands such as British Airways, Lufthansa, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines.” Watch for these airlines and more to begin accepting bitcoin.\n\n8. Give Mark “Fidel” Hale a call. He sold a startup to Intuit and used the proceeds to buy a jet with bitcoin insignia emblazoned on it. He now takes the jet to various events to spread the word of cryptocurrency. His jet may be a long shot to get you to Florida for that meeting, but maybe Hale wouldn't mind the company, after all.\n\nWhile you're paying bitcoin for flights below the stratosphere (or saving up for a trip to, well, the moon), remember that Expedia takes bitcoin for hotel bookings, and AirBnB and Uber may soon accept it as well.\n\nDo you know of any other ways to book transportation or lodging with cryptocurrency?

Financiers, that are far away from technology, say bitcoin has no intrinsic value. We decided to do the job of a fair price measurement that will help investors assess the attractiveness of bitcoin.”\n\nALFAquotes also includes an indicator of bitcoin’s potential, now +99.87%, calculated as the difference between fair price and market price.\n\nHertz went on to express his hope that the fair price, if widely adopted, would become a useful metric for market analysts, investors and mining companies, among others.\n\nHistorical influence\n\nThough focused on the digital currency markets, Hertz indicated that the tool is inspired by the Benjamin Graham formula, a tool first proposed by Graham, the so-called 'father of value investing'.\n\nThe Benjamin Graham formula seeks to calculate the intrinsic value of an asset by including such factors as 12-month earnings per share and the company’s long-term earnings growth estimate, as well as corporate bond yields.\n\nHertz explained that ALFAquotes uses the formula as a model, though it is perhaps most influenced by metrics for the fair price of gold.\n\n“We decided to assess the fair price of bitcoin as gold,” he explained.\n\nHowever, such formulas are only models for investors, as evidenced by the ability for gold market analysts to reach varied conclusions on its value that may differ even more greatly than the cost ascribed by the market.\n\nCalculating a ‘fair’ price\n\nHertz explained that the fair price formula includes two factors.\n\nFirst, it calculates the changes in the cost of mining equipment and its performance. Next, it attempts to assess the change in difficulty of production, factoring in the electricity costs faced by miners on the network.\n\nIn particular, Hertz indicated that the fair value tool should be embraced by miners, as the price today is lower than the fair price – a factor he attributes to the recent string of bankruptcies and closures in the sector.\n\nHertz predicted that this trend is likely to continue until issues faced by the mining community affect supply to the point it influences demand.\n\n“At the moment, as we can see bitcoin is doubly underestimated and this indicates how good investment attractiveness is toward bitcoin,” Hertz added.\n\nPrice image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'If you operate an exchange, bitcoin automated teller machine or any other money services operation that does business with Quebec residents, you will need to comply with its updated Money Services Businesses Act regardless of where in the world you are based.\n\nThis new policy document was first made public on February 1, 2015 (updated to March 1, 2015), and experts have been trying to determine what it means for bitcoin businesses both within Quebec and outside its borders.\n\nThe document says that anyone offering money services (that is, currency exchange; funds transfer; issue or redemption of traveler’s checks, money orders or bank drafts; check cashing; and operation of an automated teller machine) must be licensed by Quebec’s Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), or the Authority of Financial Merchants, in order to do business with clients in Quebec.\n\nFor companies not based in Quebec, that means hiring a local representative in the province, usually a lawyer or law firm, to handle the paperwork and act on their behalf in any dealings with the AMF.\n\nIn a recent clarification email received by the Bitcoin Embassy on February 26, the AMF confirmed that certain digital currency businesses, such as exchanges (online or in person), need to possess a funds transmitter license to operate. But the details surrounding what type of business models are subject to this license category still needs further clarification, says Jillian Friedman, legal counsel for theBitcoin Embassy in Montreal.\n\nThe email also states that the new interpretation of the MSB law will take effect immediately: There is no grace period. The AMF representative said, however, that those businesses that submit requests for a license within a reasonable time and who cooperate with the AMF will normally be allowed to continue their business activities while their license request is being processed.\n\nAmber Scott, founder and Chief AML Ninja at Outlier Solutions Inc. broke down the policy document in a recent Decentral Talk Live episode, as well as in a follow-up interview for Bitcoin Magazine. (Watch the full Decentral Talk Live episode on decentral.tv here.)\n\n“There are no special circumstances for small businesses who might have one or two interactions with clients in Quebec,” she said. Scott said that companies who do business with Quebecois clients have two practical options at the moment: Register with the Quebec Autorité or stop doing business in the province. For online money services businesses, that would mean filtering and blocking all traffic originating from a Quebec IP address.\n\nAs for ensuring compliance, Scott expects that the AMF likely will begin by focusing on companies doing a significant amount of business in Quebec. Anyone found not to be registered would probably receive a letter requesting compliance with the policy, followed by further enforcement measures.\n\nThe Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal, home to its own bitcoin ATM, came out with the following response shortly after learning about the new policy statement:\n\n“While we welcome the intention of the Province of Quebec’s financial regulator … to clarify the regulation of bitcoin ATMs, we are surprised by the lack of transparency and involvement of the Bitcoin community in this decision. However, this development had been expected by the community, and the Bitcoin Embassy views this decision as an implicit recognition that Bitcoin is indeed a legitimate monetary alternative to fiat currencies.”\n\nThe Bitcoin Embassy also expressed surprise that the AMF did not wait to see what regulations its federal counterpart, FINTRAC, is currently drafting. The Embassy statement noted that Quebec is now the only province that imposes these requirements on Bitcoin ATM operators.', ""When sending payments, popular services PayPal and SWIFT allow users to attach private messages that add an explanation about the payment. Before now, bitcoin services haven't supported this feature. However, CoinSpark just launched a tool that works that accomplishes this for bitcoin transactions. They open sourced this tool so that developers can implement the feature in their own applications.\n\nThese messages, inserted as metadata on the blockchain, give context for the transaction. Users can explain that a transaction is payment for a loan, for instance, or payment for a bet. The message can come in a variety of forms, whether an explanatory note, an invoice, or a video. Only the sender and receivers can view the message.\n\nThis is how the message looks before sent:\n\nThis is how it looks on the receiving end:\n\nCoinSpark is a colored coin protocol that allows users to move assets around the blockchain much like Counterparty. In a practical sense, CoinSpark is more decentralized than Counterparty though. The Counterparty protocol is itself decentralized, but it requires a full node to run. “The guiding principle of CoinSpark is that users can use a lightweight wallet on their computer,” said Gideon Greenspan, CEO of CoinSpark in a Skype call.\n\nUsers can add messages to asset transactions, as well as traditional bitcoin transactions.\n\n“I think it goes a little bit beyond that though,” said Gideon Greenspan. When a bitcoin transaction is sent from one party to another party, a hash of the message is embedded in the blockchain. Both the sender and the recipient can verify the message. It remains on the blockchain forever and no one can tamper with it.\n\n“They can prove the message exists very easily without having to go to a notary, or without having to go to any kind of a central intermediary,” he said.\n\nThe future is somewhat like another messaging service we're all familiar with. “You could look at it a little bit like email, but with notarization,” Greenspan said. Users can even choose to use the feature to notarize important emails.\n\nRight now, users can send these notarized messages with the SparkBit wallet, a free and open source fork of the MultiBit wallet, which works with CoinSpark protocol. The company has open sourced the fully documented software libraries in six languages, (C/C++, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, Ruby) so other developers can implement the messaging feature.\n\nCoinSpark uses federated servers to deliver the messages. The hash of the message, as well as the server address, is stored in the OP_RETURN field.\n\nThe 40 byte OP_RETURN fields, often used to include metadata, has been the subject of fierce debate. Critics say that services that are embedding extra content into transactions are getting a free ride. Supporters claim that bitcoin is a permissionless playground—innovators don't need to call up the bitcoin core developers for approval. “It goes back to the question: Is bitcoin a currency or is it a platform for other applications?” Gideon explained.\n\nBut for the forseeable future, services like CoinSpark are taking advantage of the 40 bytes of OP_RETURN space. And this new messaging feature is another example of that.\n\nWhile messaging is exclusive to SparkBit right now, Greenspan says that CoinSpark is in talks with “major wallets” who are interested implementing it sometime down the road.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Part two of a six part series on Bitcoin.\n\nRarely do we get to see the creation of a new currency, let alone one that is so different from previous currencies. This creates major challenges in comprehension and comfort for most people.\n\nBitcoin can be compared to the advent of paper currency years ago when everyone was using gold and silver coins. Then, it must have seemed strange and confusing to attribute value to little pieces of paper instead of precious metals. Today, paper currency feels fairly safe, and trading paper for a purely digital asset like bitcoins seems odd. Furthermore, the economic and social consequences of switching to a decentralized digital currency are still unclear. Even Satoshi and the early volunteers who helped develop the concept could not have imagined precisely how Bitcoin would be used and valued by society, much as the creators of the Internet in the 1980s could not have predicted how transformative it would become.\n\nConfusion also stems from the fact that Bitcoin is a truly complex technology. It relies not only on Satoshi’s breakthrough to achieving consensus on a distributed network but also on modern cryptographic techniques, such as digital signatures, public/private key pairs, and secure hashing.\n\nThe issuing of new currency occurs through a cryptographic lottery called mining that anyone can participate in. Mining simultaneously processes transactions made by Bitcoin users. To resist abuse from those who might want to destroy the network, Bitcoin’s design uses game theory to align the incentives of those who maintain the network and those who want to act in their own selfish interest.\n\nPut simply, you cannot learn and completely understand Bitcoin in a single afternoon. However, we hope this book will help you understand the basics of Bitcoin as quickly as possible.\n\nWe are all Bitcoin beginners, and no one can predict with any clarity how Bitcoin will evolve, even a year or two into the future.\n\nOn the upside, this means that if Bitcoin becomes widely used in the future, the potential exists for you to become one of the early experts in\n\nBitcoin, since you are studying this technology at such an early stage. We hope you will be inspired by the ideas behind Bitcoin and will make your own contributions to this wonderful technology in years to come.\n\nIn our experience, the simplest way to get a person excited about Bitcoin is to have him purchase something with it. That’s how we got hooked ourselves.\n\nBitcoin works. After reading this chapter, you’ll understand the basics of Bitcoin—enough to chat about it at any cocktail party.\n\nIn the Bitcoin system, everyone cooperates to keep track of everyone else’s money no central authority (e.g., bank or government) is involved. To best understand how the system works, let’s walk through an example using dollars first.\n\nImagine only $21 million exists in the world, and there also exists a detailed list of all the people who possess that money. Everyone, including you (even though you have only $5), has a copy of this list. When you give $2 to your friend, you must subtract $2 from your entry on the list and add $2 to her entry. After informing her of the transaction, she updates her list as well. In fact, everyone in the world needs to update the list; otherwise, the list would be inaccurate. Therefore, not only do you need to notify your friend, but you also need to publicly announce that you are updating the list. If you tried to cheat the system and send your friend $1,000, your cheating attempt would be easy to catch because everyone knows you have only $5 to give.\n\nNow, imagine that all transactions are carried out on computers that communicate via the Internet, and replace dollars with bitcoins. This is how Bitcoin works. Pretty simple actually. So why does Bitcoin seem so complex?\n\nThe answer is threefold: First is the tricky question of how the units of any new currency system (whether bitcoins or seashells) should be valued.\n\nShould a haircut be worth 5000 bitcoins or 0.005 bitcoins? Second, many small details are involved in implementing and using Bitcoin, even though the overall concept is fairly straightforward. For example, how do you obtain a copy of the list, and how are bitcoins initially distributed? Third, an entire lexicon of new and unfamiliar words (e.g., mining) is used in the Bitcoin world.\n\nWe’ll leave the first point about the value of bitcoins for a later chapter.\n\nIn this chapter, we’ll address the last two points by explaining the major concepts used in Bitcoin, namely the Bitcoin address, the private key, the Bitcoin wallet, and the blockchain. We’ll also briefly discuss Bitcoin mining and walk you through the process of receiving and sending your first bitcoins so you can see how the system works. But first, you need to understand the Bitcoin units in more detail.\n\nBITCOIN UNITS\n\nBitcoin refers collectively to the entire currency system, whereas bitcoins are the units of the currency. Although the total currency supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins, each one can be subdivided into smaller denominations; for example, 0.1 bitcoins and 0.001 bitcoins.\n\nThe smallest unit, a hundred millionth of a bitcoin (0.00000001 bitcoins), is called a satoshi in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto. As a result, goods can be priced in Bitcoin very precisely, and people can easily pay for those goods in exact change (e.g., a merchant can price a gallon of milk at 0.00152374 bitcoins, or 152,374 satoshis).\n\nRather than writing the term bitcoins on price tags, merchants commonly use the abbreviated currency code BTC or XBT; 5 bitcoins would be written as 5 BTC. Despite the fact that the BTC abbreviation has been widely used since the beginning of Bitcoin’s development, more recently some merchants and websites have started using XBT because it conforms better to certain international naming standards.1 As bitcoins have appreciated in value, it has become increasingly common to work with thousandths or even millionths of bitcoins, which are called millibitcoins (mBTC) and microbitcoins (?BTC), respectively. Many people have suggested simpler names for Bitcoin’s smaller denominations, and one that has gained traction is referring to microbitcoins (quite a mouthful) as simply as bits.\n\n1 bitcoin = 1 BTC or 1 XBT\n\n1 BTC = 1,000 mBTC\n\n1 mBTC = 1,000 ?BTC\n\n1 ?BTC = 100 satoshis = 1 bit\n\nNow that you know the terms for various Bitcoin units, you need to increase your Bitcoin vocabulary, so let’s talk about what is meant by a Bitcoin address.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin for the Befuddled look for the third article in this series called The Bitcoin address edition of CDN Now.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nConrad Barski has an M.D. from the University of Miami, as well as nearly 20 years of programming experience. Barski is a cartoonist, programmer, and the author of Land of Lisp. He’s been using bitcoins since 2011.\n\nChris Wilmer holds a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Northwestern University and is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Wilmer’s first purchase with bitcoin was a bag of honey caramels from a farm in Utah. They were delicious.', ""This research is courtesy of Sander Duivestein, professional speaker and trendwatcher at VINT, the International Research Institute of Sogeti\n\nLast weekend JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the United States, published a job opportunity for an associate at its New York branch. One of the requirements was an, “opinion on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.” The bank has since deleted the remark, but the Wall Street Journal managed to write about it before JPMorgan could delete it.\n\nThe cover-up marks a radical change in how banks now see the enfant terrible of currencies. JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon dismissed Bitcoin as a, “terrible store of value. It could be replicated over and over. It doesn’t have the standing of a government. […] And honestly, a lot of it — what I’ve read from you guys — a lot of it is being used for illicit purposes.”\n\nThrough the Trough of Disillusionment: from evil to good\n\nBut Dimon was not alone in his crusade against Bitcoin. Other giants from the financial world shared his opinion. Alan Greenspan, the former president of the Federal Reserve, was baffled by the digital currency: “You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is. I haven’t been able to do it. Maybe somebody else can.”\n\nAccording to Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York’s Department of Financial Services, the cryptocurrency created “a virtual Wild West for narco-traffickers and other criminals.” Even Nobel Prize-winning Op-Ed columnist Paul Krugman asked himself in one of his weekly columns for the New York Times if Bitcoin isn’t just “evil“.\n\nNowadays the financial world is reconsidering their opinion about Bitcoin. In the beginning of September 2014 the Bank of England published a report that describes the blockchain — the distributed ledger of Bitcoin — as a, “significant innovation’ that has ‘far-reaching implications”.\n\nIn February 2015 the Bank refined their opinion: “Creating such a system would entail creating a protocol for value transfer over the internet, akin to what Berners-Lee (1989) did for information.” It all reflects the thoughts of Oliver Bussmann, group chief information officer of Swiss bank UBS.\n\nIn an interview with Wall Street Journal he said: “I believe — and this is my personal view — that blockchain technology will not only change the way we do payments but it will change the whole trading and settlement topic.”\n\nBussman believes that blockchain technology has the potential to trigger “massive” simplification of banking processes and cost structure. He added: “When somebody with a strong brand and security level establishes it as a reliable service, then the whole industry will follow. That is my personal prediction.”\n\nBanks are getting undressed\n\nThe total service offerings of banks are stripped by the so called FinTechs. Or ‘unbundled’ as the VC’s from Silicon Valley like to say. Parts of the bank are turned into stand-alone products that are delivered to the consumer at a scale and cost that no traditional bank can match.\n\nThis unbundling happens on two fronts. Top-down there are FinTechs that piggy back on the traditional payments and transaction solutions for fiat currencies. On top of these networks they focus on, “enhancing customer experience, increasing convenience and streamlining the process of using bank and card payment networks.”\n\nThe downside of this development is that banks loose their ability to manage customer experiences by themselves. Banks are moving to the bottom of the value chain.\n\nBottom up FinTechs meanwhile are threatening the market from a cryptocurrencies-point of view. They not only bring finance and technology together, but also reinvent the entire financial system.\n\nIt’s a completely new network protocol that allows value to be exchanged without the need of a trusted intermediary. In this scenario banks hardly play a significant role anymore.\n\nAll kinds of applications are now built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Smartphone apps that will make the underlying complexity invisible to the end users.\n\nIn the near future transferring money and property will be as easy as swiping your finger from left to right. It’s beyond information on your fingertips, it’s exchanging value on steroids (without the need of a trusted party).\n\nA Napster moment for finance\n\nBanks are now extremely worried that they are facing their own Napster moment – the point when the rise of a new platform disseminates a complete industry by offering a simplified experience in a cheaper way and at a scale that makes it impossible to compete with.\n\nJust remember how Napster and it’s descendants — like Spotify and Netflix — have changed the entertainment industry in just a few years. The media industry just let it happen. Incapable of changing their own DNA and culture to adjust to these new technologies. They followed the Shirky Principle: “Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.”\n\nIt’s not strange that Marc Andreessen — one of the founders of Netscape and nowadays venture capitalist in companies like Facebook, Skype, Twitter, LinkedIn and AirBnB – recently said:\n\n“We have a chance to rebuild the system. Financial transactions are just numbers; it’s just information. You shouldn’t need 100,000 people and prime Manhattan real estate and giant data centers full of mainframe computers from the 1970s to give you the ability to do an online payment.”\n\nHis words started an explosion of FinTech-startups. Recent research shows that global investment in FinTech is set to double from $10 billion in 2014 to $19.7 billion in 2015. By 2020, the total is projected to be $46.1 billion. The FinTech scene is so hot, it’s boiling.\n\nAnd if you just look at Bitcoin itself, the numbers are staggering as well. According to Coindesk, Bitcoin startups raised just $2.13 million in 2012. The figure rose to $95.81 million in 2013 and to a stellar $347.29 million in 2014.\n\nIn the first two months of 2015 already $105.84 million has been invested. In The Guardian article ‘Bitcoin: will 2015 be a make-or-break year?’ some other statistics give a broader perspective on the growth and acceptance of bitcoin:\n\n“More bitcoin startups launched than in any year prior (more than 500, compared with around 200 in 2013, according to data from AngelList); and acceptance by major companies continued to spread. (Microsoft, Dell and Overstock.com all accept bitcoin now; publisher Time Inc accepts it for magazine subscriptions.)”\n\nThe exponential growth of Bitcoin\n\nIn July 2014 advisory firm Gartner added cryptocurrencies for the first time to their hype cycle of emerging technologies. In the report they positioned the digital currency between the peak of inflated expectations and the trough of disillusionment. In their view the cryptocurrency needs another 5 to 10 years before it will be accepted.\n\nPeter Diamandis, cofounder of the Singularity University and coauthor of the books ‘Abundance’ (2013) and the recent ‘Bold’ (2015), doesn’t agree with this timeframe. In his view Bitcoin’s growth is best explained by an exponential curve and that’s why it is on a path to become disruptive over the next 1–3 years.\n\nIn the beginning digital technologies follow a linear path before suddenly growing exponentially. Diamands says that Bitcoin is following his framework of the 6Ds: Digitized, Deceptive, Disruptive, Dematerializing, Demonetizing and Democratizing.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is now on a path from deceptive to disruptive and it will threaten the entire financial industry as we know it. In the next stages of his model Bitcoin is eliminating (dematerializing) the use of physical money and even credit cards, then it demonetizes the cost of transactions and consequentley will eliminate the need for middlemen (banks, lawyers, exchanges).\n\nFinally the last stage will be about banking the unbanked — capital and currency will become available to anyone with a connection to the internet (democratizing).\n\nBanks haven’t changed very much since their invention, thanks to Bitcoin they’re now dragged into the 21st century. It’s Digital Darwinism: adapt or die. No wonder that JP Morgan Chase has changed their opinion – and their job postings.\n\nBy (quietly) recruiting new employees with knowledge in bitcoin, they are finally accepting the disruptive power of cryptocurrencies.\n\nRead Next: Stripe now lets all businesses accept Bitcoin payments\n\nRead next: SXSW's official app will hook up with 1,000 iBeacons across Austin"", 'Tera Group Inc, the operator of the US’s first regulated Bitcoin derivative platform Tera Exchange, recently signed a merger agreement with MGT Capital Investment; thereby adding a crucial step that should make the former a publicly listed company.\n\nAccording to the available details, both the parties have currently agreed on some “contemplated” terms of the agreement which will reach its conclusion by March 16th, 2015. But as per now, it is definite that Tera will have a major stake in MGT’s common stock shares (at least 70%).\n\nFrom the look of it, Tera however seems to be disinterested towards interfering in its new partner’s chief operations, related to managing online gaming websites. Instead, the plan here is to meet future demands for regulated capital market solutions, which is expected to go as high as Bitcoin’s consumer and merchant adoption.\n\n“By combining with MGT, Tera will create a unique public offering to support the essential infrastructure needed for a vibrant global bitcoin ecosystem,” said Christian D. Martin, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Tera.\n\nMGT’s Chairman H. Robert Holmes also kept his hopes high from their merge deal, saying that it gives “immediate and future value to their stockholders”. He further supported the idea of Tera to create the US’s first publicly listed Bitcoin derivative platform, citing the enormous investment the industry has received in past 12 months.\n\n“We see our move today as further progress in the broader adoption of the industry,” Holmes concluded.\n\nOnce the plan comes into action, the Tera’s ever-expanding swap services will hopefully mend one of the most disturbing ills of Bitcoin market — the price volatility. Traders will be allowed to counteract risks by simply making profits from Bitcoin’s ups and downs in the USD markets. This will also help Bitcoin achieve better adoption and infrastructure in the future.', 'A bill introduced to the California legislature aims to bring virtual currency businesses more clearly under the state’s Money Transmission Act.\n\nPenned by Assemblyman Matt Dababneh, chairman of the state’s Banking and Finance Committee, AB-1326 would prohibit virtual currency businesses from operating unless they are licensed by the Department of Business Oversight (DBO) or have received an exemption from the agency.\n\nSimilar to the general financial code, license applicants would need to pay a non-refundable $5,000 fee to register; provide certain identifying information; and keep a certain amount of funds in “investment-grade permissible investments”. The definition includes money market funds, state bonds and US government agency securities and excludes virtual currencies.\n\nChris Ramsey, a spokesperson for Assemblyman Dababneh, indicated that the bill is the result of conversations that resulted in the opinion that existing law did not capture bitcoin, thereby requiring the introduction of clarifying law.\n\nRamsey told CoinDesk:\n\n“This bill is something that has been in the works in the state for a couple of years, and as the leader of that committee, Matt dedicated himself on the issue and thought it was the right move to make for the state of California at this time.”\n\nAB-1326 also contains a series of exemptions for US agencies, commercial banks and industrial banks, among other financial entities, a measure that has attracted early criticism.\n\nBusinesses that have already received a license to operate in California, Ramsey said, would be unaffected by the bill.\n\nPast and future concerns\n\nRamsey suggested that the bill is the product of ongoing security concerns over activities in the digital currency space, mentioning the public demise of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox in 2014.\n\n“Mt Gox happened a few years back, where a lot of people had virtual currency that they thought was safe. I think the bill is partly a response to things like that,” he said, adding that the monetary provisions of the measure would discourage fly-by-night operations.\n\nStill, he mentioned that it looks toward a time when bitcoin “plays a bigger part of our economy”.\n\n“Whether it’s lending or traditional financial practices that virtual currency will branch out into, this bill would potentially create a mechanism where the state would already be able to handle things like that,” Ramsey added.\n\nRamsey estimated the bill would not be heard until early April, but that it would likely be updated as part of an ongoing research process.\n\nDuring this time, Ramsey said that Dababneh and his staff would be in talks with state agencies, relevant industry participants and the DBO, the latter of which is currently engaged in pending efforts to regulate bitcoin businesses.\n\nImage via California Assembly\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It should start trading within the next couple of weeks. It is currently listed on the OTC Markets ""pink sheets"" under a temporary symbol, BTCV, but will have a permanent ticker of OTCMKTS: GBTC.\n\nThe fund gives investors a way to invest in Bitcoin without going to the trouble of buying Bitcoin and worrying about having a secure place to store it. It marks another step forward in Bitcoin\'s long march to mass adoption.\n\nIt also opens up Bitcoin ETF investing to regular investors...\n\nHow the First Bitcoin ETF Will Work\n\n\n\nStrictly speaking, the Bitcoin Investment Trust is not an exchange-traded fund . It\'s a hedge fund exploiting a rule that allows owners of the shares to sell them to others after 12 months with FINRA approval. The fund was launched in September 2013, so that time limit has elapsed for the earliest buyers.\n\nUntil now, only accredited investors (individuals with at least $1 million in assets or net income of $200,000 a year) could buy shares. Now those shares can be re-sold into the market.\n\nIn practice, the BIT will function like a gold ETF. The Bitcoin Investment Trust will hold the actual bitcoins. And each share of the fund will be worth about one-tenth of a bitcoin.\n\nThe debut of the first publicly traded Bitcoin fund is a big positive for the cryptocurrency, but it gets better.\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust will soon have company...\n\nThe Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF Took a Harder Road\n\nThe arrival of the Bitcoin Investment Trust on the OTC Markets means it has beaten the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust . The Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF is expected to get approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sometime this year.\n\nBut going through the SEC is why Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss lost the race. Their Bitcoin ETF, which will use the ticker Nasdaq: COIN, will be a fully compliant exchange-traded fund.\n\nIn that sense, the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF will have more legitimacy than the BIT, since the BIT lacks SEC approval. And it makes the market for Bitcoin Investment Trust shares less reliable, as availability depends on the willingness of current shareholders to sell.\n\nThat\'s why the Winklevoss twins have gone to the extra trouble of meeting SEC requirements with their Bitcoin ETF. They\'ve taken the same strict attitude toward Gemini, a U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange the twins plan to launch.\n\nLooking at the big picture, having publicly traded Bitcoin funds means Wall Street is getting behind the digital currency.\n\nWhat the Arrival of Regulated Bitcoin ETFs Means\n\nGovernment-blessed Bitcoin ETFs offer a glimpse of a future in which Bitcoin will be an integral part of the financial system.\n\n""The Bitcoin industry is moving faster than any one person can fully comprehend,"" said Money Morning Defense & Tech Specialist Michael Robinson. ""I believe 2015 will mark a turning point in the brief history of this fast-growing virtual currency.""\n\nThe flow of big money into Bitcoin tells us the digital currency is here to stay. And Bitcoin ETFs are just one example.\n\nVenture capitalists poured $347.27 million into Bitcoin-based startups last year and $105.83 million in just the first two months of 2015.\n\nAnd some of that money is coming from Wall Street\'s most venerable institutions. In January, the New York Stock Exchange led a $75 million round of Series C funding for Bitcoin payments and wallet platform Coinbase.\n\nLast fall the Tera Exchange became the first Bitcoin derivatives platform to win approval from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. And Tera has strong ties to Wall Street. CEO Christian Martin worked for both Merrill Lynch and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). Chief Commercial Officer John McGuire spent 18 years at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).\n\nLast month former Goldman executive director Timo Schlaefer launched Crypto Facilities Ltd., a Bitcoin derivatives operation based in London.\n\nHigh-level Wall-Street types would not take lead roles in Bitcoin ventures unless they believed in the future of the digital currency. They know the almost limitless uses for the blockchain - the technology that underpins Bitcoin - is where its true value lies.\n\nBitcoin ETFs are just one piece of this much bigger puzzle.\n\n""This will be the year that Bitcoin moves beyond its realm as the world\'s leading virtual currency to become a major global force,"" Robinson said.\n\nAfter The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the Bitcoin ETF was coming, the Bitcoin price popped 9.4%. CoinDesk\'s Bitcoin Price Index rose as high as $270.24 Monday - its highest level since late January.\n\nBIT is sponsored by Grayscale Investments, part of SecondMarket Inc.\'s spin-off Digital Currency Group. Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group, is a prominent Bitcoin advocate. Until the GBTC ticker goes live, Merriman Capital will supply quotes under the temporary symbol. Merriman has 30-day exclusivity to make a market in the shares.\n\nThe Bottom Line: The Bitcoin Investment Trust gives investors a way to invest in Bitcoin without buying and holding it. While technically a hedge fund, it will function like a gold ETF. Along with the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, the BIT heralds deeper involvement from Wall Street types, which will speed mass adoption.\n\nHow to Use a Bitcoin ATM: A Bitcoin ETF is a good way to invest in Bitcoin, but what if you want to buy Bitcoin to spend it? Don\'t laugh. Within the next decade, using Bitcoin to buy things will be commonplace. And the easiest way to get those bitcoins will be from a Bitcoin ATM.

Madison St. Baltimore, MD, 21201.', 'South Korean bitcoin services company Coinplug has enabled bitcoin purchases with credit cards through over 7,000 regular cashpoint ATMs across the country.\n\nAs well as being the first to sell bitcoins through ATMs not specifically designed for that purpose, it will be the first credit card to bitcoin service in the country.\n\nThe move, which allows customers to pay for Coinplug\'s prepaid okBitcard service, will make bitcoin available in many of South Korea\'s highest-traffic locations, including subway stations, convenience stores and busy city streets.\n\nBuilding infrastructure\n\nThe new service was made possible through a deal with Korean ATM manufacturer Nautilus Hyosung, Korea\'s largest ATM hardware producer – the world\'s fourth biggest. The firm currently has 7,000-9,000 active machines in South Korea.\n\nNautilus Hyosung also produced a bitcoin-specific ATM for Coinplug that has been installed in a cafe in Seoul\'s Gangnam district since March 2014. The machine allows two-way trades, meaning users can buy or sell bitcoin, but accepts cash only.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Coinplug\'s Richard Yun said that when signing up new merchants to accept bitcoin, his team found the biggest concern was that bitcoin is too difficult for ordinary people to obtain.\n\nHe likened it to Elon Musk\'s problem with Tesla – many customers are curious about electric cars, but are reluctant to buy them due to the lack of charging infrastructure.\n\nHow to buy bitcoins\n\nTo use the system, customers select \'okBitcard\' from the ATM\'s greeting screen, enter a phone number and date of birth for identification, insert a credit card and print a paper receipt. The receipt includes a PIN code that can then be redeemed for bitcoin value via Coinplug\'s smartphone app or the okBitcard site.\n\nThe video below demonstrates how it is done:\n\nLike-minded partners\n\nCoinplug CEO Ryan Uhr said agreeing new deals has not been difficult, since its business partners, such as Nautilus Hyosung and online payments provider Galaxia Communications, are also fintech companies that believe in bitcoin\'s potential.\n\nHe said:\n\n""We could dramatically increase okBitcard sellers because we shared our vision for bitcoin and digital currency for future payment with our partners.""\n\nThe ATM service is available for fiat values of 10,000, 30,000 and 50,000 South Korean won (approximately $10, $30 and $50). Coinplug says it has plans to expand the service overseas in the future.\n\nIn January, Coinplug began selling okBitcards at over 8,000 7-Eleven convenience stores across South Korea, and plans to expand the scheme to other store chains soon.\n\nUsing the service, customers can also buy okBitcards from cashiers over the counter, receiving the same kind of paper receipt with redeemable code. Yun said that okBitcoin physical cards, which will be available off the shelf at stores, are still being printed.\n\nImage courtesy Coinplug\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

ISIS, we will hunt you, take down your sites, accounts, emails, and expose you…. You will be treated like a virus and we are the cure. We own the Internet.”\n\nThe “we” here is Anonymous, the vaunted global hacking collective that launched a furious online offensive against the Islamic State in early February, and which declared war on the group shortly after the fall of Mosul last June. As the alternative Counter Current News reported (and as Anonymous #OpISIS YouTube videos proudly trumpeted), these attacks exposed more than 6,600 Islamic State-linked Twitter accounts, along with 2,000 email addresses and about 100 IP/VPN channels. Several of the group’s major recruiting sites were also knocked offline.\n\nBut Fawkes’s wire-frame visage sounded about as frustrated as a robot voice can in a subsequent video released on Feb. 11, announcing a third attack. “With our last Operation ISIS, we showed the world and especially governments it’s not that hard to fight back ISIS online. So why’s no government doing it?”\n\nGreat question. How is it that the U.S. government, capable of coordinating a complex air campaign from nearly 6,000 miles away, remains virtually powerless against the Islamic State’s online messaging and distribution network? For months, the militant group’s horrifying, crisply edited videos of death marches, beheadings, and immolations have churned their way through the social media landscape, commanding near-instantaneous global attention. Add to this the group’s use of more intimate web platforms for international recruiting (20,000 foreign fighters from 90 countries at last count), and the scope of the problem only widens.\n\nThese online mouthpieces carry immense strategic value. The Islamic State’s June 2014 offensive into Mosul, for instance, was accompanied by a well-choreographed social media campaign, sowing terror and confusion far in advance of its fighters. Tellingly, when the Iraqi government finally acted, it did so by banning its own citizens’ access to Facebook and Twitter. Within the last month, videos of the Islamic State’s atrocities have resonated so strongly with citizens of Jordan and Egypt that they’ve provoked armed escalation and retaliation by these Arab governments. This is arguably exactly what the Islamic State wants.\n\nIf the United States is struggling to counter the Islamic State’s dispersed, rapidly regenerative online presence, why not turn to groups native to this digital habitat? Why not embrace the efforts of third-party hackers like Anonymous to dismantle the Islamic State — and even give them the resources to do so?\n\nTo date, the State Department’s tiny Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications — with its 21,000-follower “Think Again Turn Away” Twitter account — has been the tip of the spear in the U.S. effort to short-circuit the Islamic State’s propaganda machine. At best, its efforts are like spitting in the wind. At worst, it has been an embarrassment, as when the account confused al Qaeda and the Islamic State in a much-maligned tweet that baffled jihadis around the globe.\n\nAlthough the Obama administration has announced a significant expansion of the office and put forth an encouraging plan to empower networks of university students to counter violent extremism online, these initiatives only address half the problem. As anyone who’s ever gotten in a political debate on Twitter can tell you, the availability of a viable counter-narrative in no way guarantees that somebody will actually listen to it. A remarkable number of people seek out information online with their minds firmly made up. Just as the United States must push back against Islamic State messaging, it must also take steps to tear out its voice box.\n\nThose best suited to this task are not necessarily the thousands of professional hackers at U.S. Cyber Command and related agencies, who are trained and equipped to counter cyberattacks by rogue states and sophisticated non-state actors. Instead, the U.S. government should look to those unaffiliated, socially minded hackers (“hacktivists”) who have their own reasons to despise the Islamic State. This includes self-declared, underutilized “white hat” hackers, who use their expertise to test and improve the cyber-defenses of companies. It also includes those individuals and hacktivist collectives like Anonymous who have had a traditionally antagonistic relationship with the U.S. government.\n\nAlthough a quick stroll through the 4chan image board, Anonymous’s early nesting ground, makes a terrible first impression, the fact is that hacktivists do have a moral compass. The targets selected by Anonymous and other groups — the recording industry and movie studios following the forced shutdown of a popular file-sharing website, accused rapists in Steubenville, Ohio, and even the United States government (following the federal indictment and suicide of hacker Aaron Schwartz) — suggest a loose set of guiding principles. Indeed, Anonymous even briefly joined the Syrian civil war when it hacked the email account of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in 2012. As a rule, hacktivists despise bullying, hypocrisy, and fundamentalism. The Islamic State couldn’t present a clearer target.\n\nWhat might a U.S. “partnership” with dispersed, largely unaccountable — if not uncontrollable — groups of shadowy individuals often at odds with U.S. laws look like?\n\nIt’s a radical idea: a nonprofit foundation, sponsored by the anti-Islamic State coalition and funded through a mix of U.S. public support and private contributions. (Think NPR doing bounty-hunting.) This small institution could issue bite-sized rewards (or tote bags?) for proof of the identification or elimination of Islamic State-linked social media accounts, VPN/IP channels, recruiting websites, or any other sort of online refuge. Defining “proof” here would be a significant engineering challenge — but certainly not as hard as flying unmanned space planes or deploying Star Wars lasers.\n\nSuch bounties could be paid in Bitcoin, an anonymized, volatile cryptocurrency that’s understandably “suspect” to the U.S. government, but that remains popular among secretive online communities. By authorizing the use of Bitcoin, officials would be extending an olive branch to the world’s hacktivists, respecting those critical hacker values of freedom and anonymity. Any other system — involving traceable payments or even potential registration as federal contractors — would almost certainly combust in a storm of paranoia and lightning accusations of government surveillance.\n\nSo long as the initiative attracted attention and payment proved quick, reliable, and tamper-proof — critical when dealing with hackers — it could open a new front in the digital war against the Islamic State. Already, social media administrators are struggling to shut down jihadi accounts at a pace that’s not even close to that with which they are being opened. A crowdsourced hacktivist army could supplement those efforts, identifying and flagging new nodes in the Islamic State’s network the moment they began attracting followers. These paid volunteers could also harass the Islamic State with phishing and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks — the bread and butter of today’s online vigilantes. Strong verification mechanisms could incentivize a more surgical approach to identifications and attacks, limiting collateral damage.\n\nThe effect would be to exert a constant pressure on the Islamic State’s digital operations. Social media companies like Twitter, which have been fighting a long-running game of whack-a-mole against the Islamic State, could get a huge boost in their never-ending effort to track down targets. Long lists of jihadi accounts, compiled by hacktivists and verified by government proxies, could be sent to the immediate attention of social media monitors. Likewise, brute-force DDoS assaults (which overwhelm servers’ nonstop connection requests) against Islamic State websites and forum boards could stymie its global coordination and recruiting drives. Other, stealthier attacks could sow confusion among Islamic State supporters, as with Anonymous’s recent hack that compromised more than 2,000 emails.\n\nThe goal would be to push the Islamic State into deeper and deeper parts of the web. No longer would grisly execution videos trend so quickly worldwide; no longer could the Islamic State so easily pull the strings of public attention. As prospective jihadis (particularly in the West) found it harder to establish contact with recruiters in Iraq and Syria, governments would find it easier to identify and stop them. In time, the Islamic State’s global reach and influence would wane.\n\nThis sort of partnership wouldn’t require any deeper mending of the rifts between hacktivists and the U.S. government. Those attacking the Islamic State and seeking anonymized payment could be greeted with a simple message: “You don’t like us and we often don’t like you. Performing this service will in no way immunize you from applicable domestic laws, now or in the future. But we share a common enemy and will defeat it best by working together.”\n\nIf individuals and groups like Anonymous are performing this service for free today, why pay them? It’s a question that speaks to the dynamics of these decentralized groups. The fact is that, while loose hacktivist collectives are excellent at mounting one-time “operations” to disrupt or disable target networks, they’re much less effective at sustaining that pressure over the long run. Those involved can get bored or distracted. The effort can fizzle.\n\nThis poses a problem. After all, there will never be a single decisive moment — an online Battle of the Bulge — that drives the Islamic State off the Internet for good. So long as the group exists, its fighters will always gravitate toward online services to achieve their goals of international terrorism and recruitment. Accordingly, rolling back the Islamic State’s virtual operations will be a continual task, akin to spraying for pests or mowing a really big lawn. This is the kind of job you pay for.\n\n“Enlisting trolls to fight trolls” sounds like a surreal, distinctly 21st-century idea. It’s not. The United States has often embraced unlikely collaborators to realize strategic goals. In the early 1940s, tens of thousands of American Jeeps rumbled into Nazi Germany — driven by Soviet soldiers. In the 1980s, Afghan mujahideen shot down Soviet helicopters with U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles. In the war-torn Iraq of 2007, the United States showered money on previously hostile Sunni tribes to finally quash al Qaeda’s influence. Even today, Washington navigates tenuous partnerships with Iranian-backed Shiite militias and the terrorist-designated Kurdistan Workers’ Party. By comparison, offering micropayments to socially minded hackers comes across as fairly benign. U.S. soldiers are less likely to one day find themselves on the wrong end of a U.S.-supplied piece of crypto-currency.\n\nThere are plenty of fair objections and points of criticism to a plan like this. For one, it’s truly a stretch to imagine the U.S. government buying up Bitcoin with public money — something that the Internal Revenue Service classifies a highly speculative form of property. Likewise, in an arrangement where hacktivists’ real identities would never be compromised, there could be no guarantee that these hackers would not be using U.S. government money to attack websites under U.S. legal protection (the kind of absurd perpetual-motion machine only federal policy could devise). Finally, the sanctioned employment of hacktivists would push against international norms that have long banned hacking and piracy. This model, harnessed by another government at a later date, could potentially imperil the same U.S. interests it now stands to aid.\n\nNonetheless, rallying a cybermilitia via a smart system of micropayments — therefore expanding the war against the Islamic State without compromising hacktivists’ fringe credentials — is still preferable to ham-fisted alternatives. Too much direct U.S. legal pressure on companies like Twitter, for instance, would run the risk of nationalizing what have become global platforms for conversation and debate. Trying to legislate the Islamic State off the web will do more harm than good. A real, lasting solution requires unorthodox thinking and respect for what the Internet has become.\n\nIn Iraq and Syria, kinetic operations against the Islamic State are proceeding, limiting the reach and power of the insurgent group. Yet on the Internet — on web services and servers largely based in the United States — the Islamic State still operates with impunity. For a war effort that hinges on the marginalization and rejection of its propaganda, this represents a gaping vulnerability. It’s long been a maxim of U.S. military operations that no safe haven should be left to the enemy. This thinking must now extend to the Islamic State’s terrible, pioneering use of the cyber-domain.\n\nLoosely affiliated hacktivists have spent years honing their ability to harass and disrupt in this same domain. They also hate the Islamic State and all it stands for. Why not work with them?\n\nROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/Getty Images', 'Ukraine is currently experiencing the worst period of hyperinflation in the world as the government has imposed capital controls to stop its citizens from dumping the Hryvnia. This can potentially make cryptocurrencies the only viable safe haven for the embattled country’s population.\n\n“Yesterday a 62 year old man managed to get back his money from the bank (after 3 month of persistent attempts) and came to buy bitcoins. He does not trust the state nor the bank and is willing to take the risk of bitcoin volatility.” -Michael Chobanian, the Bitcoin Embassy of Ukraine founder\n\nTrouble in Ukraine\n\nThe situation in the Ukraine has gone from bad to worse. When a country passes Venezuela as the most inflationary place on the planet, things aren’t going so well. According to government statistics, the official headline number on inflation is 28.5% year over year. However, Professor Steve Hanke of the Cato Institute disputes this:\n\n“Using this figure and black-market exchange rate data that the Johns Hopkins-Cato Institute for Troubled Currencies Project has collected over the past year; I estimate Ukraine’s current annual inflation rate to be 272 percent – and its monthly inflation rate to be 64.5 percent. This rate exceeds the 50 percent per month threshold required to qualify for hyperinflation. So, if Ukraine sustains its current monthly rate of inflation for several more months, it will enter the record books as the world’s 57th hyperinflation episode.“\n\nApparently the Ukrainian government has completely under reported the numbers to further its own agenda to avoid mass panic. Sound familiar? Unfortunately, it is bit too late for that as the Ukrainian currency, the hyrvnia, has dropped 70% since the beginning of 2014.\n\nIn previous articles, the causes of hyperinflation have been defined. In the case of Ukraine, it has been caused by systemic corruption, a war with its pro-Russian secessionist eastern regions, which has destroyed a lot of its factories and caused the country to lose a quarter of its industrial capacity. This resulted in a huge output gap and a rapid increase in the money supply to help finance its ongoing war.\n\nRussia is also its largest trading partner so that does not help matters. Ukraine is running massive deficits and as no revenue coming in, the beleaguered nation is on the brink of default.\n\nCapital controls\n\nThe government has attempted to fix the exchange rate in an attempt to quell the panic and a run on the banks. This has led to Ukraine’s minimum wage to be approximately US$42.90 per month, which puts it lower than Ghana or Zambia, the RIA reports. This has led to what resembles typical hyperinflation:\n\n""Food prices among producers rose 57.1 percent, with the price for grains and vegetables rising 91 percent from January 2014 to January 2015, while the official inflation rate over the period totaled 28.5 percent. Meanwhile, Ukrainian consumers responded to economic difficulties by cutting their spending in hryvnias by 22.6 percent, which amounts to an almost 40 percent decrease in real consumption.""\n\nThis rapid rise in inflation and collapse in the currency has led Ukrainian President Poroshenko to take extreme actions and to tighten capital controls even more, which the government has since dialed back slightly.\n\nWhen the Hyrvnia was in free fall Wednesday February 25, the central bank banned banks from buying currency on behalf of their clients for the rest of the week. This was later repealed but it is still near impossible to exchange currency at the banks. In February alone, this has led to a massive spike in the USD/UAH rate as the US dollar continues to surge as people are looking for safe havens.\n\n“Even though officially the foreign exchange limit is 3,000 UAH (hrynvias) per day you still can’t buy or sell foreign currency in the bank,” said the founder the Kuna Bitcoin Agency and The Bitcoin Embassy of Ukraine, Michael Chobanian to CoinTelegraph. “They will not sell you any. So there is practically no liquidity.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“Exchange still works but huge obstacles have been put up. It will take a minimum of 4 days if you want to buy USD (for a company or an importer). The average person does not have access to interbank exchange.”\n\nThis has led to massive growth in the underground economy. The IMF estimates that Ukraine\'s underground—and non-tax-paying—economy is as much as 50 percent of GDP. This has only compounded Ukraine’s problems as government revenues have declined massively.\n\nExchange kiosks on the streets in Kiev were selling limited amounts of dollars for 39 hryvnias - around 20 percent higher than the rates advertised in the windows of commercial banks where dollars were not available.\n\nEven regular citizens in the country are increasingly turning to bitcoin as a safe haven according to Chobanian, who explained:\n\n“[N]owadays I have clients who aren’t even tech savvy looking to buy bitcoin. Yesterday a 62 year old man managed to get back his money from the bank (after 3 month of persistent attempts) and came to buy bitcoins. He does not trust the state nor the bank and is willing to take the risk of bitcoin volatility. The old man said ‘with bitcoin I am sure that I will always get at least something. With the bank I almost lost everything.’”\n\nAs is always the case in hyperinflationary episodes, people are trying to get rid of hyrvnia as soon as they get them since they will be worth less tomorrow. The price of gold has also spiked in UAH terms:\n\nCrypto’s time to shine\n\nIn countries with persistently high inflation rates, such as Argentina and now Ukraine, bitcoin has a real use case. Particularly, when capital controls are introduced making it almost impossible to access other currencies and asset classes.\n\nFor high net worth individuals in these countries, there are ways to trade hard assets like real estate and precious metals for bitcoin, which can easily be sold during hyperinflation as the local currency devalues rapidly. This allows you to bypass banks and capital controls, but the problem remains for the rest of citizenship and how they can get bitcoin without having to trade their worthless fiat into something else just to get bitcoin.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Ukraine’s government issued a warning against cryptocurrencies back in November, 2014. However, this has not disrupted the operations of Bitcoin businesses in the country. “The announcement does not affect my business in any way,” Chobanian told CoinTelegraph back in November. “This is a simple runaround. Based on the contents, it’s clear that the NBU (National Bank of Urkaine) does not understanding the situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, the price on LocalBitcoins in Ukraine has reach an asking price of as high as ~US$413.65 (10,947.19 UAH) per bitcoin - nearly double the market price – pointing to considerable demand for the cryptocurrency, which may also be partially responsible for the latest price increase.\n\nThus, a real opportunity exists for both cryptocurrency and Ukraine’s citizens who are trying to dump worthless fiat that no one wants in exchange for bitcoin.\n\nAnd while friction undoubtedly exists, this may be a perfect time not only for cryptocurrency to flex its muscles in the embattled country, but also for Bitcoin businesses and exchanges like Kuna Bitcoin agency, who may offer the only viable option to retain people’s savings.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The company has partnered with several companies including mobile security firm Trustonic, identity computing solutions provider Intercede and BitPay.\n\nThe app will be available to users in the second quarter of this year, and according to Rivetz CEO Steven Sprague the project has garnered interest from several wallet providers including Mycelium and Breadwallet.\n\nSprague said that bitcoin\'s use as a mobile payment instrument has greater ramifications for the broader development of trusted computing and the Internet of Things. The company recently demoed its software solution at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\n\nThe question of how bitcoin users protect the all-important private key is an old one. In a recent interview he said:\n\n""Bitcoin has a huge challenge, which is how do I protect the private key? Trusted computing has spent $5bn on how do you protect the private key.""\n\nSecuring mobile bitcoin\n\nRivetz\'s software acts as a second layer of security built into the phone itself. The app makes use of the Trustonic Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) – a hardware-isolated security platform built into millions of ARM-based Android devices – to protect users\' bitcoin data and application integrity.\n\nThe app uses a Trusted User Interface (TUI) for secure PIN entry and display of the users\' transaction details. The trusted UI allows the information to be securely configured by the end user and securely controlled by the TEE environment, by verifying the user interface of a mobile device.\n\nWhen a user makes a transaction, a summary of the transaction is displayed in a new window by the TEE, ensuring that any non-secure applications stored in the rich OS environment cannot tamper with the payment details.\n\nAs a user experience, Rivetz presents another authorization layer on top of the steps included in whatever bitcoin wallet is being used. The user can review the address, amount and transaction fee prior to signing the transaction.\n\nAdvancing payments\n\nSprague told CoinDesk that the goal of Rivetz was to appeal to a wide audience of bitcoin users by supporting a full range of wallet partners.\n\n""The technology will also support multi-sig and hierarchical-deterministic wallets in the near future,"" he added.\n\nSprague argued that bitcoin as a technology has the potential to reshape how people pay using trusted devices, as well as solve problems that have existed in the digital payments space for years.\n\n""Hacking money is a really, really, really well-refined science,"" he said. ""It’s not just being developed because bitcoin started. Hackers have been stealing money for a long time.""\n\nThe Internet of trust\n\nThe idea of securing transactions extends beyond the payment of money, said Sprague, noting that trust plays a central role in the concept of the Internet of Things.\n\nCompanies like IBM have drawn from the example of a smart house filled with interconnected appliances when describing how the bitcoin protocol could be used to facilitate device-to-device communication.\n\nAccording to Sprague, homeowners who use their mobiles device to instruct their smart appliances will need the means to make sure that those appliances are receiving transactions from the proper source, noting:\n\n""How do I assure that the washing machine is authorized? What if it’s a rogue operator taking over a machine, or some guy who wants to trade soap futures and wants a million washing machines to order too much soap?""\n\nIf and when devices come to be used as security mechanisms for the home, Sprague added, owners need a means to identify themselves securely.\n\n""It\'s not just about access,"" he said.\n\nYessi Bello Perez contributed reporting.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

03/04/2015,"['Until now, Colombians have had to rely on foreign services and exchanges in order to buy and sell Bitcoins. The problematic nature of this was illustrated best by the failure of Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox many moons ago. Regardless of whether you trust a foreign exchange are not, in the event that you lose your money, your options for recuperation are limited.\n\nEnter CriptoBanco, a trading platform launched by Merkabahnk with the help of Mimetic Markets. It has a wallet hosted by the world leader in cryptocurrency security, BitGo, who, as we recently reported, now offers the additional security of insurance to its clients in the unlikely event of catastrophic failure.\n\nCriptoBanco believes that the world banking cartels and government monopolies on money are due largely to a lack of options at the consumer level. To this end, a recent post on their website reads:\n\nWorld governments need not have the monopoly of violence to establish a monopoly over money, that monopoly money is given voluntarily to them by the “citizens” under his rule. It is because of that modern tacit assumption, that there should be no more than a single dominant currency in each country, and that currencies should be only controlled by governments. Citizens automatically assume that their governments should monopolize the supply of money, and cede this power willingly, without being blackmailed by the threat of violence. Once the government has control over the money, then you can set monopolistic control over violence. To create money, to run deficits, and armies are built to repress the people if they disagree.\n\nTrading at CriptoBanco\n\nRegistration is smooth and fast – enter your e-mail address and a password, and you’re already near done. To use the platform, you’ll have to give up the usual details, similar to what you must do at CoinBase or any of the other firms commonly accepted as legitimate. This is seen as important for the security of the other users as much as it is a way of staying friendly with governments and not getting quickly shut down.\n\nCriptoBanco was able to get off the ground quickly, and this had a lot to do with its using software licensed from trusted professionals, as well as not trying to re-invent the wheel as far as its wallet software went. Said Will O’Brien, CEO of wallet provider BitGo:\n\n“Today represents the first time a Bitcoin enterprise has launched using only off the shelf APIs for its primary operating infrastructure and security. The speed with which CriptoBanco was able to launch operations under the protection of world-class security is a game-changing event in both established markets as well as markets struggling with a lack of financial infrastructure.”\n\nCriptoBanco also believes that simply creating cyrptocurrency versions of traditional financial products would not fully capitalize on the power of Bitcoin, a refreshing stance on their role, indeed. To this end, they say:\n\nThe CriptoBanco platform allows anyone to become an economic actor, where they can establish and transfer property rights, especially as they acquire entrepreneurial tools and skills and eventually become business owners. To get from here to the future, they will cater services that are not simply bitcoin versions of existing financial products, but are disruptive systems that solve problems that could not be solved until the advent of Blockchain Technology.\n\nWith the ease of setting up an exchange created by companies like Mimetic Markets, more exchanges will in the future be popping up everywhere, serving niche needs and covering under-served, “under-banked” areas. Bitcoin exchanges will become a many-headed hydra rather than a centralized beast, easily brought under control of this or that local government.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""While Australia holds off on removing the double taxation of digital currencies, researchers have said that they could in fact replace cash altogether in the country – in as little as 10 years.\n\n‘AusBit’\n\nWhile Australian Treasury Department representative Kate Preston went on record Wednesday to say that it has “no issues with the way that the ATO has dealt with [digital currency],” researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) have concluded that it “will have to be addressed by federal government” and that Australia could be a cashless society within the next decade.\n\nSpeaking to ABC News, Professor Rabee Tourky said that government treatment reform was necessary “if it wants to maintain control over the financial side of the economy.”\n\n“I'm sure the Reserve Bank of Australia is thinking about these things,” he added, on the back of a study which found that a state-sponsored digital currency would alleviate the concerns around currencies such as bitcoin while allowing the public to take full advantage of the advances offered by paperless money.\n\nAusBit, the name given to this interim currency by Tourky, is similar in nature to possible systems suggested by the European Central Bank this week, but with a more emphatic Bitcoin link. Tourky commented to Vine:\n\n“In 10 years’ time there won’t be any paper cash. The big question is what’s going to replace it in Australia? Will it be Bitcoin? I don’t think so. More likely it will be ‘AusBit’[…].”\n\n‘Taxed appropriately’\n\nTourky’s buoyant remarks do not echo those made by lawmakers to Wednesday’s Economic Reference Committee hearing. The director of the Attorney-General's Financial Crime Section, Daniel Mossop, urged caution with regard to Bitcoin-esque digital currencies, citing its “attractiveness” for criminals and the difficulty of tracking transactions.\n\n“They can cross borders, and payments can be made directly to people anywhere in the world. We can see who's buying [bitcoins] and who's selling them, to a large extent, but we lose visibility of what happens within the system,” he said.\n\nPreston meanwhile kept to the tax agenda, stating that “[t]he Treasury view would be that, taxation is not where you start.” However, some unlikely support came in from Brett Peterson of the ATO's Tax Council Network, who told the hearing that “if another country unilaterally adopted bitcoin as its official fiat currency, then it could be treated locally as foreign currency, and taxed appropriately,” ZDNet reports.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

(http://zaif.jp/) Already the world\'s largest Monacoin exchange, Zaif now has the potential to become the largest crypto currency exchange in Japan.\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150304/179480\n\n""Crypto currencies are the key to a worldwide financial revolution that is taking place right now,"" said Kazutaka Muraguchi, general partner of NTVP. ""Tech Bureau could become the hub that connects Japan to the global crypto currency market.""\n\nWhen compared with other countries, Japan has been slow to adopt crypto currencies such as Bitcoin. Tech Bureau\'s CEO, Takao Asayama, intends to change this with Zaif\'s expanded services. Zaif now allows people to trade the Japanese yen, Bitcoin, and Monacoin, which is Japan\'s largest crypto currency. ""In Japan, no one talks about Bitcoin 2.0, and people have little interest in owning bitcoins themselves,"" said Asayama. ""Unfortunately, the first newsworthy event related to Bitcoin in Japan was the collapse of Mt. Gox, which has fueled a lot of negative coverage in the media.""\n\nUntil public perception of Bitcoin changes, Tech Bureau plans to leverage notable local crypto currencies such as Monacoin in an effort to ultimately accelerate Bitcoin adoption in Japan. ""By providing the most user-friendly crypto currency exchange on the market, we are creating an environment that encourages Japanese people to increasingly rely on crypto currencies in the future,"" said Asayama.\n\nMonacoin\'s recent trading activity shows promising signs for crypto currencies in Japan. Since Jan. 2015, Monacoin\'s market cap has increased 750 percent, reaching a value of around $2.5 million. According to Asayama, it\'s reminiscent of what happened with Bitcoin in 2011 and 2012. Tech Bureau\'s ultimate goal, however, is to use any boom in local crypto currencies to steer Japan toward more widespread acceptance of Bitcoin. By doing so, Asayama hopes to turn Zaif into the country\'s largest Bitcoin exchange and align Japan with the worldwide trend toward Bitcoin usage.\n\nThere are currently less than 100 retailers that accept bitcoins in Japan. ""Although we have several Bitcoin payment processors here, there are no real incentives for retailers to accept bitcoins,"" said Asayama. ""Before we get more retailers on board, we first need to increase the number of Japanese people who are willing to own and use Bitcoin.""\n\nAbout Tech Bureau Inc. and Zaif Exchange\n\nIn July 2014, Tech Bureau launched a Bitcoin wallet called Zaif. Although it was intended to be an experimental project, Zaif wallet gained 2,000 users in the first 48 hours and 1,500 additional users by the end of the first month.\n\nAfter acquiring Japan\'s first Bitcoin exchange, Etwings, Tech Bureau made significant improvements and relaunched the service as part of the Zaif exchange on March 5, 2015. To spur quick growth, the company has waived trading fees for the time being. Tech Bureau plans to launch an English version of its service very soon.\n\nhttp://zaif.jp/\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nTakao Asayama\n\nEmail\n\n+14086277755\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tech-bureau-inc-raises-835000-launches-major-bitcoin-exchange-in-japan-300045280.html\n\nSOURCE Tech Bureau, Inc.\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://zaif.jp\n\n', 'Online privacy company Abine has announced the launch of Bitcoin Anywhere, enabling Coinbase wallet holders to make bitcoin purchases at any e-commerce site.\n\nBitcoin Anywhere, currently in beta and invite only, will enable Coinbase users to link their wallet to Abine Blur, a password control service.\n\nWhen they want to make a purchase, consumers create a privacy-enhancing \'Masked Card\', which work in a similar way to pre-paid gift vouchers.

In contrast, if a bad actor has access to the bitcoin network, they have no power in the network itself and they do not compromise trust in the network.""\n\nHe added:\n\n""Contrary to popular misconception, bitcoin is not unregulated.

It said it was unable to account for some 850,000 bitcoins, worth nearly half a billion dollars at the time. It was a staggering sum, possibly purloined by hackers who exploited a bug in the bitcoin system, according to the company.\n\nThe size of the supposed heist, and its dollar value, shrank considerably last year. Some 200,000 coins turned up in an old-format bitcoin wallet last March, bringing the tally to 650,000. At the current bitcoin price of $277, which is about half of what it was a year ago, the missing coins are worth about $180 million.\n\nBut there’s still no explanation of what happened to them, and no clear record of what happened on the exchange. An anonymous report last year by a bitcoin researcher, based on leaked trading logs, chronicles the activities of trading bots that apparently ran amuck in the MtGox system, indicating massive fraudulent trading.\n\nTokyo-based bitcoin security firm WizSec issued a report last month that supports some of the findings of the anonymous study, concluding that a bot dubbed Willy operated over several trading accounts and was able to trade at times when the exchange was not available to other users. But the WizSec report, which was cautious about not jeopardizing other investigations, said more study of Willy is needed to understand its purpose.\n\nTim Hornyak\n\nMtGox CEO Mark Karpeles, who bowed in ritual apology during his bankruptcy news conference at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, maintains that online thieves are to blame. He has also hinted that they may have had insider help.\n\nIn January, Japan’s Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, citing sources close to a Tokyo police probe of the MtGox collapse, reported that only 7,000 of the coins appear to have been taken by hackers, with the remainder stolen through a series of fraudulent transactions.\n\nKarpeles said he is “mostly kept in the dark” about the ongoing police investigation and couldn’t comment on it.\n\n“I really hope we will see some kind of progress—if possible by catching the hackers and whoever might have been helping them,” Karpeles said via email. “This whole thing has been impacting a lot of people, and continuing to impact them for way too long.”\n\nObservers had doubted that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police had the resources or know-how to track the coins, and it was not surprising that last November, Bitcoin exchange Kraken was enlisted to help investigate the missing bitcoins as part of the liquidation of MtGox.\n\n“Kraken is helping with the claims process, including evaluating the assets owed to creditors and assisting in the investigation of MtGoxs collapse,” Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said via email, adding that he had no new information about what Kraken has done in the case over the past three months.\n\nA Swiss study last year cast doubt on the theory floated by MtGox that a large volume of bitcoins could have been stolen from the exchange using so-called transaction malleability attacks.\n\nAnother key person who would be best informed about the investigation and the whereabouts of the coins is also keeping mum. Lawyer Nobuaki Kobayashi, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the liquidation of MtGox, refused a request for more information, saying he won’t discuss the matter with news media. Kobayashi has also enlisted accounting firms to aid the investigation and has said missing customer transaction data is impeding progress.\n\nMark Karpeles, the former head of failed Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, still has plans for the digital currency.\n\nKobayashi’s periodic updates on the MtGox website and meetings to inform former MtGox customers who lost bitcoin in the fiasco haven’t been well received by some investors. Former MtGox protestor Kolin Burges described the November creditors’ meeting on his blog thus: “Secrecy is sprinkled over everything like an artificial sweetener to hide things we’re not going to like, cover up poor progress, avoid answering awkward questions, etc.”\n\nCreditors are still waiting for Kobayashi to launch a process to receive claims related to lost coins. Their next meeting is April 22.\n\nBitcoin itself was also massively affected by the MtGox collapse, and while the digital currency is a shadow of its former self in terms of price, it has seen increased moves toward mainstream acceptance.\n\n“Although Gox certainly had a negative impact on bitcoin’s brand in the short-term, the tech and currency have never been healthier,” bitcoin journalist Ryan Selkis, who posted the leaked “Crisis Strategy Draft” document that outlined the missing bitcoins days before MtGox went bust, said via email.\n\n“International exchange infrastructure, security solutions, and regulatory frameworks have all progressed dramatically—basics you need to have in place before killer apps like remittances and enterprise-grade e-commerce are even possible.”\n\nAs for Karpeles, he lost another company to bankruptcy in January—this time MtGox parent firm Tibanne. Following a dispute with Kobayashi about money that Tibanne had apparently borrowed from the bitcoin exchange, the Tokyo District Court approved bankruptcy proceedings for Tibanne, a small Web hosting and services provider.\n\nThe Tibanne website is now offline.', ""MegaBigPower has announced that it will begin purchasing preowned bitcoin mining ASICs as part of a plan to acquire as much as 10 megawatts worth of hardware.\n\nUnder the buyback program, the US-based bitcoin mining company will purchase certain types of hardware, with an emphasis on models sold by mining manufacturers Spondoolies-Tech and Bitmain.\n\nFounder Dave Carlson framed the program as a simpler alternative for miners looking to sell their equipment online, telling CoinDesk:\n\n“Due to our extremely low power cost, we can still return funds to miners who may have gotten in just before the market fell.

He added that he hoped the program would enable some former miners the chance to recoup losses they may have experienced as the price of bitcoin fell and profitability dwindled as a result.\n\n“I'm hoping this program will keep enthusiasts and investors involved with bitcoin on a positive note and not leave them feeling burned,” said Carlson.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Barhydt previously founded mobile banking startup Boom Financial, which raised $17m in 2012, and WebSentric, one of the first online meeting services.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Barhydt explained that the goal of Abra is to attack the $550bn global remittance market by reducing its associated fees.

The first sale in July included 30,000 Bitcoins which were snapped up by Tim Draper , who is often credited with coining the term ‘viral marketing’.\n\nAt the time of writing the price of a single Bitcoin was $645, putting an open market valuation of 30,000 coins at around $19,350,000 (£11.2m). A second sale of 50,000 coins took place in December .\n\nThe auctions are intended to be anonymous, but a leaked list of bidders in a previous sale revealed that interested parties included professors, staff from various investment funds and banks and the co-founder of a Bitcoin-related startup.\n\nSilk Road was launched in February 2011 and is sometimes called the “Amazon.com of illegal drugs”.\n\nIt used the anonymising tool Tor to protect the identity of buyers, sellers and the site’s administrators.

The main reason is that Bitcoin is very volatile as a currency. The price at any given moment can be significantly different from what it was just a moment before. Fortunately, there are tools for checking out the current Bitcoin exchange rate and the charts to provide an outlook on Bitcoin exchange rate history.\n\nWhat determines Bitcoin value\n\nFor Bitcoin to function as currency, there has to be some value behind it. While the gold’s value is determined by its use in industry, Bitcoin is nothing more than bits on one’s computer. However, these bits have been highly valued for some time already. The current price of Bitcoin is the proof.\n\nGenerally, there are two main factors that affect the value of Bitcoin at a given moment. They are media events and (supply and) demand.\n\nThe role of demand\n\nThe supply part of the supply-demand duo has been put in brackets, as the absolute Bitcoin’s supply is predetermined and limited. Only 21 million coins will be issued in the crypto’s lifetime. According to the creator Satoshi Nakamoto’s plan, In 2140, all of them will be mined. Such a limitation is a nice stimulus for enthusiasts to buy a Bitcoin and become ‘one in 21 million’. The “rare equals valuable” rule applies here quite well.\n\nThe role of media coverage\n\nThen, media coverage helps Bitcoin a lot. While the cryptocurrency community is not that numerous yet, Bitcoin-related news help raise awareness about the digital currency and its benefits. First of all, the demand gets stronger as more people are willing to try the new technology. They see that this ‘magic Internet money’ can be used as the payment for products and services that they know of (take AirBaltic, Overstock, or Microsoft), and they become convinced in its real value. Secondly, they see the approval of cryptocurrencies from the big market players and big media names. If you look at any Bitcoin exchange rate chart and define the main turning points, you will see that more coverage means more awareness and higher demand, which mean greater value and higher price.\n\nBitcoin value and Bitcoin price\n\nIn simple words, Bitcoin’s value refers to what it’s worth as believed by people who use it. Being valuable, however, means little in the context of today’s global economy. People need a number to operate. Thus, the price is created. Partially, this price is related to Bitcoin being an asset or commodity – meaning that one can buy it for a certain amount of something.\n\nCurrent Bitcoin exchange rate\n\nBitcoin’s price seems like something absolutely unpredictable. It can rise or drop dozens of dollars in some 10 minutes (average time it takes for a block to be created). For example, the day’s difference on March 4th was $15, which is not that much. At the moment of writing, Bitcoin is priced at approximately $280. As the exchange rate grows, it gets valued more. And this current price follows a relatively long period of stability at $230 and around it. You can always stay updated on the current Bitcoin price by checking out CEX.IO Bitcoin calculator. It will also show you the amount of crypto you will get for a particular sum in fiat currency. If you want to follow the price variations of this extremely volatile entity, Bitcoin price charts come handy.\n\nBitcoin exchange rate chart\n\nTrading pages on many exchanges have charts that show the Bitcoin price changing over a certain period of time. If you are lost and confused when looking at a price chart on CEX.IO, you might find this recent article quite useful.\n\nOne of the great ways to stay updated on all Bitcoin price changes is via installing a mobile app. For example, ZeroBlock from Blockchain.info provides a customisable Bitcoin exchange rate chart where you can watch the price changes over time. The periods to choose from are 24 hours, a week, a month, and a year. It also shows the most current price, which allows you being aware of the latest deal.\n\nWhen looking on such Bitcoin price charts, you might want to compare current Bitcoin exchange rate with the one that was at some point in the past.\n\nBitcoin exchange rate history\n\nThe history of Bitcoin’s price is an impressive sight to look at. If you remember the famous Bitcoin price bubble, which burst after the currency reached over $1,000, then you surely know what we mean. If you don’t, then you might find the old charts and look at them. Blockchain.info provides such an opportunity to view the Bitcoin exchange rate history from the price not exceeding $1 till the spring of 2011.\n\nPredicting Bitcoin price\n\nWhile there is no way to know what the Bitcoin’s exchange rate will be for sure, you might make guesses based on the abovementioned charts and also by following the cryptocurrency-related news.\n\nAlso, here is some information on how to apply your chart-reading skills to price prediction. You might consider it as your introduction to technical analysis. Apart from the general usefulness of such knowledge, making prognoses will help you as a Bitcoin trader.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin is a relatively new phenomenon with its wonders and challenges. While it may be regarded as a great payment system and revolutionary technology, its volatile price can drive just anybody crazy. On the other hand, such a volatility can be also explained by the simple supply-and-demand duo, as well as the general opinion of Bitcoin and attention to it.\n\nWhile the price difference on the same day may reach dozens of US dollars, there are tools to keep track of all those changes. They (for example, charts) can also help predict the direction in which the Bitcoin exchange rate will move in the future.', 'Japanese startup Tech Bureau Inc. launches a new cryptocurrency exchange, dubbed Zaif exchange, supporting Bitcoin as well as the ""Japanese Dogecoin,"" Monacoin, in a bid to become ""the hub that connects Japan to the global cryptocurrency market.""\n\nBacked by US$835,000 in funding from Nippon Technology Venture Partners, a Japanese venture capital firm that focuses on early-stage investing for startups, Tech Bureau Inc. acquired local digital currency exchange Etwings, and relaunched the service yesterday, after making significant improvements in its platform, including the addition of multi-signature features and cold storage.\n\nMt. Gox\'s collapse over a year ago had left nothing but a negative image of cryptocurrencies in people\'s mind, leading Japan to experience a rather slow pace of adoption.\n\nAccording to Tech Bureau Inc. CEO Takao Asayama:\n\n""In Japan, no one talks about Bitcoin 2.0, and people have little interest in owning bitcoins themselves. Unfortunately, the first newsworthy event related to Bitcoin in Japan was the collapse of Mt. Gox, which has fueled a lot of negative coverage in the media.""\n\nAsayama said he is determined to change this trend and is looking to accelerate Bitcoin adoption in the country ""by providing the most user-friendly cryptocurrency exchange on the market.""\n\n""We are creating an environment that encourages Japanese people to increasingly rely on crypto currencies in the future.""\n\nAlthough Japan has several bitcoin payment processors, there are currently less than 100 retailers that accept bitcoin in the country. ""There are no incentives for retailers to accept bitcoins,"" he noted. ""Before we get more retailers on board, we first need to increase the number of Japanese people who are willing to own and use Bitcoin.""\n\nTech Bureau Inc. further stated it was looking to leverage ""any boom in local cryptocurrencies"" and in the altcoin sphere, as it believes it will ""steer Japan toward more widespread acceptance of Bitcoin.""\n\nAs of today, the company has got its hands on the cat meme-based cryptocurrency Monacoin that Japan had fallen in love with, and is determined to surf on the trend.\n\n""Monacoin\'s recent trading activity shows promising signs for crypto currencies in Japan,"" the company stated, and according to Asayama, it\'s reminiscent of what happened with Bitcoin in 2011 and 2012.\n\nIntroduced in the summer 2014, Monacoin is currently ranked at the 14th place with a market capitalization of US$3.8m, or 1/3 of Dogecoin\'s market cap. According to Coinmarketcap, it is estimated that 90% of its user base is based in Japan, with a few businesses already accepting the cryptocurrency as a payment method.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

What is the compelling use case that will cause millions to adopt bitcoin, knowingly or unknowingly? It just might be Abra.\n\nAnnounced on the final day of Launch Festival 2015, Abra is a company that is looking to take a slice of the $550 billion global remittance market. With legacy companies such as Western Union charging 10 percent and more to remit money internationally, Abra offers the potential for instantaneous money transfers at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAt the event, CEO Bill Barhydt said: “Our mission with Abra is to turn every smartphone into a teller that processes withdrawals. This is not just another bitcoin app. The wallet is a full-fledged digital asset management system, and you don’t have to understand it.”\n\nUse of the application is straightforward and relies on a network of people around the world who act as tellers, charging small fees to help people transfer money abroad. A user can deposit funds into his or her account using a debit card or by meeting up with a teller in person and handing them cash. Then those funds can be instantly — the power of Bitcoin — transferred anywhere in the world. The person receiving the money has only to find a teller, show that he or she is the recipient of the funds, and exchange the digital cash (denominated in USD) back for their local currency.\n\n“The teller charges a fee. We take 50 basis points on either side. If the teller doesn’t charge a fee, we don’t charge a fee,” Barhydt explained at the event.\n\nFurther, there is no foreign-exchange risk. Once the money is in the account, it holds that value for the first three days guaranteed. This ensures that if someone wants to send $200, all $200 can get to the intended person.\n\nThe killer application\n\nWhat gives it the potential title of “killer app” is the fact that Abra is powered by Bitcoin, but the user has no idea that Bitcoin is what is powering it.\n\nIt’s been said numerous times, but how the network works is less important to someone than whether it works. The average individual doesn’t want to know how the pipes work; they want to know that water is going to come out. The same is true for finance.\n\nAt the “Bitcoin and the Future of Payments Technology” Fireside Chat held at the Museum of American Finance back in February, the panel talked about how people don’t know how the Internet works, but know that if they hit “send” on an email, it’ll get to where it needs to go. No one knows about any of the protocols making that possible.\n\n“Bitcoin will be the same way,” said Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle.\n\nThe average person using this application won’t need to know that it’s Bitcoin powering the backend either. All users need to know is that their money transferred in minutes and that the fees are significantly less than what they would pay using a service like Western Union.', 'There\'s no shortage of theories as to why Brazil has yet to become a hotbed of bitcoin adoption in Latin America.\n\nPopular ideas include everything from the language barrier (limited access to Portuguese bitcoin resources) to past incidents with exchanges (the mystery surrounding Bitcoin Rain). However, the most likely culprit may be a lack of fundamentals in its market, according to one entrepreneur.\n\n""The problem with liquidity in Brazil is we have natural buyers, we have people who want to trade, but we don\'t have natural sellers,"" explains Marcelo Miranda, a nine-year Deutsche Bank veteran who is launching a local bitcoin exchange, FlowBTC, on 6th March.\n\nMiranda told CoinDesk:\n\n""We don\'t have mining, we don\'t have a lot of merchants – these are natural sellers and hedgers.""\n\nTo alleviate these problems, Miranda has struck a partnership with bitcoin exchange software provider AlphaPoint that will connect FlowBTC to other exchanges around the world, including Canada\'s Cointrader and Mexico\'s meXBT.\n\nAlphaPoint CEO Vadim Telyatnikov characterized the development as a positive one given Miranda\'s background, and what he suggested was the untapped potential of Brazil\'s market.\n\n""We believe his expertise and experience trading securities, including on Deutsche Bank\'s equity desk, will incentivize trading professionals to become more engaged in Latin America\'s digital currency space,"" Telyatnikov said.\n\nEarly interest\n\nMiranda indicated that his interest in bitcoin began while he was working with Deutsche Bank, seeing it as an evolution of the growing influence of technology on trading activities.\n\n""Trading in all markets became very high tech, so it was natural to me to look for something that was at the forefront of technology and trading, and for me bitcoin and digital currency was a perfect fit,"" he explained.\n\nThe interest lead him to eventually part ways with the German bank. ""They were restructuring and there was an opportunity to move on,"" he said.\n\nFrom there, he built IXBTC, a pricing index for the local market that launched last October, and began thinking of ways to bring his expertise more fully to the market.\n\n""I started to realize, there was a lack of a professional grade exchange in Brazil,"" Miranda said. ""I think there was a big lack of an anchor exchange, some platform that institutional investors could relate to.""\n\n""That was the whole idea behind FlowBTC,"" he added, noting the team now includes five employees.\n\nMiranda suggested that his former colleagues have been largely supportive of the move.\n\n""It\'s not that they think it\'s something dumb or silly. I think that most of them can see the bright side of bitcoin and digital currency in general, I think they lack knowledge,"" he said.\n\nFocus on products\n\nTapping into this larger source of liquidity, Miranda said, will be just one of the competitive advantages for his endeavor.\n\nFlowBTC aims to also focus on products, including a research report with market intelligence aimed at FX and equities traders.\n\nMiranda indicated that FlowBTC considers itself a FinTech company, and that it plans to expand into payments more fully soon, entering a market served by competitors such as BitInvest, which has the highest-profile merchant partnership in Brazil to date.\n\nStill, FlowBTC plans to evolve differently, citing more widely known institutional bitcoin platforms as companies with similar models.\n\n""At some moment, when the Latin American market is mature enough, our idea is to become something closer to Coinsetter or LedgerX,"" he added.\n\nSao Paulo image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The researchers did not perform the analysis for 2014.\n\nMiners\' hasty transfers in recent years contrasts sharply with the behaviour of early miners. In 2009, 66% of miners left their rewards untouched. Those who did make a transaction did so about four months after obtaining the reward.\n\nThe following year the share of ""frozen miners"" fell to 20%. By contrast, in 2011 just 2% of miners didn\'t perform a transaction with their mined rewards.\n\nEarly miners locked out\n\nThe paper suggests that one reason early miners haven\'t moved their bitcoins is because they have lost access to those wallets, locking them out permanently. These early miners probably got involved in bitcoin not for financial gain, but because it was a ""fun technology"" that could be played with casually, the authors write.\n\n""When bitcoin became valuable, they might have, unfortunately, lost their [access] so they couldn\'t cash out! This suggests that lots of bitcoins mined in the first two years might have been lost permanently!""\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, the bitcoin price exploded, from several cents a coin to $1,128 at its height in December 2013. This price surge was accompanied by a rise in the number of miners joining the bitcoin network. As the number of miners grew, miners went from going ""solo"" to joining pools, in order to share their computational power while maintaining their chances of capturing a reward.\n\n""Computation power [was] evenly distributed among miners at the early stage, then became highly skewed with a small number of very powerful miners as the bitcoin network evolved ... those top miners are indeed mining pools.""\n\nThe authors analysed miners\' profitability as the bitcoin price rose over the years. They then looked at two pieces of mining hardware – a Radeon graphics card and a Butterfly Labs ASIC miner – and compared their performance to the bitcoin price and network difficulty in 2011 and 2013.\n\nThe paper will be presented at the Passive and Active Measurements Conference, which discusses network measurement and analysis techniques, in New York on 19th March.\n\nDiscus Fish surge\n\nWang and Liu found that the early miner with the graphics card, if paying the average United States electricity price, broke even on their investment in just under two years. The owner of the ASIC miner, however, could have broken even in less than a month, if the hardware was purchased in July 2013. Profits would have continued to accumulate well into the following March, where the researchers\' analysis stops.\n\nThe pair also dig into the mechanics of the Discus Fish mining pool, which consistently had the biggest chunk of the network hashrate in the second half of last year, a title it recently ceded to Antpool.\n\nDiscus Fish, which also goes by F2Pool, saw a surge in the number of miners in its pool at the end of 2013, the authors find. The figure rose from a few hundred miners in October to 5,000 just five months later.\n\nAn analysis of the distribution of rewards within the Discus Fish pool is able to estimate the hashrate of the top 10% of miners within the pool compared to the pool averages. The top 10% of miners in Discus Fish have a hashrate that is about a thousand times greater than the pool average, the paper found.\n\nSince the pool employs a \'pay per share\' model, miners are rewarded in direct proportion to the number of shares, or computational power, they contribute to a pool. Therefore, the authors conclude, the most powerful miners in a pool also reap most of the rewards.\n\nAn independent analyst of mining pools, who goes by the pseudonym Organ of Corti, said the paper had implemented a method to quantify the average hashrate of individual miners within a pool for the first time.\n\n""They implemented a method to determine a miner\'s average hashrate by monitoring F2Pool\'s output transactions,"" the analyst said. ""It\'s not a new idea, but it\'s the first time I\'ve seen it done.""\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Winklevoss twins—who are serious Bitcoin enthusiasts— recently put their money behind online auction site Paddle 8, that would allow for cryptocurrencies to be accepted, and artist Sarah Meyohas has even created an alternative cryptocurrency called Bitchcoin, a speculative investment backed by the market value of her art by square inch. And what a natural fit for selling art: Bitcoin can send money anywhere the Internet reaches in enormous sums, often without the ability to trace where it’s coming from or going to.\n\nSo we decided to ask the exhibitors at the Armory Show this week—where startup Artsy has bought up a huge presence—if any of them had actually used Bitcoin as a method of transaction.\n\n“Never, ever,” said João Paulo Siqueira Lopes, Associate Director at Lisson Gallery. “Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.”\n\nOne artist has created a digital currency called “Bitchcoin,” a currency backed by the value of her artwork. Here’s how it works.\n\nIt was this kind of stark reaction from everyone asked. Usually a look of surprise, a bewildered smile, and absolutely no memory of any Bitcoin transactions.\n\n“Is that still a thing, Bitcoin?” Christine McMonagle, Director at Sean Kelly Gallery, told the Observer. “We haven’t used it as far as I know, but I’d have to ask.”\n\nWe sent her to check with her colleagues if anyone had made a purchase with Bitcoin. She returned quickly, and confirmed that no one had ever brought up the subject.\n\n“Did the person you ask laugh?” we asked her.\n\n“Yes,” Ms. McMonagle said.\n\nWell, maybe it was just those galleries—it was an enormous show, and you can’t have a few dozen presenters speak for an entire industry. So we asked Ben Hartley, International Managing Director of another online auction platform, Auctionata, if he’d ever witnessed a major exchange of art for Bitcoin.\n\n“We deal with about 100 countries, and in our two and a half years of existence, it’s never even come up,” Mr. Hartley told the Observer.\n\nWe chalked it up to the stuffiness of more classic galleries, and stalked out the booth for Upstream Gallery, which had come from Amsterdam to present a series of net art installations by Rafaël Rozendaal. Surely if anyone is at the edge of technology and art, it’s the exhibitor selling artwork that comes with a contract imposing domain hosting responsibilities. Still no luck.\n\n“No matter how forward or contemporary the art is, the market is still quite conservative,” Upstream’s Martijn Dijkstra told us.\n\nStill, perhaps the biggest opportunity for Bitcoin adaption is international exchange. Shouldn’t the geographically diverse collecting business flock to such a rapid, liquid form of exchange? No way—according to Mr. Dijkstra, Bitcoin is relatively unknown in Europe, to say nothing of the European art scene.\n\nAlright, so nobody is asking about Bitcoin in the art world. What about, say, if a wealthy collector wanted to make a sizable purchase in Bitcoin?\n\n“We wouldn’t sell to them, especially if we don’t know or trust them,” said Jessica Fredericks of Fredericks & Freiser. “We just don’t know how Bitcoin works.”\n\nSurely, this was just a show by wealthy gallerists uninterested in breaking with the pack and looking like fools in front of an enterprising journalist. So, we decided to pose as collectors—recent tech founders who just successfully exited, and were looking to spruce up a loft in Dumbo in advance of a new product launch. We spent some time convincing a few dealers we were seriously interested in closing about $40,000 in small works. And then, we broke the news. See, we have a wealthy VC who has a lot of stake in the cryptocurrency space, and we don’t want to make a show of no faith by making any significant transactions that weren’t in Bitcoin.\n\nA staff member from Galeri Non, small gallery from Istanbul showing in the Focus: MENAM section, smiled brightly, took down my information, and told me they’d have to put me in touch with someone on the business side.\n\n“I’m sure something can be done,” we were told. We haven’t heard back.']"
03/06/2015,"['What is Epic Scale, is it being installed silently and should you be concerned?\n\nEarlier today we broke a news story that discussed accusations against BitTorrent client uTorrent.\n\nuTorrent users claimed the software’s latest update was being bundled with a Bitcoin mining program called Epic Scale. It was alleged that the installation was taking place silently – i.e. users weren’t aware the software was being installed.\n\nUpdate: We’ve also had further tips from users both on Reddit and in our comments sections suggesting that multiple attempts at installing uTorrent result in an omission of the Epic Scale verification page.\n\nBitTorrent Inc., the company that created uTorrent, flatly denied a silent installation was taking place.\n\nWhat is Epic Scale?\n\nEpic Scale, for context, is a piece of software that purports to use your ‘unused processing power to change the world.’ In short, it mines Bitcoin in the background for charitable purposes – although it also claims to help process scientific data.\n\nWe have no reason to suspect it does anything other than what it says, but equally there’s no tangible evidence – other than its word – that Epic Scale does donate to the charities it claims and how much of its revenue it donates if it does.\n\nComments on the internet from what appears to be an Epic Scale team member suggest it is working on ways to show their charitable contributions more clearly on its website and within the software. Its current terms and conditions only refer to a “portion” of revenue going to charities.\n\nWith that cleared up, we decided to test the installation process to see wherein the problem lies.\n\nInstalling uTorrent: Silent install or deceptive design?\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, uTorrent was listing version 3.4.2 build 38913 as available to download. That’s the build we installed.\n\nThe installation went as follows:\n\n1. Download the software. The file size for the Windows version was 1.66MB.\n\n\n\n2. We were then greeted with a browser pop-up that asked us to enter our e-mail for news updates from uTorrent. The checkbox was ticked by default. Nothing unusual here.\n\n\n\n3. The actual installation wizard begins with an intro that briefly explains the software.\n\n\n\n4. The next page warned ‘Beware of online scams!’ and detailed how third-party websites were emulating uTorrent software for nefarious purposes.\n\n\n\n5. The next page was an End User License Agreement. This outlined all of the terms a user agrees to when installing a piece of software. This page had two options: ‘Back’ and ‘I Agree’.\n\n\n\n6. The next page has three checkboxes, all of which are ticked. These options mean you accept that the software will create a Start menu entry, create a Quick Launch icon, and create a Desktop icon.\n\n\n\nSign up for the newsletter Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox Your email address: Sign up\n\n7. The next page has two more checkboxes, all of which are ticked by default. These enable two settings; the first is an exception for uTorrent in Windows Firewall, while the second ensures uTorrent launches every time you start Windows.\n\n\n\n8. The next page details a ‘special offer’ for BitTorrent users, namely in the form of an album download – 700 Fill by Ratking. The checkbox to download this is ticked by default. The next icon glows blue, while the back icon is grey.\n\n\n\n9. The next page refers to Epic Scale, the software in question. There are no checkboxes on this page. There are two options: ‘Accept Offer’ and ‘Decline Offer’. The former glows blue, the latter is grey.\n\n\n\n10. The next page pushes an adware called Wajam onto users. The checkboxes are smaller on this page, and ask whether the user wants to accept the software or not. There is also a ‘Finish’ icon.\n\n\n\n11. Once completed, the software is installed and loads up.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe good thing about all of this is that there were indeed options to decline every single item of bundled software, which gels with BitTorrent’s claims that it wasn’t silently forcing software onto users.\n\nThe Bad\n\nWhere uTorrent falls down in our view, and the views of some of its users, is the clarity of its process. What you have here is an installation wizard that actively makes it difficult for users to avoid installing bundled software.\n\nThe obvious trick is that most users looking to install a piece of software just click through the ‘next’ icons. This especially true for anyone who is in a rush, or is otherwise unaware about the practice of bundling other software as part of installs. Anyone who has ‘debugged’ a relative’s PC will understand how easily this happens.\n\nThe problem is that many of the checkboxes in uTorrent’s installation wizard are selected by default, which means spamming the ‘Next’ button will result in potentially unwanted software installations.\n\nMoreover, Epic Scale didn’t actually have a checkbox. This means that if a user were to be spamming next, it would definitely install Epic Scale, irrespective of any boxes ticked.\n\nWe also feel the option of “Accept” or “Decline” is designed to make users think the installation may be cancelled on selecting “Decline”, thereby making “Accept” a much more favourable option. And even if it’s not designed as such, it is needlessly confusing.\n\nIt must be said, however, that many companies employ these methods, and not just for software. Many of you will recount times you accidentally signed up for an automated e-mail newsletter, a browser toolbar, or an added surcharge for an online purchase. However, the mix of check boxes and Accept/Decline buttons on our build of uTorrent just adds to the confusion.\n\nThe Ugly\n\n\n\nThe ugly aspect of this is that installing Epic Scale is very different to signing up to a newsletter, and here’s why.\n\nUnlike toolbars and newsletters, Epic Scale isn’t a tangible addition to your cyber-life. If you accidentally installed it, you likely would never notice.\n\nThis is because Epic Scale runs in the background, only interacting with your processor. The software basically outsources processing heft to a wide net of users running the program, which is far more demanding on a system than e-mail spam.\n\nThere is clearly something wrong with a company propagating a situation whereby users are inadvertently running software – either through ignorance or deception – that affects the performance of a computer.\n\nMoreover, Epic Scale is the kind of software often referred to as ‘riskware’. This is software that doesn’t pose a threat in and of itself, and we should stress that there’s no evidence that Epic Scale does any harm to your PC, but which could if abused by malware.\n\nThe relatively discreet nature of Epic Scale and its method of installation makes it open to such abuse, which is no doubt why several anti-virus programs, including ESET, Kaspersky, Panda, Sophos, GData, classify Epic Scale as ‘potentially unwanted’ a ‘risk tool’ or similar variations of.\n\nWe can’t help think it would be better if uTorrent designed its installer in such a way as to make it harder for users to accidentally install software like this. Let us know what you think in the comments.', 'Sentiments on bitcoin, the digital currency, vary wildly at the moment. From reporters to venture capitalists to bankers to the general public, opinions run the gamut, from frenzied flag-waving, to cautious curiosity, to sneering skepticism. But you wouldn’t exactly call any of it “grief.”\n\nAnd yet, the Kubler-Ross model, better known as the “five stages of grief,” (denial; anger; bargaining; depression; acceptance) is a rather apt explanation for what is happening with common perceptions of bitcoin right now.\n\nThat’s the analogy Adam Ludwin used in an interview with Fortune last December. Ludwin, CEO of the company Chain, an API that supports bitcoin applications, was asked about the public perceptions of bitcoin, and the divide between developer excitement and mainstream cluelessness. “Most of the world looked at Bitcoin in the last year and kind of scratched their heads,” said Ludwin. “We are still a good year away, in our estimation, from seeing the first production-ready instruments where you can imagine a known financial services company using this. But it’s not 10 years. And when it happens, people will be surprised by how quickly it spreads. You know, it’s like the five stages of grief—people have gone through all five, all in the last 12 months. There was total denial; followed by anger; followed by, ‘Well, we’ll just do it ourselves’ or ‘we don’t need this,’ that was the negotiating; and now they’re coming around, like, ‘Oh, maybe we should understand it.’”\n\nThe very same analogy appears in The Age of Cryptocurrency, a new book published last month by Paul Vigna and Michael Casey. “We expect you’ll go through a sort of Kubler-Ross model of cryptocurrency recognition before this book is over,” the authors write in their introduction. Their own summation of the steps toward bitcoin enlightenment? Disdain (“not even denial, but disdain”); Skepticism (“Enough stories have appeared to convince you that bitcoin is real… But the details don’t add up”); Curiosity (“Okay, it’s digital money, it may work, but what difference is that going to make to regular people?”); Crystallization (“the jaw-drop moment, the lightbulb moment”); and acceptance (“once you see this, there is no way to unsee it”).\n\nEven New York Magazine’s Daily Intelligencer blog, in a post last March, used the “five stages of bitcoin grief” to describe how bitcoin enthusiasts were reacting to the news that bitcoin would now be subject to capital gains tax.\n\nYou could adjust the stages a little bit more and apply the model to the current media coverage of bitcoin. Call it the five stages of bitcoin understanding.\n\n1.) Ignore. This is what most major news outlets did for a long time. Bitcoin first came around back in 2009 (but almost no one wrote about it), and it took until 2011 for some mainstream publications to begin to learn about it. But even then, most stayed far away. It was a technology on the fringes, not for serious discussion.\n\n2.) Dismiss. Once mainstream news outlets—both newspapers and magazines—began to take even a minor interest in bitcoin, they began to write stories, but mostly with negative angles of dismissal. “Here’s a new bitcoin company or piece of bitcoin news that may be interesting, but it means nothing because bitcoin will fail, and here’s why.”\n\n3.) Hedge. This is where most news outlets sit today, still—they’ve come to understand that bitcoin is a burgeoning technology that has interest and investment, and they are covering it a bit more often, but when they do, they are careful to hedge their bets by including the downside of, or skepticism around, any news or investment in the space.\n\n4.) Cover. Now some publications are beginning to have dedicated reporters who, rather than writing one piece here and there, are almost exclusively covering digital currency. Most of these are business publications. And even still, the vast majority of sites covering bitcoin aren’t doing so on a daily basis, because they still aren’t convinced that it merits such close coverage. An exception, in contrast to legacy outlets, is a flood of bitcoin-only news sites: chief among them is Coindesk, but there is also CryptocoinsNews, Bitcoin Magazine, and many others.\n\n5.) Write a book. The ultimate expression of believing that bitcoin is here to stay is to write a book on the digital currency. For the first few years of the technology’s existence, there were no books on the topic, but then came a flood. In 2014, hundreds of books were released on the topic (according to Amazon the number is a staggering 437, but that comes from a simple subject search, and likely includes many outliers). Two digital currency reporters from the Wall Street Journal wrote one. A CNBC contributor wrote one. A CNNMoney reporter wrote one. The list goes on. These are people in the media who not only have come to understand the currency, but have gone so far as to devote a book’s worth of reporting and discussion to it. (To read our interviews with some of these authors, see: “The bitcoin book boom.”)\n\nSimilarly, there is a quote (often attributed to Gandhi) that bitcoin supporters have adopted as their own, after Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss applied the phrase to bitcoin at the Bitcoin Foundation conference in May 2013: “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.”', 'Hong Kong police arrested five suspects on Thursday, March 5 in connection to the MyCoin alleged Bitcoin scam. Authorities are still searching for the directors and shareholders of the investment company involved in the case.\n\nThe arrests follow the sudden bankruptcy of Hong Kong-based Bitcoin trading and investment outfit MyCoin last month, taking with it a possible total of HK$3bn (or US$386.9m at press time), in investors funds.\n\nThe company, which claimed it was serving 3,000 clients that had invested as much as HK$1m (US$129,000) each, had been accused by both clients and lawmakers of operating a pyramid scheme.\n\nOn Thursday, two brothers, aged 34 and 37, and three women, aged from 48 to 55, were arrested for conspiracy to defraud, reported the South China Morning Post.\n\nAccording to a source:\n\n""The three women were accused of collecting money from some of the victims to help them invest in Bitcoin trading between January and December last year. The two male suspects were alleged to have arranged venues to promote the investment.""\n\nThe five suspects were held for questioning last night, but none had been charged.\n\nThe police are still looking for a number of people involved in the case, including ""former and current directors and shareholders of the investment company involved,"" the source stated.\n\nWhile the police refused to name the said ""investment company,"" victims claimed it is Rich Might Investment. They said they were involved in bitcoin trading through Rich Might Investment since January of last year.\n\nIn late 2014, MyCoin reportedly began to prohibit full account withdrawals unless further investors were found. More than 50 users claimed they were unable to withdraw funds from their accounts, amounting to a total loss of HH$75m (US$9.6m).\n\nA police spokesperson stated:\n\n""[The claimants] claimed their accounts were not in operation since December last year. They were unable to make withdrawals from their accounts and could not continue trading. They suspected they had been cheated.""\n\nAccording to Companies Registry records, William Dennis Atwood was operating as director of Rich Micht Investment until November 10, 2014, when he eventually resigned after changing the trading rules in order to stop investors from cashing in all their bitcoins. Antwood then transferred all his shares on the same day to a British Virgin Islands-based company called Fascinating Horizon Overseas.\n\nA woman named Wong Lok-yan replaced Atwood as director, but resigned on January 28, according to the records.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The USMS has not announced the name of the winner of the entire collection of bitcoin but VC Tim Draper has been quietly buying these seized coins for the past year.\n\nThe auction marks the end of one of the oddest US auctions on record. When the Marshals “seized” the coins after the shutdown of the original Silk Road many suggested that the government would keep them or was unsure how to sell them. The first sale, in July 14, drove bitcoin prices from $570 to about $640. The second sale, in December, barely moved the price at all.\n\nIt’s fascinating that the US government sold these at all. I reported that the government was looking to sell the bitcoin in January 2014 and it took six months to begin the auction process. In that time, hackers attempted to figure out just where the BTC came from and went and many even targeted Silk Road auction bidders with phishing scams.\n\nUltimately, however, this sale means that the government is now out of the Bitcoin business, a prospect should relieve fans of BTC who thought the government would use the coins to manipulate prices or drive up demand. In the end, the bitcoins went to auction alongside a Gulfstream jet, a Vizio TV, and a bus.', 'For all the media coverage, and for all the venture capitalist interest, the average person on the street still knows nothing about bitcoin.\n\nAccording to a study released by the nonprofit Coin Center last month, 65% of the general public is “not at all familiar” with the digital currency or its underlying technology. Of those who do have some awareness, 84% have never used it.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped authors from rushing in to churn out books on bitcoin. In 2014, hundreds of books were published on the topic. Why are business writers so intrigued? Fortune spoke to the authors of three recent serious books on the topic. Below are five questions from each conversation.\n\nThe Bitcoin Big Bang, by Brian Kelly, investor and frequent CNBC guest\n\nFortune: You were skeptical about bitcoin at first, but then you came around. Why did you feel you now need to convince others of its importance?\n\nBrian Kelly: I realized it’s a revolution that is happening in my industry. As a currency trader, as an economist, I needed to know everything I could about this, because it’s a disruptive technology. And there are so many good stories that can be told about bitcoin. I’m into the economics of digital currency, and the technicals behind it. But I couldn’t code my way out of a paper bag. So the book is directed towards the layperson. I tried to write it as non-technically as possible.\n\nIs bitcoin a smart investment?\n\nThe volatility is its biggest knock right now. And how do you value the currency? Well, there’s no intrinsic value apart from the hope that some time in the future, someone will want to buy it and will pay for it. It operates on the same kind of “greater fool theory” as gold. And I don’t mean that in a negative way. But we have this opportunity to rebuild the financial system. Is the “greater fool” theory the best method? It may very well be, but that discussion needs to be had, at the very least.\n\nAre you seeing interest from Wall Street?\n\nJust the start of it—people asking what is it all about. I get two general responses: “Wow, this is exciting, tell me how to use it,” and, of course, this being Wall Street, “how do I make money from it?” But then there’s also the group that has a vested interest in keeping everything the same, and says, “it’s not money, I don’t understand how it works, we’re staying away from it.”\n\nJamie Dimon called it “a terrible store of value.”\n\nHe’s not wrong, right now. And bitcoin’s volatility matters. I have faith that the price will crawl back up. But there are other digital currencies that are starting to do things too. I would use Ripple as an example. So I’m a proponent of other digital currencies. We need more than one. And I think these other currencies will be a new asset class for Wall Street. I’m talking 10, 20 years down the road. That will become one portion of your portfolio.\n\nThere’s a lot of excitement around the New York Stock Exchange backing the Coinbase exchange. Is the hype merited?\n\nI do think NYSE taking a role in the Coinbase exchange is a watershed moment for bitcoin. I look at the exchanges as the brokerage firms of the digital currency space, and I think multiple can exist if you think about each one as a brokerage firm. So, is Gemini [the bitcoin exchange coming from the Winklevoss brothers] going to be the Charles Schwab of digital currencies? I don’t know, but that’s how I might think of it.\n\nBlockchain by Melanie Swan\n\nBlockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy, by Melanie Swan, philosophy professor and founder of The Institute for Blockchain Studies\n\nFortune: Your book is really more academic than others out there, and far more focused, specifically on the blockchain. It’s not a bitcoin 101.\n\nMelanie Swan: This is definitely not a 101 book. My aim was really to focus my attention on the blockchain as a new form of information technology, and the possibility that it opens up the ways we think in financial markets.\n\nWhy is the blockchain so exciting to you?\n\nBitcoin is just one example of something that uses a blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are just one example of decentralized technologies. And now that the Internet is big enough and diverse enough, I think we will see different flavors of decentralized technologies and blockchains. I think decentralized networks will be the next huge wave in technology. The blockchain allows our smart devices to speak to each other better and faster.\n\nBecause your book is so academic, and gets pretty wonky, what have you found is the adience?\n\nSo far, the audience has been industry people and futurists.\n\nSo the people you’re writing for already know about, and probably are interested in, bitcoin. How would you explain the excitement of the blockchain to a layperson?\n\nBlockchains add accountability, reliability and universal transparency in a more efficient way. On the Internet, we never had a payment layer. With blockchain technology, the financial remuneration layer is there, but also smart contracts, which can automate huge classes of behavior. Every asset we have, whether our cars, houses, or intellectual property—ideas, software, artwork—all of this can be registered, tracked, and transferred on the blockchain. And further, we can do property transfers, marriage contracts, all of our public records can be recorded via blockchain, and this will make governments more efficient.\n\nIs it fair to say you are pro-bitcoin?\n\nI am pro- technology that improves the lives of many people in any way possible, and I think the blockchain has the potential to do that. It is still an early-adopter technology right now without mainstream access options, but we will start to see more mainstream delivery models. The exciting part is how quickly this could take place—because the technology is there, it just needs to achieve adoption.\n\nThe Age of Cryptocurrency, by Paul Vigna and Michael Casey, Wall Street Journal reporters\n\nFortune: You two are covering bitcoin extensively for the Journal—is there any sense that the public interest isn’t quite there, that it doesn’t match our own media interest?\n\nPaul Vigna: You do need people interested in this now. But you need people in the right places. And I mean not just people who want to use it in their everyday lives, but you need people who are influential at companies. And those clearly exist. Someone at DISH Network [which now accepts bitcoin] had to get interested in it and start talking about it inside the company. Somebody at Microsoft had to get interested in it and start taking about it.\n\nOne common refrain from developers is that the public doesn’t need to care about it for it to succeed.\n\nDoes bitcoin need mom and pop? Yes, I think it does. People don’t think Apple Pay is a threat to bitcoin, but I think it is. With bitcoin, all you’re trying to do is sell people on a mobile payment system, and Apple is already doing that effectively. If Apple gets people hooked on its system, those people don’t need bitcoin. So I do think how much the average person uses it matters. But is it a deciding factor? I think not.\n\nWhat about the price drop, does that matter?\n\nThe value drop matters. But the thing about the price that I don’t think people really appreciate is that bitcoin is a rudimentary, unregulated marketplace. There’s no closing bell. A lot of the things that arrest slides on the NYSE don’t exist in the bitcoin world. When people see the price, they think it represents a fair value, but I don’t think that’s necessarily true. My personal take is that I think the value could be even lower, but be more stable. And that would be fine.\n\nPeople have said bitcoin needs to produce a “killer app” that is useful to the mainstream public. Do you agree?\n\nFor bitcoin itself, no, it doesn’t need to produce something immediately. But if you’re running a for-profit business, yes, things change for you. In the startup culture no one cares about profits. That’s very different from the rest of corporate America. Circle, Coinbase, Blockchain, Bitstamp, all these companies that have V.C. backing, they’re all in that startup culture and those guys operate under their own rules. Now, could it blow up in their faces? Of course it can. But I don’t think there’s pressure on them to quickly turn a profit. I think this story is going to play out over the next 10 years.\n\nYou and Michael cover bitcoin for a newspaper, but meanwhile you’ve got a book out that is very bullish on the technology. Is it difficult to stay objective here?\n\nThere’s been no conflict in the newsroom over our take on it. I think, at the WSJ, we’ve all realized this is an important story that needs to be told. So, we are pro-bitcoin. But are we pro- any one business or company? No. It’s possible to take something seriously and think it’s important without sacrificing objectivity. I think we walk that line. Also, it’s a great story! You kiddin’ me? This thing comes out of nowhere, kind of takes the world by storm, there’s a mysterious, anonymous founder… if you’re a journalist, how do you not want to tell that story?\n\nRead Fortune’s review of Vigna and Casey’s book here.', 'CoinTelegraph spoke to Miranda about his plans for the newly launched exchange, Bitcoin’s “untapped potential” in Latin America, and the increasing popularity of BTC in the world’s 7th largest economy, Brazil.\n\n“[O]ur local currency is getting weaker everyday. This contributes for the perfect environment for the Bitcoin ecosystem to flourish.” - Marcelo Miranda, FlowBTC Founder\n\nFlowBTC is Brazil’s newest Bitcoin exchange that just launched today. ""The problem with liquidity in Brazil is we have natural buyers, we have people who want to trade, but we don\'t have natural sellers,"" said Marcelo Miranda, a nine-year Deutsche Bank veteran and founder of FlowBTC, to CoinDesk.\n\nThis problem has been tackled via a partnership with AlphaPoint, a “software platform that powers exchanges,” as described by CEO Vadim Telyatnikov. As a result, FlowBTC will now be connected to other exchanges around the globe.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Why did you decide to establish FlowBTC in Brazil and how much of a demand is there for another domestic exchange in the country?\n\nMarcelo Miranda: The digital currency market in Brazil is still in its infancy. Even if you compare to much smaller countries, the volume of bitcoins traded in Brazil is negligible today. The main reason for this is the lack of an anchor exchange that professional traders and institutional investors can rely on. We are launching FlowBTC to cover this gap.\n\n“[W]atching closely people like Tony Gallippi and Roger Ver expressing their views about Bitcoin, I made a decision that this is what I wanted to do for a living.”\n\nCT: Why did you decide to part ways with Deutsche Bank and focus on Bitcoin?\n\nMM: While at DB I started to follow what was going on in the Bitcoin world. In late 2013, I decided to take a closer look and went to LABITCONF in Buenos Aires. There, by watching closely people like Tony Gallippi and Roger Ver expressing their views about Bitcoin, I made a decision that this is what I wanted to do for a living. When DB restructured their LatAm team in 2014, it was time for me to go all in with Bitcoin projects.\n\nCT: Prior to the official launch, FlowBTC was in “volume-rich” live beta. How many users have you attracted and how many do you expect to join after the launch?\n\nMM: We had around 200 live beta users, which was surprising given that we did a controlled roll out just to give us an idea of how much potential there is locally. We expect this number to grow at least 10-fold in the first few weeks of trading.\n\nCT: Your website states that you use “the most thorough security and privacy criteria.” Given the recent hacks at other exchanges like Bitstamp, BTER and Bitcoin’s security concerns in general, how do you ensure that your customer’s funds are safe?\n\nMM: We have the highest standards when it comes to security. For this reason we only work with the best possible technology partners. Our security and privacy standards are on par with some of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges in the world.\n\nCT: Multi-signature security is starting to become standard among exchanges in preventing account hacks. Are you planning to implement this feature?\n\nMM: We recognize the importance of multi sig and that\'s definitely in our plans for the short term.\n\n“Brazil is the 7th largest economy in the world and as people become more aware of Bitcoin, we will naturally take the lead regionally.”\n\nCT: The Latin American Bitcoin conference was held in Rio in December 2014 and in Buenos Aires in 2013. Is it too early to say that Brazil is becoming the epicenter for cryptocurrency in LA?\n\nMM: I don\'t think it\'s too early to say that. Brazil is the 7th largest economy in the world and as people become more aware of Bitcoin, we will naturally take the lead regionally. The number of initiatives and new ventures that are popping up every day in Brazil proves this point.\n\nCT: What do you think of the idea of decentralized exchanges that enable P2P, trustless trading (e.g. Coinffeine)? Would you consider implementing such features in the future?\n\nMM: This is definitely the future but we have to go hand in hand with our market and customers. Right now we don\'t see local demand for that but it is surely in our radar.\n\nCT: Do you think Brazil has some unique advantages that can help drive overall bitcoin adoption? (For example, the Boleto i.e. a paper invoice system used throughout the country for paying for all sorts of goods and services; utility bills, top-ups, online shopping, etc., which can be funded with BTC, essentially making it possible to pay for almost anything with bitcoin unlike in other countries).\n\nMM: There are definitely some unique features in the Brazilian market. The boleto is one of them. We can also point out that Brazilian people spend a lot of time online (second only after Americans) and the penetration of smartphones is extremely high. In addition to that, our local currency is getting weaker everyday. This contributes for the perfect environment for the Bitcoin ecosystem to flourish.\n\nCT: What’s your prediction for the BTC price by the end of 2015?\n\nMM: That\'s a tough one especially with the volatility we are seeing. My best ""guesstimate"" is that we take a leg higher after the overhang from the US Marshals is over and stay in the US$300-$350 range for a while, but from now to December is a long time for Bitcoin.\n\nDid you enjoy this article? You may also be interested in reading these ones:', 'At tax time, you can generally settle your bill by cash (though not necessarily folded cash), check or credit card. A New Hampshire State Representative is hoping to add another way to pay: Bitcoin.\n\nA bill introduced earlier this year in New Hampshire, HR552, would require the state\'s treasurer to ""develop an implementation plan for the state to accept bitcoin as payment for taxes and fees."" Under the bill, the plan would have to be in place by 2017.\n\nRepresentative Eric Schleien (R) has bipartisan support for the plan, with two Democrat and five Republican cosponsors.\n\nAccording to the bill\'s fiscal notes, the Treasury department anticipates an increase in state expenditures ""because the Department has no familiarity with bitcoin cash operations and therefore cannot determine in advance how much time and effort will be required to become informed and address the areas of accounting, valuation, and management."" There would be no impact on county and local expenditures. On the downside, moving to Bitcoin won\'t necessarily result in more folks paying their taxes, with Treasury determining that ""[t]here will be no impact on state, county, and local revenue.""\n\nBitcoin first appeared on the global currency scene in 2009. Bitcoins are digital currency which means that you don\'t rely on an exchange of paper for transactions and there is no centralized bank that records your transaction. Instead, Bitcoin is stored in a digital ""wallet"" which can be found on your computer. You spend Bitcoin just as you would a dollar bill on everything from buying cupcakes in San Francisco to shopping for patio furniture on Overstock.com .\n\nIn 2014, Overstock became the largest major retailer to date to tout the acceptance of Bitcoin as payment. Overstock\'s public overture put pressure on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to clarify how Bitcoin would be treated for federal tax purposes. A few months later, IRS finally issued guidance in the matter, making it clear that Bitcoin and similar currencies are to be treated as a capital asset for purposes of federal income tax (it\'s not reportable for FBAR purposes - for now).\n\nBut while Bitcoin has made strides in popularity, the government has been reticent to embrace the virtual currency. For now, IRS does not accept Bitcoin as payment for your tax obligation - although that doesn\'t mean that you can\'t pay your taxes using Bitcoin. Bitcoin-based shopping cart snapCard expanded its offerings last year with a service that allowed customers to pay the IRS. For the service, snapCard works like a payment processor - akin to a MasterCard or Visa - where you indicate how much you need to pay and you\'re invoiced directly for that amount. As with credit cards, a processing fee applies.\n\nThat processing fee is what worries some in government. Currently, IRS doesn\'t charge a processing fee to taxpayers to pay using a credit card. Instead, payments are processed by a payment processor who charges a processing fee to the taxpayer.\n\nIt\'s clear that Representative Schleien is hopeful that a similar arrangement would work in New Hampshire. He believes that payment using Bitcoin would not cost the state “one cent” in processing fees.\n\nThe idea hasn\'t been completely embraced by politicians in New Hampshire, as evidenced by the hearing\n\nNo state currently accepts Bitcoin directly as payment for taxes. However, it\'s clear that the idea is garnering some interest. In addition to New Hampshire, the state of Utah (maybe not-so-coincidentally the home of Overstock.com) is exploring the idea. This year, Utah State Representative Marc K. Roberts (R), introduced H.C.R. 6, Substitute Concurrent Resolution on Payment Options for State Services which proposes the creation of a Council on Payment Options for State Services to study whether and how the state could accept Bitcoin as a valid form of payment. Included in the list of potential services, via the Office of the State Treasurer and the State Tax Commission, would be the payment of taxes.\n\nFor now, most of these ideas are still exploratory - but not so far-fetched. In a recent poll for The Wall Street Journal’s MoneyBeat blog, a whopping 83% of respondents indicated there is a future for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Whether that future includes a payment option for your taxes remains to be seen.', 'Bitcoin price increased yesterday to print a high of around $285, yet today’s trading started by an increase in the selling volume which pulled the price downwards to around $271 at the time of writing of this analysis.

Accordingly, we can now spot a rising support level as shown by the green trend line on the below chart. The SMAs of the William’s Alligator indicator have just started to realign into a bullish alignment; however, if the bullish alignment becomes more pronounced during the next few hours (jaw on top, teeth in the middle and lips at the bottom), we can see a bullish wave start today to push the price upwards again.\n\nBy studying the 1 day Bitfinex (BTC/USD) charts from tradingview.com, calculating the 20, 50 and 100 day EMAs and plotting the MACD and Vortex indicators, we can conclude the following:\n\nBitcoin price is still above the 20 and 50 day EMAs which reflects the new uptrend, but it is lower than the 100 day EMA. When can expect to see an even stronger bullish rally when bitcoin price rises above the 100 day EMA.\n\nThe MACD indicator is still in the positive territory and signals a bullish wave, so we expect bitcoin price to resume rising within the next 48 hours.\n\nThe downtrend red line of the Vortex indicator has crossed above the uptrend blue line. The bullish run will be preceded by a rise of the uptrend blue line above the downtrend red line.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBitcoin price resumed rising yesterday to print a high of $285.

03/07/2015,"['To get updates of my thoughts on bitcoin and the global financial markets please follow @sammantic.\n\nMiles Kimball, who is a Professor of Economics and Survey Research at the University of Michigan tells CoinTelegraph about negative interest rates, the future of paper and electronic money, and how cryptocurrrency fits in.\n\nNegative interest rates are a recent topic garnering much attention in the economic world. In no particular order, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Sweden have or have recently had negative interest rates. On top of that some corporate bonds have had negative interest rates as well like Nestle and Shell.\n\nWhat are Negative Interest Rates\n\nNegative interest rates are when you give the bank or government some form of money, and over time that bank or government will give you back less money than you initially deposited.\n\nEssentially, you are paying a bank or government to take care of your money. This is the result of a flight to safety for people who are extremely risk averse, and it generally happens coming out of a massive recession in places where there is little to no growth (e.g. the EU).\n\nCoinTelegraph: Why is it easier to have negative interest rates with electronic money vs paper? Also can you explain how this would work with a currency like bitcoin vs. ""electronic dollars""?\n\nMiles Kimball: It is easy to have negative interest rates for money in the bank: the number for the balance in the account gradually goes down if nothing is put in or taken out. Because paper money has a particular number written on it, getting a negative or positive interest rate for paper currency requires a little more engineering. And that engineering involves having the e-dollar be the unit of account.\n\nIf the paper dollar were the unit of account, then the interest rate for paper currency is always zero (unless you have a system of directly taxing paper currency, which is administratively burdensome and politically much more difficult than an electronic money system). So to have negative interest rates on paper currency as well as in other assets, the e-dollar needs to be the unit of account.\n\n“[I]t is fine to have private cryptocurrencies perform the medium-of-exchange and store-of-value functions of money […].”\n\nWith the e-dollar as the unit of account, everything the central bank needs to do to have a nonzero paper currency interest rate can be done at the central bank\'s cash window where banks come to deposit or withdraw paper currency from the central bank.\n\nFor good monetary policy, it is important that the central bank have control over the unit of account. And this e-dollar unit of account might have many of the aspects of a cryptocurrency--perhaps enough that it can be considered a cryptocurrency.\n\nAs far as private cryptocurrencies (like bitcoin) go, it is fine to have private cryptocurrencies perform the medium-of-exchange and store-of-value functions of money, but monetary policy requires control over the unit of account. So central banks need to retain control over the type of money that defines the unit of account--in this case the e-dollar.\n\nUnder an electronic money policy, 3 key things will insure that the e-dollar (or e-euro or e-yen or e-pound etc.) is the unit of account:\n\na requirement that taxes be calculated in e-dollars.\n\naccounting standards that require accounting to be done in e-dollars.\n\nthe kind of need for coordination between businesses and between businesses and households that leads people to do daylight savings time (without any intrusive inspections of someone coming to look at your clocks).\n\n“To have negative interest rates in a cryptocurrency system […] there should be a separation between the unit of account and the medium of exchange.”\n\nCT: How can you have negative interest rates in a cryptocurrency system?\n\nMK: To have negative interest rates in a cryptocurrency system that uses bitcoin, say, for most transactions, there should be a separation between the unit of account and the medium of exchange.\n\nHaving an e-dollar that is distinct from a bitcoin is the way to do this. (Also, it is good to have many different stores of value. But that always happens.)\n\nCurrently, robots cannot do monetary policy as well as central banks can. Someday maybe they will be able to. Then a robot can be put in charge of the e-dollar. But there would still need to be a separation between the e-dollar unit of account (controlled by a robot) and anything that mechanically has a zero interest rate stated in terms of itself (as bitcoin now does).\n\nCT: What are your thoughts on bitcoins ability to be a currency? What are its limits from your perspective?\n\nMK: Bitcoin is a currency already. But it would not be good to try to use it as a ""full-service"" currency. A good unit of account needs to have a constant value relative to goods and services. Bitcoin does not do this. And it cannot keep a constant value relative to goods and services without a much, much, more sophisticated algorithm for controlling the supply of bitcoins that would rival in complexity (and exceed in quality) what central banks now do. Good monetary policy is not easy.\n\n“Central banks (which are humans assisted by computers) still do a much, much better job at monetary policy than the bitcoin algorithm would.”\n\nThe unit of account should be under the control of the institution that does the best job at keeping the value of the unit account constantly relative to goods and services--and in the process, keeps the economy at its natural level of output.\n\nCurrently, that is central banks. Bitcoin\'s value fluctuates wildly relative to goods and services. Central banks (which are humans assisted by computers) still do a much, much better job at monetary policy than the bitcoin algorithm would.\n\nCT: Also if you could talk more about blockchain technology and central banks? What type of tools/operations would be best suited for a blockchain?\n\nMK: I am not a technical expert on blockchains, but I think blockchains or technical advances inspired by blockchains will be important in making e-dollars work as well as possible. Electronic dollars include money in the bank, but its being done in a very inefficient way, and transaction costs are huge, banks need to go the way of bitcoin. Blockchain technology is a great advance because it can do it much more cheaply than how the current banking system handles transactions now. It will make electronic transactions will be much more meaningful.\n\nCT: Do you have any thoughts on the ""currency wars"" and their impact on central bank policies? Do negative interest rates have anything to do with this?\n\nMK: Talk of ""currency wars"" is mostly silly. If all countries do expansionary monetary policy, that is not a currency war, that is a global monetary expansion not a currency war. If every time you read about a ""currency war,” you substituted the words ""global monetary expansion,"" you would not go far wrong.\n\nThe only case when the word ""currency war"" is justified is when countries are each doing currency interventions by selling their own assets and buying equivalent foreign assets. If all countries do this, it all cancels out, and things are back to square one.\n\nAs long as each country or its central bank is purchasing assets that have a higher interest rate or rate of return than the assets they are selling, it is a monetary expansion, not a salvo in a currency war.\n\nOf course, monetary expansions have an effect on exchange rates, but if another country is not happy with that effect on its exchange rate, it should just match with its own, appropriately calibrated monetary expansion. That response is not a response in a ""currency war,"" it is normal monetary policy.\n\n“[B]eing able to do negative interest rates makes it possible to nip recessions in the bud.”\n\nCT: Can you say what incentivizes central banks to have negative interest rates?\n\nMK: The job of central banks is to keep keep prices stable and to keep the economy on an even keel by keeping output at the natural level. Doing both of these jobs well requires at least occasional use of negative interest rates.\n\nAs it is, the Fed, the ECB, the Bank of England, and now the Bank of Japan have a long-run inflation target of 2% because they haven\'t yet put negative paper currency interest rates in their toolkit. Being prepared to do negative interest rates allows the inflation target to be reduced to 0--true price stability.\n\nAnd being able to do negative interest rates makes it possible to nip recessions in the bud. These are big enough advantages that I think the eventually most central banks will indeed put negative (and positive) paper currency interest rates in their toolkit.\n\nMiles Kimball is an expert on negative interest rates as well as paper money vs. electronic money, and is a major proponent of electronic money. He writes on his own blog discussing e-money as well as other economic themes.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Of course, this is an exaggeration, but it goes to show how the service is entrenched in Kenyan society.\n\nM-Pesa facilitating Bitcoin adoption in Africa\n\nFor those who might not be privileged to know what M-Pesa is, this is a mobile system that allows people to store money on their cell phones and, most importantly, pass it around.\n\nIt is now a norm to pay for your dinner at a restaurant using M-Pesa and even buy electricity tokens from the power supply company when you reach home and you are greeted with a blackout since the previous token has expired.\n\nVodafone through its local subsidiary, Safaricom, launched M-Pesa in 2005. Since then this service has grown so big so that when there is system downtime, everything across the country seems to come to a standstill.\n\nAnd the numbers explain why this is so. Of the 40 million Kenyans approximately living in the country, there are close to 17 million active M-Pesa accounts. That means if you took away the approximate number of those under and over the age of the majority, it becomes clear that almost every adult transacts using the mobile money service.\n\nOn the face of it, M-Pesa it seems to be the perfect competitor that bitcoin has to take on if it dreams of becoming mainstream in the country. However, recent developments seem to point to the opposite.\n\nBitpesa\n\nIn November 2013, the digital currency exchange, Bitpesa, opened up shop in the country and one of its leveraging tools turned out to be M-Pesa.\n\nIts initial target market was individuals sending money from UK to Kenya. While the sender sends bitcoins, the recipient receives the money in the form of Kenyan Shillings with their mobile number or M-Pesa account serving as the digital wallet.\n\nBut that seem to have expanded to enable individuals to covert their money between shillings and bitcoin using an M-Pesa account. Indeed, it is now possible to buy bitcoins using M-Pesa for other purposes such as trading.\n\nAnd the cost of all these transactions is capped at 3%.\n\nThings seem to be going well for the company as it was able to raise up to US$1.1 million in its second round of funding from San Francisco-based Pantera Capital, Crypto Currency Partners, Future/Perfect Ventures, Stephens Investment Management, and Bitcoin Opportunity Corp. among others in February 2015.\n\nTagpesa\n\nAnd this is not the only company that is using M-Pesa to transact between fiat and bitcoin. Tagpesa, a local company, got into the market in late February with a similar service.\n\nAt about the same time, the company was acquired by the Australian exchange Igot, one of the fastest-growing Bitcoin exchanges in the world. It is already operating in close to 50 countries, including the Middle East.\n\nIn result, what these two companies have done is turn a potential formidable business rival into a dependable partner. And at least for the foreseeable future, these services seem to be the simplest, cheapest and most convenient channels through which Kenyans will interact with bitcoin.\n\nby Daniel Nyairo\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Here, he discusses where the monetization is behind decentralized business models.\n\nIf we are to strictly follow bitcoin’s first principles of decentralization, then very little to no money should be made by the centers.\n\nBitcoin, the system, is itself the quintessential decentralized and autonomous ecosystem today. And its center is poor, because it is non-existent as an entity. All of the revenues/profits are being made at the edges of the bitcoin network.\n\nSo, if we are to mirror bitcoin, we need to stay true to its decentralized characteristics and properties; not just as a matter of principle, but as a matter of operational integrity.\n\nAs it evolves, decentralization is not something that is categorically there or not there. It’s not a black or white situation yet. There are different flavors, shades and degrees of decentralization. It is becoming something we aim for and reach over time, not overnight. I’ve already described the “ideal” framework for distributed autonomous organizations, and it’s not that easy getting there.\n\nThe nature of centers\n\nIt used to be that nothing happened without central authorities, or central powers, or central regulations, or central approvals. With decentralization, it’s the opposite. Everything happens at the edges, and at the nodes near the peripheries of the overall network.\n\nWith decentralization, you don’t install a center first. You install a platform that enables the network to flourish where the “center” of attention (used figuratively) and activity are the nodes and the peripheral users.\n\nWe should not bastardize or compromise on the decentralization concept by picking and choosing which of its characteristics we want to adopt and which ones we reject.\n\nThe vision brought by bitcoin includes:\n\nSpeed of money/transactions transfers\n\nNo intermediaries between transactions\n\nFlat organizational structures\n\nTrust inside the network\n\nResiliency of the network against attacks or censorship, with no central point of failure\n\nDecisions and changes based on reasonable consensus processes\n\nFluidity from peer to peer\n\nAnd “peer to peer” means “peer to peer”, ie without anyone in the middle to buffer, delay, or try to simulate P2P.\n\nWhat will bitcoin enable us to do?\n\nCompare bitcoin to the Internet, in terms what we are being empowered with. Arguably, it was the ability for anyone to become a publisher of content. Whether you are sharing a photo, a comment or a blog post, you are publishing something and expressing yourself freely on the Internet.\n\nWhat is that equivalent (big) thing that bitcoin will allow us to do really well? Is it to be our own bank? Is it to run legal contracts between each other without third party clearinghouses? Is it to earn value and cryptocurrency on our own, as a new type of work?\n\nFor decentralization to take full effect, we would need to see:\n\nDecentralized content distribution and exchange networks (maybe for digital goods initially), without central authorities that tax it or control it. Decentralized transportation services, based on peer to peer services, without companies like Uber taking excessive fees at the center. Decentralized storage, where we earn money by sharing unused capacities, without companies like Dropbox in the middle. Decentralized computing, without companies like Amazon Web Services serving it. Decentralized banking, where we control our money ourselves and wrap rules around how we spend it, without central banks. Decentralized gambling where trust is baked in, and without a house that’s not always so trusted. Decentralized exchanges for trading financial instruments or products, without central exchanges. Decentralized titles transfers or real estate transactions without central authorities that control the issuance of deeds. Decentralized public registries for documents such as marriages, without going through government registrars.\n\n[For more blockchain-based decentralized applications, I suggest checking the book Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy, and here’s my review on it.]\n\nIt’s not easy being decentralized\n\nApple’s iTunes is the typical centralized marketplace. If it were decentralized, first of all, Apple wouldn’t take a 30% cut on revenues. Second, whatever value is derived from app sales or via other monetization would be spread across users who use or promote an app by sharing their own stats for example, and Apple wouldn’t deserve that 30%.\n\nOf course, this is a hypothetical scenario, that is barely half-baked; but the nugget behind it is that the value is at the edges of the network, not at its center. Nothing happens without users that add value, so why not re-circulate a (large) part of that value back into the network to make it stronger?\n\nIt’s not easy to become decentralized. But it’s easier if it’s in your genesis, or if you are influenced to believe that way, or when you start a new organization from the ground-up as a decentralized network, platform, service, currency, or marketplace.\n\nThe challenge becomes: where is the monetization behind decentralized models? Often, a decentralized construct is based on two foundational components: a protocol and a marketplace.\n\nThe (technical) protocol is like the operating system, and monetization is hard there, but the marketplace is where the network lives, and you need to search for innovative monetization models inside the marketplace, especially with user features and services that overlay themselves on that network.\n\nAnd we must also ask for whom is the value transferred – the instigators or the participants? It’s very possible that value starts with the users who are the key actors in the decentralization organism. If the users benefit personally, then the network benefits collectively, and that spills over to whoever started the network.\n\nThe concept of “central operations” is shattered, because maybe it shouldn’t exist. The underlying protocol enables decentralized operations, and that is where the activity and value should reside.\n\nMy conclusion is that we are still learning and experimenting with business, revenue and value appreciation models behind decentralized networks, markets and organizations. One thing is for sure: the centers and operators should make less, and the collective of users/stakeholders/participants will make more.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The overall upward trajectory is moving between Fib fan lines originating from the 2013 all-time high.\n\nThe approach to the overhead Fib line seems to have the objective of imminent crossover to the upside. We’ve explored the presence of various layers of chart resistance in the area directly above but the market’s intention of entering the area is evident from the upswing in price action. Price may still meander around current levels but the manner in which price action has stuck to the 200MA for the past 12 hours, suggests that a move away is imminent.\n\nIf the move is to the upside, it would require strong and persistent buying to break above the Fib line near 1730 CNY ($285 Bitfinex). As we see from the crossing of the lower Fib line on the left of the chart, the market prefers a slow creeping approach when it comes to breaking through significant resistance and the current obstacle may need the same sideways approach to the upper Fib line. The process would draw volatility to near zero while compressing MACD and building the pressure needed for a strong surge higher.\n\nIf the latter scenario is the tactic of choice, then we still have a few days of sideways consolidation ahead. As was pointed out, earlier in the week, the corrective action no longer looks to be about achieving depth but about passing time.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin advance is gearing up to cross over $300. It may not be a smooth ride, but it will be the final nail in the coffin of the past year’s decline. Strong overhead resistance may see whipsawing price action as the bulls and bears battle it out: the bulls for a rally, and the bears for selling at obvious resistance levels at $280, $285, $290 and $300.\n\nThe Bitfinex depth chart is not the only one to feature large orders around $285.\n\nClick here for the CCN interactive price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

Speaking to CryptoCoinsNews, organizer Sarah Boone Martin said she had nonetheless been taken aback by the strength of response after launching the campaign.\n\n“We never anticipated Bitcoin Women’s Day would hit this big,” she said. “The response has been overwhelming.

We’ve been so caught up with bitcoin’s rising price following its big headline in The Wall Street Journal and the third (and possibly final) US Marshals Service bitcoin auction, which saw to another 50,000 bitcoins once belonging to alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht being desired and ogled at by a bunch of crypto-enthusiasts waiting to place their bids.\n\nSometimes bitcoin just takes up so much time and space that we forget about the “little guys” on the side; guys like litecoin, darkcoin, dogecoin and other altcoins that operate through similar means.\n\nBut are they little? I suppose when compared to bitcoin they’re somewhat smaller, but these altcoins hold their own ground, and often see expansion and growth when no one expects it.\n\nLast week saw to a few different altcoins leading the way in terms of performance. According to coinmarketcap.com, litecoin for example, is a true leader in the altcoin community. The litecoin price is close to two dollars, and the cryptocurrency boasts a market cap of over $71 million. Furthermore, litecoin witnessed a rise of about 1.36 percent last week, showing its doubters that its power remains true.\n\nAnother top performer was darkcoin. The altcoin’s fame and steady rise has been heavily monitored these last few weeks, and while it does not hold a market cap anywhere near the litecoin spectrum, the price of one darkcoin has risen to nearly $3.50. The digital currency saw a rise of nearly three percent in recent days, making it a force to be reckoned with.\n\nOther currencies that witnessed strong increases this past week include MaidSafeCoin (7.36 percent), Bytecoin (7.45 percent), and one known as Ethercoin, which experienced a rise of over 42 percent and is nearing $1 in price. A few others: Vertcoin, Stealthcoin, Pandacoin, and Syscoin.\n\nWhether bitcoin truly has some competition ahead remains to be seen, but one thing that can be said is the world of the altcoin is changing and growing, and digital currencies are earning attention like never before.', 'The 2015 S550 4Matic once again demonstrates the technical prowess of Mercedes-Benz engineers. However, five-star accommodations—including massaging seats and atomizing cabin fragrances—are not enough to fully satisfy 21st century beings with our insatiable desire for smart screens, Apple-esque user experiences, and apps. That’s why, in an effort to redefine luxury driving in the digital age, Mercedes has located its app design team in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America (MBRDNA) employs about 150 full-time digital designers and prototypers in Sunnyvale, Calif. They are working on apps, infotainment, autonomous driving, and battery technology.\n\n“All employees at Sunnyvale are contributing to the development of series production vehicles,” said Arwed Niestroj, chief executive of MBRDNA. In other words, Sunnyvale is not just an exercise in futuristic fantasy, but is integral to the production of today’s vehicles, in which connectivity plays an increasingly vital role—even for the powerful flagship S-Class lineup.\n\nFor the past week, while driving a 2015 S550 sedan—$135,925 as tested and decked out with every option—I played with semi-autonomous sensor-dependent features such as adaptive cruise control, active lane keeping, night vision camera, and 360-degree surround view. My only ding against the S550, and it’s not easy to find flaws, is the look and feel of the fully digital dashboard gauges. The design vocabulary feels slightly dated. I later learned that the main user interfaces for the S550 were done in Sindelfingen, Germany, rather than Sunnyvale.\n\nI downloaded the Mercedes-Benz “mbrace” mobile app, so I could remotely lock and unlock the car, locate its presence from a distance, and send an address directly from my iPhone to the car’s navigation system. These S550 mbrace functions were useful, but not as innovative as my first experience with Mercedes apps.\n\nLast year, I spent a week driving a 2014 Mercedes CLA with a Pebble smart watch on my wrist, wirelessly tied to the car’s digital nervous system. Because the Pebble received feeds from car’s Garmin navigation and GPS—providing my location and local speed limits—the watch vibrated and flashed a “Slow Down” message when I exceeded the speed limit by 10 percent.\n\nWhen I parked and stepped away from the CLA, the watch received a download of the car’s precise location, the trip distance and the amount of fuel left in the tank. On some models, though not my loaner CLA, you also get a reading of air pressure in all four tires.\n\nThese car-watch experiments, unveiled at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, might seem peripheral to driving—until you consider what Mercedes brought to CES 2015: the F 015 Luxury in Motion research vehicle, a fully autonomous vehicle with swivel seating that turns the cabin into a moving living room.\n\nThat’s where the role of Sunnyvale gets fascinating and weird: The Silicon Valley work by Mercedes and other carmakers are early steps toward a driving future in which the car itself becomes an app on wheels.\n\n“We created a whole set of new interfaces,” said Paola Malabuyo, vice-president of advanced user experience for Mercedes-Benz, speaking about the Mercedes autonomous concept car from the floor of CES. Passengers in the vehicle are surrounded by touchscreens—in the doors, on the windows, and in a full-width video dashboard, as well as the entire windshield turned into a heads-up display.\n\n“So you’re enveloped in a 360-degree virtual reality screen?” I asked. “Pretty damn close,” said Malabuyo. “It’s everywhere you look.”\n\nWhile he said the features of the test car were perhaps a decade or two away from reality, the underlying question of the research project applies to the S550. Malabuyo pondered: “How can we do these things so it’s still a Mercedes-Benz experience?”\n\nThe folks at the Mercedes Sunnyvale research center are thinking (and designing) ahead with these challenges in mind. But there are more pressing threats facing Mercedes in these endeavors. Johann Jungwirth, Daimler’s long-time connected car guru and former chief executive of MBRDNA, left the company in September. He was hired by Apple, reportedly to lead its project to build an electric self-driving car.', '', 'Principal, Tecnologia uTorrent está usando seu computador e internet para minerar Bitcoin? Por Marcelo Ribeiro , em 7.03.2015\n\nParece que a última atualização do uTorrent está roubando processador do seu computador para gerar lucro com um programa chamado Epic Scale. E usando sua conexão de internet.\n\nHoje notei uma certa lentidão no chrome para algumas atividades. Ao verificar o Monitor de Atividade do Mac notei que o uTorrent estava usando 99% do processador destinado a ele. Mesmo sem nenhum download ativo, apenas poucos uploads leves. Imediatamente desinstalei e removi o uTorrent, mesmo depois de tantos anos usando ele como meu único cliente de Torrent.\n\nO que é o Epic Scale\n\nO problema apareceu na versão 3.4.2 do uTorrent.\n\nO Epic Scale pode ser usado tanto para resolver problemas de biologia molecular, encontrar inteligência extraterrena ou minerar Bitcoin. Mas também fará seu computador gastar mais eletricidade e, caso não esteja funcionando apenas quando você não usa o computador, deixá-lo mais lento.\n\nAs questões legais\n\nNão há nenhum problema em gerar lucro com software livre gratuito. Os criadores do uTorrent admitem que o Epic Scale pode ser instalado exclusivamente com a permissão do usuário, durante a instalação do cliente uTorrent, no entanto não foi o que parece ter ocorrido e o que muitos outros usuários estão relatando: a instalação do Epic Scale pode ter sido silenciosa, sem a autorização dos usuários.\n\nSegundo a empresa é possível que que estes usuários tenham aceitado a oferta por acidente e instalado o software. Talvez eu tenha feito isto já que a tela da oferta é extremamente similar a uma etapa comum de instalação:\n\nEsta é a instalação na versão para Mac. A instalação para Windows parece infinitamente mais complicada e ainda menos transparente.\n\nTalvez o problema seja apenas falta de transparência. A tela poderia deixar claro que é uma instalação de software adicional para não confundir o usuário a aceitar uma instalação adicional sem que tenha interesse. Desta vez eu tenho certeza que recusei e me parece que o uTorrent está se comportando bem até o momento. [Trusted Reviews, 2, The Verge]\n\nVote:\n\n']"
03/08/2015,"['With more and more companies around the world accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, “fiat” has once again become part of the mainstream conversation, and is not only synonymous with those cute Italian cars. Fiat actually has a strong relation to money, which is why I’m writing about this subject. So, why is fiat currency important? There are global discussions on this topic, which are taking place in boardrooms across the globe. Now, it’s time to move those discussions to your dining room and get your children and grandchildren involved in the conversation.\n\nStart with what fiat currency is. It is actually “money” that a government, or group of people, decides has value. The “money” itself has no value; it is what it represents. The word fiat is actually Latin for “it shall be.” After the government (in most cases) establishes that it will accept this representation of value, it becomes what we call a medium of exchange, which means that people can exchange it for goods and services.\n\nThe first use of fiat currency was recorded in China around 1000 A.D. In the United States, fiat currency dates back to the beginnings of North American colonization. During the Civil War, the Federal Government issued United States Notes, a form of paper fiat currency popularly known as “greenbacks.” Later, in 1944, the Bretton Woods Agreement was created, which fixed the value of 35 U.S. dollars to one troy ounce of gold. In this case, the U.S. government promised to redeem the dollars in gold; however, during what we call the Nixon Shock in 1971, the ability to convert dollars into gold ended.\n\nWhy is this important? Because our offspring are experiencing a world full of fiat currency and they may not even realize it… frankly, some of us don’t even realize it. The biggest phenomenon around fiat currency today: Bitcoin. What is attracting attention around Bitcoin as a fiat currency is that it is NOT controlled by any singular government entity.\n\nMany Millennials think the concept of fiat currency of this kind is a new phenomenon. It is not. A case in point: when I was discussing what I considered a recent phenomenon with my close friend, Dr. Samuel Guillory, he pointed out that Baby Boomers grew up with this. He said, “Remember S&H Green Stamps?” Of course, I did! Every time we went to the supermarket, we were given S&H Green Stamps. My job was to lick those stamps and put them into the books. I’m sure my tongue is still green.\n\nDuring the 1960’s, S&H Green Stamps’ catalog was the largest publication in the U.S. and the company issued three times as many stamps as the U.S. Postal Service. How many of us where thrilled when we had saved enough to redeem those booklets for an ugly lamp? The lamp is not really the point; as consumers, we felt we were getting something for nothing. This “fiat” currency offered us that.\n\nAt a recent presentation at MoneyShow University in Orlando, Steve Forbes talked about fiat currency. He noted that we readily accept many things as an exchange of value. He also spoke about how a coat check person hands you a chit in exchange for your coat, which you will redeem later. He asked the audience to think of fiat as a measurement. We agree upon measurements like: pounds, time, miles, frequent flier miles, etc. This is a great conversation starter for you to have with your younger children and grandchildren. Allow them to come up with other examples.\n\nNostalgia makes for wonderful dinner conversation, but this article is not meant to create space for you to reminisce about your childhood. The fact is that many fiat currencies throughout history have failed. The Chinese had “flying money,” which was aptly named because these original paper banknotes would have a tendency to fly out of your hands. Ultimately, it failed because inflation crept in. Louis XV found that his paper currency became oversupplied, i.e., inflation took over and people demanded real coins that were made of gold and silver. We all know the stories of Germany, post-World War I, when the only way to repay war debt was to run the printing presses. The inflation was so huge that it was cheaper to heat your furnace using Germany’s currency than to buy firewood with it. To give you a dramatic example of this, the equivalent of one U.S. dollar would be 12 marks in 1919 and by 1923, that same U.S. dollar was equivalent to 4.2 trillion marks. Recently, the Russian ruble has become just another fiat currency to avoid because of deflation.', ""International remittance is ostensibly one of the most compelling use cases for bitcoin and digital currencies.\n\nRecorded remittances to Africa grew four-fold between 1990 and 2010 and have increased steadily since. The World Bank projects $39bn in remittances to sub-Saharan Africa this year.\n\nYet with the continent’s fast-growing middle class and tech-savvy youth population, the high cost of remitting to sub-Saharan Africa, particularly from within Africa, has brought the subject of financial inclusion under new light.\n\nAfrica has some serious market potential for bitcoin companies; remittance seems a logical way to enter. For all that goodwill and market opportunity, however, few bitcoin startups have emerged out of that region and many have had trouble gaining any significant foothold there.\n\nElizabeth Rossiello, chief executive of the Kenyan bitcoin remittance service BitPesa, told CoinDesk the opportunity is present because it’s hard to do business there.\n\n“It’s not this low hanging fruit that’s meant to be snatched up,” she said, adding:\n\n“Besides [South Africa] there’s nothing, there’s nobody else. Why? There’s millions and millions of dollars in bitcoin. People don't come here to do business because it’s not easy. Sometimes it’s even impossible.”\n\nNo easy answer to the unbanked\n\nThat bitcoin can service the “unbanked” and relieve them of the problems that come from being financially excluded is a beautiful ambition, but it’s unlikely that a new financial product could simply enter the market and solve the problems that other financial products before could not.\n\nThe poor have assets, they just can’t monetize them.\n\nRossiello said:\n\n“Anybody who’s unbanked or anybody who’s at the lower end of the spectrum financially doesn't want a fluctuating asset. There are many, many uses for fluctuating assets, but holding value for people who are conscious of it is not one of them.”\n\nRossiello moved to Nairobi from New York in 2009. She had worked as a ratings analyst in mobile money and microfinance, and as an adviser linking big banks with small banks and big products with small products. She finds the many emerging wallets and non-smartphone applications targeting the bottom of the pyramid a little bit misguided.\n\nSmall amounts of access to financial savings have differential effects on low-income people. There’s no long-term financial planning at that level, she said, and even if they lose only $0.10 a day in bitcoin, that’s significant. Those in the unbanked or underbanked demographic won’t look to hold their value in it.\n\n“The people that are currently unbanked might be unbanked for certain reasons,” she said. “Maybe they’re nomads, maybe they’re under the employment age. They might not be bankable, they might not be financially active in the same way. That kind of population might be better suited for cash transfer products.”\n\nIt’s not enough to bring in a financial tool or mandate access to banks, like the Nigerian central bank has. Usage is a key component of development.\n\nRodger Voorhies is the director of the Financial Services for the Poor team at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest private grant-making NPO in the world. He pointed out that millions of people are excluded from financial services, yet they don't even have a way to save their money from one season to the next.\n\n“We know from the empirical evidence that it’s not just having a bank account that’s magical, it’s actually using it if there’s an emergency to fall back on,” he said. “Oftentimes people had money to go to the clinic when they were sick but they didn’t have money for medicine.”\n\nWho and where are the “unbanked”?\n\nRossiello contends that in the six years she’s lived in Nairobi, the idea of the unbanked and who they are has become elaborated, perhaps exaggerated. She said:\n\n“That’s just the myth about the unbanked, but that's not Africa. You have to remember that’s a tiny, tiny portion of it.”\n\nThe “unbanked” are 2.5 billion people left out of the financial system. They tend to be disproportionately female, rural, less educated, and the vast majority of them live in emerging markets concentrated in Sub-Saharan African, South Asia and Indonesia.\n\nSome 65% to 75% of people (excluding data from China) living on less than $2 a day don’t have access to a formal bank account. That figure rises to over 80% in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, according to the Gates Foundation.\n\nClaudia McKay, a senior financial sector specialist at the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), the global microfinance center for the World Bank, said the percentage of financially excluded is falling.\n\nIn some cases, especially in East Africa, they are decreasing more quickly. For example, the Kenyan population that is financially included through formal providers increased to 67% from 41% between 2009 and 2013. This, she said, is owed largely to mobile financial services.\n\n“Increasingly, financial services are being offered by non-banks – most notably, mobile network operators who offer digital financial services,” she said. “But there could also be insurance companies or microfinance organizations which are regulated and part of the formal sector even if they are not banks.”\n\nRich world technology, poor world systems\n\nSilicon Valley illuminati talk a big talk about how new technology can save the old, still developing world and relieve the “underbanked”. But rich-world technologies don’t easily transfer to dissimilar economies.\n\nBitPesa’s approach has been to build a product that works immediately and has functional capabilities. It came to market in just under six months, launching officially in November 2013. Last month it closed a $1.1m funding round and extended its remittance service, allowing users in Kenya and Ghana to send fiat funds to popular mobile money wallets.\n\n“Compare that to the San Francisco Bay Area where people are paid $350,000 yearly for ten years to take a couple years off and do amazing, beautiful projects,” Rossiello said. “This is not the place for that, but this is the place for products to get up and going quickly. You need a product that works first.”\n\nThat’s why she sees e-commerce and retail as the greatest areas of opportunity for bitcoin startups in Africa. Further, the competition is different: PayPal isn’t present in many African markets, and credit card penetration across the continent remains low.\n\nAnd yet, the bitcoin companies that have emerged in Africa over the last two years are exchanges, bitcoin ATMs, wallet companies and remittance services. BitPesa is growing and continues to attract interest, but many of these startups have been defeated by the context Africa provides.\n\nThe failure of the regulatory landscape\n\nTo build a business in Africa is to weave through a myriad of regulation. Expat entrepreneurs will recall many others like them that they’ve seen come and leave, unable to navigate it.\n\nThis is one of Africa’s most consequential failures – not creating an enabling regulatory environment for businesses.\n\nRegulations are complex. Sometimes they lack clarity; sometimes they counteract others from different ministries. Often, Voorhies said, the most difficult things aren’t the regulations themselves, but the bureaucracy to implement them in a way that’s friendly to business.\n\nHe explained:\n\n“You have this byzantine regulation where in some cases pieces have been updated, others have not – you have a kind of siloed control of different ministries that test different parts of the ecosystem.”\n\nAt times, provisions create further and perhaps unnecessary hurdles for the company; in others, it is permitted to operate with hardly any regulatory oversight, according to Stefan Staschen, an advisor on digital financial services regulation at CGAP.\n\n“The main difference between countries is whether they permit non-banks to issue digital accounts on their own – typically under non-bank e-money issuer rules – or whether the accounts have to be issued by banks,” he explained. “Ideally both are possible to allow for competition between different models.”\n\nThe most important regulatory concerns relate to agents, CFT rules, e-money rules, consumer protection, and competition, Staschen said, adding that a growing number of countries in the region have published specific guidance on these issues.\n\nInfrastructure vs financial services\n\nInfrastructure is another paramount problem for entrepreneurs in Africa, but Voorhies implied that it’s closely related to the state of regulation – or it should be.\n\nHe said:\n\n“Financial regulations and governments support all kinds of infrastructure if it’s important for economic development – it’s growth, it’s electricity, it’s sanitation – and they also are proportionally supportive of large financial institutions in those societies. Why hasn’t it arrived at an obligation that that infrastructure extends into these rural communities?”\n\nYears before arriving at the Gates Foundation, Voorhies opened and ran a bank in Lilognwe, Malawi – one of the poorest parts in one of the poorest countries in the world – that he said grew to be the biggest in the country in terms of customers. The infrastructure in Africa, he explained, isn’t designed for the climate or the way financial services work on the ground there.\n\nHe described the independence, responsibility and man-power it took and the need to build everything himself; to find a way to save water, to figure out how to generate power.\n\n“Even down to running ATMs, the notes that were coming into the ATMs were so dirty we couldn’t reuse them so we had to send them to the central bank to get new ones,” he said.\n\nAnd the infrastructure didn’t reach rural areas, he added, so he did some of the early work in moving from food aid to cash payments in Lilognwe.\n\n“There was not even a radio signal, there was no infrastructure at all,” he continued. “You have these people that were completely broken off from the larger economy and I think that without financial services you create these economic deserts that exist.”\n\nBut it’s turning around\n\nIt’s easy to come away with bad news of why it’s hard to do business in Africa, but those paying the most attention to the situation agree that it’s improving slowly but surely in the right direction, even if it’s not as visible looking from outside in.\n\n“The rise of mobile money has spawned more startups than ever before seeing new opportunities of reaching the mass market now that the space has moved beyond just banks.”\n\nThe Gates Foundation is pushing strongly for the separation of intermediation – who can hold money on behalf of customers and reinvest it – and running payments systems. East Africa has been at the front of this.\n\n“I think we’re seeing regulation change accelerate,” Voorhies said. “Places like Ghana that were more difficult just three or four years ago are now changing, East Africa is changing. Nigeria has made initial steps and there’s now a financial inclusion secretariat, and it is the largest country in Africa that is going to make changes.”\n\nMcKay said she sees a lot of emerging businesses addressing financial inclusion.\n\n“The rise of mobile money has spawned more startups than ever before seeing new opportunities of reaching the mass market now that the space has moved beyond just banks,” she said.\n\nA lot of Africa is witnessing booming economies, Rossiello said; high rises and office buildings going up everyday, reverse diaspora movements – the growing middle class is getting the benefits of low friction and easy infrastructure to build on, compared to other regions.\n\nBut South Africa doesn't count\n\nLast July, BitX, a bitcoin exchange headquartered in Singapore but whose development team is based in Cape Town, partnered with PayFast, a major South African payments gateway, to provide the bitcoin payment option to customers of more than 30,000 merchants. Later that summer, Johannesburg welcomed Africa’s first bitcoin ATM. In January, South African bitcoin exchange ICE3X partnered with a Nigerian payments processor to launch Nigeria’s first bitcoin exchange.\n\nIn some ways South Africa doesn't suffer from the same infrastructural problem, Voorhies said. It has incredible work force and technical skills and a well-developed banking system.\n\nSouth Africa has proportional KYC, he added; business owners setting up aren’t inundated with loads of required documents to get onto the system. It has a risk-based approach to many of the regulations that allow access to different parts of the financial system without full regulation.\n\nRossiello said the South African market is very different from other markets in sub-Saharan Africa and across the continent. The regulation, infrastructure and talent coming out of its local development schools, she agreed, are better. There’s more money, and therefore startups can be at a greater ease of doing business.\n\nShe also said there’s a lot more talent there to develop a cryptocurrency market.\n\nRossiello explained:\n\n“You just see a lot more evolved businesses – evolved meaning they were already in financial services or banking services and lulled into crypto companies. What you’ll see elsewhere is a crypto company pop up from scratch, and that has pros and cons.”\n\nSouth Africa’s affluent areas are a world apart from what much of the continent is used to; they might be satisfied with what they have while poorer parts feel disenfranchised. And lining up both sides in a coherent regulatory environment is clearly a challenge.\n\nBut for as long it remains so, perhaps the best move for developers and entrepreneurs and their ambitions of putting Africans on the financial grid might be to develop new technology, new businesses, new products and services in South Africa, and export them out to regions with a friendlier regulatory environment where they can cause more meaningful changes.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The MyCoin pyramid scheme in Hong Kong defrauded a small number of very high rollers; people who were investing millions of US Dollars each. This created a reported cache of almost $400 million before the computer bandits made their getaway. Now, it seems that some headway has been made in the investigation, and the arrests are starting to come in. And some adjustments to the actual level of theft have also been made.\n\nFive arrests made related to the MyCoin Scam\n\nThe arrest made by authorities include a group of five mid-level hustlers, scattered throughout the region, with one even apprehended on a boat. These females handled the face-to-face fraud and fundraising, which had many sectors of society involved, including bankers and realtors. The South China Morning Post reports:\n\n“One of the women was picked up when officers boarded a casino ship anchored off North Point yesterday morning. Police caught the other four at their homes in Yuen Long, Tin Shui Wai, Wong Tai Sin and North Point.”\n\nThere is also news on the amount of the initial heist. It now appears it was not anywhere near the reported $386 million. It seems that this number was also part of the scam, as this is what MyCoin said they held in assets themselves. According to Hong Kong’s Commercial Crime Bureau, after speaking with almost one hundred of the defrauded, the real amount lost is closer to $8 million. So this is not an economic catastrophe anywhere near the level of Mt. Gox, in 2013.\n\nThe problem with that is some individual investors have claimed that they have lost millions. The losses may be in Hong Kong Dollars, which is a very different amount in US Dollars.\n\n“I shouldn’t have been greedy. I was told by my real estate agent that the profit would be over HK$2 million after one year,” another investor, 81-year old Mrs. Chan said. She said she recovered only HK$1.2 million on her HK$3 million investment in seven different MyCoin contracts.\n\nAlso read: Hong Kong Shouldn’t Ban Bitcoin Because of Bad Actors\n\nMyCoin wasn’t selling its backers on trading accounts, but rather offered a form of equity investment it described as “Bitcoin contracts.” The marks were promised a 100% return within four months. Bonuses offered included Mercedes-Benz automobiles and cash prizes for successfully recruiting new participants, leading some to mortgage their homes to source funds. The victims were prohibited from divesting themselves unless they brought in new investors to replace themselves.\n\nThe leadership of MyCoin has yet to be found, but finding the underlings should yield some better leads, with the ability to offer plea deals to these criminals to get the masterminds. With the popularity of Bitcoin taking off worldwide, this is not the first, or last, of these scams.\n\nWhen putting your Bitcoins, which are basically electronic cash, into a third-party’s hands, you are handing over full control of them, like handing someone a $20 bill. Act accordingly. Bitcoins held within the Block Chain have proven safe. Held by another person or entity, not so much.\n\nCan the Bitcoin community regulate exchanges and third-party accounts itself? Does it need government oversight for this? Share above and comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""In the chatter about the “decentralization of all the things,” one hears about many exciting ideas: self-owning cars, peer-to-peer lending networks, and even mesh nets. The demands for replacements of existing centralized systems grows stronger by the day.\n\nBut less often discussed – the real elephant in the room – is the decentralization of arguably the most centralized system of all: government.\n\nA recent partnership of Bitnation (“the world's first virtual nation”), Horizon (the first fork of the cryptocurrency NXT), and Blocknet (an Internet of blockchains) hopes to bring the big elephant out of the corner and into the light.\n\nAnd namely for those without much access to governance services to begin with.\n\nThe Stuff That Makes the World Go Round\n\nBitnation already played host to the world's first blockchain-based wedding, as well as the first World Citizenship ID. Founder and CEO Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof says that the organization is a:\n\n“[. . .] revolutionary idea, an idea which we believe will radically change the world for the better. However, being the first in the world to challenge the nation state construct head-on through providing better services using blockchain technology, it is not always easy to implement [. . . ]. Hence, partnering with Horizon and the Blocknet provides a very solid foundation.”\n\nAnd just what role do Horizon and Blocknet play in offering this “borderless, decentralized, and voluntary” governance?\n\nThe answer is apparently twofold: it comes down to how people interact with blockchains, and how blockchains interact with each other.\n\n“Yeah, But is it Binding?”\n\nA challenge that many have run in to when trying to negotiate contracts amongst themselves comes from that very question: is our agreement “legally” binding?\n\nBut what is or is not legal changes from nation-state to nation-state, and not everyone is happy with the particular state setup of their local central government. So the question then becomes, how can you incentivize others to recognize a different form of legality, on a per-contract basis?\n\nBitnation bets that the answer is in reputation leverage:\n\n“Physical goods, and the conduct of human persons, do not occur on blockchains, and this results in a fundamental limitation of blockchain-based technology [. . .]. Horizon’s solution is to weave blockchains into the non-digital world through algorithmic reputation-scoring that sufficiently incentivizes people to honor blockchain-based agreements.”\n\nJust How Big a Chain Are We Talking About?\n\nThe size and storability of blockchains is where Blocknet comes in. The Bitcoin blockchain, for example, is already too large to be stored on a smartphone. With Bitnation seeking to store the contracts, agreements, and records of potentially all of humanity, a single blockchain won't suffice.\n\nAnd so Blocknet will act to make multiple blockchains work with each other, ensuring that no chain becomes unmanageable, and that the benefits of one chain can be transferred to another. Blocknet core member Arlyn Culwick says:\n\n“Bitnation is a groundbreaking concept, and we're very excited to provide a platform for it to be developed upon. Horizon too is a powerful Blocknet-enabled project with the highest node count of all cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin. We believe that the Blocknet, by enabling open ended inter-chain services, unlocks the full potential of blockchain-based technology.”\n\n‘Boots on the Ground’\n\nAs an undoubtedly global undertaking, Bitnation offers ambassadorships for those who want to get involved and/or have complimentary ideas of their own.\n\nWhat central government service would you personally be most excited to see replaced? Dispute resolution? Ownership titles? Something else?\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

After a few initial hiccoughs (one including a pump and dump with peak near 0.0374 BTC), Unobtanium finally seemed to have found an overlong stability between 0.0025 and 0.0095 BTC. In past few days, the cryptocurrency seems to have picked some trade flirtations after all, with its market cap and price showing a long-awaited uptrend and consecutive correction.\n\nNo Premine, No IPO, No Nonsense\n\nAs the market continues to hedge their Bitcoin trades somewhere, we at newsbtc.com try to look at every possible cryptocurrency that could play an alternative to Litecoin, Dogecoin (or to coins that have the maximum XXX-to-BTC daily trade volume). The reason we are picking Unobtanium out of a forgettable lot is simply because this cryptocurrency seems to be no less than those who are on the top charts.\n\n“There was no pre-mine not even a single block, and no IPO,” Unobtanium’s introductory post and followers preach. “There is no POS inflation to erode your stake. The launch was an undisputed fair start, with low rewards of .001 Un the first 2000 blocks to give all miners a fair shot. Unobtanium’s blockchain (aka “The Rockchain”) has been consistently mined at high difficulty since it’s launch.”\n\nAnd by noticing the sustainability of this cryptocurrency, we can at least be sure that its not in to sell some malicious scheme but to be utilized to its best. It is currently being traded at Cryptsy, MintPal, Allcrypt, Coins-e, Comkort and several other exchanges. Popular exchange service ShapeShift has also integrated Unobtanium to its services.\n\nAs its adoption picks up, we would receive a bigger picture of its stability in future. For now, Unobtanium seems to one hell of a trade-worthy cryptocurrency.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

In a sign of how austerity is changing the shape of government, officials have privately mooted a reduction of 30,000 employees in the department responsible for welfare payments and pension policy out of a full-time equivalent workforce of about 83,000, if another Conservative-led government is elected. Under Labour, which has proposed lower departmental spending cuts, the loss would be smaller although still substantial, at 20,000 posts, according to senior civil servants. DWP is Whitehall’s highest-spending department with an annual budget of more than £170bn, and has already seen its ranks slimmed by more than a quarter since the coalition took office. At its peak in 2010, when Labour was in power, the department and its associated agencies employed more than 121,000 people. The government said detailed decisions on future spending had “not been taken”, pointing out that departmental budgets for next year and beyond would be set at the next spending review. Any estimate of likely job losses was “complete speculation”, it added. However, the discussions under way in Whitehall about the prospective scale of job losses after the election offer an insight into the far-reaching impact of another five years of austerity. FT series Disunited Kingdom Ahead of one of the most unpredictable elections for decades, the FT considers how the UK is handling generational shifts in politics, business and living standards  Further reading In December’s Autumn Statement, George Osborne, chancellor, targeted an additional £10bn in Whitehall savings by 2017-18, rising to a potential £20bn by 2019-20. The likely level of attrition underlines the potential for a wave of industrial action, as staff resist losses that could have their heaviest impact in the regions outside London, where the majority of DWP staff are located. Around one in five are located in the northwest, according to the most recent set of annual civil service statistics. Scotland comes second with more than one in 10, just ahead of Yorkshire and the Humber, the north east and then London. Since the coalition’s first spending review in 2010, cutbacks have already reduced the number of officials by more than 70,000, taking the civil service to its smallest size since before the second world war. Francis Maude, cabinet office minister, has led a drive to overhaul the way Whitehall works over the past five years. More departments now share back-office functions, more services are available online and stronger central control is exercised over areas such as procurement and IT. Julian McCrae, deputy director at the IfG think-tank, said senior civil servants now accepted that further spending cuts would mean “yet another smaller version of the civil service”. However, he suggested that in order to ensure standards were maintained, or even raised, with reduced numbers, Whitehall would have to embrace even more fundamental changes in the way it worked. In part, this would mean deploying digital technology to “change the way services interact with people”. He added: “Unless you look across the very big departments, with big headcounts, and change business processes it is difficult to see the civil service successfully making further large cuts.” Some who lose their civil service posts may struggle to find alternative work, some experts believe. Paul Swinney, senior economist of the Centre for Cities think-tank, said: “Whether the private sector could fully step up to absorb all job losses in the public sector is questionable.” While London and the southeast had seen striking jobs growth in recent years, “more sluggish growth” beyond the capital and its hinterland meant this was “not a foregone conclusion”, he warned. Letter in response to this report: Department for Work and Pensions is going to need more staff, not fewer / From Mark Serwotka', 'Duncan Robinson in Brussels and James Shotter in Frankfurt MARCH 8, 2015 425 The president of the European Commission has called for the creation of an EU army in order to show Russia “that we are serious about defending European values”. In an interview with German newspaper Die Welt, Jean-Claude Juncker, who leads the EU’s executive arm, said an EU army would let the continent “react credibly to threats to peace in a member state or a neighbour of the EU”. The EU is divided on how to deal with an increasingly forthright Russia, which has been accused by Nato and the US of supplying rebel fighters in eastern Ukraine with military equipment and intelligence in the conflict against government-backed forces. Some member states, including the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, are calling for the bloc to take a much stricter line on its eastern neighbour. Large member states are also split over the idea of an EU army, with the proposals being cautiously welcomed by many senior German politicians but repeatedly dismissed outright by a succession of British governments. In an interview with German radio on Sunday, Ursula von der Leyen, Germany’s defence minister, also spoke in favour of a European army, pointing out that a brigade of Dutch soldiers was already under German command. “I think that in the Bundeswehr we would also be prepared, in certain circumstances, to put units under the control of another nation,” she told Deutschlandfunk. “This interweaving of armies, with the perspective of one day having a European Army, is, in my opinion, the future,” Mr Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, whose army consists of 900 professional soldiers, has long argued for the establishment of an EU force, making it part of his foreign policy plan during the selection process for the presidency of the commission in 2014. British prime minister David Cameron argued against his appointment, claiming that Mr Juncker was too much of a federalist for the position. Mr Cameron has repeatedly reassured eurosceptic MPs in his own party that Britain would “never support” any form of EU army. Responding to Mr Juncker’s comments on Sunday, a government spokeswoman said: “Our position is crystal clear that defence is a national, not an EU responsibility and that there is no prospect of that position changing and no prospect of a European army.” Some MEPs defended the idea, arguing that such an army should be controlled by the European Parliament. “I support Juncker in building an EU army if it means the termination of all EU member states’ armies and is controlled by the European Parliament,” tweeted Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German Green MEP. But eurosceptic parties criticised the suggestion. Mike Hookem, a defence spokesman for the anti-EU UK Independence party, said: “A European army would be a tragedy for the UK. We have all seen the utter mess the EU has made of the eurozone economy, so how can we even think of trusting them with this island’s defence.” Mr Juncker said an EU army would “help us to develop a common foreign and security policy, and to fulfil Europe’s responsibilities in the world”. Nato was not a sufficient protection for the EU as not all EU members are part of the alliance, according to Mr Juncker.

03/09/2015,"['The bitcoin price has continued to build on recent gains, adding $15 over the last week. This represents a 6% increase over the opening price on 2nd March, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.\n\nThe week\'s biggest intra-day price swing happened early in the week, when bitcoin hit a high of $286.28, representing a gain of $19.24 from the day\'s low.\n\nTrading sessions ended in positive territory on four consecutive days, from the end of the previous week and into the first days of the week just passed. Some $50 separated the daily low at the start of the sessions and the high at the end, on 3rd March.\n\nVolume growth\n\nBitcoin price gains were supported by strong volume growth. Some 3.67 million coins changed hands on the week ended 7th March, which was a 55% increase over the previous seven-day period.\n\nBig volume gains came from Bitfinex and Bitstamp, which saw spikes of 106% and 54% respectively. Chinese exchanges Huobi and OKCoin also recorded significant increases of 95% and 83%.\n\nBTC China still leads the mainland Chinese exchanges on volume traded, just barely beating OKCoin in last week\'s trading activity. Bitfinex continues to dominate trading outside the mainland.\n\nNotably, Coinbase\'s exchange, launched in January, continues to see more coins changing hands than the ex-market leader, Bitstamp.\n\nNewsflow this week was relatively calm. One significant event was the US Marshals Service\'s third bitcoin auction, which saw more bidders take part than its last sale in December. But the number of bidders – 14 in all – remains significantly lower than the 45 who took part in the inaugural sale in June.\n\nAnother news event that could have added to positive bitcoin price sentiment was the US banking regulator\'s remarks that digital currencies could be ""revolutionary"" for the global financial system, delivered to an audience of financiers at the Institute of International Bankers.\n\nWaiting for serious liquidity\n\nMarket-watchers were still chattering about the Bitcoin Investment Trust\'s regulatory approval, which was announced last week. Arthur Hayes at derivatives exchange BitMEX teased out the nuances of the BIT offering in his weekly newsletter, calling it an ""ETF Halfway House"" rather than a true exchange-traded fund offering. The latter, such as the planned Winklevoss ETF, could bring a firehose of liquidity to the bitcoin markets.\n\nWhen BIT begins trading in the US over-the-counter markets, it will only bring liquidity to existing holders of BIT units. These holders will be able to sell their units on the newly accessible OTC markets.\n\nHowever, the trust will only directly contribute to increased bitcoin demand and liquidity if the trust creates new units for its members, an act that\'s hampered by the fact that its members are limited to wealthy, \'accredited\' investors.\n\nBy contrast, the Winklevoss ETF will link demand for its units directly to demand for actual bitcoins. Each ETF share will be worth 0.2 BTC upon listing, coins which are actually held by the Winklevoss fund. New units can be created daily, an act that will require more coins to be deposited with the trust.\n\nHayes summed it up:\n\n""BIT will have a negligible effect on liquidity and a proper ETF will have a massive impact.""\n\nWhile the BIT approval is a big step for the bitcoin markets, therefore, the real wave of liquidity required to shore up the price will only come when the Winklevoss fund – or another, more nimble issuer – hits the markets.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Kenya continues to play a perfect host to the venture-backed Bitcoin companies, which are expanding fast in the region to give the premier money transfer agencies such as MoneyGram, PayPal, and Western Union, a run for their money.\n\nIn February, the Bitcoin-based global remittance company BitPesa announced that it had raised $1.1 million in fresh funding, backed by hedge fund Pantera Capital. BitPesa expects to use the funding to penetrate deeper into the Kenyan markets, targeting small mobile payment services initially. The month also witnessed the entry of the Australian Bitcoin exchange, Igot, which expanded to Kenya following the acquisition of the local cryptocurrency exchange TagPesa. The region already boasts of M-Pesa, Airtel, Orange and other money wallets which are directly connected to the digital currencies.\n\nSuch a rush towards the sub-Saharan region can be attributed to the huge potential of the untapped cross-border payment market there. The World Bank projects $39 billion in international remittances to the countries south of the Sahara desert this year.\n\nWhile the well-known money transmitters charge exorbitant amounts, the virtual currency facilitates extremely cheap international remittances. A report by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) suggests that Africans, on an average, pay 12.3% to money transmitters to send $200 home, while Bitcoin-based companies, such as BitPesa, offer a 3% cut-rate fee on all transfers. Igot makes the scene even more competitive with a 1% flat transaction charge.\n\nAnother reason that Bitcoin has been accepted so well in Kenya is the lack of proper banking infrastructure. In some areas, where the banks do exist, the transfers are two to three times more expensive. Bitcoin offers the ‘unbanked’ and the financially excluded consumers a medium to participate in the global financial system.\n\nSo, even as the rest of the world frets about the falling value of the cryptocurrency, Kenyan residents are appreciating the low-cost money transfer method which has revolutionized their lives.', 'Note from the Author: This will be my Final Analysis article at CoinTelegraph. It was a pleasure writing for this organization but it is time move on to do some more in depth research. Please follow me on Twitter (@Tone_LLT) for continued updates and I will become more active along with providing my future affiliations in the space on my blog LibertyLifeTrail.\n\nLast Article’s Review\n\n2 Weeks Ago we concluded with the following:\n\nWe remain stubbornly bullish and will continue to do so until all our support points break down. The volume for the Chinese exchanges has been down in light of the holidays so there might be one more week of back and forth. Those that have no positions at the moment might want to do nothing and just wait for a close above the 50-Day SMA plus a higher high the following day. That would provide some real signs that there is enough momentum to take us back to US$300.\n\nTwo additional scenarios in order of higher probabilities\n\nBearish: The bearish case is actually pretty compelling at the moment. Using daily charts we have very limited support around US$220, $210 and $200, which in the bitcoin world could all be broken in a single night. Once under US$200 the situation becomes scary with open air till the resent low of US$166 and if that goes, then we can see US$100 in a hurry.\n\nBullish: There really is not much of a bullish case beyond the primary view. Once we are safely above the 50-Day SMA, there is not much stopping it till the200-Day SMA currently around US$350.\n\nEverything happened just as expected. Staying bullish for weeks hopping for higher prices eventually lead to several breakouts reaching a high of US$294 on Bitfinex. Our targets for the breakout were US$255, $285, $300 and $330. We came just shy of the 3rd target so the question we will look to answer is whether this is it for the time being or does momentum carry us over the US$300 mark?\n\nFor now we start as usual by looking at the big weekly picture.\n\nAs you can see, the weekly chart is slowly moving up to meet the bottom of the long-term trend line. This is a good sign but the fact that it is doing so extremely slowly might not bode well for when it does finally hit it. We remain bullish at this time horizon but there is nothing here indicating a major breakout any time soon.\n\nFundamentals & News\n\nNot going to focus much on individual news today and will just talk about the Bitcoin community in general and the Anarchapulco event put together by Jeff Berwick of Dollar Vigilante and host of Anarcast.\n\nThe event in Acapulco Mexico brought together an interesting crowd. It drew over 200 people and while everyone was familiar with bitcoins there was a fair number that have never had a wallet so it was great to have Roger Ver there not disappointing his stature of Bitcoin Jesus by handing out a few dollars in bitcoins to anyone who installs their first wallet. As a last minute speaking addition, Peter Todd was there to explain some of the intricacies of what is happening behind the scenes with this technology.\n\nThe majority of the conference was of course focused on freedom and liberty and while there was a lot of good speakers. Three presentations in particular really stood out in my opinion so I would definitely recommend keeping an eye these people in the years to come if you don’t know them already.\n\nOrion Martin – Sidekik App (See Anarcast Episode & Recent Appearance on Freedom’s Phoenix)\n\nPeter St. Onge – Austrian-school Behavioral Economist & Professor (See Anarcast Episode)\n\nDayna Martin – Unschooling (See Anarcast Episode)\n\nAlso here is Ernie Hancock’s overview of the event on his how Freedom’s Phoenix.\n\nMany of the presentation were recorded including both of mine so hopefully videos will begin to hit the web soon. All and all, this was an excellent and fun event and will be looking forward to attending part two if it’s in the works.\n\nAs for the general state of the Bitcoin ecosystem, I would have to say things are struggling a bit at the moment. There is still a lot of skepticism looking at the system from the outside. Almost every week another scam in the space is exposed and even thought it should be looked at as a good thing, most people and especially the media will never see it as such.\n\nThere are plenty of incentives at the moment for merchants to accept bitcoins especially when they immediately convert to local currency, but the advantages for the consumer have not yet been realized by the general public. In fact it feels like there is a massive campaign to talk Bitcoin down based on the fact that there is no one to call to reverse a transaction. This is a very dangerous way to see things and is probably the leading cause of driving users to what I consider the most dangerous company in the space “Coinbase.” Also in light of the price going down, it is hard to make an argument that bitcoin is a good store of value, which is another reason for the slow consumer adoption after hype and speculation drove prices to what is in hindsight unrealistic levels.\n\nThe reality is that Bitcoin has the potential to change the entire global landscape. In the end game, superpowers rise and fall based on economics and global confidence of the people. The endless growth of Government tacking on debts that will never be re-paid will be coming to end within our lifetimes and the system will have a complete reset. Those that see the Blockchain as a cool new payment system looking to integrate with institutions that should have been wiped out in 2008 or even 1998 when the collapse of Long Term Capital Management needed a massive bailout, just don’t see the big picture.\n\nEveryone always calls the Bitcoin purists that don’t want Government approval or recognition as naïve when, in fact, it’s the other way around. Those that are at the footsteps of Government buildings begging for permission will end up on the wrong side of history. And all those developers that do not believe in open source code and imbedded privacy are not doing what is needed to advance society, you are not doing the Blockchain world any favors when you spy on the users and anything other than taking a technological stand against the NSA is not technological progress in my book.\n\n“The Bitcoin community needs to keep an eye on the rearview mirror because while everyone is bickering over what Bitcoin should be, the Darkcoin team is actually innovating and stability along with confidence in their Blockchain is slowly growing.” --Tone Vays\n\nDaily Overview\n\nHere is the usual one-year look back using daily candles.\n\nThe Daily chart continues to flirt with the upward sloping channel. The quick burst past US$300 and new yearly highs never came, but there is still descent hope we will get there. The possibility of hitting the top of the channel is starting to get dim so at the moment we are hopping to hit that US$330-350 range and see what happens next. Most likely we will then turn and test some lows, perhaps in the low $200’s or even the low US$100’s. As stated before, it is all about confidence and if people continue to hand over their bitcoins to unproven 3rd parties and fund these fraudulent companies in the space the negative headlines will keep on coming.\n\nThe zoomed in Daily version of the same chart is looking the most optimistic of them all. Notice how we finally closed above the 50-day SMA and have stabilized there for a week. This is a great sign. The ideal situation would have been to pull back to the US$255 area and test this moving average from above, but nothing in life will ever be perfect. The probability is high that we will move up and hit that 200-day SMA currently at US$338 but still falling. Just be aware that dropping down to US$255 from these levels does not alter this view.\n\nThe Hourly chart that is usually profiled on Twitter (@Tone_LLT) continues to be a struggle. After giving multiple indications that it’s headed for that pullback to US$255 it has remained above US$270. This is slowly strengthening the short-term bullish case, but is not providing any good entries for intermediate term investors and traders. Because the 200 period SMA is moving up we would now be happy with a good bullish entry in the mid US$260’s for a chance to see ride this wave back above US$300. Perfect entries of course are rare so it’s always up to the reader and their risk tolerance as to when to enter or exit any market.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe remain bullish for the time being with an eye on our final two targets of US$300 and US$330. It always depends on how it gets there but most likely these would be good target to take some Bitcoin profits and watch the global economy unfold. There will be more merchants coming on line but the value proposition for the consumer to use bitcoins over a credit card is not yet made. This will continue to be a burden on bitcoin’s price for the time being.\n\nTwo additional scenarios in order of higher probabilities\n\nBearish: The bearish alternative begins to show its signs if the price falls under US$250-255 zone. It gets some teeth under US$223 and if we fall under US$200, it will be a very depressing spring as we wait for the EU fireworks of Greece defaulting mid summer.\n\nBullish: The primary case is already pretty bullish, but in order to start thinking about the moon, the price needs take on the 200-day SMA the same way it just did the 50-day SMA last week. Moving above the 200-day SMA, then coming back to test it in that US$330 opens the door for moves to US$400 and US$440, but without a full blown sovereign debt crisis and bond defaults, the odds of reaching these marks at the moment are pretty small.\n\nReference Point: Monday Mar 8 2:00 pm ET, Bitfinex Price US$275\n\nAbout the author\n\nTone Vays is a 10 year veteran of Wall Street working for the likes of JP Morgan Chase and Bear Sterns within their Asset Management divisions.

We can expect costly court challenges, complicated enforcement, and the risks that come with entrusting a large government bureaucracy to manage a technological problem. More competition would be a better solution—and that’s where Bitcoin could help.\n\nAs Marc Andreessen recently told The Washington Post, “The ultimate answer would be if you had three or four or five broadband providers to every house.” In such a world, Andreessen explained, “net neutrality is a much less central issue, because if you’ve got competition, if one of your providers started to screw with you, you’d just switch to another one of your providers.”\n\nBut how do you get more last-mile competitors?\n\nPeter Van Valkenburgh About Peter Van Valkenburgh is Director of Research at Coin Center, a non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies. He is a graduate of NYU Law. On Twitter: @valkenburgh.\n\n“I think you actually have the potential for that depending on how things play out from here,” Andreessen said. “You can imagine a world in which there are five competitors to every home for broadband: telcos, cable, Google Fiber, mobile carriers and unlicensed spectrum.”\n\nThat last one—using unlicensed spectrum—has been a tough nut to crack. This is actually rather strange given that we are awash in internet connectivity over unlicensed spectrum bands. I’m talking about the Wi-Fi routers in every home, apartment, coffee shop, and office across the country that surround us at all times. The problem, of course, is that all of these network on-ramps are locked.\n\nYou, your neighbors, and everyone else password-protects otherwise open wireless connections to the internet. Why? The tragedy of the commons and privacy.\n\nA homeowner who pays for broadband doesn’t want her freeloading, torrent-hungry neighbor spoiling a comfy evening with Netflix and boxed wine, especially if she’s got no way to make them share the costs. And a neighbor piggy-backing on the homeowner’s Wi-Fi, freeloading or not, doesn’t want others to see what she’s reading, watching, or Skyping.\n\nLast-mile bandwidth sits largely unused because people perceive only two possibilities: opening the connection to everyone but losing privacy and getting stuck with the check, or locking down the last mile so that only they can use it.\n\nMicropayments and encryption could provide a way out from this trade-off. Efficient micropayments, however, have not been possible before the invention of Bitcoin.\n\nThere are three steps to enable this last-mile infrastructure over unlicensed spectrum: First, encrypt the network traffic so that sharing your connection doesn’t mean seeing your neighbor’s activities. Second, charge those who would send traffic through your devices for the privilege using micropayments. Third, program these open routers to seek the fastest connection to the larger internet not only through their own wired hook-up, but through their nearby peers. Knitting all of these consumer devices together gives us a mesh network.\n\nSuch a shared infrastructure protects privacy through encryption. Individuals are paid to maintain and even improve their links in the mesh with the micropayments. And software can intelligently direct traffic through intermediate nodes that offer the best connection to an outside resource for the price.\n\nMesh participants with particularly strong connections to desirable internet destinations will earn more in micropayments as their peers seek connection through their routers. These favored participants can use some of that revenue to pay for larger data plans or even faster access.\n\nSay, for example, you’re the one apartment in the neighborhood with a super-fast connection to Netflix’s servers. Maybe you have a premium subscription from a telecom that hasn’t throttled Netflix, or—even better—maybe you’ve negotiated a wholesale fiber hookup to a Tier 1 network for your business. As the fastest connection to a desired server, you’ll earn more in micropayments from your neighbors.\n\nThe money you earn is your revenue for being a valuable part of the mesh. You are free to pocket some bitcoins, and use others to pay for the connection to the wider internet or to invest in an even faster connection and better routing hardware. Eventually, if you’re dealing with a wholesale provider or a particularly progressive telecom, payment for your uplink could also be metered and denominated in bitcoins, and traffic traveling through you from the mesh network could directly pay your provider through an intelligent, Bitcoin-accepting modem.\n\nThis scheme writ large is far better than a few neighbors sharing Wi-Fi. It could become a mesh network of hundreds or even thousands in a given area. The mesh network, taken as a whole, reduces granularity in hook-ups: it’s a neighborhood that seeks connections not a bunch of individual customers. This means that an outside infrastructure provider need only bring a pipe to the town square, rather than everyone’s home. Without the costly need to duplicate another provider’s efforts stringing connections to individual homes, we can expect more competitors offering connections to any given mesh. That means more competition and fewer opportunities for discrimination.\n\nTelecoms may balk at this plan; it’s potentially disruptive, moving their revenue model from high-margin consumer entertainment services to low-margin utility provisioning for a neighborhood. Should those companies refuse to connect to mesh networks, however, wholesale Internet providers, previously available only to large enterprise clients, may enthusiastically fill the void. Even for data, it can pay to buy in bulk, and mesh networks combined with micropayments can bring those benefits of scale to each individual peer.\n\nBitcoin and the low-transaction-costs that automated micropayments can provide are the keys to building these better markets, which will ultimately unlock net neutrality itself.', ""A bill aimed at getting the state of Utah to accept bitcoin for states services passes its first reading in the Senate.\n\nThe bill has now passed its first Senate reading having already passed through the House of Representatives with a slim majority of 38 Yes votes against 36 No's.\n\nUtah state representative Marc K. Roberts introduced the proposal, Bill H.C.R 6, to the Clerk of the House of Representatives on February 10.\n\nThe bill states in its general description that its aim is to look into how the state could accept bitcoin, specifically:\n\n“This concurrent resolution of the Legislature and the Governor proposes the creation of the Council on Payment Options for State Services to study whether and how the state could accept bitcoin as a valid form of payment.”\n\nThe wording of the bill, however means that even if the senate approves the motion on its second and third readings, then the question of whether it is feasible for the state to accept bitcoin for payment of state services remains in the hands of an investigating “Council on Payment Options.”\n\nFollowing the proposed legislation's arrival at the state's senate though, the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee have already given the bill their nod of approval by three votes in favor to one opposed. The outcome of the legislated Council on Payment Options could therefore be equally favorable.\n\nRoberts though appears to believe the benefit of Bitcoin extends beyond the idea of the state saving money on payment processing fees. The representative explains that the bill's text aim to lay out a greater vision for how the cryptocurrency could help Utah.\n\n“THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah, and the Governor concurring therein, recognizes the potential benefits that could come from the expanded use of bitcoin in the state and recognizes that the state could be a key player in promoting the use of bitcoin.”\n\nSalt Lake City based Overstock.com gets a name check in the text of the bill as an example of a bitcoin accepting business thriving in the state. The electronics distributor would be in line to save on its payment processing fees were it able to directly convert BTC sales on its website into payments for state services.\n\nUtah is one of three US states where politicians are currently fielding legislation aimed at getting the local government to accept Bitcoin payments, alongside New Hampshire, and New York.\n\nCoinTelegraph recently reported on the efforts by New Hampshire Representative Eric Schleien to pass bill HR552. Schleien's version of the proposal takes a stronger stance by avoiding the investigative council step, and heading straight to an implementation plan. Bill HR552 is worded that its focus is:\n\n“Requiring the state treasurer to develop an implementation plan for the state to accept bitcoin as payment for taxes and fees.”\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to CEO of Galactic Systems, Mike Lorrey, who ran in for a seat in the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 2014 on a similar pro-cryptocurrency platform.\n\n“I would say it's very useful as far as popular acceptance of bitcoin goes. Once the states have to accept it then the banks will be right behind. It's then that we'll see the price of bitcoin start rising again on a long-term trend.”\n\nWith the Utah bill now nearing the completion of its journey through the senate, Bitcoin could receive a legitimizing vote of confidence from the state.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The software, known as Epic Scale, hijacks a user's computing and memory power in order for the company of the same name to generate computing power to mine for bitcoin.\n\nOver 150 million users rely on uTorrent to download large torrent files, everything from academic papers to pirated movies and music. Updates downloaded between January and March 6 of this year have included Epic Scale, a bitcoin-mining program that slows all operations on normally-fast computers. A company moderator on uTorrent's forums said Sunday that after weeks of criticism, uTorrent has “paused the offer to allow time for us to do an evaluation.”\n\n“As we've discussed in the past, partner offers are one of the ways we generate revenue,” the post said, referring to BitTorrent Inc.'s partnership with Epic Scale. “Many of you already understand that this is a common model for software companies that provide products and technology for free. Our policy is that these offers are strictly optional, and we have never done a silent install; in fact we built our installer technology to make silent installs impossible.”\n\nBut the charge is that uTorrent quietly included Epic Scale in a dense update agreement that users quickly clicked through, blindly agreeing to the terms and conditions.\n\n“This is pure bloatware, just updated my uTorrent,” one user complained to TorrentFreak. “There was no notification; it just installed.”\n\n“Got this installed when [I] upgraded uTorrent,” wrote another. “When I arrived home this evening my PC, was running at full tilt and practically blowing steam. I felt like it was going to catch fire.”\n\nA uTorrent spokesman said that neither uTorrent nor BitTorrent Inc. mine for bitcoin or any other kind of cryptocurrency."", ""We all know that trying to time the market is nearly impossible. But that doesn’t mean we don’t gripe when we realize we ignored the fundamentals and missed out on a major upswing.\n\nSix years ago this week, the question heading Nouriel Roubini's weekly Forbes column — and the question on the mind of virtually every investor — was “How Low Can The Stock Market Go?”. You all remember it. On March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 fell below 700 for the first time in 12 years. Goldman Sachs published a research report warning that it could fall as low as 400, and mattresses all over America reclaimed the role of safe haven. But today, anyone who pulled out their cash in a panic is kicking themselves. That day the U.S. equities markets had hit a new low — and oh my was that a compelling time to buy.\n\nI believe Bitcoin’s recent price behavior is reminiscent of the performance of U.S. equities markets six years ago. Bear with me here. On January 16, 2015, in the wake of bitcoin closing at $172 two days earlier — having shed almost three-quarters of its value in just seven months and 46% in the first 14 days of the new year — USA Today published an article entitled, “Bitcoin is Headed for the ‘Ash Heap’”. Sound familiar?\n\nTake a look at this chart. It overlays the the 2002 low point for the NASDAQ composite index and the 2009 low point for the S&P 500 with the 2015 low point for bitcoin.\n\nAs the saying goes, buy the lows. The NASDAQ composite topped 5000 on March 2nd, up 350% from its 2002 low. The S&P 500 is up 210% from its 2009 low. And at $270, bitcoin is up 57% from just two months ago. Despite the recent rebound, the price of a bitcoin is still down 76% from it’s high, back to where it was in November 2013. But today bitcoin presents an even more compelling opportunity than it did 16 months ago.\n\nMarket prices often ignore the underlying fundamentals. Before the boom and the bust in price, Pantera developed an index to measure Bitcoin’s medium-term potential for success. We call it the BitIndex. It has always been totally independent of price.\n\nThis table compares the current value of each BitIndex component with its value in November 2013:"", 'Nowadays, we deal with computer networks all the time. We chat and talk on networks. We get information on networks and we spend our free time on networks. Perhaps we even get our food from networks. Not only do we use these networks, but we have come to fully rely on them. It’s getting tough to live these days without an internet connection and a mobile phone and at the same time these networks are becoming an integral part of our lives.\n\nCommunication mediums in a network are not generally “smart.” The network itself, like the internet, only sends packets from one end to the other without caring what these packets actually are. As Bitcoin expert, Andreas Antonopoulos explained at the “Innovation and festival of the Commons” event:\n\n“Internet is a dumb a network.”\n\nAntonopoulos uses the word “dumb” since internet’s platform TCP/IP only roles as an intermediary among nodes in the network. On the other hand, there are some centralized organizations and services who interpret these messages and create useful and sensitive data in a smart way. They can solve your problems and provide you services with a few buttons on your end while they take care of the complicated backend part.\n\nThese networks are considered to be “smart networks.” For instance, some dumb devices are able to get the weather forecasts (e.g. weather app on your phone) and this requires a smart network since your device is not able to process all of the information to obtain the given weather forecast.\n\nDuring his speech, Antonopoulos describes the two options in designing a network:\n\n“There is a question of whether to make a dumb network support smart devices or to make a smart network support dumb devices.”\n\nHe gives an example of a phone network as a smart network, which introduced so many features such as caller ID and call waiting. Therefore, in order to make the experience better, service providers could just upgrade the network rather than the users’ devices.\n\nAntonopoulos argues that smart networks have a big disadvantage in that they have to be upgraded from the center out where innovation occurs only at the center by one player (centralization) and is only integrated once a feature is needed by all the subscribers and users.\n\nThis is contrary to dumb networks where innovations occur at the edge instead of the center. This means that smart users with smart tools and devices are able to further develop it. Thus, the technology grows faster and there is a fair chance for anyone with the right knowledge to further build on these ideas.\n\n“Bitcoin is a dumb network that is supported by smart devices and it puts all the intelligence on its edge,” adds Antonopoulos.\n\nGenerally other services or applications such as online banking only allow users to log into their account and issue a transaction along with a few other features. This model is not open for improvements and does not encourage other innovative minds.\n\nBitcoin uses a simple non Turing-complete script language, which only handles some basic features. However, we have seen so many innovations (e.g. Bitcoin 2.0, smart property) and creativity in the Bitcoin space, since this open-source “dumb network” can be expanded by any creative individual(s) anywhere in the world.\n\nSo yes, Bitcoin is dumb and that’s precisely why people love it, because we are all offered the same chance and opportunity to build smart services on top of it without being hindered by the rigidness and inertia of centralized control.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Many are merely mouthpieces, printed microphones for the current ruling global elite. They tell the masses what to believe, give them ten percent of the story, from the current ruler’s purview, and then call it a day. Television, print media, cable, it’s all the same. And that’s why ad revenue, viewership, and circulations are dropping in mainstream media worldwide. The smart investment for your media time is online, alternative media, like CCN, for example. Things here will definitely be pro-Bitcoin, but at least you get the other side of the story. Which brings me to the UK’s legendary Financial Times.\n\nFinancial Times gives an expert opinion on Bitcoin’s financial future\n\nFirst things first, please, I beg of you, use this link, and go to the article on their website, “FT Predictions: the world in 2015”. It’s quite a laugh riot of typical mainstream hypocrisy and misinformation. The format dictates that “FT’s experts and commentators” give a round table type of dissertation on the current state of the financial ecosystem. Undermining the proceeding argument is their inclusion of Bitcoin within their article of 2015 financial topics of import to begin with. Bitcoin is at the bottom of the article (Saved the best for last, huh?), but I’ll pass you the direct quote from some person, a so-called “expert” that they respect enough to print, named Izabella Kaminska.\n\nWill this be the year that Bitcoin and other crypto currencies collapse?\n\n“No. There are too many deep-pocketed interests standing ready to throw good money after bad defending the cryptocurrency experiment, thus preventing an outright or dramatic collapse. Nevertheless, the chances of Bitcoin, the most popular of this new breed of self-clearing financial instruments, making it as a mainstream currency are now zero. Prices have been floundering at around $350 a coin for months, escalating losses for those who invested at last year’s $1,200 highs. Add to this a stream of high-profile scandals over the past year, such as the collapse of Tokyo-based currency exchange Mt. Gox in February, and you realise it is not a question of if but when the public loses interest in this experiment entirely.”\n\nAlso read: ECB Announces Negative Interest Rates: Bitcoin Price Rallies\n\nI ask that you use the link above and go to FT’s website to view the article because the hypocrisy of this blows my mind. To get down to Bitcoin, you have to ignore the current fiat-based economic red flags, that FT brings up themselves, as current hot button issues that need discussion.\n\nMore disturbing questions for their so-called “experts” include:\n\n“Will the European Central Bank adopt full-scale quantitative easing?” (Answer is Yes.) “Which central bank — the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England — will be the first to raise interest rates?” (They foolishly say the United States, even when Janet Yellin just stated that rates will not increase any time soon. The rates in the U.S. have been 0% for almost a decade, and The Fed knows if they raise rates, their debt-based house of cards collapses. So another example of FT’s “experts” doing their homework. Unless, FT is saying that it will be a decade before the Bank of England raises rates?)”\n\nThe ECB is into negative interest rates at several central banks, and Bitcoin is the one who doesn’t have a future? Really? Bitcoin has “zero” chance, and negative interest rates throughout Europe are a sign of a real economic future for the current fiat system?\n\nJanet Yellen is a puppet just like Ben Bernanke before her. Her job is to hold out the hope of rate increases in front of the financial markets, like you hold out a carrot on a stick in front of a jackass. Only a jackass thinks they’ll actually get the carrot on the stick. I guess this is where Financial Times’s “experts” come in? Are they really advising the public on the global economic state?\n\nA robot, or a teleprompter, can do Janet Yellen’s job. She does what she’s told, and tells people what they want to hear, not the truth, or what they need to know. What people need to know is the U.S. economic system is on a respirator. The 0% interest rates and years of Quantitative Easing are buying time before the end comes. If the current global economy, not Bitcoin, had a future, they’d be able to have an interest rate, and the ECB would be able to have a 0% interest rate, not negative rates.\n\nThis pattern of death knells for Bitcoin, economic “green chutes” for the US Dollar, and rate manipulation by central banksters makes the coming collapse so easy to forecast. While central banks battle to the bottom of the economic debt well, Bitcoin will sit on the sidelines, and watch Rome burn. Like Terrell Owens used to say “Get your Popcorn ready!”\n\nIt won’t be fun, and everyone will be hurt, to some extent, by what lies ahead. Having Bitcoin, one of the few financial lifeboats, in the coming years, should provide some solace to the prudent long-term Bitcoin investor.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Jeffrey Robinson is hardly a fan of Bitcoin (the title of his latest book, ""BitCon,"" kind of gives it away.)

03/10/2015,"['Stealth bitcoin startup 21 Inc, formerly 21e6, has announced new information about its funding history, staff members and investors, revealing it has raised $116m in fundraising over multiple rounds.\n\nIn a new interview with the Wall Street Journal, 21 CEO Matthew Pauker indicated that Andreessen Horowitz, Data Collective, Khosla Ventures, RRE Ventures and Yuan Capital are among the firms that have participated in the company’s funding rounds.\n\nDropbox CEO Drew Houston; eBay co-founder Jeff Skoll; Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi; PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel and Max Levchin; and Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus have also invested in the startup.\n\nPerhaps most notable is the involvement of Qualcomm Ventures, the venture capital subsidiary of the global semiconductor company that designs and markets wireless telecommunication products.\n\nPauker told the news source that 21 aims to leverage Qualcomm’s production capabilities to develop a suite of undisclosed products to be released in the coming months.\n\nCo-founder Balaji Srinivasan, a partner at VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, compared the ambitions of the project to the development of 56-kilobit Internet modems and wireless Internet towers, suggesting a long-term vision that helps bring bitcoin to consumer households.\n\nThe figure would top the $106.7m raised by Coinbase to date through its four public funding rounds. 21 raised $5m in venture capital in 2013 as 21e6.\n\nJob openings hint at 21\'s products\n\nThe new firm\'s website lists 18 jobs that it is seeking to fill, ranging from an \'ASIC design engineer\' to a business development executive for hardware, offering a glimpse into the startup\'s plans.\n\nThe job description for the business development role, for example, asks for candidates who want to ""conceptualise and execute the deals that will make bitcoin happen at the hardware layer"".\n\nThe ad for a \'PCB designer\' (the acronym stands for \'printed circuit board\'), wants applicants who work with teams within the company and customers outside the company on ""integrating our technology into novel bitcoin-related products"".\n\nTaking the details from the Journal article together with the job ads, 21 could be working on a hardware technology at the intersection of mobile devices and bitcoin storage, said one observer of the bitcoin sector, Antonis Polemitis.\n\nQualcomm role is key\n\nPolemitis, a managing director of investment firm Ledra Capital and a teacher of the University of Nicosia\'s online course on digital currencies, said:\n\n""If you\'re doing hardware and talking about general consumers, you\'ve got to imagine they\'re thinking of a hardware wallet. We\'re still at the level of early modems where you have to fiddle with the com ports to make them work. If you messed up then, you just couldn\'t connect to the internet, but if you mess up with bitcoin, you lose all your money. So presumably we\'re looking at some kind of simplification.""\n\nPolemitis points to Qualcomm\'s involvement as a sign that mobile technologies could be at the heart of 21\'s endeavour.\n\n""Qualcomm is primarily in mobile technologies, so maybe you could make a phone with a built-in hardware bitcoin wallet. In the same way you where Apple Pay\'s security isn\'t dependent on the user doing 27 complicated things, it\'s simply dependent on turning on your phone,"" he said.\n\nQualcomm makes the Snapdragon processors that power mobile devices from Samsung, Sony, HTC and other major manufacturers.\n\nFor Polemitis, the size of 21\'s fundraising total also suggests that development of the bitcoin ecosystem is continuing in earnest.\n\nHe said:\n\n""This is a pretty confident bet on the bitcoin space ... you now have a core group of capital providers who are absolutely sold that this is going to be a huge area of development over the next 20 years.

Two winning bidders took home the bulk of the Bitcoin, with one anonymous participant winning 27,000 Bitcoin and the another winning 20,000 Bitcoin, according to USMS spokesperson Lynzey Donahue. A third winner took home just 3,000 Bitcoins.\n\nThe USMS would not comment on the price of the winning bids. At current market value, the three winners\' Bitcoin is worth $8 million, $5.9 million, and $0.9 million, respectively.\n\nThis third auction drew 14 registered bidders who placed a total of 34 bids for 50,000 Bitcoins seized from Ross Ulbricht\'s computer, an uptick in participation from the last Bitcoin auction. Held in December, that auction only drew 11 bidders who made 27 bids. Neither come close to the first Silk Road Bitcoin auction in which 45 bidders made 63 bids.\n\nFor now, the identities of the winners remain a mystery, and the USMS is not releasing any information. ""We only confirmed winners\' names in the past if they voluntarily came forward,"" Donahue explained. Because they revealed themselves, we know who won the first two auctions. Venture capitalist Tim Draper took home all 30,000 Bitcoins in the first auction. In the second auction, Draper won just 2,000 Bitcoins, while Bitcoin Investment Trust won the remaining 48,000 Bitcoins.\n\nThe government now has only 50,000 Bitcoins to go before it will have auctioned off all the Bitcoin seized during the take-down of the Silk Road in October 2013. Ulbricht was found guilty of running the Silk Road on February 4, 2015 after a month-long trial in New York City. On Friday, his lawyers asked for a re-trial. Unless that\'s granted, Ulbricht will be sentenced on May 15, 2015.', 'Blythe Masters is now the chief executive of a bitcoin-related startup.\n\nThe former global head of commodities at JP Morgan is now the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, which ""aims to be a venue for buyers and sellers of financial assets to meet and transact, switching currencies into bitcoin in order to cut the cost and time of settlement and make use of the decentralised \'block chain\' as a secure record of transactions,"" according to the Financial Times.\n\nDetails on the venture are sparse, but the FT reports that DAH was founded by Sunil Hirani and Don Wilson last year, and currently has offices in New York, Chicago, and Tel Aviv.\n\nThe idea is that DAH ""will admit creditworthy members — such as big banks and asset managers — to trade between themselves using DAH’s technology,"" writes the FT.\n\nMasters also told the paper that she won\'t be needing regulatory approval because it\'s not ""an exchange, a custodian, or a money transmitter.""\n\nBlythe is not the first Masters to get into cryptocurrency.\n\nMasters\' ex-husband, Daniel Masters (also an ex-JP Morgan commodities trader), started a Bitcoin fund last year, although he\'s had trouble finding banks to work with it. In an interview with Newsweek last spring, he compared Bitcoin to the oil market:\n\n“The state of Bitcoin is a lot like the state of the oil market 25 years ago, where you had a lot of these transactions happening merchant to merchant, this product that everyone wanted and could use but whose prices were very, very volatile, very shaky.”\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', ""Migrant African workers are increasingly turning to bitcoin to send money home.\n\nBitPesa, a service that allows bitcoins to be transferred to Kenya and Ghana for a flat fee of 3 per cent, said its user base is growing by 60 per cent month-on-month. Elizabeth Rossiello, chief executive of BitPesa, told the BBC that a shortage of payment options in Africa is driving bitcoin use.\n\nIt’s also cheaper: that 3 per cent fee contrasts sharply with an average 12.3 per cent paid to money transmitters by Africans living abroad, according to figures by the Overseas Development Institute. The ODI said that total annual fees to money transmitters amount to $1.4 billion.\n\nIn some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, MoneyGram and Western Union control 50 per cent of the remittance market while credit cards are available to less than 3 per cent of the population. Other web solutions like PayPal are not widespread and can also be expensive. Bank transfers are no better – they can be two the three times as expensive as other countries.\n\nAfrica is fertile ground for bitcoin. It has history with mobile money services that allow users to pay for good using a mobile phone as an alternative to cash or cards. A mobile money service called M-Pesa is now so widespread in Kenya that almost 70 per cent of the volume of all national payments is made through the service.\n\nToby Shapshak, a technology journalist, said that M-Pesa has become a financial institution in its own right. “You can pay school fees, you can buy groceries, I’m told you can even bribe customs officials using MPesa. The most important thing is that you can do it on the most basic of cell phone because Africa isn’t a smart phone continent yet,” Shapshak told the Guardian.\n\nBitcoin works with this local economy. Once it is received by a transmitter like BitPesa it can be converted into M-Pesa in Kenyan shillings.\n\nWhile bitcoin is on the rise, liquidity might still be a problem. As a commodity, can also be subject to greater volatility than currencies, though remittance companies say they combat this by immediately converting transfers.\n\nTransparency can also be an issue. Bitcoin users store a record on their computer of where every bitcoin is spent that acts as a virtual ledger – but the record does not show the identity of users. “From a law enforcement perspective, the danger is that the anonymity makes it an attractive proposition for criminals to use in terms of hiding the money trail we would use to get evidence against them,” Terence Chua, Singapore's deputy public prosecutor, told the Guardian."", '<<<<<<<<a href=""cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-xt"">a href=""cointelegraph.com/news/113525/10-tips-to-create-your-own-cryptocurrency"">a href=""cointelegraph.com/news/112424/is-cointellect-a-scam"">a href=""cointelegraph.com/tags/united-kingdom"">a href=""cointelegraph.com/news/113419/new-raspberry-pi-runs-full-bitcoin-node-for-35"">a href=""cointelegraph.com/news/113809/the-future-of-bitcoin-litecoin-dogecoin"">a href=""cointelegraph.com/news/113497/4-surprising-ways-to-get-bitcoins-anonymously"">p>Surreptitious mining ware planted on user PCs by torrent site uTorrent has created a backlash and could even be behind this week’s 3000% increase in Bitcoin Wikipedia requests.\n\nuTorrent’s Epic Scale software, until recently installed on client machines to mine bitcoin as part of what uTorrent calls “a common model for software companies that provide products and technology for free,” has come under fire with users experiencing slow running and a lack of transparency.\n\nIn a blog post released Sunday, uTorrent attempted to calm the situation by issuing a form of apology, while maintaining its intentions were honorable.\n\n“We understand the concerns that have been raised about our partner offer with Epic Scale,” the post reads. “Amid user feedback, on Friday mid-day we paused the offer to allow time for us to do an evaluation.”\n\nuTorrent has a user base of around 150 million, of whom around 6% were involved in the Epic Scale issue, the service claims. The bulk of criticism has been leveled at the unobvious manner in which the supposedly optional client was put out for download, but uTorrent claims its methods were suitable.\n\n“Our policy is that these offers are strictly optional and we have never done a silent install; in fact, we built our installer technology to make silent installs impossible,” the post continues. “The offers we choose and how we present them are something we strive to get right, and we think we’ve been mostly successful over the last four years.”\n\nThe incident could well be a contributing factor to a strange phenomenon to occur this week, where the Bitcoin Wikipedia page received a roughly 3000% increase in visits over comparable periods. According to Wikitrends the exact increase has been around 2742%, ranking fourth highest for the week.\n\nThe link to the uTorrent problems has been keenly noted on Reddit. While Bitcoin’s public image is unlikely to be adversely affected by another dubious promotional campaign, uTorrent’s high profile has ignited a debate over the extent to which it is acceptable to incorporate intensive software in an unassuming manner.\n\nuTorrent has meanwhile promised to take up the issue with Epic Scale, as well as addressing individual user complaints voiced on its forums.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

But when speaking over a crackling, transatlantic Skype line, they are nearly impossible to tell apart.\n\nThe twins are gearing up for the launch of their latest project, a super-secure Bitcoin exchange called ""Gemini,"" which they announced at the end of January. Created in 2008 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that does away with central banks in favour of user-to-user transactions. Tyler and Cameron became involved in the sphere since first learning about it in 2012 (while partying in Ibiza, they say); they claim to own at least 1% of all Bitcoin in existence, and they have also invested heavily in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin is like a ""child taking its first steps,"" Tyler says, and the arrival of ""mature financial tools"" won\'t ""happen overnight."" But Gemini is intended to be one of the first of these.\n\nGemini will be a fully regulated exchange through which ordinary members of the public — and institutions — can feel confident enough to buy and sell the digital currency without fear. Right now the world of Bitcoin is like the Wild West — exchanges come and go, often disappearing with everyone\'s money inside them. Gemini will be the antidote to that, the twins hope. They are touting it as the ""Nasdaq of Bitcoin.""\n\nThey believe the digital currency — and institutions like Gemini — will one day dominate global finance.\n\nIt\'s an ambitious project, and it comes amid serious teething trouble for Bitcoin.\n\nA \'difficult, awkward stage for Bitcoin\'\n\nBitcoin had a bad start to 2015. It crashed hard, losing 30% of its value in less than a week. It dropped as low as $173 — down from $350 just a month prior and far below its peaks of over $1,000 at the start of 2014. The Winklevosses say they ""can\'t guarantee the price won\'t go lower"" but believe the prices represent a ""buying opportunity right now.""\n\nThe price is slowly crawling back — as of writing it hovers around the $290 mark. But the drop also spooked confidence in the digital currency and forced at least one Bitcoin business to halt operations because it was no longer profitable.\n\nThere has been other bad news too. Earlier in January, the UK exchange Bitstamp was hacked and $5 million worth of the virtual currency was stolen. And just weeks later, the Chinese exchange BTER reported a hack, offering up a $168,000 ransom to whoever could track down its $1.75 million worth of stolen Bitcoins. (The Hong Kong exchange MyCoin also recently closed with at least $8.1 million in investors\' funds missing, but the nature of the crime appears to be closer to an old-fashion Ponzi/pyramid scheme, rather than a sophisticated hack attack.) The slew of bad news brings back uncomfortable memories of the infamous exchange Mt. Gox. Responsible at its peak for 70% of all Bitcoin transactions, it shuttered in February 2014 with $450 million in Bitcoin (at then-current prices) missing.\n\nThis is, in the twins\' eyes, a ""difficult, awkward stage"" — but they also ""don\'t see how it gets much more awkward."" There ""is no market in America right now,"" they assert, and that\'s soon to change.\n\nInvestors seem to be taking a similar, unperturbed view of the cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin startup Coinbase announced it had raised $75 million in a Series C funding round just days after the crash at a rumoured $400 million valuation — the highest ever for the industry. The company has gone on to launch its own digital currency exchange that will compete with Gemini — though Coinbase denies the timing of its launch was motivated by the Winklevosses\' plans to launch later in 2015. ""[The] launch time was not influenced by the Winklevoss announcement,"" CEO Brian Armstrong said. ""Coinbase is launching the exchange simply because it is ready.""\n\nThe launch of BIT, a Bitcoin trust in which anyone can buy shares, has been hailed as another piece of good news. Previously, only government-accredited investors could invest in such funds. As the ""first publicly traded bitcoin investment fund,"" Brian Kelley writes for CNBC, it ""could pave the way for more stability in the price.""\n\nCriminal, untrustworthy, useless: Public perceptions of Bitcoin aren\'t great\n\nAn array of digital currency organisations have hired an ""avante garde"" advertising agency, The Wall Street Journal reports, with the intention of giving Bitcoin a PR makeover. So far, however, the news of positive developments in the ecosystem is not filtering through to ordinary people.\n\nAccording to research from Coin Center, 65.6% of the general American public ""are not familiar at all with Bitcoin,"" and just 4.7% have actually used it themselves. Of those who are aware of Bitcoin, perceptions consistently skew toward the negative. People are mistrustful. They feel it has little use. They believe it is more likely to be used by criminals.\n\nThe Winklevosses ""expect to be targeted"" by hackers — but they\'re prepared\n\nDespite these negative public perceptions, the Winklevosses remain optimistic, saying, ""America hasn\'t really come online yet"" but this won\'t ""persist forever."" Within a few months, they argue, it will be a very different story. ""There\'s much more interesting startups and initiatives that are going to come online in the next six months that are positive for price."" As the price rises and the ecosystem develops, perceptions will shift.\n\nI spoke recently with Nicholas Cary, cofounder of the Bitcoin startup Blockchain, and he echoed this. Venture capital is pouring into the ecosystem, he says, and there\'s a ""latency"" before ""you\'ll see the outcomes.""\n\nCameron and Tyler believe Gemini will be instrumental in that change. Their exchange aims to differentiate itself through its security credentials, with its blog saying the twins have aimed to ""bring together the nation\'s top security experts, technologists, and financial engineers to build a world-class exchange from the ground up with a security-first mentality."" The plan is to launch early in 2015 (contingent on getting the necessary regulatory approvals), and they say they fully ""expect to be targeted"" after Gemini opens its doors — but also that they are ""learning from mistakes of the past.""\n\nThe exchange is also partnering with a major, yet-to-be announced US bank.\n\nAn analogy for the current state of Bitcoin often used by enthusiasts — and brought up by Cameron and Tyler when I spoke to them — is the early internet. ""When email first came out I don\'t think there was a compelling argument to say you need to use this to make your life better,"" they say. ""It\'s really up to the entrepreneurs and the technologists to build the infrastructure and applications out so that it\'s super easy — and dummy-proof, so to speak — to use.""\n\nWhile some Bitcoin evangelists describe a future in which the technology totally supersedes traditional currency, the Winklevosses are more cautious. They ""don\'t think the Bitcoin will replace the dollar.""\n\nTheir vision of a mature Bitcoin frames it as more similar to a ""large blue chip stock"" — volatility all but eliminated, more liquidity in the market, with a dramatically increased market cap. The construction of basic infrastructure like regulated exchanges is framed as an essential stepping stone in the process.\n\n""There will be a future where people will use Bitcoin,"" the twins say, ""and they won\'t even know they\'re using it. At that point it\'s everywhere — it\'s a part of global finance, it\'s a part of our everyday lives. In the same way using email was very difficult and the edge of technology ... it\'s always difficult, it\'s problematic, it\'s painful to use, and we\'re at that point in Bitcoin right now. The point where we\'re beyond it is the point where people don\'t think of email as the bleeding edge of tech because it works so well everyone uses it … I think it\'s going to get to that point.\n\n""We\'ll be in a situation where the majority value transferred around the world will use the Bitcoin protocol.""\n\n\'A stagnating marketplace ... in an environment of regulatory and political uncertainty\'\n\nIn a subsequent email, I ask Tyler about a recent report put out by Juniper Research. The organisation predicts a wilderness year for digital currencies, with the value of transactions across all cryptocurrencies dropping to $30 billion in 2015 — down from $71 billion in 2014. It pins this fall on ""the combined impact of exchange collapses, Bitcoin theft, and regulatory concerns around cryptocurrency\'s role in funding dark web purchases.""\n\nIt\'s a statement that was echoed two weeks later when exchange Netagio closed its doors, citing ""the reality of a stagnating marketplace in Europe, in an environment of regulatory and political uncertainty facing bitcoin businesses.""\n\n""Judging a child taking his first steps for not being able to run a marathon is shortsighted,"" Tyler responds. ""In its current stage, Bitcoin isn\'t ready for mass adoption. But people have invested half a billion dollars into the space in the last 14 months because they realise the potential for Bitcoin to not only compete in that marathon, but to actually change the way it is run.""', 'It\'s always fun when tech entrepreneur and Singularity University Chair Brad Templeton appears on the Big Think homepage. His interviews are always filled with keen insights — not just about technology, but also about how technology shapes our lives. In today\'s featured interview, Templeton talks Bitcoin, the digital currency. Should you invest in it? No, probably not. But that doesn\'t mean it\'s not an amazing innovation that could spur further advancements:\n\n""So what Bitcoin creates is a ledger that needs no bank. And that\'s actually pretty important because if you think about what is a bank, at least as far as the money transfer and the checking and savings, not the loan part, but the financial, the moving money part of a bank, it\'s really it\'s a secure ledger.""\n\nThis is the crux of why Bitcoin is so fascinating. It\'s Disruption 101. How do you subvert banking control over currency? Create a currency that needs no bank. But this disruption stretches beyond the banks:\n\n""What the designers of Bitcoin created was a way to make a ledger that\'s secure and that everyone can trust, but that no one owns or controls. And this allows people to have money that can be free of the influence of governments, which is both bad if you\'re a government and great if you don\'t like what governments do with their monetary policies.""\n\nSo what we have here is a currency free from banks and free from governmental control. Why is that a big deal? First, Bitcoin represents yet another example in a series of triumphant innovations made possible by the free and open internet. You don\'t need to ask anyone\'s permission to develop groundbreaking new technologies via the internet. What birthed Bitcoin is the same freedom that begat Facebook and YouTube.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin is extremely efficient, so efficient that it opens opportunities that previously didn\'t exist:\n\n""It\'s designed to allow financial transactions to take place at a very low cost. But, this system that doesn\'t have anyone controlling it and thus has no one to ask permission of is a system that will allow that type of innovation to take place in the world of finance and in the world of contracts. The same kind of innovation that happened in the world of communications and interacting with other people that the internet gave us.""\n\nFinally, Templeton feels Bitcoin could completely revolutionize how we write up and enforce contracts:\n\n""The only thing people use Bitcoin for today is effectively to write checks that transfer title in some Bitcoins to another person or another secret numbered account because it\'s designed to be public in what you do, but private in terms of who\'s doing it. It actually becomes possible to do things like write a contract and say I transfer one Bitcoin to you if the following is true, like if you\'ve delivered the thing you\'re supposed to deliver to me or something like that. And so now the contracts are enforced without courts, without any other third party.""\n\nLike most examples of exponential technology — expanded bandwidth, crowdfunding, etc. — we\'ll just have to wait and see what the bright minds ""in their father\'s basements"" are going to come up with once they play with Bitcoin for a while.', 'The Isle of Man, a tiny, Celtic island between the west coast of England and Northern Ireland, is soon to pass legislation that its government hopes will help it become a true paradise for digital currencies. The island will be the first place in the world to pass a ""regulatory framework"" for the alternative payment method.\n\nThe legal framework sets legislation in place for FinTech enterprises to operate more freely and securely. It creates a government jurisdiction for the industry, which means it has a practical responsibility and authority on how the marketplace operates. The island is known for actively promoting the use of the online currency, and is favoured by startups.\n\nBitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to process transactions, and there\'s no central bank or authority. Instead, it\'s managed by a network maintained by the users. This decentralisation creates volatility: In January, Bitcoin crashed by nearly 30%. It crashed even harder in 2014, which spooked UK banks, causing them to stop working with the digital currency industry on the Island.\n\nNow, the island\'s government has come up with a stronger framework to give more support to digital currencies in such situations.\n\nThe Isle of Man is a 30-mile long island off the coast of north-west England with a population of around 85,000. Yet it has more than 170 startups, 20 of which are based around currency; is energy self-sufficient; and has a GDP of £4 billion.\n\nDigital companies make up 20% of that GDP.\n\nIndeed, the Isle of Man has established itself as a key player in the world of FinTech. It\'s a surreal juxtaposition: Although it\'s a small, largely-rural landscape, Bitcoin has taken off considerably. You\'re likely to go into a coffee shop or local pub and find someone paying for a flat white or a pint of bitter with Bitcoin. Even a taxi firm there accepts the digital currency.\n\nIt\'s a world away from the urban bustle of the London tech hub Shoreditch and Silicon Roundabout — but the same high-tech futurism is there.\n\nHead of e-commerce for the Isle of Man, Peter Greenhill, tells Business Insider that the aim is to be the most attractive place in the world for cryptocurrency companies to work from. Greenhill explains that the island\'s parliament (the longest serving in the world, he says), also safeguards businesses from online crime through its Proceeds of Crime Act 2010.\n\nIt\'s also ""is a hotbed for tech startups"" due to its tax advantages — there\'s zero corporation tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, and a low personal tax.\n\nGreenhill says the Isle of Man offers ""friendly but firm legislation"" for digital currency startups. It is essentially an offshore haven.\n\n""We have the regulations and infrastructure in place to become a world leader in digital currencies,"" Greenhill tells Business Insider. ""We already have companies coming in and setting up. We see this as the future and we want to be at the centre of development in this area.""\n\nBy 2020, Greenhill expects the industry to grow by 23%. He touts the sector to see huge economic gains from which the Isle of Man can benefit. ""FinTech is growing and we\'re a great landscape for development.""\n\nGreenhill says that leading software engineers go to the island to make use of the low taxes. He says that its attraction is bolstered further because of a cool climate, which helps with running high-power data centres. It has ultra-fast broadband services, and there\'s also a ""tight FinTech community"" with common goals to see the sector strengthen.\n\n""It\'s about offering the right environment to developers. We\'ve got more than 25 digital currency businesses based on the island"" Greenhill adds. ""We\'re a microcosm of the UK and other countries — a testing site and active experimentation lab for new technologies.""\n\nThe Isle of Man isn\'t just about digital currencies, though. It\'s a favourite of telecoms companies and was also a major part of introducing the 3G network for mobiles. It will soon be the first place on earth to trial 5G services and also boasts a big eSports community.\n\nThe island is going to launch the ""ICT University"" at the end of 2015 with tech company partners HP and Huawei. The facility will be open to up to 500 students and will act as an ""incubator"" for talent. It will work alongside UK universities and plans are being put in place to link with Canary Wharf finance/tech accelerator Level39 as an offshore partner.', 'Heartland Payment Systems, the fifth largest payment processor in the US, has signed an agreement with BitPay that will find the company referring customers to its platform.\n\nFounded in 1997, Heartland offers credit, debit and prepaid card processing services, as well as check management and payments solutions. The publicly traded company estimates it has more than 250,000 customers nationwide.\n\nStatements by the companies indicate that Heartland will seek to identify businesses and organisations that may benefit from the bitcoin payment processor’s services, then referring them to the BitPay team for more information.\n\nBitPay said:\n\n“We currently have more than 50,000 merchants accepting bitcoin payments on our platform.

03/11/2015,"[""Ms. Masters said she had talks with the Federal Reserve, New York State’s Department of Financial Services and the Bank of England about Digital Asset to determine how regulated financial institutions like banks can use the start-up’s technology. There have also been discussions about whether the start-up itself should be regulated, because it may not fit the criteria for regulation that has been proposed by the Department of Financial Services. That proposal, which is currently waiting for public comment, specifies that companies involved in trading and holding Bitcoins will be regulated. Digital Asset, however, essentially intends to provide a network that makes trading easier, Ms. Masters said.\n\nAlthough Digital Asset is focusing more on the block chain, the news that Ms. Masters, a star at JPMorgan, had joined a Bitcoin-related start-up sent ripples through the virtual currency industry. After all, many Bitcoin supporters have been waiting for someone as well known in the financial world as Ms. Masters to show an interest in the virtual currency.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAnd if anyone could bring legitimacy to Bitcoin and its technology, it might be Ms. Masters, who joined JPMorgan as a college intern about 30 years ago and, at 28, became the youngest managing director the bank had ever had. Later, she helped pioneer credit default swaps, the financial instruments that eventually helped fuel the mortgage crisis. Before leaving the bank last year, she had held a number of prominent roles, including chief financial officer of the investment bank and head of the commodities unit. She announced her intention to leave the bank last April after her commodities operations stopped performing up to expectations.\n\nSince its creation in 2009, by a programmer or group of programmers going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become a technology and financial industry phenomenon. But most Bitcoin companies lack people with any previous financial experience.\n\nWhat Ms. Masters said she hoped to bring to Digital Asset — and the Bitcoin industry as a whole — was the knowledge that came with her decades of experience in the traditional financial world.\n\n“You’ve got a lot of smart people and brilliant technologists and venture capital money flocking into this space with a vision that genuinely represents progress,” she said. “There’s a need for people like me.”\n\nShe also said she was looking forward to solving problems in the financial markets.\n\n“The scale of the opportunity is gigantic,” she said. “It’s also fun to be able to work at the cutting edge of deploying today’s amazing modern technology into worlds where it hasn’t been used yet.”"", '21 Inc., formerly 21e6, announced it had raised US$116m in venture capital, the largest investment yet accumulated by a startup in the digital currency industry.\n\n21 Inc.\'s lead backers include American Andreessen Horowitz and RRE Venture, Chinese Yuan Capital, as well as strategic investor and chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.\n\nAdditional participants include Pantera Capital, Khosla Ventures, Data Collective, as well as angel investors and tech entrepreneurs Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, co-founders of PayPal, eBay Inc. co-founder Jeff Skoll, Dropbox CEO Drew Houston, Expedia Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Zynga Inc. co-founder Mark Pincus.\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup has not yet unveiled the precise nature of its activity, and said that the secrecy around the company since its launched in 2013 was ""solely for pragmatic reasons - we didn\'t have anything to say to the world,"" co-founder and partner at VC firm Andreessen Horowitz Balaji Srinivasan, told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAccording to Marc Andreessen:\n\n""[21] is working on what they - and we - consider to be core infrastructure for mainstreaming Bitcoin.""\n\nChief executive and co-founder Matthew Pauker, remained enigmatic as well, but said that there will be ""several interesting developments over the next weeks and months"" about software and hardware products.\n\nHe further indicated that investors have ""seen a lot more detail than we\'ve talked about publicly"" and that ""there are significant new technologies and products that we\'ve kept in our back pocket.""\n\nPauker highlighted that Qualcomm\'s involvement is key, and hopes to exploit the company\'s mass-marketing and production capabilities in the development of consumer oriented products based on the blockchain.\n\nThis has led speculations that 21 Inc. might be working on products related to the ""Internet of Things,"" the general concept that smart appliances could in the future communicate with servers, networks and each other, in order to optimize their operation.\n\nSince its inception in 2013, 21e6, which takes its name from the total 21 million limited supply of bitcoins to ever be in circulation, has spurred speculation, notably in November 2013, when it was revealed that the startup had received a US$5 million funding back in June 2013.\n\nWith an additional US$116m, 21 Inc. had raised a total of US$121.05m in venture funding, surpassing Coinbase\'s US$106m and becomes the world\'s most funded digital currency startup, according to CoinDesk data.\n\nIn late-January 2015, Coinbase completed a US$75m Series C round of funding, which was then the largest amount of venture capital injected in a digital currency startup. One week after, Coinbase unveiled the first US licensed bitcoin exchange.\n\nOther well-funded digital currency-related startups include Xapo Ltd., Circle Internet Financial Ltd., as well as BitFury, which are all working in their own area of expertise to build products and services that will drive mainstream adoption.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

(Express photo)\n\nBy Meghna Malik\n\nIndia might be a strange place to launch a Bitcoin mobile wallet, given that the country does not figure on the top when it comes to the virtual currency. But Saurabh Agrawal, Mahin Gupta and Sandeep Goenka claim Zebpay is the easiest way to trade in the boundary-less digital currency created by ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ in 2009.\n\nBut Zebpay has a bit of pedigree when it comes to Bitcoins. In 2014, it was voted as the best startup to present at the CoinAgenda summit in Las Vegas.\n\nEven though the Bitcoin is now legally accepted in many countries including India, it is not an official currency yet. But, given the ease and speed of transactions that Bitcoins offer, they are slowly being accepted by more companies and people across the world. In the words of Bill Gates, Co-founder, Microsoft, “Bitcoin is a technological tour de force.”\n\n“I believe, Bitcoin is an invention greater than the Internet itself. Just as the web changed the world of publishing, Bitcoins will change the world of finance. And our mobile wallet application, Zebpay is an attempt to increase the Bitcoin market in India, ” says Sandeep Goenka, Co-founder of Zebpay.\n\nWHAT IS BITCOIN?\n\nBitcoin is an innovative payment network, a new form of digital currency (commonly known as cryptocurrency) created and held electronically. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoins are not printed or monitored by a central authority. The Bitcoin network works on the consensus of everyone who participates in it — simply put, they are the Internet’s version of money.\n\nBitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology and all transactions are collectively carried out by the network. Like gold, oil and other such commodities, the price of Bitcoins is entirely based on supply and demand, usually through bids on an exchange.\n\n“Bitcoin is an extremely interesting investment. From costing a few cents when it first gained popularity in 2010, one Bitcoin is currently worth $293, which is around Rs 18,000,” adds Sandeep Goenka.\n\nBitcoins are created and held electronically, and are decentralized. (Source: Indian Express archive)\n\nHOW DOES ZEBPAY WORK?\n\nBitcoins are traded from one electronic Bitcoin wallet, to another and are digitally signed for security. To send and receive Bitcoins, one needs a Bitcoin address and a private key, which are created using Bitcoin wallets.\n\nZebpay is a mobile wallet that helps users to easily buy, store, send and spend Bitcoin through mobile numbers. It also provides merchants a premium account with various services. Zebpay eliminates the need for complex Bitcoin addresses.\n\n“We aim at enabling people to send and receive Bitcoins just like message transactions. In the near future, we intend to offer vouchers to our users that will help them shop by directly using Bitcoins,” says Saurabh Agrawal, one of the founding members of Zebpay.\n\nBitcoins are made through a self-limiting system called Bitcoin mining. It is self-limiting, because a total of 21 million Bitcoins only will ever be allowed to exist. Approximately 11 million of these Bitcoins have already been mined, and are in current circulation.\n\nIndividuals can gain access to Bitcoins by buying them at a Bitcoin exchange, by exchanging them with other individuals or by accepting Bitcoins as payments for goods and services.\n\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App', 'Victor Hugo, author of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, famously said “All the forces in the world are not so powerful as an idea whose time has come.”\n\nPerhaps Bitcoin is just such an idea?\n\nDigital currencies are still rather new, so it’s hard to know for sure. But for all of their faults, they do seem to be catching on. In less than eight years we’ve gone from zero to nearly 600 different digital currencies.\n\nThe original digital currency, Bitcoin, still represents the bulk of the total market value, but the spread of alternatives is rather impressive. Especially considering that the world is so dominated by government-created currency. Clearly there’s a demand for some type of alternative medium of exchange—and a supply of venture capitalists eager to fill that void.\n\nRight now, two of the biggest threats to the digital currency idea are overly zealous government regulators and economists who spread misinformation.\n\nConsumers should certainly be concerned with Bitcoin-related financial risks, but that goes without saying for every aspect of commerce. People owe it to themselves to learn all they can about this monetary instrument. So I highly recommend two recent Wall Street Journal stories on Bitcoin. And, with respect to the latest piece, I strongly suggest some supplemental reading. (Aside from this column, George Selgin has an excellent post addressing a specific problem).\n\nAnyone taking me up on this offer can safely rule out some of the faulty reasons critics offer up against Bitcoin’s longevity.\n\nThese flawed ideas have popped up most recently in the new Journal story titled “Do Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin Have a Future?” The piece features two academics’ differing views, and the anti-Bitcoin prof repeats some mistakes made often by critics.\n\nThe article’s digital currency antagonist, Dr. Eric Tymoigne, argues that:\n\nBitcoins are an odd sort of commodity. They are not financial instruments. The value fluctuates widely, in line with changing views regarding the overall usefulness of the bitcoin payment system and the speculative manias surrounding such views. There is no financial logic behind bitcoins’ face value.\n\nLet’s take for granted Bitcoins are a commodity. If so, then their value–as Tymoigne uses the term–is really no different than that of stocks, corporate bonds, futures in physical commodities, or even physical commodities.\n\nAll of these items have a value that can fluctuate widely in line with all sorts of changing views. And none is really immune to speculative manias. There’s actually quite a bit of financial logic there, even if one doesn’t agree with or particularly care for the ideas.\n\nRegardless, Tymoigne lumps digital currency in with financial securities. This broad view essentially treats all monetary instruments as securities, but it’s a flawed view because not all currencies are properly classified as such. (George Selgin’s post provides an excellent explanation of this issue.)\n\nTymoigne goes on to argue:\n\nBitcoins, meanwhile, violate all of the rules of finance. There is no central issuer guaranteeing payment at face value to the bearer; in fact, there is no underlying face value, and subsequently no imputed value at maturity, which means they are completely impractical for use in servicing of debt.\n\nCompletely aside from the history of centrally issued money becoming worthless, Tymoigne’s criticism misses a crucial point. The value of money has nothing to do with any sort of face value or imputed value at maturity outside of that which people give it. What ultimately gives money value – indeed, what actually makes something money – is the fact that other people will accept it as such.\n\nWithout that acceptance, you’ve got just another good–a piece of paper, a chunk of silver, a bag of sugar, etc.\n\nWith that acceptance, though, you’ve got money even if the federal government didn’t print it and stamp a picture of George Washington on it.\n\nMany people don’t even think about this fact today, but history is pretty clear: People started using commodities as money, and governments later took that function over to increase its own revenue. (Often to finance wars.)\n\nBut throughout history, money has existed without being centrally issued at all–even in the U.S. In fact, until the 1930s U.S. Federal Reserve notes represented redeemable claims on gold. That is, each paper note could be redeemed for a known (ahead of time) quantity of gold.\n\nThese notes were centrally issued, but technically they were not money. The notes (currency) represented gold, the precious metal that was actually the money. Because consumers relied more on using notes as if they were money, the eventual delinking from gold became possible.\n\nOnce FDR ended gold redeemability, the U.S. government’s currency was effectively an I.O.U. nothing. (Technically, FDR ended it for individuals; Richard Nixon ended all official forms of redeemability internationally in 1971).\n\nSo, in spite of what Bitcoin critics seem to think, the truth is that official U.S. currency doesn’t really come with a guarantee. The government only certifies that you have its official money.\n\nYes, courts can enforce legal tender laws to force people to accept a certain amount of U.S. currency to satisfy debts, but legal tender laws could apply to any other form of money too. Even Bitcoin.\n\nThere are really only two types of faith that matter in money. First, people have to have faith that they can exchange it for something else that they want. Second, people have to believe that it won’t become so abundant that it will be worthless. (Of course, these two are related.)\n\nGovernments have typically been able to exploit only the first kind of faith by taking over an item people were already using as money. And governments have always had a rough time with the second type of faith.\n\nBitcoin’s programming can’t really “do” anything about the first type. Either people accept digital currency and use it, or they don’t. Its programming does, however, solve the second problem.\n\nIt ensures that the nominal quantity of Bitcoins will grow no higher than 21 million. There’s a predictable quantity based on a programmed rule, so there’s no risk of an over-eager central government creating too much money and inflation.\n\nMaybe digital currency’s future isn’t as a bright as it seems, but it definitely has this advantage over central banks. That’s a major point in Bitcoin’s favor.\n\nEither way, public policies should be designed so that they don’t bias the public away from using digital currencies. People should be allowed to decide for themselves whether they want to use digital currencies, and that’s really the only way we’ll find out if Bitcoin’s time has come.\n\n- Norbert J.

Symbiont will focus on fostering the symbiotic relationship between traditional financial markets and cryptographic blockchain technology.\n\n“Since we founded Counterparty over a year ago, our focus has consistently been on the creation and positioning of this technology as a solution for structural issues in the larger financial markets,” said Robby Dermody, co-founder of Counterparty and now President of Symbiont.\n\n“Symbiont is the next step in achieving that goal,” Dermody said.\n\n“We’re excited about the positive impacts blockchain adoption will have in the systems that power modern finance, and we look forward to seeing this technology put into use in a way that increases transparency, liquidity and the overall functioning of capital markets,” added Evan Wagner, co-founder of Counterparty and now Managing Director of Operations at Symbiont.\n\n“I founded MathMoney f(x) (a SenaHill Partners portfolio company) to address the severe infrastructural problems associated with the emerging math-based currency trading ecosystem,” said Smith, CEO of Symbiont. “After studying the intricacies of [the blockchain] it became clear that blockchains in general, and Counterparty specifically, could solve long-standing, previously intractable problems that exist in modern financial markets. This epiphany made the decision to join forces with the Counterparty team a logical one.”\n\n“Mark has over twenty years of experience in finance, and was one of the core people behind the creation of several large-scale trading platforms,” say the Counterparty founders on their website. “We’re all very excited about the potential positive impacts not only to Counterparty, but to the blockchain’s adoption in the systems that power modern finance.”\n\nSymbiont will be using Counterparty and other blockchain-based technologies to solve specific, identified issues in several segments of the multi-trillion dollar securities market.\n\nSymbiont’s technology platform will be based on Counterparty, but the Counterparty technology itself will remain open source. The Counterparty Foundation will remain unchanged, with both community and third-party industry voices being represented, and Counterparty co-founder Adam Krellenstein will continue to serve as chief scientist of the foundation besides his new role of Symbiont chief technology officer.\n\nCounterparty made multiple headlines in 2014. Its technology was selected as the main software backbone for a new independent stock exchange operating in bitcoin and powered by Bitcoin technology.\n\nThe new stock exchange, developed by Overstock and codenamed Medici, could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet.\n\nIt was later revealed, however, that the Medici project will include a wider variety of Bitcoin technologies, protocols and blockchains.\n\nIn November, Counterparty announced the implementation of Ethereum’s programming language on the Counterparty platform, enabling users to save and execute Turing Complete Ethereum code on the Bitcoin blockchain, without having to go through external blockchains and altcoins. In the near future, Symbiont’s team plans to upgrade Counterparty’s port of Ethereum, and make it ready for operational production.\n\nThe Counterparty software suite has matured rapidly with more than 180,000 Counterparty transactions made, often constituting a significant fraction of daily bitcoin transactions. In addition, there have been three comprehensive security audits performed on the codebase.\n\nSymbiont already has raised significant interim funding, which will be followed by a formal Series A round investment of preferred stock.', 'Coinbase is the first bitcoin company to join the Internet Association (IA), a Washington, DC public policy group that lobbies regulators on Internet freedom and innovation.\n\nLaunched in 2012, the IA boasts founding members including Amazon, eBay, Facebook and Google, alongside more than 40 general members including Airbnb, Lyft and Uber.\n\nIA CEO Michael Beckerman framed the announcement as one that will find his organisation continuing its efforts to take on issues facing all disruptive Internet startups, including bitcoin-related issues that may have a wider impact.\n\nBeckerman told CoinDesk:\n\n""The idea of an emerging internet technology would be discriminated against or couldn’t compete because of policy or regulatory issues, that is something all of our companies care about.""\n\nFor example, he compared the struggles faced by Coinbase and the bitcoin industry at large to those his firm is helping ridesharing firms and cloud companies to overcome.\n\nJohn Collins, head of government affairs at Coinbase, cited IA’s role in helping regulators adapt outdated laws as a key factor behind the company\'s decision to join the organisation.\n\n""We’re investing a lot in helping policy makers to set the policies of decentralized networks, like the bitcoin protocol,"" Collins said.

Even people who think they are smart would fall into the trap... I have rarely seen such a tactic as this in 20 years or so as a legislator.""\n\nSome of the victims met the representatives of the syndicate on the mainland or in Taiwan and even Singapore, before transferring the money.\n\nTo said he would also arrange for those victims to report the case to law enforcement agencies overseas.\n\n""There are no foreign exchange controls in Hong Kong. It is an international finance centre, but it could also be an international scam centre,"" To said, adding that the city\'s police should take the lead in the investigation.\n\nThe police said more than 80 alleged victims had come forward as of yesterday, with combined losses of HK$150 million.\n\nTo date, five people have been arrested for conspiracy to defraud, in connection with the case. They have been released on bail and are required to report to the police early next month. The commercial crime bureau is investigating.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority said bitcoins and similar virtual commodities were not regulated by the watchdog.\n\nIt urged the public to exercise extra caution when considering making transactions or investments with bitcoin.\n\nYesterday, one bitcoin was trading at US$293.', 'Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are part of a technology ""megatrend"" that could change the fundamental mechanics of transactions, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs\' equity research analysts.\n\nBitcoin, along with improved payment security, \'big data\' analytics and faster payment networks are the components of a technology trend that will disrupt the payments ecosystem, the report says.\n\nThe disruption of the $1.2tn global payments industry will be also be driven by converging trends in regulation, global demographics and the rise of markets outside the United States.\n\nThe report says:\n\n""Innovations in network technology and cryptography could change the speed and mechanics of moving money.""\n\nBitcoin will change consumer payments\n\nThe report, published yesterday, is titled The Future of Finance: Redefining The Way We Pay in the Next Decade. It\'s written by James Schneider and SK Prasad Borra, payments analysts at the bank\'s research division.\n\nIt comes as the second in a series that has already featured the rise of \'shadow banks\'.\n\nAccording to Schneider and Borra, bitcoin\'s major impact will be enabling the transfer of assets without a central clearing authority.\n\nThe large public companies that will benefit will be merchants, who will reap savings on payment costs. Firms who might lose out are traditional money-transfer firms like Western Union, Moneygram and Xoom.\n\nThe report names Coinbase, BitPay and Ripple Labs as the leading firms in the bitcoin space.\n\nBitcoin\'s impact will be felt in the field of consumer-to-consumer payments, the report says. This market includes all payments made between consumers, with examples of leading vendors being mobile wallets like Venmo and Square Cash.\n\nDisruptive entrants to the consumer payments space are limited to earning revenue from international money transfers, according to the report, a market that\'s worth $580bn. These entrants include bitcoin exchanges and the peer-to-peer platform for foreign currency exchange TransferWise.\n\nExchanges named in the report include Coinbase, itBit, Circle, Trucoin and CoinCorner.\n\nBitcoin could also play a significant role in global remittances for customers who want to use cash to begin the transfer process. The report points to Bitspark as an example of a firm that lets customers remit funds by depositing cash, bypassing the need for a bank account. Bitspark then performs the transfer by exchanging it into bitcoin.\n\nNew players could take 20% of the current $30bn consumer-to-consumer market from incumbents over the next 10 years, the analysts estimate. Newcomers will also drive fees down from a current average of 6% of the principal to 2.5%.\n\n""Distributed networks are, in principle, more secure and reliable due to their open source nature, and there is no single point of failure,"" the report notes.\n\n""Given the low transaction fees associated with ... virtual currencies, there is potential for significant dislocation in the profit pools associated with money transfer.""\n\nSignificant merchant interest in bitcoin\n\nThe Ripple network is highlighted as a bitcoin alternative that could gain acceptance among small banks. The report points to Ripple\'s partnerships with banks like Fidor, CBW Bank and Cross River Bank as evidence that the network allows these institutions to perform international money transfers without depending on large banking partners.\n\nMerchant adoption of bitcoin could rise in coming years, the report found. The analysts conducted a survey with the Electronic Transactions Association that found 23% of merchants planned to accept bitcoin within the next 24 months.\n\nThe report estimates that more than 100,000 merchants currently take bitcoin payments globally.\n\nThe analysts stress that merchant adoption of bitcoin is in its ""infancy"" and that results so far have been inconclusive. It cites Overstock.com falling well short of its bitcoin sales target last year as an example of a merchant who is not enjoying significant benefits from bitcoin payments.\n\nBut the authors also stress that it\'s too early to write bitcoin off, and that they will ""closely monitor"" merchant bitcoin-use in the coming months.\n\nThe report also noted that nearly 80% of trading volume on bitcoin exchanges is driven by trade in the yuan-bitcoin currency pair, although it did not point out that Chinese exchanges often don\'t charge fees for trading, leading to higher trading volumes.\n\nThe opportunity for bitcoin-linked companies is tiny compared to the potential gains available in other sectors identified in the report. While $6bn could accrue to firms like bitcoin exchanges operating in the consumer-to-consumer payments space, some $17bn is up for grabs in the business-to-business payments sector.\n\nIn the field of payments between businesses and consumers, $84bn could be taken by newcomers.\n\nFeatured image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

03/12/2015,"['Every day, Bitcoin the cryptocurrency and Bitcoin the technology gets more popular. When in 2011 you had to write a person from the other continent to order a pizza for you with Bitcoins, now you can do something like that in a number of major cities. In some countries like the Netherlands, the entire towns are Bitcoin-friendly (such as Arnhem, often called ‘the Bitcoin city’) now with a range of services available for those who are willing to pay with BTC. The more ways are there to spend the cryptocurrency, the more ways are there to obtain them. Let us look at some of the approaches to help you earn Bitcoins online.\n\n1. Mine your own Bitcoins\n\nThe very first way to get your own Bitcoins was through mining. In 2009, every block mined (every 10 minutes on average) brought a reward of 50 BTC to the lucky one who managed to solve the computational problem. Right now, every block brings 12,5 BTC. While the reward is still luring, there are some issues which stand in the way of earning some loot:\n\n– The hashing difficulty has grown significantly over the last years. No single equipment has enough computational power to compete for Bitcoins.\n\n– Mining has gotten unprofitable.\n\n– In hope for some reward, people are forced to unite in pools or use cloud mining services.\n\n– Even when the efforts are combined, there is still need to pay for the electricity, and the utility bills often exceed the mining reward.\n\nAll these factors make Bitcoin mining these days unprofitable. This makes us move forward to the next strategy of earning Bitcoins online.\n\n2. Do work for Bitcoins\n\nIf mining is not for you, you can search for work that you can do for Bitcoins. There are multiple services that will offer one an opportunity to work for cryptocurrency. You can find something at Coinality or by just going to /r/Jobs4Bitcoins on Reddit. Currently, you can earn Bitcoins online as a freelancer mainly, but some Bitcoin startups and companies like Overstock offer an option to get the regular payment in BTC. With greater acceptance, there will be more options to look for.\n\n3. Offer something for Bitcoins\n\nAnother way to earn Bitcoins online is to sell something for crypto. If you are keen on handmade, you can accept BTC on your ETSY page, and if you are a merchant, you can use your Bitcoin address to accept Bitcoins payment on your website. You can also hang a “Bitcoin Accepted Here” sign at your hotel, restaurant, café etc.\n\n4. Gambling and casino games\n\nIf you are searching for a simple way to earn Bitcoins online, you may try gambling. However, while it might seem to you as easy money, gaming has a number of risks which need to be taken into account. In the following article, we have outlined for you some websites worth checking out when trying out your luck: Bitcoin Gambling. We don’t guarantee that you win, which is why we strongly recommend you to play only if you have some initial capital to spend. On the other hand, who knows, maybe you will get lucky and multiply your crypto.\n\n5. Use various Bitcoin faucets\n\nWe have already mentioned gambling and faucets in a recent article. What you need to know about Bitcoin faucets is that they allow you to get a small amount of cryptocurrency in particular time spans. For example, on many Bitcoin dice websites you can get 0.0001 BTC every 5 minutes. However, to get a new portion of satoshis, you need to have a zero balance. There are other options too where you can earn ‘Bitcoin dust’ for time spent on the website (for example, when playing games). You cannot gain much here, but sometimes it can be enough to get a feeling of owning some crypto.\n\n6. Boost your trading skills\n\nA good way to make an earning with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general is to do it through trading. CEX.IO allows you buying Bitcoins with payment cards or via bank transfer, after which you can convert it to other crypto or fiat using the price volatility at your advantage. Sometimes, however, Bitcoin trading can be very similar to gambling – high risks are involved here too. In order to minimise them, you need to learn a bit about trading. You may follow our blog to get some trading tips. Meanwhile, you can start with our 3 tips for profitable trading and then explore our trading category. Just start with a little amount, and when you feel more confident, you will be able to get to bigger earnings.\n\nEarning Bitcoins online: Summary\n\nThere are quite a few ways to earn Bitcoins online, and they are all different. Some of them, such as gambling, or trading, involve risks. However, while in gambling everything depends mainly on luck, trading requires some substantial knowledge. You can stay tuned for our tips on how to not just earn your Bitcoins, but to multiply it.\n\nRegardless of what strategy you choose, you still have to find a secure place to buy, sell, and store your Bitcoins. CEX.IO has been a well-known player on the Bitcoin market since 2013, offers a user-friendly service for buying, selling, trading, and keeping Bitcoins secure. None of its users has ever experienced account funds theft, and, all in all, CEX.IO deserves to be one of the best Bitcoin services known so far.', 'AntPool, BW.com, NiceHash, CKPool and GHash.io are among a number of bitcoin mining pools and operations that have been hit by distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks in recent days.\n\nThe incidents appear to have begun in the first week of March. For example, on 11th March, AntPool owner Bitmain sent an email to customers disclosing the DDOS attacks and advising external pool users to set up failsafe pools in the event of an outage.\n\nAccording to many of the companies affected by the incidents, those behind the attacks demanded payment in bitcoin in return for stopping the attacks.\n\nBW.com alerted customers via its official blog to possible service disruptions owing to DDOS attacks, but did not say whether or not a ransom notice had been sent. Other pools took to Bitcoin Talk to warn users about the DDOS attacks.\n\nGHash.io operator CEX.io suggested that affected pools are seeing escalating DDOS threats, and said that the source of recent attacks on its pool came with increasing ransom demands.\n\nA spokesperson for CEX.io told CoinDesk:\n\n“The attack has been conducted by a hacker who has already DDOSed CEX.IO in October, 2014. Previously, he demanded 2 BTC for stopping the attack. This time, the payment has been raised to 5 to 10 BTC.”\n\nAt least one other mining pool, NiceHash, also reported sustained DDOS attacks last fall.\n\nThe alleged source of the DDOS attacks, operating under the name DD4BC, is believed to be behind a number of attacks on digital currency websites and services in the past year.\n\nIncidents tied to DD4BC include an attack last year on the digital currency exchange Bitalo that resulted in the posting of a 100 BTC bounty. Following the recent DDOS threats, Bitmain contributed an additional 10 BTC to the bounty.\n\nDisruptions likely to continue\n\nAffected pools say they have moved to boost in-house defense mechanisms in light of the attacks, but some have warned that future outages may likely occur. Bitmain said that its other services, including the cloud mining platform HashNest, may also be affected in the coming days.\n\nOperators that responded to press queries say they have refused to pay the ransoms and will continue keeping their pools open despite the risk of future DDOS attacks.\n\nSome of the pools have conceded that resolving the situation will be difficult owing to the capabilities believed to be possessed by the source of the attacks.\n\nBitmain’s Yoshi Goto noted that the attacks appear to be systematic and acknowledged that it remains unclear when the situation will be completely resolved.\n\n“It is a cat and mouse game now but we will do our best,” he said.\n\nCoinDesk will continue monitoring the developments and post updates as they become available.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

If verified, the figure would make the attack the second largest this year.\n\nIn a post on its reopened website yesterday, Bter said users will be repaid in batches using future profits and a 1,000 BTC interest-free loan from Jua.com.\n\nAn update to its Twitter page earlier today reads:\n\nMost markets are re-enabled now and we are making withdrawals work for more and more coins. — Bter.com Exchange (@btercom) March 12, 2015\n\nHowever, certain trading data, including the platform\'s bitcoin, yuan and dollar charts, appear frozen at press time.\n\nJua.com partnership\n\nPreviously, Bter had considered selling its platform to make users whole, telling CoinDesk it did not have enough funds to reimburse those affected.\n\n""Hopefully a qualified party (especially a trusted security team) will take charge of it in the future,"" a spokesperson said at the time.\n\nAlongside the 1,000 BTC loan, which will be provided in exchange for equity in Bter, Jua.com will now handle all the platform\'s cold wallet security.\n\nBter said:\n\n""Working with Jua.com, we reviewed all the security-related code on Bter completely and rebuilt the back-end, and trust all our cold wallets to our partner for specialised security storage, making a solid security foundation for Bter’s re-opening.""\n\nControl of Bter’s hot wallets, used for deposits and withdrawals, will be moved over to Jua.com gradually, the exchange added. The company, which claims to provide enterprise security and storage services for bitcoin companies, runs BW.com, currently bitcoin’s 3rd largest mining pool.\n\nCustomers willing to trust the new escrow provider with their funds will receive one-month’s free trading on the platform.\n\nMissing funds\n\nBter\'s missing funds have now been tracked to a coin mixing service, Bitcoin Fog, with the help of ""security teams and ... kind cryptocurrency enthusiasts"", the exchange said.\n\nIt is unclear whether these parties will be entitled to the 750 BTC bounty previously offered to blockchain experts willing to ""chase back"" the funds. Additionally, attempts to contact Bitcoin Fog have so far been unsuccessful, according to the exchange.\n\nAs bitcoin\'s public ledger, analysts have been using the blockchain to track and visualise the movement of funds in a number of high-profile security stories.\n\nBlockchain analyst Danno Ferrin used data from the ledger to reveal Bitstamp\'s race to protect $1.75m in bitcoin following its hack in January.\n\nAdditionally, a white-hat hacker named \'johoe\' was able to take over 267 BTC from Blockchain wallets in December after discovering a security flaw.

Since the end of WWII, it has been a privilege to be an American. Since the United States took over the Global Reserve Currency from Britain in 1944 at Bretton Woods, life couldn’t be better for an American. When you have a license to print money that everyone else in the world must use, you can do a lot of things the rest of the world can’t do.\n\nYou can create the biggest, baddest military in history. Your culture can flourish with the latest technology in automobiles, computers, sports, media, and Hollywood. You can create, in essence, the world’s most dominant empire since the Romans. For Americans, that’s generally a good thing. Not knowing what real inflation is like (the rest of the world gets that), or to have the indignity of a foreign military base built in your cities because the ruling American empire feels like it. These are things the privileged American has never had to know. Alas, all good things must come to an end. There’s a new global empire growing. It’s been slowly changing the world for the last fifty years. And now, it’s about ready to change everything forever.\n\nThe Era of the Red Dragon Begins\n\nChina, up until about 50 years ago, was a small-time player on a global scale. They have had legendary wars with Japan, but they did not have any real influence over global markets of commerce. Long story short, their ability to manufacture goods of high quality at low prices, almost exclusive land rights to mine the critical “Rare Earth Elements” (The secret ingredients that make your hybrid, cellphone, and laptop so epic), and create economies of scale in food production and manufacturing has begun to bear fruit. China is now the world’s largest economy, and given their population is four times that of the U.S., there is more where that came from.\n\nBitcoin is largely an American invention. While no one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, it is believed that Satoshi primarily spoke and worked on Bitcoin in English, resided on the west coast, and refined his protocol with the late Hal Finney over six years ago. Yet just 18 months ago, China began to get a taste of the wonders of Bitcoin, and it blew the roof off of the market, driving prices to over $1100 USD within a couple of months. Bitcoin never had that level of fervor as a new currency/investment in the U.S. because Americans have been so privileged as to have the global reserve currency as their national currency. Bitcoin is just a cute speculative investment for Americans. For anyone outside of the U.S., it can represent much, much more. The average Chinese investor quickly saw a decentralized currency not manipulated by the People Bank of China as a wonderful thing and acted on it. The average American should be just as hyped by the invention of economic freedom, but, again, there goes that privileged upbringing again.\n\nThe Chinese government got wind of the financial shift in the markets and countered, making Bitcoin persona non grata when it came to banking and regulatory authority. They have also censored Bitcoin rallies and conferences, to keep a lid on Bitcoin’s publicity and level of interest nationwide. Coupled with the Mt. Gox collapse, this started a financial market crash that only now Bitcoin is starting to recover from. This is just a taste of the power China can exert on ANY financial market within a matter of months.\n\nOddly, restrictions were either navigated around or lessened, and Bitcoin is not seen as an insurgent threat to their national currency, but an online commodity to be traded. Throughout 2014 until the current day, China has increased and maintained a massive market share in Bitcoin. According to global financial giant Goldman Sachs, currently around 80% of all Bitcoin is traded in Chinese Yuan. China has maintained more than 50% of the global Bitcoin market ever since Q4 of 2013, when Bitcoin prices exploded almost overnight. It’s like a light came on; Bitcoin was seen as available for purchase, and a stampede that would make Wal-Mart on Black Friday blush began. You can see below Bitcoin was almost exclusively a US Dollar investment from the beginning, but the US Dollar has faded fast since Chinese found out about it.\n\nAlso read: Life Inside of a Multi-Million Dollar Bitcoin Mine in China\n\nIs this level of interest and dominance a good thing for Bitcoin? You can argue yes, based upon the next section we must discuss, shortly. And having one billion people potentially gravitate towards Bitcoin is better than being dominated by a country a quarter of the size. Or no, since China is a well-established and highly restrictive totalitarian regime that makes the growing “Police State” in the U.S. look like a Cub Scout meeting. You can see a downside, since the People Bank of China, directly run and managed by the Chinese government, has dropped the hammer on Bitcoin investors and owners before. They can do it again. At least in the U.S., the government has carried a “laissez-faire” approach to Bitcoin due to corporate business interest and a need for tax revenue by the government. American greed and fascism have gone a long way in protecting Bitcoin in the West.\n\nAlso, American legislation has defended Bitcoin well. The Citizens United Case has made the legal precedent of money as a form of speech and information, which has huge ramifications for Bitcoin. If the U.S. Government wants to ban Bitcoin, they risk creating a solid legal precedent that Bitcoin is money and is a legal form of information and speech in accordance with Constitutional law and current legal constructs. Not a road any government bureaucrat wants to head down. Plus, Bitcoin is used in religious tithings as donations, and there are many American laws protecting the freedom of religion. And politicians also have little incentive to attack Bitcoin, as they can now legally get donations in Bitcoin via a judgment by the Federal Election Commission, so why close a potential long-term stream of income? Politicians love getting bought off, so Bitcoin is on pretty solid legal ground in the fifty States.\n\nBitcoin and Rare Earth Elements are just the beginning for China\n\nSo, in effect, China has taken a global leadership role, somewhat quietly, in many industries. Food production (mostly rice and noodles), manufacturing (in multiple industries), Rare Earth Element mining (around 90% of the world’s capacity), the overall #1 global economy, a leading global market buyer of many top resources like oil, steel, and concrete, and now Bitcoin. That’s quite a jump up in status in a couple of generations, but that’s all foreplay. What China is really all about is this, according to an article by Tyler Durden at Zerohedge.com.\n\nAs you can plainly see, a Renminbi is being advertised by the People’s Bank of China, which is mostly owned by the Chinese Government as the future “World currency”. Does this mean the US Dollar is in immediate peril of losing it’s cherished Global Reserve Currency status? Not exactly, as China needs to build a demand and infrastructure for the RNB to become a “global” currency. It is currently the #5 most-traded currency worldwide, when five years ago it wasn’t in the Top 10. China has successfully struck deals in Toronto, Canada, Britain, Japan and other international financial hubs to get the RMB moving globally. And considering how much of an economic force China is already, few countries will stand in their way to get over in the financial markets. Everybody needs China for something, at this point. China right now really needs this one thing to pull it all together.\n\nIn order to become the Global Reserve Currency, they need some other infrastructure, like the BRICS Development Bank, which they created with Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa last year. This will become an effective alternative to the West’s IMF and World Bank hegemony. They also need an international bank transfer system, so they are creating the China International Payment System (CIPS), which should be fully operational by year’s end. Think of it as a PayPal for central banking. Many, many nations are looking for a way off the Western-run SWIFT monopoly, and once an option arrives, many will flee to the first legitimate global competitor. Chinese super-partner Russia also is mounting a similar “Double Eagle” system, to counter the economic sanctions fostered by the U.S. and the U.K. against them, so SWIFT is under attack on multiple fronts.\n\nSo China is not-so-slowly, but surely, looking to take over the world economically, and it’s only a matter of time before they succeed. I give them two years before they can overthrow the US Dollar’s monopoly on global economic power. When, not if, the Dollar falls, life in the West will not be so privileged anymore. American mismanagement, really abuse, of the currency is the biggest factor. The arrogance, and the lack of forethought about the ramifications of their actions is the leading factor in these upcoming changes that will affect Bitcoin, fiat currency, inflation, banking, and your retirement account.\n\nEverything having to do with economics in this world will change by decade’s end. The US Dollar and every American’s bank account will suffer for all the years of “living high on the hog.” Call it economic backlash. Bitcoin is a part of that change. Bitcoin was created to decentralize the economic power of the US Dollar.\n\nIn closing, the world isn’t going to sit idly by as America runs roughshod over them at will for generations. The Red Dragon has awaken and has decided enough is enough. China growing into an economic superpower was only a matter of time. Their aspirations and ambition will come to fruition. Global Reserve Currency status only lasts about 65-70 years, on average. The US Dollar sits at almost 71 years. It’s time was running out. All good things must come to an end. You also reap what you sow. These changes are a long time coming, and the whole world is watching, and waiting.\n\nBitcoin was designed to be a part of the future of money. And now China is definitely a part of Bitcoin’s future.

Trade embargoes with the US are under review, and in their absence a Cuba could emerge which would swiftly become unrecognizable from the mysterious country with the foreboding government of the past 50 years.\n\nThe CAC proves first and foremost however that the freedoms afforded to ordinary Cubans are as restricted as before at present, and that the process of increasing awareness of Bitcoin is both laborious and dangerous.\n\n“We believe that Bitcoin has an essential role to play within the context of renewed relations between Cuba and the USA,” CAC co-founder Joisy Garcia said. “This currency would not be punished like the dollar is today; the dictatorship makes holding dollars a burden, but the introduction of Bitcoin would allow us to potentially dodge this problem.”\n\nCAC was originally founded as a branch of the Mises Institute of Cuba, whose website takes the form of a blog featuring articles critiquing the country’s regime and discussing potential outcomes of change. CAC, which this week celebrates its first anniversary, is itself still very small, operated by co-founders Garcia Martinez and Nelson Rodríguez Chartrand with the support of a handful of others at home and in the US. It is likely this offshore support that allowed the group to begin accepting Bitcoin donations in February, a move which caught the attention of mainstream media: it was, of course, the first organization in the country to have any formal ties with the digital currency.\n\n“We are immersed in educating new entrepreneurs and the general public, Bitcoin is brand new both for us and for Cubans in general, and with it come new and fascinating experiences,” Garcia explained.\n\nIn his interview with PanAm Post last month, Garcia held back from explaining exactly how the group uses Bitcoin to boost its activity with regard to converting funds to Cuban pesos. He is still bound to secrecy, but hinted at the underlying aims being facilitated by these early exercises in careful accounting.\n\n“We can't reveal much about the issues surrounding conversion, but we can tell you that Bitcoin will help our club bear fruit – later we will be able to unveil some projects we have, which are ongoing as part of the distribution of the Ludwig von Mises [Institute] digital library,” he said.\n\nGarcia is understandably discreet in his discussions, yet there is also a palpable optimism from all the club’s members, something which has no doubt not come about in haste. With regard to the future, however, in a Cuba becoming ever more dynamic thanks to the influx of international attention, there remains an understated yet equally palpable sense of doubt.\n\n“The Internet, whether the dictatorship likes it or not, is gaining ground in Cuba, so we are optimistic in thinking that Bitcoin is a viable alternative for new Cuban entrepreneurs; tourists could travel from Europe USA and so on,” Garcia added, while simply concluding, “The government is not concerned about the cryptocurrency phenomenon yet, because we are one of the least connected countries in the world.”\n\nCoinTelegraph was also fortunate to be able to reach out to US-based Fernando Villar, a supporter of the CAC’s projects who first introduced Garcia to Bitcoin. Villar is spearheading an initiative to spread awareness of Bitcoin in Cuba, with plans to capitalize on the changing scene to provide for the country the empowering financial services currently being witnessed elsewhere, notably in Kenya.\n\nHis website, BitcoinCuba, has even received attention from Roger Ver, who voiced his support for Villar’s non-profit scheme. Villar spoke further about the background to Bitcoin coming to Cuba through the efforts of both organizations, and the current atmosphere in the current, highly changeable diplomatic environment.\n\nCoinTelegraph: International relations with Cuba are now back in the limelight after renewed cooperation with the US. How do you think this will help Bitcoin in Cuba?\n\nFernando Villar: I believe with news of new diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba now is the time that Bitcoin can begin to flourish in Cuba. Part of these new negations are allowing U.S. telecommunications companies to set up equipment and other infrastructure projects needed to improve phone and Internet services on the island. Right now less than 5% of Cubans have access to the Internet which is still censored by the Castro regime and very expensive for the average citizen to afford.\n\nAlthough there are other ways that Bitcoin can be traded offline through SMS or paper vouchers, in order for Bitcoin to catch on it is essential that Cubans receive the same type of broadband access we enjoy in the US. How else can Cubans pay for services like Netflix when most don’t have credit or debit cards?\n\nCT: Do you see more opportunities to become active in the Bitcoin space now, or do the same dangers remain?\n\nFV: Although the future of Bitcoin in Cuba may be bright, at the present time it is somewhat bleak. We are talking about a country in which the vast majority of Cuban families use a government issued ration book “Libreta de Abastecimiento” for food and basic necessities. Most families rely on the black market and families around the world sending remittances for daily survival. Although these are the present issues that face most Cubans, I believe there will come a time in the next few years when their own economic freedom will become a main issue. The path to economic liberty in the 21st century is through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nCT: What are your plans for using Bitcoin? Will it be aimed at group funding or wider promotion and education etc.?\n\nFV: The way in which people can learn about the powerful effects of cryptocurrency is first done through sheer education. BitcoinCuba.org was founded with the intent to educate Cuban civil society on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Cubans are highly educated and will be able to grasp the inner workings of Bitcoin but beyond the technical aspects and understanding the blockchain, this is the time for Cubans to understand the economic freedom that bitcoins bring. Once they understand concepts like not needing a bank account, getting their full remittances from families without being heavily taxed and trading their goods or services freely without governmental interference, the idea will spread like wildfire.\n\nOur mission is to connect with groups on the island and discover ways they can start using Bitcoin now on a small scale with the limited infrastructure they currently have.\n\nCT: How are you dealing with currency conversion problems?\n\nFV: The conversion problem is the biggest test right now. The Cuban Peso (CUP) and the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) are both legal tender on the island but they are not convertible in foreign markets. CUC is pegged to the dollar and most goods are valued in that currency, but most workers in Cuba are paid in CUP. The current rates right now are 26:1. The exchanges are in the hands of the regime at this time. It’s a problem that needs to be resolved, possibly through a tertiary market were goods and services can be bought and sold exclusively through bitcoins without reliance on exchange to a Peso. These are the some of the problems BitcoinCuba has noted and are looking to find ways to resolve.\n\nCT: How would you describe the Bitcoin scene in Cuba? Is there awareness or even casual use? Has the government reacted in any particular way to the cryptocurrency phenomenon?\n\nFV: here isn’t much of a Bitcoin scene in Cuba. We found out about a sole Bitcoin miner on the island and there are some people and groups who are learning about cryptocurrencies through their own research or foreign influence but it isn’t widely known. When I contacted Joisy and the Mises Cuba club about donations, I was surprised that he had his Bitcoin wallet set up but he really didn’t understand how it worked or know the true power of Bitcoins. As I spoke to him about it, he lit up with excitement and understood the true potential.\n\nMore Cubans will understand this power of Bitcoin but they need to have the educational tools at their disposal. BitcoinCuba is working on putting together some educational material to start sharing with groups in Cuba that share the spirit of economic freedom. BitcoinCuba isn’t funded by any group or governmental organization.\n\nWe want to engage the Bitcoin community for support and donations to help us spread the message of Bitcoin in Cuba. As one of our supporters Roger Ver has said, Bitcoin will have more of a positive impact to the Cuban civil society than any diplomatic negotiation between the U.S. & Cuba.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The second auction saw the lion\'s share go to a syndicate organised by Bitcoin Investment Trust, although Draper again picked up some coins.\n\nThe third and most recent USMS auction had three winners, but only one of them has come forward so far. That\'s New York exchange itBit, which claimed 3,000 coins, the smallest tranche on the auction block.\n\nNow blockchain-watchers believe they may have identified a second winner, who claimed the largest amount of coins – 27,000 BTC – on sale.\n\nA Cumberland Mining mystery\n\nIn following the trail of the mystery winner, members of r/bitcoin unearthed a two month-old tweet from an account bearing the name \'Cumberland Mining\' that simply listed a bitcoin address. That address later received 27,000 coins from the stockpile known to be controlled by the USMS.\n\nThe Cumberland Mining Twitter account contains just one tweet, but follows five accounts, including Israeli exchange Bits of Gold, the London-based exchange Coinfloor and credit-card payments enabler Simplex. Its avatar is a picture of the character Steve Youngblood of the comedy troupe the Upright Citizen\'s Brigade.\n\nAt least two bitcoin notables among those following the Cumberland Mining account are Fred Ehrsam, the Coinbase co-founder, and Phil G Potter, a manager of the Bitfinex exchange.\n\nThe mystery deepens. A website that appears to belong to Cumberland Mining & Materials LLC reveals little information. The single-page site contains a large stock image of a mine trolley, and the only description of the company\'s activities is that it provides ""solutions for bitcoiners"". A contact email is listed.\n\nA check with Delaware\'s Department of Corporations shows that Cumberland Mining & Materials LLC was incorporated there just over a year ago, on 25th February 2014. It is listed as being resident in the United States and it is in \'good standing\', according to the state business registrar.\n\nCumberland Mining has filed no annual reports and it has paid $300 for its annual tax assessment, the standard rate the state requires from limited liability companies. The state does not require LLCs to file an annual report.\n\nMarshals transfer system\n\nIndependent analyst Danno Ferrin, who built a tool to track the movement of funds on the blockchain, has found that the Marshals Service used the same method for transferring coins to all three auction winners.\n\nThe USMS stated in auction instructions that coins would be transferred to winners in the sequence that their winning bids were received – first come, first served, in other words.\n\nIn the third auction, the first winner was itBit, the second winner won 20,000 BTC and the third winner – linked to Cumberland Mining – snagged 27,000 coins.\n\nThat method, detailed on Ferrin\'s Crypto Crumbs blog, shows the Marshals first sending a ""test"" transaction of 0.05 BTC to an address controlled by a winner.\n\nA short time later – 30 minutes in the case of the first winner and two hours for the second winner – the full amount of coins won is transferred to the winner\'s specified address.\n\nBut when it came to the third winner, believed to be Cumberland Mining, the test transaction was sent near the end of the workday, at 4:30pm on 9th March. The Marshals then apparently left for the day, only transferring the full amount of 27,000 coins the following day at 7:45am Eastern Daylight Time.\n\n\'Cumberland\' coins on the move\n\nAccording to Ferrin\'s blockchain analysis, the Cumberland Mining address began to ""peel"" coins off to be sent to other addresses.\n\nThe winnings were divided into three chunks of 2,000 BTC, 5,000 BTC and 14,000 BTC. They were broken up within hours of receiving the auction winnings from the US Marshals.\n\nThe 2,000 BTC chunk has gone to an address known to be controlled by Bitfinex for customer deposits, Ferrin told CoinDesk in an interview.\n\nThe analysis notes that 6,000 BTC was what remained after the three chunks were transferred out. This sum appeared to have the test transaction amount and other transaction fees deducted from it.\n\nFerrin believes that the Cumberland Mining address was acting on behalf of a syndicate of three winners, hence the coins being peeled off. The remainder of 6,000 BTC with the fees deducted were held by the syndicate organiser, possibly Cumberland itself.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n""Within three blocks transactions for 2,000 BTC, 14,000 BTC, and 5,000 BTC were peeled off of the awarded amount. The remaining sum of nearly 6,000 BTC was short the test transaction amount and the fees paid to receive the initial sum. Because of this I feel the 6,000 distribution remained with the administrator of the syndicate.""\n\nFerrin also noted that the transactions occurred in quick succession, taking place in three consecutive blocks.\n\n""It\'s like he had a lineup of payments to make, or a plan of where to put the bitcoin,"" Ferrin said.\n\nFerrin cautions that while he stands by his theory that the big winner in the third auction was a syndicate with up to four members, including the organiser, the transactions could also show a single winner sweeping coins to cold storage and depositing a small amount to Bitfinex.\n\n""There is a chance that this is just one winner instead of a syndicate, but the speed with which the three transactions were peeled off and the nice round numbers make it feel like they are [transactions] to specific entities that were known prior to Tuesday,"" he said.\n\nCumberland\'s professional trading links\n\nWhile little is known about Cumberland Mining\'s activities, it appears to have links with several companies in the bitcoin space. Ferrin discovered the public PGP keys of individuals with Cumberland Mining email addresses while searching for information on the company.\n\nThe keys are listed on public PGP keyservers, where individuals using the PGP email encryption system list and verify their addresses.\n\nThese records also show that the keys have been \'signed\', or had their identities verified, by executives in the bitcoin space. The public key for W. Eric Saraniecki, which has a cumberlandmining.com domain-name, and which is listed as a Cumberland Mining & Materials LLC user, has been signed by Mark Lamb, the chief executive of London-based exchange Coinfloor. It has also been signed by Shaul Kfir, the chief technology officer at Digital Asset Holdings and a former director of technology at Bits of Golds, according to Kfir\'s LinkedIn profile. Mike Paleokrassas, a senior trader at SecondMarket, is also listed among the signatories.\n\nOther individuals with Cumberland Mining email addresses appear to have histories as professional traders. A Cumberland address belongs to an individual named Chadwick Miller, for example. On Twitter, Chadwick Miller lists himself as a bitcoin enthusiast, with a link to bitcoinbank.com in his profile.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with a website called Poker Tips, Miller says he worked for a ""Chicago-based trading firm"" after graduating from Indiana University. An individual named Chadwick Miller from Indiana is listed as a political donor by the Center for Responsive Politics, which maintains an open database of donations. Miller lists DRW Trading Group as his employer.\n\nWhy \'privacy hygiene\' matters\n\nDRW Trading is the giant proprietary trading fund headquartered in Chicago. Its chief executive Don Wilson co-founded the bitcoin firm Digital Assets Holdings last year, which announced Wall Street star Blythe Masters as its chief executive yesterday.\n\nAnother signatory of Saraniecki\'s public key, Joshua Charnin-Aker, has a name that corresponds to a \'weather trader\' employed at DRW Commodities. Saraniecki himself has a name that matches a New York-based ""commodities trader"" quoted in a New York Times article about buying property in the city.\n\nCoinDesk has contacted the email listed on Cumberland Mining\'s website and the individuals listed on the keyserver for comment, but has received no response. The exception was SecondMarket, where Brendan O\' Connor, a managing director who supervises Paleokrassas, requested a phone call to state that the firm doesn\'t comment on companies it may or may not be doing business with.\n\nIf the coins were won by itBit and the mysterious Cumberland Mining, what of the 20,000 BTC that has gone to an as yet unnamed winner? Ferrin has no guesses, although he stressed the importance of not re-using bitcoin addresses to maintain transaction anonymity.\n\n""This winner had excellent \'privacy hygiene\',"" he said.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article called Simplex a brokerage.

Of the two casinos, the D Las Vegas Casino Hotel, is processing the highest number of bitcoin transactions, Stevens revealed, though he declined to disclose exact figures.\n\nBitcoin is now accepted at the front desks of the Golden Gate and the D and as well as the gift shop and three restaurants at the D, giving the latter destination the edge in terms of the number of bitcoin-accepting locations.\n\nRecalling the past year, Stevens told CoinDesk:\n\n""We’re located in the growing tech sector of downtown Las Vegas, so it seemed like the right fit and we’ve definitely seen more business as a result.""\n\nThe D also recently replaced its Robocoin bitcoin ATM with a Genmega G6000 bitcoin ATM, though Stevens declined to provide a reason for the decision.\n\nLow-cost items see boost\n\nWhile tight-lipped about the finer details, Stevens did reveal the casinos currently see the highest number of bitcoin purchases at American Coney Island, an on-site eatery that specializes in classic American fare.\n\nBitcoin is also accepted at the higher-cost dining options Joe Vicari’s Andiamo Italian Steakhouse and the D Grill.\n\nStevens believes it is American Coney Island\'s relatively low pricing that is making bitcoin purchases more common there than at the other restaurants.\n\nCommunity-driven business\n\nAnother factor in the performance of the program has been the local bitcoin community, which Stevens said frequents the properties to support the payment method.\n\nOther factors influencing the performance include the price of bitcoin, and whether any tech events are being held locally.\n\nImage via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'For the third time, open source developer, creator of BFGMiner, and founder of the Eligius mining pool, Luke-Jr, has been publicly attacked for what some view as unilateral patching of Bitcoin core packages in the Gentoo Portage repository.\n\nAt issue is the Bitcoin Core developer’s implementation of what he considers “improved spam filtering.” The commonly accepted definition of “spam” in relation to Bitcoin blocks is non-transactional data. Folks who run Bitcoin nodes, be they miners or everyday users, keep a ledger of all transactions that take place.\n\nAs part of dealing with the denial-of-service weakness inherent in an open ledger system, work has been done since version 0.3.19 to aid nodes in dealing with non-standard, oversized, double-spend, or otherwise unacceptable entries. The nature of the open protocol is that the entries can always be submitted. Whether or not mining nodes confirm them and place them into finalized blocks, and whether or not other nodes broadcast them, is another issue.\n\nIn the case of gambling sites that remit a single satoshi in order to inform the user of a loss, the transaction not only costs more than it is worth to move, but it has long been considered abusive of the collective ledger. Such uses of the network indubitably contribute to the phenomenon known as “block chain bloat.”\n\nBut Luke-Jr’s work does not explicitly prevent any transaction from taking place on the network, not any sort at all – that would be impossible to do without a full-blown fork of the block chain. Luke-Jr’s modification enables the node operator to increase their protection from being forced to forward non-transactional data.\n\nA lot of things have been said about Luke-Jr and block chain spam. In this article, I aim to illustrate points that seem to have gotten lost in the in the shuffle, as well as present exclusive comment from others intimately related to the matter.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nLuke-Jr Is Not Opposed To Gambling\n\nSome in the community have taken an anti-Catholic stance, believing that Luke-Jr’s patches were motivated by his religious beliefs. Before I get to why this is ridiculous in and of itself (imprinting a prayer onto a coinbase is no more or less acceptable than doing ASCII art or a headline, as Satoshi famously did), I’ll give a sample of the religious hatred leveled at Luke-Jr:\n\nHe’s doing this because he is extremely religious and is known for spamming idiotic religious bullshit into the blockchain. Why do people let a religious zelot idiot do important technical things i dont know. Just stick to reading your irrelevant book of bullshit and let normal people do this. – /u/indeepth0ught\n\nHere’s the problem with all of these accusations that the spam filter improvements are somehow religiously motivated – hold your breath – the Catholic church does not define gambling as strictly immoral!\n\nOn certain conditions, and apart from excess or scandal, it is not sinful to stake money on the issue of a game of chance any more than it is sinful to insure one’s property against risk, or deal in futures on the produce market. As I may make a free gift of my own property to another if I choose, so I may agree with another to hand over to him a sum of money if the issue of a game of cards is other than I expect, while he agrees to do the same in my favour in the contrary event.\n\nLuke-Jr Is Not, Technically, the Gentoo Package Maintainer\n\nGentoo, like all Linux distributions, has a lot of people involved in its development and maintenance. Many in the Reddit community have called for Luke-Jr to be “banned” from contributing to the project. This is, simply, not how it works. Anyone can modify open source software. To ban Luke-Jr from doing so — or even from contributing to the Gentoo repository in particular — would go against the nature of open source software. There are other ways to deal with unwanted patching, after all. And according to Andreas K. Huettel, Gentoo Community Relations Team Leader, Luke’s patches were changed back to non-default before the developers had even heard of the new controversy (see here and here for previous controversies). (Indeed, the changes were reverted days before the new controversy even began.) In comment to CCN, Huettel said, in part:\n\nAs can be seen from the commit log the controversial “spamfilter” or “censoring” patch was disabled by default again already long before news of the discussion reached us. I would point out one popular misconception. “Luke-Jr” is not the Gentoo maintainer of the package. He is a Gentoo user who is participating in our proxy-maintainership program and submitting code for inclusion into Gentoo. As such, there are no privileges or commit permissions that can be revoked. We will review our internal procedures to see whether improvements can be made to ensure that Gentoo policy is followed when committing materials from proxied users.\n\nThese facts notwithstanding, users called for Luke-Jr’s head, so to speak.\n\nI urge you, put your money where your mouth is: boot luke-jr from maintainers. It is not the first time he secretly implements this sort of changes. It is clearly not an honest mistake, he intentionally breaks the package. There should be zero tolerance for such actions. –/u/wk4327\n\nLuke-Jr is Not Pushing an Agenda on Bitcoin\n\nThe hyped position that goes something like this: Luke-Jr is a lunatic who wants everyone to share his beliefs; doesn’t approve of gambling and has a singular view of how things should be.\n\nIn fact, after he handed off control of the Eligius mining pool to other parties, he ran for a seat on the Bitcoin Foundation. His platform directly contradicted this recently elucidated idea that he believes Bitcoin has a moral or ideological responsibility to outside interests:\n\nMy vision for Bitcoin is pretty simple: a legal and widely utilized, decentralized replacement for fiat currencies. I’ve noticed some people are using Bitcoin as an exclusive vehicle for their own ideologies. I dislike that agenda. I’m particularly against agendas of this sort which focus on promoting tax evasion, anarchy, or other anti-government activities. These agendas increase the probability that governments will perceive Bitcoin as a threat and try to make it illegal or regulated more than necessary. While I don’t wish to police individuals from political experimentation, it isn’t something I believe Bitcoin itself should be wagered on. There are many different ideologies in the world, and I think Bitcoin can be of value to all of them for different reasons.\n\nIn the final election, he did not fare well. However, for those that think the Bitcoin Foundation is out of touch with the everyday Bitcoiner, his platform continued in a democratic tone:\n\nI also think decisions shouldn’t be centralized on the board of directors. If called upon to vote or decide on a non-trivial matter as a member of the board of directors for the Bitcoin Foundation, I intend to consult with the community before making a decision, including using polls for non-landslide cases (potentially anonymous, as long as we can ensure no sockpuppets).\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nDefault is not the Way to Do Things\n\nFor changes to make it into a final, official release version of an open source program, a lot – a lot – of due process is involved. Unlike more commercialized software production environments, there is not necessarily a single entity who is the end-all, be-all of a product.\n\nLinus Torvalds is famous for being the last stop before code makes it into the kernel, for instance. But if a particular new feature were popular enough and he continually denied it for non-technical reasons (read: philosophical), a fork would be likely to result. The other side of that is that users are always able to install custom patches on their systems – that’s the point.\n\nCommunity input is incredibly important to open source, and patching such as Luke-Jr’s is valuable. In this whole debate, Luke-Jr’s longstanding commitment to the Bitcoin community has been undervalued and, for this reason, I felt it important to clarify the preceding points.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'T-Mobile has begun accepting Bitcoins as payment for pay-as-you-go phone top-ups in Poland, and is even offering a 20 per cent bonus for those ditching cash and credit cards.\n\nThe company is one of the country’s largest mobile operators with over 15m customers, and is conducting a three-month trial with Bitcoin in partnership with Warsaw-based payments processor InPay.\n\nAs with most large companies which accept the digital currency, T-Mobile will never actually hold any Bitcoins, but instead be paid in local currency z?oty by the third party processor after each sale.\n\nCustomers opting to pay in Bitcoin will receive 20 per cent more talk-time credit than those who pay in cash.\n\nTo pay in Bitcoin a user simply sends the correct amount to T-Mobile and then receives a unique code which can be input into their mobile phone to unlock credit. No personal information on the customer is taken at the point of sale.\n\nAn increasing amount of large retailers and service companies are now accepting Bitcoin as a fast and simple payments system, with lower overhead fees than credit cards.\n\nA host of start-ups in the field offer plug-and-play technology to bring Bitcoin payment support to existing online commerce sites.\n\nIn December Microsoft started to accept Bitcoin payments, allowing customers to buy apps, games and videos from online stores with the crypto-currency. That launch was supported by payments processor BitPay.\n\nIn February Dell expanded its existing support for Bitcoin from the US to the UK.\n\nThe firm is the third largest PC seller in the world with nearly $60 billion (£39 billion) in annual sales.\n\nIt began accepting Bitcoins in the US last summer after signing a deal with payments processor Coinbase, and announced this week that it is now rolling-out the feature in the UK and Canada.\n\nUptake has been strong, according to the retailer: the biggest purchase made with Bitcoin on Dell.com so far was for a high-end PowerEdge server system which cost more than $50,000.', 'NEW YORK (InsideBitcoins) — Although JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has let it be known that he is not a fan of bitcoin as a currency, the TwoBitIdiot recently pointed out that at least three past executives from the bank have joined bitcoin companies over the past two years. Goldman Sachs is also represented in the bitcoin industry via former Executive Director Timo Schlaefer and trader Fred Ehrsam. Schlaefer is launching a bitcoin derivatives brokerage, while Ehrsam was one of the co-founders at Coinbase. Perhaps the biggest sign that Wall Street is ready to embrace bitcoin came through the New York Stock Exchange’s recent investment in Ehrsam’s Coinbase. It seems that more traditional financial institutions and Wall Street veterans are involving themselves with bitcoin every few months.\n\nWhat does Jamie Dimon think of bitcoin?\n\nJPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon has actually commented on bitcoin more than once, but he’s never had many positive things to say about the long-term prospects of the financial innovation created by Satoshi Nakamoto. During the Institute of International Finance annual membership meeting in late 2014, Dimon had this to say about bitcoin’s chances of success:\n\n“The issue I have with Bitcoin is that it’s not about the technology, it’s about governments. When people form nations, one of the first things they do is form a currency. Are regulators and governments really going to foster Bitcoin over a long period of time? I think the answer is no.”\n\n[Read More: JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon: Bitcoin Will Try to Eat Our Lunch]\n\nThis was actually a much more tame perspective on bitcoin when compared to what Dimon had told CNBC’s Andrew Ross earlier in the year. He claimed, “It’s a terrible store of value. It could be replicated over and over again.” Dimon had also shared the same regulatory concerns that he talked about at the Institute of International Finance later that year. He went as far as to say the reality of adjusting to traditional banking regulations would “probably be the end of [bitcoin.]”\n\nWhile the original comments from Dimon came on the sidelines of the 2014 World Economic Forum at Davos, the discussions related to bitcoin at the 2015 edition of the annual meeting were much more accepting of the digital currency. Whether you’re at Davos or on Wall Street it seems that opinions are beginning to shift when it comes to bitcoin — no matter what Jamie Dimon has to say.\n\nBlythe Masters joins Digital Asset Holdings\n\nEarlier this week, it was announced that former head of JPMorgan’s giant commodities unit Blythe Mathers would be joining Digital Asset Holdings — a stealthy (the bitcoin buzzword of the week) bitcoin startup based in Chicago. Not much is known about this particular startup right now, but Masters has claimed that the blockchain will be used to make the current financial system “stronger, better, and safer.” Masters had quite a storied 30-year career at JPMorgan where she helped engineer credit default swaps — also known as the financial derivatives that were an integral part of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.\n\n[Read More: Wall Street Makes a Bet on Bitcoin: NYSE Part of Historic Funding for Coinbase]\n\nIs 2015 the year bitcoin goes to Wall Street?\n\nIn addition to Masters, Circle CFO Paul Camp and an unnamed entrepreneur who is working on a — you guessed it — stealth project mentioned by TwoBitIdiot in the latest release of his Daily Bit have also had stints as JPMorgan executives in the past. This follows the recent news of the Bitcoin Investment Trust becoming the first publicly traded bitcoin fund on an OTC market and the launch of US-based Coinbase Exchange with FDIC-insured US dollar deposits. The Winklevoss Twins would also like to launch their own exchange and a bitcoin ETF on the NASDAQ as soon as possible.

03/13/2015,"['It was only a matter of time. The ultra-advanced, superior technology of the digital currency Bitcoin and it’s Blockchain public ledger system are in danger of being co-opted. The tacit compliments of the financial establishment for the Bitcoin Blockchain, not Bitcoin the currency, over the past year are starting to be followed with action. IBM, in conjunction with your centralized banking elite, have discussed plans to perpetuate the future of national currencies, like the U.S. Dollar, through their own digital fiat-currency system.\n\nA Centralized Digital Fiat Currency made by IBM\n\nThink of it as a knock-off of the Bitcoin Blockchain, only to service the central banking system and those who have become beholden to it. Bitcoin technology creates a better mouse trap, and the central bankers discuss with IBM “How do we make our funny money currency work like that?”\n\n“When somebody wants to transact in the system, instead of you trying to acquire a bitcoin, you simply say, here are some U.S. dollars,” a source familiar with the project said. “It’s sort of a bitcoin but without the bitcoin.”\n\nIn other words, take the sound money supply-and-demand principles of Bitcoin out and replace them with a digital representation of centralized fiat currency instead, that a private corporation can still manipulate. How awesome is that?\n\nKeep in mind that only preliminary discussions have been made, and nothing has been finalized. These discussions have taken place with privately-owned Federal Reserve, and other countries may also be potential suitors for this new digitized fiat currency system. The Bank of England may also be very interested in this endeavor, as they lauded the Bitcoin Blockchain in a September 2014 report. The BOE described the blockchain’s open ledger as a “significant innovation” that could transform the financial system.\n\n“These coins will be part of the money supply,” the source said. “It’s the same money, just not a dollar bill with a serial number on it, but a token that sits on this blockchain.”\n\nAlso read: Bank of England Documents Show Financial Sector Understands Bitcoin\n\nThe new system would have direct oversight by the central bank it represents, unlike Bitcoin’s decentralized system. Instead of having ledgers maintained by banks that act as a record of an individual’s transactions, this kind of open ledger would be viewable by everyone using the system. It would use an agreed-upon process for entering transactions into the system.\n\n“We are at a tipping point right now. It’s making a lot more sense for some type of digital cash in the system, that not only saves our government money, but also is a lot more convenient and secure for individuals to use,” the source said.\n\nI predict that this will be fast-tracked, but the U.S. probably won’t be the first to implement it, since it is the Global Reserve Currency. A smaller nation of less significance would be a beta-test at some point this year, and the U.S. will join the system after this year once the system proves workable and scalable. And I’m sure the marketing will sell it as a real state-of-the-art innovation (copied from Bitcoin’s true innovation) that is so cool, you’ve got to start using a “BitDollar”!\n\nCan IBM effectively knock-off Bitcoin’s Blockchain, and keep it as secure? Do you trust the private Federal Reserve to continue to manage a nation’s finances, especially after their last 100 years of track record?In modern Western society, over 95% of fiat currency is digital instead of paper, so the only question going forward is, do you want to use their fiat centralized digital money or your decentralized Bitcoins?\n\nAt least now you do have a choice. This will prove that Bitcoin is on the most righteous path. The establishment may have to follow its lead just to stay relevant. Nation-states, economically, can’t afford to be Blockbuster Video to Bitcoin’s NetFlix.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\nIf IBM made your digital fiat currency, managed by the Federal Reserve or a central bank, would you use it?

(21 is a play on the fact that that only 21 million bitcoins can be released. Coincidentally, the company was also founded 21 months ago.)\n\nThe startup is led by co-founders Balaji Srinivasan, executive chairman, and Matthew Pauker, CEO. Srinivasan is a partner at one of Silicon Valley’s most respected venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz. He joined the firm after it led a $25 million series B investment in 21 back in 2013. He\'s joining 21 full-time but will remain active at Andreessen Horowitz. Matthew Pauker previously created Voltage Security and sold it to HP.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz, Yuan Capital and RRE Ventures led the round of financing for 21. Other participants include Khosla Ventures, the co-founders of eBay, PayPal, Dropbox and Zynga. Qualcomm also owns a chunk of 21, and Pauker suggests the partnership is integral to his startup’s success.\n\nEven with its funding announced, 21 still isn’t ready to reveal its master plan for bitcoin. Investor Marc Andreessen tells WSJ that 21 is working on “core infrastructure for mainstreaming bitcoin.""\n\nAll Pauker says is to expect ""interesting developments"" from 21 in the upcoming months.', 'NEW YORK (InsideBitcoins) — One week ago, a thread popped up on bitcointalk that questioned whether someone may be attempting to surveil the bitcoin network by way of a large number of nodes that were owned by the same entity. User Evil-Knieval noted that “it is obvious that one person seems to be running hundreds of bitcoin nodes which aggressively try to connect to everyone.” Bitcoin core developer Greg Maxwell popped in on the thread and requested information related to the “naughty peers” while they were connected to Knieval’s node. After Knieval reported back to Maxwell, the bitcoin wizard admitted that “this is moderately concerning.”\n\nA sybil attack on the bitcoin network\n\nMaxwell explained, “What it looks like to me is a rather ham-fisted sybil attack trying to trick nodes into leaking private data to them.” He then went on to note that the possible attack could cause issues for certain bitcoin wallets. It’s possible that this unusual node activity could be related to issues that Breadwallet users were dealing with recently. Maxwell also noted that bitcoin does have a “degree of resistance” against sybil attacks, but the reason that these sorts of attacks usually fail is because attackers are required to obtain 100% of a victim node’s connections during more sinister activities. Since this potential sybil attack is about leaking private data, the attacker does not need to worry about gaining every last one of a victim’s connections.\n\nThe real issue with this particular attack is that a single entity with control over many nodes is attempting to connect to as many peers as possible. Connecting to a large number of peers gives the attacker a better view of what is actually happening on the network because they can attach IP addresses to more bitcoin addresses.\n\nWhat can be done about this attack?\n\nMaxwell has pointed out that there has been some slow progress in the prevention of sybil attacks recently, but he seemed more concerns with the general attitude of the bitcoin development community as a whole. He stated that interest in implementing better protections against sybil attacks has been “pretty low” outside of the core developers, and he also described his disappointment with “how few people realize how important privacy and fungibility is for bitcoin’s viability as a currency.”\n\nMadars Virza would go on to echo Maxwell’s stance on the importance of bitcoin privacy at the MIT Bitcoin Expo a day later. It was at the event put together by the MIT Bitcoin Club that Virza was able to explain the privacy issues with bitcoin and how Zerocash could be the “perfect solution.” Maxwell’s final comment on the issue — at least for now — was a reminder that users should always use Tor and a full node whenever possible if they want to maintain bitcoin privacy.\n\n[Read More: MIT’s Madars Virza: Bitcoin Privacy Issues and How Zerocash Can Help]\n\nRegulatory compliance company Chainalysis is the culprit\n\nLast night, another bitcointalk user, Cryptowatch.com, was able to figure out that Chainalysis was the entity behind one of the problematic nodes. On their website, Chainalysis claims that they “offer a service that provides financial institutions with the means to obtain regulatory compliance through real-time analysis of the blockchain . . . Chainalysis achieves this by doing sophisticated in-depth real-time transaction analysis to determine unique entities within the blockchain.”\n\nIndividuals who formerly worked at both Kraken and Mycelium are involved with Chainalysis, and I reached out to CEO Michael Grønager to confirm that they are behind the node in question. Grønager responded rather quickly by stating, “Yup — the node mentioned with the http login box is ours.” He then went on to explain that the company is collecting data related to “bitcoin transfer activity between different countries.” They plan to share this data in an upcoming blog post.\n\nI then followed up with Grønager to ask more specifically about whether or not the company was using their nodes to deanonymize transactions for their clients and/or regulatory compliance. This was Grønager’s response:\n\n“We are not trying to reveal peoples IP addresses. In doing the [research on bitcoin transfer activity between countries] we see, however, a lot of ‘strange’ nodes connecting and scanning the network all the time, so don’t expect this activity not to happen at all and bear in mind that if you for whatever reason need to hide, you should only connect to bitcoin through Tor.”\n\nA blessing in disguise\n\nAt the end of the day, this event should be viewed as a reminder that bitcoin transactions are not anonymous and far from private by default. The reality is there is still plenty of work to be done in the realm of protecting privacy in bitcoin. Getting angry at how anyone interacts with the bitcoin network is useless; it’s the base incentive structure that matters. If there are any weak spots in the protocol, it will only be a matter of time before someone tries to exploit them. Instead of yelling at the attackers, it would probably make more sense to build better defenses. When there are weaknesses in a decentralized system, there is no point in hoping that everyone will just play nice.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article claimed that two individuals from Kraken and Mycelium are involved with Chainalysis. Jan Moller has not worked at Mycelium since October. Michael Grønager is also no longer affiliated with Kraken.\n\nUpdate: I seeked further clarification from Grønager one last time on the point of whether or not they collect IP addresses for their regulatory compliance offering. This is what he had to say (formatting my own):\n\n“As for your question – no – the IP info we are collecting is not being used for our compliance offerings, and we have no [intention] of selling IP info. Also, I think it is worth stressing that e.g. blockchain.info for several years has had the practice of listing the IP address where the bc.info servers first spotted a transaction (e.g. https://blockchain.info/tx/ afcc159a5276e147dde22c8c01c993 6729fb30e67ba04c432e9c3b877e8e c19e). Enabling anyone to go in there and search for an IP address and thereby assess if that IP address has at some point been running a node (even 2 years ago) – this information could actually endanger people in countries where authorities seek to crack down on bitcoin. Again, Chainalysis will never breach peoples privacy in that way, IP adresses are not to be posted and shared that way.”\n\nI have reached out to Blockchain’s Kristov Atlas for a comment on Grønager’s statement that blockchain.info’s setup could endanger bitcoin users in certain countries with authoritarian regimes.\n\nH/t to Peter Todd for sharing the original bitcointalk thread via Reddit.\n\nYou can follow @kyletorpey on Twitter.', 'UPDATE (16th March, 15:20 GMT): This survey is now also available in Chinese and also in Spanish and in Japanese.\n\nIt’s a common observation: the bitcoin community largely consists of young, white males.

While the fundamental factors such as the support of national governments may take Bitcoin past $500, an increased number of Bitcoin thefts and scams will undo the good work and may cause irreparable damage to the investors, both potential and existing.\n\nThe Bitcoin market also has one major event coming up during the next couple of years; the halving of the block mining reward to 12.5 Bitcoins per block. At present, a successful miner is rewarded with 25 Bitcoins per block. The Bitcoin protocol halves this reward every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years). The next halving is expected to happen in 2017, or if the computational power exceeds the calculations, the probability of a 2016-halving increases considerably.\n\nIt is widely expected that fewer Bitcoins will be mined going forward as network complexity reaches a higher level. Now assuming that the digital payments’ industry expands for the next 2 years at the same rate as it has in the past, the increasing demand for the cryptocurrency amid supply moderation should lead to a spurt in prices. With the price scaling new heights, Bitcoin mining will be revitalized as the value of rewards increases, which will further push up the prices. Having this side, we must also point that extreme volatility and wide vicissitudes will continue to remain in the scene.\n\nAnother major consideration is that since only 21 million Bitcoins will ever be mined, and more than 13 million are already in circulation, the sprawling Bitcoin community is left with just a little more than 7 million Bitcoins.\n\nWith big and small businesses accepting cryptocurrency payments, and the quantity being constrained, the basic laws of economics are anticipated to play out in the favor of buyers, but not without temporary shocks!\n\nReference: Bank Of England Report: Innovations in payment technologies and the emergence of digital currencies\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

It's probably more than double the meals you will eat in your lifetime,” posted Jason King, founder of Sean’s Outpost on Facebook.\n\nThere are 1,750,000 homeless people in the United States, up 150,000 since 2013. It would take 1.9 billion meals to feed these homeless people, a staggering number from the country known for its super-sized food portions. This is the constant tide Sean’s Outpost is trying push back.\n\nSean's Outpost is the largest provider of meals to the homeless in Escambia County Florida, and has the unique distinction of being the only homeless outreach in the world primarily funded by cryptocurrency. Jason King explained in his talk “Innovation for Social Entrepreneurship in the Bitcoin Space” at The North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami the benefits of Bitcoin for charities and non-profits:\n\n“Bitcoin is significantly cheaper than credit card processing. If you think of 1.7% to 3.4% fee to process those transactions and for the right to get that money. Sean’s Outpost has raised approximately $240,000 in 20 months, we have saved $8400 just for using bitcoin instead of credit cards. $8400 is a good amount of money but to a non-profit that it is a huge amount of money. Which means that at Sean’s Outpost we were able to feed an additional 6720 meals to the homeless, simply because we took Bitcoin rather than credit cards.”\n\nKing is also developing an app with lead developer Bryce Case (YTCracker) to further help solve the hunger problem called “Outpost Everywhere”. The location-based app’s main feature will have 2 options, “give a meal” and “get a meal”, and will connect people who would like to donate a meal with the homeless. This simple function can transform how people engage with and help the homeless, and King also hopes to extend the scheme’s functionality, to include the ability to place beacons on those who have basic goods like blankets, clothes, etc. that they can donate, and the ability to tag those who need those items the most.\n\nThis is just one of King’s many projects to help the homeless both in his area and around the world. In his neck of the woods, he launched Satoshi Forest a while back. It functions as a “homeless sanctuary”, a safe place for the homeless people in the Pensacola area to come and rest, interact, and set up camp. He also has talked of creating a program to help the homeless by helping them build houses to live in. This of course is a harder task to take on and requires more time to incubate.\n\nTo donate to Sean’s Outpost, support the work of Jason King and his team and help feed the homeless, please donate to 38ccq12hPFoiSksxUdr6SQ5VosyjY7s9AU\n\nJason will be speaking at The Texas Bitcoin Conference on distributed and decentralized non-profits.\n\nSocial sharing monetizes: all proceeds from this article will go to Sean’s Outpost.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

But, while some voiced their belief that the current lapse in mainstream media attention will pass, others suggested it points to new challenges for merchant acquisition.\n\nAkif Khan, vice president of solutions strategy at Bitnet, suggested this development says little about the underlying appeal of bitcoin as a payment tool:\n\n""Over the last year, there haven’t been that many large merchants announcing that they’re accepting bitcoin – Overstock, Dell, Microsoft, Expedia, Time Inc and a few others. That’s really only one every couple of months. That will ebb and flow, so I don’t think we should read too much into having a quiet patch for a month or so.""\n\nMichael Dunworth, CEO of bitcoin processor SnapCard, echoed this optimism, indicating his belief that ""we\'ll see more [merchants] than ever before start accepting [bitcoin] this year"".\n\nThe statement is supported by findings in CoinDesk\'s most recent State of Bitcoin Report that showcase how, while slowing, the number of merchants in the ecosystem is expected to grow from 80,000 to 140,000 by the end of 2015.\n\nStill, Steve Beauregard, CEO of cryptocurrency payments gateway GoCoin, had a different take, suggesting that many merchants haven\'t yet had a positive enough experience with bitcoin for a substantial uptick in adoption to take place.\n\n""I believe merchants have been widely disappointed by the number of transactions they see in bitcoin,"" Beauregard said.\n\nHe went on to state that ""consumer adoption is the problem"", speaking out against the \'if you build it they will come\' mentality of the bitcoin ecosystem in past years.\n\nBoth BitPay and Coinbase, two of the most visible market leaders in terms of bitcoin processing, declined to comment on the state of their merchant operations.\n\nThe WordPress effect\n\nOne of the most public stories involving bitcoin merchants this year may have been the decision by web publishing giant WordPress to remove bitcoin from its checkout page.\n\nAmong the first major merchants to accept bitcoin, and an early advocate for the payment tool based on its political implications, the publishing platform has since expressed its continued desire to support the ecosystem. However, its decision was seen by many as a symbolic blow given the role it played in increasing bitcoin awareness.\n\nDunworth indicated that the event shows bitcoin won\'t always serve the needs of merchants and that the payment method might not be a one-size-fits-all solution. ""I don\'t think WordPress saw enough value having it on their platform,"" he said.\n\nKhan, however, said that the experience of one merchant is not indicative of the state of the sector.\n\n""Citing WordPress shutting down support is also a little alarmist given the subsequent announcement from them that they still intend to support it,"" Khan explained.\n\nValue proposition remains\n\nAlthough the sector has fallen into what some might call a quiet period, most respondents indicated that the underlying value proposition for merchants – that the reduced processing fees can yield cost savings – remains intact.\n\nBitnet indicated that enterprise merchants remain interested in bitcoin as a means to drive revenue, while GoCoin said the potential savings and ""cool factor"" of bitcoin are still advantages that resonate with merchants.\n\nIndustry observers have a somewhat different view. Coinbase\'s business development manager Nick Tomaino, responding to a query on the social network ZapChain, voiced his personal belief that the slowdown is the result of merchants losing the coveted ""first-mover advantage"".\n\n""A year ago, it made a big splash to be the first large company to accept bitcoin in any segment – you\'d be the first in your segment and gain thousands of loyal new customers,"" he said. ""I think we\'ll continue to see that happen in new segments, but there\'s simply fewer of those segments today than there was a year ago.""\n\nJad Mubaslat, CEO of bitcoin exchange BitQuick, put it more simply, alluding to the somewhat disappointing numbers industry merchants see after the first few months of adoption.\n\n""[There\'s] not enough added business to justify it yet,"" he said.\n\n\'Passive\' approach\n\nOne commonly cited issue was that, while some merchants have enabled bitcoin, they may not be putting in the effort to help it succeed at the level needed to produce cost savings.\n\n""We\'ll see bigger names than last year, but it won\'t just be accepting it for some areas of their checkout, it will be unique and interesting adaptations which will help increase the awareness and accessibility worldwide,"" Dunworth said.\n\nBeauregard, too, spoke to issues with how merchants have attempted to leverage bitcoin.\n\n""Most merchants have taken a passive approach to integrating bitcoin as a payment method, instead of strategically testing and optimizing checkout flows to encourage consumer adoption,"" he said.\n\nThose who have seen success, he argued, have taken steps to invest time and resources into testing their checkout and educating customers.\n\n""Merchants should have a strategic plan for digital currency and actually execute on it - not simply sign-up, integrate and expect traffic.""\n\nDunworth expressed hope that more merchants would follow the path of early market leader Overstock, which has since continued to experiment and engage with the ecosystem, or IBM, which, while not a merchant, has expressed interest in the technology.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""These big businesses are seeing advantages that extend outside of just accepting it, but really leveraging the power of the blockchain to innovate their business and make it more efficient.""\n\nOld trophy image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

One of his latest innovations is becoming the first U.S. hauler to accept bitcoin—a digital currency created in 2009—as payment for related services that he offers nationwide.\n\n“I’m fascinated with being on the latest edge of technology and I’m always trying things that are outside the box,” the president of Arwood Waste and Arwood Waste National says. “I see bitcoin as being a currency of the future.”\n\nSince Arwood added bitcoin to his billing menu last summer, at least one customer per month has taken advantage of it. In a nutshell, bitcoins are stored in a digital wallet that exists either in the cloud or on a user’s computer, according to a CNN Money primer. The wallet, the equivalent of a virtual bank account, allows users to send and receive bitcoins, buy goods or save money.\n\nArwood envisions bitcoin as one ticket to boosting his customer base. In 1984, he and his father founded Arwood Waste in Jacksonville, Fla., a trash, demolition and recycling business that now serves the Interstate 95 corridor between Brunswick, Ga., and Palm Coast, Fla. Two decades later, he expanded online and on the ground by launching Arwood Waste National, a network allowing customers in all 50 states access to garbage compactors, portable toilets and commercial and residential dumpsters.\n\nIt’s that latter audience that has been receptive to filling Arwood’s digital wallet. He’s hoping that coast-to-coast presence combined with the bitcoin bait will lure behemoths such as Google, Apple and General Motors.\n\n“I’m hoping that one day I’ll snag one of them,” Arwood says. “It might sound like I’m greedy but I just want to build a niche with these big companies that need garbage services just like everybody else.”\n\nU.S. borders are not a barrier for the 41-year-old entrepreneur. Arwood is already marketing his services in Canada and Australia, where he figures he will have an edge because bitcoin is more popular and accepted. On the international front, he wants to restrict his business to English-speaking countries because he doesn’t want to have to hire translators at his Florida call center.\n\nBitcoin transactions allow for a universal payment system, Arwood says. That saves him from the hassle of keeping up with the changing laws and rules centered around international fund exchanges.\n\nDavid Biderman of the Washington, D.C.-based National Waste & Recycling Association, says he would be surprised to find waste haulers at the vanguard of using bitcoin because the industry is so conservative.\n\nHe wasn’t at all shocked to find out that the resourceful Arwood was the lead dog.\n\n“More of our members will start to use bitcoin if it becomes a more widely accepted form of commerce,” says Biderman, general counsel and vice president of government affairs at NWRA. “It only makes sense when residential and commercial customers are comfortable with bitcoin, the same way that credit cards and payment over the Internet became more common and people become more comfortable with it.”\n\nWaste Management spokeswoman Toni Beck says her company is keeping an eye on bitcoin but “not giving it active consideration at this time because it’s a little too early to tell what role it will play in commerce.”\n\nArwood, the founder of National Garbage Man Day, embraces his iconoclasm.\n\nHe attributes his forward thinking to the early 1980s when he accompanied his father to work at a steel tank manufacturing factory and discovered that he could make money collecting and selling scrap metal destined for the garbage bin.\n\nThat fueled his fondness for experimentation and for unearthing treasure in trash. He found his marketing groove in the early 1990s when he began designing web sites for his ventures.\n\n“I’m just a little garbage guy living in a country town who has learned how to reach customers worldwide,” Arwood says with a laugh. “Every day there’s a new challenge and a new door that opens that’s unique.”', 'On Friday, Star Xu, CEO of trading platform OKCoin, published his company’s security policy in a Reddit thread.\n\n“OKCoin has decided to openly share [its] cold wallet security information. Through this transparency, OKCoin aims to assure users of the security of their funds,” the post stated.\n\nXu then encouraged members of the community to contribute feedback.\n\nHe began by outlining the company’s security design philosophy, focusing on key vulnerabilities inherent in Internet connections, USB drives and reliance on centralized management.\n\nHe went on to explain how the company’s security design protocol addressed concerns surrounding private key generation and backup, depositing bitcoin from an online hot wallet to an offline cold wallet, and retrieving bitcoin from an offline cold wallet.\n\nThe post listed key highlights of the OKCoin security protocol:\n\nThe cold wallet addresses can only hold a limited amount of bitcoin. Private keys are stored on completely offline computers. Certainty that the private key never had any contact with the Internet or USBs. Encrypted private key paper document requires offsite backup, and is controlled by different people in different places. AES private key password shall also be controlled by different people in different places, and shall not be the same person with the master of the private key. Holders of the AES private key password and those with the ability to retrieve the encrypted private key are different people and in different places. Once a private key has been used to transfer bitcoin out of the address, the address is no longer to be used again for deposits.\n\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Michael Perklin, president of the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4) and president of Bitcoinsultants Inc., commended Xu.\n\n“Having a strong security policy is one of five things that every cryptocurrency storage solution should have,” Perklin said, adding that the other four pillars include “procedures, trained personnel, secure hardware and secure software.”\n\nAccording to C4’s Cryptocurrency Security Standard matrix, it appears that OKCoin’s manifesto covers many, though not all, of the points companies need to include in their security policies to earn Level II and Level III ratings.\n\nPerklin added that by publishing its security policy, OKCoin doesn’t lose anything in terms of security. The move should, in fact, give their clients a degree of confidence.\n\n“Kudos to OKCoin for doing this,” Perklin said.', ""Name: Purse\n\nWhat it is: A peer-to-peer marketplace that matches individuals wanting to buy items on Amazon at a discount with others wanting to buy bitcoin with a credit card or via PayPal. The service claims discounts of up to 20% for bitcoin shoppers.\n\nWho’s behind it: CEO and co-founder Andrew Lee, previously an advisor for BuyBitcoin.ph and co-founder at Superior Payments Processing LLC, and co-founder and CTO Kent Liu, formerly an engineer at IBM and Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. (See the full team here.)\n\nRoger Ver and BTC China's Bobby Lee (also an adviser) are both investors in the company.\n\nCost: I was charged a £0.06 ($0.09) fee for placing an order equivalent to £6.51 ($9.82), or approximately 1%.\n\nDate launched: December 2014\n\nSummary: Purse touts hefty discounts for people shopping at Amazon via its service, but time delays and complexity ruin the user experience. Additionally, limits on discounts available for new users lower incentive to use the platform.\n\nCoinDesk rating: 2/5\n\nHow it works: The service is marketed at people who would like to purchase Amazon items with bitcoin, since the digital currency is currently not accepted by the online retailing giant.\n\nThe process is similar to other peer-to-peer marketplace such as Brawker, a site that offers discount shopping at all legitimate retailers.\n\nPurse acts as an intermediary by facilitating a user platform, bitcoin wallet and escrow for completing transactions.\n\nLet's imagine that Alice wants to buy a tablet device from Amazon and get a discount of 8%. In order to do so, she would have to create a wishlist for the item on Amazon and associate it with her delivery address.\n\nAlice would then post her wishlist on Purse, with her desired discount, and upload the cost (equivalent to £100, assuming free delivery) in bitcoin to her escrow wallet address on Purse.\n\nBob, meanwhile, would like to buy £100-worth of bitcoin with his credit card. He is prepared to pay a premium to be able to do this without having to register with a bitcoin exchange and provide ID and proof of address, thus covering Alice's 8% discount himself.\n\nBob goes on to purchase the item for Alice from Amazon using his card for £108.\n\nOnce the item has been delivered to Alice's address, she notifies the Purse platform and her bitcoin is released from escrow and arrives in Bob's wallet.\n\nThis way, both customers have a need fulfilled by Purse's service.\n\nThe company makes revenue by charging both parties a small fee.\n\nSee the company's explanatory video below:\n\nPurse Promo Video from PurseIO on Vimeo.\n\nUsing the service\n\nRegistering\n\nPurse requires users to have an Amazon account.\n\nTo register on Purse, consumers are required to provide a user name or email address and a password.\n\nOnce the user has signed up to Purse, he or she will have to create an Amazon wishlist.\n\nAmazon automatically creates a wishlist URL, which will need to be imported into Purse.\n\nThe user will also have to transfer funds from their personal bitcoin wallet into their Purse-hosted wallet.\n\nPlacing an order\n\nPurse enables the user to choose the desired discount of up to 20% once the bitcoin funds have been transferred to its platform.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that first-time buyers are limited to a maximum discount of 8%.\n\nOnce the level of discount has been selected, the consumer receives a breakdown of the Amazon total, the fee charged by Purse and the total amount saved.\n\nThe user can then place the order.\n\nDelivery\n\nOnce the order has been placed and accepted by the bitcoin buyer, the user receives a notification at the email address provided during registration.\n\nThe bitcoin remains in escrow until the user notifies Purse that the order has been successfully delivered.\n\nReflecting on the process\n\nI encountered a series of issues with my order, which comprised of some sticky notes and a pack of ball pens.\n\nMy order was initially accepted by a buyer, who then rejected it. To try and understand why, I looked on the Purse marketplace page and realised that most smaller offers were still awaiting a buyer.\n\nTwo days later, I received a notification stating that another buyer had accepted the order.\n\nThe buyer contacted me to let me know that Amazon was only able to ship part of my order – the sticky notes. I was not entirely sure as to why this was the case, but Purse indicated that it had something to do with not selecting third party shipment on Amazon, which I had, as this is set to default.\n\nA 'dispute' was raised for the order, and a tedious exchange of messages between the Amazon buyer, Purse and me began.\n\nPurse confirmed that I would receive a partial delivery and that I would be refunded for the undelivered item.\n\nI received my order approximately a week after the order was placed and proceeded to confirm the shipment so that I could get my refund.\n\nPurse refunded me relatively quickly. However, I was charged a fee of 0.1% for withdrawing my bitcoin back into my Coinbase wallet.\n\nI struggled to understand why a service would charge you for withdrawing funds that have previously been refunded to you. However, a spokesperson from Purse said that this was merely the standard miners' fee – awarded for confirming transactions on the bitcoin network – and was not kept by the platform.\n\nOverall, despite my order arriving in good condition, I was left wondering if the hassle was really worth it for such a small discount.\n\nPros\n\nPurse offers relatively generous discounts to people wanting to buy Amazon items with bitcoin\n\nBeing able to modify the level of discount to attract buyers is a benefit\n\nThe service enables you to communicate with a Purse representative and the bitcoin buyer, keeping you updated throughout the process\n\nPurse respond to user requests relatively quickly and resolves issues in a timely manner\n\nBitcoin buyers and sellers are able to review each other and award points.\n\nCons\n\nIt can be difficult to find a buyer for a relatively small order\n\nAs a basic level user, you are initially limited to a 8% discount, although the front page of the site strongly promotes a figure of 20%\n\nThe buying process is somewhat convoluted and can be confusing at times\n\nNot being able to receive my full order – although this seems to be an issue with Amazon not shipping multiple orders, rather than a problem with Purse\n\nThe order arrived a full seven days after it was placed and I had to spend a considerable amount of time liaising with the buyer and Purse. I don't feel that the discount obtained justifies the time spent talking to both parties.\n\nCompetitors\n\nBrawker is very similar to the service offered by Purse, but allows shopping at any online retailer (see the CoinDesk review).\n\nUsers are also able to spend their bitcoin by purchasing gift cards for e-commerce sites. Companies such as eGifter, Gyft and Gift Off. enable customers purchase digital gift cards with bitcoin (and sometimes other cryptocurrencies) and then spend those cards at sites like Amazon, iTunes, Spotify and many others.\n\nHowever, unlike Brawker and Purse, these services do not currently offer any discounts.\n\nConclusion\n\nBeing able to spend bitcoin at Amazon is a huge step forward for general adoption, and the potential discounts offer an extra incentive to shop with the digital currency rather than credit/debit cards or PayPal.\n\nThe service is also useful for people who wish to purchase bitcoin with their credit or debit card – especially for those that do not want to register with ID and proof of address at an exchange.\n\nWhile I do not plan to use the service again for smaller orders (the incentive is just not big enough), I would consider doing so for more expensive items where the discount results in a more notable saving.\n\nDisclaimer: This article represents the experience of the reviewer. Please do your own extensive research before considering committing any funds to the service.""]"
03/14/2015,"['UPDATE (14th March 16:18 GMT): Additional comment added from Chainalysis CEO Michael Grønager.\n\nCompliance startup Chainalysis was forced to defend itself today after allegations its surveillance tactics had disrupted services and threatened the privacy of bitcoin users.\n\nThe Swiss company, headed by ex-Kraken COO Michael Grønager and former Mycelium engineer Jan Møller, created over 250 \'false\' bitcoin nodes to harvest information on the whereabouts of transactions. The firm claims these nodes have now been shut down.\n\nThree Bitcoin Core developers, Wladimir van der Laan, Peter Todd and Gregory Maxwell, say Chainalysis\' actions amount to a so-called Sybil attack on the bitcoin network, something CEO Grønager denies.\n\nThe attack, named after dissociative identity disorder sufferer Shirley Ardell Mason, occurs when an individual creates multiple fake identities to gain influence in a peer-to-peer network.\n\nAs van der Laan told CoinDesk:\n\n""Non-functional nodes are injected in the network, in this case to syphon off information. They claim to be full nodes, but do not store blocks nor provide them when requested. This leaves other nodes that connect to them waiting, and that can cause slowdowns.""\n\nGrønager, by contrast, described the incident as an ""unintended partial Sybil attack"" as it affected relatively few and was ""carefully tailored"" not to cause harm to the core bitcoin network.\n\nSPV clients affected\n\nGrønager says his company created the fake nodes, first flagged by Bitcoin Talk user \'Evil-Knievel\', to gather location data for a blog post about bitcoin transfers between countries.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, he maintained Chainalysis had no malicious intentions to disrupt the network\'s SPV (simplified payment verification) clients, the \'lightweight\' bitcoin nodes that don\'t carry a full copy of the blockchain but rather rely on other trusted nodes for accurate network data.\n\nHe added:\n\n""To collect that kind of information [country data] with reasonable accuracy you need to listen on more than a few nodes. Apparently there is a weakness in some SPV clients so they ended up connecting only to our IPs ... if this has caused problems for SPV clients we apologise and would seek to fix this as soon as possible.""\n\nOne SPV-based service that was affected by Chainalysis\' fake nodes was the decentralised bitcoin wallet Breadwallet.\n\nAs the app has no centralised server, each Breadwallet user connects to the blockchain directly. Hence, when a user\'s wallet came across one of Chainalysis\' ""misbehaving"" nodes, it was prevented from syncing with the rest of the network.\n\n""Since these nodes aggressively broadcast the other nodes behaving the same way, the user might get in a position where they would connect to a non-syncing node nearly every time,"" Breadwallet developer Aaron Voisine explained. Unlike full nodes, which use Bitcoin Core, SPV clients often lack protective measures in node selection, such as clustering by IP address range.\n\nHe added that while he doesn\'t believe the node behaviour was malicious, it was certainly ""rude"".\n\nOther wallets have been less forgiving. Mycelium – where Møller still works as a consultant – penned a lengthy Reddit post on the subject that distanced the pro-anonymity project from Møller\'s new business venture.\n\nThe company has joined other node operators to block nodes in Chainalysis\' IP range from connecting with its own. Meanwhile, Breadwallet has pushed an update to avoid all nodes that display nonstandard behaviour.\n\nLegality questioned\n\nAccording to data tool BitNodes at press time, there are currently 6,489 bitcoin nodes distributed across the planet.\n\nUnlike miners, which reward their owners with freshly-minted coins, bitcoin nodes are not financially incentivised, but are run for the health of the network itself.\n\nThe more \'full\' nodes there are to store and relay bitcoin transactions, the fewer points of failure there are, and the more stable the network becomes.\n\nCritics say the actions of Chainalysis threatened this stability, and could even amount to illegal activity – ""exceeding unauthorised access"" – under anti-hacking laws, including the US\' Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), though this hasn\'t been confirmed.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Core developer Peter Todd expressed his concerns about the legality of Sybil attacks, which he said have the potential to impact all of bitcoin\'s users.\n\nHe added:\n\n""It’d be ironic if a service ostensibly intending to help with regulatory compliance did so by violating laws against disrupting and hacking networks.""\n\nIndeed, besides SPV clients, false nodes can make it harder for bitcoin\'s approximately 6,500 publicly accessible full nodes to sync up, find blocks and transmit transaction data, though fellow developer van der Laan denied hearing any reports of this for the Chainalysis nodes.\n\nBesides blocking the offending nodes, users on Reddit are also encouraging others to voice concerns about Chainalysis\' ""malicious"" use of its IP subnet on its hosting provider\'s abuse page.\n\nChainalysis denies any malicious behaviour – ""the accusations got a little out of hand,"" Grønager said – and rather points to its technology being used to help law enforcement, for example in tracking and locating stolen funds.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Funnily, following the Reddit post we have received a ton of emails from people with stolen bitcoins and requests for finding them – so yes, there is indeed a need [for this kind of service] and yes, we have received a lot of positive feedback from potential customers.""\n\nAnonymity vs compliance\n\nThe crux of the debate between Chainalysis and its critics centres around bitcoin\'s use: should it seek to serve financial institutions operating in heavily regulated environments, or those wishing to transact in privacy?\n\nOnline critics side with the latter, terming Chainalysis\' service ""unbelievably shitty behaviour to attack the network and sell it as a service"" and ""akin to spying"".\n\nChainalysis sides with the regulators. In providing what it calls \'automated transaction reporting\', the company says it is helping bitcoin companies conform to existing money transfer regulations, including the travel rule.\n\nThis, Grønager said, will help bitcoin businesses get bank accounts and promote the currency\'s use among mainstream financial institutions.\n\nHe added:\n\n""If you as a MSB (money services business) are offering automated transactions you are obliged to have suitable automated transaction monitoring. That is not to be confused with monitoring the entire bitcoin network, but transfers between you and your client, may that be fiat or may that be bitcoin. We are providing tools for facilitating exactly that.""\n\nHowever, others are questioning the reliability of these tools and the IP data they collect.\n\nBy finding the IP address of the first node that introduces a new transaction in the network, it is possible to guess its country using GeoIP. However, although there can be a weak correlation, receiving a transaction from a particular node does not mean that the individual running it was its creator, generally speaking.\n\nFor example, it could come from Tor, an Electrum server or a service like Blockchain\'s pushtx.\n\n""Their service cannot provide any guarantees, and many services have tried this before. What is new is how rudely they disrupt the network,"" said Wladimir, who stressed that this kind of analysis is, at best, a very unexact science.\n\nAdditionally, Todd cited past unconfirmed reports of inaccurate data leading to a user being arrested by police in 2013 after his IP address was falsely linked to criminal activity via blockchain sleuthing.\n\nThe IP debate\n\nDue to this weak correlation, companies like Blockchain see no problem in sharing bitcoin\'s IP data, which is public in the sense that it can be accessed by anyone on the network.\n\nIn a prepared statement, a spokesperson from the company said:\n\n""Blockchain.info engages in this kind of passive behaviour and publishes the data on its block explorer website under the \'Relayed by IP\' field. Along with this field, Blockchain notes that the IP address indicated is not equivalent to the origin of a bitcoin transaction.""\n\nThey added: ""In short, Blockchain.info nodes are passive in nature, only record publicly available data, and confirm to the standard behaviour of nodes on the network.""\n\nGrønager is keen to differentiate between Chainalysis\' service, which allows API customers to determine if a transaction originates from a \'safe\' partner, from those who publicly share data about IPs that have run the bitcoin client.\n\n""Chainalysis does not and will never share IP addresses or enable customers to buy such information, and we consider it highly problematic and unethical to engage in or facilitate that,"" he said, adding:\n\n""[Deanonymizing all transactions] could be an interesting exercise for investigation purposes, but probably hard to monetise for compliance. Further, if you try to follow stolen funds by IP you find that the thieves are using Tor anyway, so the main value you gain is the country of origin – hence our coming blogpost.""\n\nAll IP data that passes into the bitcoin network can be masked by anonymising services such as Tor and CoinJoin, which advocates argue can help protect the identities of users, and may prevent future Sybil attacks.\n\n“This is also a reminder to always use tor with Bitcoin 100% of the time (and to use a full node if you can), as that reduces the incentives to pull this kind of stunt,” Maxwell said in the original Bitcoin Talk post.\n\nTodd agrees:\n\n""Tor definitely helps as it makes it clear that you can\'t determine where a transaction originally came from, removing some of the incentive to perform these attacks. We also need to implement better protections against nodes that aren\'t contributing back to the network – like Chainalysis\'s nodes – from using up network capacity like proof-of-storage.""\n\nAs long as Bitcoin continutes to provide relatively poor privacy, people will continue to try to create services that take advantage of this, he added.\n\nIf nothing else, the events of the past 24 hours hammer home that fact that bitcoin operates on \'user-selectable privacy\' – by default it is no more secret than a google search from a home internet connection.\n\nWhether this should be used to bring the protocol up to regulator\'s standards or be changed to protect user identities, is still up for debate.\n\nHand image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""IBMCoin"" would allow users to send money anywhere in the world without having to use a third party that charges service fees.\n\nThe unconfirmed rumor stems from an anonymous ""person familiar with the matter."" So far, official media representatives at IBM and the US Federal Reserve have declined to comment.\n\nThe blockchain is considered to be Bitcoin\'s main technological innovation. It\'s a public ledger that records digital transactions, allowing users to make anonymous payments without government regulation. But unlike Bitcoin, where the network is decentralized, IBMCoin would be controlled by central banks and linked to users\' bank accounts, according to the unnamed source.\n\n""It\'s sort of a bitcoin but without the bitcoin,"" the source said. ""These coins will be part of the money supply. It\'s the same money, just not a dollar bill with a serial number on it, but a token that sits on this blockchain.""\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it\'s worth emphasizing again that this is an unconfirmed rumor, IBM is not the only major company or government entity that\'s purported to be dipping its toes in the digital economy: Rumors of both a ""Fedcoin"" and ""Eurocoin"" have bubbled up recently. There\'s no doubt that if IBM were to become the preferred government partner for next-gen fintech, the payoffs could be enormous.\n\nHey, if you can\'t stamp out cryptocurrency, might as well build your own. [BitCoin Magazine via Reuters.]\n\nTop image: Fdecomite / Flickr', 'It has often been said that bitcoin is the ideal digital casino chip. But what does that really mean?\n\nFor starters, it means that online gaming, more than anything else, is all about the customer experience.\n\nWhether it\'s a land-based casino or an online casino, gamblers want a seamless experience with immediacy and privacy, and operators want an irreversible payment method. Bitcoin provides all three.\n\nI recently made the prediction that within five years, half of the top 10 iGaming operators will be bitcoin-only.\n\nOf course, the mainstream online casino operators don\'t see it that way and I wouldn\'t expect them to. They have a profitable and expanding business model with national fiat currencies. Why would they want to disrupt that revenue stream?\n\nFunny thing about disruption though is that it rarely comes from within. Disruption comes from your blind spot.\n\nWhile major iGaming and industry gambling conferences in the west have paid lip service to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as alternative payment methods, they have simultaneously relegated it to a niche solution where presentations are neatly tucked away in a side corner. Kodak did the same thing after surprisingly inventing the first digital camera in 1975.\n\nReshaping the iGaming market\n\nThe grand opportunity with bitcoin is not with the major operators, which is exactly why I predict that half of the top 10 iGaming operators will soon be bitcoin-only.\n\nNew bitcoin gambling operations will evolve in that way organically – they will not be the major operators of today shedding their national fiat currency businesses. It will occur more along the lines of how Sony and Canon exploited Kodak\'s weak spot.\n\nThe major differences between bitcoin-only operators and the majors are a stark reminder of how complacency for something unusual and new can threaten an entire business model. The differences are revolutionizing the playing field.\n\nFor instance, bitcoin operators do not need to maintain a bank account anywhere in the world. If structured carefully, operating expenses can be covered entirely in bitcoin, including salaries and even real-time payouts to the all-important affiliates.\n\nProvably fair cryptographic techniques for casinos, like those deployed at SatoshiDice, eliminate the need for eCOGRA-type bodies to provide legitimacy and credibility.\n\nAnd probably most important, solving the payment dilemma in parts of the world under-served by banks or restricted by traditional payment networks opens up the world\'s vast unregulated gambling markets.\n\nWhile some licensed and national currency gambling sites attempt to push funding compliance to bitcoin wallet providers, other gambling sites are moving forward now by accepting bitcoin directly from customers. Indeed, bitcoin\'s strengths and speed-to-market play very well in this fertile and untapped ground.\n\nThese startling innovations will likely reshape the market for iGaming around the world, creating a new set of skills required for the industry, but that is not yet realized by today\'s mainstream market leaders.\n\nThe management team decisions that bitcoin operators need to be focused on include:\n\nIn-house vs outsourced payment processing\n\nHot wallet/cold wallet ratios to balance customer service and ultimate security\n\nProviding direct or indirect methods for customers to acquire bitcoin\n\nThe percentage of operational assets held in bitcoin vs national currency\n\nHedging and float yield strategies for bitcoin company assets\n\nBlockchain tech is the cutting edge\n\nWith the bitcoin network just a little over six years old, the current statistics related specifically to bitcoin and gaming are impressive.\n\nOne hundred percent of the world\'s countries can be reached via the bitcoin payment option and no other payment method can make that claim. It has been estimated by Coinometrics and others that approximately 40% of bitcoin network transaction volume is related to payments for online gaming. Bitcoin-only casino operators lead the field for the bitcoin-related web advertising market. And, there are over 150 bitcoin-only casinos and gambling sites operating today.\n\nAnoniBet claims to be the ""first bitcoin sportsbook and casino"" operating since 2011 and the original SatoshiDice pioneered the field of blockchain betting.\n\nSince the field is moving so rapidly, bitcoin gambling directories and lists have sprung up, with sites like my favorite Bitcoin Gambling Sites and the more objective Bitcoin Gambling Wiki. Some bitcoin gambling sites are simply too new to be listed, such as BurnTurn poker and the promising Augur project for a decentralized prediction market.\n\nIf you want to see where the innovation in gaming occurs today, the bitcoin and blockchain sector is the place to look.\n\nTaking the lead\n\nMy advice to bitcoin gaming businesses? Ignore the regulators.\n\nBy that I mean the gaming commission regulators at least while the industry is in a grey area. They don\'t know what they are doing with respect to bitcoin and, out of apathy, they frequently push the opportunity to the financial regulators who end up delaying implementation.\n\nBitcoin suffers from an outright usage ban or threatened ban in only three countries: Bolivia, Ecuador and Russia, which is still considering the final ban legislation, but blocks access to bitcoin-related websites in the meantime.\n\nRegulators are not leaders, they are followers. Don\'t count on them to be insightful and innovative. Their primary job is to slow you down.\n\nDo what you do best and build lasting and profitable businesses. Maybe even launch a skunkworks business within your organization. Failing that, perhaps acquire one of many bitcoin-only gambling operators from the industry lists above. Ultimately, it may assist in the upcoming drive to remain relevant.\n\nJon Matonis recently presented at a bitcoin seminar and a cryptocurrency regulatory compliance panel both for ICE.

It has made a stunningly fast impact on China, at least as a commodity investment if not yet in the retail sector. Australia has also been eager to join the digital party. Africa is starting to dip their toes in the water of crypto-currency. Let’s get an update on another region that is just starting to become aware of the economic revolution that is Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin in the infancy stage in Middle East\n\nWhile the most developed industrial regions of the world see Bitcoin in a toddler stage, the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) has been mostly in the local meet-up discussion stage. These Bitcoin awareness meetings attract 60-80 people on a weekly basis. A few stores do accept Bitcoin directly but, over the past year, a growing number of Bitcoin exchange platforms, payment gateways, e-wallets are entering this market, making it easier to access. In other words, Bitcoin’s baby steps are getting bigger and more confident, especially with local entrepreneurs. Many local currency experts and Bitcoin businessmen have weighed in on it’s status when speaking to Wamda.com\n\n“We see some activity in Kuwait, but it’s still low. We’re also starting to see a growing interest in KSA, Tunisia, and Egypt, but the main markets in the region so far are still Jordan, Lebanon, and Dubai,” says David El Achkar, founder of payment gateway YellowPay in Lebanon. “Currently, if you have money and you want to send it or receive it, your options are limited, costly, ineffective, and might need several days. But as soon as you start using Bitcoin, you’ll realize that it’s powerful and very simple to use. With just an app on your mobile phone, you can send 1 cent or 10,000 USD in one single click to anywhere in the world free of charge.”\n\nAlso read: The Bitcoin Dream Is Happening In Africa\n\nAn often ignored benefit of Bitcoin is the ability to bring banking to the unbanked, and MENA region consumers easily fall into this majority of the global population. Combined with the fact that 9 out of 10 people do have a smartphone in this region makes Bitcoin a great long-term solution to future economic empowerment through this technology. Fast exchange of funds has many benefits.\n\n“85% of transactions opt for cash-on-delivery, which constitutes a big problem for merchants as well as consumers. Bitcoin can be a solution,” says Fouad Jeryes, co-founder of the Bitcoin payment service CashBasha.\n\nOne company does see the open MENA region market as a reason to invest. Australian Bitcoin exchange platform iGot is looking to expand here, after many new acquisitions in Europe.\n\n“The economy of the UAE is very active and the UAE is a gateway between emerging and developed markets. Moreover, the Emirati government has a clear vision, and we believe that the UAE will be a hub for innovation in the near future. That’s why we decided to expand in the region,”Vignesh Raja, head of strategy development as the Bitcoin exchange platform iGot in Dubai.\n\nLocal experts feel that Bitcoin is very new but can become a major player within the next couple of years, once it’s advantages are realized, and word spreads. Remittances are a big market in the region, and they feel that success stories like the M-Pesa prove that consumers will be very open to saving money over establishment players like Western Union.\n\nImages provided by Wimimedia Commons and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Keith Kaiser was new to Bitcoin. Though he had invested in gold and other precious metals previously, this new digital gold was something that wasn’t immediately easy to wrap his mind around. He didn’t know how mining worked and, like many of us, he had no great understanding of cryptography. What he did have, though, was liquid capital to invest. So when he had the opportunity, he bought bitcoins using Circle. At this time, the price hovered around $200.\n\nTo invest means to profit, and when he saw a firm advertising on the popular precious metals price site, Kitco.com, that they were paying 10% over the market price per bitcoin, he was intrigued. Keith is exactly the kind of customer BTCLowen is looking for – mildly skeptical, new to the industry, and not expecting to get ripped off. Over the course of a few transactions, BTCLowen would bilk Keith out of 15 bitcoins.\n\n“Kitco, you know, it’s a highly reputable financial site. It’s been around forever – everybody uses it, when you’re dealing in gold and silver, really, and bullion, people who sell the bullion to you, that’s what they use to get the spot price from and everything else,” Keith explained to CCN.\n\nBTCLowen\n\nBTCLowen claims to be long on bitcoin, and this is the reason they are willing to pay 10% above the market rate. In a down market, which is what we’ve been in since the end of December, investors will not exactly look a gift horse in the mouth right away. But a bit of thinking on the matter would lead one to realize that someone could simply buy the BTC at market rate and make a 10% profit right away, flipping them over to BTCLowen. Furthermore, why wouldn’t BTCLowen just buy them at market rate, using an established service like LocalBitcoins?\n\nThe first thing I did when assigned this story was contact the site, asking what was the deal with PayPal accusing them of using stolen PayPal accounts? As you can see below, they were extremely defensive.\n\nKeith Kaiser\n\nI called Keith Kaiser on the phone and recorded the call, so I could pull details from it later. What emerges is a very sad story of someone who just honestly wanted a piece of a new phenomenon. Keith, in regards to Bitcoin, is exactly what you think of when you think of a “Bitcoin civilian.” He has no ties to any particular outfit; he’s only looking to not miss the boat. He’s not a computer expert, just an everyday nine-to-fiver who manages his money in such a way that he can invest and maybe retire early.\n\n“The first transaction I did was one bitcoin because even though I found them on all these reputable sites and everything else, you know, it’s still speculation. So I said, let’s do one and see how it goes and make sure it’s not something crazy – I mean, they may be unprofessional to talk to, but they’re professional scam artists, I promise you that. So I sold them the one, and they tell you, later on if you’re a repeat customer, if you sell them up to four, they’ll give you 12%. If you sell them up to 10, they’ll give you up to 14%. So the PayPal stuff came in instantly. So I checked it. It was in my account. So I’m like, alright, well; then I’ll do four more. Same thing. Went through instantly. The money’s in there. It’s a plus, no minuses, it’s good to go. […] I set it up to transfer to my bank accounts. Nothing went on. Then, like, a day or two later, bitcoin started going up, so I figured – this is a legitimate thing – I went and when the bitcoin went up […] I sold ten of them to them. Then I went and checked my PayPal account, and now I see all my positive balances were back to the negative, and I called PayPal instantly, and they said they were putting stops on money, and they were saying it’s not theirs. I get on BTCLowen’s live chat, and they say, we’re sorry, sometimes PayPal does that. We’ll repay your money. So it still sounds like it’s a legitimate thing. They redid the money. One of the amounts went to me, actually, it clear. Then the large amount and the small amount got rejected again, so I called PayPal and said, What’s going on? They never got me to the fraud department […] until it was too late, the third guy I talked to, he e-mailed me back, and said they’re using other people’s accounts.”\n\nAfter Keith got wise to their game, he started inquiring of them exactly what the hell was going on. In response, BTCLowen banned one of his IP addresses. He says he’s sure this is what happened because he was still able to access the site from his mobile device.\n\nPayPal\n\nI asked Keith to provide details of his encounter with PayPal as well as the transaction record, for clarity. Before we get to that, let’s have a look at the Blockchain records of the bitcoins Keith sent them. They are here, here, and here. The common denominator is the address 13M5fwkMuFT7t3VY6Rm5tmZwm3kATUDmJo.\n\nHere is what the PayPal fraud department representative had to say:\n\nDear Keith Kaiser, Thank you for contacting PayPal Customer Support. My name is Adrian and we spoke earlier on the phone. I’ve done some investigating on my end and the conclusion to that is the accounts that the funds were given the money back to were in fact compromised and used without the real account holders authorization. The actual account holders called in to open up those cases. So the “company” you are doing business with is someone that has taken over certain PayPal accounts and are sending you payments without the account holders authorization. As far as the other account where the funds were not placed on hold; if that is not from the same company you have been dealing with then there might not be a chance of it being investigated. If it is from the same company then it’s only a matter of time until the actual account holder will start an investigation. Please if you have any more question then feel free to give us a call at 1-888-221-1161. It is my pleasure to assist you. Thank you for choosing PayPal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAdrian\n\nPayPal Customer Solutions\n\nPayPal, an eBay Company\n\nHere is Keith’s transaction log from PayPal:\n\nBTCLowen.com Is A Scam\n\nAs it turns out, the operators behind BTCLowen.com were exposed by CoinTelegraph a few weeks back, and CCN ourselves were the victim of the stolen PayPal account game. They were purchasing advertising, of course, something that Keith says they’re very good at it. He provided a long list of places he had seen their advertisements in, besides the reputable metals dealer previously mentioned. Places such as local, mainstream news outlets.\n\nThe biggest red flag with them was that they did not pay from a business PayPal account and paid from multiple PayPal accounts as well. So I must give the following warning in clear terms, so nobody’s left wondering.\n\nThe following sites should be avoided at all costs. Selling any amount of Bitcoin to them is known to be a costly endeavor, as the funds will be reversed, and you will be without your Bitcoin afterward.\n\nbtclowen.com\n\nmywalletbtc.com\n\nsellbtcinstant.com\n\nFor all we know, the same people have opened up new sites in the meantime. BTCLowen itself appears to have been registered using a privacy service, and may or may not be hosted in Virginia. The address they were currently accepting with at the time of writing had received 86 BTC – about $23,000.\n\nAs for Keith, he hasn’t fully given up on Bitcoin, even after all this. He reached out to us because he doesn’t want anyone else to go through what he’s gone through. He still holds more Bitcoin than your average internet troll, and says he plans to acquire more when the time is right. It says a lot about our favorite digital currency that even after getting scammed in such a heinous manner, people still trust it more than they trust the debt-based currency of our government.\n\nCCN will keep you posted if any future developments arise.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The idea of fusing cryptocurrency into video game economies is an idea that has been tossed around very frequently in the online gaming and cryptocurrency communities. Many players dream of their hours spent in game translating to a healthy profit once they are ready to withdraw, but this idea hasn’t reached many games.\n\nBitquest, however, does just that. Launched in December of 2014, Bitquest boasts the only public Minecraft experience out there that is directed by bitcoin. The in game economy on the server is emeralds. Players can obtain emeralds through a variety of tasks, primarily by killing mobs, looting dungeon chests, and trading with other players. Every emerald is worth one bit, or one millionth of a bitcoin. Each player has a custom deposit address that they can be use to send in bitcoin and receive emeralds in game. When ready to turn their emeralds back to bitcoin, players can simply put emeralds into an enderchest, which functions as a bank on the server. The bank destroys the emeralds, and convert their value into bitcoin, which then get sent out to the address of the player.\n\nRight now, the server has three ways of generating bitcoin to distribute to the player: mining, sponsorship, and donation. A majority of the emeralds come from the hardware of the server itself, which doubles as a miner to create a steady flow of BTC that is converted into emeralds. Emeralds get distributed through mobs, who occasionally drop emeralds on death. The server is also sponsored by Xapo. Xapo is an online wallet that specializes in fast and easy microtransactions. Xapo is the service the server uses for all transactions, both withdrawals and deposits. In exchange, Xapo helps pay for the hardware and putting emeralds into circulation. They also hold serverwide contests, their last being a building contest with a 1 BTC grand prize.\n\nBitcoin definitely makes Bitquest unique, but the gameplay is also one you won’t find anywhere else. Bitquest is an RPG server, players can level up by killing mobs. Leveling up gives players more health and strength, which allow them to fight higher level monsters, who also drop more emeralds. Everything on the server is custom coded, and there are many other unique features. Dungeons with custom loot chests, private player plots, and other features enrich the gameplay without taking away from the authentic feel of vanilla Minecraft.\n\nMany players, however, play for a different reason. Bitquest hosts a very friendly and helpful community that can’t be found on other Minecraft servers. A lot of players come on to the server with the desire to have success and acquire bitcoin. However, many stay because of the welcoming playerbase. The server is driven by community projects, contests, and adventures.\n\nBitquest is constantly growing, and they desire to one day become the major choice for all bitcoin gamers. Bitcoiners and Minecrafters alike come together to live in perfect harmony on this server driven by the popular cryptocurrency. This server is a great home to anyone interested in earning bitcoin or simply looking for a server to call home.', 'IBM soll einem Medienbericht zufolge eine eigene Kryptowährung mit der auch bei Bitcoin verwendeten Blockchain-Technik samt eigenem Zahlungssystem planen. IBMCoin soll es dem Anwender ermöglichen, Geld weltweit fast ohne Gebühren zu überweisen.\n\nIBMCoin soll das neue Zahlungssystem heißen, das IBM angeblich entwickelt. Nach einem Bericht der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters soll die Kryptowährung Geldtransaktionen weltweit mit niedrigen Überweisungsgebühren ermöglichen. Offiziell angekündigt hat IBM das System bisher nicht - der Reuters-Bericht stützt sich auf einen Informanten.\n\nAnders als Bitcoin soll IBMCoin nicht auf einer dezentralen Verwaltung aufbauen, sondern von zentralen Stellen aus verwaltet werden und mit dem Bankkonto der Nutzer verbunden sein. Wie anonym ein solches System ist, geht aus dem Bericht nicht hervor.\n\nGünstige und schnelle Überweisungen weltweit möglich\n\nDer Quelle nach soll IBM mit Zentralbanken inklusive der Federal Reserve in den USA gesprochen haben, die sich gegenüber Reuters jedoch nicht dazu äußern wollte. IBM beschäftigt sich schon eine Weile mit der Blockchain-Technik, auf der auch Bitcoin basiert. Mit der Blockchain werden vereinfacht ausgedrückt Transaktionen zwischen Computern verwaltet, wobei jede Veränderung dezentral gespeichert und damit nur sehr schwer manipulierbar ist, aber sehr einfach zu verifizieren. Eigentlich benötigt man deshalb gar keine zentrale Instanz zur Verwaltung mehr - zumindest aber nicht mehr viele dazwischenliegende Banken, die als Mittelsmänner agieren, wenn es um internationale Überweisungen. Das könnte der Ansatz sein, den IBM verfolgt. Letztlich könnte das nicht nur die Transaktionen verbilligen, sondern auch erheblich beschleunigen.\n\nDie IBM-Währung dürfte allerdings kein Geld-Mining beinhalten. Das ist auch beim Startup Ripple so, das mit der Kryptowährung XRP ebenfalls so etwas wie die IBMCoins entwickelt hat. Auch hier können über Gateways verschiedene Währungen über das Internet zu geringen Kosten weltweit transferiert werden.', 'Josh Noble in Hong Kong MARCH 15, 2015 1 The Hong Kong stock exchange will roll out an upgrade to its equity trading link into China in the next few weeks, something analysts hope will encourage global asset managers to start using the facility. The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which launched in November, has been hailed as a landmark opening of domestic Chinese markets, enabling international investors to trade onshore equities without a special licence for the first time. However, because of operational problems with the scheme, many large fund managers have stayed on the sidelines, relying instead on the long-established quota system for accessing the Chinese market. Activity through the Stock Connect has been lacklustre, with only banks and hedge funds taking part. The main problems centre on the ownership of securities and the settlement of trades. Investors must transfer shares they wish to sell to their custodian bank or broker before the start of the trading day so that the stock exchange can verify that the seller owns the asset. This gives the custodian temporary legal ownership of the security, increasing counterparty risk for the seller should a custodian unexpectedly run into trouble. Since the financial crisis, investors have become more cautious about counterparty risk, even if just for a few hours during the execution of a trade. Trade settlement is also an issue. Currently, buyers take hold of securities on the day of a trade but sellers must wait another day to receive the cash. Once again investors, when selling shares, are left exposed to the possibility of counterparty failure. Market participants hope that a forthcoming operational change — announced in January and now being tested — will help fix both issues, paving the way for the world’s largest fund managers to embrace the scheme. The main change will allow investors to keep their shares but will enable the stock exchange to peer into their accounts to confirm their holdings. That, in turn, will make it possible for most brokers to offer a synthetic early settlement of trades, in effect fronting the cash to sellers a day before receiving it from the buyer. For now, this synthetic settlement is available only through the handful of investment banks that have both custodian and equity-trading businesses. “It doesn’t solve all the issues,” said Stephane Loiseau, head of Asian cash equities at Société Générale. “But everyone is quite bullish that this second version will help, especially for those [institutional] funds who’ve been effectively barred up to now.” Challenges for asset managers are likely to remain. Many have mandates that prevent them from investing in the Chinese mainland, so they must redraft these rules before they can start buying through Stock Connect. A shortage of English-language research on Shanghai-listed stocks is another problem, while legal questions remain over certain shareholder rights such as being able to sue a mainland Chinese company. The Hong Kong exchange plans to open a second link with the Shenzhen stock exchange this year, and hopes to add other asset classes — such as equity derivatives and fixed income — later on.', '', 'Natural Gas Price Forecast\n\nNatural gas has been absolutely pummelled for the last decade after making an all time high in 2005 at US$15.78. Price now sits around US$2.75. What a spanking!\n\nSo, does there look to be an end in sight to this devastating downtrend? Yes and no. Let\'s begin with the ""no"" which involves the big picture yearly chart.\n\nNatural Gas Yearly Chart\n\nWe can see price has been smashed from that 2005 high which has caused immense misery for the bulls. The picture that flashes before me is the scene from Frank Herbert\'s 1984 movie Dune whereby Paul Atreides puts his hand in the pain box and exclaims, ""The pain!"" Well, the natural gas bulls are currently ensconced in their own pain box.\n\nThere looks to be a ""three strikes and you\'re out"" low setting up which consists of three consecutive lower lows. This is denoted by the numbers 1, 2 and 3. Now, due to the massive bear trend in play, consideration also needs to be given to a fourth strike which would really nail down the low if that were to occur. And this is the yearly chart, no less, so there still appears to be plenty of time left in this bear market.\n\nThe Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) is looking weak but the next low looks like it might set up a bearish divergence.\n\nThe Stochastic indicator is still trending down with a bearish bias so no joy there either for the bulls.\n\nSo where is the final low likely to be? Good question and I must admit to be quite unsure about that.\n\nI have drawn a horizontal line denoting the 1992 low which stands at US$1.02. For now I favour the final low to be just above that level but it really would not surprise me to see price nudge a bit below.\n\nI have added Bollinger Bands and price now looks headed for the lower band which is currently at 76c and rising slowly.\n\nThere still looks to be at least 3 years before we might start contemplating a low and that is probably underestimating how much longer this bear trend has left in it.\n\nLet\'s now go to the ""yes"" which involves the weekly chart.\n\nNatural Gas Weekly Chart\n\nI have added a Fibonacci Fan and price looks to be finding support at the 88.6% angle. I often see price stage significant rallies off this fan angle and I think we are about to see that here.\n\nThe Parabolic Stop and Reverse (PSAR) indicator now has a bullish bias after price busted the dots on the upside a few weeks ago.\n\nThe RSI and Stochastic indicator are both showing a bullish divergence on the recent low while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is showing a recent bullish crossover.\n\nThe Bollinger Bands show price has moved away from the lower band and is now just under the middle band. Sure, it is possible for price to break lower but that would likely see price bounce back up off the lower band.\n\nSo, the evidence is mounting that a decent rally is set to commence if it hasn\'t already.\n\nThe 100 period moving average (red) has just made a bearish crossover of the 50 period moving average (blue) however I often find price rallies after this event.\n\nAssuming we have a low in place, I have added Fibonacci retracement levels of the move down from February 2014 high to February 2015 low. I favour price rallying up to around the 61.8% level at US$4.99 and perhaps a touch above which might also be around resistance from the 61.8% fan angle if the timing is right for a high around September this year. Let\'s see.\n\nAfter the expected rally high, price should head back down as the overall downtrend once again asserts its authority.\n\nLet\'s wrap it up with the monthly chart.\n\nNatural Gas Monthly Chart\n\nThere looks to be a 5 point broadening low in play denoted by the numbers 1 to 5. Price looks to be tracing its way to the point 5 low but that may still be quite a way off.\n\nI have drawn a trend line connecting the 2001 low with the point 1 low. I like trend lines like these that aren\'t obvious. Price is now down around this support line and I expect a bounce from here.\n\nI have added moving averages with time periods of 100 (red) and 200 (black) and they have just made a bearish crossover with the red line crossing below the black line. As often happens after these bearish events, price then rallies back up to test the averages.\n\nI have also added Bollinger Bands and I\'d like to see the rally high be rejected around the upper band.\n\nI expect any rally to be a bear rally with price the coming back down to eventually put in the point 5 low.\n\nAnd there looks to be a good chance that the point 5 low will set up triple bullish divergences on the RSI and MACD indicator. That would be a promising sign for the bulls. But alas, that may still be several years away.\n\nAnd once the final bear market low is in place, price will need to go up and bust the downtrend line connecting the 2005 and 2008 highs. That would indeed be thrilling for the bulls but once again I don\'t see that happening anytime soon.\n\nSumming up, this bear market still has a lot of time to play out and quite frankly it just isn\'t a market I have any interest being involved in. Not yet anyway.\n\nBy Austin Galt\n\nwww.thevoodooanalyst.com\n\nAustin Galt is The Voodoo Analyst. I have studied charts for over 20 years and am currently a private trader.

03/15/2015,"[""The app, with its stark white and black animations is pretty aggressive. And so is the promo video above. But underneath all that raging testosterone is a sophisticated piece of software that uses an algorithm that mines slivers of bitcoin based on the intensity and duration of your activity. So, even if you don't have time to run a marathon, you can bump up your earning power by plowing through some high-intensity interval runs.\n\nThe idea of earning money or even bitcoin for working out isn't exactly new. But even for a proof of concept the Chaotic Moon take on it seems pretty polished. Of course, chances that this is going to become a shipping product are pretty slim. That's not really the business this company is in. They just like to make cool shit."", 'The activities of one startup company came under heavy scrutiny after community members, including Bitcoin core developers, accused it of surveilling the activities of “large parts” of the bitcoin network.\n\nUncovered\n\nThe startup’s activities were first brought to light by Bitcoin Forum user “Evil-Knievel”, who started a forum thread titled “Is someone monitoring large parts of the network?” on March 6.\n\nHe wrote, “What I noticed is, that the seed nodes (from time to time) return dozens of bitcoin addresses from the same subnet (from France). This, on the first sight, looks to me as a large scale monitoring of the bitcoin network.”\n\nEvil-Knievel also raised the question of what the purpose of the mysterious nodes was. He asked, “What is going on there? And who is owning the huge amount of bitcoin nodes? And what is the intention? Monitoring? Netsplits?”\n\nA week later, forum user “Cryptowatch.com” stated that he had performed an analysis of one of the nodes, and found evidence linking it to Chainalysis, a startup company purporting to provide “financial institutions with the means to obtain regulatory compliance through real-time analysis of the blockchain”.\n\nChainalyis – which is led by Kraken exchange advisor Michael Gronager, and former VMware and Mycelium engineer Jan Møller – states that it does so by performing “sophisticated in-depth real-time transaction analysis to determine unique entities within the blockchain”.\n\nLegality questioned\n\nBitcoin forum user “RealMalatesta” shared his belief that Chainalysis is violating the laws of the country it is based in, Switzerland.\n\nHe posted, “First of all, I am pretty sure that Chainalysis is violating Swiss laws by collecting this data and giving this data to their clients. But this is an issue for lawyers in Switzerland. Me, for my part, have sent a request to the Swiss data protection agency. I want to know WHAT they collect and see it.”\n\nRealMalatesta found that the company, which was established on December 24, 2014, is owned by Trifork Holding AG, and Danish companies Swift Bit Holding ApS and Ceptacle Holding ApS.\n\nHe concluded his findings:\n\nSo basically, Chainanalysis is controlled by foreign corporations. And I want to know how Chainalaysis is complying with the Swiss Data Protection laws. An IP address is, according to Swiss law, “personal data”. According to this law, Chainanalysis has to give access to all the data they have regarding a specific IP to the person who was using this IP at the time the data was collected. Such a request can be sent to Chainanalysis by e-mail and they have to respond without the right to charge anything for this. They have to tell them how they obtained this data and what they intend to do with it. Furthermore, they have to make sure and public how the personal data of users of the Bitcoin network is protected. If they don’t, everybody can write a complaint to the Swiss data protection agency.\n\nCommunity members pitch in\n\nMycelium community manager Dmitry Murashchik spoke out regarding former employee Jan Møller’s actions, saying, “We at Mycelium are not fans of what Chainalysis does, but we can’t really object too much, because if something like this is even possible to do, then someone will do it, whether it’s Jan’s company or someone else.”\n\nBitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell stated that Chainalysis’ actions was performing an “attack trying to trick nodes into leaking private data”.\n\nPeter Todd, who is also a core developer of the cryptocurrency, told CoinDesk:\n\nIt’d be ironic if a service ostensibly intending to help with regulatory compliance did so by violating laws against disrupting and hacking networks.\n\nChainalysis responds\n\nMichael Grønager, CEO of Chainalysis, said, “Claiming that Chainalysis should do anything illegal based on other nodes connecting to our nodes relaying INVs is highly speculative. I cannot see any difference between that and connecting to any other service (HTTP/DNS etc) and recording that info for statistical purposes.”\n\nStating that he is “by no means an expert”, Grønager also posed a number of questions: “When are you (illegally) eavesdropping by participating in a p2p network? What are you allowed to do with the data/metadata (e.g. INVs and TXs) you receive? What can you as a p2p user (legally) expect them to be used for? Do we actually expect any regulation to cover here at all?”\n\nYou decide\n\nAfter speaking about Chainalysis’ actions, core developer Gregory Maxwell said, “In general, I’ve been disappointed by how few people realize how important privacy and fungibility is for Bitcoin’s viability as a currency.”\n\nDo you believe that Chainalysis’ monitoring of the bitcoin network is justified? Should bitcoin users be the only people responsible for ensuring that their activities stay private?\n\nLet us know what you think in the comments below, and follow us on Twitter for updates to this developing story.', 'Selachii LLP became the first law firm in the UK to accept payment in Bitcoin for its services in 2013. According to information contained on its website, Selachii LLP chose to get in “at the start” and has used Bitcoin to grow what it describes as an impressive business.\n\nHigh Profile Bitcoin Cases\n\nSelachii LLP has handled several major cases involving Bitcoin. One of the most well-known ones involve the Japanese Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, where the firm is acting on behalf of the claimants. In addition to the Mt. Gox case, the firm also has some other high profile cases including the Moolah and Mintpal cases, both crypto exchanges based in the UK.\n\nIn an interview with CryptoCoinsNews, Richard Howlett, a solicitor and a leading partner at Selachii LLP, predicts that the overall impact of the Mt. Gox case on UK jurisprudence would be minimal. According to Mr Howlett, the approach of the authorities in Japan to handle the Mt. Gox case has been “low key”, something that he attributes to Japanese culture. He was, however, optimistic on ongoing Bitcoin litigation in the UK. He said,\n\n“I feel that the litigation we are handling in the UK will have a greater impact worldwide and also concerning the trust issues BTC has suffered from. Once there is accountability for exchanges by way of prosecution or Court Order; this will build trust for consumers.”\n\nThe firm has also scored successes in the Moolah case mentioned earlier. A client involved in the case stated,\n\n“’Our ( Selachii) solicitors were at the Royal Courts of Justice today to deal with the matter of the emergency injunction we had filed over the weekend in regards to the missing 750BTC that Moolah LTD/Ryan Kennedy (aka: Alex Green) were responsible for managing. We are very pleased with the ruling the court made this morning.”\n\nBitcoin and Regulation\n\nMr Howlett believes Bitcoin exchanges need regulation. He told CCN:\n\n“exchanges need to be regulated in order for BTC to enjoy widespread adoption. For example, with regulation, the issues at Mt Gox, Moolah and Mintpal may not have occurred. The Mt Gox case led to a massive crash for BTC. When the exchanges can be trusted via regulation, adoption will pick up.”\n\nAs a result of handling several Bitcoin cases both in the UK and overseas, Selachii LLP has established itself as a law firm that is at the vanguard in the use of technology. It won an award for the Best Use of Technology in 2014 for becoming the first law firm in the UK to accept bitcoins as a valid means of payment by its clients, a method of payment that now forms a large part of the firm’s business. Mr Howlett says that as a result of this decision, the firm’s client base has grown “exponentially” since 2014.\n\nImage source: Selachii LLP’s website.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Today’s article features a Bitcoin trading advisory published at xbt.social.

Furthermore, it is not known how the data presented in the chart is compiled. Does Bitcoincharts.com take the exchanges’ word for their figures, or do they correlate it with transactions in the blockchain? Just like their counterparts in the West, the Asian exchanges are in the business of making market. All the exchanges are, in the final analysis, opaque and not trustworthy.\n\nRegardless of the lack of credibility and issues of trust with the exchanges, BTC/CNY and BTC/USD are the dominant trading pairs. The sheer bulk of traders who opt to trade these instruments bears testament to the popularity of the USD and CNY as everyday currencies. Most banks and merchants accept either and there is liquidity in these currency markets, meaning you can get in and out of BTC/CNY and BTC/USD with relative ease.\n\nPracticality\n\nThe trader’s choice of currency may also be based on practical considerations: it simply depends on what is more convenient for you. For example, if you have a GBP-based bank account then it’s rational to trade BTC/GBP and withdraw the fiat without having to pay fees on exchanging, say, USD to GBP.\n\nGlobal Economic Outlook\n\nThere are some longer-term implications as to which fiat currency you want to hold. Traders should further research the points discussed below and consider positioning themselves accordingly.\n\nThe Euro is a currency in distress and it is being actively devalued by the European Central Bank. Unless you’re a citizen of the European Union where you need to use Euros on a day-to-day basis, it is probably not a currency you want to be holding in the coming years.\n\nThe British Pound is strong but during a global economic slump (such as we’re in) one would expect the British service and financial industry to weaken and the GBP along with it.\n\nThe US Dollar – irrespective of one’s view of US foreign policy – is the international currency of choice and after the end of a massive Quantitative Easing program by the Federal Reserve, the US Dollar can be expected to reflate – in other words become stronger and it’s chart shows this.\n\nWhat about the Chinese Yuan? Does China becoming the new superpower guarantee strengthening of its national currency, and make the Yuan a safe bet?\n\nPossibly, but there is a currency war being instigated in Asia by Japan. The Bank of Japan launched, in 2013, the largest Quantitative Easing program in history. ‘Abenomics’ is a drastic set of economic policies being implemented as a means of escaping 25 years of crippling deflation in Japan. One of the “three arrows” of ‘Abenomics’ is currency devaluation. By devaluing the Yen, Japan is boosting it’s export market (cheaper products from Japan), but in the process is muscling in on the export markets of its Asian neighbors – notably that of China.\n\nTo protect its market share, China may be forced into devaluing the Yuan as a means of remaining competitive and meeting long-term economic goals. So, just because China is the world’s biggest economy and growing, does not mean its currency is simultaneously strengthening.\n\nRead more:\n\nRegional Currency War in Asia\n\nAbenomics and Japan\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a preferred store of value, the currency of choice is the US Dollar for at least the next 3 years. Bitcoin is an excellent store of value when it is rising in price, so the sensible investment strategy is to hold bitcoin during a Bitcoin price rally and to convert to dollar at the top – ready to buy bitcoin at the next BTC/USD market bottom.\n\nxbt.social issues general Trade Recommendations advising members whenever it is an opportune moment to convert between US Dollar and bitcoin holdings.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price is starting the next phase of advance to a tough chart area in the $300-$400 and 1900-2400 CNY range.

Wiper has integrated the ability to send bitcoin via their messaging system in a recent update. The app also features the ability to manage messages that have already been sent or received, as well as the ability to voice chat through the app through an encrypted call system.\n\nThe addition of bitcoin transactions was met with overwhelming support by both users of the application as well as bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide. Both communities share the common belief of personal privacy and anonymity, and this feature helped connect large communities of both entities.\n\nChina, however, was not as fond of the feature as many of the users were. According to Manlio Carrelli, the company’s CEO, Wiper was promptly removed from Appe’s iOS App Store in China, shortly following the release of the new cryptocurrency feature. In regards to the removal, Carrelli stated that Wiper was “removed from the iOS App Store in China due to violating that app store’s policies,” The CEO also mentioned, “Apple [had] explained to [the company] by phone that this violation was related to Wiper enabling bitcoin payments.”\n\nWiper received significant support immediately following its launch in the summer of 2014. The popularity of the app has grown exponentially since then, achieving 8 million downloads in the last three months. Wiper was able to initially launch thanks to the $2.5 million in funding the company received for their concept that has since become this controversial app.\n\nThe messenger application field is one saturated with a variety of apps, who all offer essentially the same service. What sets Wiper apart is the power it gives to its users. Unlike any other messaging system, Wiper allows users to delete single messages or entire conversations from both parties involved. Unread messages can be removed before their contents revealed, and messages that have been shared can also be removed from both the sender and receiver. The company only holds temporary records of conversations and messages, which are also deleted during the process.\n\nBitcoin was an obvious choice for the app, as both excel in security and anonymity, but the company stated they had other reasons for choosing the popular cryptocurrency. Wiper feels that bitcoin is a solution to help people worldwide who do not have sufficient access to adequate banking. According to the company, 2.5 billion people worldwide fit this description.\n\nWiper also offers several other services alongside the secure chatting feature. Users can privately browse, stream, and share music and videos with their contacts. Wiper also features an app-to-app calling feature. These calls are encrypted to prevent unwanted ears. Afterwards, all contents of the call are deleted, as Wiper holds no log of any calls. Lastly, Wiper notifies its users when messages are read, deleted, or screenshotted. This helps make it easy for users to maintain tabs on their messages. Lastly, Wiper also notifies whenever a music or video is forwarded to another person.\n\nChina has had an interesting relationship with bitcoin, to say the least, and the removal of this app does not come as a surprise. Among other issues, China has had a habit of banning large exchanges running in its country in the past. Despite the regulations China sometimes imposes on bitcoin, it is believed that 80% of all bitcoin transactions take place within the country. It will be interesting to see how China reacts to similar innovations in the future, as they have not maintained a clear policy against the cryptocurrency as of yet. If any thing can be deduced from this ban, it is that China will most likely continue this behavior in the future.', 'Block Verify announced on March 6th that they have a partnership with a UK pharmaceutical company to begin ensure the validity of pharmaceuticals using the Blockchain.\n\nBlock Verify, a blockchain-based anti-counterfeit solution, wants to have a global, positive social impact by using blockchain technology to ""make the world more honest.""\n\nPavlo Tanasyuk, founder of Block Verify (and co-founder of SpaceBit), told CoinTelegraph:\n\n""We decided to start with [the pharmaceutical industry] as it is one of the sectors where people are directly affected by using counterfeit products.

It has the unique distinction of being the only homeless outreach in the world primarily funded by cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to Jason King, founder of Sean\'s Outpost:\n\n""Bitcoin is significantly cheaper than credit card processing. If you think of 1.7% to 3.4% fee to process those transactions and for the right to get that money. Sean’s Outpost has raised approximately $240,000 in 20 months, we have saved $8400 just for using bitcoin instead of credit cards. $8400 is a good amount of money but to a non-profit that it is a huge amount of money. Which means that at Sean’s Outpost, we were able to feed an additional 6720 meals to the homeless, simply because we took Bitcoin rather than credit cards.""\n\nThe Wall Street Bitcoin Alliance (WSBA), a trade advocacy group composed of financial market professionals, was formed last week and plans to educate the financical movers and shakers on Wall Street.\n\nThe WSBA is looking to ""guide and promote comprehensive adoption of digital currency and blockchain technology across financial markets.""\n\nAccording to founder and executive director, Ron Quaranta:\n\n""Bitcoin and blockchain technology and protocols represent a seismic shift in how financial markets, and all aspects of the global economy, will operate in the future.

But Brazilians don’t seem to be interested in jumping on to the bitcoin bandwagon.\n\nSurprisingly for a country which is the 5th largest when it comes to number of internet users, the adoption of bitcoins is very low, with less than 0.1% bitcoin wallet downloads. A number of reasons ranging from lack of knowledge to regulatory issues can be listed for slow adoption of bitcoin in Brazil.\n\nLanguage\n\nWith Portuguese being their native tongue, most Brazilians are not proficient in English. Whereas most of the literature available on the internet concerning bitcoins is in English, making it inaccessible to the general public.\n\nRegulations on Bitcoin in Brazil\n\nThe Brazilian Central Bank is not friendly towards bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. The Central Bank of Brazil issued a warning last year stating all the potential risks associated with virtual instruments. It explicitly states the possibility of being subjected to investigations and financial losses, discouraging people from using bitcoins. Not to mention the taxes on assets (Brazil, like US, categorizes digital currency as assets) and strict foreign exchange regulations associated with cryptocurrencies. Any foreign exchange transaction that doesn’t adhere to the regulations is a crime, the very thought of committing a crime, unwittingly has got many Brazilians afraid of using bitcoins.\n\nEconomy\n\nA lot of bitcoin users in unstable economies use bitcoin as a hedging tool against inflation. Brazilian Real (BRL), unlike other Latin American currencies has proven to be a stable and reliable currency. So, Brazilians don’t find the necessity to hedge bitcoins. Those who use it as an investment tool stick to trading and arbitrage to make gains.\n\nDue to the higher forex costs in the country, Bitcoins in Brazilian exchanges cost more than other international exchanges, which is again a drawback for people who want to buy bitcoins in Brazil.\n\nInvestments and Market Opportunities\n\nBoth Argentina and Brazil have been the hosts of Latin American Bitcoin Expo in 2013 and 2014 respectively. But in stark contrast, the Argentinian market has attracted a lot of bitcoin based startups and investments.\n\nBitcoin in Brazil still has a long way to go in terms with the rest of the world.', 'Before discussing anything further about Bitcoin China or the future, let’s ask — what does it take to make Bitcoins? The answer is either mining or exchanging the fiat currency for the digital currency. In both cases China seems to be having a greater advantage as compared to other economies in multiple dimensions.\n\nThe greatest fallacy when talking about China is to consider it as a government and a country. In this post, every caution has been exercised to see China as a geographic boundary that houses the People and not as a hierarchy that a nation is.\n\nBitcoin China – Made for Each other\n\nBitcoin industry’s greatest cost drivers and dependencies are the following listed below\n\nBitcoin mining is an energy intensive process – it consumes great many watts of electricity.\n\nTrade volumes dictate the price of Bitcoin.\n\nExchange fee rates that almost mimic the effect of interest rates by banks for fiat currencies.\n\nThe newer technologies, innovations and the repurposing of the blockchain technology, often brought to light by startups – the start up ecosystem matters to Bitcoin\n\nHow well/not-well are the fiat currencies doing in the macro-economic level of abstraction\n\nThe China Advantage\n\nIn relation to the five factors (not an exhaustive list) listed above that influence Bitcoin prices and stability, China has a few advantages:\n\nEnergy Costs: Energy is cheaper in China Trading Volumes: Bitcoin-Yuan comprises 80% of the global trading volume on Bitcoin exchanges; we covered this recently on Newsbtc. Exchange Fee Rates: Bitcoin exchanges in China, unlike the ones in most other countries, don’t charge a fee for trading. This incentive mechanism has a power of its own – as free is the best business model, and free sells easier than cheap. Although the Chinese government has banned financial institutions from getting mixed up with digital currencies, the Bitcoin startups are untouched. The intentional weakening of the Yuan by the monetary easing policy makes Bitcoin shine even more as a lucrative trading option.\n\nFor a country to increase its dominance on Bitcoin global market share, any one of the five factors listed above could suffice. China seems to have all the five factors coming into play at various proportions, that gives it indomitable control over what Bitcoin will become in the future for all of us. If all these are still unconvincing, this link http://fiatleak.com/ can point the reader to an interacting map of the real-time Bitcoin Trade activity visualization. It is hard not to see the dominance that China has over Bitcoin.\n\nPESTLE Scenario analysis of Bitcoin Dominance in China\n\nPESTLE stands for Political, Economical, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental.\n\nIn each of the above cases, ranging from Political to Environmental, China has multiple advantages. To maintain brevity in this long form article and for risk of stating the obvious, the political and the Social factors are the ones explored in detail. Here they are discussed in further depth.\n\nPolitical\n\nThe Government of People’s Republic of China is not entirely a poster-child of democracy. From the currency to conception, most of it is controlled with a long-term vision as to how the nation would function. This is a hard way to run a country given the increasingly free flow of information available to the youngsters in China. Bitcoin is information too. It is neither paper, nor plastic. Worse, Bitcoin currency is not even visible to the government’s eye.\n\nSecondly, Beijing is not comfortable with letting Yuan’s intrinsic value to float freely. This unfortunately or fortunately, reflects on the Bitcoin’s extrinsic value.\n\nSocial\n\nIt is extremely hard to move wealth out of China. It is by the very design of the economy and the collective behavioral traits, that it is kept that way.\n\nThis takes me back to an old article from 2013, by Business Insider, titled “Bitcoin Has No Intrinsic Value And Will Never Be A Threat To Fiat Currency”. Interestingly enough, the situations much like the ones in China with political and economic interference to wealth, has lead to Bitcoin gaining some intrinsic value of its own, in the minds of the Chinese beholders.\n\nOn a conclusory note, it is hard not to see the following about Bitcoin China and the Future!\n\nOne economy dominates roughly 80% of trade volumes of a global currency.\n\nThe future of this global currency that we call Bitcoin is still not concrete.\n\nThere is only a finite supply of Bitcoins.\n\nIt is hard not to see it coming. The BTC and PRC seem to be the future.\n\nThe question that we have to be asking ourselves and directing out mental energies to is this: Bitcoin (BTC) and People’s Republic of China (PRC) seem to be the future. Yes. The question is, in what combination and in what proportion? What is the failsafe for the rest of the world?', ""“Virtual currency is here to stay”, according to a partner at one of the largest and most prestigious law firms in the US.\n\nJudith Alison Lee, partner in the Washington, DC, office of global law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, was a panellist in the company's webinar on virtual currencies, which took place earlier this week.\n\nLee, who is also co-chair of the firm's International Trade Practice Group, said she isn’t putting all her faith in bitcoin as the virtual currency that succeeds over any other, but she does believe digital currency isn’t just a fad.\n\n“We think this type of technology, this method of payment, has so many advantages over fiat currency. It's unlikely to completely go away,” she explained.\n\nAccording to Lee, Gibson Dunn is also interested in other applications of bitcoin’s underlying technology, the blockchain, and she sees many applications other than currency coming to the fore this year.\n\n“We think that some of the most interesting applications, from a legal perspective, are the potential use of blockchain technology for smart contracts, securities, property registers, IP and the storage of other data,” she told CoinDesk after the webinar.\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nSpeaking about what else 2015 has in store for the digital currency space, Lee said she is certain there will be continued growth and acceptance by large mainstream retailers.\n\nHowever, she believes it is likely there will also be more headlines centered around price volatility, security breaches and bitcoin’s use in illicit activities.\n\nWith this in mind, Lee is confident more regulation related to digital currency will be created in the near future:\n\n“We do think there is going to be increased regulation at both the federal and state level … especially in New York, where you have a very active and aggressive regulator.”\n\nRegulation in the US\n\nArthur Long, partner in Gibson Dunn’s New York office – one of 18 across the globe – also took part in the webinar and spoke specifically about regulation in New York State and across the nation.\n\nHe said the state’s proposed BitLicence shows that “New York really wants to reach out and firmly establish control over virtual currencies”, adding that he believes many other states will follow the same approach.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“I expect, however, that the pace of state regulation will differ by jurisdiction, and we will not see rapid implementation of 50-state schemes like New York’s. That said, New York’s will be influential, and given the reach of the scheme, it will likely require many out-of-state companies to be licensed in New York.”\n\nLong, who is also co-chair of the Financial Institutions Practice Group at Gibson Dunn, believes this will slim down the number of players in the space, resulting in a only a handful of regulated exchanges operating in the US.\n\n“I think this will mean participants with the most financial backing and the most ability to deal with multiple regulatory requirements will come out on top over the next few years,” he said.\n\nInterest in the technology\n\nJeffrey Steiner, counsel in Gibson Dunn's Washington, DC, office, rounded off the webinar by discussing the general attitude the firm's clients have towards digital currency.\n\nHe said many have expressed a desire to learn more about how digital currencies and blockchain technology can work in the context of their business operations.\n\n“There's certainly a lot of interest,” he concluded.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Working out on the regular chisels your body, cranks up your immune system and staves off the grim reaper. But what if it paid financial dividends, too? What if you could literally get paid for getting ripped? Would you work out harder?\n\nSweat equity is taking on new meaning with FitCoin, a new palm-greasing iOS fitness app that Austin, Texas-based Chaotic Moon Studios is pumping up at SXSW this week.\n\nRelated: To Stand Out at SXSW, Give Them Something to Tweet About\n\nThe clever app, not to be confused with a little-known cryptocurrency and a host of other apps bearing the same name, motivates users to train harder in exchange for bitcoins. It’s beautifully basic: The more they work out, the more digital cash they stash.\n\n""This concept combines two of our specialties: looking good and making money,"" said Ben Lamm, Chaotic Moon co-founder and CEO. ""We\'re always trying to turn existing habits into new opportunities to make money -- this one was an obvious fit.""\n\nOn top of leveraging Bitcoin’s blockchain public ledger backbone, FitCoin also latches on to another hot new technology: Wearables. Specifically fitness trackers that measure your heart rate and offer open API software, reports Yahoo Tech. So far, the only trackers to meet both criteria are the Jawbone UP3, Mio Fuse and Austin-based newcomer Atlas.\n\nRelated: SXSW: Talking Vegetables, Selfie Pods and More Insane Products From SXSW\'s Tradeshow Floor\n\nAfter being paired with a tracker, FitCoin logs your workout intensity, duration and distance. From there, the app’s proprietary algorithm determines how much bitcoin you’ve earned during each workout session. The sleek black and white animated app also delivers real-time notifications and earnings updates, also displayed on a dashboard, so users can easily track “how both their body and their bank account are progressing.”\n\nBut don’t expect to get rich quick, even if FitCoin’s tagline is “Get fit, get rich, or die mining.” Only “slivers” of bitcoins are mined when you exercise.\n\nAlso, you’re out of luck if you hope to find FitCoin in the Apple App Store today. It’s still in early alpha release, yet “has already gained traction with enthusiastic users,” according to its creators. They envision FitCoin as a health incentive tool for everyone, not just “cypherpunks and fitness freaks.”\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: \'Days Felt Like Years\': What Morgan Spurlock Found When He Tried to Survive on Bitcoin for a Week\n\nFitCoin\'s creators say the project is a working proof of concept, therefore its cost and plans for monetization are still up in the air. ""Whether it’ll be app or fee-based remains to be determined.""\n\nFitCoin is the real-deal, not just another headline-snatching stunt care of the bold creatives at Chaotic Moon. The startup has earned a reputation for testing SXSW organizers’ patience more than once. Last year, the company shocked festival goers when it zapped an intern with 80,000 volts of electricity using a taser-equipped drone. Luckily, the intern wasn’t hurt, perhaps apart from a bruised ego.\n\nThis year, Chaotic Moon’s plans to pilot its newest and wackiest drone, Tyrone -- which it says “can tag a wall with spray paint, accost onlookers with silly string or deter attackers with a three-foot flame” -- were foiled by the festival’s new “strict no drones policy.”\n\nRelated: SXSW Declared a Drone-Free Zone', 'It is a well-documented fact that Africa has a huge number of unbanked, which in some countries goes beyond 70%, and also incurs very high costs of money transmission. It follows then that when Bitcoin is mentioned in the same breath as Africa, it is often as a technology that is in a position to help solve these problems.\n\nHowever, there is another opportunity in cryptocurrency that is attracting attention, at least in some quarters of the continent’s population. And that is being a source of income as a tradable currency online.\n\nA few weeks ago I was added to a Kenyan Bitcoin Facebook group, where members share all manner of information on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. And for the time I have been there, I noted that apart from how to get into mining, the other question that kept coming up is how one can trade Bitcoin online and generate income.\n\nIn line with this demand, TagPesa and BitPesa, two Bitcoin exchanges operating in Kenya have recently made efforts to facilitate online trading in bitcoins. Indeed, BitPesa did hold an event on February 13, 2015 dubbed ‘Hustle with Bitpesa’, which was specifically targeted at traders. Since then, the company has been holding similar events in other major towns around the country.\n\nThe same is being replicated in other African countries. The South African Bitcoin exchange ICE3X in January 2015 launched its services in Nigeria, which will help the locals buy and sell bitcoins using naira, the local currency.\n\nNew phenomenon\n\nOf course, it would accurate to say that online trading in Africa is still in its early age. Online Bitcoin trading will probably furthermore remain marginal for many years to come even as internet penetration grows at a relatively high rate.\n\nNevertheless, there is some activity taking place in this area.\n\nTech-savvy, mostly young people in cities like Nairobi, Cape Town and Lagos are taking the initiative to learn the ropes. I must mention however that almost all of these pioneers are people who have been trading online before using other methods.\n\nOne perfect example of such a trader is Nelson Lemashon, a Kenyan, who has been trading currencies on the ForEx market for close to five years. He decided to venture into BTC in 2012, and he believes there is an opportunity for Africans in this area too.\n\nChallenges\n\nLemashon acknowledges however that just like with other Bitcoin traders around the world, those trying it from Africa have to overcome a number of teething problems and other challenges.\n\n“We have to face the challenges of not well-developed trading tools,” says Lemashon. “For instance, apart from BTC-e, few other bitcoin trading platforms have the MT4 software. Also in order to leverage on volume, you have to invest a larger amount of value as compared to when trading other currencies or assets.""\n\nMichael Kimani, a founding member of the African Digital Currency Association, thinks that more Africans are going to interact with Bitcoin through trading.\n\n“It can happen as the means of moving money between local currencies and bitcoins are becoming available,” says Kimani\n\nIndeed, it will take time for a vibrant community of online Bitcoin traders to grow. However, with the continent holding its first Bitcoin Conference on April 16-17, 2015, and a growing list of exchanges opening up shop on the continent, there is little doubt that it will happen.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

With significant upgrades to its web wallet user experience, BitGo has also now made available many of the enterprise security features to individuals and greatly enhanced the ease of use of its secure bitcoin wallet software.\n\nCCN was able to interview CEO Will O’Brien about the changes.\n\nHaving BitGo free for individual is an important part of helping people learn about Bitcoin security and have peace of mind in managing their Bitcoins. With so much focus on bringing BitGo to businesses, what can individuals expect?\n\nBitGo has built the world’s most secure bitcoin web wallet. It’s multi-sig, HD at the core and risk controls like spending limits add critical security measures. We want everyone to be able to use this wallet, not just businesses, which is why we made it free for individuals.\n\nBitGo has made contributions to Bitcoin such as helping BitStamp after their recent hack. Why do companies want to use BitGo?\n\n\n\nCompanies are signing up in droves to build on top of the BitGo Platform API. It helps them get faster to market and start with the right foundation for security. We are really excited by the integrations from our customers and will have many more announcements of that type to make this year.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Exchange Bitstamp Is Back Online with Multi-sig Security after Hack\n\nThe enterprise division of BitGo is getting some updates as well from revamped pricing to better auditing capabilities. Businesses this last year benefited from BitGo’s aggressive moves to protect, like when they stepped in to save BitStamp after the popular exchange was hacked causing the loss of $5 million in Bitcoin.\n\nBitGo Delivers Security and Functionality\n\nThis announcement comes on the heels of several major moves by BitGo. Earlier this year, the company launched the BitGo Platform API™, a highly scalable set of tools and services that allow any developer to rapidly deploy state-of-the-art operational infrastructure for their bitcoin business. The BitGo Platform API has already been integrated by leading exchanges like Bitstamp and a host of consumer and enterprise services. BitGo, in partnership with C4, also introduced the CryptoCurrency Security Standard, a template for certifying the 10 fundamental aspects of cryptocurrency security. And finally, BitGo secured first-of-its-kind comprehensive insurance coverage for bitcoin theft from the global, A-rated XL Group insurance companies, offering a baseline $250,000 protection for all commercial customers.\n\nBitGo’s deal to bring insurance to the industry is historic. With so many companies entering the industry, will it be able to scale fast enough and high enough to meet demand?\n\nYes, we have structured the insurance policy so we can scale our security promise to our customers as demand scales.\n\nThe new Multi-Sig updates are quite interesting. What are some of the key elements you feel people and businesses should be aware of?\n\nFor businesses, we have added more capabilities to the wallet like transaction memos and address labeling. We have also greatly improved the security and ease of use of sharing wallets. Everyone will benefit from the new user experience which is a major upgrade in look & feel and usability.\n\nBitGo is continuing to work to offer the best protection they can for businesses and individuals. Their tools being so extensive and scaling up to the largest enterprise levels give them a broad reach in their industry. Will O’Brien is working hard with his team to promote Bitcoin around the world in their efforts to help people secure their Bitcoins. We will be watching to see what they do next and bring you the latest as it happens.\n\nWill you use BitGo’s multi-sig security tools for yourself or your business? What features do you still want to see from BitGo?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham has announced plans for his mobile gift card company to use bitcoin to enable gift card providers to issue more secure, consumer-friendly digital products.\n\nAnnounced at the annual SXSW conference, the news was revealed during a conference panel that sought to address the real-world applications of bitcoin, and included Boost VC CEO Adam Draper; Chain founder Adam Ludwin; and ChangeTip CEO Nick Sullivan.\n\nCurrently in the R&D stage, the technology standard would “tokenize” gift cards, allowing gift cards to be transferred between peers and other digital wallets by using colored coins, or bitcoin tokens, issued on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nLingham went on to suggest the standard would enable gift card numbers to change so that they were less susceptible to physical theft or tampering, something he called the project’s “radical” innovation.\n\nStill, he cautioned that the plan is still far from fruition, telling CoinDesk:\n\n“We’re months away from having a viable prototype, but we think it’s going to be good for the industry and great for consumers.”\n\nThe development is the latest for the mobile gift card provider, which became one of the earliest e-commerce platforms to accept bitcoin in May 2013. Lingham has since emerged as an outspoken advocate for bitcoin in the business community, having launched two unsuccessful bids for the Bitcoin Foundation board of directors.\n\nLingham said he has filed patents for related technology that will be revealed when the project is released.\n\nBlockchain opportunity\n\nThe announcement is also the latest vote of confidence extended by Lingham to the wider crypto 2.0 movement in the bitcoin space.\n\nIn addition to his duties at Gyft, Lingham serves as an advisor for decentralized application crowdfunding platform Koinify. Further, he recently invested in blockchain-based ID authentication service Trustatom.\n\nLingham explained that he sees the open ledger as the core innovation behind bitcoin, and the bitcoin blockchain as currently the strongest available. Gift cards, he said, could be issued on the bitcoin blockchain, which would help to certify and validate the data.\n\n""One bitcoin could be used to issue thousands of gift cards for a value greater than what the bitcoin is,"" Lingham explained. ""We can use this technology to make sure that consumer gift cards are protected, that counterparty risk is managed and that it’s compliant.""\n\nLingham stressed that in this way the blockchain could be used to limit the fraud risk consumers face, while removing the need for those assets to be tied to bitcoin and its fluctuating price.\n\nNo ‘industrial use case’\n\nLingham went on to state that the standard will help create a use case for bitcoin that could then in turn help to stabilize its notoriously volatile price.\n\n“There’s no industrial use case of bitcoin,” Lingham explained. “There’s no reason for anyone to have a bitcoin. What do you do with it? You can send money back and forth, sure. But it’s not like diamonds that can be used for cutting or gold that can be used in wiring.""\n\nThe CEO said that, going forward, bitcoin will need more use cases that seek to utilize its possibilities outside of value transfer, a market that can provide a reason for bitcoins to be taken out of circulation that goes beyond speculation.\n\n“Bitcoin becomes even more valuable when people are using bitcoin without knowing that they\'re using bitcoin. I think it becomes better for the industry,” he concluded.\n\nWrapped gift image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

When I look at my phone wallet, it\'s impossible to remember what [transactions] happened at the time unless I write it down. Just to have a graphical representation, to help you use bitcoin the right way, is going to be absolutely crucial to mainstream adoption.""\n\nExited an accelerator\n\nCoyno is a three person team comprising Hagen, co-founder Levin Keller and technology lead Leopoldo Godines. The startup won entry to the Axel Springer Plug and Play Accelerator in Berlin last November, leaving the programme three months later.\n\nThe startup received €25,000 as part of the programme, money that Hagen says has been spent on building the beta. The team is now bootstrapping the project.\n\nHagen says the idea for Coyno developed when co-founder Keller ran into difficulty compiling the records necessary to file his taxes for his bitcoin holdings.\n\nIn Germany, capital gains taxes are levied on bitcoin holdings if they are sold at a profit. The difficulty arises when gathering the records of bitcoin transactions, Hagen said.\n\n""It was just impossible to do,"" Hagen said.\n\nHagen says Coyno\'s current product acts as a ""bookkeeper"" for bitcoin holdings, but the plan is to introduce a tax reporting feature so that users can solve the very problem that inspired the firm in the first place.\n\nCoyno will operate on a \'freemium\' model, probably charging for features such as tax reports in future, Hagen said.\n\nTax reporting plans\n\nTax reporting will put Coyno in competition with software like LibraTax, which provides accounting software to ease the difficulty of filing taxes for digital currencies accurately in the US. Other software providers like Bitcoin Taxes offer a service for calculating an individual\'s cryptocurrency tax liabilities.\n\nHowever, Hagen says tax accounting will comprise just one product in Coyno\'s planned ""suite"" of digital currency analytics software.\n\n""Tax is a first step,"" he said.\n\nThe firm currently has 150 users in its beta, but Hagen hopes to increase this by tenfold within a month.\n\nHagen said Coyno has an advantage over other bitcoin startups because it never handles users\' private keys or their funds. The firm therefore doesn\'t have to dive into the thicket of regulations around anti-money laundering (AML) or know-your-customer (KYC) rules, or obtain financial licenses from regulators.\n\n""We never touch your private keys. You can do a lot of cool things [in bitcoin] without ever having to control people\'s funds,"" he said.\n\nThe Coyno co-founder said Germany suffers from a paucity of investment dollars for bitcoin startups. He pointed to the sole venture-backed bitcoin startup in the country at the moment, a firm called Bitbond, which raised $270,000 last August from Point Nine Capital and Nelson Holzer, according to the CoinDesk bitcoin venture capital database.\n\n""The Germans are very conservative,"" Hagen said. ""If they can drive it, if they can manufacture it, they will do it ... But to take the lead in something so innovative, they just don\'t have that kind of imagination. It has been quite difficult.""\n\nBookkeeping image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The Bitnodes project issued its first incentive last week and will continue to do so until the end of 2015 or until 10,000 nodes are running.\n\nThe program uses an incentive program started as an experimental process to reward those who run a node. Rewards for running full nodes are being paid in bitcoin.\n\nA Bitcoin node is a part of the network that allows Bitcoin to operate the way it does. It increases security and improves reliability by validating transactions and blocks and then relaying that information to other full nodes.\n\nAny individual can run a full node by using the Core client (Bitcoin Core).\n\nMiners, the ledger clerks of the Bitcoin sector, are incentivized by rewarding them for solving blocks. These blocks contain information about recent transactions and the reward (at the moment) is 25 bitcoin, which can be spread among those contributing toward the mining.\n\nBut there are no similar incentives for individuals or businesses running full nodes. They have only the gratification that they are supporting the network. And if they are not mining, others are being rewarded for it. This is a problem, as nodes are arguably as important as mining.\n\nAnother problem: Keeping a full node running for an extensive period entails cost. The hardware being used may be out of play for anything else, or the cost of electricity is significant after an extended time.\n\nThe Bitnodes project introduces the Peer Index (PIX) as a way to measure nodes in the network. It is based on 11 properties that can be found in greater detail here. Then nodes are listed on the leader board for all to view.\n\n“If your node is not already up on the leader board, make sure that it is reachable by other peers in the network and activate its node status from https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/nodes/,” said Addy Yeow of Bitnodes.\n\nThere are currently 4,006 active nodes. IP, ISP, client, country and more information is available via Bitnodes.\n\nYeow accedes that the incentives program is not an ideal solution to completely remedy the growth, or lack, of Bitcoin nodes. Further discussion is needed from the community for problem-solving and figuring out a more long-term solution to encourage individuals and businesses to run long-term nodes.\n\nRecent updates have extended the 60 day charts to 90 days, a full quarter of a year. This has been done to give a clearer picture of Bitcoin Core version adoption. Also, a STALLED alert has been introduced to notify node operators when their node has not downloaded a newer block from its peers for some time.\n\nOne of the long-term potentials of Bitnodes is that it could be used to estimate the size of the Bitcoin network that uses newer versions of Bitcoin Core (version 0.8.x or newer). A full list of the Q1 updates for Bitnodes can be found here on Github.\n\nThe potential for rewarding node administrators exists. Further incentive applications are probably needed, but there is scope for this future development. Involvement from the public is sought since the next gem of an idea can come from anyone.\n\nGetting Involved\n\nIf you want to get involved in the programming or the discussion, do so via Github here. The crawler implementation (in Python) is also available from Github and can be found here.\n\nEven if you are not a programmer or you do not think you can contribute to the discussion on development, you can always be part of the solution by running a node (bitcoin core) and leaving it running on an old computer in a spare room.\n\nIf you plan to run a node, you should have 50 gigabytes of free disk space, 2 gigabytes of RAM and an Internet connection with uploads of at least 400 kilobits (0.4 mb). Check regularly to ensure you do not exceed your upload limit (if relevant), and that you leave your node running for at least 6 hours a day.\n\nBitcoin nodes map via bitnodes.io', 'After earning the title of the worst investment of the year 2014, Bitcoin Trading may not need any further introduction when it comes to potential risks and losses. However at the same time, the market has been a haven for disciplined day traders that normally end up earning a greater returns within a shorter period of time.\n\nOne of the most attractive things about Bitcoin trading is the ability to use leverage. It gives traders an option to trade larger amounts even with small capital. In this context, the Bitcoin trading sector functions much like its experienced counterpart, the forex trading sector that also offers similar options to its traders.\n\nFor instance, a 50:1 forex leverage represents the ability of trader to place trades 50 times more than their actual capital. Similarly in, Bitcoin trading market, liquidity providers lets users open leveraged positions by providing their funds. These leverage ratios however are much lesser than those of forex, because of Bitcoin’s sustained high volatility. The maximum leverage we personally have came across is 50:1, provided by the Bitcoin exchange 796 and AvaTrade.\n\nWhile it is true that high leverage yields high returns, the same is applicable in the case of losses as well. For instance, if you hold the capital worth $1 and borrow $50 leverage to trade on the Bitcoin market, with 1 pip being 1/100 of a penny, then a move towards favorable upside price direction, say for 100 pips, would yield the profit of $1, or 0.1 percent. So if you would trade, say a larger amount like $50,000 on your original capital $1,000, you would end up making a whopping $5,000 return.\n\nBut in case the price action ditches your predictability, the loss would be as much as the profit. So a leveraged trade worth $50,000, decreased by 100 pips, would cost you $5,000 plus interests, therefore putting your account balance in negative.\n\nThe same is applicable when you bet on downside price direction, by calling a short position. However in this case, what you borrow is Bitcoin rather than cash so as to sell them at a peak. Later you buy the same BTC from the downside position for cheap, and return lenders the Bitcoin your originally borrowed while taking away the profits. In case the prediction becomes invalid and the price starts to move north, you become obligatory to buy Bitcoins back at a high to pay your lender with interest.\n\nBitcoin Volatility Increase Risks on High Leverages\n\nDay Traders are not serious investors, as they say. However, in terms of Bitcoin, investors are not serious day traders. We have seen how the cryptocurrency’s value has fallen from the overvalued $1,100 to an undervalued point within only a year — more or less. There will be no controversy in saying that many long term investors have got burned due to Bitcoin’s prolonged bearish phase, while many day traders meanwhile have made huge bucks by calling short positions.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to notice that only those professional traders managed to go home with profits who were limitedly dependent on leveraged trades. Indeed, they were focused more on managing near-term risks rather then fantasying massive returns. To cut a long story short, they understood how Bitcoin volatility could put a dent on their leverage if their prediction goes invalid; and therefore they borrowed less and played only for small gains by setting proper price limits.\n\nWe will be using a case study to demonstrate the impact of Bitcoin’s high volatility on leveraged trades.\n\nLast year, between 14th August to 18th August 2014, the Bitcoin price fell nearly $100 on all the major exchanges — an event that was famously referred as flash crash. Many experts interpreted the crash to have been caused by margin trading — a kind of leverage system that requires traders to deposit collateral to cover credit risk.\n\nMargin Trading critic Raffael Danielli blamed a certain exchange for causing such a drastic drop, saying that:\n\n“The fall below 400 was mainly due to a lack of bids in the order book and not because the market believed that the true value was below 400, as the rebound back to over 440 only minutes later basically proved.”\n\nThis is one of the most accurate cases for explaining a stiff situation for high-leverage trades that could be taking place in a highly manipulative and volatile environment.\n\nThere were still some who actually managed to avoid losses during such unannounced price movements. As the price crashed down to 400 from 500, many seasonal traders found this opportunity to call long positions on small leverage towards the upside risk 420. They eventually covered up their losses as the price literally bounced back above 420 to test the primary upside risk near 440.\n\nMoral of the Story\n\nIncreasing your leverages could simply introduce amplified volatility to your Bitcoin positions. Thereby, it is ideal to place minimally leveraged trades, like most of the professional traders do. Many Bitcoin exchanges themselves have reduced their leverage-equity ratios after facing Bitcoin’s extended downtrends last year. Deposit more money, make less trades.\n\nChart Credits: BrCapoeira', ""Former OKCoin manager of international operations Zane Tackett has announced he will join Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex.\n\nTackett became the latest public-facing figure to resign from OKCoin on 10th March.

03/17/2015,"['The number of active bitcoin users worldwide will reach 4.7 million by the end of 2019, marking a significant gain over the 1.3 million last year, according to a report from Juniper Research we received today. However, the report, “The Future of Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin & Altcoin Impact & Opportunities 2015-2019” notes that exchange trading will continue to dominate bitcoin use, with retail adoption largely restricted to niche demographics.\n\nRetail activity ‘extremely low’\n\nWhile a number of high profile retailers are enabling bitcoin payment, both online and offline deployments are extremely low. Dr. Windsor Holden, the report’s author, observed,\n\n“While average daily transaction volumes have increased by around 50 percent since March 2014, the indications are that much of this growth results from higher transaction levels by established users rather from any substantial uplift in consumer adoption.”\n\nThe report cites a number of factors that hinder growth, most notably the difficulty in communicating the concept of cryptocurrency payments to end users. In addition, bitcoin’s historical association with – and continued use by – criminals for illegal purchases and money laundering deters mass adoption.\n\nSupply side challenges\n\nAnother challenge: bitcoin hoarding by speculators can further restrict currency supply. In addition, a combination of cryptocurrency volatility, lower bitcoin yields and rising electricity costs can threaten bitcoin mining profitability.\n\nOther findings from the report include:\n\n• The introduction of licensed, regulated exchanges could stabilize currency values and increase retail transaction adoption.\n\n• The protocols behind cryptocurrency could be deployed in real-time transactional settlement.\n\n• “Pump and dump” currencies created solely as short-term investment vehicles continue to plague the altcoin market.\n\nThe whitepaper, “Will Bitcoins Bite Back?”, is available from the Juniper website along with further details of the full report and the attendant Interactive Forecast Excel (IFxl).\n\nJuniper Research, based in Hampshire, U.K., provides research and analytical services to the global high-tech communications sector, providing consultancy, analyst reports and industry commentary.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Rakuten, Japan’s largest online retail firm, has announced that it will soon accept bitcoin across its global marketplaces.\n\nThe company is putting its investment in Bitnet — a startup that raised $14.5 million last October — to work with this development. Bitnet, which was founded by ex-Visa execs and is rivaled by Coinbase and Bitpay, will initially be integrated into Rakuten’s U.S. marketplace to allow customers to pay in BTC.\n\nNext up, the new payment option will roll out in Germany and Austria, with other international markets to follow. Interestingly, there’s no specific mention of when Bitnet will be integrated into Rakuten Japan, which is the most prominent of its 12 country-specific services.\n\nLast year was a breakthrough year for bitcoin as a sea of established retailers, including Dell, Overstock and even Microsoft, hopped onto the cryptocurrency to give customers an alternative avenue for payments.\n\n“The integration with Bitnet’s platform will make Rakuten one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world to begin accepting bitcoin,” Rakuten said in a statement with no uncertain pride.\n\nNonetheless, this news is notable because it not only continues the momentum for bitcoin among retailers, but it could help position Bitnet as a credible alternative to the increasingly dominant duopoly that is Coinbase and Bitpay — both of which have raised significant venture funding, and own the most lucrative bitcoin retail partnerships.\n\nCoinbase is particularly well-floated, having raised $75 million in January in a round that featured several Wall Street institutions, including The New York Stock Exchange. Bitpay raised $30 million last summer in what was at the time the largest round ever for bitcoin startup. Coinbase has since nabbed that accolade — the U.S. company has raised more than $100 million in investor money to date.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', 'At the South by Southwest Interactive Festival, Chaotic Moon Studios, an Austin-based creative technology studio, demonstrated its fitness application called FitCoin, which rewards users in Bitcoin.\n\nFitCoin measures the length and intensity of a workout and converts it to CPU (central processing unit) time to a Bitcoin mining rig. The more users work out, the more Bitcoin they mine.\n\n“This concept combines two of our specialties: looking good and making money,” said Chaotic Moon CEO Ben Lamm in a press release. “We’re always trying to turn existing habits into new opportunities – this one was an obvious fit.”\n\nThe app syncs with a user’s fitness tracker to record vital variables from a workout, such as distance, duration, and intensity. Chaotic Moon’s proprietary algorithm then determines the amount of Bitcoins earned during each workout.\n\n“At Chaotic Moon we are interested in crypto-tech computing and decentralized services, and wanted to explore them through a prototype that leverages the blockchain as application, service layer and platform,” said Lamm in the release. “It was important for us to make this experience compelling, useful and obvious for users by bundling the blockchain with the quantified self: translating sweat into equity.”\n\nUltimately, Chad Derbyshire, Chaotic Moon Studios’ marketing director, hopes that FitCoin will be used to form its own digital currency, reported Yahoo Tech. Derbyshire imagines that individual companies could award dedicated athletes with their own digital currency, based on their fitness achievements.\n\nSpecifically, Derbyshire imagines that this technology would be particularly appealing to one of the studio’s clients: Adidas. He imagines Adidas could offer special access to merchandise that you could buy only with the digital currency you earn using the FitCoin app.\n\n“Adidas can say: These are proprietary shoes that only Bitcoin users or only FitCoin users, or only AdidasCoin users can get based on this currency.”\n\nJon Werner, Innovation Explorer at Adidas, said in the press release, “We are excited to see how cryptocurrency can motivate people to make their exercise and fitness routines a long term habit.”\n\nImages via Chaotic Moon Studios’ press release on PRNewswire', 'One of the longest-operating bitcoin startups has suffered a hot wallet attack that resulted in the loss of 150 BTC, or roughly $42,900 at press time.\n\nFounded by Ira Miller and investor Erik Voorhees in 2012, Coinapult announced the compromise on Twitter, advising customers to refrain from sending bitcoin to Coinapult addresses until the problem is resolved.\n\nCoinapult COO and CFO Justin Blincoe stressed that the hot wallet was used only for funds owned by the bitcoin wallet and service provider, and that no customer funds were affected.\n\nBlincoe told CoinDesk:\n\n“Our team is looking into all possible scenarios in regards to what happened.”\n\nThe hack is the latest in a string of high-profile breaches at exchanges including Bitstamp and CAVirtex, with the later ceasing its operations after password hashes and two-factor authentication details were lost.\n\nCustomers that may have sent funds to the hot wallet since it was compromised or who have more specific questions, Blincoe said, can contact Coinapult directly at support@coinapult.com.', 'Online retail giant Overstock has released new insight into the buying behavior of its bitcoin customer base, revealing bed sheets have become the demographic’s favorite item to purchase.\n\nThe top five items bought on Overstock with bitcoin are now sheets, donations to non-profits, headphones, cases and holders, and area rugs, respectively.

To create Counterparty on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, 2,100 bitcoins were “burned.” Since then, Counterparty has established itself as a go-to platform for p2p digital asset exchange. In fact, almost two-thirds of Bitcoin 2.0 startup crowdsales have been completed on the Counterparty platform in a never-before-seen, decentralized manner.\n\nCounterparty has now teamed up with MathMoney f(x) to launch symbiont.io, a fintech company looking to build the first issuance and trading platform for ""smart securities,"" or self-executing digital contracts that are stored on a blockchain.\n\n""We\'re excited about the positive impacts blockchain adoption will have in the systems that power modern finance, and we look forward to seeing this technology put into use in a way that increases transparency, liquidity, and the overall functioning of capital markets,” said Evan Wagner, one of the founders of Counterparty and the Managing Director of Operations at symbiont.io, in the announcement.\n\nNow, Counterparty is inspiring other companies, such as CoinDaddy, to build with the Counterparty protocol. The Counterparty team has also been busy, though co-founder Evan Wagner was able to answer a few questions about its plans, Symbiont, the split from Overstock’s Medici program, their new desktop wallet release, and more.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Can you tell us about your recently announced Symbiont project? How will this be similar/different from Medici?\n\nEvan Wagner (Counterparty): We founded Symbiont to address real problems that exist in the structure and operation of traditional financial markets. Our thesis is blockchain technology in conjunction with the development of smart securities can solve these previously intractable problems.\n\n“What we can say is that we are big supporters of Medici and we do not see them as a competitor.”\n\nSince we left the Medici project we have not had any communication with Overstock.com so we can\'t comment on what they are building or how they plan to execute on their vision. What we can say is that we are big supporters of Medici and we do not see them as a competitor.\n\nCT: Are you planning to hold a funding round?\n\nEW: We are in the process of closing our initial round of funding for Symbiont. We have taken a methodical approach to this round to ensure we build an investor base that is diversified and that provides strategic benefits beyond the capital they invest.\n\nThis platform is ostensibly geared for larger financial markets.\n\nCT: Do you think we will see Wall St. embrace such a platform or perhaps try to implement their own closed-source platforms, blockchains?\n\nEW: It really depends on the use-case. There are some benefits to a public, open-sourced blockchain that are irreplicable in a private, closed-source system.\n\nCT: You have also just released the beta version of your desktop wallet. What can this offer users in addition to the regular Counterwallet and what type of security measures does it use?\n\nEW: The biggest difference between Counterwallet and the desktop wallet is the fact that to run the latter, you don\'t need to depend on a remote server to be either reliable or honest. You can use a local copy of the blockchain and work completely trustlessly. You can also use a remote server (for instant installs) and do client-side transaction validity checking.\n\nCounterparty-gui is a user-friendly front-end to the reference implementation library, which has previously only been accessible via a command-line interface. It can generate and store your keys in many different ways, depending on what wallet backend you use (e.g. btcwallet). Its functionality is also extensible via a plugin system.\n\nCT: Back in late 2014, Ethereum’s virtual machine and programming language was ported over to CP. How has this helped the platform in terms of Smart Contract implementation?\n\nEW: The smart contract system is really not much more than that port itself and the integration of that port into the existing Counterparty codebase.\n\n“Ethereum isn\'t really obsolete, because it still has an innovative blockchain design[.]”\n\nCT: Robby Dermody has stated that “With Counterparty, Bitcoin will be able to do anything that Ethereum ever could.” Does this make Ethereum obsolete since the Bitcoin blockchain obviously has a lot of the first-on-the-scene momentum moving forward?\n\nEW: Ethereum is just two things at its core: a smart contract system and a new blockchain to host it. Ethereum isn\'t really obsolete, because it still has an innovative blockchain design, but 100% of the functionality of Ethereum is now available on Bitcoin with Counterparty.\n\nCT: Can you give us an idea of what else CP has in the pipeline for 2015?\n\nEW: Mainnet release of the smart contracts system, maturation of the codebase, and improvements to the Desktop wallet.\n\nNote: The following answers were answered by Jeremy Johnson, the founder of CoinDaddy, as Counterparty has no direct involvement with the 2.0 services company.\n\nCT: CP’s crypto 2.0 services company, CoinDaddy, has recently unveiled a free blockchain explorer for its users. How will this tool help users and what are the key features that will be supported?\n\nJeremy Johnson (CoinDaddy): The CounterpartyChain.io blockchain explorer helps in a few different ways.\n\nFirst, it makes the Counterparty platform a bit easier to understand by using friendly asset icons and presenting the data in a manner that helps users more easily visualize flow of assets between users.\n\nSecond, it helps by providing a free set of easy-to-use APIs, which allows anyone to start interacting with the Counterparty platform immediately and begin integrating assets into their projects and applications.\n\nFinally, the site offers some advanced features, like asset and broadcast enhancement, which make it easy for anyone to start tying blockchain data with more standardized information like contact, website, and reputation information.\n\nCT: What are enhanced assets like the CZAR asset and what are enhanced broadcasts?\n\nJJ: The Counterparty platform allows anyone to create an asset, enter a short description of their asset, and use it however they would like. However, for technical reasons, users are limited in their asset description to just 41 characters, which does not allow for much information.\n\nTo solve this problem we allow users to update their asset description to contain a URL, which points to a JSON file, which contains additional information on an asset.\n\nThe CounterpartyChain blockchain viewer takes advantage of this ability to associate extended information with an asset or broadcast and for any assets or broadcasts, which have been pointed at a properly formatted JSON file. The extended information is automatically loaded and displayed to the viewer.\n\nHere is an example of a normal asset, which has NOT been enhanced.\n\nHere is an example of an enhanced asset with additional asset information.\n\nNote: You can read the full recent interview with Jeremy Johnson here.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

It functions as a typical debit card with an amount already stored and payments can be made by deducting from the balance.\n\nSeveral companies such as BitPlastic and Xapo offer bitcoin debit cards, which allow clients to convert bitcoin to cash and withdraw from terminals. It also allows the owner to accept bitcoin payments using the QR code on the card.\n\nBitPlastic vs. Xapo\n\nReviewing these two companies offering bitcoin debit cards shows that this kind of payment does offer a lot of convenience. With this kind of debit card, one can withdraw funds anonymously and securely, with the blockchain ledger keeping track of transactions. This requires no ID check and can be easily integrated with an existing bitcoin wallet.\n\nBitPlastic offers a bitcoin to Paypal exchange, which it claims to be an almost instantaneous transfer of funds. Xapo did have a few problems during the launch of its debit card but the online access to the bitcoin portal and Xapo wallet did make things convenient for its customers.\n\nBitPlastic also has an affiliates program, which could allow its current clients to earn as much as 30% of the fees collected from referrals. Bitcoin shopping carts can be easily set up, as online sellers could include a button for its buyers to pay with bitcoins online with a few clicks of a button.\n\nOf course usage fees apply, with BitPlastic charging a 5% conversion fee from Bitcoin to send cash to the debit card card. The ATM usage fee is minimal at about $1.50 per transaction. Meanwhile, Xapo had a bit of a rut in extra fees during its launch, as consumers complained about additional costs associated with the plastic card printing itself.', 'Bitcoin mining operations have become cheaper these days, as the value of the cryptocurrency has been steadily declining. On Amazon.com, bitcoin mining rigs can be bought for less than $1000 while some startup companies claim that you can be able to run a bitcoin miner for lower electricity costs.\n\nSmaller ASIC bitcoin mining machines of approximately 1000-1115 GH/s cost roughly $500-700 per unit, reflecting how smaller-scale miners can be able to have their own technologies. The Bitmain AntMiner S5 claims to be the most power-efficient Bitcoin miner currently on the market and it also comes with a simple and straightforward setup process.\n\nBitcoin Mining Costs\n\nMeanwhile miner hosting startup HashPlex highlighted the increased energy costs that come with bitcoin mining operations, as these machines have to be plugged in and running constantly in order to generate cyrptocurrencies. This has led some to outsource their bitcoin mining activities, with third-party firms taking a cut out of the profits generated.\n\nHashPlex doesn’t own any hardware but it runs a data center that’s near a cheap source of power, thereby lowering the costs associated for outsourced bitcoin mining. The company takes a smaller cut compared to what an average American pays for electricity of1.88¢ per kilowatt-hour.\n\nAccording to the company, in exchange for $99 per kilowatt-month (less than 14¢ per kilowatt-hour), HashPlex does all the work of operating the hardware while you sit back and watch the bitcoins flow into your digital wallet. Customers can mine other altcoins and digital currencies through this system as well.\n\n“Traditional data centers are not really set up to do that in the scale you need to do it for Bitcoin mining. Traditional data centers are targeted toward less power-intensive machines,” explains HashPlex VP of Engineering George Schnurle.\n\nHashPlex has been taking orders since April last year and is enjoying a larger base of bitcoin miners in the past months.In addition to providing space and power, HashPlex uses management software that monitors miners and automatically reboots them in case of failure.', 'The leader of the Google labs that gave life to the Google Glass smart glasses is coming clean about where the program went wrong.\n\nGoogle X lead Astro Teller said at the South By Southwest Interactive festival Tuesday that the company put too much emphasis on the “Explorer” program, which got the smart glasses in the hands of early adopters, tech press and gadget evangelists. Teller said the Explorer program itself was a good idea, but it put “too much attention” on Google Glass before it was truly ready for primetime.\n\nTeller was pretty relaxed about the mistake, though.\n\nFrom Mashable:\n\n“We made one really great decision, and one not so great,” explained Astro Teller, the head of Google X division where Glass was conceived and managed, to a packed ballroom at SXSW Interactive. “The great decision was to do the Explorer program. The thing that we did not do well is that we allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, too much attention to the program.”\n\nGoogle (GOOG) posted revenue of $18.1 billion in its most recent quarterly earnings.', 'Ripple Labs CEO Chris Larson recently described Bitcoin as an “unneeded” currency, a statement that eventually ended up fuming digital currency supporters.\n\nThe statement came during an official interaction hosted by the Californian Banking and Finance Committee to discuss “Innovation and Transformation in Payment Technology”. Apart from Ripple Labs representatives, which also included the company’s CTO Karen Gifford, the committee also invited digital currency veterans like Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito and Coinbase Co-Founder and President Fred Ehrsam to present their views on future payment systems.\n\nWhile both Brito and Ehrsam advocated the benefits of decentralized payment networks like Bitcoin for the future of the finance sector, Larson and Gifford preferred to lobby only their company while ignoring Bitcoin in the process. From what we could gather, Ripple Labs’ focus was only on explaining the blockchain, while they completely sidelined the benefits of Bitcoin as a token that creates the incentives for decentralized networks.\n\n“We don’t think the world needs a new currency, we already have plenty,” Larson told the committee while referring Bitcoin. “The real innovation here is the ability to move money around. […] It is important we address the needs of the banks to move money internationally and domestically.”\n\n“Not cool, Ripple”, “declaration of war” were few of the many comments that came from the Bitcoin community soon after the Larson’s statement left the newswire.\n\nAn Introspect is Needed (OP-ED)\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ripple Labs are somewhat on the same page when it comes to enhance the traditional remittence sector. One cannot ignore how much the latter has done in reaching out to mainstream banking sectors and influence them to use a rather cheaper and faster cross border transaction protocol. On the other hand, Bitcoin has proven itself time-after-time as an epitome of decentralized transactions, a thing that even made the mainstream business news networks acknowledge its potential in shaping up the remittance market for unbanked individuals.\n\nThey both, indeed, hold a significant part in shaping up the futuristic payment technology, but in their respective ways. So therefore, it would be easier to impress the government representatives if both the technologies begin to represent each other, rather than only themselves. The dirty competition will simply confuse the regulators, while the cause of a better and fair payment system will lost its way.\n\nIts time the community lets go of unnecessary criticism and join hands to promote the technology that literally lies ahead in the future.']"
03/18/2015,"['Verto and Kimble, the administrators of Evolution Marketplace, have made off with the cryptocurrency sum as Reddit community cries foul\n\nThe administrators of a top deep-web marketplace have disappeared with over $12m worth of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, it emerged last night, in what appears to have been an “exit scam”.\n\nOn the website Reddit, a user called NSWGreat, who identified him- or herself as a moderator for the site, raised the first red flag in a post to the DarkNetMarkets subreddit marked “EVOLUTION EXIT SCAM”.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bitcoin made simple – video animation\n\n“I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been suspicious the past few days,” the user wrote.\n\n“I have admin access to see parts of the back end, the admins are preparing to exit scam with all the funds. Not a single withdrawal has gone through in almost a week.”\n\nNSWGreat said that he or she personally had $20,000 in Bitcoin currently in escrow at the site, and had confronted Evolution’s administrators – who go by the aliases Verto and Kimble – on Tuesday night. They then confirmed the scam, according to NSWGreat.\n\n“I am so sorry, but Verto and Kimble have fucked us all,” NSWGreat wrote.\n\nLess than an hour later, the site had vanished.\n\nIn an update, NSWGreat said: “Servers have gone down, including back up server for staff. I’m sorry for everyone’s losses, I’m gutted and speechless. I feel so betrayed.”\n\nEvolution Marketplace was one of the largest of a number of deep-web sites which grew up after the collapse of the Silk Road, which was shut down after its administrator, Ross Ulbricht – who went by the alias Dread Pirate Roberts – was arrested in 2013.\n\nBut while Ulbricht’s Silk Road, and many of the sites that followed in its footsteps, had a quixotic if libertarian bent, Evolution was always known as more anarchic and less scrupulous.\n\nOne vendor on Evolution, speaking anonymously to the Guardian, said they had been on the site for two years. “Now it’s gone; I just lost my career,” they said, adding that they had lost around $5,000 in the scam.\n\nBitcoin: will 2015 be a make-or-break year? Read more\n\nAnother vendor, also speaking to the Guardian anonymously, said that they had lost $50,000 worth of Bitcoin and felt “absolutely terrible”.\n\n“I have lost everything I had worked for over the past year. That was my retirement fund,” the user said.\n\nOn Tuesday night, hundreds of users took to Reddit to vent their frustrations at the scam, some even talking about hiring hit-men to murder Verto and Kimble. “After you kill them, fuck them. Fuck them in the ear,” one user wrote.\n\nOthers were more philosophical. One user – who told the Guardian that they had lost money they had in escrow for a deal on a hacked Xfinity cable account and some “liquid shrooms” – said it “sucks for the people that lost thousands”.\n\n“Peeps are screwed,” the user said, “but all part of the game I guess.”\n\nThe plot thickened as the evening went on. One user who goes by DeepThroat told Verto and Kimble on Reddit that they had 24 hours until he would start giving their identities to other users so that they could take revenge.\n\nDeepThroat posted a screenshot purporting to be from the thieves, offering $5,000 in exchange for silence, which was posted to Reddit with the reply: “Fuck you.”\n\nRevealing identities – a process known as “doxxing” – is utterly taboo in deep-web circles. However, DeepThroat implied in posts that the situation called for extreme measures. “Doxxing is forbidden and crossing that line is I don’t even know what. But in this case pressure has to be applied for them to realise they can’t walk away from this unscathed,” DeepThroat wrote.\n\n“If the consensus is for me to fuck off let it be, OK then. I don’t think it’s fair for people to be robbed like this.”\n\nThe Guardian has contacted DeepThroat to verify the claims, but has not yet received a response.\n\n• This article was amended on 23 March 2015 to remove a statement from a Reddit user that was found to be false.', 'The Government is to regulate bitcoin exchanges to stop their use as money laundering hubs, the Treasury said today.\n\nIn a report published alongside George Osborne\'s annual budget, the Treasury said the new regulation would support innovation and prevent criminal use of digital currencies. The proposals will be consulted on early in the next parliament.\n\nThe government will work with the British Standards Association (BSI) to develop a set of standards that will protect consumers, it said.\n\nThe Treasury also announced a new research initiative on digital currency technology, and said it would inject an additional 10 million pounds ($14.66 million) into the area.\n\n""Today\'s announcement is significant in that it brings bitcoin and other block chain technologies closer to mainstream adoption,"" said Tom Robinson, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association, which has been involved in the Treasury\'s consulation process.\n\nIn a discussion paper published in February, the Bank of England said that digital currencies such as bitcoin showed ""considerable promise"" and that they showed it was possible to transfer value securely without a trusted third party.\n\nThe bank also raised the question of whether central banks should themselves issue digital currencies.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters', ""Now, the book explains, think about using a debit or credit card: No actual dollars change hands, but the bank, a central authority, knows what you’ve bought and from whom, adjusts your balance to prevent double spending and charges a transfer fee.\n\nBitcoin software ingeniously mimics cash. It allows anyone to transfer \xadBitcoins to anyone else — securely, anonymously and directly — preventing double spending, and avoiding the involvement of a central privacy-invading authority that takes more than a nominal fee. It accomplishes this by means of the block chain, a distributed software ledger on the \xadInternet that keeps track of all Bitcoin transactions. The block chain and Bitcoin production are the hardest things to \xadunderstand, and the book explains them lengthily and well.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Part commodity (it’s scarce) and part fiat money (of no intrinsic value), it depends on the market, and its price has increased greatly since 2008, with dramatic commodity-like fluctuations. If or as it gets used more widely, its price will stabilize.\n\nThe authors enthusiastically cover the pros and cons. If you’re a libertarian, you’ll be glad that governments can’t print Bitcoins, and that you can send them to Julian Assange when Visa won’t. More broadly, Bitcoin can facilitate economic integration of the global poor, the roughly 2.5 billion adults who don’t have bank accounts. Foreign workers remit $500 billion home annually, and Bitcoin could eliminate the fees of 10 percent or more paid to middlemen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNegatively, Bitcoin scandals have \xadincluded crooked or incompetent businesses like Mt. Gox (a Bitcoin exchange that went bankrupt) and the online black-market drug-trading site Silk Road, shut down by the F.B.I. This sounds bad, but don’t forget that HSBC \xadrecently paid $1.9 billion to resolve charges of money laundering.\n\nThe authors conclude with a wishfully optimistic discussion of Bitcoin’s future. Entrepreneurs are gearing up. The \xadventure-capital firm Andreessen Horo\xadwitz is funding apps such as virtual wallets that allow you to spend Bitcoins easily. Some governments are beginning to regulate Bitcoin, others to ban it. Where will it end?\n\nUndoubtedly, easy methods of electronic\xad payment will soon arrive. The \xadbattle will be between centralized — think \xadApple Pay — and decentralized schemes. An anonymized decentralized Bitcoin currency will blur national boundaries and threaten capital controls, exactly what anarcho-libertarians want. But will Bitcoin really bring happiness and liberty? Having observed the unsuppressable libido of capitalism, I’m inclined to think that if Bitcoin succeeds, some corporation will hijack its anarchist roots and make a lot of money the usual way. Meanwhile, Vigna and Casey’s thorough, timely and colorful book is a rewarding place to learn about it all."", ""Very few people understand that once you deposit your money into a bank account, it is no longer your legal property. The deposits may be insured but there’s nothing to prevent the government from confiscating money held within the banking system. The most famous recent example of this was the “bail-in” carried out by the government of Cyprus, where funds were diverted from individual bank accounts to ensure the government didn't default on its debt.\n\nThis isn't strictly a third world phenomenon either. The US government, via the IRS, has regularly seized bank accounts belonging to small businesses and individuals who made deposits of less than $10,000, but broke no laws. This practice, known as civil forfeiture, has been denounced by Attorney General Eric Holder, but it’s difficult to reverse precedent of this nature.\n\nGold is one of the only assets to function as a medium of exchange and store of value over several thousand years. Physical bullion is also much easier to keep away from prying governments, especially when it’s outside the banking system. The problem, however, is that gold is cumbersome to store and not an efficient payment method in small transactions.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, digital currencies like Bitcoin are easy (often free) to store and convenient for even the smallest of transactions. The knock on digital currencies is that they don’t have an established track record of storing value. In fact, even though gold has been mired in a bear market since 2011, the yellow metal has dramatically outperformed Bitcoin over the past 16 months. One ounce of gold now buys 4 Bitcoins. At this time last year, one ounce of gold was only worth 2 Bitcoins.\n\nOne of the only similarities between digital currencies and gold is that they largely function outside the banking system. The lack of real alternatives for depositing excess savings is what props up the current banking system in the first place. China, which overtook India to become the world’s largest buyer of gold in 2013, is a great example of this financial repression. Real deposit rates in China have been negative in 15 of the past 22 years, so there’s little opportunity cost in owning gold. The Chinese also appear to have an affinity for digital currencies. A study from Goldman Sachs reveals that 80% of Bitcoin exchange volume is being conducted in Chinese Yuan (CNY), up from 50% at the beginning of this year. Bitcoin has long been seen as a loophole around China’s vaunted capital controls, and it’s proving to be effective considering the Chinese government banned banks from handling Bitcoin transactions in 2013."", 'UPDATE (19th March 0:00 BST): This piece has been updated with additional comment and information from BitFury.\n\nA former US Department of Justice official has been named to the board of strategic advisors at bitcoin mining firm BitFury.\n\nAs reported by the Wall Street Journal, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein will act as a regulatory and law enforcement liaison for BitFury. Currently a partner at Washington, DC-based law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP, Weinstein will serve in a private capacity while continuing his work at the law firm.\n\nWeinstein resigned from the Justice Department in 2012 during a Congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious, a failed gun-walking program that dates back to the Bush administration, and is believed by some to have contributed to an increase in Mexican gang violence and the murder of a US Border Patrol officer in 2010.\n\nDuring an interview with the Journal, Weinstein spoke favorably of bitcoin’s open transaction ledger and its potential role in law enforcement, noting:\n\n“The glass-half-empty view of the blockchain is that this is anonymous and we are never going to be able to track criminals, but the glass-half-full view is there is traceability and a real advantage in having every transaction in the history of the currency available.""\n\nWeinstein went on to suggest that there is a need for greater oversight of the bitcoin industry in order to root out what he called ""bad actors"" in the system.\n\n“It is in everyone’s interest for bad actors that use a new technology to be rooted out so that everyone else can enjoy the fruits of that technology,” he said.\n\nBitFury CEO Valery Vavilov said that the addition of Weinstein to the company\'s strategic board gives it an edge in Washington, explaining that he believes Weinstein will be well-placed to speak on behalf of the company and the bitcoin industry as a whole. He added that BitFury is also weighing the creation of a new office in Washington sometime in the future.\n\n“We are excited to add Jason Weinstein to our advisory board,” he said in a statement. “Mr. Weinstein’s extensive expertise in cybercrime is invaluable.""\n\nImages via Shutterstock, YouTube\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Facebook Messenger payments will roll out first in the United States over the coming months.\n\n“We use secure systems that encrypt the connection between you and Facebook as well as your card information when you ask us to store it for you,” says the Facebook announcement. “We use layers of software and hardware protection that meet the highest industry standards. These payment systems are kept in a secured environment that is separate from other parts of the Facebook network and that receive additional monitoring and control. A team of anti-fraud specialists monitor for suspicious purchase activity to help keep accounts safe.”\n\nFacebook doesn’t charge payment fees because it doesn’t have to monetize payments. For Facebook, it’s enough to keep users locked in the hugely popular Messenger app instead of switching to a dedicated payment service such as PayPal or Google Wallet to send money to friends.\n\nMessenger is one of the largest platforms in the world, with more than 500 million monthly users. And last year Facebook spent nearly $22 billion to buy WhatsApp, a separate messaging platform that now counts more than 700 million active users globally.\n\nThe new integrated payment features, which are fast, easy to use and secured by solid technology and operating practices, could make digital friend-to-friend payments and micropayments commonplace.\n\n“[C]onversations about money are already happening on Messenger,” as people chat about bar tabs, splitting dinner bills, and sharing the cost of an Uber, Facebook’s product manager Steve Davis told TechCrunch. “What we want to do is make it easy to finish the conversation in the same place you started. You don’t have to switch to another app.”\n\nGiven Facebook’s huge size and reach, the introduction of its payments feature is likely to disrupt the emerging market for instant P2P payments, notes The New York Times. And analysts said that if the payment system succeeded, Facebook would extend it to other types of purchases, such as consumers’ buying of products directly from advertisers.\n\nWith this announcement, the social networking giant seems to be claiming a place among the large companies that, according to the MIT Technology Review report, will be the big winners in the digital fintech arena.\n\nThe Facebook announcement doesn’t mention Bitcoin. But it would be technically easy to add a Bitcoin wallet besides a credit card, and send bitcoin payments to the wallet of the recipient. That leaves open the option for Facebook to integrate bitcoin payments.\n\nBlogger Jimmy Song suspects that bitcoin payments may indeed be part of Facebook’s long-term plan. He notes that David Marcus, the former PayPal president who now runs Facebook’s Messenger division, has been a fan of bitcoin for a long time.', ""SaruTobi creator Christian Moss has confirmed that the iOS game has been temporarily removed from Apple's App store.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Moss said that the tech giant had removed SaruTobi over concerns that users could mistake its in-game bitcoin with real bitcoin.\n\nThe game, which lets users swing a monkey from a vine in a bid to collect bitcoin tokens, tips users in real bitcoin and allows them to purchase animated coins with no real-world value for use in the app.\n\nMoss said that the issue had now been fixed and that the app is currently awaiting Apple's review.\n\nApple and bitcoin\n\nMoss explained that Apple had personally called him to notify him of the removal, a rarity that led him to believe it is paying increasing attention to bitcoin.\n\nThe news comes just two months after Apple first approved the retro-syle game, clarified its bitcoin policy and reinstated apps that had previously been banned.\n\nDespite having seemingly shifting its policy, Apple removed messaging service Wiper from the China version of its iOS App store following the integration of bitcoin payments two days ago.\n\nWiper CEO Manlion Carelli confirmed at the time that the removal was a direct result of the bitcoin integration, which had taken place earlier this month."", 'You can now do much more than chat, like, share and add friends on Facebook. This past Tuesday, Facebook announced that it was introducing a feature in Messenger that would enable users send and receive money. The initial roll-out will be in the United States. And it’s going to be free.\n\nThe first time that you send or receive money on Messenger, you will need to link a Visa or MasterCard issued by a US Bank to your Facebook account. After adding the debit card, you can then create a PIN to enhance security on your account. If you are using an iOS device you can also enable Touch ID, and like other secure platforms, you can also have additional authentication on your account.\n\nSending and Receiving Money\n\nTo send money:\n\nStart a message with a friend Tap the $ icon and enter the amount you want to send Tap Pay in the top right and add your debit card to send money\n\nTo receive money:\n\nOpen the conversation from your friend Tap Add Card in the message and add your debit card to accept money for the first time.\n\nThe transfer of money is instant though depending on your bank it may take 1-3 business days for the money to reflect on the account. The new payments feature is rolling out in the coming months in the US across Android, iOS, and desktop.\n\nFacebook has been processing payments for game players and advertisers since 2007. The social networking giant processes over one million transactions each day, including some that are done via Messenger. Facebook’s payment systems are secured in an environment that is separate from the rest of the Facebook network and are subject to further monitoring and control.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what further developments will emerge from this. Will Facebook add Bitcoin as a currency option? Or will the company launch its proprietary virtual currency? CCN has sought answers to these questions from the Facebook Press Office and is awaiting a response.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The 2015 South by Southwest Interactive, held March 13-17, offered an exciting glimpse into the future for cryptocurrency users. Products that generated the most buzz focused on security for bitcoin users and the general public. Here are the top five products that caught the attention of the judges, experts and the media.\n\nFitcoin\n\nFitcoin, an iOS app from Chaotic Moon Studios in Austin, Texas, allows users to receive bitcoin for workouts. Simply pair it with Mio Fuse, Jawbone UP3 or Atlas wearable technology. The app tracks the duration, distance and intensity of a workout in real-time. By calculating the energy spent working out into CPU time on a Bitcoin mining rig, users earn slivers of bitcoin. The company does not specify the source of the payment.\n\n“At Chaotic Moon we are interested in crypto-tech computing and decentralized services, and wanted to explore them through a prototype that leverages the block chain as application, service layer and platform,” said Ben Lamm, CEO of Chaotic Moon Studios in a press release. “It was important for us to make this experience compelling, useful and obvious for users by bundling the block chain with the quantified self: translating sweat into equity.”\n\nThe company hopes this app will appeal to the general public, possibly making digital currencies more popular. They also hope to collaborate with sports apparel companies such as Adidas to offer a discount to app users.\n\n“We are excited to see how cryptocurrency can motivate people to make their exercise and fitness routines a long-term habit,” said Jon Werner of Adidas Digital Sports.\n\nIt is still in an early alpha release phase but generated much buzz at SXSW 2015.\n\nCoinPip\n\nThe public might be familiar with CoinPip, the bitcoin payment option. Last year, CoinPip Pte Ltd. updated their system so transactions could be converted into 70 regional currencies. At SXSW 2015, the company launched an expansion of their SMS wallet. Users in the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia can now transfer money online to workers living in remote areas in Indonesia.\n\n“Bitcoin is moving on. The power is not just in the currency, but in the technology,” says Anson Zeall, co-founder/CEO of CoinPip in a press release.\n\nAlong with this latest expansion, the CoinPro is partnering with Melotic, a Bitcoin company based in China to bring a payment service to China.\n\nLooking ahead, the company will also add the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Turkey, Kenya and the Philippines to their service areas.\n\nLedger Wallet\n\nIn a promotional video filmed at SXSW 2015, Eric Larchevêque the CEO of Ledger, tells viewers that his company wanted to bring the best of the Smartcard technology to Bitcoin. The latest innovation is the hardware wallet, which provides protection against hackers and thieves. The device fits in the USB port of any computer. In fact, it resembles a memory stick.\n\nAs Bitcoin Magazine noted in February, the Ledger Wallet stores transaction keys inside the wallet so it is never stored in the memory of a computer. He claims that even if the computer is compromised by hackers or viruses, the bitcoin will be safe and users will still have full access to their Bitcoin account.\n\n“If we want to have mass market adoption, we need to have very secure and simple solutions so that people don’t get their bitcoin hacked or stolen by malware,” Larchevêque says.\n\nLedger Wallet was one of the featured start-ups in the SXSW 2015 Accelerator Pitch-off. The event is designed to allow technology start-ups in the early stage to pitch their products to investors, media and experts. It was a finalist in the Innovative World Technologies Category.\n\nIt is available for sale on their website.\n\nAnchorID\n\nAnchorID was selected as an alternate in the Innovative World Technologies category at 2015 SXSW Accelerator pitch competition. This platform helps users create a universal login to access sites across the web. Thus, it eliminates the need to remember their usernames and passwords. Users can choose to use Smartphone authentication or biometric technology, such as fingerprint or voice recognition.\n\nThis patent-pending platform is limited to sites and apps that accept it. With the ever-increasing possibility of mobile malware infecting payment systems, AnchorID claims to offer a secure enterprise authentication.\n\nDigify\n\nDigify allows users to maintain control over shared content.

03/19/2015,"['HM Treasury, the U.K. government’s economic and finance ministry, intends to apply anti-money laundering regulation to digital currency exchanges in the U.K. as part of a plan to promote the legitimate use of digital currency. The goal, according to a newly-released 28-page document, is to support innovation and prevent criminal use.\n\nThe new document comes in response to a public call for input published in November on developing digital currency regulations. That call generated 120 responses from digital currency developers, businesses providing digital currency related services, banks, payment scheme providers, academics, consultants, and other government agencies.\n\nThe document summarizes the submissions and outlines the government’s next steps. It discusses the benefits, risks, and barriers to digital currency businesses, and options for government involvement in supporting digital currency.\n\nGovernment supports digital currency\n\n“The government considers that digital currencies represent an interesting development in payments technology, with distributed, peer-to-peer networks and the use of cryptographic techniques making possible the efficient and secure transfer of digital currency funds between users,” the document states. “The government notes that the potential advantages are clearest for purposes such as micro-payments and cross-border transactions.”\n\nThe government will look at how to ensure that law enforcement agencies have the skills, tools and legislation needed to identify and prosecute criminal activity relating to digital currencies. It wants to be able to seize and confiscate digital currency funds where transactions are for criminal purposes.\n\nPart of the plan going forward is to work with the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the digital currency industry to develop voluntary standards for consumer protection.\n\nResearch initiative to begin\n\nA new research initiative will bring together the Research Councils, Alan Turing Institute, and Digital Catapult with industry to address opportunities and challenges for digital currency technology. The government will increase research funding by £10 million.\n\nWhile there are barriers to digital currencies achieving widespread use in their current form, the government notes the “distributed ledger” technology that underpins digital currencies has significant promise in payments technology. It wishes to foster a supportive environment for legitimate businesses so the U.K. can realize some of the benefits of digital currencies. It also wishes to discourage illegal activity. At this stage, the government’s goals are as follows:\n\nTo provide clarity and certainty on the application of existing legislation and regulation for users, businesses and other parties dealing with digital currencies.\n\nTo limit opportunities for criminals or terrorists to use digital currencies for illicit activities, and to support the effective identification and prosecution of illicit activity.\n\nTo create the best environment for legitimate digital currency entrepreneurs to flourish. Such an environment includes supporting the provision of banking and other financial and professional services to legitimate digital currency firms.\n\nTo support the research, development and application of new technology, to promote competition and innovation in payment systems, financial services, and other relevant sectors.\n\nTo support monetary and financial stability in the U.K., by monitoring the usage of digital currencies in the U.K. and assessing the risks posed.\n\nAlso read: British Chancellor George Osborne buys into bitcoin\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nFocus on decentralized schemes\n\nThe earlier call for information defined a digital currency scheme as one which incorporates both a decentralized payment system and a related currency. It noted that digital currency systems can achieve consensus through a variety of means, including proof-of-work and trust-based consensus. The document focused on decentralized digital schemes because of interest in the potential benefits of the distributed ledger technology.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Last week Bitcoin Magazine reported that IBM is considering adopting the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin to create a digital cash and payment system for government and central banks. Now another technology giant is joining the digital fintech technology race: Intel is planning to investigate the potential of blockchain technology.\n\nIntel has posted a job announcement for a new researcher to join its special innovation projects group to “investigate hardware and software capabilities that advance the performance, robustness, and scalability of open, decentralized ledgers.”\n\nWorking with a team of distributed systems, operating systems, and security technologists, the selected applicant will focus on the development of cutting-edge, cryptographic algorithms for improving the robustness and assurance of transaction verification within an open, decentralized ledger, according to Intel.\n\nApplicants must be qualified in the areas of crypto algorithms, access control models and security/privacy protocols, proficient in the development of system and application software and familiar with relevant security and cryptographic standards.\n\n“These two tech giants [IBM and Intel], whose technology powers many of today’s most loved products want to get in on the technology behind bitcoin,” notes Upstart Business Journal.\n\n“The jury may remain out on the value of bitcoin as a currency, but the underlying blockchain technology has attracted interest from central banks, the financial services establishment and tech titans,” reports Finextra, commenting on possible blockchain fintech developments at IBM and Intel. “Chip giant Intel is also dipping its toes.”\n\n“Digital currencies like Bitcoin have captured the imagination of the press,” notes the Intel post. “Related startups are generating a great deal of VC [venture capitalist] interest and investment because of the potential significance of any disruption of the financial payment industry. Its fundamental technical innovation is the decentralized transaction ledger called the ‘block-chain.’ It allows bitcoin to prevent double-spending of currency by recording all transactions in an open ledger without the need for a central authority. Such a distributed, public, secure, peer-to-peer transaction record enables not just the exchange of bitcoins but many secondary uses that the research and startup community are exploring such as digital marketplaces.”\n\nReading between the lines of the Intel job announcement and speculating on the possible future involvement of Intel in blockchain-based fintech products, it appears that the chipmaker intends to focus on the security-related aspects of blockchain algorithms, possibly in view of the implementation of appropriate security frameworks in future Intel chips. The possibility of secure “Intel Inside” hardware wallets comes to mind, as well as noncurrency applications such as authentication and voting systems.\n\nThe cryptographic researcher will be based at Hillsboro, Oregon. The site hosts a Research and Pathfinding Laboratory where employees develop silicon technologies that are two to three generations ahead of Intel’s current manufacturing processes, and develop new ways to make digital technologies faster and easier to use.\n\nThe site also is home to Logic Technology Development, Components Research, and Design and Technology Solutions groups, responsible for developing advanced integrated circuit technologies and designing key components of microprocessor products.', ""The rise of online drug markets have led to a new form of drug dealing. Rather than gravitating to dark alleyways, dealing can now be done sitting in bed in one’s underwear. That doesn't mean drug dealing is any less of a risky businesses though. People get cheated all the time. Case in point: on Tuesday, leaders of Evolution, one of the largest online drug markets, shuttered the drug market and ran off with all user funds.\n\nEvolution, like other online drug markets, used bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Leaders Verto and Kimble ran off with an estimated $12 million in bitcoin. The shuttering of its doors could be a major reason the price of bitcoin took a nosedive from around the $290 mark to around $255.\n\nSome lost a huge chunk of money in the swindle. “I have lost everything I had worked for over the past year. That was my retirement fund,” one user said.\n\nThe underground bazaar filled the void of other closed markets such as Silk Road and Silk Road 2.0, but it was known as a darker version of its predecessors. For example, identity theft was a thriving business on the eBay-like market. One user named DeepThroat threatened to 'doxx' (to make someone’s identity public on the internet) the fraudsters, something that is frowned upon, but nothing seems to have come of these threats.\n\nOf course, this is nothing new. Atlantis, another dark market, turned out to be a scam. Drug dealers lost when Silk Road was shuttered by the FBI. “Great. I've lost on SR1, BMR, Sheep, Cannabis Road, and now Evo[lution]. Except this time I lost all I had. So maybe it's a sign to move on from the DNM. Fucking fuck me running,” one user said. When the price of bitcoin plunged early this year, drug dealers also panicked.\n\nThe future of online drug markets\n\nSome are saying that OpenBazaar, a more decentralized market which also uses bitcoin, might be the future for online drug dealers. Critics roll their eyes and insist that the market isn't intended for drugs. It's an open source project though, and that means anyone can fork the code and modify it. OpenBazaar is a fork of DarkMarket which had a more ambiguous, and perhaps “darker” purpose in mind, after all.\n\nIf history is our guide we can be pretty sure that online drug markets will continue to thrive. Perhaps they'll even multiply. As long as there are people willing to take the risk for profit, and the anonymizing browser Tor lives on, these markets will probably stick around.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Although bitcoin remains mysterious and confusing to most people, there are signs nearly every day that bitcoin is gaining more and more legitimacy, not only in technology circles but also amongst the mainstream.\n\nBitcoin was pegged in a report by Goldman Sachs as having the potential to reshape the financial industry, in large part due to the way the currency decentralized the movement of money. If that’s not enough, just recently one New Hampshire legislator introduced a bill that could lead to the state accepting bitcoins for taxes and fees.\n\nBut in order for bitcoin to truly hit the masses, it will need to be integrated into the services that people use everyday. As it turns out, there are a number of entrepreneurs and startups with the common goal of bringing bitcoin to more places, apps, and services:\n\nCoinbase - A consumer-friendly bitcoin wallet and payment platform.\n\nBacked by $106 million in investor funding, Coinbase recently opened the first bitcoin exchange based in the U.S. Customers can buy and sell bitcoins from Coinbase, which in turn purchases the coins from other exchanges and stores them on the customer’s behalf. The company has partnered with companies like Time Inc. and Dell to facilitate bitcoin purchases by acting as a go-between and converting bitcoins to cash.\n\nCoinbase is now entering the exchange market too, hoping to provide legitimacy and security that foreign competitors have lacked. Japanese exchange, Mt. Gox, an exchange that once handled 70 percent of all bitcoin transactions, lost nearly $500 million in bitcoins in a hacking attack and closed in 2014. In January 2015, UK-based exchange Bitstamp lost nearly $5 million when its wallet system was breached.\n\nCoinbase has tried to allay these fears by winning government support and advertising its safety features. The company has spent about a year working to satisfy regulators, and Coinbase says its customers’ bitcoins are insured against theft.', 'Newnote Financial, which is publicly traded (CSE: NEU; OTCQB: NWWTF; FSE: 1W4) on three international stock exchanges on two continents, has acquired Canadian Bitcoin exchange CoinTrader.net. In addition to its trading platform, CoinTrader has Bitcoin ATM machines in London and Tokyo, as well as a point-of-sale system called CoinZero. The deal was made for 1.5 million Canadian dollars in cash and stock, and was confirmed for CCN on Thursday morning.\n\nAlso read: AllCrypt.com Bitcoin Exchange Goes Down\n\nFounded almost two years ago by Vancouver group Bitcoiniacs, CoinTrader.net is the second-largest Canadian exchange by volume and will now be the first in the world to be traded publicly on three separate exchanges. At time of writing, Newnote stock was trading at $0.15 CDN, ~$0.09 USD and $0.14EUR, respectively.\n\nPureTrade is Now CoinTrader\n\nAcquisitions of solvent assets which expand a company’s operations into new territories have a way boosting a stock’s value. However, nothing is guaranteed. This acquisition, however, goes in line with Newnote’s core business model, and the exchange will be in addition to the Bitcoin gift card and mining businesses already under their control.\n\nIt seems that rather than continue the arduous process of developing their PureTrade Bitcoin trading platform, Newnote has decided to acquire the existing CoinTrader exchange. This statement is based on the fact that PureTrade.ca now redirects to CoinTrader.net. This could signal to traders that the company is not apathetic about getting results, but rather willing to take a pragmatic approach to its expansion.\n\nExpanding Business Widely\n\nVogogo, Inc. will be assisting Newnote in expanding operations of the exchange into all fifty US states, as well as numerous European countries. The exchange already had 10,000 active accounts as of writing with a regular growth of 1000 per month. Providing a new alternative for fiat-to-Bitcoin transactions will inevitably net a great deal of fees for the firm, especially considering the recent influx of US traders as a result of recent announcements on Wall Street such as hedge fund BIT‘s entry on the NASDAQ Exchange.\n\nThis move was ahead of other similar moves to be made by the Winklevoss Twins. More firms and interests are expected to make moves into the Bitcoin space as time goes on, which has given the recently depressed market a bullish feeling overall.\n\nNewnote CEO and President Paul Dickson was ecstatic about the news, saying,\n\n“This transaction positions Newnote as the de-facto leader in the crypto-currency space in Canada. Cointrader.net, CoinZero and the ATM network offer our shareholders direct exposure to the primary revenue generators in the digital currency space; it is our mission to deliver on our promise to offer the most innovative products and services available.”\n\nMarketing Budget Exponentially Increased\n\nOne of the benefits to CoinTrader.net will be the assets of Newnote, which translates to a massive marketing campaign to come following the announcement. The field of Bitcoin exchanges is already heavily saturated, with one major exchange (BitStamp) far in the lead, so a targeted advertising campaign will be necessary.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Coinigy has raised $100,000 in private seed funding to expand its suite of bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading tools.\n\nLaunched by former hobbyist traders William Kehl and Rob Borden, the US-based company allows users to aggregate pricing data at 24 bitcoin exchanges through a central interface that includes real-time charting and technical analysis features.\n\nIn addition to popular bitcoin exchanges such as Bitfinex and Coinbase, the platform also supports exchanges that trade more than 100 altcoins.\n\nKehl explained that Coinigy is designed to help traders better respond to changing market conditions, thereby allowing them to trade more effectively.\n\nKehl told CoinDesk:\n\n“It's definitely a benefit to traders in terms of increasing their profitability. We offer special order types that most exchanges don't offer like trailing stops and stop losses, so those things can definitely help preserve profit.”\n\nBorden added that Coinigy will be looking to use the funds, in part, to complete the development of Android and iOS apps that he estimated will be out within months.\n\n“We definitely have in our plans in the near future to branch out. We're vetting translators at the moment,” he added.\n\nCoinigy is currently available in English and for desktops only.\n\nFeatures\n\nCoinigy’s co-founders discussed a range of features planned for the platform, including those available and soon-to-be released.\n\nFor instance, Coinigy now offers stop limits orders, and plans to introduce stop-loss orders and trailing stops that would be available on all its supported exchanges.\n\nTo access the service, users first need to supply Coinigy with their public and private API keys. “That gives them the ability to control the access of the site through our account, and at any time, they can disallow that access,” Borden added.\n\nCoinigy does not hold any customer funds or keys, nor does it interrupt or bypass the anti-money laundering (AML) or know-your-customer (KYC) protections of the exchanges it supports.\n\nFurther, the founders sought to stress that they won’t be trading through the service owing to the conflict of interest that would arise.\n\n“We want to make it clear we're not trading for profit on any of these exchanges as we are privy to user information,” Kehl added.\n\nCompetition\n\nAs with most entrepreneurs, Kehl was quick to point out the limitations of similar services currently available on the market.\n\nThe co-founder cited CrypTrader, Cryptowatch and Bitcoin Wisdom as similar projects that also provide real-time charting, news feeds and technical indicators, though he suggested they are limited in terms of the functionality they provide.\n\nTradeBlock, the data provider backed by Andreessen Horowitz, he suggested, is too focused on enterprise customers, leaving a gap Coinigy intends to exploit.\n\n“TradeBlock could be considered a competitor, but they're mostly focused on institutional traders. We're catering to both institutional and average investors,” he said.\n\nCoinigy intends to monetize its product through subscriptions to its platform, priced at roughly $280 at press time.\n\nImages via Coinigy\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The mobile wallet provider has invented a one-step process that merges the functionality of an app like Google Authenticator directly into their Bitcoin wallet. CEO Paul Puey told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“We believe even the slightly technical people will understand the benefits of 2FA. As a bitcoin evangelist, I wanted to recommend 2FA to people, but knew they would be turned off by it. With this level of simplicity, I have no hesitation anymore.”\n\nNo longer does a user need to go through the complicated process of opening a separate authenticator app, transferring a seed to connect it with their device, then each time they log into their wallet, entering a six-digit code from the authenticator, along with their login and password.\n\nThe Airbitz app simplifies the process by generating one-time use tokens and sending them with each server interaction, tying a user’s account with their current device. No other device will be allowed to authenticate. A user can add additional devices by scanning a QR code on the original 2FA-enabled device.\n\nIf a user loses their device, they can log into their account through a new one and request a 2FA reset. The transfer process will take seven days and use push notification warnings to prevent a fraudulent reset.\n\nTwo-factor authentication can be discouraging for all but “crypto geeks,” delaying Bitcoin adoption because it seems too complicated for most people to keep their digital currencies safe.\n\nThe computer-access control method requires a user to present authentication factors from two categories—possession (such as a device with an authentication app) and knowledge (such as a username and password). A user must have both, making it is less likely for an attacker or unauthorized person to gain access.\n\nThe wallet’s other security features include a 10-digit password and six recovery questions. Puey says these features are not required, and are not part of the new account process. He explains:\n\n“Our wallet creates a popup after the user receives more than 100 mBTC in their account. The popup suggest that they complete the password recovery process, but it still isn’t required then. We think this is a great balance between a fast onboarding process and promoting good security and safety features.”\n\nAirbitz realizes that their “password recovery process is tedious and challenging” for some users and he says they’re working to improve it. They are developing a “faster, simpler, and still incredibly secure Password Recovery 2.0” that will make recovery a matter of answering two “very easy” questions.\n\nA year ago, Airbitz launched their business directory, which made it easy for Bitcoin users worldwide to find local businesses that accepted the currency. Ease of use is the company’s core focus, along with privacy and autonomy. The app continues to require no email, phone number, or personal information, allowing for 100% user control over their Bitcoin.\n\nThe “one-touch 2FA” update is available for both Android and iPhone.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The public assumption is simple, saying something as innocuous as “bombardier” might be a trigger word that could result in a wiretap without a warrant. While this may very well be the perception in the United States, thousands of criminal networks are still operating regardless of the increased reach of government surveillance. Drug dealers, human trafficking syndicates, prostitutes, and child pornographers are all able to sell, market, and distribute their services and wares openly online and through alternative forms of communication and mechanisms for transactions.\n\nWhile it is common knowledge that law enforcement surveillance in the United States has increased in recent years, most assume that it was primarily a policy response to the tragedy on 9-11. Within the field of criminology, theory and empirical research provide an evidentiary basis that accompanied this policy shift. Specifically, Routine Activities Theory provides a framework for focusing on surveillance to prevent crime. According to Routine Activities Theory, crime occurs where a motivated offender, victim, and lack of a capable guardian converge in time and space. While earlier solutions to addressing these crimes focused on incapacitating, rehabilitating, or otherwise deterring the “motivated offender,” more recent strategies focus on strategically deploying “capable guardians” or law enforcement to areas with high concentrations of crime, called “hot spots.” A “capable guardian” can be an actual law enforcement officer, a camera, or something as simple as a streetlight to increase visibility. Theoretically, having strategically placed surveillance or “capable guardianship” prevents crime.\n\nBorne from routine activities theory, “hot spot policing” focuses on the provision of capable guardianship at high crime locations. This technique is recognized as an evidence-based innovation within the field of criminology and policing. Hot spot policing research is supported by millions of federal and state grant dollars, the topic of hundreds of peer-reviewed articles in top-ranked journals, and recognized with the most competitive awards in criminology, such as the Stockholm prize. This research provides rich evidence to suggest that police should focus their resources on the location of crime as opposed to the offender. When focusing on the individual or motivated offender, police are always chasing a moving target. Instead, police can better allocate resources toward areas with high concentrations of crime, called “hot spots”. These “hot spot” crime locations are stable over time and research suggests that patrolling these areas decreases crime without geographic displacement. Collectively, crime and place scholars claim that crime just does not move around the corner, and police can make a measurable impact on preventing crime by focusing on geographic concentrations.\n\nA growing body of hot spot policing literature empirically validates the Routine Activities theoretical framework and associated “hot spot policing” solutions. These studies suggest that crime is in fact concentrated in small units of geography or “hot spots,” and deploying capable guardians to these “hot spots” is shown to result in strong reductions in crime. The idea that crime is concentrated in to relatively few micro units of geography was initially supported by the work of Lawrence Sherman et. al. Using spatial data on 323,979 calls for service to police in Minneapolis, MN over one year, Sherman, Gartin, and Buerger (1989) found that 3% of the street addresses produced 50% of police calls for service. Over the years, this spatial relationship was substantiated with new and more rigorous research. Using data on drug crimes in Jersey City, NJ, Weisburd and Mazerolle (2000) concluded that 4% of street segments generated approximately 50% of narcotics arrests, as well as a greater proportion of serious crime and disorder problems. Weisburd, Morris, and Groff (2009) corroborated this pattern with their study, which analyzed juvenile arrest data in Seattle, WA over 14 years. Their longitudinal study found that 50% of arrests occurred in less than 1% of street segments. Using a trajectory analysis of the Seattle, WA juvenile arrest data—which included over 1.5 million incident reports linked to almost 30,000 street segments—Weisburd, Bushway, Lum, and Yang (2004) established that geographic crime concentration is stable over time, with 4?5% of street segments accounting for approximately 50% of crime over 14 years. These data provide strong empirical evidence that the majority of crime is concentrated to relatively few geographic places.\n\nIn developing a response to these findings, scholars evaluated the efficacy of deploying police to crime “hot spots,” a strategy termed “hot spot policing”. Koper (1995) examined the residual deterrence effects of police patrols in crime “hot spots” in Minneapolis. His study established that the optimal dosage of preventative patrol was 15 minutes, which led to statistically significant reductions in crime. Similarly, Weisburd, Wyckoff, Ready, Eck, Hinkle, and Gajewski (2005) found that by deploying limited police resources to crime hot spots in Jersey City, NJ, they were able to reduce prostitution and drug crimes significantly and effectively. In fact, they found that the beneficial reductions in crime were actually diffused to the surrounding geographic catchment areas as well. Given these findings, researchers and practitioners in the field of criminology have begun to conclude that crime just doesn’t move around the corner; police can effectively deter crime by directing patrols to crime “hot spots.”\n\nThe Virtual Displacement of Street Crime with Tor\n\nAlthough a growing body of experimental research supports the conclusion that hot spot policing can effectively prevent crime on the street, how does this surveillance affect “street crimes” that occur online? Arguably, the surveillance reach of the government may fall short of providing capable guardianship online. Services that make users virtually anonymous like The Onion Router (Tor) stifle government investigation and policing. Theoretically an Internet user’s IP address serves as their virtual identification. In a perfect world for law enforcement, anything an Internet user did or said online could be traced back to their real identity and location using their IP address. However, computer savvy criminals can easily use the IP addresses of others by hacking into computers remotely. As a result, when law enforcement does track a particular illegal activity back to an individual IP address, it may be that of an innocent victim of virtual identity fraud, not the criminal himself or herself. Alternatively, for the less than adept criminal, The Onion Router (Tor) can automatically provide virtual anonymity to anyone who simply downloads and uses the Tor browser package. The browser facilitates anonymity by constantly bouncing the IP addresses between users across the world and periodically erasing the trace memory. Technically, information accessed or distributed through Tor travels through encrypted layers of the network and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) or autonomous systems (ASes) that control multiple routers, such as ISPs (Internet Service Providers). At present there are over 3,000 relays randomly used to encrypt the identity of users to and within the Tor network. While the Tor service may have an important legitimate purpose by protecting the civil liberties of users, such as whistleblowers or journalists, we would be remiss if we did not recognize the implications for criminal enterprise.\n\nTo illustrate the anonymity provided by Tor, a series of Tor browser login attempts were recorded by documenting the masked IP addresses and associated locations. Although the IP address for each user changes after every login, it should be noted that some of the routed IP addresses are eventually repeated. In this series, three IP addresses from France, Canada, and an unknown location were repeated three times each and three IP addresses from France, United Kingdom, and an unknown location were repeated twice. This repetition is important because it highlights a potential opportunity for law enforcement to identify the user over time; a possibility discussed further below.\n\nThe diverse geographic dispersion of the masked IP addresses illustrates a prima facie barrier to tracking down cyber criminals operating on Tor. Extradition complexities may further inhibit the ability to identify, surveil, and arrest illicit users. Furthermore, while IP address repetition may create an opportunity for law enforcement, it is important to recognize that 30% of the IP addresses returned as “unknown” locations. Host relays employing additional security measures such as a second Virtual Privacy Network (VPN) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) cryptographic protocol may provide further protection from surveillance.\n\nThe Bitcoin\n\nThe online anonymity facilitated by masking, routing, or concealing the user IP address is one piece of the online black market. The development of the Bitcoin is also part of the equation. Bitcoin are marketed as a “decentralized digital currency” for a global market. It is a peer-to-peer electronic currency that removes banks and other exchange entities from transactions. However, the anonymity it provides also further protects illicit transactions online. Essentially, instead of using a credit card, debit card, or online payment system like PayPal, which can easily be tracked back to a person, black market virtual industries use Bitcoin, an Internet currency, to anonymously pay for their purchases without a trace. The Bitcoin currency used in an illicit transaction is “tumbled” with the currency of others before and after each transaction, so hypothetically it would be difficult if not impossible to trace the actual Bitcoin back to a particular transaction or user. This automated money laundering process creates an additional barrier for law enforcement and prosecutors. According to Christopher, few digital-currency money laundering “charges have been filed and no cases have yet proceeded through trial to verdict.” Bitcoin prosecution is difficult because digital currency agencies are not necessarily considered financial institutions, and as such, anti-money laundering regulatory schemes and requirements may not apply. More importantly, “serious questions exist regarding whether U.S. courts have jurisdiction for crimes that occur in cyberspace.”\n\nDespite evident barriers, recent developments suggest that law enforcement may be closing in on illicit Bitcoin transactions. For example, shortly after the Department of Homeland Security issued a seizure warrant for the failure to register as a money transmitting business, one of the largest digital currency exchange services, Mt. Gox, collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in February 2014. Although the bankruptcy resulted in a loss of $450 million worth of Bitcoins, which was followed by a value decrease from $1,200 in 2013 to $600 in 2014, financial analysts suggest that the Bitcoin value and use will continue to increase in the future.\n\nThe Virtual Black Market Bazaar\n\nWith the backdrop of anonymous access to the Internet and the ability to conduct untraceable transactions, anything can be bought, sold, and distributed online. Millions of pornographic images and videos of children aged 0-17 can be procured on Tor as easily as a children’s book on Amazon. Terrorists communicate freely, and anyone can purchase guns, C4, explosives, or armor piercing ammunition without a background check. Are you in the market for drugs? Large and small quantities of cocaine, marijuana, ecstasy, and heroin are available, with drug dealer reviews from other users to describe quality and expediency, just as if you were purchasing from a reputable eBay seller. Would you like to buy a human, or perhaps have one killed? You can arrange that as well. These illicit transactions are accessed through Tor on the dark net. The dark net is a peer-to-peer network for exchanging non-commercial goods on encrypted sites, such as .Onion sites.\n\nWhile many of the .Onion sites are shared through peer-to-peer referral, they can also be publicized through Pastebin lists. Many of the websites are oriented toward drug consumerism, such as The Silk Road, Atlantis, and Black Market Reloaded, while a smaller proportion facilitate other illicit activities such as child pornography, arms trafficking, and counterfeiting. Despite operating under the protection of Tor, the .Onion websites often migrate the URL to further stifle surveillance. Recent research suggests that member support and harm reduction ethos of the online illicit marketplaces minimizes actual and consumer perceived risks.\n\nWhile these illicit websites seem to operate without interference from law enforcement, the perception of security is wavering. Most notably, the arrest of Ross Ulbricht and the closure of the largest black market bazaar, Silk Road, in October 2013 caused considerable concern within the Tor community. Ulbricht was tracked by the FBI after he accessed his website using a Virtual Privacy Network (VPN) linked to an e-mail with his actual name instead of TOR. However, following the closure of Silk Road, hundreds of illicit websites opened up to absorb the traffic. The resiliency of the illicit market gave users the impression that these criminal enterprises will continue to flourish on Tor; an impression of impunity that manifested with the quadrupling in value of the Bitcoin post Ulbricht’s arrest.\n\nLaw enforcement entities have made it clear that the Internet is too vast for them to police entirely. While they are aware of the larger illicit websites and making attempts to monitor and track hosts, there are thousands of smaller websites providing illicit services, millions of individual users producing illicit materials, and billions of peer-to-peer transactions that take place concurrently, without garnering attention from authorities. Ultimately, in the race against crime it seems as if two steps taken by illicit syndicates precede every step taken by law enforcement.\n\nFuture Research\n\nIt is important for criminologists, law enforcement agents, practitioners, and the general public to understand that law enforcement innovation is a process of competition and adaptation. When law enforcement practices begin to threaten the survival of criminal enterprises, they will adapt. With each adaptation, there is a learning curve for law enforcement to overcome. Illicit enterprises such as Silk Road had been in operation for several years, but only recently have researchers begun to theorize and test algorithms for corrupting the anonymity provided by secure browsers like Tor. Johnson et. al. use a Tor path simulator (TorPS) to illustrate how the anonymity provided by Tor could be susceptible to threats over time, facilitating the identification of users. Points of entry and exit to the Tor network are identified as weaknesses, which could be exploited. Johnson et. al. found that there was an “80% chance of deanonymization within six months by malicious guard and exit.” Although these simulation methods are likely already utilized by federal agencies in attempt to identify website hosts and possibly track frequent users, at present they can not identify the occasional user or users who employ multiple levels of security in addition to Tor. Furthermore, even if law enforcement does identify a particular user responsible for a large amount of illicit traffic, chances are the responsible party may be based in a foreign country, presenting additional problems regarding jurisdiction and extradition. Future research should further evaluate methods for identifying anonymous users engaged in criminal activity online and extend these tools to international and state level law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn addition to developing methods for compromising the anonymity provided by Tor, researchers are also beginning to develop methods of tracking exchanges with Bitcoin currency, linking transactions to users and illicit purchases. Meiklejohn et. al. apply heuristic clustering methods to group Bitcoin purchases, which could hypothetically be used by agencies with subpoena power to track transactions. While these innovative methods of virtual policing continue to develop, we must recognize that neither hot spot policing, nor virtual policy, nor any other police innovation will reduce the underlying market for drugs, illegal arms, child pornography, terrorism, or human trafficking. They will only improve or hurt our chances of enforcing the law until the next adaptation, and then the cat and mouse game will ensue.\n\nIt is also important to adapt and expand evidence-based concepts to cyber crime, such as Routine Activities Theory and “hot spot” policing. According to Yar, in order to apply routine activities theory to cyber crime, virtual environments must exhibit “spatiotemporal ontology congruent with that of the physical world.” In her application of Routine Activities Theory to cyber crime, Yar recognizes that these crimes do have cyber-spatial relationships, originating in certain virtual places, with geographic concentration in various countries. Additionally, motivated offenders and suitable targets seem homologous between terrestrial and virtual settings. Innovative research in this area has begun to uncover potential patterns to suggest that online surveillance should target cyber crime hot spots. For example, Moeira Moura found that 20 out of 42,201 Internet service providers (ISPs) were responsible for approximately 50% of all spamming IP addresses, most of which were based in Southern Asia. Future research should continue applying these concepts to the dark net and other types of cyber crimes.\n\nAccording to Routine Activities Theory and the growing body of research on “hot spot policing,” capable guardians have the ability to significantly deter motivated offenders. However, although “hot spot policing” significantly reduces crime on the street, current levels of guardianship may fall short in addressing burgeoning criminal enterprises online. Criminologists should consider evaluating this new trend, further explore innovative methods of online surveillance, and test the effects of capable guardianship on the prevention of virtual “street crimes.” Since research and data on the deep web are in their infancy, this essay only provides limited insight into these trending criminal markets. A better understanding of these markets is imperative because the new frontier of policing is online, and the sooner law enforcement adapts, the better.\n\nKimberly Mehlman-Orozco, PhD, is the Executive Director of The Justitia Institute.', 'Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options', 'As interest rates across the world plunge to record lows, some even in the negative territory, savers are left with insignificant or no returns on their bank deposits. Other investment classes such as stocks and real estate are already kissing stratospheric levels, which makes them more risky comparative to the returns intended.\n\nBut, savers need not lose heart, for there is another way to earn great returns, and yes, it is completely legal.\n\nThe digital currency Bitcoin can also be borrowed and lent as loans at rather attractive rates, both for borrowers and lenders.\n\nFor Borrowers\n\nThe complete process of applying for a Bitcoin loan is pretty simple.\n\nJust like in a bank, where to apply for a loan, an account is needed, similarly, while applying for a Bitcoin loan, the borrower has to set up an online account at a website which facilitates Bitcoin loans. Users will then be asked to verify their details before proceeding to the next step.\n\nThe next step requires the borrowers to enter the amount of loan, the time period of the loan, and the interest rate which he is willing to pay on the loan.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin and Dogecoin, are high-risk currencies, and investors with a low-risk appetite may find lending a great way to earn returns.\n\nBut, it must not be forgotten that the borrower might miss out on payments or never pay back. One way to mitigate this risk is by lending only a small number of Bitcoins and doing a background check on the borrower.\n\nBitcoin Loan Websites\n\nCommercial financing backed by Bitcoin and other altcoins has gained a lot of traction in recent times, with websites providing such services mushrooming in conjunction with the expanding Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nSome of the prominent Bitcoin loan websites are:\n\nBTCjam and BitLendingClub provide updated information on the loan listings, which includes amount, interest rate, percentage of amount funded, the remaining time period, expected annual percentage return (APR), ratings (or reputation), and others.\n\nBitbond is another well-renowned name in the Bitcoin loans industry and has catered to over 500 loans with parties from over 120 countries.\n\nA non-commercial player, Kiva also assists in Bitcoin financing to underprivileged communities to help them with the purchase of equipments, higher education, and other basic needs.\n\nFor those who are looking to loan or borrow Bitcoins, the above sites could prove to be immensely helpful.']"
03/20/2015,"['This week\'s news that the UK government will seek to regulate digital currencies made waves in the local startup community.\n\nThe UK Treasury report, revealed on Wednesday as part of chancellor George Osborne\'s annual budget, outlined plans to curb criminal activity via AML (anti-money laundering) regulation and allow digital currency companies to opt-in to standardised consumer protections following May\'s election. The government also proposed injecting £10m into research on digital currencies as part of its larger pledge to innovation in FinTech.\n\nWhile many of the 120 submissions that informed the Treasury\'s plans came from payment bodies, banks, academics, consultancies and fellow government agencies, bitcoin companies also weighed in on the future of digital currency regulation in the UK.\n\nNow that the report and its conclusions are public, are the UK\'s crypto startups happy with the balance that has been struck? We tracked them down to find out.\n\nThe Exchanges\n\nChief among the Treasury report\'s proposals was the introduction of anti-money laundering regulation for digital currency exchanges operating in the UK.\n\nThe exact scope of this regulation (and the regulator enacting it) will be up for debate in the next parliament, but it is likely that exchanges in the UK will have to perform tighter background checks on the digital currency flowing through their books. In turn, customers buying bitcoin may no longer be able to do so anonymously.\n\nMarc Warne, founder of UK bitcoin marketplace Bittylicious, praised the sensibility of the proposals, but questioned regulating crypto-only exchanges at this early stage:\n\n""A light touch approach, such as HMRC\'s general AML policies, make sense for fiat-to-crypto exchanges, and many legitimate businesses in the UK are already implementing such procedures, even if not required. Some AML regulation for digital currency exchanges makes sense to me, but I feel it may be wise to limit this to on and off ramps at this stage rather than crypto-to-crypto exchanges.""\n\nQuickBitcoin co-founder Hugh Halford-Thompson was also impressed by this \'light-touch\'. He, like many others, hopes that the government\'s actions will help bitcoin companies score banking relationships, which have so far proved elusive both in the UK and abroad.\n\n""It\'s good that they see our industry as a nascent one where heavy handed regulation could be detrimental. The government has a real chance here to legitimise the sector. I hope that with this banks will change their tack and stop blacklisting the word \'bitcoin\'.""\n\nNot everyone agrees, however.\n\nRather than legitimising the industry, Akin Fernandez, who runs London\'s bitcoin voucher shop Azteco, said he suspects the Treasury\'s ""artificial restrictions"" will force the UK\'s bitcoin companies to move abroad. He added:\n\n""It’s the opposite of what we asked for. In our submission, we made it plain that arbitrary, irrational regulation is precisely what is not needed. We wanted Britain to be the top destination for bitcoin startups. As far as Azteco is concerned, we can incorporate in any jurisdiction, and will choose the one that is best suited to our business model.""\n\nBitcoin firms already implementing background checks on customers are more welcoming.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, a spokesperson from London-based bitcoin derivatives trading platform, Crypto Facilities, said the company already has ""strict"" KYC and AML procedures in place and is prepared to comply with ""reasonable guidance"" from the government. The company also welcomed what it termed as the UK\'s active and open approach towards digital currencies, adding:\n\n""We think best practice standards would benefit the industry, provided that they do not unduly burden UK-based businesses, reflect the intricacies of digital currencies and are commensurate with the limited resources of many digital currency-related companies and the early stage of the industry as a whole.""\n\nOne of the UK\'s top Local Bitcoins traders, who wished to remain anonymous, said the regulations will probably be workable for his business, which also requires users to present proof of identity. He has made several thousand trades since joining the platform.\n\n""Due to fraud risks the ID we require currently is generally stricter than [traditional] AML requirements so it won\'t be that big a change on the customer side. There will be more admin in making and maintaining records so there will be time and costs to be met. However, the devil is in the detail and we won\'t know that for a few months.""\n\nThe Developers\n\nMuch like New York, which announced that software developers would be exempt from its forthcoming BitLicense, there is no indication that the UK will require digital currency startups to comply with regulation if they do not hold customer funds.\n\nBlockchain, which operates an office in East London, provides a range of bitcoin tools, including a wallet service. Unlike other wallet providers however, its users retain custody of their private keys.\n\nThe company\'s Global Policy Counsel, Marco Santori, praised the line the report has drawn between exchanges and other bitcoin businesses:\n\n""If any digital currency business model creates a risk of money laundering, it\'s the exchange model. HMT (Her Majesty\'s Treasury) did research sufficient to understand this, and has decided to control for it by developing AML requirements. This is in welcome contrast to the blunderbuss approaches we\'ve seen in other jurisdictions.""\n\nHe added that the Treasury\'s proposals are likely to put consumers first:\n\n""As to consumer protection, HMT has rightly focused on custodians, and the resulting framework will likely be opt-in. This approach respects consumers\' right to choose the custodian of their funds, which Blockchain supports. Though Blockchain, as a non-custodian, will likely not be directly included in this framework, the company sees it as a step in the right direction, and an opportunity to further develop a consumer-friendly regulatory landscape.""\n\nJonathan James Harrison, formerly of ATM startup Satoshipoint, started a new software venture, Telebit, last month. The service, which operates on Telegram, lets the messaging app\'s 50 million monthly users send bitcoin to each other without the need to register. Unlike Blockchain, Telebit does store users\' funds in a centralised company wallet.\n\nHarrison said:\n\n""This report shows the UK government is supporting digital currencies and the innovation they bring, which is very positive news. For us at Telebit, we operate in a crypto-only environment and will not be subject to these new AML regulations.""\n\nHe added that the report comes as welcome news to bootstrapped startups who may be unable to afford legal advice and compliance officers.\n\nThe Storage Providers\n\nWhile respondents to the Treasury\'s Call for Information were fairly united on the need for crime prevention, they were more divided on the subject of consumer protection. Just under half didn\'t think the government should regulate on the subject, while others advocated to adapt existing FCA frameworks for consumers.\n\nThe government\'s conclusion fell somewhere between the two camps, advocating for a set of voluntary industry standards developed in consultation with the BSI (British Standards Institution) and the bitcoin community, something championed by industry group UKDCA.\n\nIndeed, bitcoin custodians – companies who hold funds on behalf of customers – have been moving towards standardised practices for some time. Multi-sig wallet provider BitGo recently joined with C4 to create a draft Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS), while UK bitcoin vault Elliptic has taken steps to audit and insure its operations.\n\nElliptic\'s COO Tom Robinson said the Treasury\'s conclusions mirrored the recommendations put forward by the company:\n\n""It is positive that the industry is being left to develop its own technical standards (led by the UKDCA) – self regulation will promote innovation much more effectively than onerous regulation. These measures will help to make the UK a global hub for digital currencies and maintain its position at the forefront of FinTech innovation.""\n\nOne of the best-funded startups in the space, Circle, which operates out of Boston and Dublin, also offers a bank-like service for bitcoin users, with an emphasis on insurance and security.\n\nChief Compliance Officer John Beccia praised the report for its ""proactive"" stance, which he said doesn\'t overburden businesses:\n\n""We appreciate that the report recognises the benefits of digital currency and acknowledge that the report appropriately identifies key areas of risk, such as money laundering and consumer protection concerns. We are encouraged that the UK regulators are focused on developing balanced regulations that not only mitigate these risks, but also do not place burdens on legitimate businesses.""\n\nAdam Cleary, the founder of Bullion Bitcoin, a storage provider and gold-bitcoin exchange, also echoed this sentiment:\n\n""We are very pleased by the government\'s response. By providing regulatory clarity and legitimacy to digital currencies and related startup businesses, specifically around anti-money laundering requirements, the UK is reaffirming its position at the forefront of digital currency innovation. In particular we welcome the news that the FCA\'s Project Innovate will work with HM Treasury and the Prudential Regulatory Authority to explore a regulatory \'sandbox\' to allow innovative start-up companies to test ideas at an early stage without excessive regulation.""\n\nThe specifics of the Treasury\'s plans will undergo a consultation process in the next government. Whether the UK will succeed in its ambition to create a world-leading bitcoin hub will become clearer in time. For now, the nation\'s bitcoin ecosystem remains positive.\n\nWhat are your reactions to the Treasury report?

The global monetary system is in a runaway inflation; investors have always considered gold as an escape from inflation and a last resort against governments that have the power to divert funds from individual accounts and central banks with the capacity of printing money and unleash devaluation politics. Gold often benefits when exposed to inflationary environments because it is still one of the best ways to preserve the value and one of the best methods of escaping government control. Bitcoin is very similar to gold; it’s scarce, it can be used as a mean of exchange and it also works outside of the government control.\n\nGold has been used as medium of exchange throughout history; however, its inherent characteristics make it quite inefficient as a payment method. Gold is difficult to store or carry and is also very inappropriate for small transactions. On the other hand, Bitcoin is extremely simple to store, easy to carry and also an excellent store of value working as an asset outside of the banking system and government control.\n\nOne aspect that outlays bitcoin is that is a fairly new currency with limited acceptability, but its huge impact made it the fastest-growing medium of exchange to date.\n\nJudging from the current panorama and within a cautious approach, I would say that gold still comes out as a winner as a long-term investment because of its real intrinsic value, it’s a tangible asset with a stable price, and because people will always accept gold. And we have the history that proves it. All in all, bitcoin also can be considered as a winner on the speculative side of investment simply because its volatility offers speculators far more profitable trading chances than any other asset.\n\nAlso, if bitcoin succeeds as a currency it will turn out to be the best option for long term investment. Bitcoin’s acceptance has been growing by the minute. Big companies are having a sudden interest in the potential of this technology and the amazing capabilities of the Blockchain. Let’s hope this can help bitcoin succeed as a currency as well.\n\nLink to Source\n\nImage source: 1, 2', 'Bitcoin tipping service ChangeTip has integrated with video streaming platform Twitch.tv.\n\nThe integration works by way of a ChangeTip tip bot, which Twitch.tv streamers can authorize to join their chat channels.

Drop shipping companies, which simply takes customer orders in and lets manufacturers and wholesalers take care of the actual transfer of goods, are also opening up to the idea of accepting bitcoin payments.\n\nThese companies can offer anything and everything – from fashion items to gadgets – as drop shippers typically have a low cost outlay and focus mainly on marketing the products. Other overhead costs, such as storage and shipping fees are shouldered by the wholesaler. Drop shipping businesses generally profit from the difference between wholesale and retail prices.\n\nDrop Shipping Companies and Bitcoin\n\nWith the value of a bitcoin not tied to a particular asset or managed by a central bank, lower transactions fees are also associated with accepting bitcoin payments. This perhaps is the feature that most online companies are drawn to, as this means lower overhead costs compared to accepting payments in debit or credit cards.\n\nDrop shipping companies generally make use of a third-party service to facilitate bitcoin payments, such as Bitpay Gateway. These companies generally convert the bitcoin amount to cash for the merchant or the customer.\n\nFor instance, Australia-based Shop with Bits offers different types of online payment options, namely PayPal, BitPay, and POLi internet banking. Another example is BitcoinCommodities.com, which sells gold bars or silver coins that are drop shipped in exchange for bitcoin payments.\n\nThe unique feature of the bitcoin is its blockchain, which serves as a ledger of transactions for that particular unit. Anonymity and security are generally associated with this feature, as the latest transaction is updated to the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nLarger drop shipping companies have yet to integrate this mode of payment as part of their usual transaction options.', 'Mainstream banks and financial institutions are warming up to Bitcoin and digital blockchain-based fintech, often with a surprisingly positive and open-minded attitude.\n\nIn a recent research paper titled “One Bank Research Agenda,” the Bank of England said that Bitcoin could reshape the financial industry and called for further research to devise a system that could use distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank’s ability to control its currency.\n\nA recent Goldman Sachs report titled “The Future of Finance: Redefining the Way We Pay in the Next Decade” states that Bitcoin is a megatrend that could shape the future of finance. “Innovations in network technology and cryptography could change the speed and mechanics of moving money,” the report says.\n\nA Wall Street Bitcoin Alliance has formed to cater for the growing interest in digital fintech shown by Wall Street operators, and innovative financial institutions such as German Fidor Bank are openly embracing Bitcoin as part of their operations.\n\nCredit Suisse, the large Switzerland-based multinational financial services holding company that operates the Credit Suisse Bank and other financial services investments, has published an article titled “Bitcoins – Money Without Physical Form.” The article takes a lukewarm position on Bitcoin, which, according to the company, should be combined with the traditional financial system.\n\nAfter providing a short and simplified introduction to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the article analyzes the advantages and shortcomings of Bitcoin as both a security and a currency. The low transaction costs and easy transfer around the globe indicate that Bitcoin should be considered a legitimate currency, as does the fact that many online providers accept bitcoin. The Credit Suisse analyst wonders whether Bitcoin has the potential to become commonplace and to dislodge the money monopoly from the central banks.\n\nBut the author thinks the advantage of Bitcoin over traditional currencies – decentralization – is also its biggest drawback, because there is no authority that guarantees the value of the currency.\n\n“A currency is only worth what you believe you will be able to purchase with it tomorrow,” notes the analyst, who considers the huge fluctuations in the exchange value of bitcoin a result of the absence of a central bank able to stabilize the currency and provide confidence.\n\n“If this confidence is removed, the value of the currency can decline rapidly, which is what happened with bitcoins at the beginning of 2014. The opposite is also harmful: The increase in value bitcoins experienced in 2013 would have corresponded to an economically crippling deflation if they had been the general means of payment. These fluctuations in value are what is stopping bitcoins from becoming more widespread as a means of payment.”\n\nThese considerations seem to point to the desirability of new implementations of digital currencies controlled by governments and central banks, similar to the FedCoin proposal by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the digital currency framework that IBM is rumored to be developing for use by central authorities.\n\nSuch a centrally controlled cryptocurrency would combine the advantages of Bitcoin – cheaper and faster transactions, permanently recorded in a tamper-proof ledger – with the value stabilization and user monitoring that a central bank can provide.\n\n“Who do you trust more, your own central bank or an anonymous online network?” asks the author.\n\n“Nevertheless, bitcoins have a future in certain areas and countries,” states the Credit Suisse article. “When combined with the traditional financial system, bitcoins could have cost advantages over credit cards or providers such as Western Union when used as a transaction system.”\n\nEchoing opinions expressed by Finance Minister of Greece Yanis Varoufakis, the article concludes that “In countries such as Argentina and Zimbabwe, where confidence in the country’s own currency retaining its value is very low, bitcoins are an alternative that is being used with increasing success.”', 'Why South Korea just might be perfect ground for the global Bitcoin economy to take root.\n\nSouth Korea’s development during the last half century has been nothing short of spectacular. The country is known for its home grown, highly visual K-pop, which is popular with millions around the globe. Ranked first by the Bloomberg’s Global Innovation Index in 2014, South Korea is also the home of business empires such as Samsung and LG, whose brands are recognized and popular all over the world. When it comes to technology, the country has a lot more to offer than just these two companies – there is a growing amount of startup activity that is showing more and more potential.\n\nIn Korea, many people, both young and old, use the latest smartphones and tablets with NFC and camera technology. Wifi and cellular data is reliable and widely accessible. Common barriers to countries adopting bitcoin – such as market penetration of new technologies and smartphone usage – are lower in Korea, making this a promising place for bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nBitcoin boom\n\nBitcoin, one of the most innovative technologies of the last decade, has also significantly influenced many young and motivated entrepreneurs with startup companies popping up more and more frequently in the past year. Many investments and fund raising by local and international venture capitalists have given Bitcoin a foothold in South Korea. Last year Coinplug, one the biggest exchange and wallet services in the country, had a funding deal worth US$2.5m USD while its biggest competitor, Korbit netted US$3m in series A funding.\n\nExchanges such as Coinplug, Korbit, Xcoin, Coinone, and Coinpia are operating and competing with transaction fees that are close or equal to zero. But since these exchange platforms are operating with nearly zero fees, it is hard to use their data from any statistical purposes to illustrate bitcoin adoption in Korea. Nonetheless, this competition has motivated these companies to innovate and offer more and better services to their customers.\n\nFor instance, Coinplug made bitcoin more accessible by providing 2-way ATMs and is selling bitcoins at 24,000 7-Eleven convenience stores. On top of that, they recently unveiled their collaboration with Nautilus Hyosung – one of the largest ATM manufacturers in Asia – making bitcoin purchasable at 7000 ATMs across the country.\n\nApart from the bitcoin startup scene and businesses, Korea also has one of the most active Bitcoin communities in Asia. Its largest meetup group, Seoul Bitcoin, welcomes both locals and expats by hosting meetups twice a week with the purpose of educating those who are new to bitcoin and bringing together existing enthusiasts. Seoul Bitcoin recently celebrated its one-year anniversary, where it announced that it has grown to over 400 members in record time. A recent analysis of bitcoin meetups worldwide revealed that the Seoul based community is one of the fastest growing meetups of 2015.\n\nWhen asked about their success, Ruben Somsen – founder and organizer of Seoul Bitcoin – told CoinTelegraph\n\n“I believe the key to our growth lies in allowing everyone in the community to contribute. Bitcoin seems to attract some amazingly intelligent and open minded people, and they all want bitcoin to succeed, so it just makes sense to work together.”\n\nRecently in the heart of Seoul, the Bitcoin Center Korea opened its doors. The Center is a bitcoin information center, a community center for meetups, and a co-working space. They’re open daily to the public and welcome anyone interested in bitcoin. The focus of the Center will be on education, as it aims to provide daily tutorials and workshops on various Bitcoin-related topics.\n\nSeoul was also the host to the Inside Bitcoin conference last December and it will be hosting the conference again this December.\n\nBitcoin is not fully regulated in Korea as of this date, but the country appears to be open and ready to embrace this amazing new technology. With the great potential of this high-tech country and its active bitcoin community, we should start seeing Korea and Bitcoin more often in the near future.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The Department made a clear effort to improve the BitLicense from its original 2014 proposal to regulate digital currency, such as Bitcoin. However, the new draft still contains problems CDT and others had pointed out in the original proposal. As written, the Department’s new “BitRegs” still undermines the privacy of digital currency users and covers an unnecessarily broad range of services.\n\n[Check out CDT’s blog post and our joint comments with Coin Center and TechFreedom to the original BitLicense draft.]\n\nDigital currency is a fledgling technology with disruptive potential that can enhance the privacy and ease of financial transactions. Because New York is a global financial hub, the digital currency standards that the Department enacts can have a significant impact on the future of this innovation and users’ privacy interests. Other jurisdictions will issue their own digital currency regulations, and the precedent that New York sets will be closely scrutinized – so it’s important to craft nuanced and forward-looking rules.\n\nImprovements Made\n\nThe Department made several positive changes from its original BitLicense proposal and deserves credit for listening to comments.\n\nOne of the most important improvements is that the new draft regulations make clear that merely developing and disseminating software by itself does not require a BitLicense. We urged the Department to avoid applying the BitLicense’s heavy record-keeping requirements to software developers that create digital currency applications but that do not have any ongoing relationship users – such as a small developer that makes a digital currency wallet application available freely on the Internet.\n\nThe new BitLicense draft also removed the requirement that any businesses which “secured” digital currency would be required to get a license. We pointed out that such a change was necessary to avoid needless inclusion of cybersecurity vendors and contractors.\n\nAnother improvement is an explicit carve-out for non-financial uses of digital currency protocols, such as using nominal sums of BitCoins to memorialize non-financial transactions on the block chain.\n\nRemaining Problems\n\nHere are three big remaining issues with the BitLicense, and our recommendations for addressing them.\n\n1) Counterparty Identification\n\nOne of the most severe problems we raised with the original BitLicense was its blanket requirement that license-holders collect, maintain, and share the identities and physical addresses of every party and counterparty to every virtual currency transaction. (The counterparty is the party who is not the user of the service, such as the merchant who receives the funds of a digital currency user.) This requirement would be highly damaging to user privacy and undermine innovative digital currency applications. The Department’s new draft makes an improvement in this area, which is appreciated, but it is unclear that the improvement will be effective.\n\nThe new BitLicense proposal would require digital currency services to identify every counterparty to every transaction “to the extent practicable.” As drafted, this requirement gives businesses unclear guidance, may undermine the pseudonymous appeal of digital currencies like BitCoin, and may dissuade consumers from using digital currency to complete embarrassing but legitimate transactions. Requiring identification of the parties to each transaction can also create security liabilities for digital currency services, which must collect and secure the data for – as the BitLicense would require – “at least seven years.”\n\nIt is unclear how the BitLicense’s “to the extent practicable” standard would be implemented and under what circumstances the requirement would be waived for not being practicable. For example, if vendors developed commercially available software capable of fulfilling the requirement, would it become “practicable” – and therefore required under the Department’s regulations – for all digital currency businesses to fulfill the counterparty identification requirement because they can purchase the software? What if a digital currency service is technically capable of performing counterparty identification, but doing so would undermine a core feature of the service – such as strong user privacy controls?\n\nThe new BitLicense draft, like the original proposal, seems to place a new administrative burden on digital currency businesses. The new BitLicense proposal would go beyond recordkeeping requirements for money services businesses under Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) “travel rule” on transmittal of funds. FinCEN public guidance states that information about transaction counterparties must only be recorded when received.\n\nAs with the original BitLicense draft, CDT recommends aligning digital currency regulations with existing FinCEN rules – requiring the identification of counterparties only if received with the transaction order. Alternatively, the Department could issue public guidance interpreting “practicable” in this context to mean that BitLicense-holders should collect counterparty identifications if that information is received in transactions. If that is not possible, then limiting the counterparty identification requirements only to high-value, high-risk, or high-volume transactions would be more appropriate than the BitLicense requirement as it is currently written.\n\n2) Ban on identity obfuscation\n\nThe new BitLicense draft would continue to require that digital currency businesses collect the identities and physical addresses of each of their users, and forbids BitLicense-holders from allowing any transfer or transaction that would “obfuscate or conceal” the identity of a user or counterparty. This requirement implies that service providers must monitor their users’ transactions to prevent obfuscation, and at times, prevent users from spending their own digital currency.\n\nAs we pointed out in joint comments, digital currencies – including Bitcoin – record transactions on a public ledger, the “block chain.” The records show a pseudonymous public address and transaction information, which can be traced back to the individual user. An individual’s financial and transaction histories are sensitive data, especially if the individual uses digital currency for many micropayments throughout the course of a normal day, so it is understandable that some individuals may wish to avoid creating public records of some transactions. Some digital currency innovations provide a means to scramble transaction records as they appear on the public block chain, though such a service may not necessarily scramble the non-public records of the BitLicense-holders of which the user is a customer. Yet the BitLicense appears to forbid the use of such scrambling services.\n\nAs with the original BitLicense draft, CDT recommends the Department revise the BitLicense to allow for identity obfuscation on the block chain, so long as digital currency services remain in compliance with BitLicense recordkeeping requirements. That way, users could still scramble their transactions as they appear on the block chain without scrambling the internal records of the BitLicense-holder.\n\n3) Gaming currencies\n\nThe original BitLicense proposal would have created an exemption from BitLicense requirements for digital currency used solely in video gaming platforms with no market or application outside of the game. Yet the digital currencies for many popular online games have (usually unauthorized) markets and exchanges that sell or exchange the gaming currency for fiat money and other gaming currency. As a result, video game vendors – as digital currency issuers and administrators – may be needlessly subject to BitLicense requirements. This may seem like a small or novel problem, but the BitLicense risks creating legal uncertainty and privacy problems for numerous large companies with many millions of users.\n\nThe new BitLicense proposal takes a step to correct this problem, but does not completely solve it. The original draft would exempt gaming currencies with no market or application outside of the gaming platform, and the new draft would also exempt gaming currencies that can be redeemed for real-world goods and services. However, the new draft would include gaming currency that can be converted to fiat currency or other digital currency, as well as gaming currency with marketplaces outside the game.\n\nThe new BitLicense draft would appear to apply recordkeeping requirements to gaming vendors if the game’s users – even without the authorization of the vendors – set up a marketplace around the currency external to the game. As we noted in our joint comments, many external marketplaces exist where users can purchase or trade fiat currency for gaming currency or other digital currency. Two examples are marketplaces trading dollars or euros for Eve Online’s Interstellar Kredit, and trading Second Life Linden Dollars for Bitcoin.\n\nAs with the original BitLicense draft, CDT recommends limiting the BitLicense gaming currency requirements only to gaming currencies with external marketplaces authorized by the game vendor or operator. It would be better still to limit BitLicense requirements to the external marketplace itself, rather than the administrator or issuer of the digital currency – that way, only users engaged in the marketplace would be subject to the BitLicense recordkeeping requirements, not every user of the game.\n\nHopefully Further Refinement Ahead\n\nThe Department clearly considered many of the requests made by the digital currency community, and the notable improvements on the previous draft are welcome. We urge the Department to refine the BitLicense further to provide clarity to digital currency businesses and protect user privacy.', 'SFARDS announced they have taped out their 28nm ASIC that will allow miners to mine both SHA-256/Bitcoin and Scrypt coins like Litecoin. The power to gigahash ratio is aggressive according to their press release. They are also shooting for an April release of they miners to both large operations and small miners.\n\nSFARDS is a Chinese cryptocurrency mining company, created from the merger between Gridseed and WiiBox. The Gridseed line of miners was very popular starting with the Gridseed 5 chip Orbs then the larger 5.2 mh/s Blades. They even jumped up to larger sizes like the Gridseed Black a 23 mh/s unit that drew roughly 450 watts before fading out on the mining scene.\n\nAlso Read: Sfards – WiiBox, Diginforce, and Gridseed Join Forces for New Bitcoin ASIC Manufacturer\n\nThe news that they had been reborn as SFARDS when they merged with WiiBox was met with at first skepticism and then anticipation in some sectors. There have been so many scams like KnC and Butterfly Labs that the low profile launch of their miners seems to have found the sweet spot. They also boast a solid backing and clear goals for their steps into the industry.\n\nWe are funded by the angel investor Li Xiao Lai. In addition to this, we have financial backing from the tier-\xad?one international VC firm Matrix Partners. SFARDS’ primary focus and experience lies in ASIC Research, Miner Development, Data Center Management, and Cloud Services.\n\nAggressive Chip Specifications\n\nThe SF3301 will be the next generation of dual?algorithm mining chips, the world’s first 28nm with the capability to mine SHA?256 and Scrypt Simultaneously. The advantages of this ability translate to an extended period of effectiveness for the miner and increased profitability. By using FDSOI technology not currently present in any other chip on the market, power efficiency when mining with SHA?256 is predicted to reach below the 0.3 J/GH range, and 2.0 J/MH when mining with Scrypt.\n\nIf the boards they go on are optimized well and the chips perform to spec they should be a great addition to the Bitcoin and Scrypt ASIC industry. The density of gh/s and mh/s we should see in one package is going to be interesting. The global hash rate for both Bitcoin and many Scrypt coins like Litecoin is higher than it was when Gridseed first came on the market. For the miners to be competitive the density will have to be much higher than before. The new company that is SFARDS will debut their new miners in the coming couple months if all goes to plan. WiiBox being part of the company also allows for them to make even more optimizations at the controller level.\n\nJack Niederer, International Project Development Manager at SFARDS had this to say on the tape out process:\n\nWe are pleased to announce the completion of the tapeout of our new dual-algorithm ASIC and look forward to the announcement of our debut product soon. We feel that dual-algorithm technology at this level will be a refreshing step towards a longer shelf-life for hardware and increased adaptability to price fluctuations.\n\nThings have been slow lately in the ASIC part of the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency industry as many companies are between generations or have just announced their new chips like BitFury. The opportunity is there for SFARDS to make an impact on the transaction processing industry. We will keep you up to date as we get more information and hands-on with SFARDS new ASICs.\n\nWhat do you think about SFARDS’ move into the Bitcoin and Scrypt coin mining industry?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Earlier this year, the leading Bitcoin Crypto Exchange and Cloud Mining service provider Cex.io had suspended Bitcoin cloud mining services citing a drastic plunge in the cryptocurrency’s price and an increase in network difficulty.\n\n“Mining with using User’s Gigahashes can be stopped by CEX.IO if the amount of the Maintenance Cost exceeds rewards for each mined block or if the mining is economically inexpedient.”\n\nOther cloud mining companies are also feeling the pinch of the falling price of Bitcoin. Founded in 2013, CloudHashing has put its ambitious expansion plans on hold in the wake of the digital currency devaluing against the dollar. Ravi Iyengar, CEO of Cointerra sums it all up when he says that,\n\n“Pretty much all the mining companies are struggling. The mining industry is somewhere no one would have predicted six months ago. The model we all relied upon has collapsed.”\n\nBut even in these extremely competitive times, there are some companies willing to stand tall. They expect the smaller players to bail out en masse and increase their market share to profit immensely when the tide is in their favor.\n\nBitcoin Cloud Services – While other companies were busy contemplating ways to cut down on their expenses, Bitcoin Cloud Services rewarded its customers with lucrative discounts for a week. The company announced the “1st Year Anniversary Discounts” this month.\n\nCloudHashing – Even though the most trusted cloud mining company is taking a step back in increasing its market presence, it has no plans to shut down its shop. The company’s website is still offering hashing power to those interested in mining the cryptocurrency.\n\nHashop.io – Comparatively a small player in the Bitcoin cloud mining business, Hashop is still welcoming customers who wish to become miners.\n\nOther mentionable names in the industry are Genesis Mining and ZEUSHASH.com.\n\nWhat if Bitcoin price continues to fall?\n\nIf Bitcoin price continues to fall or fails to advance in the coming months, an increased number of cloud mining businesses will take a hard beating. The profit margins have already become insignificant and ceased to exist for many in the industry.\n\nA report in January revealed that roughly 30,000 miners have given up on mining the cryptocurrency, but it could also be because at around the same time, Cex.io had suspended its operations.\n\nHarvard Associate Professor Benjamin Edelman had earlier said that, “Miners are pulling out and dumping Bitcoin to make up for lost revenue, which itself changes the value. Those that do continue mining will contribute to the problem because they will have to immediately sell any Bitcoins they mine.”\n\nSo, are there solutions to this acute problem? Well, they are conditional at best. One is to provide these services when the electricity costs are extremely low, as it eats away a major portion of profits. But there are no clues as to when is that happening. Second is to put the operations on hold until Bitcoin recoups the losses; this is what is actually happening in crude oil sector as well.\n\nThe Bitcoin industry needs a surge in price for its survival. And I cannot stress it enough that the sooner it happens, the better!', 'Bitcoin peer-to-peer lending network BTCJam has implemented a risk-based pricing model, changing the way it sets borrowing interest rates in an attempt to improve users\' security.\n\nThe model, widely used by lenders in the mortgage and financial services industries, sets the borrower\'s interest rate based upon their credit score; the higher the credit score, the lower the interest rate.\n\nA statement from the lending network, said:\n\n""Since BTCJam has all of the information about the borrowers, we are in a better position to determine the likelihood of the borrower paying back the loan and will adjust the interest rate accordingly.""\n\n""We are confident that this change will improve BTCJam and allow us to continue to maintain the highest repayment rates in peer-to-peer lending, as well as increase overall returns to investors,"" the statement concluded.\n\nThe new model means interest rates for all loans will be standardised, ensuring that investors are able to offset possible loans from defaults.\n\nLoans created prior to the adoption of the risk-based pricing model will continue until they have either been funded or have expired.']"
03/21/2015,"['I’ll trust that you as the reader are educated enough to know the U.S. Dollar is on it’s last legs as the Global Reserve Currency. I’ve certainly written about the shaky financial situation of the U.S. enough, and there is no shortage of information online about the subject. The U.S. Government has started selling MRAPs to every backwoods county in the U.S. for pennies on the dollar, just because. They know what’s going on, and when the Dollar falls, the stuff will definitely hit the fan nationwide, and those machines will be used.\n\nThe Police State is being bred to be bigger, stronger, and more authoritarian. Unethical, immoral laws are being written and passed under the cover of hundreds of pages of legalese to take citizen’s rights and reverse the covenant the once great nation aspired to live up to. If you don’t see what’s happening, it’s on you, at this point. The future is not being hidden from you. 90% of the puzzle has been completed. If you don’t know, its only because you really just don’t want to know.\n\nPolicy, hubris, and ambition are changing everything\n\nEastern Superpowers China and Russia are Burning The Midnight Oil to accelerate the U.S. Dollar’s demise. Not that American economic policy and hubris isn’t the main factor in it. The smart eastern leadership have had enough of this economic tyranny and are moving to not only end it, but take advantage of it. Massive purchases in Gold bullion and natural resources, bilateral trade agreements, and new economic partnerships that 5-10 years ago would’ve been unthinkable, and new financial infrastructures are now a daily occurrence.\n\nThe latest nail in the Dollar’s coffin is China’s successfully realease of the Asian International Investment Bank (AIIB) to help fund international infrastructure projects. Besides being another Chinese-backed international banking power, following their BRICS Development Bank initiative of last year, it has also attracted longtime American-“BFF” Great Britain as a founding member, along with over 20 other countries. Italy, Germany, France, and other heavyweights stand with China’s AIIB venture, and take a step back from the U.S.-run IMF/World Bank monopoly. It’s a wise move to strengthen financial relationships with a country many are already doing bilateral trades with. It’s also evidence that few want to be left holding the U.S. Dollar’s bag when the global power officially shifts, so it’s a good time to score brownie points with the next global economic leader. This was also despite pressures from the U.S. to avoid partaking in this alliance. Suffice to say the U.S. was not invited to this global block party. Oooh, burn!\n\nThe only questions remaining are when does this Dollar collapse take effect, and what comes next as the world’s proceeding mediums of economic exchange. Critics, or what the kids today would call “haters,” have wished Bitcoin into the graveyard for years. Yet, the combination of market demand, superior protocol engineering, growing venture capital, impressive corporate votes of confidence, and “The Network Effect” have led Bitcoin to be somewhat unstoppable as an independent, non-centralized currency. Think of it as a snowball at the top of a mountain. You can barely see it from the valley, but in due time, that avalanche is coming. Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere, in fact, it will only adapt and come faster as more venture capital, app builders, programmers and users come on board.\n\nGold has been the de facto economic standard since Adam met Eve. It’s as old as the hills, and to many just as valuable. Economic indexes are commonly built on a value relative to gold, and, of course, the U.S. Dollar last had real intrinsic value in 1971 when you could still trade dollars for Gold.\n\nThat’s not just the U.S. Dollar, but the entire world has gone the tragic route of a global fiat currency, the economic prognosis is not good. No. We live in a global economy, and the more your economy depends of a fiat-based currency, the more it will suffer once all this fiat nonsense sorts itself out. Base currency amounts (the amount of circulating paper currency in an economy) is booming in nations worldwide. It’s not just an American phenomenon. Every government is debasing their currency because the fiat currency, Keynesian economic model is a total failure. Printing more money to buy their way out of a self-inflicted economic prison. Strangely, every country plays the same game, and they’re playing it to lose.\n\nFor you and I., this is not good since the economic aftereffects will be almost nuclear. Every nation will suffer significant economic damage in the not-too-distant future. Tax increases on citizens (“Obamacare” brought over twenty different tax increases alone) is a sign of economic desperation. And you can go back to the infamous Gold Confiscation Act of 1933 for more proof. The country was in the middle of The Great Recession, and when a government has to take all the Gold from their citizenry to function, it’s a sign of desperation, not inspiration.\n\nHere, let’s review what money is, and how money is looking to change in the future. Granted, the Chinese Yuan, or some gold-backed currency, will replace the U.S. Dollar as the world’s currency soon enough. What will this mean for those who won’t be using the Yuan on a daily basis? What will The West do with whatever is left of their wealth after the Dollar’s day in the sun is finally over? How do alternatives like Gold and Bitcoin compare? Which should you have? Gold or Bitcoin? Let’s review what we know.\n\nGold or Bitcoin? Decisions… decisions…\n\nChina and Russia aren’t buying Gold every chance they get because it’s not valuable enough now. It may be the engine that powers the world’s economies for the rest of the 21st century, but what does that mean to us, the common man? Gold may power governments, but when is the last time you bought a week’s worth of groceries with Gold? A man’s gotta eat, no? We are talking about physical Gold, not any writs, proxies, shares, or representations thereof.\n\nLet’s take for granted that Gold is the most valuable substance in the world, just based on cache and global acceptance alone. People love it; governments love it. If you travel at all, you’ll notice that the local coinage in any country in the world either resembles gold, silver or a combination of the two. These precious metals represent value to all societies, and that has been ingrained in all of us. We have been conditioned, like dogs, to believe in these substances as being of high value. And it is true. Gold will become much, much more valuable ten years from now than it is today. Can you take advantage of that? Would you know how to buy gold bullion? Would you know a fake Gold coin from “The Real McCoy”?\n\nThe news has had no problem pointing out the foibles of Bitcoin, and the last year has been a year of some serious teething and growing pains, as the Bitcoin market matures. Is Gold that much better? If you look back over the last five years, Gold has seen plenty of market volatility, even more so than Bitcoin. Bitcoin had the Mt. Gox/China/”Willy Bot” price explosion in Q4 of 2013, and 2014 was spent doing market correction. In five years, that’s not that bad for a brand new global currency. One major economic bubble and market correction. And when all the dust settled, Bitcoin was still worth more than twice what it was before this all started sixteen months ago (nobody in mainstream media likes to bring that up.)\n\nGold, on the other hand, has seen many more peaks and drops in this decade than Bitcoin has. Gold has gone from anywhere between $1900 USD to $1100 in price and has been dropping steadily for over two years, and the scuttlebutt now is will Gold fall below $1000 USD? Is the media banging the drum on that? Most of you have heard that before. Gold has dropped a couple of hundred dollars in a month several times. It is widely held by investors, economists, and market insiders that the Gold and Comex markets are largely controlled by “The banksters”, your JP Morgan’s and Goldman Sachs of the world.\n\nHow many times have you heard over the past 2-3 years to “Buy Gold”? So why is the price down 40% since 2012? A clear sign of market manipulation on Wall Street (The hell you say!). It is also widely held that the “real value” of Gold is many times it’s current traded price. The point is Gold has not proven to be a model of economic stability. If anything it is quite the opposite, but in these very uncertain economic times, no commodity is going to be ultra-stable or free from rampant speculation or market manipulation. There are a lot of hands in this cookie jar, suffice to say.\n\nSo let’s assume Gold is a great investment at a “Buy” price because it is severely undervalued at market rates. How does this help you? If you wanted to go and buy some gold, just how savvy would you need to be? The media loves to talk about Bitcoin scams and Bitcoin exchanges going under, and that’s all true. How many Gold scams are there? How many Gold coins have been sold on TV that turned out to be totally fake and worthless? Would you fall for the current scams of the EFT or the “Gold Certificate” going on right now? When the global fiat economy breaks down, do you really think anyone is going to honor a “Gold certificate”? You really think a broker, who himself has little or no gold, is going to make get your physical gold and hand it over to you? When an ounce is worth $10k? If you did get something physical, what are the chances it is the purity of Gold that you thought you bought? Could you tell?\n\nLet’s say you are the savviest new Gold investor in the world. Let’s say you did all your online research and met a guy who knew a friend what has a broker who has a vault with the purest Gold Bullion you ever saw. And he’d sell it to you for market price, and you wouldn’t get some worthless IOU, but you could buy a couple of pounds of pure Gold. Now you have 32 Gold coins. Now, what?\n\nAlso read: Vaultoro Opens Swiss Gold Vaults to Bitcoiners\n\nIt’s five years later, and you have no job, dollars are worthless, and all you have are these 32 coins which are worth a fortune. What can you do with them? You need food. Are you trading one coin worth thousands of dollars for food for the next week? These coins are not divisible, not widely accepted as cash value. Can you buy gas, electricity, oil? How would you go about it? Are you safe with these super valuable coins? Word won’t get out that you have these coins? Walking around with them is like walking around with a million dollars in a briefcase today. You think the Police State is going to let you travel out of the country with this Gold on you? Really? And who says there won’t be more Gold confiscation going forward? Some say it’s secretly happening right now, as we speak. If that card were played before, it could be played again. The reasons are immaterial. The result is the same. It’s a transfer of wealth from you to the banks. With a stroke of a pen, that can become the law of your land.\n\nWhat’s my point? That Gold is a bad investment? No. The point is unless you are a central bank; Gold is terrible as money. It is not built to be a global currency at the present time. It is not very divisible in practical terms. It is volatile in price. It is not safe to move as a physical asset, and is not widely accepted in the real world. It is more of a liability than an asset, as a form of currency. Great investment, but not great as money.\n\nNow let’s look at Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has a lot of downsides to it. You can’t hold it, so you are trained, like a dog, or like Warren Buffet, to think it is not real. Or that it has no value because you cannot see it or hold it in your hands. Aren’t the moist valuable things in life free, intangible, or without physical properties? Love, willpower, faith, health, innovative ideas that have shaped the future of man, like The Internet? Bitcoin enters the stage here.\n\nIt is not easily obtained in any real quantity, but this it shares with Gold in that it is precious and is not available on every street corner, like a fiat currency. What it does not share with Gold is that it is highly, highly divisible, down to the Satoshi (a millionth of a Bitcoin or BTC). As far as security, Bitcoins are as secure as you make them. If you use fairly basic multi-sig security methods, you’ll grow old with your Bitcoins. A thief in the street would never know if you have no bitcoins or one thousand. An online hacker may need to not just beat your security measures, but another person may have to sign onto a new transaction. How will he beat that?\n\nIt can be moved anywhere in the world with just your mind. Set up a brain wallet, and a nasty Gestapo agent won’t be any the wiser of your intrepid wealth in the digital realm, as you enjoy what’s left of your freedom abroad. Try sending your bitcoin to a remote location in an Indonesian forest, which would take seconds, then try the same thing with your 32 Gold coins. You might notice an inherent value proposition there.\n\nAlso unlike Gold, the Bitcoin supply is, in fact, limited and finite. It is set to reap immediate benefits going forward when it comes to supply and demand, the most basic sound money concept. No worries about mere fiat currency principles like inflation or deflation. You can chart the amount of digital currency in circulation at any time in the future. No bearded elite men who are totally unaccountable to the public or even their government because they are private subcontractors who operate above the law are manipulating your Bitcoin value and supply. Everything is left up to the market. Miners win when they play by the rules of the protocol, and don’t try to corrupt it. That’s a train to nowhere. The system works, and has many, many more practical applications as money that we haven’t even tapped into yet.\n\nAlso, a little bit of economic history is in order. Argentina has had issues with capital controls, and the Argentinian Peso has been under siege for the last few years. Has this helped Gold reigns some of it’s lost value? No, Gold has continued it’s almost 3-year slide unabated. Bitcoin business, job growth, and ownership has exploded in the region, and it certainly hasn’t hurt Bitcoin’s overall value. March 25th of 2013. Cyprus’s endures its economic failure as uninsured deposits are taken in a central bank “Bail-in”. Look up the values of Gold or Bitcoin in that 2-3 week period. Gold saw little movement while Bitcoin saw it’s first real spike in value, doubling in price, and passing $100 USD in value for the first time. You really think that was just a coincidence? The common man has proven in most recent history that they don’t run to Gold when times get tough. They head somewhere else for real economic value they can use.\n\nIs Bitcoin better than Gold? As an investment, no, but with a caveat. There is so much we don’t about Bitcoin yet. What technology and applications that are yet undiscovered. Just how far will its economic impact be felt? How many of the world’s 5-6 billion unbanked population will Bitcoin affect, either directly or indirectly? Bitcoin can be sent by SMS text message, so you don’t even need an Internet connection, computer, or smartphone. They just make the task much easier.\n\nBitcoin could evolve into Bitcoin 2.0 or 9.0 like a Windows program. The chances of it’s named changing are slim, as slim as the chances of a competing currency passing it in the open market. It has established itself as a solid brand, protocol, and technology. It has established itself as something governments, and the media can’t wish away through propaganda. And it has established itself as a medium of exchange of unlimited potential, unlike the exchange of the elite, Gold.\n\nBitcoin is far from perfect. We haven’t really figured out how to protect things we can’t hold in our hands. We haven’t evolved to that point. Is that Bitcoin’s fault? It looks Bitcoin is going to spur on our digital security capabilities, making for many high paying jobs worldwide in the process. Does your government like job and economic growth in emerging technologies? Pass regulations that support the Bitcoin technology, not showing fear of it. That’s a great first step.\n\nGold will always be Gold\n\nGold does what Gold does, and nothing does that better. It represents value and cachet. That alone can power a global economy, directly. And your government and your girlfriend love it for that. Bitcoin, over the next decade, will probably end up doing everything else you’ll need. From sharing your wealth anytime, anywhere, to taking your wealth with you with peace of mind, to buying your daily necessities. One is valuable for all times, and one adds value at all times.\n\nIf you can get both, it would be wise to do so. In the pursuit to find a superior form of money, this is not much of a contest. Gold isn’t going to outsmart anybody. It doesn’t learn new tricks or become more versatile with a new app. Bitcoin has talents no precious metal or fiat currency can every dream of having on their own.\n\nIn this economic war of attrition, where economies like Greece, Cyprus, Argentina, Venezuela and Zimbabwe collapse into ruin, expect Gold and Bitcoin to stand tall. To not only survive, as the ashes of these ancient economic models come crashing down around them, but they will thrive. Many more nations are set to join them.\n\nMaybe the world can learn from Iceland how to forge national sound money principles that will benefit them for many years. They have suffered economic turmoil almost to the scale of those above, but have rebounded incredibly well due to superior policy and leadership. Don’t count on the world learning from their success, but they should be commended for their wise investments. Nations-states really don’t like playing fiscal copycat, unless forced to do so at the barrel of a gun. Iceland is a great story and should be scaled up to larger economies, but that not how the era of central banking works. It makes too much sense.\n\nIn closing, both Gold or Bitcoin will be great long-term investments. Gold because of it’s cachet and brand name as valuable commodity. Bitcoin because of it’s finite supply and ability to increase it’s own value within it’s own technological advances. Many thousands of jobs and businesses will be made directly and indirectly based on Bitcoin technology over the next several years worldwide. Still, you give the incumbent Gold an advantage with it’s established infrastructure and market recognition, which spans thousands of years.\n\nWhich one wins as a money or currency substitute however, after the Dollar exits the global economy, is as easy as pie to recognize. Bitcoin wins by a very technical knockout.\n\nImages provided by Shutterstock, Wikimedia and GoldPrice.org\n\nIs Gold or Bitcoin a better money for you in the future? Share above and comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '“India has one of the largest unbanked populations, 50% of the population is unbanked, I think Bitcoin can play a part in banking the unbanked.” - Sunny Ray, Unocoin Co-Founder\n\nBitcoin and the Indian market being a rare combination, especially after early central bank disapproval makes Sunny Ray and Sathvik Vishwanath, the co-founders of Unocoin, amongst the few in the league of Bitcoin entrepreneurs in India.\n\nSunny Ray graduated an Electrical engineer from The University of Toronto and spent a few years in clean energy before he left to get into financial services.\n\nJust around 2008-09, when the financial meltdown occurred. He vividly remembers asking a lot of questions about how the financial system worked and asking the question, “what is money?”\n\nAnd even though he had accumulated several licenses and met many a financial whiz, nobody could truly explain to him, what money was. This led him to eventually leave financial services and foray into a passion of his, robotics, which he pursued for 7-8 years before eventually discovering Bitcoin.\n\nThat’s when everything changed both for Sunny and arguably the Indian Bitcoin market.\n\nUnocoin became the first Indian Bitcoin start-up to be funded internationally in August 2014 when legendary investor Barry Silbert infused US$250,000 in Unocoin.\n\nToday, the Bangalore based start-up has more than 11,000 registered users and is growing at a rate of more than 25% month over month (across the board).\n\nCoinTelegraph: How would you describe the position of the Bitcoin community in India?\n\nSunny Ray: I would say it’s on the rise. But it’s still 2-3 years behind the rest of the world when compared to China or USA.\n\nCT: You were one of the founders of Bitcoin Alliance India, what initiatives have you’ll spearheaded there?\n\nSR: The alliance started off with me and my wife and two other guys and eventually grew close to 1,000 people in Bangalore alone. So through those meet ups we had bankers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, technologists and other people come together and talk Bitcoin. We eventually threw the Global Bitcoin Conference in Bangalore and took some big attempts at mining. We also began distributing physical bitcoins in an effort to educate the public and policymakers.\n\n“If you look at the Internet, India was fairly late to that party as well but once they showed up, there was no stopping them. I think the same thing is happening with Bitcoin.”\n\nCT: The rise of Bitcoin seems to be very slow in India, where do you think the resistance in acceptance lies? Do Indians seem inclined to accept and understand Bitcoin?\n\nSR: Being a Canadian raised by Indian parents, the one thing I know about Indian people is that they always show up late to parties, but once they show up, there is no stopping them. I think the same principle follows in other aspects of India. If you look at the Internet, India was fairly late to that party as well but once they showed up, there was no stopping them. I think the same thing is happening with Bitcoin.\n\nIndia is the golden place for Bitcoin for a couple of reasons:\n\nBitcoin is often referred to as digital gold and India is the largest importer of gold, India has the largest number of IT professionals, people who actually have the technical chops to understand Bitcoin, so if you mix those two elements, digital gold definitely has a huge potential here. So that’s one big reason. The remittance market is about a US$700 billion market with about US$70 billion coming into India, so India is the largest inward remitter. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, a couple of months ago in front of the G-20 mentioned that one of the main goals of the country is to try and bring down the cost of remittance and I think Bitcoin is positioned to do that. With Bitcoin you could easily bring the cost of remittance down from 10% to 1%. I also think that India has one of the largest unbanked populations, 50 % of the population is unbanked, I think Bitcoin can play a part in banking the unbanked.\n\nCT: You mentioned earlier the applicability of Bitcoin in microfinance and helping the unbanked. With the latest changes in RBI regulation towards payment bank policy, do you think Bitcoin could play a bigger role in the Indian microfinance sector? And would that be a play that Unocoin would be interested in?\n\nSR: Yeah, we’re definitely very interested in potentially being able to help the unbanked. But Bitcoin the way it stands today I don’t think is very well positioned to help the unbanked because it is volatile, while say for a millionaire to loose 5-10% of the asset value in a week wouldn’t be a big deal but for someone in a rural area with an income equal to US$5-10 it would be extremely risky. So I don’t think that BTC as a savings mechanism makes lot of sense for the poorest but the protocol of Bitcoin could definitely help in the rural sector.\n\nThere are companies such as blockstream and colorstream, which are working towards launching a digital rupee or digital dollar that would have all the benefits of Bitcoin. Being able to move it around fast, freely and cheaply but at the same time it would be tied to the national currency, so I think something of that sort would be a safer option for the poor immediately. However, in time we’re sure that Bitcoin itself could also help with microfinance.\n\n“Unocoin is the leading Bitcoin Company in India and we are a wallet service similar to Coinbase[.]”\n\nCT: How has Unocoin managed to integrate Bitcoin in the average Indian’s wallet?\n\nSR: Unocoin is the leading Bitcoin Company in India and we are a wallet service similar to Coinbase where we enable people to come onto our system and buy and sell Bitcoin. This off course after you get through our extensive registration and KYC process. You can send us money from your bank account and we send across the equivalent in bitcoin or you could send across bitcoin and we would send the equivalent in Rupees, so our main role has been to be the bridge between the old and the new financial system in India.\n\nCT: With the various innovations taking place in the Bitcoin space, one such innovation being the Gemini exchange in New York, which seeks to have a regulatory approach towards Bitcoin, what kind of approach in terms of regulations would you foresee in India in terms of dealing with Bitcoin?\n\nSR: So far the main source of concern for regulators in India has been protection, so governments want to make sure that if people are dealing with bitcoin or Bitcoin companies in India that people are not left in the wind. So most of the regulation should be around protocols like Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and most of that we take care of at Unocoin, so we require anyone who uses our system to go through the process of providing legal documentation, we do a phone verification and then we do all of that in the absence of regulation, but we believe that in the near future that those types of verification will come into play.\n\nI know that our investor Barry Silbert has just launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which will now enable anyone in the US through their 401 (k) or their retirement savings plan to actually invest in bitcoin. All these institutions are making sure they play fair with regulators so that is definitely a big step.\n\nCT: What would you say is the typical path of a Bitcoin entrepreneur in India?\n\nSR: Well, it’s definitely riddled with failure and trying different things. Like for us we’ve explored mining, throwing conferences, using physical bitcoins, we just kept trying different things, which were exciting for us. Then finally we discovered that a trading platform would be most useful, especially because we ourselves in India were in the need of a trading platform where we could buy and sell bitcoin easily and safely.\n\nSo scratching your own itch is a big part of entrepreneurship especially in India.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

They have attracted some of the best business minds and biggest VC investors. But when Connie Gallippi went to San Jose for her first conference in back in 2013, she saw a different sort of opportunity altogether; the opportunity to create a philanthropic organization that would use the power of bitcoin to help the disadvantaged citizens of the world.\n\nIt’s been a whirlwind journey for Gallippi since the idea of the BitGive Foundation first took root back in San Jose. Over the past year and a half, the Foundation has attained status as the first bitcoin 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and has funded projects on behalf of half a dozen charitable campaigns. Most recently, Gallippi visited Kenya to witness the completion of a bitcoin-funded well in conjunction with The Water Project.\n\nThis Sunday marks World Water Day. Bitcoin Magazine caught up with Connie Gallippi to talk about BitGive and to find out more about BitGive’s involvement with The Water Project.\n\nBack in February of 2014, Gallippi was looking to fund a water-related project based in Africa when she saw an announcement from Peter Chasse, founder of The Water Project, announcing that his organization was accepting cryptocurrency donations.\n\n“…emerging cryptocurrencies are extremely low cost and in some cases nearly free to exchange and transfer. The cryptocurrency movement is based on transparency, openness and de-centralization in its design and implementation. At the same time, users enjoy an anonymity more akin to cash-based transactions. The critical difference being that underlying valuations are not decided by a central authority and the movement of that value is unencumbered.” — Peter Chasse\n\n“It was serendipity,” says Gallippi. With a fifteen-year career background in the environmental not-for-profit industry, Gallippi was already keenly interested in water-based issues. Finding a company that understood and was enthusiastic about the potential of bitcoin seemed to be the perfect fit for BitGive. After a thorough investigation of the charity, BitGive was ready to move forward.\n\nGallippi set a fundraising goal of $10,000 — the full amount required to complete one well. It was a huge task, but Gallippi wanted the project to be entirely funded by the Bitcoin community. “There was lots of money floating around at the time,” says Gallippi, so she was optimistic. And while it took longer than Gallippi initially expected, by the fall of 2014, BitGive had surpassed its goal, raising in excess of $11,000.\n\nFrom that point on, the project proved to be worth all the effort. “It was an amazing experience to walk hand-in-hand with them through the whole thing” says Gallippi of her relationship with The Water Project. She explains that it was a completely in-depth endeavor; the charity works not only to build the well, but to involve and educate the community regarding the well and its maintenance, as well as sanitation and health.\n\n“They really do quality work,” says Gallippi. “And they are also really excited about Bitcoin!”\n\nAs the date of the well’s completion approached, Gallippi began to consider the possibility of visiting the Kenyan village where it was being dug. Wouldn’t it be amazing if she could tell the Bitcoin community the story of how their donations made this project possible?\n\nWhen she reached out to the Water Project to see if they could help her locate the project and approach the community, serendipity struck again. Peter Chasse told her about a film crew that was going to be visiting a few of their completed projects and he agreed to include the BitGive well. He also invited her to join the team in the field in Kenya. Gallippi put together a funding proposal that would cover the cost of her trip and a bitcoin-oriented film for the BitGive project; and within a few days, BitPesa stepped in to cover the costs.\n\n“It was amazing,” said Gallippi. “We got the whole film project settled in about four days.”\n\nThe Water Project wasn’t the first of BitGive’s campaigns. It kicked off its efforts back in 2013 by spearheading the first Bitcoin Black Friday charity drive, raising funds for Save the Children following the Philippines’ typhoon disaster. It has since supported campaigns to provide tornado relief to the US midwestern states, to stop the spread of the ebola virus, and support TECHO building homes in the favelas of Brazil. Most recently, BitGive has become involved with Medic Mobile, a platform that supports health-care workers in remote communities of the developing world using mobile technology.\n\n“Magical things have happened”\n\nAlthough the BitGive Foundation is largely a one-woman operation — Gallippi is the only person working full-time at the moment — it is not without a support system. Since its inception in 2013, Gallippi has had the support of BitPay co-founders Stephen Pair and Tony Gallippi, Connie Gallippi’s brother.\n\n“Tony and Stephen really helped to pull in key players from Day One,” said Gallippi. For example, they helped her to connect with Patrick Murck, who now sits on the Board of the BitGive Foundation. Through Murck, Gallippi was able to secure pro bono legal work from Perkins Coie, who took care of securing the charity’s status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\n\nTo date, BitPay is a Platinum founding donor to BitGive. “We would never be here without them,” says Gallippi.\n\nThe BitGive Foundation has also received support from other companies and individuals in the community. Most recently, they teamed with both ChangeTip and Purse.io in its efforts to make donation collection from the bitcoin community easier. Anyone collecting tips through ChangeTip has the option to redirect their tips directly to BitGive. All people have to do is log into their ChangeTip accounts and click on “Redirect your tips to a Cause.”.\n\nSimilarly, shoppers at Purse.io have the option to participate in the Amazon Smile program. Purse.io enables bitcoin users to shop on Amazon.com for a discount. When shoppers choose to participate in the Amazon Smile program, 0.5% of their purchase amount is donated to the charity of their choice. BitGive has enlisted bitcoin companies to match all Purse.io Smile donations over the next few months.\n\n“Right now,” says Gallippi, “Chain.com will match all donations,” with the matching amounts going directly to the BitGive Foundation, regardless of where the original charitable donation is directed. For example, even if a user chooses to direct the 0.5% donation to the Red Cross, Chain.com will send an equivalent amount to BitGive.\n\nTo find out more about the BitGive Foundation, or to become member or make a donation, visit their website at bitgivefoundation.org. An in-depth interview with Connie Gallippi is also available on decentral.tv.\n\nThis is part 1 of a 4-piece series highlighting charitable work by the Bitcoin community for World Water Day.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Stan Patyrak / The Water Project.', 'An Altcoin is a Bitcoin derivative – not the financial term. As if Bitcoin terminology wasn’t hard enough already. The source code for Bitcoin is open source. Meaning anyone can make a few small changes and launch a Bitcoin clone.\n\nClosed-minded Bitcoin proponents argue Altcoins are a waste of time, energy and resources. They detract from Bitcoin. When an Altcoin fails, the user experience damages the cryptocurrency “brand.” Developers are better off working on incorporating their ideas with Bitcoin.\n\nIn effect, Bitcoin 2.0 will be Bitcoin. That gets no argument from me.\n\nRipple Brings Out Bitcoin Insecurity\n\nWhat about digital currencies that don’t share source code with Bitcoin?\n\nThough Ripple began in 2004, it wasn’t until 2011 that Jeb McCaleb gave the payment protocol a reboot to compete against Bitcoin. Before focusing on the currency, McCaleb worked on eDonkey, a precursor to BitTorrent.\n\nMcCaleb was the founder of Mt. Gox and personally sold the exchange to the disgraced CEO Mark Karpeles. Karpeles famously lost over 800,000 of his customers bitcoins when his Bitcoin exchange was hacked. After selling Gox, McCaleb founded Ripple.\n\nAlso Read: Undercover Silk Road Agent Believed Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR) to Be Mark Karpeles of Mt. Gox\n\nParts of Ripple are open source though the majority holder of the currency is Ripple Labs – ‘core developers’. Approximately 32,000,000,000 XRP are in circulation. Over twice that amount is held by Ripple Labs.\n\nObviously, Ripple is not after the same thing as Bitcoin. A child of five would understand this. Send someone to fetch a child of five.\n\nRipple is a payment system; a trust-based, proprietary, payment system. Just because that doesn’t satisfy the crypto punk narrative doesn’t mean Ripple lacks value.\n\nThe SWIFT bank messaging system is a perfect example. Over 15 million banking transactions go through the SWIFT network every day. If Ripple is SWIFT 2.0 more power to Ripple. It just means greater adoption of digital currencies and easier access to trading fiat for bitcoins (fiat-crypto for bitcoins, perhaps?).\n\nDoes having more options for obtaining bitcoins detract from Bitcoin? Of course not. Ripple is not an enemy.\n\nNo-One-Cares (Coin)\n\nRemember when Feathercoin was 51% attacked, and Bitcoin users fled back to dollars? What about Aircoin? Apparently there were two of those. Trollcoin, UFOCoin, TakeOutCoin, MemeCoin, MillionaireCoin, one Altcoin is literally named Scamcoin. These things fail all the time. Bitcoin is unaffected.\n\nAltcoins are like a self-sustaining sandbox. Developers are usually the largest holders of their coin; they do most of the early mining. The process is called Premining and considered an attribute of a failed cryptocurrency. Even though this is how Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s founder, obtained so many coins.\n\nAltcoins are one of Bitcoin’s greatest strengths. They aren’t competitors as much as they are requirements of the antifragile nature of cryptocurrency.\n\nIf dollar bills are a 0 on the spectrum of innovation and Bitcoin’s at 10, SWIFT is 2 and Ripple is a 5. Not everyone is ready to make the jump from 0 to 10. For some, the transition will need to be gentle. If you truly believe in Bitcoin, check the elitism. Stop letting perfection get in the way of doing good and see these competitors as stepping stones towards a better financial environment overall.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""First Global Credit launches international market trading competition with prize fund worth 20BTC.\n\nThe month long competition is pitting would-be Wolves of Wall Street against each other as they use a competition trading account loaded with 100 virtual BTC to try and create the largest profits.\n\nFree to enter, the market based competition may be the first taste many users have of the world of high pressure day-trading.

Have you ever wondered what causes these price fluctuations? Is it something to be worried about? Also, what does the future hold for bitcoin?\n\nIt is assumed that the value of bitcoin is directly dependent on its use for transactions. It is believed that an increase in bitcoin transactions increases its value. But a working paper published by Hong Kong based Bitquant Research Laboratories begs to differ. Bitquant is a company involved in R&D supporting high risk/high reward open source financial systems.\n\nBitquant has derived a macroeconomic model for bitcoin. According to this model, the value of bitcoin is heavily dependent on people’s willingness to save it. The derived model, in its mathematical form clearly shows that the price of bitcoin is inversely proportional to the likelihood of a bitcoin transaction.\n\np b = 1 / l t ? t ,\n\nWhere p b = price of the bitcoin, l t = likelihood of bitcoin transaction and ? t is a constant (you can read the whole paper here).\n\nWe already know that the bitcoin price is also affected by other external factors like recent news updates etc. Any changes in the economic situation or certain new developments in the news causes the bitcoin price to increase or decrease. Any situation that may lead to bitcoin hoarding will trigger its price to slide.\n\nEven though these fluctuations seem to make bitcoin appear as an unstable and unreliable currency, its long term outlook as a transaction alternative for fiat currency looks promising at this stage.\n\nReasons why you shouldn’t worry\n\nLots of people (including the bitcoin community) are still skeptical about bitcoin as the currency of the future. They doubt whether bitcoin will continue to exist in the next couple of years. The current technology lifecycle of bitcoin is still at its nascent stages. It is being adopted and used by a niche set of users. But it won’t stay that way for long. Once a large number of people understand bitcoin and start using it, we can expect it to be used on par with fiat currencies.\n\nIt is assumed that an increase in bitcoin users will cause it to fall into the liquidity trap. In a traditional scenario (with fiat currency) increase in demand should lead to hoarding of bitcoin. Given the total units of bitcoin is limited, it should be hoarded completely in no time, thereby leading to a big increase in its price. But according to the macroeconomic model, when bitcoin price increases, people will use it instead of fiat currency for transactions. Increase in bitcoin transactions reduces the amount of bitcoin hoarded in the system. This causes its price to fall. When the price hits a low, people start saving bitcoin, causing the price to go up again. This self-sustaining cycle in the bitcoin economy will prevent it from falling into the liquidity trap.\n\nIn a nutshell, this macroeconomic model removes any misconceptions about the reasons for fluctuations in the bitcoin price, and it also throws light on the future of bitcoin (it is here to stay!). In addition, it also shows how it will regulate itself to prevent the whole bitcoin economy from crashing.', 'Jared Marx is an attorney at Washington, DC law firm Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis. He advises companies about bitcoin-related regulatory law and represents companies and individuals in civil and criminal proceedings. Here, he discusses why securities law is problematic for bitcoin 2.0 companies operating in the US.\n\nIt is now almost commonplace to see a crypto 2.0 company raise development capital by pre-selling tokens to be used in their proposed project.\n\nEthereum’s multi-million dollar sale of \'ether\' – the \'fuel\' for running its proposed blockchain system – stands out as the most successful to date, but Ethereum is in no way alone.\n\nThe development of this business practice has spawned yet another area of regulatory uncertainty in an industry where legal ambiguity is the norm: American federal securities regulation.\n\nAre tokens securities?\n\nIn short, if those tokens are securities under US federal law, their sale in the United States must either be registered with the SEC (costly and onerous), or there must be an applicable exception to registration (generally meaning that they can only be sold to wealthy people). And somewhat contrary to common sense, the fact that the CFTC thinks that bitcoins are commodities does not, for now, have a significant impact on figuring out whether an offering is a security.\n\nWhile there are better and worse practices for making the case that a company’s particular token is not a security, predictability and a general resolution of this issue is unlikely in the near term.\n\nThe reason for persistent uncertainty on this question is that, unlike other areas of law where legal ambiguity stems primarily from the novelty of cryptocurrency, here more generic questions of law remain open to debate.\n\nFirst, the fundamental federal laws regulating securities were passed during the Great Depression, so not only did Congress write the relevant rules in a paper-and-pencil world, but Congress wrote them with the belief that broad government control of markets was necessary to avoid another disaster like the 1929 crash. The statute is therefore expansive rather than carefully tailored.\n\nSecond – and this is what innovators looking for clarity should understanding more deeply – United States courts have created a system for identifying whether something is a security that is impressionistic rather than rule bound. This means that, barring clarification from the SEC, it is very difficult to predict with certainty how a court would rule on cryptographic token sales.\n\nSEC vs WJ Howey Co.\n\nThe law doesn’t leave parties totally in the dark – there is a nominal test to determine if something is a security. You ask whether a given scheme involves ""[1] an investment of money [2] in a common enterprise [3] with profits [4] to come solely from the efforts of others"".\n\nThat language is from a 1946 United States Supreme Court case called SEC v WJ Howey Co. But the facts of that case, rather than its language, tell more of a story about how you can (or often can’t) predict whether something will be called a security.\n\nIn that 1946 case, a company called Howey in the Hills owned an orange grove in Florida, and offered to sell small parcels of it to tourists who stayed in an affiliated hotel. Howey told interested tourists that, if they bought a parcel of land, then as a practical matter they should also arrange to have someone tend and harvest their orange trees.\n\n“The impressionistic nature of the rules cuts both ways: things that look like a security risk being called one, but an offering that doesn’t look like a security stands a good chance of staying out of the line of fire.”\n\nHowey then suggested that – surprise – they were the best company to do that. Purchasers who hired Howey to tend their trees (and 85% of purchases did so) gave Howey exclusive rights to the land for 10 years, without any right to cancel the contract.\n\nIn short, Howey set up a system that would more or less allow it to get investors without actually selling ownership in Howey’s business itself. The SEC found out, and sued to stop Howey under the securities laws.\n\nIn response, Howey convinced two lower courts they hadn’t offered a security for sale. But the United States Supreme Court was unimpressed. The Justices said the law required them to look past legal formalities, and that, under the spirit of the Securities Act, Howey had offered a security.\n\nTo the Justices, the structure of the offering (a sale of land, plus a management contract) was less important than the fact that, in their view, the offering was an attempted end-run around the general rule that you have to get regulatory approval before you allow the general public to invest in your business. In doing so, the High Court established what came to be a consistent focus on a general standard rather than an articulated rule in this area.\n\nIn a later case, for example, the Court conversely deemed shares of \'stock\' in a low-income housing development not to be securities, even though the word \'stock\' appears in the statutory definition of a security. In that case, the Supreme Court again held that labels matter little, and that the housing development stock – which could not materially appreciate in value and could only be owned by a tenant in the development – was little more than a way of organizing leaseholds.\n\nReducing uncertainty\n\nThe Court has also rejected other potentially useful markers for whether something is a security. For example, the Supreme Court has held that participation in the revenues of an enterprise is not required for an investment to be a security, and that the expected ""profit"" from a security can come solely from market appreciation of the purchase.\n\nNonetheless, companies that want to presell tokens or pursue other similar sources of funding should not despair. First, there is some potential relief on the way, through regulations mandated by the JOBS Act, which would allow ordinary people to purchase unregistered securities offered by small businesses – though those regulations have not yet materialized.\n\nMoreover, United States courts – and the SEC – have ruled on hundreds of different types of offerings, and those precedents are helpful in determining the best way to move forward in this area. Further, the impressionistic nature of the rules cuts both ways: things that look like a security risk being called one, but an offering that doesn’t look like a security stands a good chance of staying out of the line of fire.\n\nSo while a lack in legal clarity in token sales looks to be unavoidable for now, careful companies and careful lawyers can still find ways to reduce uncertainty.\n\nOrange grove image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

This annual ritual has gone on unchanged since 1934.\n\nAnd the general tone of the remainder of the report solidifies what the opening lines hint at: that MasterCard – and third-party payment processors in general – are becoming old news, and are likely living their last days.\n\nCompetition, Competition, Competition\n\nMasterCard\'s SEC report mentions the word cryptocurrency three different times, and each time, it\'s under the heading of the word “competition.”\n\nFirst the report mentions that MasterCard competes against cash, checks, other credit card issuers, wire transfers, mobile payments, and cryptocurrency.\n\nIt then goes on to mention cryptocurrency again in its “startup and emerging competitors” category:\n\n“These competitors include digital wallet providers such as PayPal, AliPay and Amazon, merchants. [...] mobile operator services, services such as mPesa, handset manufacturers, and cryptocurrencies.”\n\nThe report mentions cryptocurrency for a third time when it later reads:\n\n“Rapid and significant technological changes could occur, resulting in new and innovative payment methods (including cryptocurrencies) and programs that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of MasterCard products.”\n\nThe Beginning of the End for MasterCard?\n\nMasterCard then goes on to discuss threats to their business model. The first and foremost is government regulations, which is ironic, seeing as they lobby for regulations as a matter of practice. The next named threat is the cost-cutting taking place among competitors:\n\n""Over the past several years, we have experienced continued pricing pressure. The demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements [...] moderates our growth. We may not be able to continue our expansion strategy [...] at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future […]. We may not succeed in [cost containment] efforts.”\n\nPerhaps this rather gloomy outlook was predictable after MasterCard\'s highly uninformed video release last year – you know, the one that attempted to paint trustless money as inferior to fiat:\n\nOh the Times, They Are A-Changin\'\n\nAll considered, MasterCard\'s report gives heavy indication that the times, they are a-changing. When Internet protocols like cryptocurrency simply cut out the middle man in value transfer, the costs of transacting go down significantly.\n\nIn other words, the reasons for using a middle-man are disappearing. The “decentralization of all the things” has begun, taking such deep root in payments that one of the world\'s largest credit card companies is not sure they can compete.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Water demand tends to grow at double the rate of population growth, the report said. The global population is expected to grow to 9.1 billion people by 2050, up from the current 7.2 billion.\n\nMore people living in cities also put strain on water supplies. The report estimates that 6.3 billion people, or about 69% of the world’s population, will be living in urban areas by 2050, up from the current 50%.\n\nThe biggest drain on water resources is agriculture, which uses about 70% of the world’s fresh water supplies. Tapping into groundwater supplies to make up for surface-water deficits strains resources. The report said that 50% of the world relies solely on groundwater to meet basic daily needs and that 20% of the world’s aquifers are already over-exploited.\n\nThe issue of water scarcity rose again to prominence recently when a NASA scientists warned that drought-stricken California only has about a year’s worth of water left. Recently, MarketWatch’s David Weidner looked into the California water crisis and Mark Hulbert pointed out seven ways of exploiting water shortage concerns.', ""Cocoa Commodity Price Technical Outlook\n\nCocoa is the basis of chocolate. The word cocoa is derived from the Spanish word cacao as the cacao tree is native to Latin America. It originated in the Amazon and Orinoco basins which are in Colombia and Venezuela. However, it is now West Africa which dominates world production of cocoa with the Ivory Coast being by far the largest producer.\n\nLet's investigate the technicals of the cocoa price taking a top down approach beginning with the yearly chart.\n\nCocoa Yearly Chart\n\nI have drawn a downtrend line connecting the 1977 and 2011 highs and an uptrend line connecting the 1965 and 2000 lows. This sets up a massive consolidation zone in which price is currently trading. Price is near resistance from the downtrend line and I think price can give this trend line one more test before heading back down.\n\nThe Parabolic Stop and Reverse (PSAR) indicator has a bearish bias with the dots above price. I am looking for price to trade up and fall just short of taking these dots out which currently stand at US$3604.\n\nThe Stochastic indicator currently has a bullish bias but it is not looking very strong and it wouldn't surprise to see it roll over.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator still has a bullish bias with the blue line above the red line but it looks to be tiring.\n\nI have added Fibonacci retracement levels of the move up from 1965 low to 1977 high. The 2000 low was right at support from the 88.6% level and I favour the next major low to be around the 76.4% level which stands at US$1429 and perhaps a touch low.\n\nI doubt price will trade back to the uptrend line instead putting in a major low just above it.\n\nLet's move on to the monthly chart\n\nCocoa Monthly Chart\n\nThe Bollinger Bands show price came right back down to and bounced off the lower band. Price now looks to be testing that low of US$2669 but as long as that low holds then I favour a move up to new rally highs.\n\nI have drawn a horizontal line at the 2014 high at US$3399. I am expecting price to trade marginally above there before turning back down thereby putting in a false break top.\n\nFrom the yearly analysis, we know PSAR resistance is at US$3604. Therefore, I expect the final rally high to be below there and above US$3399.\n\nThe Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) made a new high reading at the 2014 high. I would like to see the final rally high be accompanied by a lower reading - a bearish divergence. Let's see.\n\nThe Stochastic indicator is looking oversold so a move back up now would be no surprise here.\n\nI have added moving averages with time periods of 100 (red) and 200 (black) which is evidence of the bull trend in play with the 100ma being well above the 200ma. The red line also looks to be providing support for the recent move down.\n\nI have drawn a Fibonacci Fan and I expect the final rally high to be around resistance from the 38.2% angle which also provided resistance for the 2014 high. I then expect the final pullback low to be around the 88.6% angle.\n\nI have added Fibonacci retracement levels of the move up from 2000 low to 2011 high and I expect the final pullback low to be at least back to the 76.4% level which stands at US$1431 and perhaps a touch lower.\n\nLet's now skip to the daily chart for a closer look.\n\nCocoa Daily Chart\n\nI have drawn a horizontal line which denotes the previous swing high level set at US$3016 in January 2015. Price recently busted marginally above that line thereby putting in a higher low.\n\nToday price looks to have turned back up after putting in a higher low with a big bullish outside reversal candle. I now expect price to rally to new highs once again.\n\nThe PSAR resistance, denoted by the dots, was nailed by the big reversal higher today.\n\nThe Stochastic indicator shows a bullish crossover while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator looks to be threatening on.\n\nSo, it looks like it's up, up and away now before being down and out a bit further into the future.\n\nAnd as for my favourite kind of chocolate - milk chocolate or dark chocolate?

03/22/2015,"['Bitcoin’s reputation, it’s brand, is approaching crisis mode.\n\nPeople keep asking me “When will Bitcoin go mainstream?” or “Why hasn’t the world jumped on Bitcoin yet?” There are a lot of issues holding Bitcoin back, from the general complexity of the technology, and it’s use, to the questions about it’s legal status. For the newbie, it’s not as easy to get as it should be. And many developed nations don’t need a better currency at this very moment (but that day fast approaches.) The real problem with Bitcoin is where the money meets the Blockchain, the Bitcoin exchanges. The biggest issue facing Bitcoin is trust.\n\nI don’t blame someone new to Bitcoin for not investing because the Bitcoin ecosystem is very volatile, from price to national regulation, to taxes. Bitcoin is all over the place; very unstructured. Very “Wild West”. An economic revolution logically would be very chaotic in the early years, and it reflects the chaos in the fiat currency markets as well. As fiat currencies and national economies are exploding in a downward spiral of bail-outs and “quantitative easing”, Bitcoin is experiencing plenty of growing pains in its ascent.\n\nBitcoin’s Reputation is up to the Bitcoin Exchanges\n\nThe biggest pain right now is the inability of the Bitcoin community to police itself, and the largest organizations within the ecosystem, the Bitcoin exchanges. As a Bitcoin journalist, I see much too often the biggest news stories in this space are either:\n\nA. An exchange has been hacked and has lost thousands of Bitcoins B. An exchange has shut down, and the unknown owners have stolen the Bitcoin\n\nDays ago, the United Kingdom said they will step in and begin regulating Bitcoin exchanges more strictly, at least how they interact with British citizens. What about the rest of us? Is it really Britain’s job to regulate the Bitcoin exchanges? Britain has generally been on the positive side of Bitcoin, and it’s development. Some countries like Britain, Japan, The Isle of Man, and Singapore have taken the side of Bitcoin, and it’s development. My question is why leave it up to national governments? This is something the community should be able to handle internally.\n\nAlso read: Jim Harper: The Bitcoin Foundation Hasn’t Reached its Potential\n\nOrganizations like The Bitcoin Foundation should show some leadership and an interest in this serious issue plaguing the community. They go to Washington and lobby politicians. Politicians should be asking them “What are you doing about the rampant thefts and Bitcoin exchange closures?” That anybody can open an exchange, where you are handling other people’s funds, and is unaccountable to anyone in the community is a crime. At any point, any exchange owner can disappear like a thief in the night with thousands of Bitcoins. This not only badly hurts Bitcoin’s reputation, but it hurts all exchanges. Just like when a baseball player takes steroids. Now, who knows who is clean? The trust of the entire group is badly compromised by the deception of a few.\n\nThe Mt. Gox Effect\n\nEver since Mt. Gox, exchange closures and thefts have increased, not decreased. Call it “The Mt. Gox Effect”. Now “bad actors” are infecting the Bitcoin community like a cancer, and it all started at Mt. Gox. It’s like the community learned the wrong way to do things from it’s mentor, and now it’s running with it. Maybe Mark Karpeles and unknown accomplices stole 800k+ Bitcoins and got away with it? We may never know. Maybe this is a game of Follow The Leader, and this is the way Bitcoin scammers will work until they are stopped. Open an exchange, collect BTC for a year, close the exchange, and say you were hacked or don’t even bother! Just close up shop with all the BTC you can carry!\n\nIt is clear as day that the Bitcoin exchange industry has not done much to police itself, and needs oversight. They are too important as a point of contact for new Bitcoins users. There is too much money on the line, and there is too much at stake. As Bitcoin value continues to increase over time, this problem can only get worse, as the stake in this economic game rise, potentially exponentially. This issue needs to be addressed, internally. Now.\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation or other collective community body needs to get on this issue post haste. Every exchange should be cataloged as far as their leadership’s names, addresses, identification, legal status, etc. Just like the Institute for Highway Safety does with automotive crash tests; each exchange should be reviewed and judged for how safe they are to process funds. What security measures they are using, and then publicly list them, grade them, for effectiveness and safety. Create an ideal community standard for all participants to strive for. They should be accredited by a third party, like the Better Business Bureau, and consumer reviews should be added to the governing website for further confirmation. And community leaders like Blockchain.info, Andreas Antonopoulos, Marc Andreessen, The Bitcoin Foundation, and the Bitcoin exchanges themselves should be actively discussing how to put this necessary leadership in place.\n\nRegulate bitcoin?\n\nAm I advocating “regulating” Bitcoin? Absolutely not! This is not about controlling the amount of bitcoins held by a 3rd party, or putting in a governing body to tax or remove bitcoins from anyone. What does need to happen is well below the threshold of the establishment’s level of regulation, as a communal form of self-regulation carried out by the community’s users. Promote the strongest members of the Bitcoin exchange community, and make those who are not meeting community, not regulatory, standards outcasts. Create a level of competition for ethical and secure economic behavior for Bitcoin exchanges to uphold. “The Wild West” needs to end this year. We need to grow up, as a community, and stop running Bitcoin’s reputation into the ground. We need to be better than this. And Bitcoin’s technology deserves better stewardship. And the exchanges themselves should work together to bolster their weak reputation as an industry. They should be embarrassed as a whole.\n\nMy advice to people new to Bitcoin is “Do not use a Bitcoin exchange until they submit to an internal review or regulation in the Bitcoin community.” You are better off with LocalBitCoins.com or FreeBitcoins.com to get started. Start small, learn how to use them, and don’t go big until the community addresses these serious trust issues. We have some of the world’s greatest technology, and we’re blowing it, out of greed and overall mismanagement. We’re handling Bitcoin’s development as poorly as governments are handling their fiat currencies. We haven’t learned anything from their mistakes.\n\nBitcoin needs a Daddy to manage it’s growth and largest operating systems. That the Prime Minister of England was the first to step up in Bitcoin’s defense is a shame. It’s on us, not him.\n\nHow would you improve exchanges and Bitcoin exchange oversight?

This means that people across the region will soon have access to a software platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and digital commodities with traditional banking integration.\n\nBitt co-founders Gabriel Abed and Oliver Gale say their plan is to have digital currencies stand side by side with traditional currencies throughout the Caribbean in the not too distant future. Following the company’s official launch, bitcoin, the world’s first decentralised digital currency, will become accessible to citizens across the region, including the estimated 60 per cent who are currently unbanked, or under banked.\n\n“We serve the international market but are focused and centred on the Caribbean offering the core services of mobile digital wallets, international remittances and e-commerce merchant solutions utilising new software called bitcoin and blockchain,” Gale, the company’s CFO said.\n\nBitt, which is based in Hastings, Barbados, is offering a system that is completely branded, built, designed and managed in the Caribbean. The company provides high tech systems at a fraction of the cost of the money transfer systems currently used in the region.\n\nGale and Abed, the company’s CEO, are of the view that traditional legacy financial systems are outdated.\n\n“They have huge buildings and many employees. They have paper systems, centralised management ledgers,” Gale said.\n\nAbed explained: “Everything you can pay for in cash, I can pay for in bitcoin.”\n\nAbed’s involvement in the world of digital currency was a natural progression from his educational pursuits. A graduate of the University of Ontario, Institute of Technology with a Bachelors degree in Information Technology majoring in Network Security, his professional qualifications cover cryptography, software development and intrusion detection systems.\n\nAbed was introduced to cryptocurrencies in early 2010 during his undergrad studies but over the past 12 years, he has been leading software development innovations in the region as part of a team of dedicated developers.\n\nHis business partner, Gale, followed a different academic route, earning an honours degree in accounting and management from the University of Bristol. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2012 and immediately immersed himself in the field,combining his knowledge of traditional finance with a growing knowledge of digital finance.\n\nAt present, Bitt is run by an eight-member team, headed by Abed and Gale, as well as three advisers: Peter Tod, Barry Gale QC and Jeremy Stephen. Once the company is fully implemented, users will be able to sign up to log on to bitt.com, follow the instructions and immediately start accepting bitcoin from anyone around the world.\n\nThe system is being introduced in response to the need for a better payment systems in the region to reduce the high costs and red-tape associated with traditional electronic payment systems.\n\nAccording to a recent ECLAC (Economic Commission of Latin America and the Caribbean) report, the Caribbean needs to lower the cost of remittance services. Digital currencies represent a potential option for doing just that.\n\nAbed and Gale were in Port-of-Spain last week for a meeting organised by ECLAC involving regulators and representatives of digital currency companies. The talks were aimed at developing a framework for regulation of the system.\n\nAt the meeting, held at ECLAC’s sub-regional headquarters for the Caribbean on March 12, Caribbean experts in the field of digital currency reviewed the opportunities and risks associated with that type of currency.\n\nThey also addressed the potential impact digital currencies may have on sectors such as banking, e-commerce and remittance and whether its use can enable improvements to electronic and mobile-based payment systems and low-cost remittance services.\n\nECLAC plans to review national policies in anticipation of the use of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, as well as technologies in the field of digital payments, to determine how they will impact the region.\n\nGale and Abed said there are some challenges in the implementation of the system, including lack of e-commerce-supporting legislation, inadequate technical capability and difficulties working with some local banks, but they are determined to get over those hurdles. In T&T, the enabling legislation is relatively new, and is primarily focused on electronic payments for government systems.\n\nHowever, widespread use of mobile-phones in the region and easy availability to facilitate financial payments or transactions through short message service (SMS) messages and other widely available systems, means there is scope for acceptance and use of digital currencies within a relatively short space of time.\n\nBitcoin uses cryptography-based block-chain technology. At the core of the system is a ledger that can be used to transfer title of ownership to units of digital currency. It is largely self regulating, with features built into the protocol that provide consumer protection and traceability.\n\nThe Bitt co-founders are optimistic that within a matter of months consumers in several parts of the region will be accessing bitcoin’s fully automated, transferable management ledger.\n\n“We are riding a technology wave with finance that is cutting costs, making it faster, making it cheaper, making it possible for people outside of the banking systems to control their money using their mobile phones,” said Abed.\n\n“Our company will provide a regulated environment for these global services in a compliant way.”\n\n\u200bWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is an online payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, who published his invention in 2008, and released it as open-source software in 2009.\n\nThe system is peer-to-peer; users can transact directly without needing an intermediary. Transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the block chain. The ledger uses its own unit of account, also called bitcoin.\n\nThe system works without a central repository or single administrator, which has led the US Treasury to categorise it as a decentralised virtual currency. Bitcoin is often called the first cryptocurrency, although prior proposals existed. Bitcoin is more correctly described as the first decentralised digital currency. It is the largest of its kind in terms of total market value.\n\nBitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into the public ledger.\n\nThis activity is called mining and is rewarded by transaction fees and newly created bitcoins. Besides mining, bitcoins can be obtained in exchange for fiat money, products, and services.\n\nUsers can send and receive bitcoins for an optional transaction fee.\n\nBitcoin as a form of payment for products and services has grown, and merchants have an incentive to accept it because fees are lower than the two to three per cent typically imposed by credit card processors.\n\nDespite a big increase in the number of merchants accepting bitcoin, the cryptocurrency doesn’t have much momentum in retail transactions. Unlike credit cards, any fees are paid by the purchaser, not the vendor.\n\nThe European Banking Authority and other sources have warned that bitcoin users are not protected by refund rights or chargebacks.\n\nThe use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators,legislative bodies, law enforcement, and media.\n\nThey listed money laundering, financing of illicit activities, theft, fraud, tax evasion, and use in black markets as possible.\n\nAs of 2013, the criminal activities centered around theft and black markets. Officials in countries such as the United States also recognised that bitcoin can provide legitimate financial services to customers.\n\nSource: Wikipedia', ""At 17 years old, Louison Dumont is the youngest-ever entrepreneur to be accepted into Boost VC, the California incubator that has so far nurtured five batches of mostly bitcoin startups, but he’s not short on experience.\n\nHaving started mining bitcoin at the age of 13, Dumont boasts more maturity than many in the still-nascent industry (your correspondent included), peppering his conversation with signs of his veteran status and allusions to the tribulations of trading (most of his early bitcoins were unfortunately sold in the $20–$30 range).\n\nDumont, for example, recalls a time when you could mine bitcoin with your GPU and still make a profit, and laughs often when discussing his early attempts to secure unwanted graphics cards from sometimes indifferent friends and relatives.\n\n“I told my parents about bitcoin because I needed money to buy bitcoins on Mt Gox, so for a few weeks I was like ‘Please give me money,’” he said. “At the beginning it was very noisy, but I was mining a lot of bitcoins.”\n\nToday, Dumont is the brains behind Bitproof, one of 24 startups living and working full time at the Boost VC complex in San Mateo. His latest project is a sign of an evolving interest in the space, one that has migrated from speculation to what he considers to be more noble pursuits.\n\nDumont told CoinDesk:\n\n“Trading is a good way to make money, but it’s not very useful. I wanted to do something useful and I had this idea that we can use the blockchain to transfer the ownership of anything.”\n\nBitproof allows users to certify documents through a simple interface that then proves their existence and ownership, the second part of which Dumont contends is an improvement over previous iterations of the idea, like Proof of Existence.\n\n“With that, if you share the file, you know the file exists, but you have no way to prove who created the file,” he explained. “This does ownership, so if you share the file you’re also still the owner.”\n\nChance encounter\n\nMore surprising than his age may be the story behind Dumont’s entrance into Boost VC, which seems to have been propelled by coincidence or perhaps serves as proof that despite its global Internet presence, bitcoin is still a small community.\n\nAt the age of 16, Dumont just happened to have applied for a Thiel Fellowship, and just happened to decide to travel by himself to a summit of other applicants.\n\n“I met a guy who was in Boost, I went to Boost and met [co-founder] Brayton [Williams] and [CEO] Adam [Draper]. It was very natural, I didn’t know anything about Boost,” he said.\n\nThough he didn’t have a deck or presentation, he had already started to code. Whatever the status of Bitproof at the time, Williams and Draper quickly told him to apply and soon he was on his way to San Francisco.\n\nPresentation concerns\n\nRight now, however, things aren’t picture perfect, at least in the sense that Dumont has hit a bit of a roadblock with Bitproof. Demo Day is six weeks away, yet he’s not really sure how he’s going to present the product onstage.\n\nOn one hand, the technology is already tried and tested, on the other, business development remains a pressing hurdle.\n\nUsers can already certify files and protect ideas, transferring the documents through integrations with Box, Dropbox and Google Drive.\n\nBut, a key question for Dumont remains, which demographic is most likely to take to Bitproof?\n\n“I’m going to try to think about it now. It’s very hard to change the way people think. It’s a big challenge to make them use the technology they don’t trust,” he said, echoing the likely unspoken concerns of many other companies in the space.\n\nFinding a use case\n\nThat’s not to say Dumont doesn’t believe people will use Bitproof. Designers and developers who want to certify ownership of their work as a means of on-the-job protection are the most likely candidates, Dumont said.\n\n“It can be very useful for people who do freelance work, and they want that client to pay. You can say I did this and gave it to my client, so he must pay. And if he doesn’t, you can say I have created that,” he explained.\n\nFor now, he’s seeking strategic partnerships while trying to figure out his next move. Without a visa – a difficult task, he says, without a college degree – Dumont believes it’s possible he'll have to return to France to work in the bitcoin industry.\n\nHe also still codes on the side, throwing together Merkle.io, a blockchain search engine in one night over the course of the interview.\n\nStill, he’s optimistic he won’t have to return to his hometown of Blois (there’s only around 15 people into bitcoin in all of France after all, he quips), and that securing investment for Bitproof might be the best available avenue.\n\n“If we succeed it’s going to be huge,” he said. “I’m going to try to find a way.”\n\nThis article has been certified in the bitcoin blockchain via Bitproof.\n\nImages via Bitproof\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin stayed above 250 BTC/USD but the slump was not erased, which might suggest that the short-term trend changed. The rally might have run out of steam and we might have just seen the first signs of the continuation of the long-term decline.\n\nDid you enjoy this article? You may also be interested in reading these ones:', 'While the Bitcoin communities are getting too indulged in blaming Evolution Marketplace for the recent $50 crash, it seems they must be prepared for even more deflationary actions by the end of this year.\n\nThe words may seem a little conspired, but nonetheless they have been truly constructed out of the dotty forecasts of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The US central banking system recently published a press release in which it discussed the possibilities of spiking interest rates sometime this year if, by any chance, they see any further improvements in the labor market and the inflation corrects itself to around 2% over the medium term.\n\nIn addition to this, the proposed hike, if comes into effect, is likely to improve exports, a sector that seemed to have weakened enough due to the zero interest rate scenario. But as many experts believe, the hike will be very modest initially but will pick up by the time the total of eight FOMC meetings have been conducted.\n\nThe Dollar Will Strengthen\n\nOne thing that is definitely going to happen post interest rate hike is farewell to a cheap dollar. High interest rates will attract more foreign investors to yield better returns from their forex investments, causing more demand of the USD. Conversely, a spiked dollar value will also influence Americans to buy foreign products and further to invest in foreign companies.\n\nAnd as we can notice with the multiple currency charts against the USD, the greenback seems to have regaining its grounds after all. According to the analysis published at FXStreet, the dollar’s value has surged notably in the wake of the FOMC’s announcement, despite the released of a “weaker than expected” economic data. The data however was immediately recorded (the values might have corrected by the time you are reading this article).\n\nBitcoin Will Be a Dramatic Treat\n\nIt would be fun to see how a newer trading instrument such as Bitcoin would react to the gradual unwinding of the US market. A stronger dollar would indeed overshadow Bitcoin, especially in times when the cryptocurrency’s value has already been wrecked enough. However, another aspect of this theory depends on the demand of Bitcoin that is also expected to surge this year, thanks to the recent promising mainstream inclusions (read here).\n\nIn the next few months, the Bitcoin community will have to come ahead of its comfort zone to attract both forex and stock investors. There could really be a mood shift that could impact global markets and US companies’ stocks due to a strong USD. If Bitcoin manages to prove itself as an alternative, we might say it will be able to find a stable consolidation. Otherwise, we know how it falls against the dollar — scarily.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

If after that simple lesson, he claims to be a “developer,” I’ll be rather disappointed.\n\nI’d also like to make another statement: while Satoshi Nakamoto, the original Bitcoin developer, was anonymous, he also never cashed in his coins. Wherever and whoever he is, his intentions were scientific, not greedy, in nature. Therefore, his anonymity makes sense while the vast majority of other anonymous developers do not. It is time this community question anonymity when it comes to financially-related projects. If they don’t attach their name to it, we’re crazy to invest our money in it. Sometimes our craziness pays off, but often enough it doesn’t.\n\nThe story of BitBean is a little different. It is a story of an idea being born, the developer trying to break the block chain then cash out, and two members of a nascent community stepping in to save the day.\n\nThe Idea\n\nSimilar to other coins, BitBean had a short “proof-of-work” phase in which ten thousand blocks were found, for a total of 1 billion coins. However, because during the proof-of-work phase people were able to mint coins in the “proof-of-stake” way, only 606 million actual coins existed after the 10,000th block was found.\n\nThere were two main things that set BitBean apart from other, similar coins. The first was that it increased the block size limit of standard Bitcoin to twenty megabytes. In the words of the original developer, a man who never went by anything but “nokat” in all dealings:\n\nBitbean is pro Gavin’s proposal for the Bitcoin 20 megabyte fork. So Bitbean already made it’s maximum block size 20 megabytes!\n\nThis is in reference to the arbitrary increase in block size that Gavin Andresen has suggested. While no consensus has yet been reached about an increased block size, the overall feeling among many is that the size needs to be raised somehow, because at present there is a very irregular block confirmation time phenomenon.\n\nThe other thing that set BitBean apart was its method of proof-of-stake. Not unlike Netcoin for all intents and purposes, BitBeaners may only stake or “mint” coins if their wallet has been opened within the last six hours. Unlike Netcoin, however, there is a set reward, similar to proof-of-work mining, of 1000 coins.\n\nCoins are supposed to be a payment system. Bitbean’s PoS encourages people to actually process transactions instead of hoarding their coins and only process a transaction once in a blue moon to only collect their interest which is not a good method for making a payment system.\n\nTraders were therefore able to enter the BitBean currency with a minimal amount of funds and be able to “mint” several blocks a day, thereby increasing their holdings with little risk. Meanwhile Sha256 miners who were in the know were able to mine a lot of coins in a short period.\n\nThe Implementation\n\nBitBean was taken seriously by the larger community. It landed on Cryptsy on February 18th, to the surprise of everyone including the current development duo, Tom C. of Albany, NY and Shawn K. of New Hampshire. It also began being traded on another popular exchange for alt-coins, Bittrex. The proof-of-work phase had only lasted three days, after all, so anyone who wanted to get in on the ground floor had only the option of purchasing the coins on an exchange. The speculation on the exchanges increased the value greatly, as you can see from the below chart. It didn’t reach crazy great heights, though, which made what happened next strange.\n\nThe lead developer, no-name nokat, pushed an update, the primary purpose of which was to change the transaction fees. He made this change a bit suddenly, but that wasn’t the odd thing about it.\n\nThe odd thing about it was that it would have broken the block chain, had the other developers not caught it in time. 11,407,538 BITB were transferred out of wallet address 2W4bxGDNu5keLZxz1oNqEntHagbL3KkXNs just before the exchanges updated their wallets with the addresses. This ensured that no one else would be able to dump along with nokat.\n\nThe way this was accomplished was by setting a “checkpoint” in the source code of the update that was for a block that had already been passed. What this meant is that anyone who synced the block chain after that point would be going off on a fork. If it was a mistake, according to the developers, it was a very novice mistake, which led them to believe that it was intentional, especially when combined with the knowledge that nokat had dumped such a significant sum of Beans on the market already. (At the time of the dump, roughly 3.5 BTC worth.)\n\nShawn K. says, “Seems obvious to me he planned it. […] Based on what I can see, I find it too hard to believe that he didn’t know the passed checkpoint was going to fork the chain.” In the words of Tom C., who was designated as “community manager” from early in the coin’s development stages:\n\nI agree, considering the coding he had done before, he seemed perfectly capable to be able to push that update. Come on, a passed checkpoint?\n\nNokat sent a few last messages to Tom C., saying “I am a failure” and essentially giving up on the project. Interestingly, “failing” hadn’t stopped the anonymous developer from dumping in a sizable way.\n\nThe Rescue\n\nThe pair rescued the coin from the forked block chain, getting Cryptsy and Bittrex to roll back their wallets to the last known good code. The majority of the coin holders had not updated their wallets, so the actual fork damage appeared minimal. The new development team, while small, is working on implementing some important bug fixes and changes for the near future. When asked why they had wanted to take over, they said they didn’t want to see the same old scam happen.\n\nThey wanted to do something different, and bring BitBean back from life support to the thriving contender it had appeared to be early on. The ability to handle large numbers of transactions quickly is important to both of them, and their eventual goal is for brick-and-mortar stores to be using it in daily transactions, not unlike Bitcoin and others, but with the added benefit of encouraging merchants to hold their coins in order to quantify profit via staking.\n\nNew updates to the wallet are expected throughout the year. For a coin and community that have already been on such a roller coaster ? rollercoaster ride, the benefits of long-term holding will hopefully outweigh the risks.

With this, people will now be able to transfer and convert bitcoin to pesos and rupees without being affected by bitcoin exchange rate volatility. By adding Indian rupee and Mexican peso, Bitreserve has gained access to a huge chunk of low value- high volume international remittance stream originating from the low income Mexican and Indian emigrant workforce who send money back to their families on a regular basis.\n\nWith the addition of Bitrupee (BitINR) and Bitpeso (BitMXN), Bitreserve now supports eight different real-world currencies in addition to four precious metals and bitcoin. Bitpeso’s announcement coincides with the company’s partnership with Ricardo Salinas-Pliego, a Mexican billionaire and the largest investor in Bitreserve so far.\n\nHalsey Minor founded Bitreserve late last year with an aim of providing low cost, high-speed international transaction services to those in developing countries who do not have access to banking services. According to Minor, over 2.5 billion adults do not have access to even the basic financial services and only 41 percent of adults in developing countries have their own bank accounts. Bitreserve aims to provide affordable financial services to these people.\n\nBitreserve allows its users to deposit bitcoin into their account and convert it to its corresponding value in fiat currency, protecting them from any losses due to bitcoin price volatility. The user can then convert it back to bitcoin and instantaneously transfer it to anyone across the globe. Users can also spend it on their money cards at places that accept bitcoin. Bitreserve charges a one-time transaction fee of 0.45% when someone converts bitcoin to bitmoney (can be any supported currency) after which the customer can freely move their funds around.

Blockchain.', 'Editor’s note: Ron Klain, a former high-level White House aide in the Obama and Clinton administrations, is general counsel of Revolution LLC, a Washington-based investment firm.\n\nFor the past few years, the most visible friction between startups and regulatory agencies has been on the local level. Venture capital “unicorns” like Uber, Lyft and Airbnb have been battling municipal regulators and officials as they transform travel, transportation and other industries largely in the purview of local government. But this regulatory “fault line” is about to move. The most visible conflicts between startups and the government in the next two years will be in the nation’s capital, not in city halls or state houses.\n\nRecent developments in Washington, especially the Obama administration’s greater desire to flex its regulatory muscles in several key areas, mean that some booming startups will have to navigate new governmental hurdles in Washington ,D.C. Four areas stand out for particular attention in the next few months.\n\nDrones\n\nThe general population thinks of drones as weapons of war, or toys used by pesky neighbors for snooping, but the potential for a domestic drone industry – to revolutionize agriculture, industry, shipping, and commerce – is enormous. Other nations are moving quickly to capitalize on the promise of this new market, but regulators in the United States have been less friendly to commercial drone use.\n\nOn February 15, the administration proposed new rules to liberalize commercial drones, but they remain restrictive and fail to permit many innovative applications of drones (including drones piloted by remote cameras, a critical dimension to allowing drones to achieve early wins for users in agriculture and industry). As with many other technologies, if regulators limit their use in a country, innovators are likely to take their manufacturing facilities elsewhere.\n\nIn the months ahead, expect a contentious debate over the new FAA rules, as startups battle regulators over the acceptable contours for the use of this budding technology, and advocates complain of a loss of U.S. drone leadership to other nations.\n\nFinancial tech\n\nOne of the hottest venture-backed asset classes, the dizzying array of fintech firms offering new ways to provide equity or debt capital to businesses and consumers will see scrutiny from some of the most well-respected regulators in the Obama administration: Mary Jo White and her colleagues at the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Rich Cordray and his team at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\nAlready, the SEC has delayed rules for crowdfunding by more than two years due to investor protection concerns, creating tension in the startup community anxious to have access to this new source of capital. New disputes will center on lending and consumer financial products.\n\nIn late February, the president announced new rules to crack down on conflicts of interest in financial advice – startups and mobile apps providing such advice are an emerging fintech area. Moreover, with the CFPB coming after payday lending and prepaid credit cards, fintech firms that offer services similar to these may find themselves in the regulators’ focus before too long.\n\nMedical devices and genetic testing\n\nThese two areas ripe with startups have long complained about the length and difficulty of getting Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval to get to market. But this festering conflict is likely to grow even more acute with the departure of FDA Commissioner Peggy Hamburg from the agency last month. While Hamburg had her battles with startups – her conflict with genetic testing startup 23andMe caused a major rift between Silicon Valley and Washington – the absence of a confirmed leader for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the potential for a long and contentious process to replace Hamburg, will likely mean inaction at the agency and less progress toward innovative approaches.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have been signaling that they may propose legislation to speed up the FDA approval process, but whether such a bill can pass Congress is in doubt – and whether it would obtain the president’s signature is even more questionable.\n\nPrivacy and cybersecurity\n\nTo paraphrase an old saying, for a long time, privacy and cybersecurity have been like the humid summers in Washington: Everyone talks about it, but no one does anything about it. That is about to change.\n\nThe high-profile cyberattack on Sony, coupled with the repeated stories about consumer data breaches at major companies, has amped up concern at the White House and has led the administration to press Congress for action even more strongly than in the past. The president’s first ever Cybersecurity Summit in Silicon Valley this month was evidence of this, and more is likely to come.\n\nAny firm that takes this lightly will find itself on the wrong end of a sharp action by the administration – and if Congress does not pick up the pace, it too will pay a political price. For startups who have privacy and security solutions, the renewed interest in Washington, D.C., will be a good thing; for those who think they can just slide by, they will be held up to unpleasant scrutiny and consequences in the policy process.\n\nWith 20 months to go in President Obama’s term, look for the administration to increase its activity in these four areas and find more instances of both cooperation and conflict with the technology sector. The policy/tech fault line will be in Washington, D.C. – and it will offer more promise and peril than it has in a long time.\n\nNote: The views expressed here are those of the author.

03/23/2015,"['Major American stock exchange Nasdaq has announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with bitcoin startup Noble Markets.\n\nAs part of the deal, Noble will utilize Nasdaq’s X-stream technology upon its formal launch, joining the 30 global marketplace that currently use the multi-asset trading platform. Led by founder and CEO John Betts, Noble Markets boasts a team with experience at traditional financial giants such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and UBS.\n\nPerhaps best known in the bitcoin community as one of the investors and organisers behind the campaign SaveGox.com, Betts has also served as VP of strategy for Strevus, a regulatory compliance platform provider that added support for digital currency startups in 2014.\n\nBetts indicated that his latest venture seeks to leapfrog competitors in the market by providing many of the functionalities they may be seeking to build out of the box. For example, Betts went on to suggest that, as a marketplace, Noble won’t aim to compete against bitcoin exchanges, but instead seek to provide liquidity to these companies.\n\nBetts told CoinDesk:\n\n”We’re not trying to fight for a slice of the pie, we’re building the venue where the large capital that exists in the capital markets and corporations that use these products as part of their business needs, where we can provide that liquidity to other exchanges. The goal is to create a larger pie.”\n\nDescribing the product as a bridge between the traditional financial and bitcoin communities, Betts said that Noble aims to find ""the best of both worlds"" in terms of attracting these now disparate ecosystems.\n\nBetts suggested that Nasdaq, in turn, was eager to work with a partner in the bitcoin space and that they were an active player in helping to forge the relationship.\n\nSolving a business need\n\nKey to this goal of growing the size of the bitcoin market, Betts contends, will be services that utilize bitcoin but provide a more familiar experience to entrants from traditional financial backgrounds.\n\nEquipped with Nasdaq’s technology, Betts believes Noble will be best positioned to tackle this problem, given that it will use standard interfaces built on “20 years of intellectual property”.\n\n“They need counterparties that will provide the services they need to do business, and they have not had a counterparty that they’ve been able to trade bitcoin with,” Betts added.\n\nBetts went on to state that Noble has invested its own resources into building what he categorized as robust real-time risk management, consolidation and settlement capabilities.\n\nFurther, he suggested these tools would be necessary for any marketplace that wanted to convince larger players they could be responsible for customer assets.\n\nNasdaq embraces innovation\n\nIn statements, representatives of Nasdaq sought to portray the announcement as one that positions the more than 40-year-old company as supportive of “new and emerging technologies”.\n\nLars Ottersgård, Nasdaq’s executive vice president of market technology, said his company will continue to support the efforts of Noble as it explores the use of its technology in a new market.\n\n“We are thrilled to work with the experienced industry veterans at Noble Markets and look forward to supporting their cutting-edge, new endeavor for the long term in addressing the needs of the digital currency space,” Ottersgård said.\n\nBetts went on to say that, based on his personal experience, he believes major financial institutions are beginning to evolve their thinking about the larger bitcoin ecosystem to the point where they’re now eager to get involved with the technology.\n\nThough he believes bitcoin provides a number of inherent advantages, Betts suggested that benefits by themselves are not enough, concluding:\n\n""To be able to leverage that, there are other products and services they need, and that\'s part of the Noble Markets value proposition.""\n\nMarkets image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Each week, the digital currency achieves a major fundamental breakthrough, such as the last week’s announcement of the UK government to regulate the cryptocurrency in the wake of growing popularity and amid increasing demands of a cheap, reliable financial system which does not feature a third party.\n\nAs the ecosystem grows, it is expected that more investors will enter the Bitcoin markets and the number of Bitcoin trading exchanges will rise. Therefore, it becomes imperative that we discuss the differential pricing of Bitcoin across different exchanges.\n\nIn some instances, market participants have lost their investments because they placed their orders by mistakenly confusing the price of Bitcoin on a foreign exchange with their domestic prices. Sometimes, readers argue that a price in our analysis hasn’t been reached yet, but they fail to recognize the price differential that is maintained across exchanges.\n\nTo understand this completely, readers must check out OKCoin’s Market List here. This page features the latest quotes of Bitcoin across various exchanges. A snapshot of the latest prices has been presented below:\n\nAs can be seen, the BTC-e lists the lowest price at $267.59, while the Chinese exchange BTCC is quoting the highest price at $270.11. Another observation is that the price difference between BTC-e and other US exchanges such as OKCoin.com, BitStamp, BitFinex, and Coinbase ranges from 1 to 3 dollars. However, the Chinese exchanges such as BTC China (BTCC), HuoBi, and OKCoin.cn, all maintain a lead over their US counterparts in terms of pricing. This consideration is with regards to the spot pricings.\n\nIn order to consider the futures market, let us take OKCoin’s futures. OKCoin has an index for the futures market, which includes the prices of all major Bitcoin exchanges. Acknowledging that Chinese Bitcoin market is much bigger than US, the index gives more weightage to the Chinese exchanges. Hence, the price gravitates more towards the Bitcoin prices in China. The current index value is $269.02.\n\nConclusively, it is advised that investors and traders must pay strong attention to the prices on the exchange.

We are moving from dismissal to curiosity. Now it is our job to take it to the next level.”\n\nThe fintech-focussed startup incubator is powered by Techstars, which was founded in 2006 and is backed by over 75 VC firms.\n\nStartups from more than 60 countries applied to be part of the program, but only 10 were selected.\n\nSchuill said Barclays was “heavily involved” in the selection process, with the final round comprising a question-and-answer session with 20-30 members of the Barclays team.\n\nIntensive schedule\n\nThe chosen companies will receive $20,000 seed funding from Techstars and will also benefit from an intensive schedule of networking, mentoring and development.\n\nThose behind Atlas Card are no strangers to this type of environment, having taken part in Tribe 4\'s tenure in Boost VC’s startup accelerator.\n\nAtlas Card has something of an interesting set of founders, including James Schuler, who is an Olympic qualifier in pole-vaulting, Thiel Fellow and Y combinator graduate.\n\nSimon Edhouse, co-founder and director of strategy at Blocktrace, explained his company hopes to assist in minimising jewellery-related insurance fraud.

The currency, originally slated for release in January last year, was shuttered after the Kanye West decided it was a copyright infringement to have his face on the promotional material surrounding Coinye West’s launch.\n\nThis year however, the crown for digital currency novelty could go to a development studio based in Austin, Texas for its FitCoin app. While most other cryptocurrencies require some sort of ‘mining’ to generate the currency, FitCoin relies on fitness tracking.\n\nChaotic Moon Studios built the app to work with wearable devices, such as Mio, Atlas and the Jawbone 3. The Mio and Atlas are currently ‘wearable’ with the app. The Jawbone 3 is imminent.\n\n“This concept combines two of our specialties: looking good and making money,” said Chaotic Moon boss, Ben Lamm at the product’s launch at SXSW.\n\nAs the user exercises, the fitness tracker sends data such as heart rate and length of activity to the app, which then applies an algorithm to convert the effort you’ve put in with how much computer processing time your device shall spend mining currency.\n\nIn a demonstration, Grant Nicol, a designer on FitCoin wore a Mio band and ran on a treadmill for 40 seconds – and his smartphone mined nearly five cents.\n\nSounds great. But don’t expect to become rich off it. It’s more pocket money standards than anything else. Chaotic Moon hopes that with a few tweaks, the technology could help deliver lower health insurance rates for those who continue to stay more active. Another use is to generate enough money for to buy merchandise from sports organisations – if they choose to get on board with the concept.\n\nWhile the technology is barely out of a development phase, FitCoin does mark a moment when cryptocurrencies appear to be moving out of the shadows and into the mainstream.\n\nLast week, Intel announced its interest in exploring blockchain technology – that underpins cryptocurrencies. In the beginning of September 2014 the Bank of England published a report that describes blockchain as a, “significant innovation’ that has ‘far-reaching implications”.\n\nKarma, another cryptocurrency, issues digital money based upon people’s good deeds. IBM and Samsung have also entered the space, but with the idea of using blockchain technology to explore how to make a decentralised Internet of Things.\n\nSo while wearing a running shoe to earn Bitcoins might be a bit of a gimmick, the level of innovation, and the ensuing applications that emerge as a result, could be game changing.\n\nRead Next: Why BitCoin is changing how banks do business\n\nRead next: Netflix confirms pricing for Australia and New Zealand after its launch catalogue leaks', 'CEX.IO is offering 0% trading fees for a short period of time as it renews its focus on the bitcoin exchange space, following the suspension of its GHash.io cloud mining contracts earlier this year.\n\nThe exchange, which currently charges a fixed 0.2% commission fee on all buy/sell transactions will cancel its trading fees for a one-week period, starting on 25th March.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Helga Danova, communications officer at CEX.IO, said:\n\n""To make new features available for as many people as possible, we have opened up our service and invite people to try out trading on CEX.IO with 0% fees.""\n\nThe free trading will cease on 1st April.\n\nHeightened security\n\nThe move comes amid a series of company-wide improvements, including measures aimed at heightening security.\n\nCEX.IO obtained a Level 3 PCI DSS certificate, according to Danova. The certificate is issued to help businesses process card payments securely and reduce fraud. To get the certificate, companies must introduce tight controls surrounding the storage, transmission and processing of cardholders\' data.\n\nCoinDesk contacted the PCI Security Standards Council for verification, but the organisation had not replied at the time of press.\n\nDanova commented on the exchange\'s security priorities:\n\n""As we are approaching 400,000 users, it is our priority to make the exchange more secure and easy-to-use, launching new features and opening the world of bitcoin to newcomers in the crypto field.""\n\nThese attempts to enhance security come a couple of months after GHash.io was targeted, along with a number of bitcoin mining pools, by distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks.\n\nAt the time, CEX.io (which operated GHash.io) said the source of recent attacks on its pool came with increasing ransom demands.\n\nMining troubles\n\nThe exchange halted its cloud mining activities in January, with the company claiming that mining was no longer profitable and blaming declining revenue on bitcoin\'s decreasing price.\n\nPrior to that, a number of miners opted to leave GHash.io\'s pool following a significant increase in its hash share. The mass-departure was based on the belief that a single entity controlling more than 50% of the network\'s computing power, could theoretically wreak havoc on the whole network.\n\nIndustrial bitcoin mining facility operator BitFury moved 1.5 petahash of its hashing power out of GHash\'s mining pool in June last year. At the time, Marc Aafjes, BitFury’s chief strategy and communications officer, suggested the company felt compelled to take action due to the widespread community concern, stating that ""the high level of combined hash power in the Ghash pool is concerning to many participants in the system"".\n\nAs a result of the controversy, GHash.io later agreed to limit its share of the total bitcoin network to 39.99% to avoid the associated threat of 51% attacks.\n\nThe decision was taken during the Bitcoin Mining Summit in July last year.

If you make a deposit in bitcoin to Bitreserve, you don’t have to worry about volatility, because your bitcoin can be converted to dollars on-the-fly and appear as dollars in your balance. So Bitreserve users don’t lose money if the exchange rate of bitcoin goes down – if they have chosen to convert part of their holdings to, say, $1,000 USD, they will continue to have $1,000 USD in their account regardless of any fluctuations of bitcoin value.\n\nOf course, the reverse is also true: if the exchange rate of bitcoin goes up, you don’t make money. But today risk-averse bitcoin users are scared of volatility and many fear that bitcoin will continue to dive as it has done in 2014. In the harsh reality of today’s economy, most individuals and small businesses must carefully manage their finances, and are unable to tolerate even a small degree of volatility.\n\n“Bitreserve is on a mission to democratize the use of digital currency by protecting businesses and consumers from the risks inherent in the bitcoin model,” notes a Forbes review quoted on the Bitreserve website.\n\nBitreserve users can fund their accounts with bitcoin, and can choose to hold their funds as bitcoin or “bitcurrencies” permanently pegged to gold or to a growing list of fiat currencies, including dollars, euros, pounds, yen, and yuan. Users who choose to convert their bitcoin are still able to send bitcoin payments to other Bitreserve users or external bitcoin addresses, but their bitcoin holdings fluctuate with exchange rates, whereas their converted holdings stay stable.\n\nRecently Bitreserve announced the launch of two new bitcurrencies: the bitrupee (BitINR) and bitpeso (BitMXN), pegged to two key developing world currencies – the Indian rupia and the Mexican peso – now supported by Bitreserve’s cloud money system. Mexican Bitreserve customers will be able to hold their funds in Mexican pesos.\n\nThe most interesting part of the Bitreserve announcement is:\n\n“The bitpeso is key to realizing the potential of our partnership with Bitreserve’s largest investor, Ricardo Salinas-Pliego, one of Mexico’s most admired entrepreneurs and the Chairman and CEO of Grupo Salinas, one of Latin America’s largest and fastest-growing business groups.”\n\nSalinas-Pliego is the fourth richest person in Mexico behind Carlos Slim and the 168th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US $8 billion in March 2015.\n\nGrupo Salinas, a group of companies with interests in telecommunications, media, financial services, and retail stores, is a pioneer in bringing basic financial services to the poor and working class through its retail and banking arm Grupo Elektra. According to the official website, Grupo Elektra, Latin America’s leading financial services company, is “focused on the base of the pyramid” – the large mass of Latin American financially disadvantaged citizens and migrant workers in the US. The Bitreserve announcement notes that:\n\n“With over 2,600 retail outlets and bank branches throughout Latin America, Grupo Salinas will be a key partner in bringing the benefits of Bitreserve’s cloud money system to millions of Mexicans working in the US and hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses throughout Latin America.”\n\nThe wording of the announcement and the business model of Grupo Elektra imply that Bitreserve wants to grab a slice of the large market for remittances sent from migrant Mexican workers in the US back to their families in Mexico, in partnership with a major financial services company and community bank. The plan combines the faster and cheaper remittances permitted by Bitcoin with the convenience of using the national currency.\n\nThe announcement also reveals that Salinas-Pliego is now the main investor in Bitreserve, but the amount of his investment hasn’t been disclosed.', 'Antiwar.com, an alternative media organization that has been covering war crimes and American interventionism for over a decade, was recently dropped by Google adsense. The context advertising service claims Antiwar.com has displayed content that was ""too gory.""\n\nGoogle has drawn a rather crooked line on the sand this March 18 by dropping Antiwar’s adsense support in reference to images of Abu Ghraib detainees being abused by US troops in Iraq, dating back to 2006.\n\nAfter the word got out and Gawker reported on it, Google seemed to back down, contacting Antiwar.com and reassuring them adsense would be restored. The next day however, they received another message from the adsense team, asking them to remove this article, which contains images of dead soldiers killed by the Ukrainian Government last year.\n\nGoogle’s policies dictate that publishers are not to advertise on “content that contains graphic or gory images such as bloodshed, fight scenes, and gruesome or freak accidents,” subtly leaving out war as one of the examples. Where the line begins to get crooked is in their consistent application of this policy, or the apparent the lack thereof.\n\nEric Garris, founder of Antiwar.com wrote in regards to Google’s Abu Ghraib page take down request:\n\n“This page has been up for 11 years. During all that time Google Adsense has been running ads on our site – but as Washington gets ready to re-invade Iraq, and in bombing, killing, and abusing more civilians, they suddenly decide that their ;anti-violence’ policy, which prohibits ‘disturbing material,’ prohibits any depiction of violence committed by the U.S. government and paid for with your tax dollars. [The Abu Ghraib page] is the third-most-visited page in our history, getting over 2 million page views since it was posted.”\n\nAdding to the case made by Garris, multiple other news sites have reported on the Ukrainian killings and posted the same images shown on their article, meanwhile their adsense is yet to be dropped. Some examples are the Dailymail and Ktar, among others.\n\nThough Google adsense certainly has the right to chose who uses their adsense services - as any libertarian would argue - it is also plausible that by withdrawing their support of sites containing images of war, they are making it more difficult for journalists to fund their research, consequentially enabling the war machine through silence.\n\nOr perhaps it is a freak coincidence that the Google block dice rolled over Antiwar.\n\nEither way, after the second take down request was submitted, Garris declared “We have no intention of letting Google dictate our editorial policies,” soon after making a call out to advertisers who want to take Google’s place, as well as for donations to help ease the loss of revenue.\n\nDo they accept bitcoin? Of course!\n\nAs Operations Developer Angela Keaton put it early last year “Bitcoin transactions are inherently pro-peace,” referring to decentralized money’s potential to replace fiat currencies and central banks, who routinely create new units out of thin air to fund the war machine, among other things.\n\nAntiwar has been accepting bitcoin since 2012 and could use your help right now. Here’s their donation page.\n\nYou can also put some pressure on Google if you wish, Antiwar suggests that you “Contact Google ads and give them a piece of your mind. Tell them that you don’t appreciate their efforts on behalf of the Washington censors and demand that they reinstate us immediately.”\n\nGoogle Inc.\n\n1600 Amphitheater Parkway\n\nMountain View, CA 94043\n\nTelephone: 650-253-0000\n\nYou can also interact with Google at their forum.\n\nYou can confirm Antiwar has been blocked at Adsenseblockchecker.\n\nHere is Antiwar’s full post about the event.\n\nHow to dodge Google’s omnipresence\n\nLast but not least, out of outrage with Google’s actions were born various comments on Antiwar’s blog post on how to avoid Google’s services. Here are some suggestions, which are almost as good while protecting your privacy.\n\nStartpage is a search engine that claims to use the same database as google, while encrypting your traffic and searches, which reveal a shocking amount about your thoughts, deepest interests and concerns. For a taste, check out this leaked data base of searches on AOL -back in the day-, which is searchable per user.\n\nAs far as a replacement for Google docs and Google drive, to my knowledge we don’t have a privacy focused alternative yet, though Kim Dotcom’s Mega seems to be working on it and they already offer encrypted cloud storage with 50gbs for free!\n\nAs far as email replacements with peer to peer encryption, Protonmail and Tutatona seem to be worthy alternatives.\n\nWhat about social media? Well, if you even use Google plus, than maybe you would be interested in Synereo, the privacy centric “decentralized social media” platform that launched their crowdfunding on March 23rd. Also... #DumpFacebook.\n\nPerhaps this will be a catalyst to changing the way we think about the internet. If Google is going to boycott anti-war efforts, than I say we #boycottGoogle, as well as any other arm of the NSA while we are at it.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

03/24/2015,"['Bitcoin is getting some help from a major financial player: Nasdaq.\n\nNasdaq has signed on to provide trading technology for a startup, Noble Markets, that is looking to build a marketplace for buying and selling bitcoin and other digital currency, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nFrom the Journal:\n\nThe agreement follows other Wall Street initiatives that could pave the way for financial institutions to own and trade digital currencies, which fans say have the potential to make the global financial system more efficient but which have also been marred by price fluctuations, investment scams and cybersecurity concerns.\n\nThe story also notes that a number of other financial power players have recently made moves to support Bitcoin: the New York Stock Exchange invested in Coinbase; regulators have approved public trading on the Digital Currency Group’s Bitcoin Investment Trust; former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. executive Blythe Masters became CEO of a new digital-asset settlement service; and news broke on Monday that former NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer will work as an adviser to bitcoin derivatives platform TeraExchange.\n\nBitcoin has skyrocketed to national attention over the past few years as the leading player in the emerging digital currency space. The exchange rate is highly volatile, but as of Monday afternoon, one Bitcoin was equal to $267.61. Bitcoin earned a bad reputation early on for being a favored currency of those looking to buy and sell illegal goods online, but as the Nasdaq deal highlights, it’s become increasingly accepted as a legitimate financial product.\n\nFor more on recent bitcoin news, see: Why March 10 was a big day for bitcoin\n\nWatch more business news from Fortune:', ""Dutch bitcoin and altcoin brokerage Anycoin Direct expands its instant buying and selling service to an additional fourteen – predominantly Eastern European – countries. The move is the result of a new partnership by Anycoin Direct with the European payment institution TrustPay.\n\nPrior to the TrustPay partnership, Anycoin Direct did already buy and sell bitcoins in Eastern Europe using the European payment-integration initiative SEPA. With SEPA, however, the purchase of cryptocurrency is not instant, meaning that many of Anycoin Direct’s customers had to wait a day until the bitcoins or altcoins were sent to their address.\n\nNow, with the new TrustPay partnership, Anycoin Direct's instant service - which sends bitcoins and altcoins to customers within minutes after payment - is not limited to Western Europe, but also available in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Turkey.\n\nAnycoin Direct co-founder Lennert Vlemmings suspects that their instant service buying and selling service is a first of its kind in many of these newly added countries. Speaking to CoinTelegraph, Vlemmings said:\n\n“By adding TrustPay it is now possible to buy bitcoins instantly in countries where this was not possible before. This brings us one step closer to our goal; making bitcoin instantly available for everyone.”\n\nAs opposed to exchanges, buyers and sellers of bitcoins and altcoins are not matched to each other through Anycoin Direct, but instead buy and sell their cryptocurrency directly to and from the company. Anycoin Direct, in turn, buys and sells these bitcoins and altcoins at different exchanges, always looking for the best deal to which it adds a 1% fee for customers.\n\nBy using a number of European payment processors, Anycoin Direct seeks to lower the barrier of entry for its customers, who for smaller amounts don't need to go through a thorough verification process.\n\nAnycoin Direct was founded by Vlemmings and Bram Ceelen as Bitplaats (“Bitplace”) in April of 2013. While the company initially focused its efforts on the Dutch bitcoin market, it expanded its reach to Belgium in the first week of 2014, and then changed its name and added instant buying options for most of Western Europe later that year. Subsequently, Anycoin Direct had an impressive start of 2015, with €500k funding by a private investor and an expansion of its services to Canada .\n\nApart from bitcoin, Anycoin Direct buys and sells blackcoin, dogecoin, darkcoin, feathercoin, litecoin, namecoin, peercoin en zetacoin.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Before joining NYSE in 2007, Niederauer was managing director and co-head of the Equities Division Execution Services franchise at Goldman Sachs.\n\n“This is an excellent opportunity to contribute to the growing Tera footprint. They are a young derivatives exchange with a great management team and a strong product and sales pipeline,” said Niederauer. “I have already begun advising them on how to approach and capture the opportunities that are emerging in the rapidly evolving global financial landscape for traditional and emerging financial products, such as bitcoin.”\n\n“We’re delighted that Duncan has chosen to join Tera at this exciting time for our business,” said Christian Martin, chairman and CEO of Tera. “Our firm operates with the same client-first approach Duncan has shown throughout his impressive career. By providing the management team and clients with his unique global perspective, he will greatly add to the knowledge and experience of our firm.”\n\nBitcoin derivatives such as Tera’s forwards are the simplest way to expose investors to Bitcoin, especially those investors who prefer not to trade the digital currency itself – and are the easiest way to profit from the ups and downs of the bitcoin-dollar exchange rate. That’s why the Bitcoin derivatives market is exploding worldwide.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, former Goldman Sachs Executive Director Timo Schlaefer recently announced the launch of Bitcoin derivatives broker Crypto Facilities, which confirms the growing interest of institutional investors in the Bitcoin economy.\n\nNYSE itself is warming up to Bitcoin: In January, in a joint investment with the participation of a subsidiary of USAA and BBVA Ventures, NYSE invested $75 million in the Bitcoin service provider Coinbase, bringing its total capital to $106 million.\n\nNasdaq, the second U.S. stock exchange, announced that Noble Markets will implement Nasdaq’s X-stream trading technology for the company’s soon to be launched digital currency marketplace.\n\n“As one of the world’s leading providers of technology to the capital markets, Nasdaq is dedicated to discovering and supporting new and emerging technologies and marketplaces,” said Nasdaq Executive VP Lars Ottersgård. “We are thrilled to work with the experienced industry veterans at Noble Markets and look forward to supporting their cutting-edge, new endeavor for the long-term in addressing the needs of the digital currency space.”\n\n“Noble was founded on the principal of bringing credible market structure and institutional trading expertise to the cryptocurrency marketplace,” added John Betts, founder and CEO of Noble Markets. “We are excited that Nasdaq shares our vision and commitment to support the development of this ground-breaking market.”\n\nBefore founding Noble Markets, which is backed by venture-capital firms Blockchain Capital of San Francisco and Tally Capital of Chicago, Betts led the development of electronic trading platforms at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal notes that the agreement follows other Wall Street initiatives, such as the appointment of Niederauer at NYSE, which could pave the way for financial institutions to own and trade digital currencies.\n\nNew sophisticated trading infrastructures could instill more confidence in Bitcoin, despite the negative headlines focused on illicit activities, scams and extreme volatility, and attract hedge funds and other institutional investors that could bring stability to the cryptocurrency.\n\nMajor financial players are warming to the idea that the technology behind Bitcoin, if not the currency itself, could slash costs from the global financial system.\n\nNiederauer Photo by Friends of Europe / CC BY 2.0; NYSEPhoto by Vincent Desjardins / CC BY 2.0', 'Bitcoin Savings & Trust (BS&T) operator Trendon Shavers has plead not guilty to fraud charges in a New York District court.\n\nIf convicted, Shavers faces up to 40 years in prison, as well as millions of dollars in potential fines and penalties. Shavers is charged with one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud.\n\nThe prosecution alleges that Shavers promised outsized returns to investors but in reality operated a Ponzi scheme by paying early investors with the proceeds from new ones. Shavers, who operated under the username pirateat40, solicited investors for BS&T during 2011 and 2012.\n\nShavers was found guilty of securities violations in September and was ordered to pay $40m in fines following the conclusion of a trial that began last July.\n\nHe was then arrested in November in connection with charges filed by the US Attorney’s Office in Manhattan. Shavers was taken into custody on 6th November and released on bail that same day.\n\nThe indictment stated that many of those who Shavers solicited ultimately lost their money, noting:\n\n“In the end, at least 48 of approximately 100 investors lost all or part of their investment in BS&T. At the peak of his scheme, Shavers raised and had in his possession about 7% of the bitcoin that was in public circulation at the time.”\n\nThe court hearing, held 23rd March, was presided by District Judge Lewis Kaplan.\n\nPonzi scheme outlined\n\nA court filing dated 15th March outlines the US Attorney’s Office case against Shavers, who raised more than 764,000 BTC ($188m at press time) from investors during the now-defunct BS&T operating period.\n\nShavers used both online mediums as well as in-person events to solicit investors. According to the indictment, Shaver misled investors by stating that hedge funds were involved with the company and that it was not a Ponzi scheme.\n\nIt was during this time that Shavers allegedly took client funds for personal use, including thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins to trade with on the Japan-based Mt Gox bitcoin exchange and later filter into a personal bank account and money account via the payment processor Dwolla.\n\nThe court filing reads:\n\n“Specifically, Shavers transferred about 150,649 bitcoin to an account in Shavers’ name at Mt Gox (the “Shavers Mt Gox Account”).

Antonopoulos wrote the 298-page book Mastering Bitcoin (O’Reilly Media) with computer programmers in mind.\n\n“When I was on the early Internet, it was relatively difficult to use and kludgy, and there were no graphical user interfaces,” Antonopoulos told the Georgia Straight during a Skype video call from the northeastern United States. “It was all command line. That doesn’t mean I didn’t think mainstream adoption was coming for the Internet. I just could recognize that my mom wasn’t going to use that Internet, and it took 20 years before the Internet was where my mom could use it on an iPad with a finger-swipe instead of the way I used it.”\n\nAn outspoken technologist and entrepreneur, Antonopoulos is one of the most prominent figures in the Bitcoin world. Indeed, when he addressed Canada’s standing Senate committee on banking, trade, and commerce in October 2014, chair Irving Gerstein introduced him as “the bitcoin guru” who has “literally written the book on bitcoin”.\n\nAntonopoulos told the committee, which is studying the use of digital currency, that Bitcoin combines security and decentralization, is “regulated by mathematical algorithm”, and, contrary to popular belief, doesn’t confer anonymity on users. He urged the Canadian government to give Bitcoin “time to breathe” and not introduce regulations that would hamper the growth of the technology in its early stages.\n\n“The banks brought you the great recession and global recession of 2008, and geeks gave you the Internet,” Antonopoulos told the Straight five months after his trip to Ottawa. “Who are you going to let write the rules? How’s that for a slogan?”\n\nMastering Bitcoin features 10 chapters—covering such topics as Bitcoin mining, security, transactions, and wallets; the blockchain; and altcoins and metacoins—and, thankfully, a brief glossary. In the preface, Antonopoulos recalls that, when he first came across Bitcoin in 2011, he dismissed it as “nerd money”, though he eventually came to see this “decentralized trust network” as the most exciting technology that’s been invented since the Internet.\n\nAnswering the question “What is Bitcoin?”, Antonopoulos writes: “Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem. Units of currency called bitcoins are used to store and transmit value among participants in the bitcoin network.”\n\nMastering Bitcoin covers mining, security, transactions, wallets, and more. Courtesy O’Reilly Media\n\nWhile Bitcoin is widely seen as just a currency, Antonopoulos asserted that this is a “fundamental mistake” because it’s also a technology platform.\n\n“Bitcoin is the Internet of money, and currency is just the first application,” he said. “The applications are really endless. We’re redefining money, redefining payment networks, creating possibilities for software-based payment systems that have never existed before.”\n\nAccording to Antonopoulos, Bitcoin has the potential to offer cheap mobile banking solutions to billions of “unbanked and underbanked” people around the world, and to reduce the high fees paid by immigrants and foreign workers sending remittances to their families in other countries. He highlighted multi-signature transactions and hierarchical deterministic wallets as the biggest recent developments in the Bitcoin space.\n\n(In Mastering Bitcoin, Antonopoulos points out that parties storing large amounts of bitcoin should consider using multi-signature addresses, because these typically require the authorization of multiple parties to spend their funds. Meanwhile, the hierarchical deterministic wallet represents a significant advancement in the software used to manage Bitcoin addresses.)\n\nAntonopoulos believes that Bitcoin will lead to the decentralization of many activities that currently rely on centralized institutions acting as “trusted points of control”. Indeed, in The Age of Cryptocurrency (St. Martin’s Press), Wall Street Journal writers Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey note that some Bitcoin enthusiasts see the potential for the technology to revolutionize online voting.\n\nHowever, Antonopoulos suggested that this is more likely to happen with shareholder votes than with democratic elections.\n\n“I don’t believe in online, electronic, or machine-assisted voting,” Antonopoulos said. “I think the most proven, most reliable, most fraud-proof, most auditable, and most fair voting system that exists on this Earth is paper and pencil.”\n\nA coffee shop in Vancouver promotes its acceptance of bitcoin. Stephen Hui\n\nAs of March 23, one bitcoin was valued at around US$266. On that day, the almost 14 million bitcoins in existence were collectively worth about US$3.7 billion.\n\nBitcoin is used as a speculative instrument by some investors, and the small market results in a volatile currency, according to Antonopoulos. He maintained that the price of bitcoin shouldn’t be used to judge whether the technology is a success or a failure.\n\nAntonopoulos noted that 2014—during which the price plunged almost 60 percent—has been called a terrible year for Bitcoin. Nevertheless, he insisted that it was Bitcoin’s best year yet, based on technological advances and venture-capital investment.\n\n“Do you judge the Internet by the average price of a DSL connection or the stock price of Yahoo, or do you judge the Internet by the number of services, applications, companies, and innovations it’s bringing to people around the world?” Antonopoulos asked. “I think the difference is that the Internet didn’t have a stock price for the entire industry when it was created.”', ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article."", 'Another altcoin exchange has been hacked, not even a month after AllCrypt went down. Cryptoine, which offers a number of markets not available at larger exchanges, is down as of this morning, claiming a hack. The operators have promised to be forthcoming with details at an unspecified time and date.\n\nRace Condition Bug\n\nAs you can see, the exchange is claiming that the exploit happened as a result of a “race condition bug,” which, in programming terms, means that uncontrollable events do not happen in the order the programmer intended. In a PHP program, this can often mean a bug in the way that time-of-use and time-of-check are implemented. The attacker was apparently able to exploit mistakes of the exchange’s programming team.\n\nNo Theft Yet Reported\n\nAs yet, no theft has been reported, but the exchange is unavailable at the time of writing. Unlike the AllCrypt hack, which was supposedly executed due to weaknesses in the WordPress platform, this exploit happened to custom-built software.\n\nMulti-Signature Withdrawals More Necessary Than Ever\n\nThis attack, along with other recent attacks such as the one on the Chinese exchange Bter, co-incides with wide-ranging calls in the community for broader implementation of multi-signature security. There is a lot of suspicion that exchanges are not implementing such because in most cases these supposed “hacks” are in fact inside jobs not unlike Ponzi schemes where the owners make off with the funds once there is a sufficient amount.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The bitcoin exchange that Coinbase launched in January, for trading the controversial digital currency, had great expectations on its shoulders.\n\n“It’s certainly a breakthrough for the space as a whole,” said bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver when news broke that the New York Stock Exchange was one of Coinbase’s backers. (The company’s nearly $107 million in venture capital is second only to the $116 million raised by secretive startup 21.) “The Coinbase exchange brings a new level to the bitcoin world,” said Daniel Palacio, founder of Authy.\n\nBut there are even greater expectations for all the exchanges that will come next.\n\nBitcoin exchanges already exist, such as Bitstamp—which has reopened after falling victim to a hack in January—Bitfinex, and BTCChina. TeraExchange, launched last October, allows for bitcoin derivatives trading. But Coinbase’s exchange was hyped as the country’s first “regulated” bitcoin exchange. (There has been dispute over this label. Coinbase is not yet officially licensed in New York, for example, where the state’s Department of Financial Services has come up with BitLicense, a set of regulations for digital currency companies.)\n\nNow there is widespread excitement over additional regulated exchanges to come, as well as over regulation in general. Last year, the IRS released regulatory guidelines over bitcoin and taxes, and just this month the U.K. Treasury came out with a report about the need to regulate bitcoin, and stating its plan to apply anti-money laundering rules to bitcoin exchanges. “We saw a lot of regulation last year,” says Authy’s Palacio. “I think we can see that it’s here to stay. It’s no longer a couple of techies using it.”\n\nThe great irony of excitement over regulation is that many of bitcoin’s biggest supporters got involved with bitcoin specifically because of its lack of regulation. “We can divide bitcoin people into two camps,” says Melanie Swan, author of the book Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy. “One that goes along with the existing system, and wants it to work complimentarily with the existing system, and then the other half is basically religiously opposed and wants to invent a libertarian, regulation-free world.”\n\nVer, who has been called the “Bitcoin Jesus,” is among the latter camp. “You can look all over the world, the places where the government has the least control have the highest standard of living,” he told Fortune. “Bernie Madoff, he was regulated up and down and every which way, and it didn’t do any good, he ran away with everyone’s money. It’s great what Coinbase is doing, but it’s frustrating because without all the regulations, we could do so much more already. And the Coinbase exchange is only a breakthrough for half of the people in the U.S.”\n\nIndeed, the Coinbase exchange is currently operational in only 26 states. But Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins of Facebook-related fame, are working on their own regulated exchange, called Gemini (the reference is clear), that they ambitiously liken to “a Nasdaq for bitcoin.”\n\nTyler Winklevoss predicts that 2015 is “the infrastructure year” for bitcoin in the U.S., and that establishing regulated exchanges is crucial to that infrastructure. But there needs to be more than one. “I think competition makes everyone better,” he says. “I’m not sure there is such a thing as one authoritative exchange. I guess we’ll see, but [the Coinbase launch] doesn’t change how we see ours.”\n\nIn contrast to Coinbase, which is operating in some states without a license, The Winklevosses are waiting to launch Gemini until it has full licensing, including in New York. Money on the exchange will be FDIC-insured, and the day-to-day trading price on Gemini will be used to price the duo’s separate exchange-traded fund they have planned, “if all goes well.” (Obtaining the licenses for a bitcoin ETF will be a thornier task, and the Winklevosses are competing with Barry Silbert, whose rival fund, the Bitcoin Investment Trust, got FINRA approval earlier this month.)\n\nBitcoin believers see potential in regulated exchanges to become important to mainstream market investors. “As a portfolio manager, when do you start advising to your clients that they have some cryptocurrency exposure?” asks Swan. “When will there be an index fund, a mutual fund of cryptocurrencies? It will happen.” Brian Kelly, author of The Bitcoin Big Bang, goes even further: “Is Gemini going to be the Charles Schwab for digital currencies? I don’t know, but that’s how I might think of it.”\n\nMight those who are fanatical about bitcoin for philosophical reasons exit the space once widespread regulation arrives? If not, then expect to see a major shift in attitudes among that camp. They loved bitcoin for the anti-government freedom it represented. If the exciting activity in the space is eventually happening on regulated exchanges, they may flock to other fledgling digital currencies.\n\nWatch more business news from Fortune:', '“We don\'t plan to close.”\n\nSuch is the resolve of BTC-e, the largest exchange for the Russian ruble, heading into spring 2015. The informal date has been on the minds of many in the bitcoin community since it was first billed as when Russia would ban bitcoin in August of last year.\n\nThe most recent comments suggesting this probable future were issued by deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev on 20th March. In new statements, the official in charge of coordinating Russia’s financial policy doubled down on his past terse dialogue toward cryptocurrencies, stating that the action will take place as previously announced.\n\nWhile the rhetoric may suggest a battle between two staunchly opposed sides, interviews with domestic entrepreneurs indicate that Russia’s apparent anti-bitcoin stance has already done much to drive away any interest in the market.\n\nInterviews with native or expatriate entrepreneurs suggest the evolution of Russia’s bitcoin market continues to attract more attention from media abroad than from those who would be positioned to serve its consumers.\n\nThe story of ALFAcoins CEO Vladimir Chelpanov, is indicative of the general narrative – the startup, which at first attempted to build a Russian alternative to BitPay, now doesn’t monitor the regulatory situation in Russia at all.\n\n“At the moment, our business model excludes the Russian market,” Chelpanov told CoinDesk.\n\nChelpanov, however, is by no means alone. Regardless of the final decision, statements suggest Russia may already have done enough to halt its market growth.\n\nMarket spike\n\nThe statements of current and former Russian entrepreneurs stand in contrast to English-language headlines that suggest bitcoin has become an attractive option for Russian investors given the recent struggles of the ruble.\n\nAnton Vereshchagin, founder of 247exchange, began positioning his bitcoin brokerage business toward the international market last year, and has since added a number of support services. The startup now boasts roughly 7,000 users.\n\nStill, Vereshchagin took little interest in Russia\'s perceived market activity, suggesting it was more of a byproduct of how difficult it was to secure US dollars given that many foreign exchange brokers had ceased operations.\n\n“People are scared that ruble will continue falling (especially the ones who had RUR balances at BTC-e), and are trying to buy bitcoins hoping that value of their savings will not decrease so much,” he said at the time.\n\nOther market observers like Tuur Demester saw the situation differently, suggesting wealthy Russians may begin opening accounts with bitcoin exchanges to move out of the ruble.\n\nRegardless of what might have been the behavior of Russian consumers at that time, data from Bitcoinity shows BTC/RUR trade volumes have once again settled on BTC-e, and it seems the spike in market activity did little to drive business interest.\n\nIndacoin’s big decision\n\nBitcoin exchange Indacoin remains one of the few industry startups both openly serving the Russian market and basing its operations domestically, a decision that is currently weighing on the company\'s top executive.\n\nCEO Stanislav Kosorukov told CoinDesk that he is watching regulatory developments in Russia closely as he considers relocating his eight-person team. He cited the cost of doing so as a factor to consider.\n\n“We’re thinking about that and now we’re waiting,” Kosorukov said, adding that he expects to make a final decision in the spring, when the company’s financial picture is clearer.\n\nThe threat of action has still hindered the company, however, as Indacoin was previously dropped by Qiwi wallet, a Russian payments service partner that has since cut ties with the country\'s emerging bitcoin industry.\n\nCurrently, Kosorukov said the company’s main goal is to focus on its ability to offer credit and debit card services and margin trading as the exchanges differentiators. Indacoin estimates that 15% of its volume is from Russia, but he says there are few reasons to expect any growth.\n\n“The community here is not so big and it would take us too much effort,” Kosorukov said.\n\nInternational focus\n\nMost startups with ties to the market now stress that their goal is to serve international customers broadly.\n\nBoaz Bechar, CEO of block explorer BlockTrail, for example, is keen to stress that, despite the fact that one of its founders started Russia’s largest social network, the company doesn\'t need similar success in this market.\n\n“While our co-founder and investor is of Russian background, Russia has never been a target market for us, both because of the regulatory environment, but primarily because we are aiming to create a global platform and not a localized service,” Bechar said.\n\nHe added that should the regulatory environment change, however, BlockTrail would consider engaging with consumers in the region, a statement echoed by many local market participants.\n\n“BlockTrail will remain unaffected and indifferent on any decisions Russia wishes to make regarding bitcoin,” Bechar continued.\n\nThe boldest respondent may be BTC-e, which has suggested it will continue its activity in the RUR markets regardless of any actions by regulators or third-party partners that help it facilitate such trading.\n\nBTC-e\'s statements suggest that Russia’s budding bitcoin community may continue to be served, even if monetary penalties are passed against its use.\n\n“We don’t live in Russia,"" the exchange representative said.\n\nSquare of Justice via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

03/25/2015,"['Nasdaq’s bitcoin deal could be a cryptocurrency Trojan horse\n\nThe UpTake: The highest levels of global financial institutions are adopting bitcoin, and not everyone will be happy about that.', 'LEOcoin is a good example of what a pump & dump coin looks like, user beware.\n\nLEOcoin was ‘launched’ on the 25th of March (2015) and comes forward with bold claims of being the world’s second largest digital currency. This claim seems based on the users, LEOcoin claims to have 100,000 entrepreneurs already using the currency though it only launched on the 25th of March.\n\nDespite only just being launched some 100,000 entrepreneurs are already actively using the currency in anticipation of its trading debut, making it second only to Bitcoin.\n\nWe are currently in pump stage.\n\nContrary to the information provided by LEOcoin, and their recent CNBC article promoting it, as citing it as a rival to bitcoin. And contrasting initial videos from the LEOcoin CEO (Dan Anderson) from summer of 2014 stating that LEOcoin will be widely accepted within six months, there is to date;\n\nNo merchants accepting it, online or otherwise.\n\nUndisclosed pre-mining (unless you count this article).\n\nA copy/paste of Bitcoin, no additional features.\n\nThe company therefore claims it has 131,176 registered businesses ready to use LEOCoin ~ CNBC.\n\nI was unable to find one merchant that currently accepts LEOcoin, claims that make it identical to bitcoin with no notable additional features, no statement of pre-mining. And a seemingly misunderstanding of what constitutes a deflationary digital currency.\n\nThis claim indicates that all other digital currencies (bar bitcoin) have less than 100,000 users. You can view coin market cap to have an idea of the market cap and available supply of the leading Cryptocurrencies. Out of the 500+ coins listed here, LEOcoin is not yet listed.\n\nApparently committed to producing 28,800 LEOcoins per day, for a period of 99 years. The total amount of LEOcoins produced in this period will be just over one billion. LEOcoin states itself as a deflationary currency.\n\nA difference here from bitcoin is that bitcoin slowly halves its issuance rate towards a steady decline of issuance until there are no more bitcoins issued. A common bitcoin theory is that this steady decline in bitcoins will coincide with increased value.\n\nHowever, LEOcoin will produce the same 28,800 per day until it suddenly stops issuance. Until this point, same as bitcoin, it will still have monetary supply inflation.\n\nThe LEOxChange is planned to be launched on April the 2nd, and will be located in Hong Kong. The LEOxChange headquarters are located in Oxfordshire, which would place their governance under UK jurisdiction. Temporarily this means that they would not be required to be an MSB (Money Services Business), but may soon be required to be registered.\n\nAmazing usability and accessibility?\n\nLEOcoin claims to offer greater usability and accessibility when compared to other digital currencies; it will provide emerging start-ups and enterprises no intermediary charging commissions. Citing YouGov statistics that state how small to medium sized enterprises are often charged high fees for international trade.\n\nIncluded in the claims that LEOcoin is expected to have greater usability and accessibility,\n\n“LEOcoin is truly an anonymous digital currency, in contrast to others which are anonymous only on a superficial level.”\n\nIt offers security in that;\n\n“Once the payments are made, you need not worry about chargeback. And that it is user-friendly and does not require specialized knowledge.”\n\nA possible confusion with their statements about ‘commission’, is that they possibly might mean that their exchange (LEOxChange) will not take commission, mostly.\n\nConflicting itself, LEOcoin states that the exchange has;\n\nZero Commission: no commission or transaction fees on purchases. A small commission on sales.\n\nCommission on sales is still commission. What they are referring to is a maker-taker style of commission.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nBitcoin itself does not charge commission, and it already addresses the international high fees as charged by traditional financial services. And the steady decrease of supply inflation of bitcoin lends itself to a steady adoption rate, a continued inflation of 28,800 per day, ending with a sudden drop off, could make some bitcoiners flinch.\n\nA digital currency does not become deflationary (in regards to its supply) until it stops producing, or is producing so little that more will be lost than is produced in a given period.\n\nPotentials interested in LEOcoin should also be aware that it has in fact been in existence for quite some time already, that at the time of writing, it’s most recent block processed was number 406694.\n\nThough there is nothing essentially wrong with pre-mining. It is considered good form that a ‘newly launched’ coin should state whether it has been pre-mined or not. Quite a few people would probably not check thoroughly. The LEOcoin mining pool has been up and running since the 6th of August, 2014.\n\nMining statistics and more detailed information can be found at the LEOmine site. There is no stated notable difference between bitcoin or LEOmine, and no evidence of the 100,000 entrepreneurs that apparently are using it already.\n\nAbout LEOcoin\n\nLEOcoin is a brand new digital currency that allows individuals to make fast and secure transactions through a decentralised peer-to-peer network. It’s digital cash, so any and all transactions are completely anonymous without the need for bank or transfer fees. Support by a large community of established and aspiring entrepreneurs, LEOcoin has great potential for rapid growth and expansion. Accessible to everyone, it’s easy to use and available today.\n\nMore information on LEOcoin can be read via the LEOcoin news feed, from the LEOcoin site, from LEOmine, or from the Buy LEOcoin site. There is even, hashtalk, and a bitcointalk thread started by ‘leocoin2015’ who starts the thread asking if others have heard of this new coin and indicating that he would like more information about it.\n\nhey guys..i know its bitcoin forum but did you hear for new coin called leocoin ? any news are welcome. i see official site is www.leocoin.org\n\nthanks for info ~ leocoin2015\n\nFor the technical minded among you, here is the Github link for LEOcoin, https://github.com/Leocoin-project/LEOcoin. We can see from here that the company behind it have 50 million LEOcoin in stock. There is no halving of the block reward (as previously stated), and the block award is 20 coins (which can be confirmed via the LEOmine statistics).\n\nEvery money needs to be spent. You can spend your LEOcoins on many online or even or retail shops. You can also trade your coins for some other crypted valute.\n\nYou should thoroughly do your research if you plan to invest in this coin, it smells rather strongly of a pump & dump.\n\nDisclaimer: Any views or opinions are that of the author and should not be construed as from CCN.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Merchants using payment authentication provider CardinalCommerce will now be able to accept bitcoin alongside alternative payment options including PayPal and Google Wallet.\n\nThe announcement is the result of a partnership between CardinalCommerce and bitcoin merchant processor Bitnet that enables merchants with custom-built shopping carts to send API messages to Cardinal\'s platform through its One Connection service.\n\nAs part of the integration, CardinalCommerce handles updates and changes necessary to accept the payment method, and will help facilitate refunds through Bitnet.\n\n""As a merchant accepting bitcoin via Cardinal, if there was some change to the protocol or Bitnet\'s APIs, Cardinal would handle that.

It signed a partnership with Spondoolies Tech, a provider of mining hardware, to acquire a significant amount of mining equipment. Spondoolies became a shareholder at about 10 cents a share and in exchange, BTCS was able to ramp up its mining operations from 176 Th/s (tera hashes per second) to 891 Th/s.\n\nAllen said that if the effort works, the company is ready to quickly scale from there.\n\nIt signed a lease in a repurposed manufacturing building with 83,000 square feet. The first year rent is $58,271, and if the operation goes according to plan, BTCS has the option to buy the facility outright in the second year.\n\nAllen feels this is the perfect time to get into bitcoin mining because the price has dropped enough that everyone else is starting to leave.\n\n“The mistake everyone made was that they didn’t care about cost structure,” Allen said.\n\nIn other words, everyone kept thinking about how the price could go to the moon, so they didn’t try to get the cheapest electricity or the best hardware. Allen explained that there were miners who were paying 10 cents per kilowatt hour.\n\n“You need to be under 6 cents per kWh. If you’re in the 3-4 cent range, you’re doing good,” Allen said.\n\nOperation Hedge Strategy\n\nBTCS intends to succeed with a mechanism it calls Operation Hedge. Allen believes it will be one of the cheapest — if not the cheapest — miners on the market. That means that it can tolerate bitcoin price drops more than other miners.\n\nAllen is banking on smaller and more inefficient miners to go offline as the price drops, which will cause the network hash rate to drop and the difficulty with it. If that happens, BTCS’ overall operation will account for more of the total hash rate, which will result in more bitcoin mined per month.\n\n“Because we were able to get the lead manufacturer [Spondoolies] to take equity, we are in a good position,” Allen said.\n\nBetween the decreased cost of hardware because the life of mining hardware increases when the difficulty drops, the decreased costs to run the mining operation, and the increased number of bitcoin mined, BTCS expects to find success in its mining operation.\n\nIt’s About the Ecosystem\n\nBTCS isn’t just looking at mining, though it is the way to generate revenue fastest with Bitcoin. The company is expanding into the entire sector, trying to become a universal Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIt has made strategic partnerships with GoCoin, Gem, Expresscoin, and Coin Outlet, which will allow it to spread out into multiple parts of the total network.\n\nIn particular, Allen feels that remittance is the way that businesses can generate revenue longer term. If mining is 1-2 years, remittance is likely 3-5.\n\n“The best way for remittance to work is to set up ATMs,” Allen explained. “You have one in the target country as well as the originating country, and users can go in and out of bitcoin.”\n\nIts partnership with Coin Outlet will allow it to quickly grow out the ATM business across the world.\n\nMining As a Business\n\nBTCS is in a position to get into the mining business at an attractive price point. And as it scales, Allen explained that its power costs will decrease for each kilowatt hour because it will be able to negotiate based on its buying power.\n\nIn the United States, Washington State is the best place to mine and then, Allen said, North Carolina, which is where BTCS has its operation. The electricity is cheap enough, and with its Spondoolies hardware, it is in a good position to take a significant amount of market share.\n\nPhoto by Beraldo Leal /CC BY 2.0', 'A senior Hong Kong official has indicated that the government does not see a need for legislation that would regulate or ban bitcoin activities.\n\nThe statement by Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Professor KC Chan comes in response to a question submitted during a meeting of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong by council member Leung Yiu-chung.\n\nLeung requested an update on the investigation into the MyCoin bitcoin investment scam as well as clarity on whether officials intend to regulate bitcoin activities more actively, according to a press release from the Hong Kong government.\n\nIn response, Chan described bitcoin as limited in scope, noting that it does not pose a substantial threat to Hong Kong\'s financial system given its current lack of widespread adoption in the region.\n\nChan said:\n\n""The Government does not consider it necessary to introduce at the moment new legislation to regulate trading in such virtual commodities or prohibit people from participating in such activities.""\n\nChan added that, should the need arise, Hong Kong regulators can draw from existing legal statutes, both domestic and international, to deal with instances of fraud or criminal activities that involve digital currencies.\n\n“The police will take enforcement action if they find information which involves criminal conduct,” he said.\n\nWatchful stance outlined\n\nIn his response, Chan suggested that his office and others will continue to watch developments in the bitcoin space.\n\nFurther, he outlined how financial institutions in Hong Kong are subject to strict reporting requirements ""when establishing or maintaining business relationships with customers or clients who are operators of any schemes or businesses relating to virtual commodities"".\n\nChang added:\n\n“The Government and financial regulators will keep a close watch on the development of bitcoins and other virtual commodities, and maintain contacts with their counterparts in other places through active participation in meetings of the relevant international organizations (such as the Financial Action Task Force.”\n\nReiterating past warnings issued by the Hong Kong government, Chang stated that “the highly speculative nature” of bitcoin presents a potential risk to investors.\n\nMore Mycoin details\n\nLocal law enforcement officials continue to investigate the collapse of MyCoin, which resulted in millions of dollars in losses for investors in the scheme, according to Chang.\n\nPolice have since arrested several individuals in connection with the fraudulent enterprise.\n\n""The Commercial Crime Bureau of the Police is investigating the case, and has searched various locations and seized a number of computers, tablets, mobile phones, account records, etc.,"" he said.\n\nChang added that those arrested during the investigation have been released on bail.\n\nLegislative council building image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Survey respondents did not appear to be familiar with the image, giving answers such as “bewildered,” “no reaction,” and “I don’t know what that means.” Among the respondents who expressed something besides confusion, the sentiment was largely neutral, with several positive and negative words appearing equally as often (“optimistic” versus “greedy” or “great” versus “annoyed”).

03/26/2015,"['Measures to support the digital currency in the budget should help bring it closer to the mainstream, writes Jon Card\n\nMost will have missed Chancellor George Osborne’s reference to digital currencies during his final budget speech of this parliament. But among the tranche of budget documents released by the Treasury on 18 March was one entitled: Digital Currencies: response to the call for evidence’.\n\n\n\nIt marked the first time measures to support digital currencies have been included in a budget and for fintech entrepreneurs such as Tom Robinson it was most welcome. Robinson is co-founder of startup Elliptic, which provides a secure place for financial institutions to store their bitcoins.\n\n\n\nHe took part in the consultation and believes progress has been made. “We are happy with it. It follows the recommendations that we and other businesses made, such as bringing digital currencies under anti-money-laundering legislation. This will bring legitimacy and clarity to the industry,” he says.\n\nBitcoin is very efficient for retailers because you are cutting out the middle man Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic\n\nFor Robinson, greater credibility and understanding of digital currencies is key. He was also pleased when Osborne himself bought some bitcoin last year, saying it gives the currency credibility, and hopes government is catching on quicker than it did with the internet. “Hopefully, government isn’t going to make the mistakes of the mid-1990s, when we missed out on much that happened.”\n\nHow it works\n\n\n\nBut bitcoin and other digital currencies are far from being accepted by the wider public, or many businesses. For those not in the know, cryptocurrencies are created by software and operate on a peer-to-peer basis, bypassing banks altogether. They have no national or sovereign guarantor. This means, as the government has noted, they can be a highly efficient means of transaction. “Bitcoin is very efficient for retailers because you are cutting out the middle man, such as Visa or Mastercard, that takes 3% of every transaction,” says Robinson.\n\nAlso exciting is the blockchain technology that sits behind it; a giant, decentralised public ledger that records all bitcoin transactions. The blockchain is thought to be unhackable and for retailers it provides a guaranteed way of knowing if a transaction has gone through. It also has the potential for other information to be attached to it.\n\n\n\nSo if someone made a purchase, such as a car or insurance policy in bitcoin, this could be logged next to the transaction and held in perpetuity. Robinson says: “The important thing is that it is decentralised; there’s no central control. It records every single bitcoin transaction, although it can be used for a range of different assets, not just currency. There are a lot of real-world applications.”\n\nThe downsides and exchanging bitcoin\n\n\n\nWhile bitcoin is the best known and most popular digital currency, there are many others in use. Therefore, its future is by no means certain and some wonder whether it will be supplanted by another in the future. Furthermore, no digital currency is underwritten by a national government, so if one of them collapsed tomorrow users would stand to lose all they had.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has also proven itself to be prone to volatile price fluctuations, which means retaining the currency in a bitcoin wallet can be a risky decision. For this reason, many companies that accept bitcoin tend to do it through a third party company such as Bitnet or Bitpay.\n\n\n\nThis allows them to accept a payment, but then exchange it into a fiat currency (sterling, dollars, euro) before there is any chance of devaluation\n\nLessons from Silicon Valley: can UK business copy the region’s success? Read more\n\nStephen McNamara is chief technology officer of Bitnet, which he co-founded in January 2014. McNamara’s background was in the online payments industry. He previously worked for CyberSource, which was acquired by Visa. “When we came across bitcoin, we saw it as a really elegant solution for a lot of problems we had been trying to solve with online payments,” says McNamara.\n\n\n\nSimplifying international payments\n\n\n\nMcNamara says airlines are interested, as they are plagued by high levels of fraud. He says the blockchain eliminates this concern and makes international transactions far simpler. “The challenge for businesses dealing with customers in many countries is the complexity of the different financial systems and networks,” he says. “With bitcoin, they can create a global reach and anyone with a smartphone is a potential customer.”\n\nEntrepreneurs should be aware, though, that digital currencies, unlike fiat traditional money, is not guaranteed by a national government. If a digital currency’s value collapses, or the money is stolen or lost, the owner may be left with nothing. However, there are many enthusiasts and their combined digital wealth represents a market in itself.\n\nSpending bitcoin\n\n\n\nRusty Nash is co-founder of Gift Off, which lets customers convert digital currencies into vouchers and gift cards used by major retailers such as Amazon. Nash says: “I was getting involved in bitcoin early on, but back in 2013 the only thing you could buy with it was web-hosting or soap. We set up the gift card business and the momentum just grew and grew as so many people wanted to spend their bitcoin on everyday things.\n\n\n\n“A lot of our customers are early adopters and hold a lot of bitcoin, but need some way of spending them. They bought when the price was cheaper, so their holdings are worth a lot more. People that want to liquidate their coins in the UK can use our service.”\n\nThe business accepts more than 20 different online currencies, although bitcoin is by far the most popular. Nash retains a lot of bitcoin and uses suppliers that accept it, including his accountant.\n\n\n\nHe says the biggest benefits are security and efficiency. “You can take payment from anyone and you can do that with absolute confidence that it has gone through as you can track it on the blockchain,” he explains. “There are no chargebacks and the fraud risk it absolutely minimal. Once someone has put something on the blockchain, they can’t take it back. “Also, you don’t need to provide a shipping address. All I need is an email address to send the codes to. With credit cards, you need an address, and this data can be hacked.”\n\nBitcoin also enables Nash to trade internationally in many countries, despite the fact his business is still very new. “We have companies approaching us that are interested in bitcoin and want to gauge the market. They are taking us right across Europe and help us to expand internationally.”\n\nSign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.', 'Announced March 25, Bitwage is partnering with Xapo to create the world’s first international bitcoin payroll debit card. This is a big step forward for bitcoin practicality in the workplace, and in everyday life.\n\nLast year Xapo raised US$20 million of funding, aiming to simplify security for bitcoin users, which is a constant issue in this corner of the tech industry. You can check out an interview with their CEO here.\n\nBitwage launched last year, coming about because of “…a missing link in the current financial circle - Payroll. If Bitcoin is to be popular, payroll is eventually going to be part of it.” Founder of Bitwage Jonathon Chester chatted with us here at CoinTelegraph a few months ago about this and more.\n\nOne of the most oft heard criticisms of bitcoin’s usefulness today is a supposed lack of utility. This is largely a PR problem, as much as bitcoin acceptance is, but presents a valid point. There may be many services that can help take care of many day-to-day tasks, like paying for groceries, but they are often unintuitive or too intimidating for the average consumer. This partnership seems to be a step in the right direction for bridging that gap between the crypto-enthusiast and the everyman.\n\nThis is a new chapter for both companies with the partnership launching in beta, meaning that everyone who signs up will receive free Bitcoin debit cards.\n\nThese payroll BTC debit cards can serve dual purposes. First, it can aid in lowering overhead costs for businesses with payroll and wait time for payout on their employees’ earnings. It also makes it possible to easily spend funds anywhere with a card reader, simplifying the sometimes complicated process of spending bitcoin at brick and mortar stores.\n\nSince Bitwage partnered with Xapo for these cards, they’re able to send them to over 170 countries, and dispense earnings in local currencies. However, the cards cannot be sent to the US currently, but they reassure us that the cards will be distributed in the US as soon as possible where they will already be operational.\n\nCurrently, users can sign up at Bitwage’s site and get their free debit card to take advantage of this new system.\n\nNote: We’ve reached out to Jonathan Chester for a few extra words on this big partnership, and we’ll add in his interview as soon as we can.', 'Cryptoine has been hacked and its hot wallets emptied -- but the exchange blames a programming bug rather than a full-scale cyberattack.\n\nCryptoine was a Tor-friendly exchange post which traded in 34 different kinds of cryptocurrency. Despite emphasizing a focus on anonymous trading and core security features -- including secure SSL connections, two-step verification and a decentralized environment -- Cryptoine has simply become the next exchange to become the focus of an attack, less than a month after AllCrypt closed its doors.\n\nAt 8:36am UTC on Wednesday, the virtual currency exchange posted an update on its website, which at the time of writing is no longer operational. The trading post apologized and said that this week, a cyberattacker spent approximately seven hours plundering the system and draining Cryptoine\'s hot wallets -- the online storage facilities used for currency including Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin.\n\nHowever, the cyberattacker did not have to break into the system in order to steal funds. Instead, Cryptoine admitted a bug in the trading engine allowed the hacker to manipulate balances as they wished.\n\n""The hacker found some race condition bug in our trading engine. Manipulation of orders gave him false balances,"" the exchange\'s website states. In other words, a bug disrupted events happening in the order the program expected -- so withdrawals based on time and checks could be altered to compromise wallets. If two or more threads are attempting to access data at the same time, ""racing"" to access or change the data, the hacker may have exploited the bug to prevent the proper flow of access data and therefore make withdrawals that were not checked or verified as the program intended.\n\nCryptoine insists that there was no break-in and no personal data was leaked; nor were any private wallet keys compromised. In addition, the trading exchange says the hacker was not able to execute any external code.\n\nWhile the bug has been located and fixed, Cryptoine users are still victims, and the company says ""the losses are irreversible."" Bitcoin, Litecoin, Urocoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoinscrypt, Magi and Darkcoin were among the currencies stolen.\n\nAll might not be lost for users. The exchange is closed, Cryptoine is saying ""goodbye to all crypto-community,"" but the firm insists the post will only be gone for a few months as a break, and ""we will back stronger and more experienced than ever before.""\n\nIf the trading post does reappear, users may be able to recover some of their lost funds. Cryptoine has promised that all of the coins left will be returned to users -- due to a hot and cold wallet storage ratio of 60 percent to 40 percent -- and those stolen will eventually be returned in ""correspondingly smaller quantities."" A screenshot of the hacker\'s activities is below:\n\nWhile there is no word on how much was stolen, Cryptoine has promised to reveal more details of the security breach soon.\n\nRead on: In the world of security\n\nRead on: Fixes and Flaws', 'Digital currency Bitcoin just took a giant leap in India. Very soon, you can buy yourself a home, book tickets of various events such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches, and pay restaurants in Bitcoins after having a nice meal.\n\nIndia’s first Bitcoin app, Zebpay is working out details with a property developer in Ahmedabad to use Bitcoin for selling residential flats, in addition to doing a pilot project in Mumbai for paying restaurant bills.\n\nZebpay’s co-founder Saurabh Agarwal says that, “We want to make transacting in Bitcoin as simple as Whatsapping. We will soon be able to buy IPL tickets using Bitcoin, we have sold Flipkart and Amazon vouchers among others. We have started a pilot with a restaurant chain in Mumbai who want to trade in Bitcoins and we have signed a MoU with an Ahmedabad-based developer who wants to trade flat in lieu of Bitcoins.”\n\nZebpay recently hosted a Bitcoin conference, Future of Money in Ahmedabad which was attended by over 400 Bitcoin enthusiasts including industry leaders, B-school students, YPOs, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), and the media.\n\nZebpay has been making aggressive strides in the Bitcoin industry.

He advises companies about bitcoin-related regulatory law and represents companies and individuals in civil and criminal proceedings.\n\nHere, he discusses why a new securities ruling is a potential boon for \'crypto 2.0\' and \'bitcoin 2.0\' companies operating in the US.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted regulations permitting crowdfunding for business startups.\n\nThe new rules give businesses in the blockchain ecosystem an avenue to get financial backing from the best-educated investors out there: their users.\n\nI wrote last week about the challenges that \'bitcoin 2.0\' companies face from the squishy definition of a ""security"" under US law. These new rules don’t resolve that ambiguity, but they do create a low-cost safe harbor for businesses that want to avoid uncertainty (and possible criminal exposure) by simply treating their token sales as sales of securities.\n\nHere’s how it works: prior to these rules, a company could generally sell securities only to wealthy individuals or after going through expensive registration with the SEC.\n\nNow, companies can file a mini-registration statement with the SEC and then sell securities to ordinary people, including over the Internet.\n\nAs an added bonus, state-level compliance under these rules is minimal, as the SEC has largely preempted state securities laws in this area. There is, of course, a whole bunch of fine print.\n\nBusinesses that choose this route, for example, will need audited financial statements, and will have to do some ongoing reporting to the SEC. There are also limits on how much capital you can raise this way, though those limits — $20m or $50m, depending on which “tier” of the rule you use — are unlikely pose problems for most companies in the space.\n\nSimilarly, companies can accept only a certain amount of money from each investor. But again, the limit is relatively high — 10% of each investor’s wealth or yearly income — and even better, companies can generally rely on investors to self-certify that they’ve met this requirement.\n\nOther details are more mundane, but also put this firmly in the don’t-try-this-at-home category: There are rules about sales by affiliates, rules about pre-sale “solicitations of interest,” and lots of rules about what goes in the mini-registration statement. Prior “bad acts” can also disqualify a company from using the provisions, and only US and Canada based (and incorporated) issuers qualify.\n\nThese new rules are good — and potentially revolutionary — for bitcoin 2.0 companies.\n\nBut they’re also good for all companies in the bitcoin ecosystem, who can take advantage of them to raise capital from their tech-savvy pool of users. Selling securities this way still isn’t a walk in the park — it will place some additional burdens on companies and require careful legal advice. But it is decidedly good news that companies can now count this path as among their options.\n\nPlant image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'While Columbus seems to be gradually getting interested in Bitcoin, an Ohio State student’s Bitcoin startup has been operating out of a Silicon Valley business accelerator.\n\nBitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency system developed by a secretive programmer in 2008. It’s an alternative to federally recognized currencies like the U.S. dollar.\n\nBitcoins can be earned by solving equations with a computer, a process called mining. When a computer mines successfully, it’s rewarded with bitcoins, like when a miner finds gold. The reward is programmed to decrease at intervals until no new bitcoins are generated, so mining has become less profitable over time.\n\nMuch like gold and silver, the price of a bitcoin fluctuates. A bitcoin was worth more than $1,000 in December 2013, but today it’s worth about $250, according to Coinbase, a Bitcoin transaction website.\n\nOwning Bitcoin isn’t like owning a physical commodity since you can’t touch it, but obtaining it isn’t difficult: First, download a bitcoin wallet. Second, buy some bitcoins.\n\nJad Mubaslat, a fourth-year in biomedical engineering, is one of the people making it easier to buy Bitcoin. He founded BitQuick.co in 2013, a startup which facilitates buying Bitcoin from other people online.\n\nMubaslat was one of the first students to publicize Bitcoin at OSU. Last year, he encouraged Backroom Barbershop and Salon owner Shawn Mensi to start accepting Bitcoin, and in the fall, it became the home of Columbus’ first Bitcoin ATM.\n\nIn spring 2014, Mubaslat founded the OSU Bitcoin Group, a student organization that advocates for Bitcoin usage. It’s advised by Alan Chalker, director of technology solutions for the Ohio Supercomputer Center at OSU.\n\nChalker said he has been following Bitcoin since it was created and was eager to talk to others about it and other cryptocurrencies. Part of his job is coordinating requests to use the OSU supercomputer, and on occasion, he gets requests to use it for Bitcoin mining.\n\n“Nowadays, it’s a complete waste of resources and funding to do it,” Chalker said. “We’ve had a couple situations where graduate students are supposed to be doing other things on our system that we’ve discovered were trying to mine bitcoins, and we’ve shut them down.”\n\nHowever, Chalker said he is beginning a research project that will determine if other cryptocurrencies can generate enough of a profit to justify using OSU’s supercomputer.\n\nThe OSU Bitcoin Group is made up of both students and community members, Chalker said. It recently elected a new president, Ben Fershtman, a first-year in pre-biomedical engineering.\n\nFershtman said he wants the club to focus on philanthropic opportunities with Bitcoin and help other students, like Mubaslat, who have relevant ideas.\n\n“I’m not sure how many ideas will come through, but I’d like to see some,” Fershtman said.\n\nAfter expanding his business from the U.S. to Taiwan, India and the Middle East, BitQuick’s growth was stagnating, Mubaslat said.\n\nMubaslat and BitQuick chief operating officer Chad Davis, who works on the business full-time, traveled to North Carolina for a Bitcoin conference in 2014. There, they met venture capitalist Adam Draper, chief of Boost VC, a Bitcoin business incubator in California.\n\nBoost, a “Bitcoin accelerator,” invests in 20-30 companies twice a year, providing amenities like housing and office space for the companies they choose, according to its website.\n\n“He told us that we need to start focusing, and he thought we were spread out,” Mubaslat said.\n\nThey applied for Boost’s fifth “tribe” of businesses six months later. After deciding to take Draper’s advice and focus on the U.S., Mubaslat said they applied on the last possible day.\n\nA week later, Draper called them with good news: BitQuick was chosen to be a part of Boost’s tribe.\n\n“Me and Chad were psyched,” Mubaslat said.\n\nFor BitQuick’s tribe, Boost has gone “Full Bitcoin,” meaning that all of the companies it has chosen to invest in are Bitcoin companies, according to their official blog. BitQuick is one of 24 Bitcoin-based businesses which has been operating out of Boost’s space in the Silicon Valley for the last three months.\n\nIn addition to space, mentorship and promotion, each business will receive 300 bitcoins at the conclusion of the incubator in May, currently valued at about $73,000, based on the current value of bitcoins on Coinbase.\n\nSince joining Boost, BitQuick has had consistent growth, Mubaslat said. The week before leaving for Boost, they had $22,000 worth of Bitcoin transactions and 81 unique users. Those numbers have climbed week-by-week, reaching $73,000 worth of transactions last week as well as 130 unique users.\n\nBitQuick has upgraded, too. They started using a three-password encryption method for each transaction and are now insured for $250,000 worth of bitcoins through a BitGo institutional Bitcoin wallet, a computerized “wallet” with extra online security for institutions.\n\nThey also started using ID verification through Netverify, an online and mobile payment identity verification company, to exclude black-market activities from the service, which Mubaslat said is a common problem with Bitcoin services.\n\nMubaslat said Bitcoin keeps distancing itself more and more from the black market, citing the rise in Bitcoin acceptance by businesses like Microsoft and increased investment in Bitcoin from major players like the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThese uses have the potential to increase as Bitcoin support is added to payment software used by businesses, as well as mobile applications, Chalker said.\n\n“You’ve got Apple Pay and Google (Wallet), more and more of these electronic payment things, and it’s great for Bitcoin because it’s just another flavor to it,” Chalker said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mubaslat is still enrolled at OSU and plans to graduate on time in May.\n\nMubaslat said he might move the business back to the Silicon Valley after graduation because of the connections he has made there.\n\nFershtman said he would “absolutely” take an opportunity like Mubaslat received for BitQuick.\n\n“That’s the dream right there, going to Silicon Valley and getting the opportunity to work on something like that,” Fershtman said.\n\nMubaslat agreed.\n\n“I feel like I’m living the dream, honestly,” he said', 'Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) has received approval to list on the securities marketplace OTC Markets Group, meaning shares could begin trading as soon as next week.\n\nIn preparation for the debut, the private investment vehicle owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG) has announced the launch of Grayscale Investments, which will sponsor the BIT, taking on responsibilities as necessary to register and run the fund.\n\nCommenting on the news, director of sales & business development Michael Sonnenshein laid out a broad vision for the latest entrant in the larger DCG entity, the parent brand for bitcoin products and services spearheaded by founder Barry Silbert.\n\nSonnenshein told CoinDesk:\n\n""We\'re trying to establish ourselves as the trusted authority on digital currency investing, and seek to develop a fleet of investable products that will allow people to invest in digital currency.""\n\nSonnenshein indicated that Grayscale\'s name was inspired by the appearance of a distributed network of nodes at distance.\n\n""As you draw back away from it, it reveals this nice grayscale, it\'s a mathematical look at it, and it\'s a name we all really loved,"" he added.\n\nNo set trading time\n\nWhile certain eligible owners of BIT shares will be able to start trading as soon as next week, Sonnenshein stressed that Grayscale can\'t predict exactly when this process will begin.\n\n""What is going to be traded are existing shares and those shares are owned by people who have owned them for longer than a year. Having owned them longer than a year, that means they no longer have a restriction on them, but shareholders have to elect to sell those shares,"" Sonnenshein explained.\n\nThe process, he suggested, could take up to several business days, and may be influenced by factors such as the price of the shares when initially purchased, a time close to when bitcoin was trading near peak levels.\n\nStill, Sonnenshein expressed his hope that original shareholders would be willing to sell to satisfy market demand, stating:\n\n""We have no control over how many people chose to sell and chose to buy, that is all market-driven.""\n\nConsumer warnings\n\nOf note on the new Grayscale website may be the lengthy terms and conditions, which include language that articulates the volatile nature of bitcoin, as well as how the fund is not registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, a tactical move that allowed it to be first-to-market with a bitcoin investment vehicle.\n\nAddressing concerns these might alienate potential buyers, Sonnenshein stressed that this was concurrent with Grayscale\'s duties to disclose the risks of the fund alongside its benefits.\n\n""We all know that bitoin is a volatile investment. Like any investment there are those certain disclaimers that we include in our language,"" he said.\n\nSonnenshein emphasized the exciting nature of the launch, which he contends will provide a more familiar experience to investors who don\'t want to go through the friction of buying and storing bitcoin but nonetheless want exposure to the market.\n\nContinued development\n\nSonnenshein also provided details about the day-to-day operations at the firm, which is based out of the larger DCG office in New York.\n\nGrayscale, he said, is now hiring to expand its team, which he described as small but looking to grow given the new activity he expects around BIT.\n\nBIT will continue to create restricted shares for sale to eligible investors, while those who don\'t meet such qualifications will be able to purchase shares through the OTCQX marketplace.\n\nThe fund is listed under the symbol GBTC.\n\nManhattan skyline via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The explanation includes a Q & A, but mostly diverts responsibility away from the site’s owners.\n\nThe process of verifying the provenance of a hack is an arduous one indeed. Many times, hackers delete all logs on their way out, a wise move that makes it all the more difficult for the server administrator to figure out who ate his or her lunch. But the owner was able to determine what took place by reading the logs of the actual exchange, and was also able to get hold of an IP addresses linked to the attacks.\n\nAround 8PM on Sunday (all times EDT) our marketing director’s blog account requested a password reset. […] The MD saw this email come in, and forwarded it to myself, and another team member (a technical lead/temporary assistant support staff), letting us know what happened and that he did not request the password reset. I did not see the email at the time, as I was out, and it was not a huge red flag that would require a phone call. Once I returned home later, I saw the email, and logged into the server to double-check on things. That’s when I discovered the breach.\n\nAlso read: AllCrypt.com Bitcoin Exchange Goes Down\n\nThen, the plot thickens. It seems the “technical lead/temporary assistant support staff” was also compromised, and from there things get very confusing.\n\nApparently, the thief had gained access to the tech assistant’s email account. That email was hosted on a private server (not gmail, yahoo, etc). We have no idea how the password was acquired. We spent a lot of time this week downloading password lists from torrents, tor sites, etc, and could find his password in none of the lists. He assures us he did not use the password in multiple places, and that it was a secure password. Our best guess is that it was a brute force attempt.\n\nApparently the private mail server used by the “technical lead” does not log password attempts. Red flag number one, as people involved in technical work know to use only the best. A more serious approach to the whole thing would have been to have regular audits of the entire system. Indeed, outside e-mail should not have been used at all, and passwords should have regularly required resetting anyhow. This seems common sense, but as always, the hindsight view is 20/20.\n\nWordPress In Itself was A Mistake\n\nWordPress is a blogging platform. Using it for something as serious as handling the transfer of thousands of dollars, or potentially hundreds of thousands or more, is absolutely a failure in logic. Even if you had to begin with a WordPress platform to get off the ground, you should not have continued using it once money started flowing. Either a proprietary solution developed in-house or a solution licensed from a veritable vendor would have been more appropriate.\n\nThe culprit seems to be WordPress in every way, since the hacker was able to use it to upload adminer.php, a well-known database management tool which allowed him to modify the site’s database at will. He then sent MySQL calls for non-existent accounts to have their balances changed. At some point, the site’s “secondary accounting system” was able to stop him, but he was able to recover from this roadblock and continue by converting the fake balances to other coins, an obvious oversight in the architecture of the exchange.\n\nWhat does this mean? Despite not being able to continually creating false BTC balances, he was able to buy Dogecoins using the fake BTC balances and then re-convert that to BTC again. Thus, he was able to withdraw the now adequately acquired Bitcoin to address 17B8qfaeNsv3TZbpycUs6dkzYiJGWNeCw5. It seems that when the DOGE buy orders dried up, he withdrew DOGE as well, to address DJiYqeXZBJXbmsWMefpRY7dEsJDASFAYxX.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nAllCrypt Gone For Good\n\nThe owner, who appears to be anonymous according to WHOIS information, claims that the site cost him a total of $15,000, and further that they only netted roughly 10 BTC in profits after thirteen months of operation. We can guess that he lives on the east coast of the United States given that he times everything to EDT. The biggest contributor to their low-profit margin was consistently low volume. Also, they were often not quick enough to add high-value coins.\n\nIt kills me that this happened. We had a small hack a year ago, and we recovered near instantly. And we were secure and solid for a year, and decided to shut down because of lack of volume, and lack of profits. Our profits were lost as well. We only made 10.8 BTC over the course of 13 months of operation. Between hardware and operating costs, I am personally down over $15,000. Believe me – I feel your pain as well. No one on the site had as much on the servers as I personally did. Not that I expect pity or compassion, but I think it’s important to know that I’m not retiring to a private island because of this. I also think it’s important to be as open as possible to assuage any fears of an inside job.\n\nHe then goes on to answer some of the questions he’s allegedly received from angry customers whose money has been lost. It is important to note that this was inevitable. It seems the WordPress platform was wrongly used even after the previous hack, which is telling. His diffident air is essentially the nail in the coffin, ensuring that no one will want to do business with AllCrypt if they ever were to relaunch:\n\nQ: Your security sucks! A: I see you running an exchange successfully, I’ll take your advice. Wait, you don’t run an exchange? You’re unemployed? Thanks for the input.\n\nAs the song says, it’s not what you make, it’s what you leave. There’s no telling if anything in the blog post was true, if it was indeed an inside job done by his employees (who couldn’t have been making much), or if it was a genuine hack. What is evident is that running an exchange is a massive undertaking, and should not be taken lightly.\n\nAt the time of AllCrypt’s launch, exchanges were popping up left and right to absorb the volume vacuum left by the death of Mt. Gox. SwissCex is another which recently decided to shutter its doors for lack of volume. ShapeShift.io, which does not require users to create accounts at all and relies on the implicit security of block chain technology, has become more and more popular, and maybe for good reason.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"

What is money? Money has always been a scarce metal like gold, where you can\'t inflate it away because there\'s a limited supply of it.”\n\nPayPal fined US$7.7 million for allowing illegal payments\n\nThe US Treasury Department has taken aim at payments giant PayPal, imposing fines of US$7.7 million for allowing transactions, which violated America\'s sanctions policy. PayPal had voluntarily handed over evidence of cases where they had failed to screen payments that ended up in Iran, Cuba, and Sudan.\n\n“In total, according to the Treasury Department, nearly 500 PayPal transactions, worth almost $44,000, had potentially violated sanctions that ban US companies from doing business with individuals or organisations on a blacklist.”\n\nBitcoin Investment Trust’s sponsor Grayscale launches\n\nFollowing the recent news that the Bitcoin Investment Trust is now trading shares on the ticker GBTC, the parent entity Digital Currency Group has launched of Grayscale Investments, tasked with sponsoring the BIT fund.

Coming into force on April 1, the rules will involve digital currency businesses complying with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements and reporting suspected laundering (AML).\n\n“[B]itcoin businesses will have to comply with the island\'s anti-money laundering laws.

But it can also be put to malicious use. According to Interpol’s Christian Karam, speaking from the Black Hat Asia conference, it could be abused to store malware control mechanisms or provide access to illicit content such as child abuse images that would be extremely difficult to take down.\n\nTo prove the point, Kaspersky researcher Vitaly Kamluk, who is currently on secondment at Interpol, created a proof of concept software, which had the potential to become malware, that could take in information from a hacker-controlled Bitcoin address (the unique identifier of owners of cryptocurrency) and a transaction hash (an encrypted representation of a transaction) over a command line. The demo app, as Kamluk calls it, connects to the Bitcoin network, requesting certain blockchain data from a Bitcoin address containing the ostensibly legitimate, but potentially malicious, information on the network. The app then locates the related transaction information from the data, extracting chunks of code stored as recipient Bitcoin wallet identifiers, he told FORBES. These are then pieced together and run.\n\nA malicious hacker could use such techniques to craft payloads that would perform actions on target’s PCs, such as stealing data or scooping up passwords with keyloggers. In the proof of concept, the software was primed to take commands from hacker tool Metasploit, but the researchers were keen to point out they did nothing evil with their power. Such attacks would also work with any other blockchain-based cryptocurrency, Kamluk and Karam said.\n\nThe issue lies in the ability to “pollute” the blockchain with information that isn’t related to transactions. There are a variety of known methods for adding arbitrary data to the blockchain. This “bloat” has long been seen as a problem with the ledger, though it’s also there by design. It\'s what allows services like PayStamper to add data to the blockchain, in that company’s case information related to customer transactions. Once the information is there, whether for good or bad, it’s there forever under the current rules of Bitcoin, notes Kamluk.\n\nThere have been some prior indications such techniques could be put to criminal use. Last year, a virus signature from the infamous Stoned virus was uploaded to the blockchain, though there was no obvious danger to users.\n\nUniversity of Newcastle researchers earlier this year presented “ZombieCoin”, a botnet command and control (C&C) mechanism for sending commands to malware running on the Bitcoin network. Their method was similar to Kamluk and Karam’s. To send messages to their bots, they used the OP RETURN function, which allows Bitcoin users to insert up to 40 bytes of data in transactions. That bandwidth “is more than sufficient to embed most botnet commands which are typically instruction sets in the format”, their paper read. They also used some “subliminal channels” in the signatures sent out across the network.\n\nUsing these techniques, they were able to have their bots carry out commands, including the collection and encrypted transmission of a screenshot back to their botnet master system. They claimed any regulation or attempt to delete bad blockchain data would have a negative impact on the cryptocurrency, as it isn\'t designed to be tampered with.\n\n“We believe this is a desirable avenue botmasters may explore in the near future… Bitcoin is an ideal C&C dissemination mechanism for botnets,"" the paper read.\n\n“Most importantly, C&C communications over the Bitcoin network cannot be shut down simply by confiscating a few servers or poisoning routing tables. Furthermore, disrupting C&C communication would be very hard to do without seriously impacting legitimate Bitcoin users and may break Bitcoin.\n\n“Any form of regulation would be a fragrant violation of the libertarian ideology Bitcoin is built upon. It would also entail significant protocol modification on the majority of Bitcoin clients scattered all over the world.”\n\nIttay Eyal, a Bitcoin researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell, believes that botnet owners would be put off using the blockchain for their malware communications, as “the goal is timely transfer of commands and feedback”. But the Newcastle study showed that 50 per cent of the time the bots responded within five seconds of a command going out, and 90 per cent of the time within 10 seconds.\n\nNewcastle researcher Taha Ali told FORBES there are two issues with using the blockchain for botnet attacks. A sizeable botnet could start making too many connections to the Bitcoin network and deny normal users access - effectively carrying out a Distributed Denial of Service on Bitcoin. And as Bitcoin usage is very limited today, network admins in big companies will find it suspicious if too many PCs suddenly start connecting to the Bitcoin network one day. ""However, as Bitcoin usage grows - as trends seem to suggest - then the botnet scenario is very very promising,"" Ali added. ""Criminals don\'t need to create their own C&C infrastructure, Bitcoin is already resistant to typical botnet takedown tactics, and anonymity and security is already built in.""\n\nThough for now, Blockchain-based botnets remain the work of researchers, not criminals, as far as anyone is aware, their potential as a surreptitious form of malicious communication remains a concern. “The use of the blockchain for command and control of malware is even more difficult to control, because the instructions can be encoded in a way that looks opaque to everyone except the malware itself. There is no good solution for this; it’s a price we have to pay for freely transmitting information,” added Eyal’s Cornell colleague, Emin Gün Sirer.\n\nGavin Andreson, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, said using C&C on the blockchain would be “very expensive” due to the transaction fees hackers would have to pay. He also noted that botnet operators don’t want there to be any permanent record of their crimes. “The risk to them is that their command server gets seized, and then they are prosecuted for everything it ever did. It is much better if the commands are impermanent. Using the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network (instead of the blockchain) makes a lot more sense, but there are much larger peer-to-peer networks where botnet activity is easier to hide, so even then it is unlikely any botnet operator would choose to piggyback on the Bitcoin network.”\n\nWhilst there have been no concrete examples of botnet control via the Blockchain, there have been a number of cases of illegal content appearing in the database. Links to child abuse imagery were allegedly placed in the ledger back in 2013.\n\n“This is not good for the network or the database,” added Karam, who is worried about such material being irremovable and accessible in perpetuity. He wants the Bitcoin community to take note of the pollution problem, though hasn’t directly reached out to stakeholders.\n\nBlockchain.info, which provides services for exploring the blockchain and Bitcoin wallet provider, declined to comment on this article.', 'Bitcoin-to-cash service Bit2Me has cancelled its commission fees in a bid to remain competitive in the Spanish market.\n\nThe announcement follows on from BTCPoint, another withdrawal service which launched earlier this month with zero commission fees.\n\nPreviously, Bit2Me charged its users a 1% commission fee per transaction, raising some concerns among Spain\'s bitcoin community.\n\nDaniel Diez, business development manager at Bit2Me, attributed the decision to a shift in focus from monetisation to short-term growth, adding:\n\n""Our main priority is to offer the best possible service. We were the first to develop a technology that enables the widespread use of bitcoin.

Airtime purchases made from Celery’s exchange take the money straight from the person’s bank account, similar to the process of buying bitcoin.\n\nIn addition, Bitrefill is eliminating fees for airtime remittances to India. The U.S.-India corridor contributes largely to the $70 billion worth of remittances that flow into the Asian country each year.\n\nA Proven Model\n\nIsmail Ahmed, founder and CEO of WorldRemit, told Mobile World Live in 2014, that informal airtime remittances could make nearly half of the $40 billion worth of remittances that flow into Africa each year.\n\nAhmed made that comment shortly after raising $40 million from Accel Partners and others in a Series A Round, so his money transfer company could pursue airtime and other remittance services.\n\nAirtime remittances are particularly valuable for people sending amounts of money worth under $20. According to TransferTo‘s CEO Eric Barbier, that’s the “sweet spot” for the unconventional money transfer. Remittance companies charge too much to make remittances of such a small amount possible, but airtime services’ low fees make it a viable option.\n\nIn many parts of the world, airtime minutes are not only serving as an informal money transfer system, but also as actual money. According to the Economist, in places such as Haiti, Zimbabwe and Egypt, airtime minutes are used to buy things such as gasoline, water and electricity.\n\nAccording to Hannes Van Rensburg, Visa’s head of their sub-Saharan Africa division, airtime as money is particularly popular in countries where rigid regulatory schemes have made it very difficult for banks to offer new kinds of electronic money.\n\nEven places such as Kenya, where mobile money such as M-Pesa is extremely popular, airtime as money has found a use case. Airtime minutes’ relatively stable price serves as a better store of value than the Kenyan shilling, causing people to hold airtime minutes rather than shillings.\n\nBitcoin’s UX Problem\n\nA lot has been said about how non-user-friendly bitcoin can be, but according to Bitrefill CEO and co-founder, Sergej Kotliar, it’s really bad. During an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Kotliar said users in many countries remain confused how to use bitcoin when paying for Bitrefill’s service.\n\n“They had to be walked, step by step, through the process,” he said.\n\nThe partnership with Celery will allow users to take advantage of Bitrefill’s cheaper rates and convenience, while never having to touch the rather confusing digital currency.\n\nAfter signing in, Celery users will see a “Phone Refill” feature toward the bottom of the screen. The user then chooses the amount he or she wants and clicks “Purchase.” The same amount is deducted from the customer’s bank account by Celery, which sends the order for airtime minutes to Bitrefill. The recipient receives the airtime a few seconds later.\n\nBut overcoming Bitcoin’s UX problem is just one of the steps the company is taking to reach its grander goal.\n\n“We want to connect the worlds of prepaid and bitcoin. For bitcoin to be used by developing countries, they need to be able to spend it,” said Kotliar. “You can’t exchange bitcoin easily in the developing world, but you can spend airtime easily.”\n\nFull-Fledged Startup\n\n“As Westerners, we didn’t realize how much of the world used prepaid phones. It’s actually the way the majority of the world receives their phone minutes and data,” said Kotliar.\n\nBitrefill launched in October as a side product for its two co-founders, Kotliar and Aleksandra Derikonja. But a month after launching the service, the company received a lot of interest from the press and, subsequently, from users.\n\nThat provoked Kotliar and Derikonja to think more deeply about the prospects of bitcoin in the prepaid airtime industry. After researching the industry more, they discovered that a bitcoin-powered airtime service could solve issues of convenience, price and more.\n\nBitrefill is headquartered in San Mateo, California, as part of the Bitcoin startup accelerator program Boost VC. They are using the opportunity to further develop their business and to network with other Bitcoin companies.\n\nIn the upcoming year, the company will be signing deals with exchanges in Europe and then other parts of the globe. They wish to bring the same “bitcoin-in-the-background experience” to more countries around the world.\n\nThe Bitcoin airtime merchant also will be releasing an API that will allow any Bitcoin business to integrate Bitrefill into its website.', 'A few weeks ago Bitcoin Magazine reported that the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) was about to become the first publicly traded Bitcoin fund. On Thursday, the BIT received formal approval for listing on the OTC Markets Group’s OTCQX exchange. The fund is listed with the symbol GBTC, and trading is expected to begin early next week.\n\nBarry Silbert announced on Twitter that the BIT fund is live and waiting for eligible shareholders to deposit their shares and sell.\n\nThe BIT is the first product from Silbert’s new Grayscale Investments, a digital-asset management firm being launched concurrently by his Digital Currency Group. The Wall Street Journalnotes that the BIT is the latest addition to the growing number of bitcoin trading platforms that aim to expand bitcoin investments beyond the volatile spot exchanges and attract a new class of investors.\n\nEach share of BIT is worth approximately one-tenth of a bitcoin. Holders of BIT shares won’t hold bitcoin in their names, but they will hold shares of the fund, which itself holds bitcoin. Since the value of BIT shares will fluctuate with the exchange rate of bitcoin, the fund will be a convenient investment vehicle linked to bitcoin – in particular, investors will be able to short the fund and profit from drops in the price of bitcoin. The availability of traded funds linked to bitcoin and investment vehicles such as options, futures and other derivatives is expected to contribute to stabilizing the value of bitcoin.\n\nThe BIT skipped the lengthy SEC registration process by taking a shortcut approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Without SEC registration, the BIT can’t formally be considered as an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), but other funds are seeking SEC approval for listing on the NYSE or Nasdaq. The Winklevoss twins are planning a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, which will be available to investors on NASDAQ with the ticker COIN.\n\nThe BIT will open bitcoin investing up to the wider world of capital markets and traditional investors who prefer not to trade bitcoin as currency because they are scared by bitcoin’s wild price swings.\n\n“Over the past three or four months, a handful of banks have started to experiment,” said Silbert. “Some of them are experimenting around trading, some around using the blockchain for settlement, and some are interested in deploying capital as investors.”\n\nThe Grayscale website notes that digital currencies are poised to radically transform our financial system, but it won’t happen overnight.\n\n“At Grayscale, we believe investors deserve an established, trusted, and accountable partner that can help them navigate the gray areas of digital currency investing,” the website says. “That’s why we are building transparent, familiar investment products that facilitate access to this burgeoning asset class, and provide the springboard to invest in the new digital currency-powered ‘internet of money.’”\n\n“The hope within the bitcoin community is that BIT and future publicly traded bitcoin investment vehicles will improve liquidity and thus help smooth out some of the price volatility that has plagued bitcoin in its early years,” notes PandoDaily. “The fact that BIT is also now a regulated entity should help calm the (justified) fears of many prospective bitcoin investors. A more stable bitcoin market is seen as being a necessary pre-condition for widespread adoption as a payment vehicle.”\n\nImage via Grayscale Investments.', 'Get Swansea updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

Users can now spring for one of these upgrades using BTC, as it’s known, instead of USD, through a Coinbase account.\n\nYou could say that accepting bitcoin was just a marketing gimmick—that OkCupid, which is part of Match Inc., owned by Barry Diller’s IAC, was just looking to garner some goodwill and buzz among tech types. And it did get them that, even if the number of A-list subscribers that pay with bitcoin is likely small. The Financial Times, at the time, called OkCupid “the biggest brand name” to begin accepting the digital currency. OkCupid founder and CEO Sam Yagan, who is also CEO of Match Inc., reasoned at the time: “There’s no question that these digital currencies are going to be the future.”\n\nBadoo, a London-based dating site founded in 2006 by Russian entrepreneur Andrey Andreev, also takes bitcoin. The site started accepting bitcoin in January, in just Spain, Italy and the UK, through Dutch payment platform Smart2Pay. This month, it expanded that option to 20 more countries. A Badoo spokesperson said that it was “reflective of Badoo’s position as an early adopter.”\n\nBut few other major dating sites take bitcoin, even though so many of them now offer goodies that users can pay for with a tap in a mobile app. Some of those sites use a “premium” business model that allows access only with payment. Others have a “freemium” model, where the core service is free but upgrades come with a cost. All of them could easily make the same move as OkCupid and Badoo. Why haven’t they?\n\nZoosk, which recently appointed a new CEO, moved to a premium model in November. Its users now must spend money to message other users, which wasn’t the case a year ago. But the service still lets people purchase certain features without becoming full members, using digital currency it calls Zoosk Coins. Those features include raising your popularity on the site (with a feature called “Boost”), unlocking new matches (in its “Carousel”), and buying virtual gifts for other members.\n\nNeumate, a lesser known dating site, also uses its own digital token, which members can send to non-members to give them 24 hours of access to Neumate’s premium features. Indeed, even mighty Facebook (FB) once offered credits that its users could put toward electronic gifts, like stickers, for friends.\n\nZoosk has members in 80 countries and currently accepts 55 different currencies for payment. At the moment, bitcoin, which has made major progress toward legitimacy in recent years, is not one of those 55.\n\nIn Zoosk’s case, it may be because Kelly Steckelberg, Zoosk’s new chief executive, remains hesitant. “I don’t know that bitcoin is at a place yet that it makes sense for us,” she says, “but certainly if it ever got there, we would consider it, absolutely. I think that if it eventually becomes a mainstream payment option, we would certainly look at adding it to the currency that we support.”\n\nAt its current pricing, 180 Zoosk Coins will run you $20—that’s about 11 cents per Zoosk Coin. Or, at bitcoin’s value at the time of writing, .0004407 bitcoin.\n\nWatch more business news from Fortune:', '""There’s a metaphor to it,"" CEO Pieter Gorsira explains, addressing his startup Lawnmower, and its, by bitcoin industry standards, unconventional name.\n\nIf the name Lawnmower at first keeps users at a distance, however, the explanation does much to illuminate the novel concept the Boost VC startup is hoping will help it become a low-risk bitcoin investment solution.\n\n""Working backwards, it\'s like we’re running the lawnmower over the grass and we’re clipping off a little bit of change. So, as you go along, we slice all these little blades of grass and collect change from these transactions,"" Gorsira continued.\n\nPut more directly, Lawnmower uses an API developed by Spark Capital-backed Plaid to connect to users\' online banking accounts at Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank and US Bank.\n\nFrom there, Lawnmower watches its users\' accounts for transactions, rounding up the purchase of say a $3.50 latte to $4 and saving that 50 cents for later. Once users have accumulated at least $4 in total savings through small debit or credit purchases, Lawnmower purchases bitcoin on behalf of the user.\n\nThe effect, according to Gorsira, is a solution to bitcoin\'s volatility that also allows investors a chance to get exposed to its potential benefits.\n\nGorsira told CoinDesk:\n\n""We’re trying to raise consumer awareness about bitcoin and give them an easy way to get in without huge commitment, so you can buy $3–$4 every couple days instead of buying bitcoin at $300 and worrying about where it’s going to go.""\n\nAs for whether the name is the best way to communicate these goals, the three-person team (complemented by CTO Patrick Archambeau and CFO Alex Sunnarborg) behind the project is confident it will resonate with consumers, or at least, differentiate it from the competition.\n\n""Having \'bit\' or \'chain\' is like an Internet company having the letter E, like E-school.com,"" Gorsira added.\n\nCompetitive edge\n\nThe idea that spare change can be converted into investments is not exactly a new one, with the concept already in use by startups like Acorns, an app that has raised $9m in funding to allow users to make small-scale investments.\n\nGorsira acknowledges that he was worried that Lawnmower wouldn\'t be first to market with the concept in the bitcoin space, expressing a fear that a company the size of Coinbase could develop a similar app ""in a week"".\n\nStill, the team reports that Coinbase isn\'t interested in a similar idea for its own, and that to some extent, the company supports the Lawnmower project. ""All of the bitcoin is housed on Coinbase, so when you sign up you have to have a Coinbase account that you log in with,"" Archambeau clarified.\n\nAs for a long-term competitive advantage, Lawnmower\'s team sees its product evolving similarly to Acorn\'s in terms of the variety of investment options it offers.\n\n""We have a lot of different ideas like putting 20% of the savings into a different currency like litecoin, dogecoin or maybe having a slider that lets you invest 200% of your change into bitcoin,"" Gorsira said.\n\nBeta launch\n\nLawnmower officially opened a beta on 25th March, allowing a small group of users into the program for an initial glimpse. Sign-ups, Archambeau said, are still available.\n\nIn part, the team wants to get some fresh air into the room in terms of the ideas that they\'re able to generate for the project, so that they can best align the final launch product with informed feedback.\n\n""We need to see what people like or don’t like so we can start adding features. The point is to have users use it, break it and tell us if they like it. [It goes] beyond three people who live in the same room everyday. We get kind of hive-minded,"" Gorsira quipped.\n\nAs for signing up for the service, beta users will need to have iOS 8 to run the TestFlight application, though Lawnmower is built for iOS 6 and 7 compatibility.\n\nThe installation process is simple provided users meet these qualifications, as the app quickly moves through a series of windows that encourage users to connect to their bank and answer security questions necessary to access the accounts.\n\nFiat-to-bitcoin bridge\n\nOver time, Lawnmower sees value in creating a platform that it believes will have a unique set of users among bitcoin companies, especially given that it will in effect monitor the traditional financial behaviors of bitcoin users.\n\n""There’s no company in the bitcoin space that has those ties with fiat,"" Gorsira said. ""By linking your spending and saving if you will, having information on both the bitcoin and fiat side is a lot more powerful.""\n\nGorsira described Lawnmower as a bridge between products like Mint and Coinbase, in that it appeals to both sets of distinct users, though he believes the company will likely seek to move beyond bitcoin.\n\n""People are starting to get used to conscious saving. So, [we want to] target those people who are less technical and encourage them to diversify some of their assets,"" Gorsira continued, concluding:\n\n""We have a lot longer plans once we acquire a user base.""\n\nImages via Lawnmower\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""The Washington DC-based organization Cato recently announced some “good news:” that civil asset forfeiture – that is, state seizure of a person's home, car, and bank accounts – has been “abolished” in New Mexico.\n\nNot mentioned in the report, however, is that New Mexican bureaucrats will not be giving up the thievery. Nope. It's just that now they'll jump through a few more legalese hoops before they send in the guns. So all told, probably two or three fewer people will have their lives destroyed this year. Maybe. If the court dockets are jammed.\n\nIn other words, the “good news” from New Mexico is a shiny red ribbon placed atop a piece of shitcake. But does wrapping shitcake in red ribbon make it any less shitty?\n\nThe Bitcoin Response\n\nInterestingly, Cato's announcement became a topic of discussion on the Bitcoin subreddit.\n\nAnd why would anyone think that cryptocurrency – magical Internet money – could protect property? It all comes down to an understanding of the different forms that property can take, and the knowledge of more than one way to protect it. In the words of redditor kwanijml, there are better ways than shiny shitcake to “virtually deny the state from being able to do what it wants to do.”\n\nAnd that's precisely where Bitcoin comes in.\n\nSelf-Banking and Smart Property to the Rescue\n\nWhat if your property were digital and therefore impervious to men with guns? Or, if physical, what if your property were passphrase-protected so that it was useful to you and only you?\n\nThese are the two forms of property protection that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have to offer. And unlike the legislation whimpering out of New Mexico, Bitcoin's promises actually have teeth.\n\nThe first – digital property – is the kind of property that many savvy people are opting for these days. Sure, you could have a large house, three cars, and a summer bungalow with a pool and tennis court, but these assets are rather difficult to travel with. They're also difficult to protect.\n\nBut what if you could take the monetary value of all these assets and just carry it around in your brain instead? What if instant and global access to US$5 million was achievable with a passphrase that only you know? Such is the offering of a Bitcoin brain wallet. It's self-banking at its most sophisticated.\n\nOr maybe you're the physical goods type. Maybe you want your assets piled high and wide. In that case, what if the steering wheel of your Tesla wouldn't unlock unless the driver enters a private key? What if the electricity in your smarthouse wouldn't turn on without it? What if your pool released flesh-eating piranhas onto keyless trespassers? (Weird example, but you get the picture.)\n\nThis is the promise of smart property: physical goods equipped with computer chips which only offer full accessibility with the owner's private key.\n\nThe Road Less Taken\n\nOf course, one is always free to pass on the property-protection services offered by cryptocurrencies. One could just continue pushing for state legislation, or as one redditor said, take “one step forward and two steps back.”\n\nAfter all, three hundred years' worth of petitioning governments for protection has finally solved our problems, right? . . . right?\n\nOr if you're the wild and daring type, you might instead seek to protect your assets with sophisticated self-banking and – when it gets here – advanced smart property. Necessity is, after all, the mother of invention. You might not have to wait long. As they say, keep calm and crypto on.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

03/28/2015,"['Editor’s note: this is the first of a two-part series.\n\nFirst things first, I am no IT security expert or Bitcoin core developer-level coder. The technical bits of Bitcoin are not my strength, nor my concern. Bitcoin’s currency, not its Block Chain, are in no real need of security optimization. You can make a wallet as secure as you want it to be, from multi-sig to cold storage, to paper wallets. If you hand your bitcoins to a third party, that’s your choice. And the Block Chain has had no actual security issues in its entire existence. The basics with Bitcoin are established, well-designed, and are not in need of repair. To follow up upon my previous article about Bitcoin’s reputation, the problem with Bitcoin is not the technology or design, it’s those who deal with it the most. Bitcoin’s security isn’t flawed. The people who use it most are. The biggest fish in the pool are perhaps the weakest links.\n\nNovices think you can divorce the Bitcoin currency from the Bitcoin Block Chain, but that is like removing the tracks from a tank. Any problems with the currency deeply affect the entire network’s ability to function as intended. The currency’s price is nothing more than a reflection of its strength versus the fiat currency of choice. Considering the short-term strength the U.S. Dollar is now showing globally, there is no need for a better financial mouse trap, at this time. That can be a card Bitcoin can play at a later time. With that in mind, Bitcoin’s teething problems right now are real and need to be addressed with the long-term health of Bitcoin in mind. This time should be spent perfecting Bitcoin’s ability to acquire new users and serve the newest members to the community to the best of its ability. These problems we’ll call “Exchange Risk,” meaning problems safely exchanging new fiat currency or existing Bitcoin, at Bitcoin exchanges due to potential theft or closure. This is the biggest problem facing Bitcoin right now. Trust in Bitcoin exchanges has really dropped within the last year, and this reflects badly on the entire Bitcoin community.\n\nLet’s think of it as designing Bitcoin 2.0. What should the next few years bring to Bitcoin in regards to a better, safer purchasing experience. Can you minimize Exchange Risk, without over-regulating Bitcoin, and throwing the baby out with the bathwater?\n\nBitcoin Regulation is not needed. Oversight is.\n\nThe problem is that the casual investor is now seeing the exchanges, where Bitcoin meets the world most directly, as the weakest link in Bitcoin’s security. This means many will never experience digital currency at all. There may be a day in the future when there are no more fiat currencies, and the mainstream monetary systems are digital like Bitcoin; easily integrated into Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Until then, we, as a community, need to find ways to make exchanges more secure, more accountable, and less prone to destroying overall trust in the Bitcoin currency. Leaving this to national governments, Ben Lawsky-type regulators, or the exchanges themselves is a poor man’s game, and will only lead to larger issues for Bitcoin. We have to be better than that, and hold the management of these companies to a higher standard or suffer the consequences of their ultimate failure.\n\nBitcoin will only become more and more valuable as we go forward. Need any proof of that? Just ask NASDAQ, as they announced on Monday that they were going to build digital currency exchanges with Bitcoin startup Noble Markets in New York. A brand and company with the size and clout of NASDAQ isn’t jumping into Bitcoin unless the demand and upside are HUGE! This means they know of hundreds, maybe thousands of institutional investors, corporations, and hedge funds that want in on Bitcoin, and want to deal with their branded service to do it right. NASDAQ may be after only the biggest of fish, but the ante in Bitcoin exchanges has just been upped. Can the current crop of Bitcoin exchanges handle these growing market pressures, and the responsibilities that come along with that?\n\nDo you think the temptation to make an exchange and run away with the BTC under the cover of darkness will go down as its value increases? When exchanges are holding thousands of BTC, worth hundreds of million of dollars, will the ownership that in effect controls these Bitcoin allow themselves to be held accountable, at that point? Why would they do that? This exchange issue needs to be nipped in the bud, and an exchange protocol needs to be established now, or else the whole Bitcoin concept will collapse upon itself, it’s just a matter of time. As generally corrupt as the central banking system is, having a $250k Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) guarantee of your deposit account is valuable and necessary. People trust the system because of this safeguard. Bitcoin has no such thing right now, and going from an established safety net to none with a person’s personal wealth is not very realistic, nor logical.\n\nLike using a regular bank, you don’t have to to have money or do business with them at all, just like you don’t have to use an exchange to get Bitcoin. It does make the currency easier to acquire and much more convenient overall, and we humans like greater conveniences, not fewer as we evolve. Exchanges will be seen as nothing but neighborhood gangsters if they don’t up their game in the name of consumer protection to compensate for their lack of FDIC protection.\n\nFor the first five years, until Mt. Gox, there probably wasn’t one exchange failure, not that there were that many exchanges to begin with. Now, with more exchanges, there is more exchange risk. With more value in the global Bitcoin market, there are more exchanges created, by who knows who. New exchanges are popping up all the time, only to be closed just as fast, with the walls far from barren. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out some people are smart enough to build an exchange and win some accounts from those who want to invest, but are only after a short-term theft. I’m tired of reporting on one theft or failure after another. It won’t get any better as each Bitcoin becomes more valuable over time, and it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nIs there any record of who controls these exchanges? Are they accountable to anyone? Letting a private bank run an economy is exactly how the U.S. Dollar is run with the Federal Reserve, and how is that going, by the way? The U.S. Dollar is going to lose its Global Reserve Currency status within this decade, destroying the dollar’s value for all times and the U.S. economy with it. Dollars used to hold checks for Gold on deposit. Now they are only valuable if you believe in their value. They have no inherent value at all.\n\nGovernment has let The Federal Reserve, which is about as “Federal” as Federal Express, run amuck, and has been complicit in the economic destruction it has produced. Have we not learned from the mistakes happening right now in the economy? Don’t Bitcoin owners deserve better for their faith in Satoshi Nakamoto‘s vision? What are we doing to protect Bitcoin from “bad actors?” Not much, from where I sit. The last few months should be an aberration, not accepted as the cost of doing business. The Bitcoin Community has to make some choices as it grows, and the sooner, the better. If not, we risk destroying what could be the greatest thing we’ve ever had through our neglect. An economy of our own, designed to be more valuable as we grow older and use it more, and far more valuable than any fiat currency ever could be.\n\n“It Takes a Village to Raise a Child”\n\nHave you ever heard that saying before? It definitely applies to bringing new Bitcoin owners/users to the community. And it applies to the Bitcoin technology itself. If an exchange has unknown leadership, with no widely recognized standards for fiduciary responsibility, and no assurances it’s going to be there tomorrow morning, why should someone outside, or inside, of the Bitcoin community trust them? What’s the difference in sending a child into a building that could be a bank, a haunted house, or an abandoned building? A new user doesn’t know what’s going on inside of an exchange, and is taking quite a leap of faith. One exchange could be just like a bank. One can be gone tomorrow with the funds. It’s a roll of the dice. No wonder the community has not grown as expected.\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin itself being the child that must be raised by the village, if you see a problem, you should say something, just like with so-called “terrorism threats.” The government uses terrorism as a catch phrase to take your freedoms away, but we can use these exchange closures as a way to bolster consumer confidence without destroying Bitcoin’s natural freedom of use. With half as much thought as Satoshi Nakamoto put into Bitcoin itself, we can come up with a way to protect it from “bad actors” in the exchange industry. I clearly see exchanges as a weak link, and am going to propose what I can see as potential solutions. The exchanges themselves should be one step ahead of me and this article. They should be working together to bolster consumer confidence, raising security standards, and not waiting for oversight from a nation-state’s politicians. A good idea can come from anywhere. Hopefully, I have one! If you have one, share it below.\n\nThe point is, the stronger exchanges become in protecting, the greater good, the more money they’ll make in the long-run. Also, the faster Bitcoin and the community can grow and prosper, So this is pretty important. Now, let’s get to the solution phase of this article.\n\nWhat are your options?\n\nI’m just going to throw out an incomplete list to get the ball rolling, to get you thinking. Please add any suggestions in the comments below. The goal is to make people new to the Bitcoin community feel safe adding money to the ecosystem without creating a regulatory environment like fiat currencies have, and need. I’m really simple-minded. I think the Bitcoin community should have a Bitcoin version of everything successful and useful that exists in the establishment’s modern economy. Bookstores, bakeries, auctions, and private financial insurance companies, like the FDIC.\n\nThe FDIC has proven to be incredibly effective in growing the banking industry over the last seventy-plus years, and doesn’t really have a downside risk worth mentioning. With smaller U.S. banks closing by the hundreds annually in the U.S., banks themselves aren’t inherently safe. They close at a rate not dissimilar to the Bitcoin exchanges over the past year. And just because you are a bank does not mean your money or information, are safe. Just see the security breach at JP Morgan Chase last year. JP Morgan isn’t going under anytime soon, but they can be compromised just like Target or Home Depot when it comes to protecting the information from 21st-century hackers. Bank safety is one of many illusions in the greater fiat economy.\n\nWhat banks have, that Bitcoin obviously does not, is the FDIC as a safety net. There is a reason the FDIC shield is prominently displayed at your bank teller. The local bank teller is really no different than an online exchange website account, except the Bitcoin exchange website account has no such protections to advertize at this point. Look at it this way. If a bank didn’t have FDIC protection, it would be very similar to a Bitcoin exchange today, except be primarily offline. When the FDIC was created in 1933, it raised the perception of the entire industry greatly, making them much more trust-worthy. The adage about hiding money in your mattress came from the early 20th century for a reason. This is why the FDIC insurance model has lasted over seventy years. Because it works. So the Bitcoin ecosystem should definitely look at it as a model of success that may need to be integrated as Bitcoin exchanges and the economy as a whole grows.\n\nIn a banking system that is built around making as much money as possible, legally and otherwise, a consumer can always know that they will get their money back if the bank folds. It may take several months, but with proof of account, you’ll at least get $250k back, to protect the most financially vulnerable. Anyone with an ounce of economic sense isn’t leaving more than $250k in a bank at the current rates anyway, plus factoring in a real-world inflation of 5-8%. The $250k is per account, not per person, so you can have a trust for your child, a joint account, an account for yourself, and an account under your spouse’s name and get $1 million protected, if you so desire.\n\nCan Bitcoin offer FDIC-type insurance? Well, an exchange can offer that itself as some extension of its sales pitch, but that would be just as senseless as if a bank insured itself. That wouldn’t stop the bank from folding with your funds and your so-called insurance. The FDIC is a third-party insurance corporation for a reason.\n\nAny private corporation has shareholders and needs to make a profit. Just ask The Federal Reserve. The FDIC being an insurance company can only cause so much damage without creating national monetary policy. Suffice to say a very well-funded private group would have to handle the creation of such an insurance corporation for the Bitcoin community. The corporation would most likely get paid on a monthly basis by the exchanges it agrees to insure. Just like a car dealership pays insurance on its vehicles held in escrow before they are sold to the consumer, or how banks currently pay insurance fees to the FDIC. Seems like a good idea, as it has worked well elsewhere. Bitcoin doesn’t need insurance, but users need separate insurance from exchange risk, especially as the Bitcoin value grows over time.\n\nThe consumer can get insurance privately for the Bitcoin, but it doesn’t look like this has been invented yet either within the Bitcoin community. Plenty of cottage industries are available in the Bitcoin community for the entrepreneur. That is a prudent, but unlikely scenario, at least initially. Most of us have auto and health insurance, but not Bitcoin insurance. Hey, who knows? It could be the biggest thing of 2017.\n\nFinally, I think there needs to be a way to prevent exchanges from closing clandestinely without a third party. This needs to be seriously considered given the fact that exchanges are handling money that is not their own. The reputation of the Bitcoin community indeed rests on how they handle the fiduciary responsibilities of being a de facto bank. If an exchange has your hand over your private keys, they need to be far more secure than an exchange that does not need both keys. Until a third-party protection system for consumers is established, every exchange should have an external third-party who can stop the closure or the transaction of closure from being completed without an audit or funds protection.\n\nThis would be perfect for an organization like The Bitcoin Foundation to lend oversight. They cansend out press releases regarding the exchange, account for the exchange leadership, and audit their accounts at the first sign of trouble. No exchange should hold more than 50 BTC without being vetted by a third party. The management should be identified and accounted. Any quarterly audits should be stored with the third party (see The Bitcoin Foundation). Approved exchanges should be listed on the Foundation’s website, with audit history, current security features for consumers, and whether they can maintain a 100% reserve ratio.\n\nThis sounds like regulation, and this may be how regulation starts, but oversight does not give the third party power over the entity. The Bitcoin Foundation would not become judge, jury, and executioner. It would be understood, in the Bitcoin community, and by your users, that you are not a trusted exchange until you have a minimum of X number of bitcoins. Also, you transact in fiat currencies, and you submit to auditing by the third party, The Bitcoin Foundation in this hypothetical example. The third party is a legal arbiter, not a regulator. They lend credibility, not rule of law. The Bitcoin community will in effect be the law. We will decide what third party is trusted to provide exchange oversight, and what exchange is maintaining a responsible standard with our investment.\n\nI make the distinction between functional oversight and Bitcoin regulation because the mainstream has not mastered the art of financial regulation. I will go over Bitcoin Regulation Risk in the upcoming Volume 2 of this article tomorrow.\n\nThe point is oversight, not regulation, can help Bitcoin, and cause minimal damage to its original mission of personal freedom and peer-to-peer transactions. The Bitcoin community needs to start policing itself when it comes to exchanges and third-party handling of Bitcoin. If the Bitcoin exchange market doesn’t correct this matter internally, with Wall Street getting ready to do cannonballs in Bitcoin’s pool, Wall Street will correct it. And Wall Street cares about Wall Street, not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just another investment vehicle to manipulate for them. For us, this may be our last shot at economic sovereignty. Let’s act like it.\n\nSo an FDIC-type corporation to bolster trust in the Bitcoin exchange community, and protect consumers from “bad actors”. Private Bitcoin insurance for individual investors, when they buy from Bitcoin exchanges, especially if they require private keys, which is a red flag in itself. And Bitcoin Exchange auditing and oversight.

Separating Bitcoin from the blockchain, however, misses the fundamental, interdependent relationship between digital currency and its underlying blockchain technology.\n\nIn other words, you can’t have one without the other.\n\nTo be clear, when some speak of loving blockchain technology, they are referring to its use in areas beyond transferring monetary value, so called “Bitcoin 2.0” functions. For purposes of this article, I am not referring to these Bitcoin 2.0 possibilities. Rather, this article addresses whether blockchain technology can exist as a medium to exchanging financial value without bitcoin, or any native currency component.\n\nValue Transfer\n\nThe blockchain is a peer-to-peer public ledger maintained by a distributed network of computers. There is no central authority, and no need a trusted third party to process and verify transactions. Eliminating the need for third party intermediaries while maintaining a system that is completely secure, trusted, and verifiable is why the blockchain shines as a technologically innovative medium of exchange.\n\nTo accomplish this, the blockchain must record transactions in a manner that allows anyone to objectively determine how much value has transferred just by observation. Let’s say Sarah in the United States wants to send money—US$100 worth—to Adam in the Czech Republic. Doing this through traditional means—say a bank wire—requires intermediary banks to process and settle the transaction by making sure Sarah is debited, Adam is credited, and so forth.\n\nTo do this via blockchain technology without intermediaries, the transfer of value must be recorded in a way so that Sarah, Adam, and anyone else can look at the ledger and clearly determine that value has passed from Sarah to Adam. This occurs by recording the transfer of a digital coin—or token—from Sarah’s wallet to Adam’s wallet, demonstrating the transfer of value.\n\nTo be a truly decentralized exchange without intermediaries, this token cannot simply be a marker representing some other value, this token must speak for itself—it must have price. With the exchange of bitcoin, we know Sarah transferred value to Adam because she transferred something valuable to Adam. We know bitcoin is valuable because we can go to one of many exchanges around the world to buy and sell it at the prevailing market price.\n\nIn Sarah’s case, the transferred token should have a price equal to US$100 dollars, 2,500 Czech crowns, or whatever unit one wants to use to measure its price at the time of the transaction. Thus, the entry on the blockchain ledger records the circulation of a token with price to signify the exchange of value—which looks a lot like currency.\n\nAny entity, whether it’s a solo programmer or IBM, is free to create its own blockchain with its own digital token, which would essentially be one of many “alt-coins” in existence. While little is known about IBM’s blockchain plans, if they—or any other entity—wants to utilize blockchain technology as a decentralized medium of exchange, it must involve the transfer of a valuable digital token—and something does not become valuable just by saying so. This is determined by the market.\n\nIf IBM’s plan involves some form of a centralized blockchain, then the participants could define the value of its token within the closed system. This system would not be open and trustless. Participation in this blockchain would be limited, the participants would have to agree upon the value of the token, and a central authority would have to hold the parties to this value. Outside these participants, a centralized blockchain would be useless and its tokens would be of limited value.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin’s price is supported in large part by speculators who are attracted by its potential to increase in value due to its scarcity, secure network, and first-mover advantage. Any would-be decentralized blockchain would have to convince the market its digital token is valuable, which is no small feat.\n\nAlternative blockchains would be in competition with Bitcoin’s blockchain, which already has a vast pool of miners and participants working to secure the network to earn bitcoin; its structure would be in competition with Bitcoin’s decentralized model open to all participants; and its tokens would be in competition with bitcoin, which, while volatile, has thus far stood the test of time and has gained price worldwide.\n\nBy Waseem Karim\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

We need more cutting edge tech entrepreneurs.\n\nLuckily there’s a new space in Houston, Texas, built just for that, provided by Cryptospaces, which is backed by bitcoin consulting company, FinalHash. Located at 6907 Almeda Rd., the Houston Bitcoin Embassy is an incubator/ coworking space dedicated to tech startups. There are also plans to install a bitcoin ATM in the facility by the end of April.\n\nThe Embassy is home to the Texas Coinitiative, a non-profit organization that promotes the use of Bitcoin in Texas.\n\nThe Coinitiative mission statement reads:\n\n“We believe that our growing community will help to shape progress in this field. Come network with traders, entrepreneurs and innovators working in one of the most interesting sociological and technological innovations in recent times.”\n\nThe Texas Coinitiative hosts several meetups — at least one meet-up each week — including the Houston Bitcoin meetup, an Ethereum meetup and an upcoming Houston Bit Business meetup: a meeting place specifically designed for Bitcoin entrepreneurs.\n\nThe Texas Coinitiative invites speakers once or twice a month and is always looking for new speakers. Some of the speakers they’ve recently hosted include Bitcoin Core developer, Peter Todd; Changetip CEO, Nick Sullivan; and Ziftr CEO, Bob Wilkins.\n\n“The city of Houston is still very early in adoption phases in terms of Bitcoin,” says Adam Richard, president and co-founder of the Texas Coinitiative. “There aren’t many merchants that accept bitcoin here. We want to help grow that.”\n\nThe Embassy is also spearheading an educational project led by Jay Campuzano of Yo Soy Bitcoin, a series of educational video courses on Bitcoin for beginners in both English and Spanish.\n\nIn order to grow, the Texas Coinitiative is looking for sponsors.\n\n“The help from sponsors,” says Richard, “will be used for anything from food and drinks for events to printing of educational materials; all for the purpose of education and inspiring others to become more involved in the Houston Bitcoin ecosystem.”\n\nThe Houston Bitcoin Embassy currently has vacancies for anyone interested in an incubation/ coworking space.\n\nThe Texas Coinitiative will have a booth at tomorrow’s upcoming Texas Bitcoin Conference. It encourages attendees to visit the booth and talk to any of its representatives there.\n\n“We want to put Houston on the map in the Bitcoin space,” says Richard. “Houston has a lot going on that people don’t realize. There are currently 12 local Bitcoin startups in the city.”\n\nThe Houston Bitcoin Embassy is open Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nFor more information about the Houston Bitcoin Embassy, visit their website, send them an email, or sign up to attend the Houston Bitcoin meetup at meetup.com.', ""Note: The following article was submitted as part of the Ziftr contest and chosen as the winner on the topic of 'What will it take for Bitcoin to gain mass acceptance?'\n\nAlthough nobody knows for certain what the future holds for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole, it is almost unanimous among pundits and prognosticators that the Blockchain technology is here to stay.\n\nThere is little doubt that cryptocurrency will play a significant role in our lives within the next 5 to 10 years; in a recent Wall Street Journal poll “83% of those surveyed believe, “there is a future for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.”\n\nBut what will that digital landscape look like? Which coins will succeed and which coins will fade away into cyber obscurity? While it would be impossible to predict the destiny of the more than 500 cryptocurrencies currently on the market, the top three, bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin are traveling along a path where their roles are coming into focus.\n\nBitcoin: digital gold\n\nMost cryptocurrency experts will tell you that Bitcoin is destined to be the dominant digital currency used in internet commerce for the foreseeable future; but I see a different future for Bitcoin. The vast majority of people currently purchasing it are holding it as a speculative investment instead of spending it like a currency. According to a 2014 Forbes article by Samantha Sharf, “over 90% of bitcoins are hoarded.”\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto created the currency, he designed it to mimic the scarcity of gold. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist and since the block reward will dwindle to just 0.78 BTC by 2032, it will inevitably lead to even more hoarding.\n\nBecause bitcoin has a fixed supply it is deflationary by design, therefore the longer coins are held the greater the buying power they should have. How many times have we all heard stories of people who mined or purchased a large number of bitcoins when they were almost worthless that now own hard drives that are literally worth many times their weight in gold?\n\nBecause of this most people primarily view bitcoin as an investment vehicle to drive them down the road to wealth and prosperity rather than an instrument for facilitating retail transactions.\n\nBitcoin is becoming exactly what it was created to be - the digital version of gold. It is mined like gold, it is scarce like gold, and it can’t be counterfeited like gold only easier to store and transfer.\n\nLitecoin\n\nSo does this mean litecoin will become the dominant currency for e-commerce with conformation times that are four times faster than Bitcoin? Like bitcoin, litecoin is also a deflationary currency and even though it has a larger supply limit of 84 million compared to Bitcoin‘s 21 million, it also mimics gold and is still mainly held as an investment rather than spent like a currency.\n\nWith a per coin value that is roughly 1/15 the price of bitcoin, litecoin is a poor man’s bitcoin and the equivalent of digital silver to bitcoin’s digital gold. Just as silver attracts many investors so does litecoin, but investors are not consumers and if a currency is going to be a currency it needs to be spent by consumers.\n\nDogecoin\n\nThis is where I believe Dogecoin comes in. At the moment most people who purchase significant amounts of dogecoin are also buying it as an investment, but after cryptocurrencies achieve mass acceptance and their prices go up, dogecoin holders will spend it freely instead of hoarding it.\n\nThis is because, unlike bitcoin and litecoin, dogecoin is not deflationary since its supply is uncapped; therefore after its price peaks the declining yearly inflation rate currently 5.256% (4% in 2019, 3.4% in 2025 and 2.5% by 2035 etc.) will keep pace with economic growth and cause the coin’s value to remain stable.\n\nA stable price will encourage people to spend dogecoin instead of hoarding it in hopes that the coin will keep going up in value forever. Having an uncapped supply also keeps transaction fees low since miners will always be rewarded and have an incentive to process transactions and keep the network secure.\n\nThese features are all conducive for dogecoin to emerge as the frontrunner in facilitating retail transactions. In the future, I believe that both bitcoin and litecoin will continue to be held mainly as a digital gold and digital silver investment while dogecoin will become the new digital dollar.\n\nBy Dwain Findlay\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

As Skonieczny has found a new location, however, he intends to continue the original embassy, meaning that Amsterdam now supposedly hosts two different Bitcoin Embassies.\n\nThe history of the (original) Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam is only a couple of months old. The project was first announced in September of 2014 by then partners at the Dutch BTM-collective Mr. Bitcoin, Skonieczny, and Wismeijer, who were soon joined by the third main co-founder Rommes. The trio found a suitable location for the embassy towards the end of the year, as they were permitted to set up shop in the Bitcoin friendly café Hofje van Wijs. The Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam was sponsored by the Polish bitcoin exchange BitBay as well as Polish IT-company Rublon for about 700 euro, while individual bitcoin enthusiasts and companies could apply for a paid membership.\n\nAccording to Wismeijer, matters started to turn for the worse when Skonieczny – better known in the Dutch Bitcoin community under his alias Marek Skorek, refused to provide others involved with the embassy with any financial accountability regarding the sponsorship money. Although these funds were supposed to be controlled through a shared multisig Bitcoin wallet, Skonieczny never set this wallet up, and instead claimed that much of the money was spent on embassy related expenses.\n\nOn top of that, Wismeijer and Rommes were increasingly disgruntled with Skonieczny's policy at the embassy, such as his promotion of nonexistent events and the undemocratic method of decision-making. Additionally, Wismeijer and Skonieczny parted ways professionally as Skonieczny left Mr. Bitcoin for undisclosed reasons.\n\nThe Beginning of The End\n\nWhat finally lit the fuse, was an interview Skonieczny gave to CoinTelegraph last January. Referring to a controversial court case regarding the financial status of Bitcoin in the Netherlands, Skonieczny presented the Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam as “a screen against the [Dutch Bitcoin] Foundation,” while espousing severe – and in part rather unfounded – critique on the monthly Bitcoin Wednesday meetup in Amsterdam, and the Dutch bitcoin brokerage Bitonic. This event was to the dismay of Wismeijer and Rommes, who say to aim for a constructive approach with other members of the Dutch Bitcoin community.\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph, Wismeijer said: “It is as if Skonieczny is willingly trying to cause a rift in our small community. This is not something we support at all. We'd rather focus our energy on building a community rather than breaking it down.”\n\nThe climax of this story happened earlier this month. On the sixth of March, Skonieczny was formally banned and suspended – or perhaps excluded – as a member of the Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam. The embassy was re-branded as – or perhaps replaced by – the Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam Association by Wismeijer and Rommes. (Whether the “old” embassy is re-branded or replaced depends on who you ask).\n\nSkonieczny ignored the letter notifying him of this decision however and showed up at an event at the Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam two days later. In response, Wismeijer and Rommes called the police and had Skonieczny removed from the premise entirely. Subsequently, seemingly shocked, Skonieczny lingered in front of the café for a while, speaking to attendees at the event who were just arriving or smoking a cigarette outside. These actions were in turn met with another notification of Wismeijer and Rommes to the police, who now told Skonieczny to leave the street in front of the café in its entirety.\n\nSkonieczny met all of this with even more astonishment, he says. “I really don't understand what the problem is,” he told CoinTelegraph. “Although it is true that I have not yet created a multisig wallet for the sponsorship funds, this is only because no one has stepped up to the plate to fulfill any sort of official function within the Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam as I suggested right when we opened in December. Moreover, all of the funds are accounted for, either because I kept the receipts of the expenses I made or because it's right there on the blockchain.”\n\nSkonieczny, moreover, is not planning to sit idly by as “his” embassy is taken over – or perhaps replaced – by Wismeijer and Rommes. Directly after he was banned from the Hofje van Wijs, Skonieczny was invited by the owner of an Argentinian restaurant right across the street to establish a new – or perhaps continue the existing – Bitcoin embassy.\n\n“It wouldn't make sense to just stop running the Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam. We have members, we have sponsors, we have funds, and now we even have a new location. And in a way, having several Bitcoin embassies might even make a lot of sense, as it highlights the decentralized nature of Bitcoin itself. Plus, competition is healthy.” -- Marek Skonieczny\n\nWismeijer remains skeptical of the “new” Bitcoin Embassy, however: “There is only one real Bitcoin embassy in Amsterdam, and Skonieczny is not a part of it. The Dutch Bitcoin community deserves better than him.”\n\nAdding: “I just hope we can leave all of this trouble behind us, and start playing a constructive and fruitful role in the Dutch Bitcoin community.”\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

But, when was the last time you heard about a fiction based on bitcoin?\n\nIf you are an avid book reader, then not long ago I suppose. There is one such book titled “God is a Gamer” that mixes right amount of facts with fiction to be a worthy read. I hadn’t really given this book much thought until recently. I decided to give it a try, so I picked up a copy and started reading. Four hours of continuous reading and I didn’t regret it. I found it pretty impressive. God is a Gamer is authored by Ravi Subramanian, a banker turned writer and published by Penguin Books India. Ravi has over 20 years of experience in the financial services industry and it is clearly visible in his writing. The central theme in most of his books revolve around banks and bankers. Even God is a Gamer, claimed to be the world’s first bitcoin thriller doesn’t fall far from the tree.\n\nTo give you an insight to the story – The book opens with few actual events like Russia setting up National Payment Card System (NPCS), WikiLeaks and its adoption of bitcoin after other payment gateways stopped their services. The story is set in India and United States, involves assassination of an US Senator, FBI’s investigation that leads to Cotton Trail (sounds like Silk Road) and then comes the India connection with the domestic operations of an international bank being the target of multiple scams including a couple of murdered employees and so on. Bitcoin remains the central theme of the story from the beginning until the end.\n\nRavi has made a conscious effort to include everything about bitcoin (especially the darker side) into the story, diluting the plot in few places (or at least that is what I felt). In spite of that, it is a great read. The main protagonist in the story Varun, who isn’t introduced until you finish the first few pages, is a part-time drug dealer and a creative genius. Varun turns out to be more than that, thanks to his connections in the deep web. A master of deception who gets everyone to play their part just the way he wants them to. After all, revenge is a dish best served cold.

Comprehensive data given to FTfm has shown that a large number of LGPS pension funds may be squandering millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on excessive fees to fund managers. The data, which examine investment costs as a percentage of assets under management, highlighted the £656m Waltham Forest pension fund as the worst offender. It spent £7.5m (1.14 per cent of its assets) on investment costs last year. The £1.38bn Swansea pension fund spent £11.6m (0.84 per cent of assets), while the £1.34bn Shropshire pension fund spent £10.6m (0.79 per cent of assets). John Clancy, the Birmingham City councillor who compiled the data, said any spend above 0.4 per cent of assets was “absolutely dreadful”. “I really cannot speculate as to how they could possibly defend [these costs],” he said. David Blake, professor of pension economics at London’s Cass Business School, described the figures as “shocking”. He said: “The average local authority pension fund size is £2.3bn and one would expect that funds of this size could negotiate much lower fees. Even more disturbing is the range of fees, from 1.14 per cent to virtually nothing. Council taxpayers who underwrite these costs are getting a very bad deal, indirectly paying extortionate fees to the fund managers of those schemes.” FTfm analysis of the pension funds’ annual reports showed that the high level of fees often did not translate into better performance. Many funds with a similar size and asset class mix paid very different fees for near identical performance. The £765m Hammersmith and Fulham pension fund, for example, spent £4.9m on investment costs last year and achieved a 6.4 per cent return. The £775m Enfield pension fund spent just £1.3m on investment costs for an identical return. Similarly the £4.9bn London Pension Funds Authority spent £32m on investment costs and returned 6.1 per cent. The £5.7bn Tyne and Wear pension fund by comparison spent £8.8m on investment costs for a 5.2 per cent return. Michael Johnson, research fellow at the Centre for Policy Studies, the think-tank, questioned the aptitude of the trustees and investment consultants who oversee the funds. He said: “The whole governance framework is laughable. Many of the individuals involved lack the ability to ask penetrating questions and demand useful answers. The LGPS is in a bloody mess [given] the complete breakdown in governance and the deeply entrenched vested interests.” John Ralfe, an independent pension consultant, agreed that the funds are poorly managed, largely because many are overinvested in expensive active fund managers. He said: “It is all part of the LGPS being dysfunctional.” Edmund Truell, chairman of the LPFA, said in response that “the costs of investment are far too high across the [local government funds]”. He added that since he became chairman of the LPFA in 2013, it has stopped working with the consultants and most of the senior executive team that presided over the previous investment arrangements. Kieran Quinn, chairman of the £13.2bn Greater Manchester pension fund, which spent just under 0.1 per cent (£12.9m) of its assets on fees last year, admitted there are serious governance concerns at many local authority funds. He said: “[There are] enough examples of schemes that have not challenged their asset managers sufficiently to get the fee levels that are relevant. The issue is about basic governance. “If somebody is paying excessive money for failure then it is absolutely right that both the people receiving the cheques and the people paying the cheques need to be challenged.”', 'Remember the customers carrying bundles of cash who queued up last September to buy as many iPhones as Apple would sell them?\n\nIt could happen again.\n\n“We saw this with the iPhone,” said Asymco’s Horace Dediu in a podcast recorded Thursday. “We’ll see it in spades with the gold Apple Watch.”\n\nMost analysts expect demand will be strongest for Apple’s aluminum and steel watches, which start at $349 and $549, respectively. Dediu believes Wall Street may be underestimating the intangible appeal of a $10,000 gold watch. Especially one given as a gift. Especially in China, with its rich tradition of over-the-top gift giving.\n\nThe gold watch has something else going for it. Unlike the value of a Rolex, say, which can range from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands, the price of the Apple Watch in each of its global markets is fixed; it’s listed on the website.\n\n“It’s like currency,” says Dediu. Factor in local taxes, and you can calculate with some precision what he calls the “global arbitrage opportunities.”\n\nFor example, the entry level gold watch — 38mm 18-Karat Rose Gold with a white sport band — retails in the U.S. for $10.000. The same watch is listed on Apple’s Chinese website for RMB 74,800 ($12,045). Beijing imposes a 17% value added tax. Hong Kong does not.\n\n“If someone smuggles one of these into China,” says Dediu, “they’ll pay for their flight ticket and then some.”\n\nHe reports that in Boston there were still queues for the iPhone 6 Plus in January, almost five months after it launched. “They’re mostly Chinese,” he says. “They’re doing it as a business.”\n\nIt can be a rough business, as a documentary film shot outside Apple Stores in New York City last September demonstrated. It might be even rougher in April, when buyers could be carrying bundles of cash in units of $10,000.\n\nThat’s cash that will go almost directly to Apple’s bottom line. Dediu estimates that the margin on a $10,000 gold watch could be as high as 90%.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if in the first few months the demand for gold is far, far higher than we imagined,” he says. “They’ll just be out of stock, permanently.”\n\nON THE OTHER HAND: 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman, with good sources in Apple retail, says there will be no lines for the gold Watch.\n\nNo Waiting In Line: Unlike stainless steel Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport customers, those seeking to buy the Apple Watch Edition will not have to wait in a line. Sources say that potential Edition buyers will have priority access to assistance, effectively skipping the line of other waiting customers. Experts will be able to help a couple of customers try-on Watches simultaneously, unlike standard employees who will simultaneously help as many stainless steel and Sport customers as necessary.\n\nFollow Philip Elmer-DeWitt on Twitter at @philiped.

The world’s largest asset manager ended up holding 20.8 per cent of Monadelphous Group, above the 20 per cent threshold that requires an investor to make an offer for the whole company under Australian stock market rules, after a one-day buying spree. A series of BlackRock entities bought 8.6m shares in Monadelphous, pushing the share price up 25 per cent, on March 20, the day the Perth-based company was demoted from the S&P/ASX 100 index of blue-chip stocks under a quarterly rebalancing. In a filing to the Australian Securities Exchange, BlackRock admitted it had no intention of buying more than 20 per cent of the company. In a statement to FTfm, BlackRock laid the blame with unnamed third-party index providers that compile the benchmarks underlying some of its dividend income funds. It claimed these providers had seriously underweighted Monadelphous for two years, meaning BlackRock had to buy a lot more stock when this error was corrected. “Monadelphous’s stock was reweighted across multiple indices by major index providers on March 20, correcting for previous mis-underweightings, which led to this stock’s exposure more than doubling in some indices. As a result, the firm rebalanced its weightings in line with this correction, resulting in the firm briefly owning more than 20 per cent of the stock,” BlackRock said. “Our internal controls identified the issue, we reported it to the regulator and disclosed it to the market and the company. We also sold down our position by less than 1 per cent to take us below the 20 per cent threshold.” 20% Threshold requiring an offer for the whole company under Australian stock market rules The incident is the latest in a series of skirmishes with regulators for BlackRock. Earlier this month it was handed a record €3.25m fine by Bafin, Germany’s financial regulator, for misrepresenting its stakes in many of the country’s largest companies. BlackRock said it approached Bafin “regarding previously disclosed voting rights disclosures” that were either incorrect or late. In September 2014, it had restated its holdings in 48 German companies and amended information on its voting rights. 20.8% BlackRock’s holding in Monadelphous after buying 8.6m shares in a one-day spending spree Last year Consob, the Italian regulator, fined the US fund house €150,000 for market manipulation. Consob said BlackRock provided a “false and misleading” statement during the eurozone sovereign debt crisis in late 2011 when it erroneously said it had cut its stake in UniCredit shortly before the bank launched a rights issue. Investors took fright after BlackRock seemingly sold off large parts of its stake in UniCredit. Consob said the false information was provided by two employees at BlackRock Investment Management UK.']"
03/29/2015,"['As I expressed in yesterday’s Part 1 of this article, called “Can Bitcoin Exchange Risk Lead to Bitcoin Regulation?“, Bitcoin is far from perfect, and the Bitcoin exchanges are a primary concern right now. Over the last year, they have generated nothing but negative press for getting hacked, for closing, or being outright “Ponzi schemes”. This issue needs to be addressed within the community, and potentially outside of the community.\n\nNo one has been able to show where Bitcoin itself is a problem, quite the opposite. Bitcoin successfully solves many problems that plague other currency payment systems today. It dramatically cuts costs of using the now antiquated remittance system of Western Union. The costs of sending money overseas has now been effectively dropped by over 90%, regardless of what part of the world you are accessing (Western Union fees vary based on country.) And things like identity theft will also become a thing of the past, as the transactions only feature a public key and amount sent, with no personal information included. The users’ security is never compromised, and that is a benefit Visa and Mastercard do not offer and cannot offer.\n\nWhat is the Real Problem with Bitcoin Regulation?\n\nThis is the heart of the problem with the idea of Bitcoin regulation. Nation-states and regulators want control and regulation, not to protect consumers. Target, Home Depot, and JP Morgan Chase lost tens of millions of consumers’ personal information and financial account information to hackers within the last two years. Have regulations changed for them? In the case of JP Morgan, regulators are looking for ways to take away privacy measures for consumers, not enhance it. For Visa or Mastercard? For banks or large retailers holding millions of consumers information and financial account information? No, it is business as usual. No special license that restricts business has even been proposed like BitLicense was for Bitcoin in New York. These giants of industry, which tens of millions trust every year to protect consumer information haven’t proven to be “Too big to fail”, just too big to regulate.\n\nThe issue here is the playing field is not level for everyone. In fact, it is the exact opposite. Major corporations get a pass when security issues arise, or even when federal laws are broken. Bitcoin does not, even though it is “not legal tender”. If it is not “legal tender”, where is the legal or moral ground to regulate it as such? Ethically, any government cannot have it both ways. They contradict themselves on this issue. It would be more ethical, and more honest, if a government banned it out of fear that “The People” will trust an algorithmic currency over the Monopoly-money fiat currency system currently in use. Russia is banning Bitcoin, and in doing so hides behind the narrative that Bitcoin is used by terrorists. So Rubles and U.S. Dollars are not used by terrorists? People buy guns, commit crimes and build bombs with dollars and rubles, but that’s fine? These politicians must think we are stupid. Banning is fear of a superior currency, not fear of terrorism. Terrorism certainly wasn’t invented on January 3rd, 2009\n\nBitcoin itself does pose a serious threat, but it’s not to the users. It is a threat to the status quo, to the establishment, and to anyone who does not engage in sound money principles, like central banks, which control national governments. Being better threatens people, in government, and in any walk of life.\n\nAlso read Can Bitcoin Exchange Risk Lead to Bitcoin Regulation?\n\nCan Regulators be Trusted?\n\nTaking into account that when major corporations have tens of millions of user’s accounts compromised, on multiple occasions, and no regulation or punishment is metered out, the question is where does regulation actually start to come into effect? It’s obvious regulating Wall Street is not an option, after the 2008 economic collapse. The barons of Wall Street get to run amuck and spit in the face of any and all laws on the books. Target and Home Depot and JP Morgan are also above the law when it comes to protecting consumers. HSBC and Wachovia helped launder hundreds of billions of dollars for Mexican drug cartels over the course of many years. After a small fine, and 19,000 money laundering violations that a federal crimes which require trials and jail time, they walk away not only free from persecution but making a handsome profit on their criminal activity. Regulators missed that, too. What they would like to get in front of is Bitcoin, which as a currency has never hurt a consumer.\n\nFor example, it seems that regulators big idea on how to improve security for Bitcoin users is for Bitcoin users to add their identity to every transaction. This is so pathetic that it is laughable. One, this introduces identity theft into the equation where it does not exist. Two, it makes Bitcoin harder and more inconvenient to use. Three, it doesn’t solve any known problem with Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin current problems may include sending Bitcoin to the wrong address by mistake, or not getting a product after sending a payment. These problems can be solved without compromising user security with every online transaction. That hasn’t worked with debit card transactions, so why would it work with digital currency transactions? This goes back to my point about are regulators trust-worthy. This would help regulators be regulators, but it wouldn’t help consumers at all. It would hurt consumer protection. Bitcoin sends the public key and the amount. That’s by design, and far superior to anything currently in mainstream use. If regulators wanted to help someone, get the mainstream to copy Bitcoin’s superior system.\n\nBitcoin exchanges have hurt thousands of consumers, not millions like the American corporations I just mentioned, but Bitcoin exchange risk needs to be addressed. Just not be American regulators, who have proven to be derelict in their duties, and potentially corrupted into protecting the established players from innovative new players. Regulators, like central banks, also seem to operate with no accountability or oversight. They missed all the crimes I’ve already mentioned, and nothing happens to them. I don’t even know if anyone bothered to fire anyone, change a name of a non-working regulatory body or new laws passed against potentially corrupt regulators.\n\nRegulations in the United States, much like central banking anywhere, is a joke. They attack he smallest home business or innovative new industry but ignore the biggest fish with the most influence, power, and consumers under management. This is the exact opposite of their intended function. They are not protecting consumers. They are protecting the establishment from having competition or having to innovate. This is why you are still using debit cards designed in the 1950’s today, in 2015. Regulators don’t do their job, even after countless instances where market leaders, in multiple industries, are taking advantage of consumers, not protecting them.\n\nWho knows if Target, Home Depot, or JP Morgan weren’t in on those identity theft heists? We assume they aren’t, but who really knows? No regulator does. If there are no repercussions, what’s to stop a major inside job from taking place? Why should anyone trust any regulatory body at this point? It’s like trusting a central bank. They look after themselves, have no oversight, and have not done anything that they have sworn to do.\n\nA Regulation Can Help, Under Certain Circumstances\n\nA regulation can help improve trust in the digital currency industry. Look at the FDIC in banking. This is a PRIVATE corporation that insures bank account holders against theft or bank closure up to $250k per account. This PRIVATE sector corporation may have been commandeered by the government, but things that work best come from the private sector nine times out of ten. Bitcoin exchanges need oversight, preferably from within the Bitcoin community. And they work like fiat currency banks do, so a system like the FDIC insurance program would help a lot.\n\nGovernment regulation has proven incompetent, potentially corrupt, and out of control nine times out of ten. Regulators can’t be trusted and don’t even understand the digital currency industry to begin with. How will you regulate what you don’t understand?\n\nMaybe outside of the U.S. regulations have a much better track record. I would be all for regulation if it were fair, effective, and accountable. In the U.S., these objectives have not been hit for a long, long time. Micromanage the identity theft issue that plagues almost 5% of all debit card users. Get that under control first. Then look at Bitcoin.\n\nRegulators know what Bitcoin is. The innovative currency that protects consumers from identity theft, inflation, predatory remittances charges, and banking fees worldwide. The currency that the world should be working to emulate, not be attacked with torches and pitchforks by the minions of The State, to protect the establishment’s thiefdom instead of consumers’ interests. The Bitcoin community and private industry can solve any current Bitcoin problems. Regulators, with their track record, have proven that they can only make things worse.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Wikimedia Commons.\n\nCan the Bitcoin community get exchanges under control?

Share above and comment below!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Nathan Jessop is an analyst at Elliptic, a full-service Bitcoin custodian for investment funds and trading houses.\n\nSince 2008, bitcoin adoption has been influenced by a diverse range of factors that have made it one of the most volatile currencies in the world. Yet, despite such volatility, more than 100,000 bitcoin transactions are taking place per day and the volume continues to grow due to the ‘permissionless innovation’ provided by bitcoin’s underlying technology, the blockchain.\n\nAs the blockchain matures, bitcoin will increasingly resemble traditional financial services, with functions such as retail banking (Circle), exchanges (Coinbase) and payment processors (bitnet) being created. But how did it all start off, and where will it go next? Here, we take a brief overview of the major milestones in the cryptocurrency’s brief history and look to where it might be headed in the future.\n\nAugust 2008\n\nThree individuals, Neal Kin, Vladimir Oksman, and Charles Bry file an application for an encryption patent application. All three individuals deny having any connection to Satoshi Nakamoto, the alleged originator of the Bitcoin concept. The three also register the site Bitcoin.org in the same month, over on anonymousspeech.com – which allows people to buy domain names anonymously.\n\nOctober 2008\n\nDespite the above, Satoshi Nakamoto releases his white paper, revealing his idea for a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash to the world. In his vision, he manages to solve the problem of money being copied, providing a vital foundation for Bitcoin to grow legitimately.\n\nJanuary 2009\n\nThe first block, nicknamed ‘Genesis’ is launched allowing the initial ‘mining’ of Bitcoins to take place. Later that month, the first transaction takes place between Satoshi and Hal Finney, a developer and cryptographic activist.\n\nOctober 2009\n\nBitcoin receives an equivalent value in traditional currencies. The New Liberty Standard established the value of a Bitcoin at $1 = 1,309 BTC. The equation was derived so as to include the cost of electricity to run the computer that created the Bitcoins in the first place.\n\nFebruary 2010\n\nThe world’s first Bitcoin market is established by the now defunct dwdollar.\n\nMay 2010\n\nA programmer living in Florida named Laslo Hanyecz sends 10,000BTC to a volunteer in England, who spent about $25 to order Hanyecz a pizza from Papa John’s. Today that pizza is valued at £1,961,034 and stands as a major milestone in Bitcoin’s history.\n\nAugust 2010\n\nBitcoin is hacked. A vulnerability in how the system verifies the value of Bitcoin is discovered, leading to the generation of 184 billion Bitcoins. The value of the currency – from a high of $0.80 to $1 in June drops through the floor.\n\nOctober 2010\n\nBitcoin goes under the spotlight. After the hack in August – and a subsequent discovery of other vulnerabilities in the blockchain in September – an inter-governmental group publishes a report on money laundering using new payment methods. Bitcoin, it suggested could help people finance terrorist groups.\n\nNovember 2010\n\nBitcoin reaches $1 million. Based on the number of Bitcoins in circulation at the time, the valuation leads to a surge in Bitcoin value to $0.50/BTC.\n\nJanuary 2011\n\nThe Silk Road, an illicit drugs marketplace is established, using Bitcoin as an untraceable way to buy and sell drugs online.\n\nFebruary 2011\n\nBitcoin reaches parity with the US dollar for the first time. By June each Bitcoin is worth $31 giving the currency a market cap of $206 million.\n\nJune 2013\n\nThe first major theft takes place. Bitcoin Forum founder allinvain reports having 25,000 BTC taken from his digital wallet, which had an equivalent value of $375,000. In the same month, a major breach of security sees the value of the currency go from $17.51 to $0.01 per Bitcoin.\n\nMarch 2013\n\n\u200bThe US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) issues some of the world’s first bitcoin regulation in the form of a guidance report for persons administering, exchanging or using virtual currency. This marked the beginning of an ongoing debate on how best to regulate bitcoin.\n\nMarch 2013\n\nBitcoin market capitalisation reaches $1bn.\n\nAugust 2013\n\nFederal Judge Mazzant claims: “It is clear that Bitcoin can be used as money” and “It can be used to purchase goods or services” in a case against Trendon Shavers, the so-called ‘Bernie Madoff of bitcoin’. Bloomberg begins testing bitcoin data on its terminal. Although alternative tickers exist, endorsement from Bloomberg gives bitcoin more institutional legitimacy.\n\nNovember 2013\n\nBitcoin price climbs to $700 in as the US Senate holds its first hearings on the digital currency. The Federal Reserve chairman at the time, Ben Bernanke, gives his blessing to bitcoin. In his letter to the Senate homeland security and government affairs committee, Bernanke states that bitcoin “may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system”.\n\nDecember 2013\n\nChina’s central bank bars financial institutions from handling bitcoin transactions. This ban was issued after the People’s Bank of China said bitcoin is not a currency with “real meaning” and does not have the same legal status as fiat currency. The ban reflects the risk bitcoin poses to China’s capital controls and financial stability. Today China remains the world’s biggest bitcoin trader, with 80% of global bitcoin transactions being processed in China.\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nBitcoin custodians Elliptic launch the world’s first insured bitcoin storage service for institutional clients. All deposits are comprehensively insured by a Fortune 100 insurer and held in full reserve. This means Elliptic never re-invests client assets; instead they secure them in deep cold storage. Overstock.com becomes the first major online retailer to embrace bitcoin, accepting payments in the US. Overstock was the first in what is now an expeditiously growing list of large businesses that accept bitcoin.\n\nFebruary 2014\n\nHMRC classifies bitcoin as assets or private money, meaning that no VAT will be charged on the mining or exchange of bitcoin. This is important as it is the world’s first and most progressive treatment of bitcoin, positioning the UK government as the most forward thinking and comprehensive with regard to bitcoin taxation.\n\nJune 2014\n\nThe US government auctions off more than 29,000 bitcoins seized from the Silk Road, the illegal online marketplace. The sale and closure of the marketplace marks growing institutional understanding of the potential use cases of bitcoin. Additionally, the closure and auction of the Silk Road has helped bitcoin gain legitimacy as it demonstrates that bitcoin is not an easy way for online criminals to avoid the rule of law.\n\nFrom this point onwards bitcoin can no longer be considered as a currency for criminals. The use of the bitcoin blockchain means that the identity of users can often be established.\n\nJuly 2014\n\nThe ‘Bit Licence’ edges towards reality as the New York State Department of Financial Services releases the first draft of the agency’s proposed rules for regulating virtual currencies. The European Banking Authority publishes its opinion on ‘virtual currencies’. Their analytical report recommends that EU legislators consider declaring virtual currency exchanges as ‘obliged entities’ must comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing requirements.\n\nThe EBA report is important as it acts as a catalyst to launch bitcoin into the financial mainstream by highlighting the fact that virtual currencies require a regulatory approach to strive for an international coordination to achieve a successful regulatory regime.\n\nAlso that month GABI (Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund) launches the world’s first regulated Bitcoin Investment fund. This is important to the bitcoin ecosystem as the launch of this investment vehicle adds further legitimacy to bitcoin in addition to allowing regulated investors a way to invest in bitcoin.\n\nAugust 2014\n\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, demonstrates his and HM Treasury’s positive outlook on bitcoin when he purchases £20 worth of bitcoin and announces HM Treasury’s Call for Information on digital currencies, offering digital currency businesses the chance to comment on the risks and benefits and potentially influence future government policy.\n\nOctober 2014\n\nTeraExchange announces that the first bitcoin derivative transaction was executed on a regulated exchange, adding a new hedging instrument to bitcoin and instilling credibility and institutional confidence in the entire bitcoin community.\n\nDecember 2014\n\nTech giant Microsoft begins accepting bitcoin payments.\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange is a minority investor in Coinbase’s $75M funding round. The NYSE aims to tap into the new asset class by bringing transparency, security and confidence to bitcoin.\n\nMarch 2015\n\nThe results of the UK Treasury’s call for information on digital currency are announced.\n\nFuture predictions\n\nThere are several possible ways Bitcoin can go at this point, all of which point to a legitimate, widespread adoption by large institutions through tighter regulation. Recently, New York’s BitLicense became the world’s first digital currency-specific regulatory regime. It has been through a couple of rounds of consultations and is expected to come into force in a couple of weeks.\n\nThe European Central Bank and European Banking authority have both released detailed reports on digital currencies, and suggested regulation of the industry by the EU to further control price fluctuations. The Winklevoss brothers, they of Facebook fame, are on the verge of launching their own exchange-traded fund holding Bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin’s journey into the financial mainstream has already begun, with HM Treasury’s report on digital currencies marking encouraging progress toward the predictions in this infographic. The report introduces anti-money laundering, consumer protection and technical standardisation for digital currency companies in the UK, which will encourage traditional financial services to engage more with digital currency businesses and accelerate the integration of blockchain technology within financial services.\n\nRead Next: Why Bitcoin is changing how banks do business\n\nRead next: Why leaving your comfort zone can be so rewarding', 'Whenever we have any sort of tech related problem, we usually remember the name Houston. Fortunately, there is a new place in Houston, Texas provided by Cryptospaces that is jointly powered by FinalHash, a renowned Bitcoin consulting company. Situated at 6907 Almeda RD., this newly established Houston Bitcoin Embassy could be regarded as a joint-working place that is completely dedicated to tech startups. At the end of April, there is plan for setting up a Bitcoin ATM as an added facility.\n\nThe Houston Bitcoin Embassy is now known as the home for the Texas Coinitiative – a non-profit association that works for promoting Bitcoin use in Texas.\n\nThe Coinitiative mission statement:\n\n“We do have a belief that this growing community of ours will be able to assist for shaping progress in this sort of field. You are welcome to make networks and connections with traders, innovators and entrepreneurs through working in the most exciting technological and sociological innovations in the recent days.”\n\nThe Texas Coinitiative also arranges various meetups – a minimum of 1 meetup per week – including the Ethereum meetup, the Houston Bitcoin meetup and the forthcoming Houston Bit Business meetup – a meeting that is exclusively designed for the promising Bitcoin entrepreneurs.\n\nThe Texas Coinitiative always tries to manage the renowned business professionals to serve as speakers at the meetings in order to inspire the new Bitcoin developers and entrepreneurs. Some of the mentionable speakers they have recently picked up as hosts are Changetip CEO, Nick Sullivan; Bitcoin Core Developer, Peter Todd and Ziftr CEO, Bob Wilkins.\n\nThe Houston Bitcoin Embassy is also trying to implement a big initiative where they will promote an educational project that is led by Jay Campuzano of the Yo Soy Bitcoin. This project includes a series of video tutorials (available in English and Spanish) on Bitcoin for the beginners.', ""I came across a link about M-Pesa on the Bitcoin subreddit with the headline ‘Kenya's M-Pesa mobile payment service is beating bitcoin’. Being a Kenyan, who uses both the mobile money service and bitcoin, it made me think about how the two technologies compare.\n\nM-Pesa is perhaps the most told financial story to come out of Kenya. This is because many in the West find it almost unbelievable that more than a half the population of a country can rely solely on their simply-featured phones to receive, send, and even save money.\n\nIndeed, those rooting for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have received inspiration from this success. Perhaps because both of these ways of dealing with money are digital, some assume that they are competitors.\n\nThis perspective ignores the fact that it is feasible they can complement each other in this area, bringing financial services to the unbanked, especially in the developing world. An excellent example in this regard is Bitpesa, which facilitates locals to receive money in their M-Pesa accounts, which is remitted in the form of bitcoins from outside of the country.\n\nWhatever the case, Bitcoin and M-Pesa are fundamentally two distinct technologies.\n\nSingle point of vulnerability\n\nFirst and foremost, M-Pesa is and will remain a centralized solution from a corporate entity, which makes it vulnerable to single-point attacks. For instance, if some smart fellow hacked the server system, the damage that could be done can only be imagined.\n\nBeing a centralized platform does expose users to occasional system failures. When this has happened in the past, businesses and individuals have had their daily financial plans and activities ruined.\n\nOnce, a friend told me he thought that it was very risky that we as a country depend on a single business entity to handle close to 50% of money flow.\n\nOf course, that is not to say that Safaricom, the company behind the service, is not doing a good job in securing the system. The fact that it is centralized makes the risk all too real though.\n\nIt is important to mention that M-Pesa is not the only mobile money service in Kenya. All the other three telecommunication companies in the country have similar services. Safaricom just happens to be a very dominant player.\n\nOn its part, Bitcoin is service that will still work even if a disaster hit and destroyed half of the internet infrastructure. In fact, total failure is only possible if there is a total annihilation of what we know today as the internet.\n\nThe fee and privacy factors\n\nAnother factor that differentiates M-Pesa and Bitcoin are the fees charged on transactions. Currently, the former charges up to 6% of the value transacted. On the other hand, Bitcoin transaction fees are almost negligible, with the distance between the sender and the receiver not coming into play in this regard.\n\nIt’s also important to note that M-Pesa is a local closed system, while Bitcoin is decentralized and accessible worldwide.\n\nThe blockchain, the platform on which Bitcoin operates, is pseudo-anonymous. All your transactions are available for anyone on the network to see, but only if they know what public address belongs to you.\n\nThe same sort of issue happens with M-Pesa; records of your transactions are kept under your name and National Identification number. While, unlike on the blockchain, this information is not public, one thing that many people might not be comfortable with is the access that third parties have to it.\n\nThis is not only possible through a system security breach, but also through demands made by an authority such as the court, government agencies, or even other financial institutions.\n\nIndeed, taking everything into consideration, it is fair to state that M-Pesa is a huge improvement on what has been on offer. However, Bitcoin, through its decentralized blockchain platform, is a huge improvement on M-Pesa.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Users can modify this list, set specific payment amounts and subscribe to particular bitcoin addresses. Other features, including paywalls and in-app messaging, are also planned.\n\nEllis characterized the challenge of creating micropayments services as a behavioral one fraught with complications. Ellis is one of several individuals behind the World Crypto Network, and has worked on other projects such as feathercoin and the World Citizenship cryptographic passport.\n\nProTip is one of a growing number of digital currency micropayments options. This list includes AutoTip, which Ellis cited in an interview with CoinDesk. AutoTip utilizes meta tags when identifying wallets addresses on a Web page – a feature that Ellis said has been adopted by ProTip.\n\nServices like ChangeTip – a company that has faced criticism from the bitcoin community, as well as Ellis and others on the World Crypto Network for its centralized nature – have also proven to be popular with users looking to pledge small amounts of money to one another.\n\nEfforts to create micropayment platforms and channels date back to the early days of the Internet, but various attempts through the years failed to achieve long-term success or widespread adoption. Citing this history, Ellis said that any potential solution has to eliminate points of friction that might otherwise dissuade a user.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“The hypothesis is that we’ve solved that, because what we’ve done is we’ve batched up that decision point to once a week, because the tipping takes place every seven days.”\n\nDespite past failures with micropayment experiments, Ellis argued that online media can benefit from alternative forms of monetization in order to reduce dependence on third-party revenue and the need to create content that serves primarily to boost advertising revenue.\n\nChallenging behavior\n\nAccording to Ellis, one of the problems with micropayments is that those who would be paying may not feel entirely comfortable doing so. Cryptographer Nick Szabo called this hesitation the ""mental accounting barrier"" in a 1996 essay on micropayments.\n\n“Every time you make an economic decision, you make a cognitive decision. And any cognitive decision comes with a risk, and because you come at these risks you anticipate worlds where we don’t regret it later,” said Ellis.\n\nThe habits of those who create digital media could also poses challenges. The ProTip team has sought feedback during development from online artists, journalists and media creators, finding that some are apprehensive about the idea of using any kind of digital payment system due to the potential security risks. Others, said Ellis, voiced apprehension about bitcoin’s diverse online community as a whole.\n\n“It really is going to be give and take,” he concluded.\n\nEllis said that offering information about the aspects of bitcoin and how to use it work will help engage both digital media creators and consumers, citing that process as one of his major responsibilities as the team’s chief education officer.\n\nLaunch approaching\n\nDevelopment of the initial ProTip software is nearing completion, and Ellis said that private testing of the platform has already been underway for some time and that “people have been using it.”\n\nThe timeline for development of paywalls and in-app messaging between ProTip subscribers and content creators is contingent on the success of the project’s Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign. As of 27th March, ProTip has raised more than $6,000 in both bitcoin and fiat out of a goal of $50,000.\n\nAccording to Ellis, the plan is to make ProTip open source on 1st May, though he said that the development team isn’t rushing to release a project that isn’t ready for public use.\n\n“We’re also very cautious because we want to make sure that the bitcoins are safe, the private keys are safe,” he said.\n\nEllis suggested that the ProTip team has sought to be mindful of the expectations it creates about the project, noting:\n\n“We wanted to under-promise and over-deliver on this.”\n\nImages via ProTip, Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Every time a stock changed hands, a physical stock certificate had to be exchanged as well.\n\nBack then, the securities business relied on a cottage industry of old men, often retired police officers and firemen, chomping cigars in trench coats as they schlepped valises, suitcases and even steamer trunks full of stock certificates—or bearer bonds, or cash—to and fro in lower Manhattan, in New York’s financial district. If a courier was out on the street with a particularly valuable suitcase, the risk manager—he was not a spreadsheet jockey, but rather the guy who managed the metal cage holding the firm’s valuable documents and cash—would ask the other couriers to sit tight until the transaction “cleared” and the other side of the trade was safely back in the bank.\n\nThe growth in stock trading in prosperous post-World War II America, and the burgeoning financial sector’s own ambitions, eventually overwhelmed exchanges and brokers. In 1969, a firm that was later folded into Merrill Lynch employed 600 people just to manage stock certificates.\n\nThe whole, paper-based system left plenty of room for mix-ups and foul play, resulting in missed trades, brokerage failures, market shutdowns, and theft. According to a New York Times report from the era, up to $400 million in lost or stolen securities were reported between 1967 and 1970—in 2015, that would be equal to $2.8 billion, adjusting for inflation. In 1967, a 22-year-old stock clerk was indicted for stealing $900,000 in IBM stock certificates—a cool $6.3 million in today’s dollars.\n\nI’ve got yours in here somewhere. (AP Photo/Dan Grossi)\n\nThe RAND Corporation, a policy research group, was called in to help solve the problem. Technology seemed to be the solution. Computerized punch cards soon began to take over the exchanges. But as late as 1973, financial advice columns urged people to take delivery of their stock certificates rather than leave them “in the street,” that is, in the hands of their brokers. When brokerages failed, any investments they still held for their customers would disappear, too.\n\nThis history echoes loudly in the recent failures of bitcoin exchanges and in the lost investments of users who kept their cryptocurrency “in the street”—in this case, on the ledgers of an exchange, rather than secured in their own bitcoin wallets.\n\nThese failures, however, weren’t due to paperwork problems, since the blockchain protocol behind bitcoin builds the record of a transaction into every transaction it executes.\n\nSo does that mean we’ve reached the end of our parable about 1960s Wall Street and its parallels to bitcoin? Of course not.\n\nTrust us\n\nWall Street’s big problem back then wasn’t actually solved with technological advances in bookkeeping, but with trust.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, the New York Stock Exchange had debuted a “central stock certificate system,” to deliver securities electronically. It was rudimentary, voluntary, and unreliable, but it formed the basis for the major breakthrough that would come in 1973: the creation of the Depository Trust Corporation. As its name indicated, the DTC required that all the players in the market rely on a single, centralized institution to hold, in 1973, 1.5 billion shares worth $55 billion.\n\nBitcoin, in contrast, is famously designed to be a “trust-less” payments system (pdf). It relies on an electronic ledger and a deliberately decentralized accounting system, giving users the ability to transact quickly, without intimate knowledge of the person on the other side of the exchange.\n\nThat hasn’t prevented a problem that plagued the paper-based Wall Street of yore: competing claims on ownership. As the Financial Times noted this week:\n\nIndeed, given the high volume of fraud and default in the bitcoin network, chances are most bitcoins have competing claims over them by now. Put another way, there are probably more people with legitimate claims over bitcoins than there are bitcoins. And if they can prove the trail, they can make a legal case for reclamation.\n\nThis has George Fogg, a lawyer with Perkins Coie who is cited in the FT piece, thinking about bitcoin’s relatively ambiguous treatment under the United States’ Uniform Commercial Code, and the role that a trusted intermediary might play. And as Fogg told the FT, the precedent for this dates back to Wall Street’s shift from delivery of paper stock certificates to centralized clearing.\n\nThere are a limited number of bitcoin in circulation, and a not-trivial amount has been exchanged in disputed transactions, whether robbed from troubled exchanges or seized by the government. Nonetheless, bitcoin users generally are not enthusiastic about that kind of centralization Fogg is suggesting.\n\nNothing new under the sun\n\nWatching the bitcoin market develop, you get an appreciation for why other financial systems developed the way they did.\n\nCompanies that help you buy bitcoin, hold it, and transact it: you might call them brokerages, or even banks. Deposit insurance? Bitcoin doesn’t have it yet, but there’s a clamoring for it every time an exchange fails and its customers are left with no recourse for their vanished wealth. And while bitcoin was designed to function without a central bank, the currency’s price volatility has some bankers recommending the creation of one.\n\nAnd now here we are, half a dozen years into bitcoin’s existence, talking about the potential value of centralized clearing.\n\nIt’s not criticism to say that the bitcoin financial system will likely adopt a number of the features of the current one—merely a reminder that those features tend to exist for good reason.', 'They call the Documentary Project – Life on Bitcoin. Every newly wed couple usually have a dream of how to spend their early days easing into married life. As with every generalisation, there is always an exception. A newly wed intrepid couple dream of putting themselves through the quest to live entirely using Bitcoin, for more than 100 days.\n\nLife on Bitcoin: Documentary\n\nThe teaser video for the documentary on Life on Bitcoin shows this young couple talking enthusiastically about this adventure. Just two weeks into their marriage and just off their honeymoon, Austin and Beccy Craig started their adventure. Let’s digress here a moment to say “Bravo” to this couple. They have been enthusiastically sharing their journey on Youtube generously.\n\nA Fiat Currency Scenario\n\nIt helps to see the ambitious nature of this challenge by wearing a different set of lenses. Here is an analogy to help understand the magnitude of this challenge, that this couple has willingly embraced to suffer. Living a life for 100+ days exclusively on & with Bitcoin can indeed get messy. Here is the imaginary proof.\n\nImagine yourself travelling to China or India and all that you have with you is US dollars, no RMB or Rupees with you. US Dollar is not the currency in India or China [Duh]. It is hard to appreciate money, when it is not accepted to be one! Along the same lines, imagine being in a prison, where cigarettes are a form of currency that can be traded for burgers or other services. In both these examples, there is often an exchange that can help convert currencies. But exchanging Bitcoin for fiat currency would defeat the purpose of the Life on Bitcoin Project. So, that is not an option. They got to live on Bitcoin, as in spend Bitcoin to buy stuff.\n\nIn the video, Beccy briefly talks about the perils of such a Life. Lets assume she gets pregnant, it would be a challenge to find clinics, drug stores and doctors who would understand (& accept) Bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nNearest Fuel Station — 100 Miles Away.\n\nFor something as simple as filling fuel in the vehicle, the couple needs to plan the travel and drive for several hours. All of this just to reach the nearest gasoline station, as the owner is adventurous enough to accept payment in Bitcoin.\n\nFew more scenarios in Life on Bitcoin, for our musing.\n\nBuying Lunch with Bitcoin, buying water, coffee, groceries, travel, flight ticket booking, hotels and restaurants, cell phone recharges and so on. Need we say more? It is hard to not see it. This is a challenge indeed. Wishing this couple good luck on this endeavour.\n\nOn a conclusory note, I have an idea to give away. If there is an entrepreneur reading this, here is the idea — there is potentially a business that can be built that bridges the gap between willingness to pay and the ability to buy with Bitcoin. I challenge undeniably that it is at this gap that the greater opportunities are hidden.', 'The Bitcoin price has jumped below the $250 mark and it has appeared to be dropping further since the selling orders were piled up on some primary exchanges. The market watchers consider this price falling as a significant psychological barricade for the price. According to the statistical data from different types of Bitcoin Price Index, it can be claimed that this changing of price can be a significant move of BTC.\n\nIt is important to be considered that a warning from the market watchers has also come that if the price does fall below $250, then there could be some noticeable changes in the Bitcoin market. Arthur Hayes from the BitMex firm wrote in his ‘Trading Newsletter’ that after the $250 price level, the $200 mark could be the upcoming resistance level in the BTC market.\n\nIt is true that the Bitcoin transaction system has not been that popular in the current time in case of simple transactions. But, the reason behind this is mainly the truth that the cryptocurrency transaction system is comparatively young. In order to increase the popularity of the Bitcoin transaction system, it is more than necessary that BTC should undertake different steps and implement those for the ease of the users. Many of the renowned companies have already started adopting the Bitcoin system, but the number of these companies need to increase.\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin Price Analysts, it can be said that the next move of BTC is to make the price level fall below $250 (could be $200). Actually, the strategies taken by BTC are highly appreciable since their improvement with the passage of time is certainly significant. This digital currency technology of the Bitcoin industry has a bright future all over the world due to its continuous improvements.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

It is a common question asked by newbies to bitcoin. The answer is bitcoin faucets, you will not get much out of it, but it is free nevertheless.\n\nBitcoin faucets, as the name suggests are like dripping faucets (taps)… but in this case, it is cryptocurrency units in place of water. Just as the leaking water takes some time to accumulate into a droplet before it drips, users have to wait for a certain duration before they could collect the accumulated coins.\n\nWhat are bitcoin faucets?\n\nBitcoin faucets (it can be for any cryptocurrency) are reward systems that dispenses rewards in the form of a tiny fraction of bitcoin for visitors to claim. These rewards are dispensed at certain intervals of time.\n\nWhy bitcoin faucets?\n\nRewards are in place to attract visitors to the faucet’s webpage. These faucet sites usually contain advertisements. Advertisers pay the faucet owner to display these ads on his site. Advertising costs are calculated on Cost per Thousand impression (CPM) basis. This means, if the site gets more visitors and if each visitor spends more time on the site, then the site owner gets more money from displayed ads. These rewards attract more visitors and they come back regularly to claim their rewards. The visitor generally ends up spending more time on the faucet.\n\nIn simple words — Faucets get more repeated visitors to the site; in turn, the owner gets more money from the advertisers.\n\nFaucets also play an important role in the bitcoin ecosystem. It encourages more people to understand and adopt bitcoin.\n\nWho uses bitcoin faucets?\n\nIf you understand bitcoin and how it works, then you will know in no time that the bitcoin units given away by faucets is of negligible value. You wouldn’t spend time claiming rewards on them. Majority of visitors who use these faucets and claim rewards from them are beginners, still learning about bitcoin or minors who cannot do transactions legally on any of the bitcoin exchanges.\n\nHow to use bitcoin faucets?\n\nUsing a bitcoin faucet is very simple. Once you visit the faucet webpage, you have to enter your bitcoin wallet address or the email id associated with your Xapo wallet and hit enter. A timer will start counting the amount of time you spend on the site. Once you spend a certain amount of time on the site, you can claim your reward by clicking the “Claim Now” or similar button. You will have to prove that you are a human by filling in a Captcha or by solving a simple mathematical problem, (this prevents any automated script from claiming rewards at regular intervals). That is it…! You have claimed your reward. Your reward will be credited either immediately or on a designated weekly payout day to your wallet.\n\nTypically, faucets have a minimum time interval limit between claims by each visitor, in order to prevent one person from claiming all the available bitcoin from faucet’s wallet. This duration varies from 5 minutes to 24 hours, depending upon the faucet.\n\nWhere can I find bitcoin faucets?\n\nYou can find them by just searching for Bitcoin Faucet on Google or any other search engine of your choice. The number of results you get will surprise you. You will find hundreds of bitcoin faucets to choose from, go ahead, explore and earn a few satoshis while at it. (1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC i.e. hundredth of a millionth BTC)\n\nHere are few bitcoin faucets you can explore:', 'Bitcoin is mostly an invention of America. Although no one knows much about Satoshi Nakamoto, but it is believed that Satoshi, in the initial phase, spoke and did work on Bitcoin in English. About 18 months ago, China started to experience the wondering taste of Bitcoin. Within a few months, China changed the condition of the market by driving over the amount of $1100. At that time, it created a huge impact in the Bitcoin market because the US had never faced such a kind of huge investment from a new currency.\n\nThe Government of China understood the shifting of the financial system in the markets and made the Bitcoin persona non grata while in the case of banking and regulatory sector. This sudden strategy taken by China is an example of the Chinese power on any sort of financial market within a very short period of time (a couple of months).\n\nBitcoin has never been considered as a threat to the national currency, rather it is always thought to be an online commodity for online financial transactions. Over the days of 2014 up until this very current day, China has managed to increase and maintain a huge market share in the digital currency market called Bitcoin. Different global financial data analysts also came to the same conclusion.\n\nAccording to the data collected from the global financial giant named Goldman Sachs, it can be said that about 80% of the total current Bitcoin transactions are being traded using the Chinese Yuan. From late 2013, China, using its tactical strategies, started to maintain almost 50% of the whole worldwide Bitcoin transactions. Basically, Bitcoin was primarily designed to be the most significant part of the future era of money and at present, China can definitely be considered as an important part of the future of Bitcoin.']"
03/30/2015,"[""Washington (CNN) The federal government became owners of one of the biggest troves of Bitcoin, thanks to seizing millions of dollars in the digital currency from criminals associated with the online black market Silk Road.\n\nTwo federal agents who helped lead one of several investigations in the case allegedly decided they wanted some of the money for themselves, according to a new federal court documents.\n\nThe two now-former agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Secret Service are charged with wire fraud, money laundering and other offenses for allegedly stealing Bitcoin during the federal investigation of Silk Road, an underground illicit black market federal prosecutors shut down in 2013.\n\nJUST WATCHED Police investigating incident at NSA Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police investigating incident at NSA 02:53\n\nThe charges in a criminal complaint filed in San Francisco federal court paints a picture of corrupt federal agents trying to enrich themselves as they tried to bring down one of the Internet's top cybercriminals.\n\nRead More"", 'In February, after a trial that lasted 13 days, Ross Ulbricht was convicted of running the online drug marketplace Silk Road, which utilized the digital currency bitcoin for its payments. The media coverage of the trial, and the final result, could be seen as bad for bitcoin. It fed into an image that many in the public still have of the currency: that it is unsafe, and is used for crime.\n\nBut while Ulbricht was the most prominent case thus far and is the reigning symbol of bitcoin’s darker uses (he even had the ominous alias “Dread Pirate Roberts”), a different defendant pleaded guilty to bitcoin-related crimes two months earlier than him: Charlie Shrem.\n\nShrem was no shadowy figure, operating in the dark. He was a known name and an early advocate in the bitcoin community. In 2011 he founded the bitcoin exchange BitInstant, which had a range of legitimate investors, including the Winklevoss brothers. But in January, 2014, he was arrested (in dramatic fashion, at New York’s JFK Airport) and, last April, charged with failing to report suspicious banking activity, laundering money from BitInstant accounts (some $1 million) for use by Silk Road customers, and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.\n\nThat latter charge is significant moving forward, as the New York Department of Financial Services is currently still at work revising BitLicense, its proposed set of regulations that will govern bitcoin businesses that are transmitting money on behalf of others. The Times wrote that Shrem, “has come to symbolize the government’s crackdown on the virtual currency,” but in fact, there has been, for now, very little crackdown, though some bitcoin supporters worry that it is on the way in earnest.\n\nWhile the salacious headlines that follow the prosecution of a bitcoin entrepreneur are unquestionably a negative for the community, some in that world see the prosecution itself as a positive sign. “Silk Road and [other crimes] are obviously a negative, but there’s a silver lining in the sense that when people do bad things and think they can do it because it’s in bitcoin, and they get arrested, there’s a message there that you’ll still get caught,” says Tyler Winklevoss. “What I take away from it is that traditional law enforcement tactics and measures are working, even in the bitcoin world. Technologies aren’t good or bad, they’re neutral. People use email for bad things, people use U.S. dollars for bad things.”\n\nShrem pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transmitting service, and was sentenced in December to two years in prison. Today, the 25-year-old reports to USP Lewisburg, in Lewisburg, Penn. It is a high-security federal prison, but Shrem will be in the minimum-security satellite camp. (If you suspect that Shrem will have a cushy time of it there, read our exclusive, revealing interview with a white-collar inmate at a minimum-security prison.)\n\nSince the moment he was sentenced, Shrem has been upbeat about his fate. On the day of sentencing, he tweeted: “Considering I was facing 30 years, justice has been served.” He then added that he was happy the judge in the case “admires my brainpower.” He has claimed as his own the title of bitcoin’s “first felon” and added the phrase to his Twitter bio, in which he also calls himself a “pioneer,” “crusader,” and “dreamer.”\n\nLast week, Shrem agreed to a phone interview with Fortune, but had to cancel. He has appeared on radio shows and spoken to the press, and discussed his expectations in an extensive blog post from earlier this month entitled, “So, I’m going to prison—reflections from bitcoin’s first felon.” In the post, Shrem writes, “I don’t look for sympathy, I did the crime and I will do the time.” He says that the prison facility where he’s headed “seems like a nice place, it offers outstanding recreational facilities including a walking track; a basketball court; softball fields and exercise equipment.” And on his Twitter account, he has appeared to even relish the imminent experience. On Sunday he posted a countdown (“21 hours until prison…”) and said, enthusiastically, “Follow my twitter when I check in to prison tomorrow! A few people will be running it, will post updates from behind the walls.”\n\nIn Shrem’s blog post, he recounts the many ways he remained involved in bitcoin in the past year, including while he was on house arrest. He served as a consultant to a couple bitcoin companies, made speeches, and met with venture capitalists. He remains a diehard bitcoin believer. It appears extremely likely that he will return to the bitcoin world the moment he emerges from prison. The question is where the technology will be by then, and how much the landscape will have changed—and whether increased regulation to guard against crimes like Shrem’s will have had a major impact.', 'One of the biggest misconceptions is Bitcoin is somehow not secure. Critics will point out that exchange failures are some inherent weaknesses in Bitcoin, and that it cannot be trusted as currency. Advocates point out that Bitcoin theft is very low when people manage their own Bitcoins, as creator Satoshi Nakamoto intended. Now, a true innovation is taking Bitcoin into an orbit near you.\n\nBitSat can handle Bitcoin’s Block Chain in Space\n\nBitSat is the brainchild of Jeff Garzik, founder of Dunvegan Space Systems that will enhance Bitcoin’s transactional security, plus the digital currencies own existence far into the future. Hard to be more secure than several miles above the Earth. With Bitsat, you can always have a Bitcoin node in space, just in case of any ground-based EMP attacks on computer systems on Earth, global computer viruses, or a nefarious third-party attacks the Internet or the Block Chain directly. With the FCC looking to co-opt the Internet into something the U.S. Government can micro-manage, without any real jurisdiction, the Internet’s future of freedom is less secure than ever before. This creates an insurance policy against “bad actors”, no matter where they come from on this planet. Garzik spoke to Vice Magazine about his plans for BitSat.\n\n“The way the bitcoin algorithm works, if 99 out of 100 connections to your [ground-based bitcoin machine] are malicious, that one honest connection will be discovered and honest data chosen over others,” Garzik said to VICE News. With small satellites holding computers in space, under the worst case scenario “bitcoin miners, payment processors, and other high-value sites will find value from having a guaranteed backup if the internet to their site is interrupted or under attack.”\n\nAlso read: BitGO’s Bitcoin Wallet Now Backed by World-Class Insurance\n\nBitcoin transactions have proven secure, as that is its encrypted core design trait, secure peer-to-peer transactions. The problems come from those who try to use or govern the technology, from exchanges, to governments, to the Internet itself. And people are not very good at protecting digital items. We’ve only been doing it for about 50 years, versus thousands of years protecting physical items, and we could be a lot better at it. There are weaknesses in all of these links in the chain that threaten Bitcoin, and where a BitSat can provide an out-of-this-world protected Bitcoin node for any emergencies which may come up. You can never be too careful with your Bitcoin, and someone with an anti-Bitcoin agenda coming from outer space is unlikely.\n\nAnother benefit of BitSat is the increased ability to send Bitcoin to remote locations in the Third World. There are still many places worldwide where the Internet and cellular phone service may not be available. With BitSat, those who live way off the grid can still have their Bitcoin. With a large satellite dish, a USB cable and some other equipment, you are fully connected to BitSat and the Bitcoin network. If all else fails, you can have a BitSat transaction node looking out for your Bitcoin. Increased security, an emergency backup node, and better access for people the world over. Sounds like a plan fit for a state-of-the-art digital currency.\n\nThis program is set to start next year, and a single BitSat launch only cost one million US Dollars (Twenty years ago, it was probably 100 times that much to launch a satellite). Bitsats are optimized for Bitcoin, the Block Chain, and other digital currencies, but can be configured for clients who need it for other Internet applications.\n\nThink of it as a future GPS system designed for the Bitcoin’s future. If the Internet goes down, for an hour or a month, your secure backup is amongst the stars.\n\nPhotos provided by Wikimedia Commons and Shutterstock.

FATF\'s proposal hopes to move the digital currency sector away from the current de-risking model which, according to industry insiders, has seen banks closing or denying bank accounts to bitcoin businesses, citing money laundering as a blanket term.\n\nThe policy maker discussed its plans at the plenary meeting to get the opinion of digital currency industry insiders.

(OTCQB:BTCS), a company that plans to build a universal digital currency platform with the goal of enabling users to engage in the digital currency ecosystem through one point of access.\n\nHighlights of the report include:\n\nBTCS is attempting to create a universal digital currency platform with one point of access; majority of digital currency competitors focus on one product inside the ecosystem. BTCS\'s business strategy, in a nutshell, is to create its own digital currency platform which allows consumers to access bitcoin through one point of access, as opposed to the vast majority of current bitcoin technology, which are single solution providers. Allowing an individual to access the bitcoin ecosystem through one access point would help make bitcoin more widely adopted, particularly among individuals that are less technologically savvy.\n\nBTCS has developed a series of strategic partnerships and investments to develop this ecosystem:\n\nWallet: Syndicate investor in Gem, which is developing a secure, cloud wallet storage technology\n\nATM: Lead investor in the seed round in Coin Outlet, a digital currency ATM manufacturer\n\nFinancial services: Lead investor in the bridge round in Expresscoin, a digital currency exchange with multiple payment options\n\nPayment processor: Lead investor in the Series A financing for GoCoin, a leading international digital currency payment platform\n\nRevenue currently generated through transaction verification services business, or digital currency mining. BTCS is currently generating revenue through its transaction verification services business. The Company recently obtained an 83,000 square foot facility in which to expand its transaction verification operations. BTCS also purchased additional servers from Spondoolies Tech Ltd., which has brought its total hash rate to 891 TH/s. The hash rate is the measuring unit of the processing power of the bitcoin network, and 1 TH is equivalent to 1,000,000,000,000 hashes per second. With minimal improvements, the Company\'s new facility is expected to be able to house up to 40,000 TH/s of transaction verification hardware. BTCS believes that its current capabilities give it the ability to earn at least 350 bitcoins in 1Q15, or $77,000 at today\'s bitcoin to dollar exchange rate. BTCS plans to expand its capacity beyond 10,000 TH/s and 10 megawatts, indicating that revenue from its transaction verification services business should increase significantly in the coming months.\n\nBTCS owns two bitcoin ATMs; plan to grow this business in conjunction with its partner Coin Outlet (BTCS is the lead investor in Coin Outlet). BTCS currently owns two BitXatms, which it plans to deploy and have operated by its partner Coin Outlet. BTCS is the lead investor in Coin Outlet and has the option to own up to 11.4% of Coin Outlet at a $6 million dollar valuation. Coin Outlet currently has 10 digital currency ATMs (9 in the U.S., 1 in Europe) in service and plans to expand to over 150 ATMs in 2015, which are to be located in high profile locations.\n\nIn our view, the value of an ATM network will become clearer over time, as the actual network of Bitcoin ATMs increases. If Bitcoin ATMs become a more common occurrence throughout the world, it could encourage more people to use bitcoin or other digital currencies, making the entire bitcoin network/ecosystem more valuable.\n\nTo receive a complimentary copy of the full RedChip Research Report for BTCS, please visit: http://www.redchip.com/assets/reports/BTCS_ResearchProfile_20150323.pdf\n\nAbout RedChip Companies, Inc.\n\nRedChip Companies, an Inc. 5000 company, is an international small-cap research, investor relations, and media company headquartered in Orlando, Florida; with affiliate offices in San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Seoul.

Factom is described as “a data layer for the blockchain” that will help businesses manage their data.\n\nTo gain access to that Factom network, though, requires Factoids, a digital token designed specifically for the Factom network. Starting tomorrow, these new coins will be available for sale. However, they will not be dispersed until May 15th.\n\nThis is where ShapeShift comes into play. ShapeShift allows for users to instantly convert from one cryptocurrency to the other. A user could trade their bitcoin instantly for litecoin or convert from dogecoin to Ripple. This ease of transferring from one currency to the other is the catalyst for this partnership.\n\n“Factom will be listing ShapeShift as a recommended way for Factoid Software Sale participants that do not have bitcoin to get BTC for other digital tokens,” explained David Johnston, Chairman of the Factom Foundation. The second part of this agreement will introduce Factom onto the ShapeShift platform so that users could easily convert in and out of the currency. This part of the partnership, Johnston explained, wouldn’t happen until after May 15thwhen the software sale finished.\n\n“Our team spent substantial time researching the technologies and protocols available to build scalable blockchain based applications and the conclusion we reached is that Factom had a solid approach and architecture for publishing and securing general data to the blockchain and so we decided to integrate their digital token into our platform,” said Erik Voorhees, ShapeShift CEO, in a written statement to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThis partnership means that any user that wants to exchange in and out of Factoids once they launch can utilize ShapeShift’s platform. This makes ShapeShift the first partner to integrate Factoid tokens. In addition, there are no fees associated with transferring between Factoid and any other currency beyond the typical exchange rate, which is based on the market rate of Factoids.\n\nBlockchain scalability remains a topic that many in the bitcoin community debate. Even Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, has talked extensively about the need for scalability on the blockchain. Originally, the size of one block was infinite, but due to denial-of-service attacks, Satoshi rolled the size back to one megabyte. (https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/a-scalability-roadmap/)\n\nBy taking any data, as Factom does, and processing it on a layer above the blockchain to encoding it all down into one hash, the data can still be verified on the blockchain. In addition, this approach minimizes bloat on the blockchain as only data hashes are stored. This partnership will facilitate the ability for users to acquire Factoid and begin using the network.\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect the fact that ShapeShift is only the first partner to integrate the Factoid tokens and the partnership is not exclusive.', 'I just bought £650 ($1,000) of Ocado stock because I believe this company is going to totally change online grocery shopping in the UK, and most people have no clue that this change is on its way.\n\nLet\'s back up a bit: The other night I went to Sainsbury\'s to buy a Prawn Makhani, possibly one of the most delicious objects on earth. I stood in line at the checkout for what seemed like ages and was then semi-forced by a staffer to use one of its automated self-service tills. I made the mistake of also buying a bottle of beer, which required an assistant to verify my age — buying beer is treated like a food-crime if you do it at the self-checkout. Of course the register took several goes before it properly recognised the two items I was trying to buy. (I\'ve accidentally ""stolen"" things at Sainsbury\'s before because those self-checkouts are so imprecise.)\n\nThe experience took longer than using a human at the old-fashioned checkout.\n\nIt was infuriating. There has to be a better way, I thought.\n\nAnd there is: Ocado.\n\nPunch in what you want on your phone and a day or so later a nice man or woman drops it off at your house. Ocado has transformed the 1 hour chore that was a trip to Sainsbury\'s into a 10 minute task that I barely have to think about.\n\nThat\'s why I think Ocado is going to win its long war against the supermarket business.\n\nUsually, journalists are forbidden from investing in the companies they write about because it might make them biased. It\'s a good rule. At Business Insider we have a more liberal policy, merely requiring transparency and disclosure. (You can see my permanent conflict of interest disclosure here .)\n\nMore broadly, I found that owning stock made me more sensitive to news about the companies and what was going on inside them. (I previously bought and then sold Facebook and Google, and I still hold shares of Twitter.) It made my understanding of them much more acute. I don\'t think it made my coverage of those companies more positive or fluffy. Quite the opposite — you can get pretty angry, and attentive, when a company makes a mistake that costs you money.\n\nNonetheless, I have been criticised for doing this in the past, and you can read one of those critiques here.\n\nThe rap against Ocado is that it has never shown a profit. The company surprised everyone by blowing a hole in that myth on its last earnings call — it showed a profit for 2014.\n\nThat profit, however, is irrelevant. Ocado is a revenues growth story, it\'s not an earnings per share company. It\'s basically the Amazon of food in the UK. Every year, every quarter, it piles on the revenues — and shareholders just seem to shrug with indifference.\n\nIn the future, I expect CEO Tim Steiner to pour every penny of Ocado\'s sales back into the further expansion of the company. That will likely yield more growing revenues and tiny profits. More importantly, it will further degrade the market share of its bigger high street supermarket rivals. My theory is investors will finally figure out that Ocado is a better bet on the future than Tesco is.\n\nIn other words, if you think Amazon was a good investment, then you ought to think Ocado is a good investment. That is my bet. I am holding Ocado for a long period.\n\nOcado\'s stock has seen some ups and down recently. It once hit a high of 600p but is now floating around 350p. Investors don\'t seem to know what to do with it. Here are two highlights from recent analyst reports. Note they have diametrically opposed views of where Ocado is going:\n\nBank of America (Sherri Malek et al.): "" ... Ocado’s proprietary online grocery solution will remain the most attractive for retailers globally, as the alternatives pale in comparison. Its superior economics could ultimately make its offering cheaper than traditional formats, which would revolutionise the grocery sector.""\n\nDeutsche Bank (Niamh McSherry et al.): ""Our Sell recommendation reflects the profitability we think is achievable for both Ocado\'s retail business and more importantly for its licensing business. Specifically, we expect a declining order size to off-set potential improvements in delivery costs, limiting the margin upside. ""\n\nClearly, I believe that BAML\'s Malek has got this right and Deutsche\'s McSherry will be proven wrong. Profits are irrelevant at Ocado — it\'s all about growth.\n\nHere are the reasons I think Ocado has so much growth ahead of it:\n\nOcado doesn\'t even cover the entire UK yet: Ocado currently only has two massive ""customer fulfilment centres"" open right now . It is building a third (Andover) and has plans for a fourth (Bexley). Ocado is basically a South of England phenomenon at the moment. Ocado hasn\'t really started on much of the North of England, Wales or Scotland yet. That is a lot of unrealised growth.\n\nOcado can expand internationally: The company hasn\'t started talking about the rest of Europe.\n\nIt\'s a platform, not a supermarket: Ocado\'s app is currently used for grocery shopping. The underlying tech can be used for any kind of buying experience. Any non-competing supermarket that wanted to add a delivery business could license the Ocado tech. And any company that wanted to do non-grocery shopping could licence the Ocado tech. The possibilities are endless.\n\nOcado is one of the UK\'s biggest under-sung tech companies: It employs about 550 people in tech, up from 400 the year prior. Because it delivers milk and beer, people don\'t seem to regard it as a tech company. But if its tech staff were a standalone company, people in the tech world would be raving about its size and success.\n\nOcado has a spookily effective corporate culture: I have surreptitiously grilled my Ocado delivery drivers for info on the company for the last few months. They all love it. Every experience I\'ve had with Ocado has been super-polite, and super-efficient. This seems to be a company that is dedicated to nailing it, every day, in a way that Sainsbury\'s just isn\'t.\n\nI can\'t find anyone who complains about Ocado: Every time I meet someone who also uses Ocado I ask them if they have ever dropped the service. I have yet to find a ""post-Ocado"" customer.\n\nOcado might get acquired: CFO Duncan Tatton-Brown says the company isn\'t for sale . But never say never!\n\nThere are some obvious downsides:\n\nFirstly, the market is clearly reaching some sort of peak and is due for a correction or pullback. I intend to own Ocado for a long time so I am expecting shares to go down further in the short-term.\n\nSecondly, the last couple of times I bought stock and wrote about it — Facebook and Twitter — both companies\' shares responded by taking immediate nosedives. (Both those bets paid off in the long-run, though.)\n\nSo there you have it. I have put my money where my mouth is. It will be interesting to see if Mr. Steiner justifies my faith.', 'When one looks at a map of the world, it might seem a little odd that Europe and Asia are considered to be two separate continents. The distinction is arbitrary only in the sense that even the boundaries themselves have shifted from time to time; Herodotus claimed that Europe was that part of the land mass to the west of the river Phasis, or for those of you who are not familiar with Ancient Greek nomenclature, the river Rioni, situated in modern day Georgia.\n\nLater it became the land between the Rock of Gibraltar and the River Don. It was Russian ambition that finally put to rest the confusion. The Geopolitical history of modern Russia can be summed up in one simple observation, the desire for a port that was free from ice all year round; Strahlenberg’s redefinition of Europe as being all that is west of the Urals and all that is north of the Caucasus was bankrolled by the Russian Empress Anna. And just like that, Russia went from being in Asia to being in Europe. Not that this helped Russia’s dream of an ice free port, there was a small problem to overcome, actually it was quite a large one, The Ottoman Empire.\n\nModern Turkey\n\nModern Turkey is all that remains of what was once one of the greatest empires the world has ever known. It rose to prominence in the 13th century and in one of the most famous dates in human history, 1453, Constantinople fell to Turkish forces under the command of Mehmed II. All that was left of the Roman empire, known as Byzantium by this time was swept away forever. The Ottoman Empire flourished; they led the world in terms of science and medicine, and with cultural giants such as China withdrawing from the world at around the same time, they became a center of learning, architecture, and knowledge. Of course, it all went wrong. Things always do.\n\nModern Turkey is something of a chimera; a state that has repeatedly bent over backwards in its overtures to joining the EU, it’s social policies, though based on democratic ideals, remain too draconian for serious consideration. Recent events have not helped. Last years governmental ban-fest made international news; Twitter, You Tube and even Minecraft demonstrated that the Turkish government was still locked in the immature tantrum stage of burgeoning democracy.\n\nBitcoin regulation and services in Turkey\n\nThe lack of political moderation however did not extend to bitcoin. Regulation of the currency remains undecided in Turkey, with the BRSA only stating that bitcoin does not qualify as electronic money. That being the case, bitcoin is not covered under existing legislation and is therefore, unregulated. And yet Turkey is unquestionably a hub of bitcoin activity. Bitup Card a bitcoin voucher scheme is the brain child of two separate entities, the Berlin based MKPayment Solutions and the Amsterdam bitcoin voucher scheme bit4coin. The voucher scheme boasts an impressive array of 300 merchants willing to accept the gift cards a cross the country, And that’s just for starters.\n\nTurkish Lira can be traded for bitcoin thanks to the efforts of BTC Turk, and though the capital sports only a single bitcoin ATM there are definite signs that Turkey is moving in the right direction. Unhampered by the need to pay lip service to an overarching tax regulation, as is the case in the EU, Turkey looks poised to take advantage of the choppy waters of the rest of Europe.\n\nFeatured image via G.OZCAN.\n\nIan Jackson is an Inside Bitcoins correspondent based in the U.K.']"
03/31/2015,"[""Following Ross Ulbricht's Silk Road conviction, extraordinary details have emerged about two of the investigating federal agents charged with extortion, fraud, and theft of bitcoins from the marketplace. With a shocking dossier of information now revealed, it is possible that the Feds might have had a role in the Mt Gox implosion.\n\nLead agents involved\n\nTwo federal agents who took part in the Silk Road trial have been charged with fraud for allegedly embezzling bitcoin while on assignment.\n\nSecret Service agent Shaun Bridges, and Drug Enforcement Agency agent Carl Force, had both served as federal agents for years prior to the start of the “murder-for-hire” investigation that brought them to the case of Ross Ulbricht and the Silk Road.\n\nForce was the lead agent in the case, tasked with investigating the much reported assassination services that became intertwined with the dark market's general reputation, and specifically with Dread Pirate Robert's alleged attempts to silence blackmailers.\n\nBridges was brought in as the computer forensics expert in this case, and the criminal complaint sheet now filed against the agents elaborates on how their positions brought them into the digital currency ecosystem. The sheet reads:\n\n“In this capacity, FORCE was the lead undercover agent in communication with DPR, the owner, administrator and operator of the Silk Road website. BRIDGES was the computer forensics expert on the Baltimore investigation. In their capacity as members of the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force, both FORCE and BRIDGES had significant exposure to and developed expertise in the digital currency known as Bitcoin.”\n\nAlthough this investigation was separate from the main drug trafficking operation against the site and its allegations remain pending to this day, the story of DPR's attempts to have his opponents murdered would go on to be used extensively during Ulbricht's trial.\n\nTemptation\n\nThe scene that unfolded in front of Force and Bridges however was probably unlike any they had ever encountered in their previous work on federal investigations.\n\nIt was 2012 when the case opened and the agents stepped into a world in which Ulbricht was making millions of dollars through the Silk Road marketplace. Unlike conventional drug trafficking however, he would have appeared to remain completely divorced from the criminal gangs, and drug lords that normally control this space through violence and intimidation.\n\nYears of tracking money laundering through off-shore accounts and front companies must have seemed redundant as the agents learned more about Bitcoin's decentralized and apparently anonymous technology. Seeing the early 2013 price spike to US$238/BTC must have excited the two investigators just as much as it did the rest of the Bitcoin community.\n\nThe criminal charge sheet in the case shows just how large the volume of funds involved in the Silk Road must have seemed to the pair, as it became too tempting for Force to resist.\n\n“FORCE sought to extort DPR by seeking monetary payment, offering in exchange not to provide the government with certain information if DPR paid $250,000.”\n\nEven the payments Force received for his undercover role on the Silk Road site must have appeared irresistible to a federal agent making around US$90,000.\n\n“FORCE stole and converted to his own personal use a sizeable amount of bitcoins that DPR sent to FORCE in FORCE's official undercover capacity and rather than turning those bitcoin over to the government, FORCE deposited them into his own personal accounts.”\n\nThe excitement surrounding Bitcoin at the time seems to have also swept Bridges along with it. Following the arrest of Brian Richard Farrell, the Task Force gained access to a Silk Road's administrator account. The complaint sheet reads:\n\n“On January 25, 2013, the Silk Road website suffered a sizable theft of bitcoins, bitcoins which were moved into Mt. Gox […]. On February 12, 2013, BRIDGES formed and registered a personal liability company called ‘Quantum International Investments, LLC (Quantum)’ […]. Between March 6, 2013 through May 7, 2013 BRIDGES' Quantum Fidelity account in the United States received nine wire transfers from Mt. Gox totaling approximately $820,000.”\n\nBoth agents found themselves involved in Bitcoin at a time when a large number of individuals were getting incredibly rich. Many made money through honest investments and trading, but even those involved with criminal activity appeared untainted by the normal criminal operations. Like Bridges and Force, these individuals were also sitting behind a computer screen each day, the difference being that DPR and other users weren't receiving a federal salary.\n\nBlockchain transparency, Bitstamp and TNABC Miami\n\nDespite knowing how the Silk Road investigation was proceeding however, the scale of available money seems to have blinded the agents to just how traceable, open, and trustless, the blockchain really is as it can be used to view to historic transactions, in addition to the ease, with which governments can link wallet addresses to individuals through the monitoring of web traffic.\n\nIronically, the same chat logs that have put Ulbricht behind bars are now unraveling a web of false identities Force and Bridges used to extort DPR.\n\nThe blockchain still holds every transaction the agents made as they scrambled to remove funds from the Silk Road to their personal wallets while the false companies and traditional money laundering the pair attempted still links their records to the stolen funds.\n\nForce allegedly tried to cover his tracks by using his federal badge to demand BitStamp, the exchange he has used, to delete his transaction history. The site had repeatedly blocked Force's account due to his suspicious activity and extensive use of TOR.\n\nHeightening the sense of federal links in the digital currency space, it has also emerged that the Assistant Attorney from the Department of Justice who filed the complaint again Bridges and Force is Kathryn Haun, who took part at the Miami TNABC conference held in January. Her conference bio highlights her credentials for the new role working against the corrupt agents:\n\n“She has investigated and prosecuted hundreds of violations of federal criminal law in U.S. courts, with a particular focus on transnational and organized crime syndicates, money laundering, virtual and digital currency providers.”\n\nCan-o-worms\n\nDespite many government's repeated accusations that digital currencies are hot-beds of money laundering, the truth is that even two federal investigators armed with an inner knowledge of how such investigations work, were unable to effectively use Bitcoin to move and hide funds anonymously.\n\nUlbricht's lawyer Joshua Dratel has now issued a statement voicing his outrage that none of this evidence was allowed as admissible in Ulbricht's trial, arguing that “the government deprived the jury of essential facts, and Mr. Ulbricht of due process.”\n\nMajor Silk Road govt corruption scandal revelation today that we've had to sit on for four months and were not permitted to use at trial. — Joshua Dratel (@JDratel) March 30, 2015\n\nBut for now, with Ulbricht already convicted and the trial of Bridges and Force able to get underway, many in the community are now beginning to question just how involved agents like these two are in cases such as the infamous implosion of Mt. Gox. Interestingly enough, the information that Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles was under investigation in relation to the Silk Road was a key bargaining chip used by Force when extorting DPR, and it was Bridge's signature that seized US$5 million from the exchange in August 2013.\n\nSix months later the site closed following the loss of US$620 million, and it's only now with Bridges and Force on trial that we may begin to gain a better understanding of what really happened.\n\nDid you enjoy this article? You may also be interested in reading these ones:"", 'Bitcoin is deflationary, meaning that mined coins are finite. Once miners unearth 21 million coins, that will be the total number of Bitcoins that will ever exist. But due to lost and forgotten wallets, active Bitcoins will be far lower than that.\n\nOn the 30th March 2015, Bitcoin reached the total circulation amount of 14 million coins. There is now two thirds of the total amount of Bitcoins mined that there ever will be in existence. From this we may predict that there will be a rising price in bitcoin due to scarcity, over the long term, as the bounty for miners will be halved to 12.5 BTC per block next year.\n\nAccording to The Genesis Block 10% of Bitcoins haven’t been active since 2012, and a substantial 35% haven’t been spent since 2011. This second number is most likely to consist of lost coins.\n\nBitcoins can be lost due to irrecoverable passwords, forgotten wallets from when Bitcoin was worth little, from hardware failure or because of the death of the bitcoin owner. It’s extremely improbable and effectively impossible to recover lost coins. At press times the total value of lost bitcoins is roughly $1.23 billion USD.\n\nAn interesting fact is that the person or group who created Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, has over one million coins that were mined during the early stages of the renowned crypto-currency. These bitcoins have remained unspent and moved, whether or not this was intentional or not, the motivation remains unknown.\n\nThis pile of bitcoins accounts for one third of all inactive coins in existence. Not a single satoshi has been moved or spent. Is there some cunning plan for these coins in the future? We will never know, but can assume after years and years of inactivity they are lost.\n\nAnother possibility for bitcoins to be lost is by “burning” them. This can be done by setting up a wallet with no known private key. The wallet can still be seen online, complete with every transaction, but the funds will likely never be retrieved. An example of a wallet like this that was created for no logical reason at all is Bitcoin Eater.\n\nFor individuals it’s obviously bad news to lose Bitcoins, but for the rest of the Bitcoin economy it barely causes a ripple. In fact, due to a tiny drop in supply, other people’s holdings would theoretically see a small increase in value if a person lost his or her Bitcoins.\n\nAs Bitcoins are far more valuable now than in the early days, losses should reduce in the future with the decline of careless treatment. The first 50 BTC ever mined can be found at this address, which would have been worth less than a penny at the time, but now is worth over $12,500 USD.\n\nThe amount of lost coins will only ever increase.\n\nWhat do you think has happened to the millions of lost bitcoins? Share your thoughts below.', 'Many grand claims have been made for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. It is easy for critics to see them and scoff, but if digital currencies and peer-to-peer payment systems really do take off, even our wildest dreams could underestimate the ultimate potential outcomes. If you are old enough, think back to the early days of mobile phones, when video calls, directions to a destination and online shopping were all regarded as geek fantasies. There were even a few crazy voices proclaiming that phone photography could spell the end for some companies, possibly even giants like Eastman Kodak! That seemed ridiculous at the time and there were no shortage of people pointing that out, right up until Kodak declared bankruptcy in 2012.\n\nSimilarly, when proponents of Bitcoin have said that widespread adoption could herald the end of the banking business as we know it, some have laughed. How could some plaything of the computer nerds impact the biggest, most powerful industry of the modern era? One group not laughing, however, are the banks themselves. The high and mighty of Wall Street and the City have quietly embraced digital currencies, either by way of investing in the space or trading the currency itself. Now, the British Banking Association has said in a very direct way, that Bitcoin is a ""...threat to the banking industry.""\n\nCynics from each side of the debate will no doubt draw different conclusions from that statement. It will be seen by Bitcoin’s early adopters as the kind of entitled whining that they expect from the banking industry; a thinly disguised plea for governments to strangle digital currencies by regulation. Opponents will see it as a dire warning; I mean, how could the world survive without banks? Sure, they suck some money out of the economy, but they make the world of commerce go round, right? Whatever one’s view of the statement, however, there is one fascinating question: Could it be true?\n\nIn theory, of course, it could. If everybody in the world started to use Bitcoin exclusively, nobody would deposit in banks and they would collapse, but nobody truly envisages that scenario. What has the industry worried is not so much Bitcoin as the blockchain. Banks are so used to taking a cut every time money changes hands that they cannot imagine life without that particular revenue stream. In 2013 the banks handled a staggering $410 trillion in non-cash transactions according to the Boston Consulting Group, and that number is expected to grow to $780 trillion by 2023. That’s an awfully big market that they are taking a slice of and the blockchain, as an ultra low fee competitor, has them worried.\n\nEven widespread adoption of a digital peer-to-peer currency would hardly be a death blow. Transaction revenues, which are what the blockchain could eat into, totaled $425 billion in 2014. That sounds like a lot of money for simply facilitating the transfer of money. However, when you consider that Bank of America (BAC) alone saw revenues of $95.18 billion that year, you come to understand that skimming from our transactions represents only a tiny part of the revenue of banks worldwide.\n\nWhile the widespread adoption of Bitcoin or any other altcoin will not lead directly to the demise of banking, though, it could lead to banks taking actions that make that a possibility. The thing about that $425 billion is that it is some of the only money that banks make that has zero associated risk and very little associated cost. There is no risk, and hardly any cost, in charging you $30 to receive a wire transfer, especially when the bank takes three days of interest on that money by delaying payment to you. If that revenue is removed or even seriously reduced, it will have to be replaced, meaning that a higher proportion of bank revenue will be coming from increasingly risky loans or trading. To see where that can lead we need look no further than 2008/9.\n\nWhen the British Banking Association says that Bitcoin is a threat to banking, it would seem that they are, at least to some extent, just bleating. It may well be a threat to the easy money that banks currently take from you and me, but that doesn’t pose an existential threat to the system. The banks’ reaction to a reduction in that easy money, on the other hand, could be a different story.', 'US retail giant Overstock has invested in blockchain technology specialist Peernova as part of its second tranche of Series A financing.\n\nFormed through a merger between cloud mining contract provider CloudHashing and ASIC hardware designer HighBitcoin in early 2014, Peernova raised $8.6m in funding last December as it sought to accelerate its shift away from mining.\n\nIn statements, general manager of Overstock\'s Cryptocurrencies Group Judd Bagley framed Overstock\'s first investment in a bitcoin industry firm as a vote of confidence in the decentralized ledger-based technologies Peernova is currently building.\n\nBagley told CoinDesk:\n\n""PeerNova is precisely the kind of company we’re eager to back up.

Is the resulting model tractable — can we analyze it mathematically or using simulations? And most importantly, do its predictions match what we observe in practice?\n\nLet’s look at those questions in the context of a “block withholding attack” between mining pools.\n\nRecall that mining pools are groups of individual miners who pool their computing power as well as their rewards. Suppose two mining pools — let’s call them blue and red — are both seeking to maximize their mining rewards. Let’s say the manager of the red pool decides to infiltrate the blue pool and decrease their efficiency using some of the mining power that red (directly or indirectly) controls. This can be done by submitting shares (partial proofs of work) to earn a share of rewards, but withholding any valid blocks which are found and therefore not contributing any productive work to the blue pool. At first sight this seems like cutting off your nose to spite your face — sure, blue’s efficiency will be hurt, but red is wasting hash power as well.\n\nTo get a handle on this situation, let’s write down three rules that govern rewards in pooled mining:\n\nA pool’s revenues in any period are proportional to the number of Bitcoin blocks that its members mine, measured as a fraction of the total blocks mined in that period. A miner’s rewards are proportional to the number of “shares” submitted, as a fraction of the total shares submitted by all members of that pool. Miners can easily create numerous pseudo-identities (“sybils”), each contributing a very small amount of mining power. Therefore pools can’t easily detect if a miner is withholding valid blocks (and can’t punish a miner for doing so).\n\nThese rules are somewhat of an approximation, but they are widely accepted as a starting point due to their analytical clarity. Within this framework, we’d like to determine if a block withholding attack can be profitable. This is obviously an important question, and it’s also well-defined mathematically. We’ve taken all elements of human behavior out of the equation, so we can do some arithmetic to check the answer.\n\nLet’s say that initially, blue and red both manage 50% of mining power. For this example, let’s ignore 51% attacks.\n\nNow red devotes half its power (25% of the total) to infiltrating blue’s pool, and sends only shares and not blocks to the pool. This means that of all the blocks reaching the Bitcoin network, 2/3 are coming from blue and 1/3 from red. Mining rewards will therefore be distributed between the two pools in the same ratio, 2/3 and 1/3.\n\nBut of blue’s rewards, blue will pay a third out to red and only keep two-thirds for itself. That’s because red contributes 1/3 of blue’s shares and pools pay out on the basis of shares, not blocks. Recall that blue can’t tell which miners the misbehavior is coming from. In other words, blue keeps four-ninths of global mining rewards, and pays two-ninths out to red. Combined with the one-third that red earns directly, red’s share is five-ninths.\n\nThis means that block withholding attacks can in theory be profitable, which is an extremely interesting fact on its own.\n\nWhat is mind-boggling, though, is that while people had asked the question for a long time of whether block withholding could be profitable, somehow no one had done the arithmetic presented in the last few paragraphs to discover the answer. The profitability of this attack was first pointed out in a paper by Courtois and Bahack last year that didn’t get much attention. Recently Ittay Eyal analyzed it rigorously, doing some neat game theoretic analysis of a situation with multiple attacking pools, and also brought it to wider attention.\n\nThis is not the only example of an obvious-in-retrospect break of widely held assumptions about the stability of Bitcoin mining. There’s at least Eyal and Sirer’s selfish mining and Andrew Miller’s feather fork. In each case, miners can potentially gain by deviating from the default protocol. Even though the models of mining used in these analyses are very simple, it took years to spot these bugs. And we can be sure we haven’t found the last of them.\n\nI’m using the word bugs for a reason. If you think about the tremendous progress that’s been made in software testing and model checking for finding software bugs and writing correct programs, it’s hard to believe we haven’t found a way to represent Bitcoin’s strategy space in a formal language and automatically probe for deviant strategies. Is it simply a matter of the game theory and Bitcoin research communities having no overlap? Or are the tools developed in game theory for automated analysis of equilibria not capable of handling the domain of Bitcoin mining for some reason? [1]\n\nBitcoin offers an excellent testbed to explore and improve our knowledge of game theory. Due to the large financial incentives at stake, theoretical knowledge about strategies is considered very valuable. And yet, unlike, say, the stock market, the system is “closed” and relatively amenable to modeling and analysis. [2] We’re only slowly starting to exploit this opportunity, and further work in this area can enrich both Bitcoin and game theory.\n\nFinally, there’s been little or no evidence of miners employing deviant strategies in practice so far. While this doesn’t in any way diminish the importance of the type of analysis we’ve talked about, it’s important to ask what’s causing the gap between models and observed behavior. I’ll take up this question in the next post.\n\n[1] There’s been some work in the Bitcoin community on building mining simulators. This is a different approach, but also an interesting direction.\n\n[2] For the system to be closed we have to ignore factors like the impact of mining strategies on the Bitcoin exchange rate. This will be the focus of the next post.', 'BELIZE CITY, Belize--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Advanced Cash, an easy to use and versatile online payment system, announced they started working with BitPay, the world’s leading Bitcoin payment processor, to continue their bitcoin functionality.

The company has raised over $32 million from top investors including Index Ventures, Founders Fund, and Sir Richard Branson.', 'This is a guest post from Digital Currency Council Member Marty Zigman.\n\nRecently, I gave a webcast presentation to AICPA members to help accounting professionals understand Bitcoin and how to treat it on the general ledger. If you are an AICPA member, the webcast is available for your viewing. In this article, the key points from that presentation are outlined and will help accountants fundamentally understand and approach business based Bitcoin transactions.\n\nBitcoin and General Ledger Treatment\n\nThere are three key processes that ultimately produce different accounting practices and general ledger treatment when Bitcoin is involved. These three processes coincide with Bitcoin’s adoption phases as follows:\n\nPayment Method Foreign Currency Base Currency\n\nBitcoin as a type of “Payment Method”\n\nWithin the context of modern accounting systems, examples of payment methods include cash, checks and credit cards. Very simply, they define the medium used to exchange money.\n\nToday, the most common business use for Bitcoin is to treat it as a payment method. Much of the reason for this is because a) the price is relatively volatile and b) acceptance by employees, suppliers and partners is relatively limited. Services such as BitPay or Coinbase have effectively made it easy to accept bitcoin in a business. Instead of the business actually receiving bitcoin during customer payment, these services deliver traditional government-issued (fiat) currency.\n\nUnder this method, Bitcoin acceptance is easy to understand and it follows accounting practices widely used in business today (e.g., consider payment by services such as PayPal). Traditional accounting systems should have no problem under this practice. Generally, define a new payment method in the accounting software, relate it to the bank account that the funds will settle, and then follow the procedures that the Bitcoin service provider prescribes for accepting bitcoin in the business.\n\nBitcoin as a type of “Foreign Currency”\n\nThe next adoption wave will happen if bitcoin price volatility stabilizes and it becomes more widely accepted. Some leading-edge businesses already work in this fashion. Under this method of accounting, bitcoin is treated as a foreign currency; just as one would treat accepting Euros in a USD-based organization. To do this well, the business accounting system will need to understand foreign currency and related exchange prices. Traditional accounting platforms are designed with “currency data types” to accommodate only two decimal places. I was one of the early advocates to logically shift the bitcoin decimal place to the right by six digits and base bitcoin in micro bitcoin (µBitcoin) thus allowing it to work in common general ledger accounting systems.\n\nNot all accounting systems allow for new foreign currency definitions — hence, if the business software is designed only for local currency, this method of accounting will not work. In addition, some accounting systems “hard code” their foreign currency references, and accountants may find this to be a limitation in their client or internal systems.\n\nUnder foreign currency accounting, a business bases its transactions in a local currency but may denominate transactions and/or accept foreign currency to conduct business. This practice is well understood in larger organizations — especially ones that transact in international trade.\n\nUnder this method of accounting, without respect for local tax regulations that demand different regulatory reporting requirements, bitcoin transactions effectively trigger both realized and unrealized gains and losses based on changing market currency exchange rates and timing differences between when transaction obligations are recognized and ultimately settled.\n\nFinally, when bitcoin is treated as a foreign currency, the accounting software will price every single transaction relative to the base currency. With this price information in hand, a tax accountant can reconstitute the records offline to meet regulatory reporting requirements; such as the recent IRS guidelines that demands that bitcoin be treated as a property.\n\nBitcoin as a type of “Base Currency”\n\nIn the final adoption wave, while it may be far off, it is conceivable to see businesses deem bitcoin as the base currency and thus treat all other currencies as foreign — even the home currency. While this is simply an enhancement of the Foreign Currency treatment previously discussed, this method may be valuable for organizations that are fundamentally global and trade with customers, employees, suppliers and partners anywhere and everywhere. While, this accounting treatment will produce a different orientation and obviously introduces interesting reporting questions, if many organizations elect this method, it does represent a way to measure whether bitcoin has indeed achieved wide global acceptance.\n\nIs Bitcoin integrated with the General Ledger today?\n\nCompanies that run NetSuite are set up to transact globally and with BTC4ERP, they have the full range of options to configure their accounting practices based on the way they see bitcoin used in their business. I witness some companies who simply seek a bitcoin price feed into their accounting system to help them with their own manual methods of accounting. Others indeed treat Bitcoin transactions as foreign currency and rely on the automatic bookkeeping and transaction coordination provided by my service. If bitcoin gains wider acceptance, I suspect we will see these accounting treatments on a wider range of accounting systems.', 'Silk Road was a site on the dark web that allowed people to make numerous transactions ranging from the unusual to the shady to the downright illegal.\n\nThese purchases and sales were largely made with Bitcoins and other digital currencies to help prevent them from being traced by law enforcement.\n\nUltimately, the site was shut down thanks in part to the efforts of undercover federal agents who investigated the site.\n\nBut it turns out that those agents weren’t just looking into what was going on at Silk Road, but actively profiting from their time there as well.\n\nTwo agents, including Carl Mark Force IV of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Shaun Bridges of the Secret Service were charged with money laundering and wire fraud on Monday in connection with their actions during those investigations.\n\nThe agents had already resigned after growing pressure and inquiry into how they conducted themselves during the investigation.\n\nAgents Moved Bitcoins Into Personal Accounts\n\nForce was also charged with theft of government property and conflict of interest. The criminal complaint against the two men, which was unsealed Monday in federal court, explained that Force “stole and converted to his own personal use a sizable amount of Bitcoins” that he had obtained while doing his undercover work.\n\n“Rather than turning those Bitcoin over to the government, Force deposited them into his own personal accounts,” the complaint alleges.\n\nBridges is charged with similar actions. According to the complaint, he is a computer forensics expert, and moved over $800,000 in Bitcoins and other digital currencies into a personal account after obtaining it during the investigation.\n\nUlbricht Case Didn’t Include Information About Agents’ Misdeeds\n\nThese accusations have been a sticking point in the trial of Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road website. While Force and Bridges were part of a Baltimore investigation into the site, Ulbricht was convicted after a separate Manhattan-based investigation led to charges that went to trial.\n\nAccording to lawyer Joshua Dratel, who represents Ulbricht, the government made aggressive efforts to remove “any reference to Agent Force’s activities” during the trial, including having a request to do so granted by the presiding judge. In addition, Dratel says that “only a portion of what is revealed in [the complaint against Force and Bridges]” was disclosed before Ulbricht’s trial.\n\n“It is clear from this complaint that fundamentally, the government’s investigation of Mr. Ulbricht lacked any integrity and was wholly and fatally compromised from the inside,” Dratel said.\n\nIt’s unclear whether there really is any chance that the charges against Force or Bridges could help Ulbricht’s case. According to the attorney’s office in Manhattan, their investigation was completely independent of the one in Baltimore, and that no evidence from the Baltimore inquiry was used in their case.\n\nThey also say that the charges against Force and Bridges are only about corruption on the parts of the agents, not about anything that could impact Ulbricht’s guilt or innocence.\n\nBoth agents committed crimes that involved abusing their positions while interacting with Bitcoin. For instance, Force is alleged to have sent an unauthorized subpoena from the Justice Department to an online payment processor compelling the company to unfreeze his account.\n\nBridges was said to have put money into the now-defunct Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange days before warrants were filed against the site, while Force invested over $100,000 in Bitcoin into CoinMKT, another Bitcoin exchange.', 'ZapGo aims to revolutionize how young South Africans spend their cash online. The new mobile money start-up by South Africans Michail Brynard and Helghardt Avenant (currently halfway through the Boost VC accelerator program in Silicon Valley), uses the Bitcoin network as the underlying mechanism to transfer value.\n\nHowever, this is not an entirely new business. The duo ran it as Xoin prior and offered a slightly different service of selling bitcoin redeemable vouchers as an easy way to make the crypto coin accessible to many.\n\nFrom Xoin, they learned that bitcoin in its raw form is too complicated for mainstream users. And they pivoted to ZapGo, where all the tricky stuff about cryptocurrency is hidden from the user experience.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe beta version of the new Android app launched in early March 2015, and the first place it has taken off is Stellenbosch University, near Cape Town, South Africa. Here students use it to buy such things as Wi-Fi credit, study notes, and birthday gifts. Other things they can buy include airtime from Bitrefill and games from Humble Bundle. According to Avenant, ZapGo works anywhere bitcoin is accepted.\n\nZapGo plans to expand eventually to other university campuses around the country to reach early adopters. They are targeting young South Africans who have never bought anything online but are interested in spending spare change online.\n\nAvenant:\n\n""We grew up as teenagers in South Africa in a time where it was almost impossible to buy online. Today, ten years later nothing has changed. There are millions of teenagers with smartphones and no easy way for them to spend their spare change on the internet. ZapGo is changing this.”\n\nIn order to use ZapGo, users have to a visit a local agent, hand over their cash and mobile number or email address, and then the agent will load their account just like airtime. The balance always appears in local currency. And agents are allowed to charge a commission of between 0 and 20 %.\n\nEasy online shopping\n\nThere is also the option of topping up using bitcoin wallets. This option is the most appropriate for those out of South Africa. Agents use either Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or bitcoins to top up their accounts. They have to submit verification documents for KYC and AML compliance for the former.\n\nThe app could not have come at a better time. The number of Africans getting online is growing, and, therefore, the need to shop online is catching up on the continent. While this happens, acquiring and using credit cards has not become easier. It is fair to say that with ZapGo, Michail Brynard and Helghardt Avenant are helping Africa lead cryptocurrency into a future where ordinary users do not need to know what it is and how it works to benefit from the technology.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

In theory, airlines will also be able to accept virtual currency payments via mobile applications, in-flight entertainment systems and at kiosks.\n\n“As ancillary products and services continue to be a vital business component at every touch point where travel operators connect with their passengers, and with an ever growing population of travellers carrying smartphones and holding virtual currencies, there is a need to ensure those travellers can use Bitcoin currency consistency as a form of payment within each access point,” said Brett Proud, President & CEO of GuestLogix.\n\nConsidering Bitcoin had an estimated 1.3 million users in 2014, it seems GuestLogix is preparing for a potential jump in uptake among consumers, rather than responding to high demand for in-flight virtual currency acceptance. According to a report by Juniper Research, the number of Bitcoin users is expected to reach 4.7 million worldwide by 2019.\n\nLast year, Latvian flag carrier airBaltic became the first airline to accept online payment by Bitcoin.']"
