12/01/2015,"['The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against a Vermont man and two companies he controlled, alleging that the purported Bitcoin mining operation touted to investors was a giant Ponzi scheme that took in at least $20 million from over 10,000 victims. In a complaint filed today in a Connecticut federal court, the Commission charged Homero Joshua Garza, GAW Miners, LLC, and ZenMiner, LLC with multiple violations of federal securities laws. The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, imposition of civil monetary penalties, and prejudgment interest. The enforcement action is the second filed by the SEC involving allegations of a Bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme.\n\nAccording to the Commission, Garza, who is 30 years old, owned and controlled GAW Miners and ZenMiner. GAW Miners initially set out to purchase Bitcoin mining equipment from overseas manufacturers and resell it to customers. ""Bitcoin mining"" refers to the process through which high-powered computers are used to compete to solve complex algorithms that reward the victor with newly-minted Bitcoins. Bitcoin miners, as they are known, have increasingly employed massive amounts of pooled computing power in an attempt to profit by being the quickest to solve the equations.\n\nAfter switching the business of GAW Miners again in Spring 2014, Garza created ZenMiner and touted a new partnership between GAW Miners and ZenMiner known as Cloud Hosted Mining (""CHM""). The strategy of CHM was similar to GAW Miners\' previous operation, in that it entailed the payment of a fee to CHM to host and maintain a customer\'s mining equipment, but only allowed those customers to direct the processing power of their hardware to a handful of mining pools offered by ZenCloud. Garza allegedly deliberately distanced himself from association with ZenMiner to create the appearance of an independent company, even going so far as to convince a relative of a GAW Miners investor to pretend that he was responsible for ZenMiner. A press release was later issued indicating that GAW Miners\' parent company had purchased a controlling stake in ZenMiner for $8 million; the Commission also alleged that this press release was false.\n\nAfter customers became disgruntled with CHM\'s business model and sought the return of their mining hardware, GAW Miners and ZenMiner offered those customers the ability to convert their machines into ""Hashlets"" beginning in August 2014. A Hashlet was touted as always profitable and never obsolete, and represented a share of profits that GAW Miners and ZenMiner would purportedly generate by using their combined computing power to mine Bitcoins and altcoins - a different virtual currency that required the solving of a different equation than Bitcoin. Investors were required to pay between $10 and $50 for each Hashlet unit, with the price per unit dependent on the features and which pools the Hashlet could be used to mine. Investors were told that they simply needed to log on to a computer portal and direct which mining pools their ""Hashlets"" were to be deployed into, with some pools designated to generate a higher return than others. Investors could see the purported returns generated by these efforts in daily updates to their accounts. In total, over 10,000 investors purchased more than $19 million in Hashlets.\n\nThe Commission alleged that GAW Miners and ZenMiner significantly oversold the amount of available Hashlets for which they had the corresponding amount of computing power in the first week alone. By October 2014, the amount of altcoin-mining Hashlets was at least 100 times higher than the amount of corresponding computing power. As a result, the Commission claims that the revenues generated by mining Bitcoin were ""minimal,"" while revenues from mining altcoin ""virtually nonexistent.""\n\nBy November 2014, the daily payouts paid to Hashlet owners were outstripped by their daily ""maintenance"" fees, and by January 2015 the Hashlet mining operation was shuttered by GAW Miners and ZenMiner.\n\nDuring the Commission\'s ensuing investigation, Garza\'s brother refused to testify during a scheduled deposition and was subsequently the subject of an action filed by the Commission seeking to compel his testimony and produce requested documents.', 'Are you ready to put your new iPhone 6S to good use?

[PDF]\n\nThe paper notes that Barbados maintains a peg against the US dollar, making it necessary for the Central Bank of Barbados to hold enough reserves of several foreign currencies as a precautionary measure.\n\nThe authors note their paper provides “an assessment of the potential benefits and costs of holding bitcoins as part of the portfolio of international reserves using the case of Barbados.”\n\nThe Working Paper’s Methods\n\nThe paper was created from the usage of two main empirical tools used to conduct the analysis. One is a counterfactual exercise that used the historical performances of various exchange rates – including Bitcoin. The other is based from Monte Carlo forecasts of international currency reserves over the next decade.\n\nThe first method deduced an assessment of differences in price volatility and returns from investment in Bitcoin using a small portfolio composition of Bitcoin (as low as 0.01 percent). Other investment ratios at 0.1 percent, 1 percent and up to 5 percent of the country’s reserves were also considered.\n\nBitcoin Could Become a Key Currency\n\nOne of the primary conclusions of the paper claims:\n\nWithin recent years, the proportion of digital transactions done using digital currencies has grown significantly. As a result, it is possible that digital currency could become a key currency for settling transactions.\n\nThe paper also makes light of “issues that have to be surpassed,” including that of a country’s central bank to “legitimately look at including Bitcoin in its reserve mix.”\n\nThe paper contends that, unless recognized commercial banks, financial and central banking entities participate in the market for cryptocurrencies, regulatory authorities will continue to embrace caution. Despite the hurdles, the paper made a note of private banking institutions making inroads into such endeavors.\n\nCiting an earlier CCN article that made revealed Citibank looking to develop its own cryptocurrency, the author stated:\n\nHowever, Citibank’s intention to create its own cryptocurrency for primarily transactional service does present a model for financial entities, if not central banks, to follow.\n\nFundamentally, the paper notes that investment in Bitcoin stands a good chance of increased returns in its assessments.\n\nBarbados’ Central Bank as a Miner\n\nThe paper speculates the strategy of the Central Bank of Barbados to mine Bitcoin, while quickly noting the costs to outweigh the immediate benefits.\n\nThe Central Bank would need to “procure an already expensive expertise and considerable investment” to competitively enter the mining space, the authors note. Due to this, they conclude it would be far more prudent of the Central Bank “to be an active trader” of Bitcoin while focusing on the tools required to transfer cryptocurrencies over the blockchain.\n\nGaining this expertise would help supplement or even replace the current SWIFT or RTGS systems in use to transmit currencies, the paper notes.\n\nThe paper concludes by adding that any bitcoin reserves held should be in proportion to the use of the cryptocurrency by Barbadians.\n\nWith this in mind, the paper states:\n\n“Given that the proportion of transactions done by Barbadians in digital currency is not likely to exceed 10% of all transactions in the short run, it is recommended that if bitcoin is incorporated into the portfolio of foreign balances of the central bank of Barbados, that its share should be relatively small,” it summed up.\n\nAltogether, It is only prudent that central banks consider looking at Bitcoin as a currency reserve. A recent study suggests that Bitcoin is projected to be the sixth largest global reserve currency by 2030.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and CBB/Youtube.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Bank of England has launched a competition for Bitcoin enthusiasts to make a positive difference in society. The competition’s mission is to maintain monetary and financial stability in the United Kingdom.\n\nThis competition is open to students from all countries, and winners will have the chance to get the prize of a paid internship or a place at a graduate assessment centre.\n\nFounded in 1694, the Bank of England is the central bank of the United Kingdom. Sometimes known as the ‘Old Lady’ of Threadneedle Street, the Bank’s mission is to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the official statement from the Bank of England:\n\n“There’s a lot of buzz around blockchain. It’s a technology that allows people who don’t know each other to trust a shared record of events. And its potential won’t just impact financial services. Many believe that blockchain could track and verify almost any digital record.”\n\nTo participate, students must submit their applications by December 7th.\n\nThe Bank of England is exploring the potential of the Blockchain\n\nWe talked with experts from the UK to find out why the Bank of England has launched this competition:\n\nSimon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com and Fund Manager of Bitcoin Capital commented:\n\n""It is great that the Bank of England is exploring the potential of the Blockchain within the UK banking system, but the reality is that Bitcoin is the most interesting Blockchain there is as it has the ability to clear funds without a central bank and is opening up financial innovation on a global scale. Taking a decentralised technology / currency like Bitcoin and centralising it by calling it a Blockchain is interesting to watch but subject to similar problems as we see in the existing central banking model.”\n\nSimon Dixon adds that the money supply can be rigged, the transactions are verified by financial institutions that rely on honesty and trust that has proven to fail time and time again. “The only one of those that is working at scale is Bitcoin and Bitcoin needs no support from the Bank of England.""\n\nJamie Burke, CEO & founder of OutlierVentures.io said:\n\n""Clearly the BOE recognise the kind of people they want to attract into their organisation; innovative and with a social conscience will be thinking about blockchains already. So, whilst it would be great to think anything entered into the competition could go on and be actualised it is clearly a way to attract the right profile. It’s been said many times but the blockchain space has some of the brightest minds on the planet working on it at the moment so it’s the best recruiting pool for innovative and enquiring minds.”\n\nThis is not the first contest for students. MIT also attracted everyone who wants to received a prize of the amount of $15k.\n\nRecall, that Britain has allocated money to the study of Blockchain and considering becoming a center of the world in the cryptocurrency space.', ""Starting today, the Estonian government, in partnership with the world’s first Blockchain powered virtual country, Bitnation, will start offering a public notary service to their e-residents, using the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBrave New Coin spoke with Bitnation founder Suzanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, who shared details about this landmark project as she was getting ready to facilitate several inaugural events that will take place today.\n\n- Suzanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, Bitnation CEO\n\nTarkowski Tempelhof explained that the partnership emerged when “one of the Bitnation Ambassadors who’ve been engaged in both efforts insisted that we talked.” Soon both parties realized they had a lot of common ground in their shared belief of “providing non-geographically contingent governance services on an open and competitive market.” Tarkowski Tempelhof explained that the Estonian government “understands the dynamics of the globalization era far better than any other government.”\n\nThe Republic of Estonia, nicknamed e-Estonia, is already a testing ground for companies such as the exchange and clearinghouse operator Nasdaq, which announced last month that it had plans to develop several blockchain applications, including a solution for proxy voting.\n\nThe tiny European country appears to be a sound choice, as it’s well known for adopting technology. It was the first to offer public Wifi to its’ citizens, back in 2001, and is the birthplace of Skype. The country already offers a variety of e-programs, having added e-Residency in late in 2014.\n\n- e-Residency, e-Estonia\n\nOne of Bitnation’s primary goals is to provide the same services as traditional governments, from dispute resolution and insurance to security and much more. The difference is that Bitnation's services are geographically unbound, decentralized, and completely voluntary. There are no taxes to be a Bitnation citizen, only fees for the services you choose to use, which you can select a-la-carte.\n\nThe project was started in July 2014, and just last month Tarkowski Tempelhof and her team responded to Europe’s dire refugee crisis with a separate program, the Bitnation Refugee Emergency Response (BRER). This interesting initiative attempts to help refugees with direct assistance, by issuing blockchain-proven identity cards and VISA debit cards with pre-loaded bitcoins.\n\nThe cards are a perfect fit for refugees. While they can effortlessly accept donations from anyone in the world, through their Bitcoin public address, they can also spend the funds effortlessly on the VISA network.\n\nTarkowski Tempelhof provided an updated status of Bitnation’s refugee assistance efforts, stating that the first batch of 100 VISA cards was sent out, with the expectation that another 1000 will be sent by the end of the year. “A couple of hundred people have created emergency IDs, and we’re talking with UN agencies to get the IDs endorsed so they carry more weight when moving around in Europe,” she added.\n\n- Tarkowski Tempelhof\n\nWith the help of Bitnation, Estonia’s e-residents will now be able to notarize their marriages, birth certificates, business contracts, and much more, from anywhere in the world.\n\nTarkowski Tempelhof states emphatically that the team wants to improve the Notary service as quickly as possible, and are working hard to add more features, contract templates, and tailored applications for different types of contracts. “Once we’ve done that, we can start looking into other applications,” she added. “One that comes to mind immediately is p2p insurance.”\n\nThe service is free “for the moment,” Tarkowski Tempelhof explained, thanks to generous donations from their partners at Horizon and MaWo, and will cost e-residents as little as US$2 in the future.\n\nThe release of the public notary program coincides with the one year anniversary of the Estonian e-Residency Program. For this historic celebration, for both Estonia and Bitnation, there will be a Google Hangout at 3pm GMT that premieres a demo of the notary, and explains how it works with the e-Residency ID.\n\nAs if that was not enough cutting-edge blockchain tech on display, a couple will get married during the hangout as well, forever imprinting proof of their wedding on the blockchain as part of the ceremony. Everyone is welcome to attend.\n\n- Tarkowski Tempelhof\n\nThe couple getting married in front of witnesses, and under the auspices of Bitnation and e-Estonia, go by the names Edwrne and Mayel. They are self-proclaimed glomads and were both born in the Basque Country, an unofficial country with moving borders that extends over several different European countries’ geographical area. The couple has moved from place to place ‘their entire lives,’ which makes decentralized governance services a good fit for them.\n\n- Edwrne and Mayel\n\nHowever, couples getting married using just a public notary are not recognized in the jurisdiction of Estonia, nor in any other nation states’ jurisdiction. Instead, they get married in the blockchains jurisdiction. Blockchain technology provides a worldwide proof of existence, and integrity for contractual agreements, including marriages, all without tying them to any country or location.\n\nSimilarly, Estonia's e-Residency also has limitations. It does not give citizenship, tax residency, nor the right of entry to Estonia or to the European Union. The e-resident digi-ID is not a physical identification nor a travel document, and it does not display a photo.\n\nThe Estonian government recognizes the limitations of its e-Residency program, and is trying to improve upon it. “Currently e-residents applying for an Estonian bank account have to come to Estonia and have a ‘face-to-face’ meeting with a bank official,” states the programs documentation. “However, hopefully within the next year e-residents will be able to apply for a bank account the same way they take advantage of other Estonian services: digitally.”\n\nNevertheless, the eIDs and services on offer are built on state of the art technological solutions, such as 2048-bit public key encryption, and the e-Residency program already has over 6,700 applications from 120 countries, with more than 500 companies connected to e-residents, all while still in beta phase.\n\n- e-Estonia\n\nJust as Estonia's e-Residency places no limitation of where a resident lives, Bitnation places no restrictions on where in the world you are from, where you live, nor what passport you hold. Their motto is that everyone has the right to enjoy high-end, competitive, governance services.\n\n- Kaspar Korjus, e-Residency Program Director\n\nEstonia also understands that a digital identity itself does not inherently bring with it new risks, such as money laundering. Instead, the country recognizes that digital footprints are more easily traced, which makes existing risks more visible and manageable. According to Bitnation, this same concept is true with the blockchain. “The distributed and immutable nature of this public notary makes it more secure than any notary currently offered by traditional nation states.”\n\nCombining Estonia’s e-Residency program with Bitnation’s notary and VISA card services is a groundbreaking combination that is simply unprecedented in the history of refugee assistance. Now anyone, anywhere, that wants these important services, no matter if they are impoverished refugees or the Prime Minister of Japan, can get them online, and for a while at least, completely free."", 'Goldman Sachs filed a patent application last month for a securities settlement system based on a new cryptocurrency called ""SETLcoin"".\n\nIn a US Patent & Trademark Office application, dated 19th November, Goldman Sachs outlines a ""Cryptographic Currency For Securities Settlement"" that allows peer-to-peer participants to exchange cryptographic tokens representing securities with instant settlement.\n\nThe application states:\n\n""Traders using the described technology exchange securities by presenting an open transaction on the associated funds in their respective wallets. SETLcoin ownership is immediately transferred to a new owner after authentication and verification, which are based on network ledgers within a peer-to-peer network, guaranteeing nearly instantaneous execution and settlement.""\n\nThe exchange of SETLcoin takes place within a wallet software implementation, according to the application, and utilizes a system of marking SETLcoins to represent particular securities, using shares in IBM and Google shares as examples:\n\n""An SETLcoin wallet or transaction can house a single security, as described above, or multiple denominations of the same security (eg, 1 IBM-S SETLcoin valued at 100 IBM shares).

The coupons are dispensed by its FamiPort terminals, which are a common payment channel used for everything from paying parking ticket fines or utility bills to buying train or movie tickets.\n\nThe move is aimed at visitors to Taiwan and a growing domestic user base, FamilyMart\'s public relations manager Chen Chia-Chi told the Taiwanese news agency United Daily News.\n\nGrowing user base\n\nAccording to BitoEX, more than 500 transactions have already been made at FamilyMart stores since the feature was launched on 24th October. The firm also claims that it now has 40,000 web wallet users and a 30% annual growth rate.\n\n""There are more and more users of our bitcoin wallet now, but the market in Taiwan is still small, and it\'s still growing,"" said Rica Chiang, deputy general manager at BitoEX.\n\nThis isn\'t the startup\'s first deal with FamilyMart. Last October it launched a bitcoin-buying service with the convenience store chain, allowing customers to purchase the digital currency over the counter.\n\nThe startup says the success of the bitcoin buying service put the digital currency on FamilyMart\'s radar, leading it to consider accepting bitcoin for goods. According to BitoEX, the number of bitcoin purchases at FamilyMart has more than doubled year-on-year.\n\n""Since last year [FamilyMart] saw a growing number of bitcoin sales. That\'s why they were cautiously thinking about accepting bitcoin to see if it there\'s a bigger market out there,"" BitoEX\'s Chiang said.\n\nConvenience store chains in Taiwan have been at the forefront of experimentation with e-commerce. They were among the first retailers in Asia to become collection points for goods purchased online, for example.\n\nFamilyMart is Taiwan\'s second-largest convenience store chain by number of outlets, coming in behind 7-Eleven, which has about twice the number of stores. Taiwan is one of six international markets that the chain, headquartered in Tokyo, serves.\n\nGamers flocking to bitcoin\n\nA key segment of BitoEX\'s user base is gamers, Chiang said, accounting for 40% of the startup\'s customers. They\'re buying games or making in-game purchases on international platforms like Steam, Big Fish and PokerStart, Chiang said.\n\nSome gamers don\'t have access to a credit card or simply find Taiwan\'s ubiquitous convenience stores and their payment terminals to be an easier way to obtain the credit they need. Indeed, payment for games in Taiwan is a subject of discussion on gaming forums.\n\nIt\'s the gamers who are showing up at FamilyMarts across Taiwan – usually in the middle of the night – to make a quick run for soft drinks or snacks before returning to another marathon session. Sometimes they avail themselves of over-the-counter bitcoin as well, desperate for credit to advance in a game.\n\n""We noticed a lot of transactions taking place in the middle of the night, so we were curious. We found out they were gamers. Sometimes they say, \'Please give me bitcoin, I\'m in a hurry – I\'m in the middle of a game!\',"" Chiang said.\n\nBitoEX says the next biggest group of its customers are those using bitcoin for remittances, followed by investors and speculators.\n\nThe startup uses the mainland China-based exchange OKCoin for its bitcoin rates and liquidity.\n\nFeatured image: Images By Kenny / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The startups analyze bitcoin transactions for patterns and anomalies that might indicate criminal behavior.\n\nThe very existence of these startups raises questions about whether bitcoin users\' privacy can be protected as banks try to comply with regulations that require them to understand their customers.\n\nAnonymity, or more precisely pseudonymity, has always been a key feature of bitcoin. People and businesses (not all of them criminals) who don\'t want banks or the government to see their monetary transactions turn to bitcoin.\n\nBut the digital currency is not anonymous by default. Its public ledger, known as the blockchain, provides a trail of transactions that could be analyzed to find bad actors. It\'s possible to connect a bitcoin address (which is just an alphanumeric string) to a person or entity through network analysis, surveillance, or just Googling the address.\n\nTo bitcoin enthusiasts and privacy advocates, preserving the anonymity of bitcoin transactions is essential.\n\n""Freedom of private financial transactions is as important as freedom of speech,"" said Justus Ranvier, co-founder of the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project, a volunteer organization that rates the most popular bitcoin wallets on protecting users\' privacy. ""I believe in the long Western tradition of placing a premium on freedom of speech because we know the downsides of restricting it are so severe. I don\'t believe it\'s any different with money.""\n\nBanks that want to serve companies such as bitcoin exchanges or wallet providers know that to do so they must follow know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering rules. (Silicon Valley Bank and Barclays are among the institutions exploring the field.) The Bank for International Settlements argued in a recent paper that AML compliance for bitcoin will be a key part of keeping criminal behavior such as money laundering at bay:\n\nThe relative anonymity of digital currencies may make them especially susceptible to money laundering and other criminal activities. The usefulness of a digital currency for such purposes will depend on how much record-keeping the mechanism maintains about the transactions, how involved third-party service providers are in the transactions, whether such third parties comply with anti-money laundering requirements, and how easy it is to move digital currency across borders and convert that currency into sovereign currency.\n\nTo meet AML/KYC requirements, banks serving bitcoin-related businesses need to do certain things, such as look at the source and destination of funds, according to Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis. Companies need to know if money is coming from or going to sources they don\'t want to do business with.\n\n""Oftentimes fraud alerts will be triggered in other parts of the fraud detection process, and they will be linked to some bad activity on the blockchain, and that will serve as a three-point strike — someone flipped their bank account a number of times, then you see a connection to a dark market and you know that something bad is going on,"" Levin said. ""It\'s not necessarily the only check you\'re going to be able to do, but there is some expectation that financial intermediaries should be doing source and destination of funds type analysis.""\n\nBanks need to be aware of what their customers are doing, though not necessarily what their customers\' customers are doing, he said.\n\n""If I onboard someone like Western Union, I might know the volumes they put through, the frequency, the velocity, so when wires come in that don\'t match that, I need to be talking to my Western Union counterpart and understanding what happened there,"" he said. ""Very similar stuff happens for bitcoin money service businesses. Because you\'re stepping into potentially a high-risk business, you would want to look at high-level metrics about what that company is doing."" This is where services like Chainalysis come in, to conduct that analysis and provide an overall understanding of what the business is up to.\n\nEven this kind of big-picture monitoring of the public ledger unsettles bitcoin\'s privacy-conscious early adopters.\n\n""The way I see it, if their business is viable, then our work is incomplete,"" Ranvier said. ""As long as Chainalysis has a viable business model, we know we have room for improvement.""\n\nRanvier acknowledged that the bitcoin ledger is a public record. ""Even if I were to say they don\'t have the right to, that doesn\'t stop anyone from analyzing the blockchain,"" he said.\n\nBut if anyone can compromise bitcoin users\' privacy, ""we see that as a bug that should be fixed, and we try to brainstorm ways to encourage software developers to close those bugs,"" Ranvier said.\n\nShortly after the terrorist attacks in Paris last month, several news outlets reported that the Islamic State was using bitcoin wallets to store and manage millions of dollars\' worth of the currency. No proof was provided, however.\n\nBut even if evidence showed terrorists were using bitcoin, privacy stalwarts see other dangers from government or private-sector snooping.\n\n""Every technique that has a legitimate law enforcement use also has an illegitimate use for organized crime or political repression of dissidents,"" Ranvier said. ""This is very much a two-edged sword. You could always come up with a scenario in which taking away privacy will cause a benefit in a certain situation, but the conversation never seems to talk about all the ways that power can be abused.""\n\nTo former FDIC chairman William Isaac, the questions around how banks should handle KYC/AML compliance in the bitcoin realm are part of a broader need to review compliance rules that affect access to banking services.\n\n""More and more people, companies, and countries are being denied access to the services of the banking system — particularly those with lower incomes who need it most,"" said Isaac, who is now senior managing director and global head of financial services at FTI Consulting in Sarasota, Fla. ""What is the societal cost of this, what benefits flow from it, and are there less intrusive and more efficient ways to get the information we are seeking? Are we driving the money underground were it can\'t be tracked? Should we require greater protection by insisting on search warrants?""\n\nNo one should hold their breath waiting for bank regulations to change. Banks will have to tread lightly and communicate with their regulators as well as the bitcoin and privacy communities as they take their tentative first steps into bitcoin banking.\n\nPenny Crosman is American Banker\'s editor at large.

12/02/2015,"['Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bitcoin is still unregulated in many countries\n\nTwo US Bitcoin mining firms have been charged with running a scheme that duped more than 10,000 investors.\n\nGAW Miners and ZenMiner are accused of selling shares worth $20m (£13.3m) in mining hardware called Hashlets.\n\nBitcoins are ""mined"" when computers solve equations that verify user transactions made with the currency.\n\nBut it is claimed that Hashlets did not have enough processing power to carry out the number of verifications required to properly reward investors.\n\nGAW and ZenMiner were owned by Homero Joshua Garza, who has been charged in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint filed in a federal court in Connecticut.\n\n""As alleged in our complaint, Garza and his companies cloaked their scheme in technological sophistication and jargon, but the fraud was simple at its core: they sold what they did not own, misrepresented what they were selling, and robbed one investor to pay another,"" said Paul Levenson, director of the SEC\'s Boston regional office.\n\n\'Ponzi scheme\'\n\nThe SEC has alleged that Mr Garza\'s companies were engaged in what\'s known as a Ponzi scheme, in which investors were owed more than the mining machines were able to make and pay out to them each day.\n\nAs a result, it is claimed that most were never able to recoup the value of their initial investments, while a few made some profit.\n\nMr Garza was said to be ""disappointed"" by the charges, according to a statement from his lawyer, Marjorie Peerce,\n\nAny further comments, she added, would be made through the court process.\n\nBitcoin blues\n\nGenerally, fraud in the Bitcoin world is on the increase, according to Richard Howlett, a partner at London law firm Selachii, which advises clients on legal issues relating to crypto-currencies.\n\n""There are several high-profile Bitcoin exchanges I am aware of which appear to be Ponzi schemes,"" he said.\n\nMr Howlett added that Bitcoin users sometimes also encountered difficulties when trying to retrieve currency stored in online ""exchanges"" - a bit like personal banks for Bitcoins.\n\nOn occasion, a rogue exchange might shut down overnight and claim it was hacked, said Mr Howlett. Those running the exchange would then disappear with the clients\' funds.\n\nSince 2014, Mr Howlett\'s firm has been contacted by more than 1,000 people affected by rogue exchanges and mining companies.\n\n""Until the industry is regulated, this pattern will continue to increase,"" he added.', 'Goldman Sachs has developed its own cryptocurrency for a settlement system for trading stocks, bonds and other assets, according to a recently published patent filing.\n\nThe New York-based financial giant made a patent application last year for a new virtual currency called SETLCoin, which makes it easier and faster to trade securities and settle those trades. (The patent application was published only recently, a typical lag between patent applications and when they are made public by the US Patent and Trademark Office.) The patent was first reported by Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nWhile the trading desks at the world’s top financial institutions often rely on lightning fast technology to execute trades, it can still take days before the promised cash and securities—such as stocks and bonds—actually change hands, a process known as settlement.\n\nThat gap between the time the trades are executed and the settlement of the trade is a risk for traders. (It’s always possible that the person you were trading with goes bankrupt before they deliver the cash or securities you are expecting.) Goldman Sachs says in the patent application that SETLCoin guarantees “nearly instantaneous execution and settlement” for trades.\n\nWhile SETLCoin is a virtual currency, it isn’t bitcoin, which adds to the growing evidence that financial institutions are less interested bitcoin itself and more interested in the technology behind bitcoin, known as blockchain.\n\nA global consortium of banks is working with blockchain startup R3 to develop approaches to using blockchain in global finance. American Express recently took part in a $12 million investment in Abra, a start-up that uses blockchain to transfer money internationally. In September, Blockchain startup Chain raised a $30 million Series B round with big names like Visa, Nasdaq, and Citi taking part in the investment. Goldman Sachs itself has also been actively exploring the bitcoin space. The firm was recently part of a $50 million investment round in Circle, a payments app that utilizes bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nGoldman’s patent application for SETLCoin might suggest that as they become more familiar with the technology themselves, banks and financial institutions could step-up their own development of blockchain technology.', 'Bitcoin and Blockchain technology are very young and novel for millions of people all over the world. Moreover, several countries are still arguing about the status of this FinTech innovation, and how they could use it in the local financial industry. The same situation applies to India where Bitcoin and Blockchain face a miryad of problems in the country.\n\nVishal Gupta is the Founder of Bitcoin Alliance India, CEO at SearchTrade, and Director at Moving Trumpet. CoinTelegraph turned to Vishal Gupta to find out what are the main problems with Bitcoin and Blockchain development in India.\n\nCT: How difficult is it to promote Bitcoin and Blockchain in India? Which problems do these technologies face in the country?\n\nVishal Gupta: Key challenges in promoting Blockchain is around educating people about how it works to start with. Bitcoin on the other hand is very easy to promote but existing capital controls and lack of investment in mining has hampered the growth of the bitcoin market. Of course, there is general fear amongst investors and users around the legality of the use of bitcoin.\n\n“If we can get past the legality debate we can build a robust bitcoin marketplace in India.”\n\nCT: What is the main role of Bitcoin Alliance India? Is it a bridge between government and market?\n\nVG: Bitcoin Alliance India (BAI) is a Bitcoin think tank based out of India that was created with the objective of understanding implications and opportunities around bitcoin in India. At BAI we have consulted many experts in the field of law and taxation to understand how bitcoin fits into the Indian legal and tax system. We have made many presentations to various government bodies and deliberated with them on the subject.\n\nCT: What is the legal approach to Bitcoin and Blockchain in the country?\n\nVG: There are no adverse regulations other than getting past strict foreign remittance capital controls, which makes it almost impossible to buy or trade bitcoin overseas. Blockchain has applications beyond financial transactions, it can be used for providing or delivering e-governance services in a transparent way.\n\n""I have spent lot of time with lawyers and accountants to understand regulation and tax implications around bitcoin in India, the conclusion is they are legal and there is a clear taxation framework available but there are few no go areas like overseas remittances.""\n\nThe Blockchain itself attracts no regulations but challenges are around building and showcasing products and services to potential customers at large. There are very few functional demos that demonstrate practical blockchain use in daily life and the benefits it might have for businesses and consumers. There needs to be a lot of investment in Research & Development before it can be applied to mainstream applications.\n\nCT: How does the Indian government treat cryptocurrecny?\n\nVG: The blockchain is essentially a distributed database so it attracts no regulations or controls from the government what so ever. They treat it as a piece of technology. Bitcoin is a more complex issue, since there is no definition of what bitcoin is. Therefore, what laws or regulations apply on bitcoin primarily depend on the nature of the business itself. There are no restriction on buying or selling bitcoins or selling goods and services with bitcoin. Opening exchanges and trading platforms are a grey area. Remittance is absolute no go area, wallets services are legal, while exchanges and trading are grey because financial services in general are heavily regulated in India. But since bitcoin is not classified as a currency it escapes those regulations.\n\nCT: Are local banks friendly to Bitcoin and Blockchain innovations?\n\nVG: We have not seen a lot of interest from banks in India around Blockchain innovations as yet primarily because there are not enough solutions to showcase as yet. However, when we meet bankers at conferences they do seem very interested in learning more about blockchain technology and its application in the banking sector.\n\n“Bitcoin is a taboo for bankers for now mostly because there is no clear policy framework provided by the regulators yet but there are lots of trading platforms that are operating with bank accounts in India without any issues.”\n\nCT: Everyone talks about the integration of India into the world financial market. Does that concerns the Indian crypto industry as well? Do you have some established contacts with markets in other countries?\n\nVG: India is already well integrated with global financial markets but there are restrictions and regulations in place to control capital outflows, for instance Indian citizens cannot invest beyond $250K in foreign investments. These issues create barriers in terms of ease of investing in financial markets abroad as a result buying bitcoin from a foreign exchange is difficult and cumbersome in terms of paperwork and compliance investors must endure.\n\nThese challenges make it difficult to build business relationships with overseas exchanges and trading platforms hence hampering the growth of the Bitcoin marketplace in India.\n\nCT: Which Indian companies provide Bitcoin and Blockchain solutions to deal with the existing problems of the Indian crypto industry?\n\nVG: There are a few good bitcoin trading and wallet businesses in India that have built good reputation for themselves over the past 2 years of operations such as ZebPay, Coinsecure and Unocoin. Other than few minor issues they have delivered services efficiently and are well engaged with their customers. Most of them also conduct bitcoin awareness campaigns at colleges and trade events which is helping expand the marketplace gradually.\n\nCT: What problem does your own project solve?\n\nVG: SearchTrade was created with the objective of presenting an alternate business model for internet businesses by using inherent micro-payment advantages of bitcoin to deliver value. At SearchTrade we are building a search engine that shares its revenue with its users for searching on our platform. These searches are responsible for the income the platform generates. Moreover, we also allow our users to own keywords (Words used in a Search Query) and earn bitcoin income every time the keywords they own becomes part of a search query.\n\nSearch is the starting point for most internet users which guides them to relevant websites and content based on their queries, we believe the wealth this process generates needs to be re-distributed back to users.', '', 'The largest Ukrainian Bitcoin agency KUNA announces the launch of a crowdsale campaign for its cryptocurrency exchange. KUNA’s Bitcoin exchange was launched in March 2014 to allow customers easily and safely convert digital currency in local (UAH). The founder of KUNA agency Michael Chobanian announced the preparation of required financial documents for the crowdfunding on the December 2.\n\nHowever, considering the centralized control over cryptocurrency exchange services in Ukraine, KUNA exchange found it difficult to continue its work without major innovations. Secondly, there is no legal model for the cryptocurrency exchange that would not require strict limitation of turnover. Thus, Bitcoin exchange market in Ukraine is one of the most expensive in the world – fees for exchange are 3-5%.\n\nKUNA have found a legal solution that allows to create Ukrainian Bitcoin exchanges that has need to use centralized bank accounts and restrictions on turnover. This will lower the overall fees to 1% for exchanges between BTC\\UAH. Moreover, exchange will create a center of liquidity and will become Ukraine’s basic infrastructure for FinTech projects development (like BTMs, remittance services, payment providers, banking etc) for local and foreign markets.\n\nThe crowdsale begins on December 13, 2015 and will last till December 24, 2015. During the investments seed round KUNA will offer 10% shares of the future Bitcoin exchange.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Blockchains are set to go mainstream. As opposed to bitcoin – the currency – the underlying blockchain technology is embraced by prominent companies, banks, and even governments. A brand new industry is emerging based on this technological advancement that allows multiple entities to agree on a single version of a database with no need for a trusted third party.\n\nHowever, much of this blockchain industry does not actually use Bitcoin's blockchain. Rather, several startups are building various types of blockchains, or shared-ledger technology that uses some of Blockchain's efficiencies. There is a simple reason for this strategy: Bitcoin's architecture is limiting in scope.\n\nHowever, some properties of Bitcoin's blockchain are unmatched; it is, by far, the most secure open and decentralized ledger out there. That's why a new wave of blockchain-startups, including companies such as Factom, Tierion and DocuSign, is now seeking to marry the best of both worlds.\n\nThey use Bitcoin as an anchoring technology, used to secure alternative chains and data layers.\n\nLimitations & Security\n\nPeter Kirby is the CEO of Factom, a well-known blockchain startup which is building a data layer on top of Bitcoin, and working on a land registry program with the Honduran government. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Kirby explained why it makes sense for companies to avoid using Bitcoin in some cases.\n\nYou don't see a lot of really, really advanced stuff being built on Bitcoin, because Bitcoin has some major limitation,” Kirby said. “Obviously there's a speed limitation; you need to wait 10 minutes for transactions to confirm, and sometimes you want three, maybe six confirmations. But you don't always have an hour to wait on an application. Additionally, there's a cost issue. If bitcoin's value goes way, way up, it means all your costs change. And finally, the most important one, there is a capacity issue. Bitcoin can't handle more than, like, seven transactions per second.”\n\nBut that does not mean Bitcoin's blockchain is useless, Kirby emphasized. One property of Bitcoin's blockchain has been impossible to copy so far: its unique security proposition. Bitcoin's immutability relies on mining power to secure the network against 51 percent attacks. In other words, it uses computing power to stop anyone from “changing the past.”\n\nAnd, over the last six years, Bitcoin has garnered a record amount of hashing power.\n\nBitcoin is an amazing network, and it's got a lot of horsepower; some 500 petahash worth,” Kirby continued. “If you think of blockchains as a brick-stacking machine, where every time you write something you stack bricks on top of that, Bitcoin stacks the most bricks by 100,000 times. For every brick that another system stacks, Bitcoin stacks a ton.”\n\nAnchoring\n\nThis unique security proposition has opened the door to a new application of the original Bitcoin blockchain: anchoring. Rather than transmitting and processing all information, some of the newer blockchains and alternative data-layers do most of the work on their own chain or ledger, and simply tap into Bitcoin's security without putting a big footprint into the system.\n\nThis is done using cryptographic tools called Merkle trees. Data – any type of data – can be scrambled and compressed into a hash: a seemingly random string of numbers. This hash can be much shorter than the original data, but is also impossible to unscramble, deeming it useless to anyone who doesn't have the original data. But anyone who does have the original data can scramble that data in the exact same manner. If the hash turns out the same, it essentially verifies that the original hash was made using the same data.\n\nA Merkle tree, then, consists of multiple hashes hashed together into a new hash, called a Merkle root. As such, hundreds of pieces of data can all be compressed into a Merkle root. And using the magic of cryptography, anyone who has any of the original data can use the Merkle root to check whether that original data is part of the Merkle tree.\n\nMajor companies such as Philips are experimenting with Bitcoin’s blockchain using Merkle trees. The electronics and health care giant recently established a partnership with Tierion, a blockchain startup that lets users create a verifiable record of any data, file, or business process on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nElaborating on the specifics of this approach, Tierion CEO Wayne Vaughan told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\nTierion can anchor millions of records in the blockchain, even though Bitcoin can only handle seven transactions per second. Every 10 minutes we construct a Merkle tree of the recently received records and publish the Merkle root in a Bitcoin transaction. Tierion uses information from this process to create a blockchain receipt for each individual record. Anyone with a blockchain reciept can verify the contents and timestamp of a record, without even needing to know about Tierion. They can just check the Bitcoin blockchain.”\n\nExplaining why this might be useful, Vaughan said:\n\nImagine you're a manufacturer with a complex purchasing process. You can connect your existing procurement systems to Tierion, or one of the other tools that anchors data in the Bitcoin blockchain, to timestamp and verify the contents of each purchase order and approval. This lets you create a verifiable audit trail of a purchasing process that spans multiple partners.”\n\nThis strategy is even being adopted by legacy payment systems. Visa recently announced a partnership with DocuSign to publish contracts on Bitcoin's blockchain while using the existing payments rails as provides by Visa itself.\n\nIn our DocuSign/Visa connected car example, we’re generating transaction information and posting it to an open system which provides a secure, tamper-proof container which is also time-stamped,” DocuSign founder and Chief Strategy Officer Tom Gonser said. “This container can then be accessed by any application to pick up our transaction and process it, knowing that it is authentic.”\n\nThe future of Bitcoin 2.0\n\nThese companies, therefore, believe anchoring could very well be the future of Bitcoin as a 2.0 technology. Bitcoin itself might never be the platform that's used to record every single stock trade, or all the world's data. But it could evolve to be a fundamental and secure base layer, on which more advanced solutions are constructed. Bitcoin is being rediscovered as a building block, much like the IP layer of the internet itself.\n\nTCP/IP moves the data packets, HTTP manages images and visualization, and then fancy stuff like Flash and HTML5 get built on top of that,” Kirby said. “We think that blockchain technology will be built the same way. Bitcoin at the core, and a data layer on top on which you write stuff... fancy applications like Storj and distributed computing like Ethereum on top of that...”\n\nHe added, “The world of banking and finance is kind of apprehensive about Bitcoin in general; they're always coming up with reasons why Bitcoin is not perfect. But it doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be there.”\n\nVaughan agreed.""]"
12/03/2015,"[""Jim Burton, the British lead developer of “lightweight” Bitcoin client MultiBit, favors a rapid block-size increase in order to allow for more transactions on the network, rather than focusing on layers built on top of Bitcoin.\n\n“Philosophically, we think that Satoshi's vision of a peer-to-peer currency needs bigger blocks,” Burton told Bitcoin Magazine. We want people to be able to transact person-to-person 'on-chain'. We are starting to see large transaction backlogs, for instance recently on Black Friday, so the need for bigger blocks is clear.”\n\nThe block-size dispute – which represents a trade-off between the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle and its decentralization – seems to be reaching decisive weeks. A large segment of Bitcoin's academic and engineering community will discuss the question of how best to scale Bitcoin at the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong on the 6th and 7th of this month, while several prominent Bitcoin companies have stated they intend to change their code to allow for bigger blocks within the next weeks.\n\nBurton acknowledged that bigger blocks might add centralization risk to Bitcoin’s network, but he said he believes these are manageable. Additionally, the MultiBit developer hopes that the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong might help establish solutions for moving forward.\n\n“As for the cost of running a full node, any company running a Bitcoin-based service will probably want to run at least one Bitcoin Core or XT node to ensure the data they are using is accurate,” Burton said. “And while bigger blocks need software engineering to improve propagation, this is the focus of the two 'Scaling Bitcoin' conferences.\n\n“We will not be attending the conference in Hong Kong ourselves, but will be following the event closely,’ he added. “Most people I have spoken to about the block-size limit want to see action rather than a prolonged debate, so I am hoping we will see a clear path forward in the next couple of months.”\n\nCurrently, there are several proposals and ideas to increase Bitcoin's block-size limit. The solution to increase the block size designed by Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen, BIP 101, was implemented into alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT last summer, and is programmed to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years for 20 years, ultimately leading to an 8-gigabyte block-size limit.\n\nAnother idea that has been gathering support is Blockstream CEO and Hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back's “2-4-8” quick fix, which would incrementally increase to the limit to 8 megabytes in three steps over four years time.\n\nOther proposals – both regarding the block-size limit and concerning alternative scaling solutions – will be discussed in Hong Kong this week as well.\n\nWhile Burton, whose MultiBit was launched more than four years ago, believes the block-size should limit should be increased soon, he did not give a clear preference for the type of solution.\n\n“We are fortunate that the architecture of both MultiBit Classic and MultiBit HD is agnostic to the block size. Both versions will happily connect to either Bitcoin Core or XT, and should work without change for any of the proposed block sizes,” Burton said. “We would be very pleased to see BIP 101 implemented, but if the consensus is that increasing it '2-4-8' is a safer procedure we would be happy to see that, too.”\n\nLastly, Burton indicated he is in favor of additional scaling solutions, such as layers built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, as long as the scalability doesn’t solely rely on it.\n\n“Additional layers on top of Bitcoin such as the Lightning Network will also be needed to scale Bitcoin,” he said. “But it is not an 'either/or' situation. We can do both.”"", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Much has been made this week of the news that combined trading on bitcoin exchanges has reached a record high. As the BTC/USD exchange rate has climbed towards $400, so exchange volume has risen to close to 4 million bitcoin a day. As this Coindesk article points out, there are some who believe that the reported numbers are questionable and may be inflated by “fake trades” designed to give some exchanges the appearance of liquidity but, as with price, trading volume is not the metric to which those who believe in the future of bitcoin should be paying attention.\n\nI will freely admit that what first drew me into the world of crypto currencies was the volatility of bitcoin’s exchange rate and therefore its potential as a trading instrument. I make it a point not to trade anything that I don’t understand though, and as I dug deeper into the subject the whole concept began to intrigue me. Bitcoin is not just another commodity, it is something that has the potential to fundamentally change the way we think about money and could ultimately be a huge force for good in the world.\n\nCall me an idealist if you will, but it seems to me that taking the inflation risk out of the equation for entrepreneurs in developing nations has the capacity to encourage more business activity on a small scale. It has the potential to offer economic freedom to people who have been denied it in the past and the innovation and expansion that would come with that would benefit us all.\n\nIn order to achieve that, however, bitcoin must make the transition from trading instrument to currency. It can no longer just be viewed just as a kind of commodity without an end use. The European Court’s ruling to that effect this year was a huge step forward in that regard, but if the potential is to be fulfilled then the next step, the wider acceptance of the currency as both a means of exchange and a legitimate way to settle an obligation, has to come. That, in turn, depends on the rate of adoption, but also on how many transactions actually take place.\n\nThe news there for bitcoin this year has been mixed. Growth in the number of merchants accepting digital currency for goods and services seems to have stalled, even as the number of actual transactions via the blockchain continues to increase rapidly. Logically though, if the second trend can continue then it will have a beneficial effect on the first, and there is no sign of transaction volume slowing down. In fact the number of blockchain transactions has nearly doubled this year as the above chart from Blockchain.info makes abundantly clear.\n\nWhen all is said and done, no matter how much one bitcoin is worth in conventional currency, nor how many trades are done on exchanges, it is this inexorable rise that tells the tale. As long as it continues those who dismiss digital currency as some kind of fad are simply incorrect and will end up on the wrong side of history.', 'On November 14th, Gemini Bitcoin exchange personnel put in place a Trade Reversal on a transaction that happened few hours earlier on their systems.

Here is the results.\n\nThe beginning\n\nTo summarize the events, on November 13th, Mike placed a large Bitcoin buy market order to fill various limit prices up to $2,200 per Bitcoin.

We can’t know, and it surely isn’t Mike’s business.\n\nThe transaction went through, there was no system malfunction, and everything looked fine.\n\nTo say it in other words: it was entirely the buyer’s error, as later confirmed by Gemini executives.\n\nDespite this, few hours later the trade reversal happened.\n\nDiscrepancies Between Gemini’s TOL And Company Action\n\nMike states that, according to the Gemini’s Terms Of License (TOL) document, they couldn’t do it.\n\nIndeed, the fact that the transaction was completed meant that the buyer had funds, and the (supposed) system checks for abnormal orders didn’t block it either.\n\nMike explains that the TOL:\n\n“Makes the user think that if they submit an abnormal market order that would pass a certain boundary that is abnormal, that it is instantly flagged and held before it will be processed allowing for addition confirmation from the staff. A certain scenario where this situation should kick in might be a user wants to limit buy for $220, but accidentally messes up and puts an extra zero. Regardless of how much bitcoin they wanted to buy or what type of trade (market/limit) they wanted to do, Gemini’s automated compliance checks should have kicked in because this trade would have bought bitcoin up and through an “undetermined or unknown to users” percentage threshold that could be considered “outside the boundary” of current trades or outside the normal trading range for that specific user and therefore subject for further review. In their terms of service, Gemini does not state this as a qualifying event for a trade reversal and assumes no liability to either party.”\n\nIn his public report, Mike explains in detail the events on the timeline, including contacts with the Gemini help desk, also lamenting long waiting times, and the fact that he never received an email signed by somebody: he was talking to “Gemini” in general. It’s like talking to a ghost, and in the end it’s a shield: you can’t blame anybody for false declarations or possible mistakes in the future.\n\nMike also mentions the fact that in a Gemini email was written that the event was completely due to user error, but in the TOL there’s no mention of actions due from Gemini in this case:\n\n“This is the only section that informs a user of possible trade reversals [in case of system malfunction]. The Gemini trading mechanism/engine had no malfunction/disruption/lag/etc. at the time of the trade and the cause of orders being filled up to $2,200 was due to “customer error” as stated in Gemini’s email response. There have been people to agree with the actions of Gemini reversing the trade on grounds that this trade caused a “severe business disruption.” Or that “trade reversals happen all the time on the stock market” because they have to comply the SEC’s rules. However, I cannot seem to find documentation specific to trade reversals or clearly erroneous trades in a situation like this.”\n\nIt seems that all the possible options treated in the TOL wouldn’t have allowed Gemini to apply this trade reversal at all, and while they will probably be updating the document now, Mike could be on the right side in this case.\n\nThe Opinion Of The Expert\n\nTo dig deeper in the matter we contacted Stefano Debolini, Associate at Sheridans Law Practice from London, expert in EULAs, Terms Of Use, Software As A Service and related matters, and the case doesn’t look like an easy one:\n\n“It is certainly a complex issue. Firstly, as some have mentioned, there are numerous exclusions of liability on the part of Gemini which may be sufficient to limit its exposure if, in fact, the actions it has taken would otherwise give rise to a breach of contract or other claim. The law can also step in under certain situations where a mistake is clear and recognisable and promptly exploited, to void a contract. For example, there have been cases where sellers have accidentally made an offer by weight rather than per item, and where staff have mixed up prices, and the courts have, in some cases, not upheld a transaction. However, this is a slightly different situation, the question being whether the platform provider is at fault rather than the counterparties, and there is arguably scope in the terms for the exchange to reverse certain transactions (although, whether or not that applies here is not necessarily clear-cut).”\n\nAdditionally, the problem could get even more mazy thanks to international laws that could affect it:\n\n“Laws also differ between countries and states, and each incident needs to be considered in that context. When it comes to financial services and other regulated industries, there are also swathes of specialised regulations which you need to bear in mind. So, it’s not possible to give you a firm view with a brief comment here. What is clear, is that this kind of incident will have a reputational impact. Some have argued that the Gemini user agreement was unclear when it comes to trade reversals, while others might say a sophisticated user would recognise this buy order as an error and it would be unreasonable to expect it to be filled. Whatever your take on it, there is potential for this to damage the brand, although in the long run it could be an opportunity to take steps to transparently increase trust in the platform, taking advantage of the exposure. Ultimately, businesses should take care to manage expectations, and to my mind, supposedly accidental orders like this are a risk worth mentioning explicitly to users in a relevant policy.”\n\nIt seems that at least the Gemini TOL is/was not transparent, or incomplete.\n\nIncomplete\n\nWe contacted Gemini by email to let them say their point of view on the event. One representative answered, and we communicated to them info about the case. But then, after over one week of waiting and solicitations, we didn’t receive an answer.\n\nFrom Mike’s story and these days of silence it really seems that Gemini personnel doesn’t have time or wish to treat people decently, or are they overburdened with work?\n\nAnyway, apart from the legal proceeding, that have to finally decide about Mike’s happening, the final question here is moral: if there was an error from a buyer, would you allow to reverse the trade?\n\nWatching it from another side, you will never stop people to make “games” to try to trick the systems, and it’s completely legit. Trading itself is, after all, about the most clever on the square: if you slip your finger on the mouse, you bring your error and its consequences to your home.', ""I became interested in Bitcoin during the fall of 2013, while leading the inside sales team for Oracle's open source support in Kansas and Iowa. Our territory isn't the first states that come to mind when one thinks of technology and financial innovation; our customers were the excellent university systems, as well as staid financial service companies and enterprises in Des Moines and the western suburbs of Kansas City.\n\nStarting in August I watched every video and read every white paper I could get my hands on that contained the all important keyword “blockchain”, which I had learned was the underlying technology enabling Bitcoin. I attended Bitcoin related events in the Bay Area and I shared my fascination at work, so much so that my coworkers began calling me “that Bitcoin guy”. Across the hall, so to speak, in the technology side of Oracle was another Bitcoin guy, John Lindsay. A mutual friend noticed our shared interest, arranged for an introduction, and we began plotting.\n\nThe field was already full of cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and payment processors. We engaged in a gap analysis, looking for something unique that would have ongoing transactions, which didn't depend on speculation. John realized that there was nothing happening in terms of payroll processing. Remember that in late 2013 each Bitcoin was worth over $1,000 and bitcoin insiders believed that mass adoption was right around the corner.\n\nIn preparation for the launching of our first product, both John and I made the leap. We quit our nice, comfortable jobs at Oracle in early June of 2014 and went full time at Bitwage, funding our operations with our savings. One month later, we released our Bitcoin payroll system in July of 2014 and the process of sharing our vision began, albeit slowly. Freelancers and contractors who were already educated on Bitcoin were ready to receive payment in that form. Employers were much less receptive due to payroll compliance concerns. We listened, we watched what our customers were doing, and in November of 2014 we released Bitcoin Payroll for Individuals. Our users could elect to receive a portion of their pay in the form of Bitcoin, with no involvement on the part of their employer beyond setting up a direct deposit.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin tumbled from it's $1,000+ peak to as low as $350 at some points in 2014. Even though our company finances were not impacted (we do not hold an inventory of bitcoin), we feared that the lower value would stunt our user growth. Instead, while the price was falling we were picking up new users faster. Interestingly, these new users were signing up from specific geographical areas, rather than coming from vertical markets where Bitcoin was already the norm. Taking this as a sign we had missed something, we studied the usage patterns and contacted some of our customers to learn more of their motivations.\n\nArgentine freelancers were waiting five days, giving up 40% of their income during that process, and some times their payments were simply lost in an opaque, slow moving system. Their only other alternative to losing 30% of their wage was getting on a boat to Uruguay to pick up their funds. Through us, Argentine freelancers were receiving wage payments from the U.S. or western Europe to Argentina in a day, at a cost of 1% of the amount, from the comfort of their home. After receiving their wages, the freelancers would figure out how to get their local currency on their own."", 'Could digital currencies improve financial conditions in war-torn countries? Boston University\'s Center for Finance, Law and Policy (CFLP) has convened a task force to explore whether they can.\n\nThe research effort, which began earlier this year, follows on the heels of an October 2013 report on remittances in regions of beset by strife and turmoil. That report had a particular focus on the Middle East and Africa, and did not analyze digital currencies.\n\nFrom Commonwealth central bankers to major credit card networks, digital currencies have been cited by many observers as a possible game-changer for the world of remittances, despite pushback from industry incumbents.\n\nOrganizations such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have also begun looking at blockchain implementations as a means of developing new payment systems for the unbanked.\n\nThe task force is being led by Daivi Rodima-Taylor and William W Grimes of the CFLP, an interdisciplinary research initiative focused on financial issues. The CFLP recently hosted a panel that explored bitcoin and the blockchain and how they might fit into the broader world of formal and informal remittance flows.\n\nModerated by Circle’s John Beccia, panelists included Counterparty community manager Chris DeRose, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman attorney Marco Santori and entrepreneur Joshua Unseth.\n\nRodima-Taylor believes that in regions where financial infrastructure, particularly central banks, aren’t functioning, digital currencies as a technology offered a means to enhance what is already a diverse ecosystem of remittance methods.\n\nShe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Financial technology innovations such as digital currencies have offered productive solutions for the remittance sector for some time now, and have a potential to revolutionize transnational remittance transfers particularly in fragile and post-conflict contexts.""\n\nAccording to Grimes, the task force assembled by the CFLP ""seeks to understand the potential for mobile and digital technologies to reduce costs and increase efficiency of money transfer to developing countries, as well as any potential legal or political downsides"", and will focus on other forms of electronic remittance in addition to digital currencies like bitcoin.\n\nRemittance in digital form\n\nAccording to the mission statement for the new task force, digital currencies like bitcoin ""are creating additional opportunities for more efficient remittance transfers"" yet, at the same time, ""create certain risks and challenges"".\n\nThe statement outlines how the research will take place against the backdrop of a broader look at digital money mechanisms in conflict nations, explaining:\n\n""The Task Force research examines the emerging opportunities for social as well as technological innovation within digital currency communities and networks, and within emerging technological and institutional hybrids as digital currencies engage with various forms of mobile and traditional banking.""\n\nRodima-Taylor told CoinDesk that, according to her past research, the growth of private remittance methods often comes ""amid a breakdown of formal financial institutions and poorly functioning governments"".\n\nPointing to examples like hawala, a trust-based payment system dating back to the Middle Ages, Rodima-Taylor said that informal money flows “draw upon existing social institutions and culturally embedded solidarity networks”.\n\nShe continued:\n\n""In fragile situations such as Somalia where a systemic risk of anti-money-laundering remains, digital currencies become especially important as offering potentially secure and legible alternatives for remittance transfers. These decentralized and peer-to-peer systems do not rely on central banking infrastructure, making them suitable for these chaotic environments.""\n\nConflict breeds innovation\n\nRodima-Taylor also cited past examples, including the development of informal remittance channels in Somalia in the 1990s amid the region’s long-running civil conflict, as ways in which new technology is opportunistically seized upon to help solve societal challenge – in this case, the movement of money.\n\nShe continued:\n\n""As a result, conflict-ridden Somalia developed one of the most advanced telecommunication infrastructures in Africa at that time, demonstrating how conflict can fuel technological adaptations and competition.""\n\nAdaptation amid regional strife, Rodima-Taylor continued, has been seen to lead to scenarios in which mixtures of private and more public form of remittance take shape.\n\n""As the cases of post-conflict Afghanistan and Somalia have shown, local creative combinations of existing remittance institutions and novel technological opportunities can harness adaptive potentials even in the contexts of widespread devastation,"" she told CoinDesk. ""They can also produce novel opportunities for formal sector engagement and result in viable \'hybrid\' arrangements.""\n\nLow adoption casts doubt\n\nGrimes told CoinDesk that, for now, digital currencies haven’t reached the scale of adoption that would make them a clear cost-reducer in a remittance context.\n\nThe need for individuals to purchase a digital currency using a government-backed currency and then send that digital currency, he said, entails an added step that adds additional expenditure and risk.\n\n""For the moment, the main problem for digital currencies in the remittance space is that none are widely used in developing countries themselves, so any use for remittances must depend on two exchange transactions, which means both transaction costs and currency risks,"" Grimes said. ""And given the volatility of the value of bitcoin, it remains somewhat problematic as a store of value.""\n\nShould broader adoption happen, he continued, the potential advantages of using a digital currency to remit funds could become more apparent:\n\n""A big question for digital currencies in remittances, as with all remittance methods, remains cost. If and when digital currencies become more widely used in the developing world and societies get used to them, they may be an important new vehicle for addressing the needs of those societies.""\n\nImage credit: Alexandre Rotenberg / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Like these organizations, Fidelity reports that customer acceptance and interest in the idea were the motivating factors behind the move.\n\nIn interview, Fidelity Charitable senior vice president Matt Nash affirmed that the organization has a vested interest in listening to its customers and making its offerings as ""broad"" as possible.\n\nNash told CoinDesk:\n\n""What we’re finding is that for more Americans, as more people use and invest in digital currencies, they’ll tap those resources to do good.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Blockchain technology is one of the hottest trends in the finance scene, with the potential to completely transform traditional business models in a number of sectors. Blockchain works similarly to a massive digital spreadsheet, which is shared by all the members of a decentralized network. While blockchain technology is most frequently associated with confirming Bitcoin payments, it can also be used in a number of other ways. Since Bitcoin has become more widely accepted by the mainstream, it has been valued at almost $6 billion.\n\nAlong with a rapidly expanding user base, Bitcoin is now being considered by a number of financial services companies. Paramount among the benefits offered by cryptocurrency is the ability to reduce the cost of transferring funds, particularly on a global scale. The impact of Bitcoin, and the technology behind it, on the finance industry has been likened to the disruption that the Internet caused on the music and publishing industries. (For related reading, see: The Future of Cryptocurrency.)\n\nIn light of tremendous promise, investors have already begun to look at how they can tap into the profit potential of blockchain technology. Given the nature of blockchain technology, prior to making any investment decisions, there are certain unique factors to consider that differ from traditional investments. The good news is that opportunities for investing in blockchain technology abound, giving investors at every level the chance to leverage the potential offered by this revolutionary technology. How an investor chooses to invest in blockchain technology will largely depend on the amount of risk he or she is willing to incur, as well as the type of yield they wish to achieve.\n\n1. Stockpiling Bitcoin\n\nJust as many investors have taken advantage of the opportunity to stockpile gold in anticipation of the rising price, other investors are taking advantage of the opportunity to stockpile Bitcoin. Although the two assets are different, in that gold is a tangible item and Bitcoin is not, many of the basic investment principles remain the same. For instance, both assets are considered rare. While the rate at which Bitcoins were generated in the early days of the technology was relatively fast, that rate has slowed over the last few years as the technology reached its built-in limit of 21 million coins. (For more, see: Blockchain Technology To Revolutionize Traditional Banking.)\n\nIt all comes down to simple supply and demand. With limited supply, as demand increases, value also rises. If you are under the impression that the concept of stockpiling Bitcoins for investment purposes is only for speculators, think again. The famed Winklevoss twins once reported they held up to one percent of the total amount of Bitcoins in circulation. With more and more methods for procuring Bitcoin being made available, there has certainly never been a better time to begin a cryptocurrency investment portfolio.\n\n2. Blockchain Penny Stocks\n\nYes, there are even penny stocks for cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin is definitely the most well-known digital currency, it is certainly not the only option. Other types of digital currency include Litecoin and Altcoins. Over the last few years, some alternative digital currencies were developed in an attempt to compete with Bitcoin, but many others were designed specifically to fill needs not met by Bitcoin. For instance, some cryptocurrencies have been developed for the purposes of enabling digital asset registry, providing increased privacy, allowing escrow services, and more. Bitcoin penny stocks like Bitcoin Shop Inc, Global Future City Holding, and American Green, Inc. offer Bitcoin penny stock investment opportunities. (For more see: Bitcoin Vs. Litecoin: What\'s the difference?)\n\n3. Altcoin Crowdfunding\n\nCrowdfunding is now considered a popular and mainstream method for raising seed capital for all types of investments. If you\'re seeking to get involved in blockchain technology, one option to consider is a unique crowdfunding method using alternative coins. With this method, total coin supply is pre-mined and then sold in an initial coin offering, or ICO, prior to the network being publicly launched. Bitshares is just one of the many well-known coin networks that used this method to get started. Services and apps using blockchain technology have also utilized this same pre-sale method to raise funding. With this method, investors are given the opportunity to purchase coins with the expectation that prices will increase at some point in the future, if the service becomes popular. (For more, see: Will Crowdfunding Save Bitcoin?)\n\n4. Angel Funding and Startup Ventures\n\nAngel funding and investing in startups is certainly not a new concept. One variation that is beginning to gain traction is the idea of investing in startups built on blockchain technology. As Bitcoin has become increasingly popular and accepted by more mainstream businesses, the number of entrepreneurs interested in experimenting with the technology behind the cryptocurrency has skyrocketed. Yet, as is the case with any other new venture, such startups need funding. Providing startup and angel funding allows you to get in on the ground floor of what could turn out to be the next Google, Apple, or blockchain frontier. Of course, it should always be understood that there are significant risks. Since the profit potential is massive, it is important to carefully weigh both the pros and the cons.\n\n5. Pure Blockchain Technology Play\n\nAn increasing number of pure blockchain technology plays is now also on the rise. Companies such as hashing Space Corporation, BTCS, Inc. and Global Arena Holding are rapidly becoming well-known names in this space. BTCS, for instance, markets itself as the first ""pure play"" U.S. public company focused on blockchain technology. The company works to secure the blockchain via its distinctive transaction verification services. Global Arena Holding is currently leveraging blockchain technology for potential in voting verification.\n\nNot sure which investment method is right for your risk appetite? If you want to keep risk low, the best option is to invest in stocks issued by one of the larger financial services companies currently experimenting with the potential of blockchain technology for improving services. For investors who are able to tolerate a higher degree of risk in exchange for a greater return, investing in one of the pure blockchain technology investment opportunities could deliver the right combination of risk versus return.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile many naysayers contended that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin were nothing more than a passing fad, six years in, they represent a concept that continues to gain steam and could even have the power to change the world. For those adventurous investors who choose to become involved in the blockchain technology boom, the payoff could be massive.', ""Litecoin\n\nLitecoin is clamped firmly between the prices $3.20 and $3.50, and can’t cross any of the two levels. This in turn is leaving traders frustrated as it’s far from ideal..\n\nThe two major forces affecting the Litecoin’s price fluctuation: the growth of Bitcoin price from $350 to $360, and the falling of LTC/BTC pair exchange rate from 0.095 to 0.092 in a single day. These forces are interconnected as because of the growth of Bitcoin’s price Litecoin miners are trying to get rid of the cryptocurrency in exchange for the growing Bitcoin. Thus, miners get more profits in fiat equivalent. Bitcoin is now in a growing trend which makes the LTC/BTC exchange rate decrease constantly.\n\nRecently Litecoin was holding strong at a psychologically important level of 0.01 (1 Bitcoin for 100 Litecoin), and now it faces a lower rate of 0.075, and potentially even 0.05. And all that because of Bitcoin. Only a noticeable weakening of Bitcoin can give the LTC/BTC pair stimulus to buck the current trend and add some price gains to the charts.\n\nDASH\n\nDASH has stabilized its position after yesterday's success, having shown us that 0.055 is the lowest level it’s going to hit and placing any buy orders lower than 0.06 promises to be favorable, even in the short term. Even this week I hope to close orders higher than 0.065 as volumes grow, and sharp falling of the price has stopped. It seems that miners don't want to get rid of DASH and gradually begin holding on to it. Today's transactions aren't similar to fixing of profit.\n\nNow we can see an upward exit from a triangle and the line of a trend.\n\nDogecoin\n\nOn this chart you can see the recent Dogecoin price levels: 38-40 Satoshi, 36-38 Satoshi, and today's 33-35 Satoshi. And this isn’t a two weeks chart! It’s a good idea to wait a few weeks more, and maybe buy coins at a cheaper price than 20 Satoshi per coin. Thus, Dogecoin is a serious cryptocurrency which waits for broader acceptance in 2016.\n\nETH\n\nETH wasn't expected to show a price growth. The huge liquidity and volatility of ETH drive it to the bottom, falling sometimes by 10% in a day. When trading such a young cryptocurrency there is no sense in following daily or weekly charts. On this monthly chart we see both opportunities for purchase around 0.013-0.014, and opportunities to close the orders at a price that is 2.5 times higher. It would be desirable if ETH repeated these movements, but this time with us onboard.\n\nPeercoin\n\nPeercoin continues to hold the boundary of $0.40 though trading volumes on BTC-E are falling and the PPC/BTC exchange rate is going down. It is unlikely that we will see the price drop below $0.40 for a long time, so any orders between the levels of $0.20 and $0.40 are quite justified.""]"

With her leadership, we look forward to telling the BitFury Blockchain story to the world.”\n\nCheck out Jamie’s op-ed published today on medium.com highlighting why she joined BitFury.\n\nJamie Smith Background:\n\nSmith most recently served as Executive Vice President at Edelman Public Relations where she oversaw multi-channel media strategies from Washington, DC. Prior to that, she served as Special Assistant and Spokesperson for President Obama and Deputy White House Press Secretary. She also previously served as Director of Public Affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Communications Director for the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and its then Chairman John D (Jay) Rockefeller IV, Traveling Press Director for Secretary Hillary Clinton’s 2008 Presidential Campaign, and Communications Director for Madeleine K. Albright and The Albright Group, LLC. Smith is from Buffalo Grove, Illinois, and a graduate of Kenyon College.\n\nAbout BitFury Group:\n\nBitFury Group is the largest private Bitcoin Blockchain infrastructure provider and transaction processing company in the world. Founded in 2011 by Valery Vavilov and Valery Nebesny, BitFury has management offices in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Hong Kong, Amsterdam and London, as well as data-centers in Iceland and the Republic of Georgia. BitFury derives sustainable advantage through its custom-made application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), optimized to achieve the lowest power consumption coupled with the highest processing metrics – the parameters that drive mining margins.

A useful feature for users is they don't need an internet connection when transacting among each other.\n\n“We launched the card product at the “CARTES SECURE CONNEXIONS” two weeks ago,” confirms Alexander Vasylchenko, CTO at Mycelium, for CoinTelegraph. It is the largest global event bringing together the key decision makers from around the world from the payments, identification and mobility ecosystem.\n\nUseful features\n\nMycelium allows completing card-to-card transactions as well as consumer-to-merchant transactions. The payment system only revolves around issuing cards to consumers and distributing hubs to merchants. As the system's record tracking and security is based on blockchain distributed ledger, the physical infrastructure is kept simple and inexpensive.\n\nThe hub transfers information between the card and the distributed ledger infrastructure and does not contain any sensitive data. A transaction is immediately forwarded to a server, which sends it to the distributed ledger right away. For this reason, data in the card do not need to be encrypted.\n\nMycelium and other payment systems\n\nAn essential difference when comparing Mycelium to other payment systems is its low operational cost. It does not require any network deployment, thus does not cause any network maintenance cost. Its operational costs are much lower than a traditional payment system where the issuer, the acquirer and multiple processors have each to get their share of the interchange fee.\n\nJack Cheng who is responsible for the media and marketing in ANX International, company that offers a full suite of Blockchain Solutions to the global market commented:\n\n“There's been too much focus on the technology aspect of Bitcoins. This has slowed the overall adoption of these technologies as merchants and business are not technologists and we have seen that things must improve and be made simpler for business and then consumers to adapt. Businesses and consumers are practical and looking for solutions that can help move their business forward or improve what they have today and not necessarily what is the latest technology.”\n\nUnlike traditional payment systems, Mycelium does not need merchants to purchase POS terminals, acquirers to set up servers, processors to build large secure data centers, or issuers to set up complex and expensive issuing processes and hardware. The company says it provides the technology aiming at connecting consumers and merchants in the most simple, familiar, reliable and convenient way.\n\nThe main show-stopper these days is the gap generated by regulation frameworks between what society can achieve technically and what it can achieve legally. „This is why the current setup still looks quite complicated compared to what it could be technically: consumers with cards, merchants with hubs and nothing in between besides the distributed ledger.“\n\nOf course, companies providing classic debit cards enabling their customers to pay with fiat money in stores do not share the same vision with Mycelium. One of those is Bit-X. Alex Schultz, it’s CEO, replied via marketing department, that he can’t give official comment, because he considers the product of Mycelium to be entirely different and can't be compared with BitX debit card. But Marco Giovanni, Head of Marketing at BitX, gave to CoinTelegraph his unofficial thoughts about Mycelium card:"", 'Goldman Sachs is bullish on the cryptocurrency technology known as the blockchain.\n\nThe New York based financial institution spotlighted blockchain—the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies—in an end-of-the-year research report about emerging technology. Blockchain is essentially a shared online public ledger that is supposedly impervious to tampering and revision.\n\nHow bitcoin works. (Goldman Sachs)\n\nGoldman’s analyst thinks the technology “has the potential to redefine transactions and the back office of a multitude of different industries.” He writes:\n\nFrom banking and payments to notaries to voting systems to vehicle registrations to wire fees to gun checks to academic records to trade settlement to cataloguing ownership of works of art, a distributed shared ledger has the potential to make interactions quicker, less-expensive and safer. By removing the need for a middle man one lowers potential security concerns from hacking to corruption as well as speeding up manual processes that are antiquated and can take too long.\n\nGoldman isn’t the only financial institution interested in blockchain. UBS opened a research lab in London to study and analyze blockchain and look for potential uses within financial services and beyond. A white paper from Santander published over the summer estimates blockchain technology could help banks save $20 billion in infrastructure costs for cross-border payments, settlements, and compliance.\n\nBut Goldman does seem to be one of the most gung-ho financial institutions when it comes to cryptocurrency. The US Patent and Trademark Office recently published an 2014 patent application in which Goldman laid out its development of its own cryptocurrency to be used in a settlement system for trading stocks, bonds and other assets. Goldman was also recently part of a $50 million investment round in Circle, a payments app that utilizes bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nGiven Goldman’s business interests in blockchain technology, one could—perhaps cynically—suggest Goldman analysts are talking their book in their recent research. On the other hand, you could also argue that the firm is putting its money where its mouth is.', 'PrivatBank, Ukraine’s largest bank by assets is now offering online retailers the ability to receive Bitcoin as a payment before directly converting it into fiat currency that is deposited into the merchant’s account, as reported by PSM7.\n\nUpon the completion of its testing, PrivatBank is now offering online retailers the means to obtain a settlement in Bitcoin. The announcement was made by Christina Karmazin, head of E-Commerce at PrivatBank at a conference in Kiev, Ukraine today.\n\nUkrainian online publication Payspace Magazine, reported the news that was revealed at the “Cross-border E-Commerce: The Import to Ukraine,” conference.\n\nEssentially, buyers can pay in Bitcoin while merchants will receive the payment in Hryvnias (Ukraine’s national currency) or Euros.\n\nElaborating on the new feature, Karmazin stated:\n\nWe have already completed the testing service and traders are now looking for partners who are willing to integrate [receiving] Bitcoins in their checkout page. [Also], we [are focusing] not only within the Ukrainian market but also the European market.\n\nThe check-out process is one similar to most online shoppers. Buyers can choose Bitcoin as the payment method when arriving at the checkout page. Upon scanning the QR-Code, the bitcoin transaction is initiated. To round up the process, PrivatBank will guage the current exchange rate in Hryvnias or Euros – depending on the specified currency – before converting the cryptocurrency to fiat money.\n\nAlso read: Turmoil in Ukraine Shows Bitcoin’s Potential as a Global Currency\n\nChristina was also asked about the controversy surrounding Bitcoin- and cryptocurrency-regulation in the country. She confirmed PrivatBank has filed an application with the National Bank of Ukraine.\n\nBitcoin is slowly being adopted within Ukraine and CCN recently investigated a report of widespread installations of ATMs in the country.

The former CFO, who earned $240,000 in the position, is seeking a jury trial to obtain damages of up to $10,000 and attorney’s fees as a result of the alleged breach of contract and violations to California Labor Code.\n\nThe filing reads:\n\n”Throughout his employment with defendants, plaintiff demanded defendants comply with the Employment Contract and make the required grant of equity to the plaintiff. Defendants terminated plaintiff’s employment in retaliation therefore in order to avoid their obligations to plaintiff under the Employment contract.”\n\nDuring his time, Golomb served on BitFury’s board of directors and was head of its San Francisco office, according to court documents.\n\nBitFury has since moved to demur the lawsuit through a series of filings by its law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP dating back to June.\n\n""As a company, we intend to fight this case vigorously. We think it without merit,"" BitFury legal counsel Varun Gupta told CoinDesk.\n\nSince June, BitFury has also moved to strike portions of the complaint and push for discovery to be limited due to the fact it could lead to “confidential, proprietary or private information” being disclosed. In addition, it has argued that certain stipulations, such as the disclosure of all company communications with Golomb present an undue burden.\n\nGolomb\'s statement\n\nIn a new statement, Golomb has offered new comments on the lawsuit, maintaining that he was fired under ""false pretenses"".\n\n""I accepted employment and worked tirelessly to grow the company in part because I believed BitFury\'s CEO, Valery Vavilov, would live up to his end of the bargain,"" Golomb said. ""Unfortunately, it turns out that my belief was misplaced. Because Valery and BitFury reneged on its promise to give me equity, I was forced to bring a lawsuit to vindicate my rights.""\n\nGolomb further called allegations that he was abusive to colleagues ""outrageous"", contending that he displayed ""flawless conduct"" during his tenure.\n\n""These allegations amount to nothing more than ill-advised litigation tactics coming from a desperate company,"" he said.\n\nCompounding the situation, Golomb said, is that BitFury has since grown to become a leader in the bitcoin space, a position he argues he helped the company achieve.\n\nGolomb added:\n\n""When I joined the BitFury in early 2014, it was just another brand new startup in Ukraine and in the crowded bitcoin space that wanted to become an internationally recognized leader.""\n\nThe next hearing in the case is scheduled for 9:30am on 30th December.\n\nBusinessman with contract image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

BTCC plays a leading role in every segment of the Bitcoin ecosystem, offering digital currency exchange, mining pool, payment processing, consumer wallets, and blockchain engraving. The diverse products and services BTCC offers allow its customers to engage in all aspects of the digital currency spectrum in one integrated platform.\n\nHeadquartered in Shanghai, BTCC serves a global customer base and has become an industry leader for security, risk mitigation, credibility, and technological innovation. BTCC’s mission is to provide the world with the most convenient and trustworthy digital currency services.\n\nBTCC founder Bobby Lee and his brother, litecoin creator Charlie Lee, are, by all reckoning, among the writers of Bitcoin’s history. As such, they have extensive knowledge in the field of cryptocurrency.\n\nBobby and Charlie Lee, brothers were born in the Ivory Coast and grew up in the US to parents from Shanghai and were among the first Chinese people to go to Africa in the 1960s. After growing up in Africa, they went to the US for their studies, and after college, they both found jobs working for major IT companies: Charlie worked for Google and Bobby for Yahoo.\n\nBobby is co-founder and CEO of BTCC, and serves on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, the most important non-profit organization that works to promote the adoption of bitcoin globally.\n\nWe talked with him about BTCC and the future of Bitcoin.\n\nCT: So much water (money) flowed under the bridge since you founded BTC China in 2011. Back then trust in Bitcoin was incomparably lower than now. How much were you confident on the success of Bitcoin when you opened BTC China?\n\nBobby Lee: When I started BTCC, Bitcoin was practically unknown in China. Only a very small circle of enthusiasts actually knew about Bitcoin, early miners trading it with early adopters. Back in early 2013, in private gatherings with friends, as well as at public events I attend, I would always ask if anyone has heard of Bitcoin, and there would be a long silence, and it was clear no one has ever heard of this Bitcoin thing. Despite the lack of awareness, I was confident in it. I knew it was a matter of time for people to embrace Bitcoin, first by learning more about it, and then eventually believing in it and trusting it.\n\nCT: Does BTCC own any mining hardware?\n\nBL: BTCC does not run any mining rigs, so we are not a bitcoin mining operation. Instead, BTCC operates a mining pool, which is a loose collection of actual bitcoin miners (who own and run the hardware) getting together to pool their resources, and mine together, and share risk and reward. The miners forming BTCC Pool have their hardware distributed all over the world, but right now, the concentration is primarily in China.\n\nCT: Do you plan to expand the mining capacity of the company, or hold for now?\n\nBL: We are always encouraging more miners to come use our mining pool service, as we provide the most reliable mining pool platform, with the highest payouts in the industry, in a riskless fashion because we pay per share, regardless of luck. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors as we are extremely transparent about our hash rates and fees structure, ensuring that our customers will get the most bitcoins from their hashing power, regardless of how much or how little hashing power they have. Please come give BTCC Pool a try!\n\nCT: What do you think will happen to Bitcoin price when the mining reward will be halved from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC per block? And what will happen to miners? Do you think this will cut miners’ profits? Will we see a sudden drop in the number of nodes on the network?\n\nBL: For me, it will be very exciting when the block reward halving happens next year. It marks another important milestone in Bitcoin’s early adoption by the world, as it will only be the second time the block reward halves. When that happens, and even leading up to it, many people think bitcoin price will shoot up, in anticipation of the slowing down of issuance of Bitcoin. I tend to agree with this, as this would even further remind people and reinforce the idea that Bitcoin supply is truly limited to 21 million. For miners, the lowering of rewards could potentially mean lower income if the price increase does not adequately compensate. This means that some miners would find it no longer profitable to run certain hardware, and will decide to turn off the machines. So overall network hashrate could see a temporary decrease, but it should not affect the number of full nodes on the bitcoin network.\n\nCT: How quickly is mining hardware becoming old? What happens to the old mining hardware?\n\nBL: This is hard to say. Old mining hardware becomes uneconomical to be kept running if the electricity costs exceeds the return in Bitcoins. Usually, the hardware gets scrapped, but many times, it gets sold in the marketplace, to someone else who can run it at locations with cheaper, or even free, electricity. With free electricity, mining hardware can be run indefinitely, so the resource bottleneck becomes real estate, operational overhead, and the amount of free electricity itself.\n\nCT: Bitcoin’s biggest point is decentralization, but under a different point of view it’s also a weakness. In fact, exactly because it’s nobody’s property, nobody spends money to advertise it, and this is one of the reasons why so many people still don’t know about it. True, there’s word of mouth, but it doesn’t achieve as much as a well orchestrated professional marketing campaign, and true, some small company made some investment and pushed Bitcoin adoption with good results, but these are small, local things. It could be done on a much larger scale. But for a larger scale, a larger investment is required. Don’t you think that large companies working in the sector, like yours, should work together to create a marketing campaign? After all, you can be identified as the ones with the biggest interest in an increase of the Bitcoin value, at the moment.\n\nBL: Bitcoin is public, in the sense that it belongs to the people; a gift from Satoshi Nakamoto. We all have an individual choice whether or not to use bitcoin. Bitcoin is great because it is decentralized, and not controlled or marketed by any single company. That is truly a breath of fresh air, just like how the Internet was. For the Internet, many individuals and companies found it valuable, and built businesses and new business models around it, and benefited from it. For Bitcoin, it’s the same. Bitcoin companies are already pushing and promoting it, encouraging users and merchants to adopt it, and I am sure more of this will happen from all Bitcoin companies. Bitcoin Foundation is also very involved in promoting and advocating for Bitcoin globally. In the end, I don’t think we will see much of any generic advertising campaigns for bitcoin. Here is why: the success and worldwide adoption of the Internet did not come from any “Please use the Internet” or “The Internet is great” advertising campaigns. The Internet became successful on its own merits, with a lot of Internet companies providing tremendous value to users.\n\nThe same will happen with Bitcoin.', 'Most people who have heard the term think that the “blockchain” is only something to do with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, litecoin, doguecoin and others. It’s the technology that underpins digital currencies and ensures that all transactions are properly conducted and recorded. But what is stored on the blockchain need not be just a currency unit – it can be put to all manner of other interesting uses.\n\nThe blockchain is defined as “a system that’s secure without a higher authority, distributed across many strangers’ computers, yet tamper-proof, and promises a mechanism for trust mediated directly between individuals”. Essentially, by providing a distributed means to guarantee and verify transactions, the blockchain offers the ultimate opportunity to cut out the middleman.\n\nA key aspect is the programmable smart contract: code stored on the blockchain that automatically executes when certain conditions have been met. In uses that involve a financial transaction, it makes sense to use bitcoin or some other digital currency for the same reason – by doing so, transactions can be automated and guaranteed without recourse to third parties, such as a bank.\n\nNot all uses involve payments. For example, Kim Jackson and Zach LeBeau were married on the blockchain in November. Is a blockchain marriage legally binding? Well, some parts of it would fall within contract law, but it’s a first symbolic step.\n\nMany major companies are looking to the blockchain as a way to simplify and strengthen supply chains, where the blockchain could record each step a product has taken. For example, it could be used to guarantee the origin of foods.\n\nIn other cases, the blockchain can be used for peer-to-peer exchange or sale. Imagine you have an electric car. When your charger is unused, you can rent it out to other car owners, paid in bitcoins via a blockchain smart contract.\n\nAnother use is automated security, using code embedded on the blockchain to trigger granting or denying access depending on the requester. This way security is assured, as no third parties are involve and no one holds the “keys”: the lock has become one with the key, and assurance lies in the distributed trust of a shared, anonymous network.\n\nOne firm supplying this is Slock. The owner can set a deposit amount and a price for renting a property, which the user pays through a blockchain transaction (not even Slock is a middleman), which permits the user to open and close the smart lock through their smartphone. It’s a lock activated by money, without any need for third-party authority. And it’s not just start-ups such as Slock that are taking notice – bigger players, including IBM, are onto it too.\n\nDecentralising everything\n\nA radically different application comes from Bitnation, a project aimed at using blockchain to decentralise governance. Bitnation is offering victims of the refugee crisis an emergency digital ID and bitcoin-based credit card which can be used to receive funds from family members or friends without bank accounts.\n\nWith this it is possible for an individual to prove their existence and identity through family relations cryptographically, recorded on the blockchain like a distributed public ledger. This acts as a sort of international notary public. Bitnation works by generating a QR code – a barcode – which can be used with a cellphone to apply for a bitcoin credit card which can be used throughout Europe and the UK without a bank account.\n\nariadna de raadt/shutterstock.com\n\nBlockchain automation\n\nAustralian software firm Edgelogic offers a glimpse of how blockchain technology could be used at home, a bridge between digital payments and the Internet of Things. For example, a sensor could report to the blockchain when it detects damp, an alert which triggers a set of instructions that transfers cash for repairs from an insurer to a claimant’s account, even before the person knows anything is wrong.\n\nA digital crypto-currency has just launched that is generated by human movement. Bitwalking dollars can be earned simply by walking, unlike other digital currencies such as bitcoins that require “mining” though using computers to solve cryptographic problems. With Bitwalking, a phone app counts and verifies users’ steps and walkers earning approximately BW$1 for every 10,000 steps (about five miles). These can be spent in an online store, or traded for cash.\n\nWhile some ideas may seem like solutions looking for a problem, others are more closely tied to real needs. They redefine what use the blockchain could be put to – eliminating the need for banks, or even for aspects of government. It’s clear that the blockchain has expanded beyond bitcoin and cryptocurrencies – but as with all disruptive technologies, in which direction it will be taken remains to be seen.', 'US, December 4, 2015 at 17:01 UTC\n\nAustin, Texas – Bitjoy, the world’s first bitcoin-based user engagement and in-app purchase platform for mobile app developers, enters public beta this month. With support for iOS, Android and Unity, Bitjoy empowers thousands of mobile app developers with the ability to accept bitcoin for in-app purchases and reward bitcoin to users completing engagements within their apps.\n\nLynn Duke, founder of Bitjoy says, “…as 7-year veteran app developers ourselves, we saw a giant gap between Apple and Google tools compared to what’s available in the bitcoin space for in-app purchase and engagements. We believe bitcoin will create entirely new business models for app ecosystems.”\n\nThe platform is running on several apps in the Google Play Store and has been in private beta since September. During that time, over 2 million in-app engagements have been paid out to users.\n\n“As a developer, imagine being able to withdraw your in-app sales in a mere 10 minutes instead of net-30, or imagine saying goodbye to the 30% commission app stores typically charge. Bitjoy enables bidirectional transfer of bitcoin between developers and their users – limited only by the developer’s imagination,” Lynn continues.\n\nInterested developers can sign up at www.bitjoy.io for a free account and to be notified when the SDKs are available for download later this month. Additional features expected to come online in Q1 2016 include player-to-player tipping and global app “pots”.\n\nhttp://www.bitjoy.io\n\nThe publication of a press release on this page should not be viewed as an endorsement by CoinDesk.

He is extremely interested in the idea of using the Bitcoin blockchain to increase overall efficiency in the real estate industry, and he’ll be discussing this topic at the upcoming Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego.\n\n[Read More: Mycelium’s Dmitry Murashchik: All Assets and Identities on the Blockchain Within 10 Years]\n\nLifthrasir recently shared some of his thoughts on Bitcoin’s future role in real estate with Inside Bitcoins. In short, he believes that the blockchain will offer many improvements over traditional options for record keeping in the real estate industry.\n\nThe Blockchain Can Save the Real Estate Industry Significant Amounts of Money\n\nWhen discussing the advantages of the Bitcoin blockchain for property title management, Ragnar Lifthrasir was quick to point out the current costs associated with title insurance and title fraud:\n\n“Putting property titles on the Bitcoin blockchain will bring the real estate industry out of its existing 18th century technology. Title insurance is a $20 billion industry. It’s estimated that the total annual cost of fighting and resolving title fraud is $1 billion.”\n\nLifthrasir also noted how easy it is for a criminal to create fake documents that can cause serious issues for homeowners. In his view, the Bitcoin blockchain can offer an improved system for tracking property ownership records. He explained:\n\n“Using Photoshop and a $15 stamp, a criminal can create a fake document that transfers ownership of your house to himself. Compare that to what it would take for that criminal to break the cryptography behind Bitcoin. I can’t predict exactly how much time and money would be saved by using the Bitcoin Blockchain for real estate titles, but clearly, it’s significant.”\n\nLifthrasir is a big believer in the idea of smart property, and he’s currently working with a group of individuals from the International Bitcoin Real Estate Association on an application that will streamline the entire property transfer process. He noted:\n\n“I want to also say that uploading a deed to the blockchain is only half the solution. For full security, the actual transfer of real estate needs to be done with the Bitcoin token. By that I mean a colored coin solution similar to the one NASDAQ and Overstock are using. A couple of us at the International Bitcoin Real Estate Association are currently working on a combination title document plus property transfer app.”\n\n[Read More: No Need to Wait for Overstock or NASDAQ, Veritaseum Already Put Wall Street on the Bitcoin Blockchain]\n\nDon’t Waste Time Selling Blockchain Technology to Governments\n\nMost people think about government records when it comes to titles to houses, cars, and other forms of property, and it would appear that Bitcoin could offer serious improvements over the current system. Having said that, Ragnar Lifthrasir does not believe people should waste their time teaching governments about the blockchain. He noted:\n\n“It’d be great if the government used the Bitcoin blockchain to track property. But I don’t think it’s worth much time or effort to convince them to do it. Real estate companies and investors don’t need the government to transact amongst themselves. The clerk’s office at the county is just a central place to keep photocopies. There’s nothing magical about it.“\n\nLifthrasir added that the Bitcoin blockchain allows the real estate industry to avoid the inefficiencies associated with the current government record keeping structure:\n\n“But now we have Bitcoin. At its most basic, Bitcoin is a better way for disparate parties to achieve consensus about who owns an asset, especially when one party is trying to cheat another, as happens in property titles. So, as long as people in the real estate industry start deciding to use the Bitcoin blockchain to record the transfer of properties, why bother with the delay, cost, and inefficiency of the government?”\n\n[Read More: Nakamoto Institute’s Krawisz: Bitcoin Does Well When Governments Act Stupidly]\n\nThe Blockchain is Superior to Government Record Keeping\n\nMany bitcoin enthusiasts find the digital commodity to be an improvement over the current fiat currency system, but the Bitcoin blockchain can be used for much more than just money. Lifthrasir described the International Bitcoin Real Estate Association’s intention to bring together professionals from the industry who would like to move various aspects of the business onto the blockchain:\n\n“Just as bitcoin the currency offers a superior alternative to government currency, Bitcoin the blockchain offers a superior alternative to government record keeping. One of our main efforts at The International Bitcoin Real Estate Association is to connect real estate professionals who want to use Bitcoin for purchasing, escrowing, and recording the transfer of properties.”\n\nAlthough many people still believe Bitcoin has not completely proved itself, Lifthrasir believes that the technology is now mature enough to be used in the real estate industry. Due to his involvement in both real estate and blockchain technology, Lifthrasir is convinced that 2016 will be the year that property title management moves onto the blockchain. He noted:\n\n“Bitcoin is finally technologically mature enough to be used in real estate. Now what we need are more startups to produce good industry products and services. I think 2016 will be the year of Bitcoin real estate.”\n\nIf you’d like to hear more of Ragnar Lifthrasir’s thoughts on bringing the real estate industry to Bitcoin, make sure to attend the upcoming Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Visa Europe\'s innovation lab was demonstrating its proof-of-concept remittance app, which sends funds over the bitcoin blockchain, at the UnBound London conference on 30th November.\n\nThe lab built the prototype with startup Epiphyte as part of a 100-day development project. Visa Europe Collab\'s Jon Downing and Epiphyte\'s Edan Yago discussed the reasons for embarking on the project, and for using the bitcoin blockchain instead of a closed network, in this CoinDesk exclusive.\n\nAt the conference, held under the Victorian railway arches of London Bridge, Collab\'s Nigel Clarke, an innovation partner there, gave us a hands-on demo of the money-transfer prototype with an exclusive screen-by-screen walkthrough.\n\nRemittance journey\n\nThe ""remittance journey"" starts on the send screen. This is a responsive web page that works on a desktop or mobile browser. The idea is for a user to link a Visa card to the remittance app. Once linked, the app will show an available balance and the corresponding card details.\n\nThe prototype comes with BitPesa built in as a third-party service that will enable the recipient to obtain their funds in a fiat currency of their choice. The user therefore has to sign up for a BitPesa or other third-party service account before sending funds, including performing any \'know your customer\' procedures like uploading identity documents.\n\nOnce signed up, the user can then add a list of recipients using a variety of contact information. For example, Clarke said, a user could add a Kenyan telephone number to the recipient list.\n\n""When I want to send funds to grandma, I put in her mobile phone number in Kenya,"" he said.\n\nOnce added, BitPesa generates a bitcoin address for the recipient, meaning the recipient never has to generate an address or wallet of their own to receive the funds. The sender can also include a note with the money transfer.\n\nThe recipient doesn\'t need a BitPesa account to obtain the funds. Instead, they would simply receive Kenyan shillings transferred by M-Pesa, the dominant mobile money channel there.\n\nThe app, then, has allowed \'John\' to send 25 pounds from a Visa card to his grandma in Kenya, who received Kenyan shillings on her phone, with the whole process taking about six steps.\n\nIn between, the funds were taken from the Visa-linked account, converted to bitcoin and sent to an address generated by BitPesa, then converted into Kenyan shilling and transferred to the receiver\'s M-Pesa account.\n\nBack-end\n\nThe app\'s operator also gets a snazzy looking back-end to check on the status of fund transfers. Clarke walked us through the console.\n\nA status bar at the top of the console visualises the remittance journey. For the purposes of the prototype, Clarke said, the plumbing connecting the app and the Visa card and its issuing bank wasn\'t built out. Instead, the prototype assumes the funds are there and the issuer will approve their transfer.\n\nOnce the funds are approved by the bank, the amount has to be converted by the third-party vendor, in this case BitPesa, into bitcoin. After that, the bitcoins have to be temporarily deposited into a wallet, also created by the vendor.\n\nThe proof-of-concept runs on bitcoin\'s Testnet – not the live blockchain. When a transaction is confirmed on the Testnet, the payment is marked as transferred and the transaction confirmed in the back-end.\n\nClarke punched in the transaction ID from our demo into Blocktrail\'s Testnet explorer. Initially, it showed that the transaction had not been confirmed yet, even though the console showed it had gone through. After several minutes, however, the transaction was confirmed on the Testnet.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe next stage of development for Visa Europe\'s bitcoin remittance concept is user research. According to Clarke and Downing, the last few days have been spent on research groups with users who regularly remit money, asking them questions about their comfort level with using bitcoin for remittances, for example.\n\nDowning said users have been surprisingly curious about the use of bitcoin and its underlying technology. Initial responses from users suggest that they are neutral and sometimes positive about bitcoin\'s potential as a remittance technology, with little indication that they are fearful or cautious about using it, according to Downing.\n\nIn future, Clarke said, the remittance concept could be integrated with other third-party vendors, taking care of the ""off-ramp"" problem for users to receive their funds.\n\nThe app could ultimately be deployed in a number of different ways, including as a ""white label"" service to banks, Downing said.\n\nBut for now, the concept is drawing to the end of its 100-day development cycle. Clarke said the user research would inform the team\'s next steps, which would be to consider a commercial model for the product. This would include a possible fee structure and consideration of third-party vendors.\n\nDowning stressed that there is no guarantee that the concept would be used in a commercial setting. Those decisions lie further down the road, he said.\n\n""We wanted to test the technology\'s capabilities ... but we haven\'t made any of those decisions,"" he said.\n\nImage credit: Valeri Potapova / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It will help save billions of dollars of fees to brokers and trading agents and bring the money to the development of businesses.\n\nCT: Tell our readers about your new apps. How exactly will they work?\n\nCH: Right now there\'s three apps planned for release:\n\nCORE: It’s our open source miner, which will allow people to set up their own Equibit node and mine for Equibits. Miners are rewarded with new Equibits, as well as transaction fees that may contain actual company stocks as well. It would be an easy way for someone to passively build up a portfolio of investments. CORE will include a command line interface and API. We\'re aiming to produce a solid backend solution that can be integrated just about anywhere, including in to existing financial applications the industry is currently using.\n\nINVESTOR: This will be a web-based wallet (we\'re calling them ""portfolios"") app that will allow users to transact in Bitcoins, Equibits, and Bitmessage. Investors have access to all the information on the network, making it incredibly easy to locate companies, buy and sell, all without the need for transfer agents or other OTC market information agencies. INVESTOR will have a research and analysis tool, similar to Yahoo or Google finance, where they can look up for companies and locate willing sellers. Buying/selling equibits is as easy as trading bitcoins, and the UI will be very similar to the trading screens you get through any online brokerage. Although we\'re adding the option for people to use a smart contract that ensures both participants get what they bargained for.\n\nISSUER: If a company wants to raise capital, this app will allow them to create equity units out of their Equibits, distribute notices and other messages to their shareholders, poll them, and easily distribute earnings via Bitcoin transfers. ISSUER will contain workflows for companies to create classes of equity, communicate with and poll the holders of their equity, and distribute bitcoins to them very easily.\n\nINVESTOR & ISSUER are targeted towards the end user and will each have their own interface and workflows.\n\nOverall, we\'re focused on making the user experience as familiar and simple as possible to current OTC market participants.\n\nCT: Will your users be able to interact with traditional OTC markets?\n\nCH: By integrating CORE into existing systems it would open up that possibility. However there are obvious incentives for current OTC issuers to convert over to Equibit so we see that as being the more likely course of action.\n\nCT: What are the incentives exactly?\n\nCH: Equibit makes the whole process of investor relations much quicker and cost-effective.\n\nCreating a new issuance is far less expensive as issuers simply need to first obtain some Equibits.\n\nOnce created, these equity representations are unforgeable and this is currently quite a serious problem in the current OTC market.\n\nIssuers never need to go through the process of splitting their shares, or issuing a share-based dividend to increase the liquidity of their stock.\n\nThe costs of distributing shareholder notices, MD&A\'s and other messages, conducting polls, and distributing dividends all drop to practically zero.\n\nWilling sellers in the secondary market can make their shares \'discoverable\' by other Equibit users, and buyers have access to all the trading history of a company thus making it unnecessary to pay for a service such as Pink Sheets (aka OTC Markets Group) for the latest trade information.\n\nThere\'s more, but these are really key value adds that our system brings to issuers.\n\nCT: You’ve previously said in one of the interviews the opportunities will be available to North American angel investors. Are your products limited only to this geographical area? Can investors from other regions benefit from your new platform?\n\nCH: The way we structured the offering has changed slightly since then and is now open to US, Canadian, and International investors. They can purchase preferred shares in EDC (""Equibit Development Corporation"") that are redeemable for equibit units once the network goes up.\n\nCT: Have you already managed to attract some well-known investors to your project?\n\nCH: We\'ve been approached by several Silicon Valley venture capitalists as well as asset managers at this point.\n\nThe launch of the platform is expected early next year.', 'From learning how to cook homemade meals to guzzling daily kale-salmon smoothies, any good, new habits require a fair amount of energy and time. But if they don\'t connect with what you believe in, then you\'ll fail to create the habits that matter, plain and simple.\n\nImage by GotCredit.\n\nYour values, your priorities, are the things that you truly believe deep-down are important to your life. These values certainly aren\'t confined to your health -- they can involve family, career, money, fame, skill development, or all of the above. What you value can essentially predict whether you\'ll really put in your full effort; or feel stressed out, anxious, or just disinterested while trying to create healthy habits.\n\nAnd that, quite frankly, is the difference between success in building good, healthy habits; or falling flat on your face while trying. This concept comes from Bryan Krahn, a fitness personal coach, who says:\n\nIf someone just doesn\'t see the value in improving their health or losing fat -- say they\'re ""told"" by their doctor to lose weight -- not only will they fight the big changes, they will also fight the little things.\n\nThey say that habits take smaller, manageable steps, but if you don\'t value whatever it is you are supposed to be doing, even doing the small things will suck. Rather than asking yourself ""What\'s the best way to...?"" and trying to do things that you think you ""should"" do, start asking ""What really matters to me?"" and figure out whether your priorities, behaviours and how you invest your time all align with your values.\n\nWhy Healthy Habits Don\'t Work [Bryan Krahn]', 'Argentina es uno de los países de mayor adopción Bitcoin en América Latina.

Homero Joshua Garza operated two Bitcoin companies, GAW Miners and ZenMiner. The Connecticut-based scam paid early investors with the funds of later participants. The mining operation, according to the SEC, did not have sufficient computing power to generate the promised results.\n\nGarza’s criminal activity has been littered across the internet for many months. There is an interesting post from an individual stating Garza attempted to hire him in February 2014. Redditers posted a PSA on Garza earlier this year. Garza apparently lived the high-life off of other people’s naivete, posting pictures of Ferraris and private jets and more. Garza’s brother, Carlos Garza, was sued by the SEC this past August.\n\nThe SEC explains that from August 2014 to December 2014, Garza sold $20 million worth of purported shares in a digital mining contract they called a Hashlet. Over 10,000 investors fell for the fraud. GAW Miners directed little or no computing power toward any mining activity.\n\n“As alleged in our complaint, Garza and his companies cloaked their scheme in technological sophistication and jargon, but the fraud was simple at its core: they sold what they did not own, misrepresented what they were selling, and robbed one investor to pay another,” said Paul G. Levenson, Director of the SEC’s Boston Regional Office.\n\nThe SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief as well as the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and penalties.', 'There are many hazards in the wastelands of Fallout 4, but one Bitcoin-loving gamer found out the hard way that real life can be dangerous too. On the Bitcoin subreddit, user arkanoah was asking for help determining how his Bitcoins were stolen. It turns out a pirated game is probably the culprit.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that is held in wallet files. All Bitcoin transactions are processed in the blockchain, a sort of public master ledger of Bitcoin usage. Arkanoah posted a link to the mysterious transaction on the blockchain, showing a 4.88 BTC withdrawal from his wallet on November 11th. Guess what else happened around then. Yep, Fallout 4 was released.\n\nSomeone asked if perhaps the OP had pirated Fallout 4, and he confirmed that he had. While downloading pirated software is never entirely safe, Fallout 4 releases in particular appear to be crawling with novel malware. The most likely scenario is that an attacker gained access to arkanoah’s machine and copied his Bitcoin wallet file. The password was cracked, and the thief was able to transfer all the coins away.\n\nBecause the blockchain is public, you can see where the coins were transferred. After they hit another wallet, they were split up, mixed with more coins, and are now impossible to trace. See, in addition to being public, the blockchain is anonymous. There’s no insurance here — if you manage your own wallet, you’re responsible if it’s compromised. Based on the current value, those 4.88 coins were worth about $1,773. Ouch. Buying Fallout 4 would have been a hell of a lot cheaper. That’s an expensive lesson learned.\n\nCheck out the above if you want to exploit the economy in Fallout 4 rather than in real life.', 'If the goal of the second Scaling Bitcoin conference was to highlight an “emerging consensus” on the challenges facing the bitcoin network, the day’s panels served mostly to highlight the sometimes extreme differences in opinion that remain between key stakeholders in the technology’s open-source community.\n\nHeld in Hong Kong’s Cyberport district, day one of Scaling Bitcoin found speakers debating more freely the variety of proposals for how transaction processing on the bitcoin network should be increased, with presenters often weighing on their preferred path forward.\n\nGiven the venue of the event, however, the cultural divide underlining the debate was perhaps most on display, as panels found bitcoin’s largely Western development community and largely China-based mining industry making awkward steps toward opening up a dialogue.\n\nA much-anticipated mining panel, including typically media-shy China-based companies such as Avalon, Bitmain, BTCC, BW and F2Pool, for instance, took place after a series of technical discussions in which the term ""China"" was often used as placeholder when describing how participants in the transaction processing process might undermine network security.\n\nWhether this nuance was successfully translated was less clear, though members of China’s mining sector made it a point to state that they hope dialogue between parties improves.\n\nOverall, the mining community largely agreed that they would like to see consensus on how best to scale the network emerge soon, but they feel that decisions should be made by the community in a method informed by research, and not the will of any one group.\n\nBitmain’s Pan Zhibiao said:\n\n“There are many technical solutions. Every solution has pros and cons. The miners are put on a pedestal to be a jury. Right now there is no lawyer on both side. We need a lawyer, we need more discussion, more evidence. ”\n\nWhile the conversation succeeded in allowing each side to express a willingness to come together to find solutions, more granular or niche issues suffered due to the language gap.\n\nQuestions aimed at allowing the mining community to voice their opinion on scalability proposals that do not increase the block size received only sporadic and largely short answers.\n\nElsewhere, the day’s sessions spanned from topics such as the nature of how consensus is established on the network to showcasing results from tests of existing blocksize proposals.\n\nMiners weigh in\n\nGiven the lack of public dialogue on the subject by its participants, the mining panel, moderated by Mikael Wang of bitcoin mining and exchange provider BTCC, was perhaps most direct in its assessment of existing scaling proposals.\n\nThere, BW’s Robin Yao; F2Pool’s Wang Chun; FinalHash’s Marshall Long; Bitmain’s Pan Zhibiao; Avalon’s Liu Xiang Fu; KnCMiner’s Sam Cole and BitFury’s Alex Petrov; answered questions on the most widely cited proposals for scaling the bitcoin network, with most of the emphasis falling on BIP 100, which proposes allowing miners to decide on block sizes, and BIP 101, which lays out a timeline for how bitcoin could scale thorough 2036.\n\nNotably, miners such as KnCMiner’s Sam Cole and FinalHash’s Long indicated that they would like to see solutions that combine elements of both proposals in a sign neither has achieved a critical mass of industry consensus. Still, there was hope this could change.\n\n“We’re getting close to something everyone can agree on, that doesn’t put us in a voting power position, and something that doesn’t scale too quickly,” Long said.\n\nOther mining groups were more direct in their support for specific proposals, with Bitmain’s Zhibiao and BTCC’s Wang echoing their companies\' support for BIP 100.\n\nThe panelists also got to fire back on common assumptions made in the community about their behaviors, stressing that competition in mining would mean that, under certain proposals, the amount of voting power they had in the network would always be variable.\n\nThey also fought against the idea that all mining businesses are equal – noting the differences between centralized industrial mining operations like KnCMiner and BitFury and mining pools that unite many smaller users like BW.com and F2Pool – as well as the idea that these entities would collude along national lines to attack the network\n\n“Before 2014, over half of the hashing power was in the US. But there was no worry about US committing a 51% attack,” F2Pool’s Wang said.\n\nMiners also revealed they are not particularly enthusiastic about the voting rights BIP 100 would award them, as the panelists largely indicated that they are willing to let the network’s developers make consensus decisions provided they don’t hurt their business operations.\n\n“The core developers understand the network the best, they should be the ones who come up with a solution,” Zhibiao said. “The core developers shouldn’t have all the discussions and debate and then ask us to vote.”\n\nAdversarial thinking\n\nAnother pervasive theme of the day was the idea that solutions for scaling the bitcoin network should factor for how individual stakeholders are capable of acting in their own self-interest, and that this possibility should govern architecture.\n\nBlockstream’s Andrew Poelstra was the first to introduce the idea he termed “adversarial thinking”, noting that bitcoin is designed to operate without acknowledging how outside factors such as legal contracts or neighborly benevolence could influence certain actors.\n\n“A lot of society is about limiting adversarial behavior,” Poelstra said. “Online things are anonymous, pseudonymous and difficult to trace. If it’s possible to hurt the system, someone will do it. We can’t assume they’ll be caught.”\n\nIn his remarks, Poelstra discussed how, under these conditions, even variables that are statistically unlikely need to be considered seriously given that it is expected that the systems in place today will be built on in the future.\n\n“When we move from traditional cryptographic assumptions to more nebulous region of incentives, economics and trust ... you assume people know each other or won’t try to screw each other. This is not the world bitcoin lives in,” he continued.\n\nThe remarks were continued by developer Peter Todd who talked about the perception of the technology among major banks, which he suggested see the inability to rewind potentially fraudulent transactions as a liability.\n\nThe mix of hypotheticals may not have translated well to the international community, as Todd fielded a tough question from a prominent representative of China’s mining sector who argued that none of these participants want to “destroy the system”.\n\nTodd maintained, however, that such sentiments can’t be factored into network design.\n\n""We need to design a system where, if that very friendly, very helpful mining community doesn’t exist for some reason … the system is resilient,"" he said, adding:\n\n""We have a community of people that behave more altruistically, but we can’t rely on this assumption.""\n\nPrivacy and its relation to security was a larger focus during the day’s earlier talks, including panels by Blockstream president and Hashcash inventor Adam Back and MIT’s Madars Virza, which focused on Confidential Transactions and zero-knowledge proofs, respectively.\n\nGreat Firewall of China\n\nAlso discussed were scaling issues inherent in the design of the bitcoin mining network, which became another conversation to divide along national lines.\n\nOften evoked was the “Great Firewall of China”, a term used to denote China’s restrictive Internet policies and how they cause communication issues across the distributed bitcoin network.\n\nIn his talk, Todd presented this issue as one where self-interested parties on the network could use gaps in information access to their advantage, though its notable that both sides agreed that latency in this messaging system is an issue.\n\n“I personally think that the blocksize topic has conflicts with the Firewall of China,” Zhibiao said. “I think the current BIP 100 proposal would be good, but we need a better solution for the Great Firewall of China.”\n\nData was also given to support the notion that this issue could affect block size proposals, with developer Jonathan Toomim presenting research on how BIP 101 would be affected.\n\nShould the block size increase to 8MB, Toomim’s data suggests nodes based in China would struggle to relay transaction data.\n\n“Most of the rest of the world can handle large blocks,” Toomim said. “China, though, cannot. We need to get Chinese pools to take their block transactions outside of China.”\n\nToomim argued that this issue can be alleviated should the community optimize the block verification protocol, but he maintained that having 65% of the total hashrate based in the region was a “problem”.\n\n“The purpose [of The Great Firewall] is to censor and control information, and that has some problems for bitcoin. It makes me uncomfortable to have so much hashing power subject to that system,” he said.\n\nFinalHash’s long, however, noted that this was a matter of perspective, as if the majority of nodes were based inside China, the situation could be viewed differently.\n\nScope and goal\n\nThough the conversation often veered toward specificity, many presenters sought to stress that all members of the bitcoin community are working toward common goals.\n\nPoelstra encouraged the community to think big with its ideas, noting that, to compete with payment systems such as Visa, the amount of transactions the network can handle needs to expand by “orders of magnitude”.\n\nElsewhere, Todd advocated for smaller, more immediate steps that seek to alleviate the concerns of the startup community, but push back major decisions about network design until testing can be done to avoid outcomes commonly believed to be negative.\n\n“I don’t have a good way of scaling immediately without taking risks I don’t think are acceptable,” he said. ""My proposal is we wait and see. We should not make hasty steps to push bitcoin into a new trust model.""\n\nTodd suggested the community pursue a small block size increase, while voicing his belief that payment channels enabled by the Lightning network should also be deployed.\n\nBlockstream’s Jorge Timon introductory speech also aimed for unity as it illustrated the differences between hard forks, in which the majority of network participants must update their software, and soft forks, which can be updated more gradually.\n\nOverall, Timon sought to propel the audience to work toward non-controversial decisions that could be implemented swiftly, noting that any schism of the network would hurt its value, which would negatively affect all participants.\n\nTimon noted:\n\n“With a hard fork, you’d have an economic balance between two forks in trading. That’s an important point for the pressures for unification. One could fall in price, one might not. You can cannot predict demand for two chains.”\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk received a subsidy to attend to Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong from the event\'s organizers.\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The bank’s Head of e-Commerce, Cristina Karmazin, recently announced that PrivatBank has concluded testing its new service that allows online merchants and e-commerce portals to directly accept Bitcoin payments from their customers. She was speaking at the “Cross-border e-Commerce: the Import to Ukraine” conference held earlier on Thursday at Kiev.\n\nWith the introduction of the new system, the PrivatBank payment gateway will have a Bitcoin payment option. Merchants using PrivatBank’s payment gateway can accept an equivalent value of bitcoins for products and services priced in Ukrainian hryvnia and euro denominations. A customer willing to pay with bitcoins can select the Bitcoin payment option, scan the QR code, and execute the transaction.\n\nOnce the Bitcoin transaction is confirmed, PrivatBank will convert bitcoins to equivalent hryvnia or euros (at the existing market price) depending upon the settings of the merchant’s connected PrivatBank account. With the country’s biggest bank backing the Bitcoin payment processing, online merchants now have a reliable way to accept bitcoins from their customers without worrying about regulatory issues or market volatility.\n\nPrivatBank already has its system ready, and it is now inviting merchants from Ukraine and the rest of Europe to use its services. PrivatBank has already submitted an application with the Central Bank of Ukraine regarding the new service and is expecting to receive the approval soon. However, it is better to get the final word from the Central Bank before we can get our hopes up.\n\nAn increasing number of Eurasian countries are becoming bullish on Bitcoin. Recently GoPay, a leading Czechoslovakian payment processor, announced that the company is including Bitcoin payments in partnership with UK-based BitcoinPay. Russia, however, is an exception, which has recently drafted a law that makes exchanging bitcoins to ruble a punishable offense which can carry up to 4 years of imprisonment.\n\nRussia recently clarified that even though they are against cryptocurrencies, they are more open towards the technology powering it, and Russian financial institutions may start looking to blockchain technology for fund transfer and other applications.', 'Europe-based bitcoin exchange Cex.IO has announced the termination of their support for altcoins and GHash.IO Multipool, shifting their focus toward higher-volume markets such as Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Today’s answer for: How do you encourage creative thinking within your organization? is written by Elaine Leavenworth, SVP and CMO at Abbott.\n\nEvery company is, by definition, the result of a creative impulse and grows only through ongoing imagination and invention. Yet keeping that creative spark burning is a challenge. Our company, Abbott, is in its 128th year. Here are some practices that have helped spur our creativity over the past century:\n\nDream big\n\nInspire employees with goals that matter. Ensuring that people’s work is important and noble will give a sense of mission and can transform the way people approach their jobs.\n\nBe real\n\nPeople don’t want to have to behave artificially or conform to constricting norms. Create a transparent environment and treat your colleagues with respect. If you give everyone permission to be themselves their creativity will naturally be released and you’ll get their best work – a mutual benefit for all involved.\n\nBroaden the view\n\nBuild multi-disciplinary, global teams. The diversity of styles and perspectives can help generate new thinking.\n\nSee also: Here’s why so many companies struggle with innovation\n\nMake it fun\n\nLaughter loosens people up and can generate creative thinking. When you’re comfortable laughing with someone, you’re more likely to be yourself and share ideas. For instance, we’ve brought in the legendary comedy troupe “The Second City” to help us think and behave differently together.\n\nGet out of the office\n\nIt’s important to leave the same old meeting room. If it’s not practical to do this frequently, save it for when you really need the best from your team. A field trip to a new environment can help people make new connections and inspire ideas.\n\nGet out of the chair\n\nGet up, walk around, and talk with colleagues. Any range of conversations – from what your colleague watched on TV last night to your weekend plans – could provide the inspiration you’re looking for.\n\nRead and share\n\nRead broadly.

Just like the fictional Lisbeth Salander, Shyama Rose faced abuse and fought back with an incredible ability to hack. And by total coincidence -- years before the famous series was released -- Rose happened to get a creature tattooed on her back that she says looks like an upside-down chicken, a dragon. Laurie Segall reports.', 'Kate Allen, Political Correspondent DECEMBER 6, 2015 26 Aspiring homeowners will be able to climb onto the property ladder with as little as a £1,400 deposit under government reforms that aim to promote home ownership. The rules on shared ownership properties — homes that people can part-buy and part-rent — will be loosened to open the scheme to 175,000 more households, David Cameron will say on Monday. The move will contribute to the government’s promise to “build a nation of homeowners”, Mr Cameron will say, seeking to set out his party’s election manifesto achievements so far. That included a promise to give “everyone who works hard . . . the chance to own your own home”. Mr Cameron’s announcement is the latest step in what has become the biggest government effort to promote home ownership since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy policy for council house tenants in the 1980s. Rates of home ownership have been falling for more than a decade, from a peak of 71 per cent of English households in 2003 to 63 per cent in 2013-14. That figure has dropped even more steeply among young people: earlier this year the proportion aged 25-34 who owned their home hit a 29-year low of 36 per cent, down from 59 per cent a decade ago. The Conservatives’ election manifesto promised to create 1m homeowners by 2020; in addition, housing minister Brandon Lewis pledged this summer that 1m homes would be built over the same period. From next April, the rules about who is eligible for shared ownership will be relaxed, opening it to anyone with a household income of under £80,000, or under £90,000 in London, the prime minister will say. Existing owners of shared ownership properties will be allowed to use the scheme again. The move comes in addition to a new state-backed subsidy for people buying shared ownership homes that was announced by George Osborne, the chancellor, last month. The Help to Buy scheme, which offers state-backed equity loans and mortgage guarantees, will be extended to include shared ownership properties, covering 135,000 more homes, the chancellor said in his Spending Review. According to Downing Street figures, to use Help To Buy for a shared ownership property in a relatively less expensive area such as Yorkshire, a buyer would need a deposit of as little as £1,400. Other measures announced by the Tories since the election include a relaxation of the planning system and the extension of the Right To Buy to 1.3m housing association tenants. Since the Conservatives first came to power in the coalition government in 2010, 230,000 households have been helped into home ownership through state-backed schemes. On Monday, Mr Cameron will also announce the roll-out of his party’s promise to give parents more free childcare, an extension of the government’s apprenticeships scheme to large public sector employers so that they make up at least 2.3 per cent of their workforce, a crackdown on underperforming schools and plans for childcare providers to use school premises before and after the school day and in school holidays.']"
12/07/2015,"['A Secret Service agent accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin during the US government’s investigation of the now-defunct dark market Silk Road has been sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nShaun Bridges is set to spend the next five years and eleven months in federal prison after the court sided with the prosecution, which asked for the 71-month sentence in a memorandum filed on 30th November.\n\nBridges was charged earlier this year with obstruction of justice and money laundering in connection with the theft of more than $820,000 in bitcoin from accounts connected to the Silk Road.\n\nAccording to a report by Ars Techina, US District Judge Richard Seeborg, who presided over the case, remarked that the case presents “an extremely serious crime consisting of the betrayal of public trust from a public official"".\n\n“From what I can see, it was motivated by greed. No departure or variance is warranted in this case,” he said.\n\nThe defense was unsuccessful in its push for Bridges to receive a three-year sentence. During the hearing, Bridges told the court he accepted full responsibility for his actions and that his theft had cost him and his family dearly, stating:\n\n“I want it to be clear that I accept full responsibility. My wife has lost everything, she went to college to go to law enforcement and now she has lost it all. I just wanted to apologize to everybody.”\n\nBridges’ sentencing comes months after he initially plead guilty to the charges. Another federal agent accused of going rogue during the Silk Road investigation, former Drug Enforcement Agency agent Carl Mark Force IV, was sentenced to 78 months in federal prison after being charged with extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice.\n\nRevelations about Bridges’ and Forces’ actions were originally kept under wraps during the trial of Ross Ulbricht, who was convicted in February and later sentenced to life in prison for operating the Silk Road.\n\nThe full sentencing memorandum can be found below:\n\nSentencing Memorandum\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Charlie Lee is one of them. He is a creator of Litecoin who’s being involved with cryptocurrencies since 2011. As such his knowledge in the field is extensive..\n\nBorn in the Ivory Coast and grown up in the US to parents from Shanghai Charlie was among the first Chinese people to go to Africa in the 1960s. After growing up in Africa, he went to the US for his studies, and after college, he found jobs working for Google.\n\nCharlie Lee is the creator of Litecoin, the most popular alternative currency to Bitcoin. He is currently Director of Engineering at Coinbase. Prior to joining Coinbase, he spent 6 years at Google working on YouTube Mobile, Chrome OS, and the Google Play Games platform. Charlie earned a Bachelors and Masters degree in electrical engineering and computer science from M.I.T. He has a brother Bobby Lee, also well-known in bitcoin space.\n\nLitecoin, one of the first AltCoins to be released, in October 7, 2011, and it isn’t very different from Bitcoin and it’s in effect a fork of it.\n\nWe interviewed Charlie Lee about Litecoin, other Altcoins and “next-gen” Blockchain related projects.\n\nCT: Why have you created Litecoin? What is it aimed to do in respect to Bitcoin?\n\nCharlie Lee: I saw that there was a need for an alternative to Bitcoin. The altcoins released at that time all were flawed. I thought I could do better and it was a good way to learn the Bitcoin codebase. Lastly, it was just fun to create your own coin. Litecoin is very similar to Bitcoin with only few differences: 4x quicker confirmations, 4x more coins, scrypt mining algorithm, more optimal fees to decrease spamdust transactions. In the end, I wanted to create something that complemented Bitcoin.\n\nCT: You say that Litecoin is four times quicker than Bitcoin in confirmation time. That’s an important factor. I recently spoke with Gamecredits developers and they said that their coin block time is around 90 seconds, making transactions confirmations very quick as well. But then, why weren’t your solutions implemented in the Bitcoin core, if it’s so simple to achieve faster confirmations?\n\nCL: Faster confirmations times definitely makes Litecoin more lightweight and easier to use. If you’ve ever sent Litecoins around, you will know what I mean. But it comes with a small tradeoff: there are more block orphans in Litecoin, which means that Litecoin miners waste more resources mining these orphaned blocks. Some argue that the tradeoff is not necessarily worth it. Even if everyone agrees that the tradeoff is worth it, it would take a hard fork to change Bitcoin’s confirmation time, and that risk is definitely not worth it.\n\nCT: Litecoin seems struggling behind Bitcoin, not too differently from many other AltCoins. Do you think that Litecoin is achieving the objective? Is it on the right path, or did you expect more?\n\nCL: Litecoin is following Bitcoin’s footsteps. It’s about two years behind. It’s definitely on the right path. Bitcoin is paving the way for consumer adoption for all of crypto-currency.\n\n“I expect to soon see Litecoin move from a speculative currency to one that’s being used for real world transactions, similar to what’s happening with Bitcoin in the past few years.”\n\nCT: Do you think that Litecoin will follow Bitcoin when it will enter mainstream?\n\nCL: There’s no guarantee that Litecoin will be widely adopted after Bitcoin has entered the mainstream. But that’s definitely a requirement. I will do my best with helping Litecoin adoption once Bitcoin has “made it”.\n\nCT: How do you see the future of AltCoins? How many of them will survive the following years, in your opinion?\n\nCL: There will definitely be consolidation of Altcoins. Most won’t survive in the long run. By survive, I mean have a non-trivial amount of users. It’s next to impossible to have any coin really die, because all you need is one person to run a node to keep that blockchain alive. I do think after a few years, you will see Bitcoin and only a handful of AltCoins be in active use and the rest will not have any significant usage.\n\nCT: In a recent interview published by CoinTelegraph, Andreas Antonopoulos, said that Bitcoin has already reached the “point of no return”, meaning that nothing can kill it already, no matter what governments and banks will try, it’s here to stay. Do you think he’s right, or maybe the future is not so sure yet? Can Bitcoin still be zapped?\n\nCL: I think Andreas is exactly right. I’ve come to that conclusion for a while now. I’ve always thought that it’s not a matter of IF Bitcoin will succeed but WHEN it will. I’ve thought this way pretty much since the moment I first read the Satoshi whitepaper. You cannot shove the genie back into the bottle.\n\n“Sure, entities like governments can slow the adoption of Bitcoin, but they cannot kill it. The concept of a decentralized currency is more powerful than any government bodies.”\n\nCT: How do you see “heavyweight” projects like Ethereum and Maidsafe?\n\nCL: I think projects like Ethereum have a lot of potential. There are a lot of smart people, like Vitalik Buterin, working on this. There are two potential issues with Ethereum: the initial distribution of Ether and the complexity of the protocol. That said, I do look forward to what Ethereum is able to accomplish.\n\nIn the previous days CoinTelegraph has also published an interview with Bobby about the future of Bitcoin and mining.\n\nWhich of the cryptocurrencies are the best? Especially for you we’ve created rating of the top cryptocurrencies.', 'There have been a few proposals to increase the maximum blocksize in Bitcoin over the past year, but the two plans that are garnering the most attention right now are Jeff Garzik’s BIP 100 and Gavin Andresen’s BIP 101. While Andresen has already implemented his plan in BitcoinXT, Garzik is still working on a formal write-up and the code for BIP 100.\n\nAndresen shared his thoughts on BIP 100 via an interview on Epicenter Bitcoin. Although he did not seem completely dismissive of the proposal, it’s clear that he would prefer to go with his own idea for increasing the blocksize, which would offer more predictability in regard to where the blocksize limit will be in the future.\n\nHow BIP 100 Works\n\nWhen asked directly about BIP 100 by Epicenter Bitcoin co-host Sébastien Couture, Andresen was quick to describe the basic way in which the concept is intended to work:\n\n“Jeff [Garzik]’s proposal is that basically the miners get to decide what the next maximum blocksize should be. There’s kind of a regular vote every -- on the order of months.”\n\nAndresen then discussed both BIP 100 and BIP 101 in terms of which proposal would lead to a larger increase in the blocksize limit. The Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist noted that Garzik’s proposal does not come with an immediate increase after it has been implemented, but this does not necessarily mean that it would limit the size of blocks over the short term:\n\n[Garzik] starts with the status quo, so he has no jump-up until the first miner vote. It’s more cautious there. I mean, theoretically, miners could double-up -- he has a maximum of 32 megabyte blocks -- more quickly. So, if miners wanted to and they all voted for the maximum increase every time, we could be at 32 megabytes more quickly than BIP 101, which would probably be OK if the miners are comfortable with that and they think the network can support it, then OK, so be it.”\n\nIs BIP 100 More Conservative?\n\nDue to the unpredictable nature of Garzik’s BIP 100 proposal, it is difficult to tell if the plan would be more or less conservative than Andresen’s BIP 101. Andresen stated:\n\nDepending on how you look at it, it’s either less conservative or more conservative. It’s probably more conservative.”\n\nIf BIP 100 were implemented, it would take a vote from the miners to increase the blocksize limit. In other words, BIP 100 does not increase the blocksize limit by default. It’s also possible that miners could limit the blocksize to a size much smaller than Andresen’s proposed immediate increase to 8 megabytes, which is why some individuals see this proposal as a more conservative approach. On the other hand, miners could vote to increase the maximum blocksize to 32MB in a relatively short period. It is difficult to know which approach would be more conservative without seeing how miners would react to a real-world BIP 100 implementation.\n\nBIP 101 is More Predictable\n\nThe key attribute that Andresen likes about his own plan when compared to BIP 100 is that his comes with a predictable increase in the blocksize limit. He explained the importance of this predictability during his Epicenter Bitcoin interview:\n\nI don’t like it as much as BIP 101. I don’t really care what the rule is, but I really like predictable rules. I really like rules that are -- I know exactly what the maximum blocksize is going to be on, you know, February 15th, 2022. With BIP 101, we know that. It’s set down there in the spec. We know exactly what it’s going to be, in much the same way that we know what the supply of bitcoin is going to be on that date too -- pretty much. [Bitcoin founder] Satoshi [Nakamoto]’s very predictable money supply algorithm for introducing new bitcoins is kind of what inspires me to propose that we just have this limit be very predictable so people can plan... You can do some modeling of what I think the demand for transactions is going to be. You might be able to figure out what the fees are likely to be. All those kinds of things are easier to do if you, kind of, fix this rule as opposed to letting it be miner consensus over time.”\n\nThe majority of the network hashrate is currently supporting Garzik’s BIP 100 solution via a Coinbase blocksize vote on the network. Having said that, miners are not the only Bitcoin users with a say in the matter. Many bitcoin exchanges, wallet providers, and payment processors, such as Circle and Blockchain.info, see value in Andresen’s BIP 101 -- but not necessarily the BitcoinXT fork. Coming to consensus on this matter has proven to be next to impossible up to this point, but it’s possible that we could be approaching a breaking point with all of the recent activity in the debate.\n\nPhoto Web Summit / Flickr(CC)', 'A former White House senior staffer has accepted a role at the best funded miner in bitcoin.\n\nJamie Elizabeth Smith, former deputy White House press secretary and special assistant to President Obama, has joined Bitfury as its global chief of communications. The miner has raised $60m in venture funding to date.\n\nPrior to her roles at the White House, Smith worked at Edelman, a global public relations firm, and was also the director of public affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. She also held senior communications roles at the Senate, for Hilary Clinton\'s 2008 presidential campaign and at former secretary of state Madeleine Albright\'s consulting firm.\n\nSpeaking about her new venture in the crypto space, Smith said in a blog post:\n\n""I believe in the blockchain and the transformation power of this technology. And you should too. In fact, I believe in the blockchain so much that I just left my fantastic job working for Edelman ... to take on the role of global chief of communications at BitFury.""\n\n""So, why would I leave this path to take my chances on the blockchain? And what is the blockchain anyway?"" Smith wrote.\n\nShe elaborated:\n\n""Simply put – the blockchain is an unalterable public ledger where every single bitcoin transaction is recorded, enabling peer-to-peer payments to be made without the need for a bank or other third-party"".\n\nSmith\'s appointment comes after her former colleague Brian Forde – who also held a senior advisory role at the White House – joined the Digital Currency Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab earlier this year.\n\nBitFury\'s advisory board also includes former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chief James Newsome and a deputy assistant attorney general, Jason Weinstein.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Most people who have heard the term think that the ""blockchain"" is only something to do with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, litecoin, doguecoin and others. It\'s the technology that underpins digital currencies and ensures that all transactions are properly conducted and recorded. But what is stored on the blockchain need not be just a currency unit – it can be put to all manner of other interesting uses.\n\nThe blockchain is defined as ""a system that\'s secure without a higher authority, distributed across many strangers\' computers, yet tamper-proof, and promises a mechanism for trust mediated directly between individuals"". Essentially, by providing a distributed means to guarantee and verify transactions, the blockchain offers the ultimate opportunity to cut out the middleman.\n\nA key aspect is the programmable smart contract: code stored on the blockchain that automatically executes when certain conditions have been met. In uses that involve a financial transaction, it makes sense to use bitcoin or some other digital currency for the same reason – by doing so, transactions can be automated and guaranteed without recourse to third parties, such as a bank.\n\nNot all uses involve payments. For example, Kim Jackson and Zach LeBeau were married on the blockchain in November. Is a blockchain marriage legally binding? Well, some parts of it would fall within contract law, but it\'s a first symbolic step.\n\nMany major companies are looking to the blockchain as a way to simplify and strengthen supply chains, where the blockchain could record each step a product has taken. For example, it could be used to guarantee the origin of foods.\n\nIn other cases, the blockchain can be used for peer-to-peer exchange or sale. Imagine you have an electric car. When your charger is unused, you can rent it out to other car owners, paid in bitcoins via a blockchain smart contract.\n\nAutomating the home, with blockchain. Credit: ariadna de raadt/shutterstock.com\n\nAnother use is automated security, using code embedded on the blockchain to trigger granting or denying access depending on the requester. This way security is assured, as no third parties are involve and no one holds the ""keys"": the lock has become one with the key, and assurance lies in the distributed trust of a shared, anonymous network.\n\nOne firm supplying this is Slock. The owner can set a deposit amount and a price for renting a property, which the user pays through a blockchain transaction (not even Slock is a middleman), which permits the user to open and close the smart lock through their smartphone. It\'s a lock activated by money, without any need for third-party authority. And it\'s not just start-ups such as Slock that are taking notice – bigger players, including IBM, are onto it too.\n\nDecentralising everything\n\nA radically different application comes from Bitnation, a project aimed at using blockchain to decentralise governance. Bitnation is offering victims of the refugee crisis an emergency digital ID and bitcoin-based credit card which can be used to receive funds from family members or friends without bank accounts.\n\nWith this it is possible for an individual to prove their existence and identity through family relations cryptographically, recorded on the blockchain like a distributed public ledger. This acts as a sort of international notary public. Bitnation works by generating a QR code – a barcode – which can be used with a cellphone to apply for a bitcoin credit card which can be used throughout Europe and the UK without a bank account.\n\nBlockchain automation\n\nAustralian software firm Edgelogic offers a glimpse of how blockchain technology could be used at home, a bridge between digital payments and the Internet of Things. For example, a sensor could report to the blockchain when it detects damp, an alert which triggers a set of instructions that transfers cash for repairs from an insurer to a claimant\'s account, even before the person knows anything is wrong.\n\nA digital crypto-currency has just launched that is generated by human movement. Bitwalking dollars can be earned simply by walking, unlike other digital currencies such as bitcoins that require ""mining"" though using computers to solve cryptographic problems. With Bitwalking, a phone app counts and verifies users\' steps and walkers earning approximately BW$1 for every 10,000 steps (about five miles). These can be spent in an online store, or traded for cash.\n\nWhile some ideas may seem like solutions looking for a problem, others are more closely tied to real needs. They redefine what use the blockchain could be put to – eliminating the need for banks, or even for aspects of government. It\'s clear that the blockchain has expanded beyond bitcoin and cryptocurrencies – but as with all disruptive technologies, in which direction it will be taken remains to be seen.\n\nExplore further: Goldman Sachs seeks patent on virtual currency', 'Taavet Hinrikus, the CEO of fintech startup TransferWise, had harsh words for bitcoin on Monday morning, claiming that the digital currency’s growth has been driven by “greed,” and that nobody actually wants to use it.\n\nSpeaking at London tech conference TechCrunch Disrupt, Hinrikus told TechCrunch’s editor-at-large Mike Butcher: ""We’re very much a consumer-led company. The trouble with bitcoin is nobody’s asking for it.""\n\nHe added: ""I think the growth of bitcoin has probably been driven mostly by greed, by people thinking ‘oh the value must — can only — go up.’ I think we’re kind of seeing that cool down now.""\n\nIt’s certainly true that the bitcoin currency markets are full of speculators, and the price is highly volatile. During 2015, it has varied between $175 (£116) and more than $400 (£265) per bitcoin. It’s currently sitting at around $395 (£262), down from an all-time high of more than $1,100 (£730) in late 2013.\n\nSome bitcoin startups are also starting to turn their backs on bitcoin due to a lack of consumer interest. Bitcoin wallet and exchange Bitreserve rebranded in October 2015 as Uphold, distancing itself from the currency. It now pitches itself as a more general online wallet.\n\nCEO Anthony Watson told Business Insider that it’s the blockchain — not bitcoin itself — that’s a big deal, saying: ""I don’t think bitcoin is going to be anywhere near as important as people say it is today. That’s a personal view. The blockchain is very transformative.""\n\nIn June, meanwhile, bitcoin company BitPay told Business Insider: ""We keep adding merchants — we’re up to over 60,000 now — but they’re selling to the same pool of bitcoin early adopters."" The currency is failing to attract new users.\n\nHarsher words come from Robert Mohland, who built dogetipbot, an tipping tool that lets users tip others with digital currencies online. He open-sourced the tool in November and moved onto a new project, calling bitcoin ""a solution looking for a problem"" and claiming that traditional finance is ""more profitable and desirable"" for ordinary users, Coindesk reported.\n\nBitcoin is a decentralised currency — there’s no central bank regulating transactions. Instead, it uses complex cryptography to let users send bitcoin to each other, with all these transactions recorded on the “blockchain” — a public ledger shared between everyone on the network.\n\nBitcoin’s advocates argue it could revolutionise the global financial system, doing away with the need for the majority of traditional financial structures. But many within finance think that the efficiencies of the blockchain can be incorporated into existing institutions. Hinrikus said at TechCrunch Disrupt that the blockchain — the technology that underpins bitcoin — is ""much more exciting.""\n\nTransferWise is one of the hottest fintech — or financial technology — startups in Europe. It’s focused on transferring money abroad, and promises to be eight times cheaper than banks by using clever peer-to-peer technology.\n\nThis cross-border money transfer is one of the areas where bitcoin enthusiasts claim the digital currency has significant advantages over traditional currencies — you can send huge amounts around the world for very low costs.\n\nKristo Kaarman, TransferWise’s co-founder, told Business Insider earlier this year: ""We’re very excited about the blockchain as a concept. I don’t think anyone’s really clocked how to use it for moving money locally, let alone internationally.\n\n""There is a little bitcoin economy starting but all the other things... it’s just too early to know if there is a real use case for it and how people will use it. I’d say we’re monitoring the space.""\n\nThe mainstream financial industry is currently looking closely at the blockchain as a way to revolutionise finance. Goldman Sachs says in a recent note that the blockchain ""can change … well everything"" and 30 banks have joined an industry-wide partnership looking for use cases for the blockchain.', 'According to multiple sources close to Overstock, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a S-3 filing for online retailer Overstock.com (NASDAQ: OSTK) to issue new publicly traded shares of the company on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAn Overstock spokesperson declined to comment on the situation but said that the company would be issuing a formal statement in the next 48 hours.\n\nForm S-3 is a securities registration form that gives companies a simplified process for issuing publicly traded securities. Unlike Form S-1, which is the comprehensive filing required for companies which plan to hold an initial public offering (IPO) of their stock, the S-3 is for companies that already have achieved a certain level of compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, a company must have at least 12 months of properly filed reports with the SEC to be eligible to file an S-3.\n\nOverstock’s t0 (tee-zero) platform has been working on bringing equity trades and settlement to the blockchain since it was first announced in April 2015. In July, Overstock sold the first cryptobond on the blockchain. As a proof of concept, FNY Managed Accounts agreed to buy the $5 million bond, with assurances in place in case the technology failed.\n\nIn an effort to enter the financial industry, t0 acquired Wall Street brokerage firm SpeedRoute for $30.3 million in August 2015. “It’s a routing service that is connected to all 11 exchanges and 25 dark pools in the United States, it’s a very significant node within the national market already … We knew that we wanted to bring the blockchain to Wall Street and rather than build it in isolation and try to get people to adopt it, if we bought a node within the national market system and then built the crypto on top of it so it was all regulatory compliant and speaks the technology of FinTech … We didn’t want to be a Mt.Gox trying to build something and sneak it past the regulators,” said CEO Patrick Byrne in an interview with the Tabb Forum .\n\nFor Overstock, though, issuing shares of the company on its platform is a viable proof of concept. Fundamentally, t0 operates with the mentality that “the trade is the settlement.” In traditional equity trades today, the markets operate on a trade date plus three days (T+3) settlement mechanism in which the exchange of payment and securities can take up to three days to settle. With the blockchain, it can be instantaneous and occur at the same time as the trade.\n\nThe t0 platform is built utilizing colored coin technology, which allows for fractions of bitcoin to be used to track ownership of many assets besides bitcoin. For example, a colored coin could be used as a token to prove that an individual owns shares of Overstock. This technology is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and is secured by the distributed public ledger.\n\nJacob Cohen Donnelly is a consultant and journalist in the bitcoin space. He runs a weekly newsletter about bitcoin called Crypto Brief.', 'In this morning’s bitcoin price watch article, we noted the levels that we would be focusing on during today’s European session. The levels in focus were in term resistance at $400 flat (weekend highs) and in term support at $382.77 – the most recent swing low, tested and held on numerous occasions. Action has now matured across the European afternoon, and these levels look to remain relevant in light of the current price.\n\nHowever, in an attempt to stimulate some activity, we are going to tighten up this evening’s range in anticipation of a breakout. So, with this said, let’s take a brief look at today’s action, and see if we can define our parameters for tonight’s Asian session. As ever, take a quick look at the chart below to get an idea of our range.\n\nAs the chart shows, we are going to maintain $400 flat as in term resistance, as this has once again been tested this afternoon, and remains valid as the most recent swing high. Looking the other way, we are going to raise in term support to $392.66. This level has proven itself on a couple of occasions in the past, and as our most recent swing low, is an ideal focus region.\n\nIf we get a break above the aforementioned $400 flat, we will look for a close above this level to validate an upside entry, with an initial target of $410 flat. With about ten dollars’ of reward on offer, we’ve got five dollars’ risk available to us according to our predefined risk parameters. We probably wont need to use the full five dollars, however, so a stop around $397 looks good.\n\nLooking to the downside, a close below support will put us short towards $382.56. Again, this is a ten-dollar trade, so a stop in the region of $395 looks attractive.\n\nCharts courtesy of Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

It’s neither their first step in raising funds nor the last one. The company has used multiple instruments to attract investment. CoinPayments’ Chief Marketing Officer Ward Stirrat told CoinTelegraph about their experience in working with different instruments for fundraising.\n\nHe told that such instruments can help build a bridge between the Bitcoin community and traditional sector. Traditional brick and mortar companies just need to “learn the language” of Bitcoin community in order to attract investments from them.\n\nCT: What are the main instruments for raising funds in crypto space? How do they work?\n\nWard Stirrat: If we talk about crypto space, we should mention debt offering when people are just offering the percentage of the company. But the actual share allocation is not preset so they just ask people for money with a promise to pay them back in shares later. The problem is that the price of the shares is not determined at the time of investments. Nevertheless, companies use the method quite often.\n\nI think it’ll suite if you are a very young company with little business traction, customers and history. And in that case it’s a good strategy. We did it as well. We sold out 4% of our company’s shares via the Bank to the Future platform.\n\nHowever, companies often come out to ask for money very early. They adopt selling a lot of their company in order to get money from investors where it’s very speculative. In our case we’ve chosen to prove that there really was a market demand; that company could make some money and be self-sustaining before we went out.\n\nThere are more options for fundraising as well – tokens and coins. We’ve helped a lot of people raise money using tokens and coins as means of fundraising. Companies from crypto space can create their own coin or token to attract investors. There were such cases with Ethereum, Maidsafe, Ripple and other blockchain related and decentralized businesses. They used their own currency to ask the world to support their efforts. So I think it is a very interesting and growing trend in the industry.\n\nBesides, it appears to be quite fruitful. Ethereum managed to raise 62 millions of dollars with its Ether. Ripple raised 38 million dollars. And those are quite significant amounts of value in crypto space.\n\nAnother good example is StartCOIN – a coin used specifically for crowdfunding. We worked with Bank to the Future platform helping them fundraise with their StartCOIN. We’re still the only payment processor to accept StartCOIN. And they raised about 1 million dollars just having people invest in StartCOIN.\n\nThere are other ideas we’re working on as well. We do a lot of exploring trying to develop some hybridized ideas. For example, we have some apps and a mobile POS coming soon. And we’ll share them with the community when we’re ready.\n\nCT: Do you plan to use some other kinds of instruments for fundraising in the future?\n\nWS: Yes. Tokens and coins themselves represent a large opportunity in this space to raise funds. We did a presentation of it with Helix for National Crowdfunding Association of Canada here in Vancouver. And I guess I have made a comparison between now that we have 185 geographical currencies that are fiat and the possibility to do the same with crypto coins.\n\nWe have the early beginnings of what I call mine share currencies. The idea is that people could help the businesses they like to become successful. And each of those businesses can have its own coin or token turning into coin. It’s a great way to raise funds. For example, Maidsafe could raise about 8 millions of dollars just for the token sale in the course of 48 hours. And Ethereum had a much more significant success with their Ether.\n\nThese kinds of opportunities are really worthy. I see the big growth, specifically in our area. I believe it will become the fundraising method of choice. Mine share currencies are currencies like Ether and Ripple. If you like the company’s efforts and you would like to help it build its business; you can simply do that just by buying their coins or tokens. There are lots of new ideas that can gain their start with coins. That is one of the reasons CoinPayments is to be looked at. We’re open to have the largest coin wallet in the world. We added Ethereum immediately when it became available so people could pay for things using Ether. That basically allows for growth of the new currency that comes.\n\nCT: And what about companies that are not from Bitcoin and Blockchain industry, brick and mortar companies? Is it possible for them to use the fundraising methods that you use?\n\nWS: I think it’s a new paradigm that is evolving now. One of the great things about Ethereum is the invention of smart contracts. They allow a whole bunch of new enterprise to be funded or pre-funded with selling future agreements. I think in that case there is a really interesting opportunity to involve more companies to participate in that. It could be not only enterprises from brick and mortar but also companies from other industries – entertainment, for example.\n\nCT: The main problem is that brick and mortar companies seem to be unable to attract audience from Bitcoin sector to invest in their tokens. Bitcoin community representatives simply don’t pay attention to such projects. Is there any way to solve this problem?\n\nWS: I think we are doing it now with our hybridized apps. We are helping build the bridge between the two communities. That’s simple enough. You don’t necessarily need to force one party to learn the language of another. You just build the bridge between them. And over time they’ll understand what’s going on. And that’s what we do in CoinPayments moving forward with our new initiative. We’re building an easy bridge for people to move between traditional payments and crypto payments.\n\nCT: Can you give some advice to brick and mortar companies that want to attract Bitcoin investments?\n\nWS: They have to speak the language of crypto community in order to play this game. They have to explain their projects in a way that makes sense particularly for Bitcoin community. I don’t think that crypto community is going to move towards understanding what the specific business is at all. They’re just going to understand how this business opportunity can be applied on the Blockchain ledger and cryptocurrency tokens or otherwise models.\n\n“Brick and mortar companies need to find someone from the crypto community and to articulate their business objectives, pointing out the way that intermediary company could help them create a token or a message and frame everything up. Crypto community should understand clearly what the investment opportunity is.”\n\nThe ability to make an independent token or coin is very important in that. It is very important that both communities start interacting because it is a huge opportunity. So the brick and mortar businesses need to understand how to translate their goals in the language that the crypto community speaks. I think once that’s done, crypto community will embrace their ideas.\n\nAre you interested in the theme of this article?

12/08/2015,"[""Exclusive: Police search home belonging to Australian entrepreneur and academic, who tech publications claim was key to creation of cryptocurrency and could be figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nPolice have raided the home of an Australian tech entrepreneur identified by two US publications as one of the early developers of the digital currency bitcoin.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, police gained entry to a home belonging to Craig Wright, who had hours earlier been identified in investigations by Gizmodo and Wired, based on leaked transcripts of legal interviews and files. Both publications have indicated that they believe Wright to have been involved in the creation of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto probably Australian entrepreneur, reports claim Read more\n\nOther people who say they knew Wright have expressed strong doubts about his alleged role, with some saying privately they believe the publications have been the victims of an elaborate hoax.\n\nMore than 10 police personnel arrived at the house in the Sydney suburb of Gordon at about 1.30pm. Two police staff wearing white gloves could be seen from the street searching the cupboards and surfaces of the garage. At least three more were seen from the front door.\n\nThe Australian Federal police said in a statement that the raids were not related to the bitcoin claims. “The AFP can confirm it has conducted search warrants to assist the Australian Taxation Office at a residence in Gordon and a business premises in Ryde, Sydney. This matter is unrelated to recent media reporting regarding the digital currency bitcoin.”\n\nOne officer told Reuters they were “clearing the house”. Reuters reporter Jane Wardell said Wright’s offices were also being raided.\n\nThe house was the only one on the street with a rubbish bin still outside, six days after the weekly Thursday collection, and the letterbox was full, indicating that the house may have been empty recently.\n\nWho is Craig Wright and how likely is it that he's behind bitcoin? Read more\n\nGarry Hayres, the owner of the property, now based in Maroochydore, Queensland, told Guardian Australia that Wright and his wife Ramona Watts had leased the property in November 2012.\n\nHe only met Watts, “a lovely lady”, but said the couple were “typical tenants. They didn’t look after the place fantastically, but it wasn’t their home. They didn’t seem bad.”\n\nHe said they switched to from a full lease to month-by-month about six months ago, before informing him in the first week of December of their intention to leave.\n\nWright told him they were moving to London; he would go first, then Watts would follow.\n\nThe couple extended the lease by an extra week, taking them to the first week of January.\n\n\n\nA neighbour said a huge container arrived about a month ago, followed by a small remover’s truck in the first week of December.\n\nHe said Watts was a “pleasant lady” but described Wright as a “cold fish Craig”.\n\n“Everybody talks on this street, but not with him. I don’t waste my time. He showed no interest, totally kept to himself.”\n\nHe said the couple had at least one child, a boy of about 16, as well as possibly a younger girl.\n\nThe identity of the founder of the software – known pseudonymously as Satoshi Nakamoto – has never been revealed, despite numerous attempts by news organisations to uncover it.\n\nWright is involved in a number of tech enterprises in Australia, company records show.\n\nThe documents published by Gizmodo appear to show records of an interview with the Australian Tax Office surrounding his tax affairs in which his bitcoin holdings are discussed at length.\n\nDuring the interview, the person the transcript names as Wright says: “I did my best to try and hide the fact that I’ve been running bitcoin since 2009 but I think it’s getting – most – most – by the end of this half the world is going to bloody know.”\n\nGuardian Australia has been unable to independently verify the authenticity of the transcripts published by Gizmodo, or whether the transcript is an accurate reflection of the audio if the interview took place. It is also not clear whether the phrase “running” refers merely to the process of mining bitcoin using a computer.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Australian Tax Office was unable to confirm whether the meetings with the ATO and Wright had taken place due to “obligations around confidentiality under the law”.\n\nThere is also no record publicly available of proceedings Wright was apparently involved in at Australia’s Administrative Appeals Tribunal surrounding his tax affairs, mentioned in the leaked documents.\n\nThe purported admission in the transcript does not state that Wright is a founder of the currency, but other emails that Gizmodo claim are from Wright suggest further involvement he may have had in the development of bitcoin.\n\nAn email to a Clayton Utz lawyer identified as Wright’s lawyer in the ATO transcripts was sent from an address linked to Nakamoto and is signed “Craig (possibly).”\n\nBitcoins really are useful. But not in the way you think | John Naughton Read more\n\nThe email discussed whether contact should be made with Australia’s then assistant treasurer Arthur Sinodinos in January 2014 over the regulatory issues in Australia surrounding bitcoin.\n\nThe treatment of bitcoin for tax purposes in Australia has been the subject of considerable debate. The ATO ruled in December 2014 that cryptocurrency should be considered an asset for capital gains tax purposes.\n\nThe emails published by Gizmodo cannot been verified. Comment has been sought from Sinodinos on whether he was contacted by Wright – or his lawyer – in relation to bitcoin and its regulatory and taxation status in Australia.\n\nA third email published by Gizmodo from 2008 attributes to Wright a comment where he said: “I have been working on a new form of electronic money. Bit cash, bit coin …”\n\nWright has also claimed to be a consultant for the Australian federal police. Guardian Australia understands the AFP have not been able to find any records of this association.\n\nWhen Guardian Australia contacted the media number listed for one of Wright’s companies and asked whether Wright was the founder of bitcoin the person who answered the phone hung up.\n\nNathaniel Popper, a reporter on Wall Street for the New York Times, tweeted he was emailed by someone attempting to unmask Wright, but he “didn’t find it convincing at the time”.\n\nIn subsequent tweets, having read both the Wired and Gizmodo investigations, Popper acknowledged there was some evidence to tie Wright to Satoshi. “The details of the Wright-Satoshi link are very convincing but where I get stuck is the personality.”"", 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shaun Bridges stole $820,000 (£546,000) of the online currency, bitcoin\n\nA former US Secret Service agent has been jailed for six years for stealing electronic currency while investigating the Silk Road online marketplace, according to the Associated Press (AP).\n\nShaun Bridges took $820,000 (£546,000) in bitcoin after accessing Silk Road.\n\nHe admitted money laundering and obstruction charges in August.\n\nUS District Judge Richard Seeborg said Bridges\' behaviour was a ""shocking and reprehensible abandonment of his public duty"".\n\nPassing sentence on Monday, the judge said ""This, to me, is an extremely serious crime consisting of the betrayal of public trust by a federal law enforcement agent,"" the AP reported.\n\n""And from everything I see, it was motivated entirely by greed.""\n\nAs a member of the US Secret Service, Bridges was part of a task force investigating the Silk Road marketplace, which was used by some to trade illegal items. It was closed in 2013 following raids by the FBI and other agencies.\n\n\'Illustrious career\'\n\nHaving gained access to the online bazaar, Bridges stole the online currency and tried to pin it on a witness who was cooperating with the investigation, prompting Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht to take out hits on the witness\' life, prosecutors said at Monday\'s hearing.\n\nThe judge said it was ""inexcusable"" for a federal agent to put a cooperating witness at risk in that way. Bridges told the judge before his sentencing that he had accepted responsibility for his crime and had not spent any of the money he took.\n\n""I obviously have lost a lot, a very illustrious career,"" he said. His lawyer sought a three-year sentence, but the judge gave him a jail term of five years and 11 months, the AP reported.\n\nUlbricht was sentenced to life in prison in May after he was convicted over his operation of the website for nearly three years from 2011 until his 2013 arrest.\n\nProsecutors said he collected $18m in bitcoin through commissions on tens of thousands of drug sales while operating the site using the alias, ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" an apparent reference to a main character in ""The Princess Bride,"" the 1987 comedy film based on a novel of the same name.\n\nA Drug Enforcement Administration agent on the Silk Road task force, Carl Force, was charged separately with selling information about the investigation and pleaded guilty to extortion and other charges. He was sentenced to six years in prison in October.', 'A newly introduced proposal for how the bitcoin network can be scaled to handle greater transaction volumes is gaining traction in its once divided development community.\n\nCalled segregated witness, the proposal was debuted by Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong on 7th December. Arriving to general acclaim, it has already been hailed as a ""turning point"" by technologist Andreas Antonopoulos and positioned by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell as a solution that could provide a fourfold increase in capacity to the network in a ""short time frame"".\n\nMost notable about segregated witness is that, unlike other proposed bitcoin improvements, it can be introduced to the network as a soft fork, meaning that it would avoid forcing all those running the bitcoin software to upgrade their clients in near-unison, thereby reducing the risk an upgrade splits the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThat this could be accomplished has come as a surprise to many in the community, which has been embroiled in debate on how to scale the network in line with the ambitions of a startup sector which has attracted nearly $1bn in investments in 2015.\n\nWuille himself said in his talk that he had dismissed segregated witness as “non-viable” until recently, when it was revealed that it can be implemented as either a hard or soft fork, and there is growing consensus in the community that a soft fork is a preferred path to a solution.\n\nEven more objective observers such as Digital Asset Holdings senior developer Miron Cuperman told CoinDesk:\n\n“There’s consensus that a soft fork is better. You can deploy it much sooner, because you just need the large majority, and in a hard fork you have to upgrade everyone. It’s a straightforward idea, the concept is not that risky or complicated.”\n\nAt an open developer meetup hosted at Cyberport in Hong Kong today, the solution was widely seen positively, though a certain minority expressed their concern that it would delay a hard fork – a process they believe will eventually be needed for later scaling solutions.\n\nOthers, such as developer and hosted mining service provider Jonathan Toomim, argued that the segregated witness proposal was perhaps best implemented via a hard fork to improve its design and overall functionality.\n\n“My attitude is it’s ugly and awkward and that this is not a way that’s intuitive. I just see that they’re putting segregated witness here because it will be a soft fork, but that is better off as a hard fork, where it will be more elegant and safer,” he told CoinDesk.\n\nThe segregated witness code has already been introduced as a hard fork in Sidechain Elements, a sandbox in which developers can experiment with its proposed sidechains functionality and features.\n\nNonetheless, Wuille said he will move forward with formalizing the idea as a bitcoin improvement protocol (BIP) so it can be more widely discussed by the larger bitcoin community.\n\nHe told CoinDesk expects this to be completed in a ""number of weeks"", though the exact timeline is not yet clear.\n\nThe segregated witness solution\n\nSegregated witness is perhaps best described as a novel workaround to the block size issue that affects how certain network variables are counted toward block size.\n\nIn bitcoin, transactions include one or more input fields showing where the funds come from, one or more output fields indicating where they’re going and a signature that validates that the owner had the ability to execute the transaction.\n\n""Now signatures go into the \'from\' field,"" Lightning Network developer Tadge Dryja explained. ""[In segregated witness] the signature is separate.""\n\nMore specifically, segregated witness takes the signature out of the transaction and puts the data into a Merkle tree in the coinbase component of the transaction, or the input of a generated transaction. This change would make transactions appear smaller to current nodes on the network, so that more could be included in a bitcoin block, even if blocks are still limited to 1MB by protocol rules.\n\n“If the signatures would add 0.75MB [of capacity] to a block to a 1MB block, it would now be equivalent to 4MB,” developer Doug Roark said, echoing the description put forth by Maxwell and Wuille.\n\nDryja noted that a soft fork would mean parties running older versions of Bitcoin Core could still use bitcoin, even if it would appear to them as if users were sending money without signatures.\n\n“Nodes today only see the transaction Merkle root and the transaction data, which today includes the signature,” David Vorick, CEO of distributed storage startup Nebulous, explained. “If segregated witness were to be implemented, today’s nodes would not see the transaction signature data, because it would be in a storage area that they don’t recognize.”\n\nOlder nodes that have not updated their software would still however be able to monitor the network, though it would appear as if certain parties are behaving abnormally.\n\n""[In a soft fork] nothing changes, my coins are still the same, which is different than everyone must upgrade their software or it stops working,"" Dryja said. ""Things start looking really weird, but they can ignore these transactions.""\n\nTangential benefits\n\nAnother proposed benefit to segregated witness was that it would allow for other scaling proposals to be more effectively implemented.\n\nDryja, for example, told CoinDesk that segregated witness would allow his proposed version of payment channels to reach their maximum efficiency based on projections he presented on day two of the event.\n\nSegregated witness would also fix transaction malleability, a longstanding issue on the network whereby when transactions are signed, the signature does not cover all the data in the transaction.\n\n“Without segregated witness, if one of us puts money into the address, the other party can resign the transaction, changing the transaction ID,” Dryja indicated. “When you resign in segregated witness, the signatures are not in the transactions.”\n\nTransaction malleability is perhaps most widely known as the source of controversy during the collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, which sought to claim the issue was the cause of withdrawal issues before its collapse.\n\nMining problems\n\nHowever, fixing transaction malleability this way could have the side effect of at least temporarily destabilizing other parts of the network.\n\nToomim was the most vocal in his concerns that the design of segregated witness could have an impact on the mining community that has perhaps not been properly evaluated.\n\nOf issue, Toomim said, is that miners use coinbase messages in blocks to include vital information for their business. This includes votes on various BIP proposals and bookkeeping details such as the fact they mined the block in which the coins were included.\n\n""It’s co-opting a resource that is already being used for a lot of things, and that resource was not designed for that,"" he argued.\n\nSince the coinbase is also the first part of data blocks compiled by miners today, Toomim said that adding signatures to this field would make it dependent on other information in the block, which could potentially complicate mining software.\n\nOverall, he said he was excited about the idea, but that these effects could be averted if segregated witness was implemented as a hard fork.\n\nWith this design, he explained, block headers could contain merkle roots wherein one side of the tree would contain transactions, and the other would contain signature data, creating a mirrored structure that would be more easily scaled. By comparison, as a soft fork, the merkle tree containing transactions would be added to the coinbase.\n\nWhile a minority view, the comments could gain relevance given the emphasis developers at the event put on seeking solutions for a block size that would not affect mining profitability.\n\nPolitical football\n\nBut while segregated witness has attracted enthusiasm, there is some suggestion it could become the focal point for a larger discussion on whether the community needs to solve its scalability issues with a hard fork for academic reasons.\n\nSuch a view was most loudly voiced by Core developer Jeff Garzik in his talk on BIP proposals on day one of Scaling Bitcoin. There, he made the argument that there is a lack of data on how a distributed economic system like bitcoin would react when faced with this challenge.\n\nUnder any proposal, changing the cap on block size would require a hard fork, meaning that such instances are likely to occur, perhaps regularly, as bitcoin scales. Given this, some were more blunt in their criticism of the reluctance to pursue this path.\n\n""The Core devs haven’t done a hard fork. They’re afraid of it. They need to get over it. I don’t think the hard fork-soft fork is really an issue,"" Toomim said.\n\nDryja’s opinion represented the more moderate view that any chosen scaling initiative should provide additional necessary technical fixes to the network.\n\n""They’ve wanted to fix malleability for years,"" he said. ""We want to have more capacity. If we’re gonna make this change, why don’t we also fix a bunch of other stuff?""\n\nFor more information on segregated witness, read Wuille\'s full slideshow below:\n\nMagic image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Its last event, the third instalment of its DevCore workshops series held in San Mateo, California on 16th October, earned just $2,000 in sponsorship fees.\n\nThe foundation has embarked on cost-cutting measures to staunch the flow of cash. September board meeting minutes show that it was spending ""5 to 10%"" of the ""previous budget"". The foundation was spending $150,000 a month as recently as last May, according to minutes released at the time. It was operating with a different board and staff led by then executive director Jon Matonis.\n\nBurn rates and runway\n\nCurrent foundation spending would stand at $7,500 a month, based on 5% of a $150,000 monthly budget. The foundation had a balance of $59,000, according to minutes from the July board meeting. Based on these estimates, the foundation has funds until next March.\n\nFoundation executive director Bruce Fenton said at the October meeting:\n\n""We need to do serious fundraising ... Revenue is key, we can\'t do much more to cut expenses.""\n\nThe foundation currently employs two part-time staff. Fenton runs the organisation as a volunteer. The board pinned much of the expenditure on commitments made by the previous regime. This included vendor invoices, past employee expenses, paid vacation expenses and legal bills.\n\nA new board was elected in March amid drama. Candidates complained about an overhaul of the voting system, poor voter outreach and allegations that the organisation was bankrupt.\n\nDisputes over unsettled payments were also aired at the October meeting. Interim executive director Patrick Murck is yet to be reimbursed $12,000 in travel expenses for attending a DevCore workshop in London in April. Former chairman Peter Vessenes meanwhile still owes the foundation between $8,000 and $18,000, depending on whether his claims of unpaid travel expenses are accepted. Vessenes disputes this.\n\nMissing bitcoins?\n\nThe foundation\'s monetary woes are compounded by the fact that some of its bitcoins may have been lost, according to Fenton.\n\nThe organisation had an early Avalon miner, which should have generated significant bitcoin holdings. But Fenton was pessimistic about tracking and recovering any potentially lost coins, although Pierce suggested contacting a blockchain analytics company to attempt to trace any lost funds.\n\nThe meeting also discussed ways to make more money off the DevCore workshops, including a share of revenue by partnering with conference organiser Inside Bitcoins. A similar idea was mooted to partner with this publication at the September meeting, but CoinDesk never received a proposal from the foundation.\n\nPierce wrapped up the meeting by asking board members to pledge to raise $10,000 each before the next meeting in a months\' time. Only Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTCC said yes. Jim Harper, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said he would ""do what he could"" while entrepreneur Olivier Janssens demurred, citing the foundation\'s poor image as a major obstacle.\n\nIn response, Pierce tried to rally his board, underlining the seriousness of the foundation\'s financial problems:\n\n""We are the Foundation, we have no resources, this is us, if you don’t like the foundation as it stands, you don’t like yourself ... each board member should be prepared to do the work themselves, to keep the Foundation going.""\n\nFenton pledged a $10,000 donation of his own money if the rest of the board were committed to the exercise. Ribbit Capital\'s Micky Malka and BitPay\'s Elizabeth Ploshay were absent.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Now, many experts are discussing what will happen with the Blockchain in the future and what technology will be used. In the area of Bitcoin there were many startups, but most of them did not find application. What will be the future of Bitcoin and the Blockchain in 5 years?\n\nVitalik Buterin co-founder of Ethereum, the decentralized web 3.0 publishing platform. He is currently working on implementing Ethereum 2.0. Vitalik answered a few questions specifically for CoinTelegraph.\n\n\n\nCoinTelegraph: The most interesting question today is that of the next generation for cryptocurrency. What will be the next step in evolution after Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin?\n\nVitalik Buterin: So, there are a few research directions that I think are important. Perhaps the most important one is scalability; right now, blockchains are capable of processing only about 4-20 transactions per second, and the primary reason why that is the case is that they have this fundamental limitation that every node in the network must process every transaction. Hence, unlike other decentralized systems (eg. BitTorrent) that get _more_ powerful the more nodes join the network, blockchains actually get weaker, at least in terms of transaction throughput, the more participants they have (because the network grows and so the latency increases logarithmically, whereas the power of each node does not increase at all). There are two main routes to solving this problem:\n\n“State channels Sharding, ie. having different nodes process different transactions, so each transaction is only processed by a small subset of nodes”\n\nThe second one is integrating stronger cryptography. There are a lot of projects already that are getting interested in linkable ring signatures, which provide moderately strong privacy properties, and the next step will likely be the community getting its hands on zero-knowledge proofs (specifically zk-SNARKs), which are a much more powerful beast and capable of providing strongly privacy-preserving guarantees of almost any kind of mathematical claim. This could be useful for the simple purpose of creating in-protocol (or in Ethereum\'s case, super-protocol) currency mixers, but there are also more complex applications that have privacy needs, eg. financial contracts, identity and reputation data, multisig escrows.\n\nCT: What should new features be in cryptocurrency in order for it to succeed?\n\nVB: Regarding cryptocurrency specifically, I think that right now in order for a new cryptocurrency to really succeed in the payments space specifically, it needs to offer some kind of monetary policy advantage over bitcoin proper. One route here is the ""stablecoin"" approach: come up with an asset which is designed to have lower (or possibly zero) volatility against something like the dollar or SDR by having another high-volatility asset ""absorb"" its volatility. Otherwise, the best thing to do to help small-scale coins get adopted is better development of ""universal gateways"": services that make it easy for customers and merchants to pay each other in different currencies and convert as needed.\n\n“My vision for the crypto consumer-merchant-payments infrastructure architecture of the future is one where the customer declares the set of currencies S that they are willing to pay in, the merchant declares the set of currencies T they are willing to accept, then if S and T have an intersection you pay in whatever both are happy with and otherwise you use pathfinding algorithms over decentralized markets to find the cheapest way to exchange between something the customer is happy to give and something the merchant is willing to accept.”\n\nCT: Scalability is Bitcoin’s main issue - What are your thoughts on this?\n\nVB: Particularly, note that scalability isn\'t just a problem that we will have some far day in the future, it\'s a problem now. The reason is that if we can solve scalability today, then we can reduce the cost of a blockcain transaction by 100x, say from $0.04 to $0.0004. At those levels, using blockchains for many things will become dirt cheap, and people will start using blockchains as high-reliability application deployment infrastructure just because they are lazy. Imagine blockchain-based encrypted email. Very simple to write, with scalable blockchains it could be done in only 100 extra lines of code.\n\nScalability and also price volatility. Normal people do not want to be paid in volatile crazy tokens that can go up or down 2x in value before they have a chance to spend them.\n\nCT: In what application will the next generation Blockchain be used for?\n\nVB: In the longer term, I actually see blockchains and other decentralized technologies like distributed hash tables merging together into a kind of decentralized super-operating-system. Essentially, this dOS (not the same as microsoft\'s DOS) will be used not just for high-value stuff like payments but also as an infrastructure for very many kinds of web applications for perfectly mundane aspects of daily life. You could be conducting zero-knowledge privacy-preserving job searches on a blockchain of the future with a decentralized reputation system.

And I am not alone. Senior officials from the Government, Finance, Technology, Law Enforcement and Civil Society sectors are also getting on board because they see the endless possibilities and doors this groundbreaking innovation will open for millions of people around the world. From my former White House colleague Brian Forde who now heads the Digital Currency Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab, to the former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) — BitFury board member Jim Newsome — to the former Deputy Assistant Attorney General in charge of cybercrime and organized crime at the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division Jason Weinstein, to the former CFO of JP Morgan Blythe Masters, to startup entrepreneur Wences Casares. More and more respected experts from a diverse set of fields are leaving their respected positions to focus on the Blockchain.”\n\nThe former Senior Staffer step into the Blockchain technology sector is surely impressive, especially considering her career up to now, as stated in one of her blog posts:\n\n“Prior to working at Edelman, my career has included serving as Deputy White House Press Secretary and Special Assistant to President Obama, Director of Public Affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Director of Communications for the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and its then Chairman Senator Rockefeller, Traveling Press Director for Secretary Hillary Clinton’s 2008 Presidential campaign, and Director of Communications for Secretary Madeleine K. Albright and her consulting firm, The Albright Group, LLC.”\n\nEarly Internet Age Not Different From “Early Crypto Age”\n\nA comparison of early internet times to these “early cryptocurrency times” leaves no doubt about her excitement in her career switch:\n\n“We all remember the remarkable 1994 NBC Today Show interview with Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel when they famously asked live on air, “what is the internet?”\n\nBack then, very few fully understood the power of such an open and interoperable system.\n\nAnd now we live in a world where we stream movies through our iPhones that we searched for in a place called Google, all the while keeping in touch with our friends and family in a place called Facebook, while simultaneously buying holiday presents for our loved ones in a place called Amazon - all in the palm of our hands.”\n\nBetween news of presumed Ponzi schemes and governments considering tightening of Bitcoin regulations in relation to safety issues and terrorism, a story like this comes like a breath of fresh air.\n\nA person that worked at such a high level into the USA government is surely representing a powerful “lobbying” hand for the cause of Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology in the future, and another brick in the cryptocurrency reputation building.', 'Experts believe that the success tied to a recent spate of DDoS-for-hire groups may be because many are copycat collectives operating with a shorter lifespan.\n\nResearchers with Recorded Future, a Massachusetts-based firm that tracks real time threat intelligence, said Monday that they’ve noticed an increase in would-be hackers asking for guidance on forums when it comes to carrying out such attacks.\n\nIn particular, it has observed several requests on the dark web for instructions on how to perform DDoS attacks, set up Bitcoin wallets, and so forth. The frequency of the posts really picked up steam after publicity around the group DDoS 4 Bitcoin, according to Tyler Bradshaw, a solutions engineer with the firm.\n\nThe group DDoS 4 Bitcoin, or DD4BC, made headlines in mid-2014 and like most groups that deal in cyber extortion, warn victims they’ll be hit with a sizable DDoS attack, something around 400-500 Gbps, unless they pay a certain amount in Bitcoin.\n\nThe attackers usually harness a paid botnet to flood a victim’s site with traffic until they’re paid.\n\nResearch published in September by Akamai found the group carried out 141 attacks, albeit with a diminished average bandwidth of around 13 Gbps. After the report was issued, Recorded Future claims attacks “decreased sharply,” and that it seems the group has more or less went into hiding.\n\nBradshaw cites a few other examples, including a recent DDoS attack on encrypted email service ProtonMail. Officials at the service paid the group behind the hack, the fairly new The Armada Collective, a ransom, yet were still hit by a second, more intense attack that exceeded 100 Gbps.\n\nThe Armada Collective denied it was behind the second attack and even refunded Bitcoin to ProtonMail as a sign of solidarity, insisting “Somebody with great power, who wants ProtonMail dead, jumped in after our initial attack!” and “WE DO NOT HAVE THAT POWER! NOT EVEN CLOSE.” The comments suggest to Recorded Future that like DD4BC, the attackers don’t possess the ability to carry out high profile DDoS attacks and also fear getting caught.\n\nLast week, when three Greek banks were hit with a DDoS attack, the hackers purportedly represented The Armada Collective, but Bradshaw claims the amount of money the attackers asked for seemed uncharacteristic of the group.\n\nIn the past The Armada Collective have asked for anywhere between 10-200 BTC, or $3,600-$70,000, but attackers last week asked for 100 times that, 20,000 BTC, roughly $7.2 million.\n\n“This extremely high ransom, in combination with the messages sent back to ProtonMail, strongly suggests that somebody may be using the Armada Collective name in order to appear more legitimate,” Bradshaw wrote.', ""New Hampshire has been the most libertarian-leaning US state from the very founding of the nation. In January 1776, it became the first North American colony to establish a government that was independent of Great Britain's authority, and it has held onto its rebellious spirit ever since. More recently the Free State Project (FSP) chose to make the state their home, in 2003, and attracted liberty-minded individuals from around the world.\n\nAs a result, bitcoin usage over recent years has soared in the “live free or die” state, with events like the annual Porcfest primarily attracting bitcoin-accepting merchants.\n\nMany great bitcoin businesses call New Hampshire home, including the original bitcoin ATM company Lamassu. Erik Voorhees’ Satoshi Dice, the largest source of bitcoin traffic for many years, was there before it got shut down in the US.\n\nUnfortunately, New Hampshire statute 399-G:1, “Licensing of Money Transmitters,” was recently changed to add “virtual” currencies, commencing on January 1, 2016.\n\nThe old statute defined “Monetary value” simply as “a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in money.” The new version adds “convertible virtual currency” to the definition of monetary value, which makes a lot of difference for those that use it in a business setting.\n\n- New Hampshire General Court statute 399-G:1\n\nThe new rules define the term “Convertible virtual currency” as digital representation of value, that fulfills four criteria; It can be a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value; It has an equivalent value in real currency or acts as a substitute for real currency; It may be centralized or decentralized, and it can be exchanged for currency or other convertible virtual currency.\n\nThere are a few exemptions in the statute; Government agencies, and retailers issuing store value credit, or gift cards. Other than these exceptions, which typically do not apply to businesses that deal in bitcoin, the state's regulations are starting to look very similar to the federal regulations for digital currencies.\n\nFinCEN finalized its rules on the money transmission of virtual currency in 2013, although there have been little enforcement. The most high profile case resulted in a US$700,000 fine against Ripple labs earlier this year.\n\nAccording to a FinCEN ruling in August, there are three types of virtual currency activities. A virtual currency entity can either be an “exchanger,” an “administrator,” or a “user.”\n\nAn exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency.\n\nAn administrator is a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency.\n\nA user is a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services.\n\nUnder the FinCEN guidance, both exchangers and administrators are considered to be Money Transmitters, unless a limitation or exemption applies. The guidance does concede that an exchanger can act as either a broker or dealer, but both are considered money transmitters.\n\nAssuming that New Hampshire closely follows these federal definitions, this statute could affect everyone in New Hampshire that exchanges bitcoin in order to profit from the trade as a business. The bitcoin users most likely to be affected are selling on LocalBitcoins and Paxful. The business that run the platforms they use may well need to address compliance, along with any other bitcoin exchange that operates within the state.\n\nIt should be noted that this doesn’t make such activities illegal; It means that those affected need to register through the proper channels, and become an official Money Transmitter Business (MSB).\n\nUnfortunately, this is simply not an option for most. Becoming a legal MSB involves a time-consuming and difficult application process in New Hampshire, that includes recordkeeping and reporting procedures. There is, of course, a nonrefundable application fee of $500 for the principal office, and additional fees for each authorized delegate registration.\n\nAggravating these compliance woes is a prerequisite requiring registration with FinCEN. A copy of a filed Registration of Money Services Business, form 107, must accompany the State’s registration application, which won’t be issued without qualifying first.\n\nTo qualify as a money transmitter with FinCEN, a business must meet various requirements, such as having minimum capital of $50,000 to $1 million, with bonding, background checks on the executive staff, proof of holdings equal to 100% of consumer funds in “permissible investments,” regular reports, annual renewal filings, hiring a full-time compliance officer, and full audits on request.\n\nThen there are some more fees. FinCEN’s fees can be far higher than many startups can afford. Cumulatively, the fees for operating as a money transmitter in all 53 states and territories of the US total approximately $200,000, according to research conducted by Ashley Grimes, of Grimes Law PLLC. It typically takes upwards of 2 years to process these applications. A common complaint about this situation is that such a high barrier to entry serves to keep competition low for existing money transmission businesses.\n\nOne saving grace is that bitcoin miners will typically not be seen as transmitters by FinCEN.\n\n- FinCEN\n\nIt is a very fine line however, if miners turn around and sell their bitcoins for cash or other currencies, which most do, they will be classified as money transmitters again. Despite this, there have been no enforcements against bitcoin miners to date.\n\nIt seems quite counterintuitive to many that NH, of all states, could adopt this stance on bitcoin. One of the objectives of the Free State Project is to put libertarian-minded representatives in the state legislature, which writes these statutes. State representative Mark Warden is a Free State Project member.\n\n- The Free State Project\n\nAlthough it's not yet clear how much enforcement New Hampshire residents are likely to see, at least one thing is crystal clear: It will be interesting to watch what the states libertarians do in response."", 'Hace año y medio que la búsqueda de Satoshi Nakamoto parecía haber concluído.

12/09/2015,"['Australian Craig Wright could be the mysterious Bitcoin creator. But the same thing has been said about others before – the currency is bigger than one person\n\nCraig Wright, an Australian academic, might be the secret creator of cryptocurrency bitcoin, unmasked by an anonymous hacker after seven years in the shadows. Or he might be the target – maybe even the perpetrator – of one of the most meticulous hoaxes of the internet age.\n\nAnd yet, amazingly, whichever is true, the result is likely to have only the smallest effect on the future of bitcoin. The currency is now bigger than its creator, who hasn’t been openly involved since 2010, and decentralised governance is built into the very core of bitcoin, often to a fault.\n\nBut that hasn’t stopped the curiosity over who created the currency behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, a person (or group) with an estimated fortune of around £250m, from raging for years. If it is Wright, or Wright working in tandem with his late friend Dave Kleiman, then that mystery would be solved.\n\nBut almost as many questions would remain. Why amass a fortune which peaked at almost £750m and not touch a penny, as evidenced by the public record of transactions recorded on the currency’s ledger, the “blockchain”? Why drop off the face of the Earth in 2010 (save for one public statement in 2014 to deny being Dorian Nakamoto, named as the bitcoin founder by Newsweek)?\n\nAnd more questions would be raised by the documentation that led to the latest allegations: how could Wright have stayed secret for so long if he was willing to bandy Nakamoto’s name around to secure advantages in tax cases and political lobbying, as one email suggests? And why the bizarre pattern of deletions and repostings surrounding some of the public documents supporting the allegation? One blogpost was apparently published in 2009, deleted, and then reposted five years later; a mirror of it apparently hit Google in September 2015; and an encryption key linked to the post appears to have been created using a version of the software released in 2014, even as it was uploaded in 2008.\n\nThe public record around Nakamoto has always revealed little. The creator of bitcoin displayed unquestionable technical ability, combining a number of pre-existing innovations into a wholly new concept which, for the first time, offered the possibility of a truly decentralised, tradable, digitally native commodity: bitcoin. And they also left behind a fairly large corpus of writing, mostly technical in nature, resulting from their active participation in the discussion around bitcoin in the first year or two of its life.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, 64, who Newsweek identified as the founder of Bitcoin, talks with the media at his home in Temple City, California. Photograph: Zuma/Rex\n\nBut in terms of practical leads to the person or people behind the screen, there’s very little: no posts about their personal life, nothing linking the accounts they used to others on the net, no slips revealing little truths about their identity. Even passive information was curiously slim on the ground. Posts were made, and emails sent, at scattered times suggesting no link to any one time-zone; spellings would be British or American (Those confounding factors, of course, could now be explained by the claim that Satoshi was two people, one Australian and one American). Nakamoto appeared out of the ether, fully-formed, dropped Bitcoin on the world, and then disappeared almost as quickly.\n\nAs a result, we were left to try to piece together who might have created the currency from the barest clue: bitcoin itself. The innovations behind it could, many assumed, only have come from someone already active in the field of digital currency. Hence names like American computer scientist Nick Szabo and late coder Hal Finney (who was one of the first users of bitcoin) were often thrown into the mix – and always strenuously denied.\n\nFor Newsweek, there was one other clue: the name Nakamoto itself. In March 2014, reporter Leah McGrath Goodman identified a Japanese-American man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto as the real Satoshi, pointing to his history as an engineer and his libertarian politics. But Dorian Nakamoto’s confused denials seemed plausible enough, particularly after he referred to the currency as “bitcom”.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, it may not matter who is behind bitcoin. From day one, the currency has been the product of its users – literally. Anyone running a “mining” computer, burning processor cycles to verify transactions for the chance of a bitcoin windfall, has a say in how the network operates, and major changes can’t be made without the consent of at least half those miners.\n\nMajor figures in the currency have tried to force through their own changes before, and it hasn’t gone well. The community is too scattered, too idealistic, and too heterogenous to follow pronouncements from on high. And there’s little suggestion that that would change if Nakamoto comes in from the cold.\n\nIn the end, there’s one major effect that Nakamoto’s return could have: the liquidation, if they so desired, of more than 1m bitcoins, the largest single hoard in the currency’s existence. That would send exchanges into meltdown, turning the already volatile exchange rate into a rollercoaster.\n\nBut even that would die down, eventually. Bitcoin’s story is bigger than Satoshi Nakamoto, and it’s certainly bigger than Craig Wright.', 'Authorities are investigating Craig Wright, the man now believed to be bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, but the reasons behind the latest actions in Australia are murky.\n\nFollowing the publication of new evidence suggesting Australian businessman Craig S Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, law enforcement officials appear to be suddenly interested in Wright.\n\nPolice were quick to raid his home and office in Sydney, Australia, yesterday. The actions have so far ignited speculation as to why authorities are interested in Wright, and whether this has to do with his connection to the digital currency.\n\nSo far, the official line from authorities is that the events are unconnected.\n\nAccording to reports, authorities have attributed the action to an investigation by the Australian Tax Office (ATO), though the timing of the investigation into the matter, it\'s safe to say, appears suspicious.\n\nFor now, the agency is sharing few details. When reached for comment, ATO spokesperson John Hulin told CoinDesk:\n\n""Due to confidentiality provisions in the Tax Administration Act the ATO cannot comment on any individual\'s or entity\'s tax affairs.""\n\nThis doesn\'t mean that the community is without clues, however.\n\nDocumentation uncovered by WIRED, Gizmodo and Business Insider offers possible insight into to why the ATO is investigating Wright and whether their might be validity to the official claims by authorities.\n\nBad blood\n\nSo far, the most compelling resource offering insight into the matter is a liquidation document for Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence Pty Limited, a bitcoin firm Wright attempted to launch in 2013.\n\nAuthored by Hotwire\'s corporate advisory firm McGrathNicol, the document centers on issues between Hotwire and Australian tax authorities. As reported by Investor Daily, the dispute put a damper on Wright\'s business plans, which ultimately fizzled as Hotwire’s problems with the ATO worsened.\n\nWhere the blame lies in the incident is unclear from available evidence, and may hint at bad blood between Wright and the organization.\n\nMcGrathNicol attributes Hotwire\'s failure, in part, to the ATO, which it alleges did not send AU$3.4m in goods-and-services refunds owed to the company in a timely manner. Also cited were Wright\'s personal bitcoin losses due to the collapse of the now-defunct Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox,\n\nThe document also provides a timeline that details the dispute over the refund.\n\nElsewhere, Business Insider revealed McGrathNicol has inferred that the ATO put additional pressure on Wright and his business. An update to creditors dated 23rd November shows the ATO assessed a penalty of AU$1.7m to Hotwire because it did not believe the company had a claim to the AU$3.4m.\n\nThe matter is being considered by the ATO’s Private Groups & High Wealth Individuals division, according to the update.\n\nProblems between Wright and ATO continued after this dispute, however.\n\nBI further reported that Hotwire filed for a AU$5.5m tax return for 2014, an amount that the publication said has not yet been released to the company by the ATO.\n\nHotwire’s cash problems appear to be driven by the refund hold-up, and according to the creditor report, there is no indication as of last month as to when the funds will be released – if at all.\n\nAnother firm tied to Hotwire, Panopticrypt, appears to be in similar straits owing to ATO scrutiny, according to a November creditors update.\n\nFebruary meetings\n\nMore clues to the nature of the disputes can be found in a transcript outlining a meeting between Wright and ATO representatives on 18th February, 2014, and included in Gizmodo’s report.\n\nPresent at the meeting were Wright\'s accountant, John Chesher, and attorney Andrew Sommer, in addition to Wright himself. Representing the ATO were Dev McMaster, Marina Dolevksi and Hoa Doa.\n\nA subsequent meeting took place on 26th February, and included two representatives from the ATO, Chesher and Wright’s bookkeeper, Ann Wrightson. The minutes for the meeting were published by Gizmodo, though the ATO declined to confirm the veracity of the transcript and minutes to CoinDesk.\n\nIt is during the 18th February meeting meeting that Wright pushed for bitcoins to be classified as a kind of currency. As previously reported, it was then Wright claimed he had ""been running bitcoin since 2009"".\n\nIn one set of remarks attributed to Wright\'s attorney, it\'s suggested the push to have bitcoin deemed as a form of money for tax purposes would have implications for Hotwire and Wright\'s other ventures.\n\nIn another passage, Sommer went further in the push for the bitcoin-as-money classification. This part of the meeting also offers clues to the structuring of the claimed bitcoin holdings said to be primarily held outside of Australia – with the exception of a transaction involving Hotwire\'s Denariuz bitcoin bank project.\n\nAt one point, attorney Sommer refers to ""six different audits"" taking place against Wright\'s businesses. These firms include Coin Exchange, Cloudcroft, Strasan, Denariuz (the bitcoin-only bank) and Hotwire PE.\n\nIn the documents, Sommer outlined the nature of the dispute with the ATO as well as a series of events leading up to that meeting in February. In this segment, Sommer suggests that Wright has faced scrutiny from the tax agency as early as 2009.\n\nThe documents also show the ATO scrutinized whether bitcoins were actually paid out between Wright\'s entities – a line of inquiry that appears to have been complicated by the ATO\'s limited knowledge of the technology.\n\nNot only does the transcript illuminate the ATO’s query, but it offers clues to the degree of tension between the two sides.\n\nEarly in the discussion, Wright and Sommer pointed to an ATO decision made on 30th September that was never sent to them, despite apparent references in other correspondence.\n\nThe minutes also suggest Wright\'s troubles with the ATO appear to have been complicated due to a business association with Mark Ferrier, an Australian citizen who was arrested in 2013 for alleged fraud tied to a venture called MJF Mining Consulting.\n\nNotably, Wright’s reported bitcoin holdings were used to pay for a software transaction, a detail that could be relevant to the ATO as it suggests there is evidence supporting its investigations of his business use of bitcoin.\n\nPete Rizzo contributed reporting.\n\nTax confusion image via Shutterstock', 'The rise of bitcoin has central bankers around the world studying the possibility of issuing virtual money backed by the government itself.\n\nA shift in that direction could cut costs across the payment system and give authorities more control over their money supply. It also could\u200braise security and privacy concerns.\n\nTo date, no central...', 'About two weeks before his grisly death, there was a change in Dave Kleiman. The formerly generous and lively computer forensics expert became confrontational and bitter. Around that time, Kleiman left the Veteran’s Affairs hospital where he’d been a patient, and called his close friend and business partner Patrick Paige to let him know. “They’ve decided to release you? That’s great,” Paige remembers asking.\n\n“No,” Kleiman responded. “I told the doctors to go fuck themselves.”\n\nDave Kleiman was an Army veteran, a paraplegic, and a computing wizard occasionally consulted by national TV networks for his expertise in computer forensics and security. According to a monthlong Gizmodo investigation published yesterday, Kleiman may also have been deeply involved with Bitcoin. Documents and on-the-record interviews obtained by Gizmodo and Wired in separate investigations show that Craig Wright, an Australian CEO whose home and office were raided hours after the stories were published, repeatedly claimed in private that he and Kleiman were part of Bitcoin’s creation.\n\nIf that’s true, Kleiman seems to have refrained from accessing the very large sum that he would have presumably been entitled to as one of the currency’s architects. When he died, his Palm Beach County home was in foreclosure, and he never moved from the Miami VA Medical Center to a cushier hospital. Who was Dave Kleiman, and why in the world didn’t he cash out?\n\nKleiman was born in 1967, and, according to an obituary, was adopted by Louis and Regina Kleiman of Palm Beach Gardens sometime after that. (Regina Kleiman is deceased, and Louis, now 94, did not respond to repeated contact attempts.) He told friends that he’d been interested in computers and technology as a child. But even to Paige, who calls Kleiman his best friend, his early life was something of a mystery.\n\nIn 1986, Kleiman began serving in the U.S. Army as a helicopter technician. He returned home from the Army in 1990 and began working for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office several years later. His training officer was Patrick Paige, with whom he later founded a business called Computer Forensics, LLC, in 2012. The men were fast friends. Kleiman gave Paige his first computer, a DOS machine that required command-line input to operate, and would visit Paige at his home to help his daughter access games with it before the two went out on patrol.\n\n“Why the fuck do you do this job, with the knowledge you have?” Paige remembers asking of Kleiman while they worked. It was the early 1990s — the personal computer revolution was underway, and Kleiman’s talent could have yielded a much larger paycheck than what the sheriff’s office was offering. Kleiman always responded that it was his dream to work in law enforcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was the 1995 motorcycle accident, which left Kleiman physically handicapped and wheelchair-bound, and seemed to intensify his interest in computing. (It also didn’t seem to temper his joie de vivre: photos from after his paralysis show Kleiman skydiving with a wild grin on his face and two thumbs pointed defiantly into the air.) He briefly stayed on with the sheriff’s office, working in computer forensics, before leaving to pursue similar work as a freelancer in the private sector.\n\nOver the years, Kleiman’s reputation as a specialist grew. When he attended conferences, said Carter Conrad, the third partner in Computer Forensics, LLC, he was known as “Dave Mississippi” for the seemingly endless string of three-letter certifications that appeared after his name, which recall the singsong mnemonic device for spelling the state’s name. He appeared on CNN and ABC News and coauthored books about perfect passwords, security threats to businesses, and software arcana. As far as security went, Kleiman practiced what he preached: Paige and Conrad recall watching him type in 40- and 50-character passphrases to access his devices and files, and his home wireless network was so secure that Paige found it difficult to get work done while there. “Dude, I can’t load the page,” he said at his office this month, imitating his conversations with Kleiman. “I can’t run this script!”\n\nIn the early 2000s, Kleiman began contributing to computer security mailing lists such as those maintained by securityfocus.com and metzdowd.com, the latter of which was also used by Satoshi Nakamoto in the early days of Bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late 2010, a friend went to Kleiman’s home to check on him, and found that Kleiman had fallen in the shower and was unable to get up. That friend called fire rescue, and Kleiman was taken to a nearby hospital. For the rest of his life, because of sores that had become infected with MRSA, Kleiman would leave medical treatment centers only occasionally, usually to assist Conrad and Paige on a job. Otherwise, the pair would bring disks for examination on their regular visits to their friend, and he would plug away at them when he could. After surgeries, of which he had several, Kleiman was known to return to his computer immediately and begin working.\n\n\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto presented the framework behind Bitcoin in a paper submitted to the Metzdowd list in 2008, and the first iteration of its software in 2009. If Dave Kleiman truly helped create it, the work would have happened before his hospitalization and the creation of Computer Forensics, LLC, when he was working as an independent contractor. An email provided to Gizmodo seems to show Wright asking Kleiman for help with the paper just months before it was published. “I need your help editing a paper I am going to release later this year. I have been working on a new form of electronic money. Bit cash, Bitcoin...” it reads. “You are always there for me Dave. I want you to be a part of it all.”\n\nConrad is more skeptical than Paige that their partner was one of the minds behind the internet’s greatest mystery, but both men are adamant that he had the skills to pull it off and the discretion that would have been needed to keep it a secret. The descriptor that Conrad used most frequently in our conversations about Kleiman was “compartmentalized”: he kept the separate parts of his life separate, and if you weren’t already in on his business, he wouldn’t be likely to tell you about it. The descriptor that Paige used most frequently was “genius.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKleiman’s exit from the Miami VA hospital in 2013 marked the beginning of what Paige refers to as his “unabomber period.” He holed up in his home and refused most contact from outsiders, including formerly close friends. He was profoundly physically unwell. At one point, he told Paige that he was shivering, fighting off a fever, but would continue to work through it. On another occasion, he said he would call the police if Paige continued calling to check up on him.\n\nLess than a month later, Dave Kleiman was found dead in his home. According to reports provided by the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner Office, the scene of Kleiman’s death was gruesome. His body was decomposing, there were wheelchair tracks of blood and fecal matter, open bottles of alcohol, and a loaded handgun next to him. A bullet hole in his mattress would seem to suggest suicide or foul play, but no ammunition casings were found, meaning he might have fired his gun and cleaned up sometime before dying. The official cause of death is listed as natural, and Conrad remembers hearing that the MRSA had stopped Kleiman’s heart.\n\nThe squalor surrounding their partner’s death and final days is the biggest sticking point for both Paige and Conrad about the idea that Kleiman was involved with Bitcoin. Though he never asked for money, both men regularly wrote Kleiman checks in hopes of keeping him afloat after his conditioned worsened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe documents provided to Gizmodo include what appears to be an unfinished draft of a trust contract showing Wright entrusting Kleiman with 1.1 million bitcoins in 2011. It’s a sum worth hundreds of millions of dollars, but according to the contract, the money was to be returned to Wright down the road. Kleiman’s sense of honor may have kept him from accessing money that he didn’t believe was truly his, even in the direst of circumstances, Conrad said.\n\nWhile he was alive, Kleiman kept a heavy-duty USB drive on his person at all times. Paige believes it might have been made by the brand Corsair — which boasts that its products are encased in “an anodized aircraft-grade aluminum housing.” If he really did possess a Satoshi Nakamoto-level fortune, it may have been sitting on that drive.\n\nAccording to Paige, that drive was passed to Kleiman’s brother Ira, who declined to speak on the record about whether he possessed it. But even if the bitcoins were there, recovering them wouldn’t be nearly as simple as pulling files from an ordinary USB drive. Kleiman, the consummate security buff, locked down everything he owned with encryption strong enough that even his tech-savvy partners doubt they’d be able to crack it. “If you told me there was a million dollars on Dave’s computer in this room, I wouldn’t even bother trying to look for it,” Paige said. “It would be a waste of time.”', 'North Carolina has carved out regulatory exemptions for select bitcoin and blockchain businesses in a move industry supporters say avoids problematic provisions in place in other US states.\n\nIn a substantial update to its money transmitter FAQ page, the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks (NCCOB) has exempted digital currency miners; non-financial blockchain services; and multi-signature and non-custodial wallet providers from the state\'s Money Transmitters Act (MTA).\n\nNotably, the exemptions are the result of collaboration between the NCCOB and industry advocacy group the Chamber of Digital Commerce, which worked with law firm BuckleySandler LLP and government relations consulting firm Gide on the initiative.\n\nThe NCCOB had previously supported a legislative bill that would have covered bitcoin and digital currency related business activities.\n\nAs noted by the CDC and its partners, the decision by North Carolina to instead collaborate directly with industry stakeholders contrasts with efforts like New York’s state-specific licensing regime, the BitLicense, which was enacted earlier this year.\n\nBuckleySandler counsel Amy Kim said in a statement:\n\n""These FAQs are quite remarkable as they define specific activities as falling outside the scope of the regulation, which very well may serve as a template for other state interpretations.""\n\nIn addition to the exemptions, the agency specified that digital currency transmission is regulated under the MTA, as are virtual currency ""exchangers and administrators"" depending on their business model.\n\n""An exchanger that sells its own stock of virtual currency is generally not considered a virtual currency transmitter under the NC MTA. In contrast, an exchanger that holds customer funds while arranging a satisfactory buy/sell order with a third party, and transmits virtual currency and fiat currency between buyer and seller, will typically be considered a virtual currency transmitter,"" the FAQ page reads.\n\nNorth Carolina further clarified that it does not require a special license for digital currency businesses operating in state, noting that it ""applies the same standard” to these entities as money transmitters operating with fiat currencies.\n\nOverall, the changes mark one of the most sizeable updates to the agency’s FAQ page, and provide new clarity to industry businesses seeking to reach customers in the ninth most populous US state.\n\nAccording to bitcoin advocacy group Coin Center, North Carolina law had previously only exempted authorized agents of businesses that had obtained a money transmitter license.\n\nNorth Carolina capitol image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

These currencies can be bought or sold through virtual currency exchanges, and they can be used to purchase goods or services from businesses that accept them.”\n\nInvestors purchase virtual currency with the expectation that it will sell for a higher price in the future. These investments can be extremely risky because virtual currency exchange rates often fluctuate dramatically and unpredictably. The value of a single Bitcoin passed the $1,000 mark in November 2013, but settled down to the $200 range by early 2015. The current Bitcoin exchange is about $407 USD.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nVirtual currency is relatively unregulated, unsecured and susceptible to cyberattacks.\n\nVirtual currency accounts are not protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insures bank and credit union deposits.\n\nVirtual currency is volatile and investments may be unsuitable for most investors.\n\nMany businesses that accept virtual currency are unregulated, increasing the risk of fraud and theft than.\n\nSome virtual currency exchanges have been used for illegal activity such as drug dealing and money laundering. If law enforcement shuts down or restricts the use of an exchange, it will affect other consumers and investors.\n\nVirtual currency is considered by the IRS to be a form of property and must be reported as such on federal taxes.\n\nIf you believe you may have been the victim of a scam or fraud, you can contact the Commerce Department’s Consumer Services Center by email at consumer.protection@state.mn.us or by phone at 651-539-1600 or 800-657-3602.', 'Kevin Owocki woke up at 4am this morning with an idea. When someone visits a news site and their web browser uses an ad blocker, he thought, what if the site replaced ads with an invitation to donate a fraction of a bitcoin? Even in blocking its ads, readers could instantly contribute to the site’s well-being. They could pay, albeit a very small amount, for the stories they want to read.\n\n“You read all the time about how publishers are having trouble migrating their business model to the 21st century,” says Owocki, a software developer in Colorado. “It just seems like micropayments is where that should go.”\n\nEven in blocking its ads, readers could instantly contribute to the site’s well-being. They could pay for the stories they want to read.\n\nSo, at 4 am, Owocki built a tool that makes this possible and threw it onto GitHub. By mid morning, the tool—AdBlock-to-Bitcoin—was a popular topic at Hacker News, a major online hangout for software engineers. “Personally, I think bitcoin is the move,” said one commenter. “The long-term deflationary nature, the hivemind of sage engineers swarming around scalability, with the end-goal being tiny machine-to machine-payments, and the precision of value that you can achieve make it perfect.” In other words, he liked the idea.\n\nThis isn’t something that will appear on news sites and online magazines tomorrow. But it’s designed to prompt conversation about the possibility of funding online publishers via micropayments. In that sense, it’s already working. In fact, it’s stirring up similar ideas publishers and engineers have offered in recent years—and in recent weeks—in an effort to mitigate the influence of ad blocking. Developers have built similar tipping services for publishers. And early this fall, the bitcoin outfit Coinbase proposed a browser that would let people pay small amounts of bitcoin for almost anything.\n\nMainstreaming Micropayments\n\nUsing micropayments to fund publishers is an old idea that’s never really caught on. But various tech trends are converging toward a point where such a thing finally seems viable—due in large part to bitcoin, a digital currency readily broken into tiny pieces. The rub is that bitcoin, though it continues to mature, has not reached widespread acceptance. “If your real objective is to get actually some income in place of the ad, I would highly suggest supporting traditional forms of payment in addition to bitcoin,” another Hacker News denizen said in response to AdBlock-to-Bitcoin. “Although Bitcoin is interesting/cool/worthy of existence, 99.9 percent of users don’t have a Bitcoin wallet, so you’ll be missing out on a lot of potential income.”\n\nTo make bitcoin donations via a tool like Adblock-to-Bitcoin, you need a bitcoin wallet, which is a service that lets you store, send, and receive bitcoin. And Owocki acknowledges that the number of people with such a thing is limited. But he says his tool can work with other payment methods. Make it easy enough for people to make small payments, he believes, and such a tool can underpin a viable business model for publishers. As it stands, the tool generates a QR code readers use to make a bitcoin donation. It suggests a donation size. And it can track how many people actually respond to these donation invitations—and how they respond.\n\nThe idea still certainly a rough draft. But Owocki’s project shows how easily coders and developers can bring new ideas to the masses and refine them. Owocki built his prototype in about two hours, leaning on bitcoin and an existing open source tool called FuckAdBlock, which detects when someone is using an ad blocker. And thanks to Github, the Internet’s central repository for open source software, he could distribute the code even faster. As new ideas and new suggestions arrive, they can almost instantly come to fruition. The future of publishing may be closer than you think.', 'Craig Steven Wright is the most-wanted Australian on the planet right now, after tax authorities raided his home and two reports named him as the likely inventor of Bitcoin.\n\nHe also has a weird theory that the tulip mania that gripped the Netherlands in the 1600s was not actually a bubble, as commonly understood.\n\nCurrently, no one knows where he is. Wright has taken his blog, his Linkedin and his YouTube accounts offline.\n\nHe told a Bitcoin conference in November that he was about to travel to London or Iceland, two locations where he has previously lived and studied.\n\nIn that conference, where he appeared on a panel via Skype, he was asked about the computers he runs. Wright said he was based ""in I celand because of power. It\'s much, much cheaper in Iceland to run supercomputers"" and that the computer he was building was ""No. 15 in the top 500 supercomputers globally."" (The cost of mining Bitcoin is determined largely by the amount of electricity you need to do the computer processing, and that cost is vastly reduced if you don\'t need to keep the machines cool — so Bitcoin miners prefer cold climates for their computers. Iceland also has really cheap electricity.)\n\n""We\'ve been modeling Bitcoin scalability for a number of years now,"" he said. It wasn\'t clear what he meant by that, but he seemed to be trying to avoid describing directly what he was actually doing. One theory about Wright is that he is in possession of a Bitcoin trove worth $60 million.\n\nThe name of his Iceland computer is ""Tulip,"" Wright said.\n\nWhen asked why he named the machine Tulip, he said that the name was a reference to the ""tulip mania"" bubble that afflicted the Netherlands in 1637. In the tulip bubble, Holland\'s tulip bulbs suddenly rose in price as people traded them. Bulbs briefly became more valuable than a year\'s income for some workers. Prices collapsed again suddenly, wiping out several fortunes. The episode is generally regarded as the first classic case of an economic bubble bursting, and is a frequent reference when people talk about rapid price rises in otherwise shaky economic assets.\n\nBitcoin price rises — a tradeable currency that is not backed by any asset whatsoever, except itself — is frequently compared to the tulip bubble.\n\nWright told this story:\n\n""Most people don\'t actually realise that the tulip bubble wasn\'t really a bubble. It was actually a reallocation of contracts, it was made from a contract to a \'swaption,\' by changing the contract to a swaption effectively, and by allowing government officials to get out of a contract they collapsed the price.""\n\n""Now tulips did actually have a use back then. Tulips kill grass and one of the things they would have done was plant them around castles to keep the grass down and trees down, because they\'re toxic. If you had a castle back then you wanted a large area to see things. There was actually quite a value in tulips because, they sold billions of them around Europe. ... The volumes were huge. The audience was huge, it was bigger than coffee is now.""\n\nNeedless to say, most people understand the tulip bubble as a period in which prices rose because they became unlinked from the underlying value of tulips. It is true, however, that the bubble ended in part when the Dutch government converted futures contracts on tulip contracts into options on tulip futures. That gave buyers an easy way to get out of an agreement to buy, and vastly reduced the value of any contract.\n\nBut the bottom line for observers is, arguably, this: The guy who invented Bitcoin doesn\'t think the tulip bubble was a bubble.', ""PayBis exchange lets users exchange a range of e-currencies, including the option to purchase Bitcoins using Paypal. The team is planning to broaden the company and raise funds to proceed with their roadmap.\n\nLaunched in March 2015, PayBis is still a relatively small exchange company that prides itself on reliability. Even though the number of transactions amount to just over 5000 (to December 2015), the website already has1500 registered users, and boasts that is has a number of “aficionados” from previous exchange platforms. These so called “aficionados” are unrelated to the actual company, but were brought on by the founders:\n\n“We have a public reputation, which we care about greatly. Our customers feedback on Localbitcoins, Paxful, Facebook and our website is important to us. Thus many customers find us based on public and open feedback and it's a big difference to trust a website run by well known traders comparing to some other websites on the web.”\n\nKonstantin Vasilenko, PayBis COO, explains the company’s edge over it’s competitors:\n\n“The main differences we have from our competition (other online digital currency exchanges and classical BTC exchanges) is that we offer fully managed and guided services to our customers. Similar to a Peer-2-Peer marketplace, we help and guide our customers when purchasing Bitcoin using the most convenient payment method available in their country.”\n\nIt’s worth to note that this exchange is one of the few that allows users to buy Bitcoins using Paypal: “Now we are one of the few companies who accept PayPal. Which is a big advantage for customers, but a pain for us. But so far we are handling fraudsters pretty well, with less than 1% of cases.”\n\nHowever the commission to buy Bitcoins using Paypal looks a little on the expensive side. It’s hovering at 17.6% at the moment of writing, but there seems to be a good return in trust.\n\nOne thing they are proud of at PayBis is their hand-in-hand helpdesk that follows clients throughout the entire buying process: “The assistant doesn’t only help the customer by answering all their questions, but also guides them in making the purchase itself. This way, the better the agent performs, the happier is the customer and more of them are likely to return.”\n\nThat looks like a good strategy, if you ask me.\n\nWord To The Experts\n\nBut our expert on this type of matter Simon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com and Fund Manager at Bitcoin Capital, seems concerned by what represents one of the power points of PayBis: the option to buy Bitcoins using Paypal.\n\n“We have many applications for finance from new exchanges at BnkToTheFuture.com and very few get through. As part of our due diligence process we look for a banking relationship where the bank knows what they do. Unless a banking partnership is not needed (such as one of our portfolio companies ShapeShift), proof that they are segregating funds so client money is not mixed with operational accounts s required. If they make claims like they accept PayPal then we are certain that PayPal does not know what they are doing yet and the account will be taken away as soon as they scale. We are always supportive of new ways of exchanging funds from the traditional financial sector, but the biggest barrier to starting an exchange will always be trust. With trust comes liquidity and more payment options.”\n\nJure Pirc, President of Bitcoin Association Slovenia, is more concerned with company information, or lack of it:\n\n“The website is quite clear on the exchange pairs and associated fees. However, I was unable to locate any company related information on the site which suggests to me that the operators are not registered with any financial regulators. If they are, they should declare it. This would work for them as positive advertising, and provide some confidence for potential clients, because they would know they are reliable.”\n\n“Having an online exchange that offers Bitcoin-Paypal and vice versa for sure is uncommon in the Bitcoin world so I can only speculate that Paypal isn’t aware of the nature of the business that the account is used for.” said Jure Pirc. “I was planning to sign up for the service just to do a quick BTC to Paypal exchange but I stopped at the point when I selected to signup via Google Auth, where the system requested to manage my google contacts, besides my email and basic profile info. Why would they even want to have that permission in the first place? After that, I also noticed that the domain’s Whois registration info is protected and when I added that to the fact that there is no info on the company that operates the exchange, I decided not to finish my registration..\n\nJure Pirc then concluded:\n\n“Last but not least, after reading this page. I found myself asking since when is it a Paypal requirement to have a handwritten note for anything (at least my personal and company Paypal account never had the need to physically sign anything). At this point I don’t see myself recommending this service to people in my social circles and I don’t even want to comment on the 17,6% fee that is listed for Paypal to Bitcoin exchanges.”\n\nIn the end, it seems that PayBis still needs to build up a good reputation and better expose their company data. After all, everybody wants to know in whose hands their money is going through. We’ll see in the next months how the company will move in regard to its development and transparency.\n\nEditor’s Note\n\nCoinTelegraph received an email from PayBis executive Innokenty Isers, CEO of PayBis, highlighting issues with the opinions expressed by the opinionists in the article.\n\nInnokenty states that the Business model reviewed by Paypal Merchant team is fully approved, and full legal company information is located at the footer of the home page. Regarding the 17.6% fee, Innokenty claims this is probably the lowest fee that can be found for Paypal To Bitcoin exchanges, and in regard to the website address privacy protection he states that this is going to change soon, and the request to manage contacts via Google Auth will be fixed as soon as possible."", 'Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin’s price could be in for more gains, as technical indicators on the short-term time frames are hinting at a pickup in bullish pressure.\n\nA steeper trend line can be drawn to connect the latest lows of Bitcoin price action on the 1-hour chart, and a quick bounce took place on the latest test.\n\nBitcoin price might be aiming for the yearly highs around $500 since it broke above another consolidation pattern as expected.\n\nBullish Divergence Materializing\n\nThe stochastic oscillator has formed lower lows from the start of the month to yesterday while Bitcoin prices made higher lows, adding confirmation that buyers are gaining control of the game.

12/10/2015,"[""Who is the man behind bitcoin? It's a question that's puzzled the cybersphere ever since the virtual currency was created in 2009. But tech magazine Wired now claims to have solved the riddle, naming its creator as Australian entrepreneur and academic Craig Steven Wright. (Reuters)\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, separately and within two hours of each other, two well-known tech websites suggested that they’d solved a mystery that had eluded the online world for more than half a decade.\n\nThey’d found “Satoshi Nakamoto,” the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.\n\nHe was an Australian named Craig Steven Wright, a 44-year-old former academic “nobody,” as Wired put it. Wright had never before appeared on the public lists of any Nakamoto-hunters and yet troves of leaked (or perhaps hacked) documents published by both Wired and the tech blog Gizmodo seemed to point to him.\n\nWithin hours of the two stories’ publication, Wright’s online presence had all but vanished, Gizmodo reported, and Australian authorities were raiding Wright’s suburban Sydney home.\n\nIn a statement to the Associated Press, Australian Federal Police said the searches were related to a tax investigation, not the recent articles linking Wright to Bitcoin\n\nBut the media reports and subsequent raid have thrown the virtual currency and its inscrutable founder back in the spotlight. And if the events of the past two days seem oddly timed, they’re hardly more bizarre than any that have occurred in the lengthy hunt for “Nakamoto” since Bitcoin launched seven years ago.\n\nThe open source software for Bitcoin, which allows users to make online transactions anonymously and without going through banks or other financial institutions, was released in 2009. It started out more resembling monopoly money than real currency — people would trade the “coins” (really just lines of code) for favors or even give them away. But as the exotic system gained popularity, it gained value.\n\nNow anyone — tech nerds, central bank-averse Libertarians, criminals — can use bitcoins for anything from ordering pizza to trafficking drugs. Their value fluctuates wildly, but at the moment one is worth about $415, according to the AP.\n\nBut as the currency became a financial force unto itself, its creator — a person or group of people calling themselves “Satoshi Nakamoto,” though there are no known coders who go by that name — remained enigmatic.\n\n“Back then, it was not clear that creating Bitcoin might be a legal thing to do,” Bitcoin’s chief scientist, Gavin Andresen, told Newsweek last year. “[Nakamoto] went to great lengths to protect his anonymity.”\n\nThen, in 2011, with a message to a developer that read simply, “I’ve moved on to other things,” Nakamoto disappeared, leaving fans of the currency and nosy tech journalists with few clues as to his, her or their true identity.\n\nA bitcoin logo is displayed at the Inside Bitcoins conference and trade show, Monday, April 7, 2014 in New York. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)\n\nHere’s what we do know:\n\nIn his initial writings about Bitcoin, Nakamoto claimed to be a 36-year-old from Japan who had been driven by anger about the 2008 financial crisis to try and invent an alternative. But many Nakamoto-hunters believe their man (or woman) is a native English speaker: the person who blogged about Bitcoin extensively before signing off in 2011 wrote in flawless English and tended to use British spellings — “colour,” “grey” — once described something as “bloody hard” and embedded a reference to the Times of London into the “genesis” lines of code that got the currency started, according to the New Yorker.\n\nIn 2011 Stefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active member of the Bitcoin community, graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto’s 500-plus bitcoin forum posts. He found, according to Wired, that Nakamoto was rarely writing between 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time (midnight to 6 a.m. Eastern Standard Times), even on Saturdays and Sundays. Perhaps the elusive currency creator was an East Coaster who slept during those hours?\n\nBut those hints are largely circumstantial. The potentially biggest clue is a million-coin trove stored behind an encrypted signature known as a PGP key. The stash is plainly visible in public record of all bitcoin transactions called the “block chain” and is widely thought to belong to Nakamoto, according to Wired.\n\nSomeone moving coins from that trove would offer the best confirmation that they were the real Nakamoto. But the release of $400 million worth of bitcoins would also likely destabilize the currency and throw the online financial world into chaos.\n\nSo far, the stash remains untouched.\n\nIt is with this scant evidence that Nakamoto hunters go seeking their elusive target — so far, with little luck. Writing in the New Yorker in 2011, Joshua Davis floated the idea that Irish cryptography student Michael Clear might be responsible for Bitcoin; he emphatically denied it.\n\n“I’m not Satoshi,” Clear told Davis. “But even if I was I wouldn’t tell you.”\n\nLater that year, Fast Company ran its own investigation, searching the web for key phrases pulled from Nakamoto’s initial Bitcoin paper, based on the logic that writers tend to repeat favorite phrases. That brought up a patent for an encrypted communication system. But when the reporter contacted the three men who filed the patent, they too denied any involvement. One said he had to look “Bitcoin” up on Wikipedia to figure out what it was.\n\nOther suspects include: Andresen, a prominent developer for Bitcoin and the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, “the closest thing to a central authority in the world of Bitcoin,” in the words of the MIT Tech Review; Shinichi Mochizuki, a brilliant Japanese American mathematician who once solved one of the world’s hardest math problems, quietly posted his solution on the Internet, and walked away; Jed McCaleb, who started the world’s largest bitcoin exchange; and Nick Szabo, a cryptographer and legal scholar who had been working on digital currency for more than a decade before Bitcoin was launched.\n\nThen there’s Hal Finney, the first person to actually use Bitcoin — aside, of course, from Nakamoto himself. A reporter for Forbes had a language analysis firm compare Finney’s writing to the creator’s fluid blog posts, and found a surprising degree of similarity. What’s more, Finney had talked about the idea of a digital currency on email lists as far back as the early ’90s, and he helped develop PGP — the encryption program that protects, among millions of other files, Nakamoto’s million-bitcoin stash.\n\nBut Finney responded to Forbes’ questions the way they all did.\n\n“I’m flattered but I deny categorically these allegations,” he wrote in an email. “I don’t know what more I can say.”\n\nThe splashiest — and most disastrous — declaration of Nakamoto’s true identity came last year, when Newsweek ran a cover story titled “The Face Behind Bitcoin.”\n\nThe true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, reporter Leah McGrath Goodman wrote, was a 64-year-old Californian named Satoshi Nakamoto, though he now went by Dorian. He was trained as a physicist and a veteran of a long career in engineering and military related projects, plus he had the libertarian bent that characterizes so many Bitcoin admirers. In a confrontation with Goodman in front of his home and two Temple City, Calif. police officers (who confirmed the quote), he seemed to tacitly acknowledge his involvement.\n\n“I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,” he said “It’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.”\n\nBut after Newsweek’s story ran and reporters began clamoring for interviews — resulting in a car chase through the streets of Los Angeles — he quickly reached back out to the magazine with a statement via his lawyer: Dorian Nakamoto had nothing to do with Bitcoin, he thought that Goodman was referring to his military projects, he wanted all this attention to go away.\n\nJust after that, a statement appeared from the “real” Satoshi Nakamoto’s in an Bitcoin forum: “I am not Dorian Nakamoto.”\n\nThere was a bit of a lull in purported Nakamoto-outings after the dust settled from the Newsweek debacle. If anything, the incident seemed to illustrate just how perilous any claims to have found the elusive creator can be — after all, it really did seem like Dorian Nakamoto had admitted to being involved.\n\nBut Wired and Gizmodo seem to believe the evidence that Wright and his friend American computer forensics analyst David Kleiman, who died in 2013, are behind Bitcoin was worth taking a risk for.\n\nTheir assertion relies mostly on documents leaked by people close to Wright, including a transcript from a conversation between Wright, his attorney and the Australian Taxation Office in which Wright says, “I did my best to try and hide the fact that I’ve been running bitcoin since 2009. By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.”\n\nIt’s not clear whether the same person leaked the documents to both Wired and Gizmodo — some details of their reports differ. Wired also uncovered a liquidation report on a company Wright owned that showed he’d invested several millions of dollars in bitcoins in the company — “a strangely large stash for an unknown player in the bitcoin world,” Wired said.\n\nWright did not respond to requests for comment from either site.\n\nBoth reports acknowledge that the leaked documents could be a hoax, particularly Wired.\n\n“But this much is clear,” Wired reported. “If Wright is seeking to fake his Nakamoto connection, his hoax would be practically as ambitious as bitcoin itself.”\n\nOther tech sites have already thrown some cold water on Wired and Gizmodo’s reveals (Motherboard, for example, wrote a lengthy analysis of disparities in PGP codes, about 20 percent of which is intelligible to the lay Bitcoin observer).\n\nBut the fact remains that people desperately want to know who Nakamoto is. Bitcoin is currently dealing with a dispute about how currency is created, and some would like Nakamoto re-emerge to intervene, according to the AP. There’s also the matter of the PGP-protected stash of $400 million in bitcoin that could totally alter the market.\n\nAnd then there’s the fact that so many Bitcoin users are computer scientists and cryptographers, people who have built worlds online and delight in deconstructing others’.\n\nNakamoto is yet another cipher. Just begging to be solved."", ""Litecoin\n\nOn the 12-hour chart of Litecoin we see that yesterday there was the fifth reach to the top of $3.80 in two weeks, which happened due to a sharp growth of Bitcoin again. However, Litecoin went higher than $3.50 and then moved down to the same level of $3.20.\n\nThis time, while the Bitcoin price grows, the LTC/BTC pair fell, having reached an 0.085 exchange rate. While miners don't believe in Litecoin prospects, this cryptocurrency has no prospects for steady growth.\n\nDASH\n\nAfter a sharp exit yesterday, with rates 0.057 to 0.066, DASH got into a correction, and traders again put orders on 0.056. It’s quite possible that DASH will grow again — for example, while Bitcoin faces a continuation of price corrections.\n\nDogecoin\n\nYesterday Dogecoin also showed some of the cryptocurrency market's general revival. The sharp shot from 29 to 35 Satoshi occurred with the sharp growth of trade volumes, which for the first time for long period exceeded 100 BTC per day (and that is data from the Poloniex exchange only). Now there was a kickback to 33 Satoshi, but nevertheless, growth of 10% in a day is impressive. According to that, purchases lower than 30 Satoshi are favorable.\n\nETH\n\nETH for the first time in a long period showed a careful growth due to the numerous orders to buy located near a local bottom (0.016-0.018). Thus, we’re still within a downtrend. There is a probability that this tendency will change but it is impossible to tell that this steady growth will begin any time soon..\n\nPeercoin\n\nYesterday Peercoin almost reached $0.44 but only because of the continuing growth of Bitcoin. On the two-hour chart we can see something like an uptrend but it is deceptive — as we will see the price of $0.40 and below not once. The PPC/BTC pair moves lower than 0.001,while trade volumes grow. The structure of an orderbook on buy orders changed and the price corridor moved to 0.0008 — 0.00075.\n\nNeucoin\n\nNeucoin jumped sharply from the level of $7.63 for 1000 Neu to the level of $9 and above. Thus good potential for movement up and development remains.\n\nDid you know that you can compare altcoins in our top of cryptocurrencies and help our readers to choose the best one?

The bitcoin ecosystem now includes a number of financial intermediaries, like wallet providers and exchanges, and these show a trend towards concentration.""\n\nOverall, the report seeks to examine the role of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledgers in the broader shift toward real-time payments, with Mai stating that the emerging technology offers a ""novel"" design proposal for such a system.\n\n""Although still in its infancy, blockchain technology might revolutionise the financial industry which is characterised by tiered, centralised networks in many markets,"" the report reads.\n\nElsewhere, the report analyzes how different closed- and open-loop payment systems can achieve real-time global payments, offering an outlook for how it believes each can achieve this larger goal.\n\nThe findings suggest that Deutsche Bank, which joined the R3 distributed ledger consortium this September, is optimistic about the potential of decentralized cryptographic technologies, even if their future outlook isn\'t certain:\n\n""Given the early stage of development, it is still unclear if blockchain technology is suited to underpinning significant instant retail payment traffic in the future.""\n\nInstant processing\n\nNotably, cryptographic ledger systems, the paper states, have to some extent already succeeded in bringing real-time payments to a relatively small market.\n\nThe report notes that while bitcoin transactions can take 10 minutes to confirm, consensus systems such as the permissioned Ripple protocol offer transfers ""within seconds"". Still, the biggest open question toward the use of these systems, the author reasons, is that the technology has only been tested on a small scale to date.\n\nShould the scale of these networks be increased, Mai also speculates that new pressures may reshape how public blockchains like bitcoin operate.\n\n""Sceptics expect that distributed (ie decentralised) payment systems will not be able to compete with centralised transfer systems on cost, unless they concentrate processing in fewer miners,"" he writes.\n\nIn addition, Mai says that blockchain systems still face many unanswered legal questions, such as how laws can be enforced in such networks without centralizing agents.\n\nRead the full research report below:\n\nInstant Revolution of Payments?\n\nDeutsche Bank image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The bank plans to join the international consortium R3 and develop blockchain based services. However, as in the case of other international big banks, it doesn\'t plan to use Bitcoin.\n\n“We cooperate with the consortium very closely and watch the direction of blockchain technology. We are studying the documentation and I can\'t rule out that we will enter. though there\'s no final decision yet,” said Lev Khasis, the bank’s deputy chairman for Russian daily Kommersant.\n\nAccording to L. Khasis, although blockchain is the building base for Bitcoin payment network, Sberbank doesn\'t plan to use it. „As far as I know, the regulator\'s negative position haven\'t changed. blockchain, however, could be used for our internal settlements, transactions between our subsidiaries and other banks. It has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, it\'s just another accountant method: simple, fast and reliable.“\n\n""Another bank joining R3 does not excite me at all and it is irrelevant to consumers too. Banks will use the blockchain to save money in the back end with no saving or impact to the end consumer. It helps their bottom line. It may be faster, but it won\'t be more secure as they are missing out the most important part that makes a blockchain secure - a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin,“ Simon Dixon, CEO BnkToTheFuture.com and Fund Manager of Bitcoin Capital told to CT.\n\n“Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain, as it rewards its miners (auditors) with newly created Bitcoin. Without external miners (auditors) being incentivized to verify transaction there is little security improvement. We are more passionate about investing in technology that makes banks less significant, than blockchains that make it cheaper for banks to commit more crime as they are not using the most secure and transparent blockchain - Bitcoin. The Russian regulators will realize this eventually, but in the meantime Bitcoin works without banks.""\n\nAccording to S. Dixon “allowing the blockchain and banning Bitcoin is like allowing people to sell food but making it illegal to eat it. Firstly, it\'s not going to work and drive Bitcoin in Russia to a very buoyant and active black market and secondly, privatised blockchains without the global network of auditors making sure it is not rigged is not much of an improvement on the existing financial solutions. It sounds like a government trying to sound hip by using the word blockchain like all the banks are today, but getting it very wrong by ignoring the real innovation called Bitcoin.”\n\n“The stated objective of R3 and the banks joining the initiative are ‘to collaborate on research, design, and engineering that will advance innovative solutions for clients that meet banking requirements for security, reliability, performance, scalability, and auditing.’ I am sure that does not necessarily exclude applications around digital currencies and a raft of applications that are emerging around blockchain adoption. Yes, some banks might just use the platform to adopt Bitcoin, but in a way that is transparent and compliant. I like to think of the blockchain as ‘middleware’, to mention an old IT term, around which a number of applications can be spun, not least that being of interbank and corresponding bank settlements, payment processing and remittances. One would like to think that banks will pass the benefits on to their consumers, those are the natural laws of competition, which we are already seeing in the fintech and alt finance spaces rising up to challenge or complement traditional banking and financial service offerings in developed and emerging markets,” thinks Manie Eagar, co-founder and chairman of the DiGiFIn and director of Bitcoin Alliance of Canada.\n\n“The representatives of the big banks and financial institutions that are working on blockchain technologies are just people like you. They are Bitcoiners, crypto-fanatics. But they can\'t sell it to their supervisors, or the people in charge. Instead, they wrapped it up into something different. They know that this is what they are talking about. The people in charge don\'t quite yet appreciate that but once they fall in love with things we all fall in love with, they are going to realize that it\'s not so different after all. We will get to the same place. Just give them time,“ Marco Santori, a counsel at Pillsbury Law company told the audience at Latin American Bitcoin Conference last weekend.\n\nRussian Point of View\n\nWhen the article was already over we got a comment from Ivan Tikhonov the founder of Bits.Media from Russia:\n\n“SBT Venture Capital, a venture capital fund supported by the Savings Bank has already stated this year that it is interested in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Thus, Mircea Mihaesku said that the fund is interested in fundamental changes that affect the entire financial sector. It seems that we are now seeing real steps towards this”.\n\nSberbank the first Russian bank intends to join the international consortium blockchain-R3, which includes more than 30 of the world\'s biggest banks.\n\nPresident of Sberbank German Gref also spoke out in support of cryptocurrency “It\'s definitely not something that should be prohibited. It. should be studied and understood fully. If cryptocurrency is really not so simple in terms of legislation, any laws regarding blockchain technology will certainly not be broken and no one is planning to prohibit it. It is therefore not surprising that the active development of this area begins with the study blockchain and implementation of solutions based on it.”', 'The North Carolina Commissioner of Banks has released a document specifying in plain English what the virtual currency exemptions are according to its Money Transmitters Act (NC MTA): virtual currency miners; Blockchain 2.0 technologies; multi-signature software; and non-hosted, non-custodial wallets are generally not subject to the NC MTA.\n\nThe clarification of its position on virtual currency comes at a time when most states have withdrawn from comment nearly altogether, in a wait-and-see-what-everyone-else-is-doing kind of approach. Or, in the case of New York, BitLicense has addressed some cryptocurrency regulatory issues, though some claim the New York regulations make sweeping generalities on other virtual currency regulatory issues, leaving them wide open to arbitrary interpretation by government officials.\n\nHowever, the North Carolina move toward being more explicit in virtual currency regulation is in part thanks to the efforts of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.\n\n“North Carolina has taken a leadership role in state-level virtual currency debates and is setting an example to other states to take a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to regulating this nascent industry,” said Perianne Boring, president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), in a statement.\n\nThe CDC sought to improve understanding on the emerging digital currency technologies and does not want overregulation to drive out innovation by the grass-roots innovators that often bootstrap their technology on modest budgets.\n\nIn a prepared statement, the CDC offered its opinion on the proposed regulations:\n\nThe North Carolina legislature is considering a bill, at the request of the Commissioner of Banks, that would update the state’s existing Money Transmitter Act to expressly include virtual currency businesses. The Chamber has been actively involved in this process, expressing concern over the proposed legislation’s broad language that could potentially be interpreted to capture certain virtual currency business models that are clearly not engaged in money transmission and should not be regulated as such. The Chamber believes that taking a broad interpretation of money transmission would subject small businesses, start-ups, and technology companies to onerous reporting requirements and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees and bonding requirements.\n\nThe exemptions expressed in the NC MTA offer some of the most unequivocal regulation on how miners, Blockchain 2.0 technology and how other cryptocurrency technology will be regulated in North Carolina. Under the NC MTA, North Carolina miners are not regulated as per the NC MTA FAQ section:\n\n. . . the NC MTA regulates the transmission of virtual currency. It does not regulate the use of virtual currency. A “user” is someone who uses virtual currency to buy or sell goods and services. A merchant who accepts virtual currency as payment for goods or services is a user and does not require a license. A “miner” is someone who receives virtual currency as payment for verifying transactions, typically by providing computer resources to process data. Once the miner has completed its work, the miner generally becomes a “user” of virtual currency.\n\nIn contrast, the New York BitLicense does not expressly exempt New York miners from regulation, with one particularly broad statement citing any one of the following activities of “controlling, administering, or issuing a Virtual Currency” as falling under New York regulation.\n\nUnder this reading, it not only potentially leaves New York miners in limbo, but also Bitcoin 2.0 technologies wishing to be implemented in New York that involve asset or currency issuing technology, such as colored coins and multi-signature technology that involves partial control over virtual currency.\n\nThe NC MTA offers a more direct approach to these issues by expressly generally exempting Bitcoin 2.0 technology and exempting multi-signature software. The NC MTA FAQ section states:\n\n... Blockchain 2.0 technologies refer to the use of the blockchain (or other similar virtual distributed ledger system) to verify ownership or authenticity in a digital capacity. This technology includes such software innovations as colored coins (i.e. coins that are marked specifically to represent a non-fiat-money asset), smart contracts (i.e. agreements implemented on a virtual distributed ledger), and smart property (i.e. property that is titled using a virtual distributed ledger). These uses of the blockchain generally do not involve the use of virtual currency as a medium of exchange. As a result, these software innovations are not regulated by the NC MTA.\n\n... Multi-signature software allows a virtual currency user to distribute authority over his or her virtual currency among multiple different actors. This software requires multiple actors to authorize a virtual currency transaction before the transaction can be consummated. Specifically, a multi-signature provider holds one of two or more private keys needed to authorize transactions. Because the multi-signature provider cannot authorize a transaction alone, this provider is not holding virtual currency on behalf of another, and does not engage in virtual currency transmission by signing transactions on behalf of the user.\n\nAlso, the NC MTA explicitly states that it will generally regulate wallet providers:\n\n... A hosted, custodial wallet provider is in the business of storing a user’s virtual currency on a remote computer until such time as the user desires to spend or exchange the user’s virtual currency. The hosted wallet provider typically agrees to safeguard the user’s private keys and make them available at some later date. This custodial function is regulated under the NC MTA.\n\nIn contrast, a non-hosted, non-custodial wallet is typically outside the scope of the NC MTA. A non-hosted wallet is a piece of software deployed on the user’s own computer or device that makes the user’s private keys easier to use by the user. In a non-hosted, non-custodial model, the software provider never gains access to the user’s private keys and does not agree to transmit the user’s virtual currency at a later time.\n\nFor many, the NC MTA serves not only to provide guidance to the virtual currency industry in North Carolina, but also to the greater virtual currency ecosystem in the United States.\n\nPhoto Jayron32 / Creative Commons', 'Melbourne-based Brighton Peak has announced today the public launch of its bitcoin exchange, the company’s flagship product.\n\nThe exchange, powered by AlphaPoint’s technology, promises to be liquid, secure and user-friendly.\n\nAlphaPoint is a US-based financial technology company that develops blockchain-enabled solutions to store, track and trade digital assets. The firm is providing Brighton Peak with a custom-built technology supporting nearly 1 million transactions per second, designed to maintain speed even during volume spikes.\n\n“We have put months of effort into creating what we believe is the most fluid, intuitive process for engaging digital currency markets and we believe these are precisely the types of solutions needed to bring the ecosystem into its maturity,” said Suryanata Wongtomo, Brighton Peak’s co-founder and managing director.\n\nLaunched in 2013, Brighton Peak initially offered Bitcoin and blockchain consulting services to businesses. In early 2014, the company announced its plans to launch a bitcoin exchange targeted at traders.\n\n“Australia has a vibrant digital currency community, and we feel it is the perfect market in which to launch a user-oriented exchange,” Wongtomo argued.\n\nThe launch of Brighton Peak’s bitcoin exchange comes two months after major banks in Australia have been reportedly closing accounts of 17 bitcoin exchanges in what the companies called a “crackdown” from the country’s banks.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) confirmed in October that it would be investigating the banks over this issue, expressing concerns over possible unlawful practices.\n\nSenator Canavan welcomed the news of the ACCC investigation, stating:\n\n“It appears to me to be an amazing coincidence that a number of large banks have all of a sudden decided to deny services to fledgling Bitcoin and digital currency operators. “They are clearly competitors to their business model, albeit small ones at this stage, and there are clear laws that we’ve got against businesses refusing to supply other businesses if they do so for an anti-competitive purpose.”\n\nThis week, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and the Coalition of Automated Legal Applications (COALA) hosted the Sydney Blockchain Workshops, a four-day event that brought together regulators, policy makers and technologist to better understand the opportunities and challenges of blockchain technology.\n\nBanks’ interest in blockchain technology had grown rapidly in recent months. A clear demonstration of this interest is the R3 blockchain consortium, which is being backed by 30 of the world’s largest banks, including two of Australia’s ‘Big Four’ banks CBA and the National Bank of Australia.\n\nEarlier this week, R3’s head of research Tim Swanson, announced that the firm has been working on the development of a generic blockchain, noting that the system is expected to start operating within a year.', 'New Bitcoin cold storage device CoolWallet from CoolbitX Technology is the size of a credit card, doesn’t need cables, fits in a common wallet and will grant owners confidence in the security of their Bitcoin wealth.\n\nCold storage is quickly becoming a popular concept within the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nConsidering the inherent risks involved in online storage of Bitcoin, the industry is devising better methods to keep the coins safe. One of these is somewhere the hackers cannot reach, i.e. (pc or smartphone).\n\nCointelegraph interviewed Shannon Yeh, Product Manager of CoolWallet, to get an in-depth analysis of the product and Alena Vranova, Product Manager of Trezor, a competitor in this marketplace for over a year for a comparison of the pros and cons of the two solutions.\n\nThe Basic Concept of CoolWallet\n\nShannon Yeh is a member of the CoolbitX Technology team of security specialists, engineers and design professionals since 2012, owned by Jetstream Holding Ltd.\n\nAccording to Shannon, CoolWallet is the first wireless hardware wallet that can be used by smartphones to manage Bitcoin transactions. Other hardware wallets require a computer and/or a cable of some kind. CoolWallet is designed primarily for convenience. It is a product that has been designed to be stable for a minimum of two-years, which simply means that the battery life is designed to perform optimally for two years and may not perform perfectly afterwards, but can still be effective.\n\nAlena Vranova, Co-Founder & Director at SatoshiLabs, producers of the Trezor cold wallet, has some doubts about this new “card wallet”.\n\nIn her opinion, CoolWallet does not ""replace"" the security of a hardware wallet or the mobility of a mobile phone or paper wallet.\n\n“I\'ve had a short look at the CoolWallet. Honestly I\'m not sure what its target market is. It is neither top secure, nor autonomously mobile per se. So it doesn\'t ""replace"" the security of a hardware wallet or the mobility of a mobile phone or paper wallet. It is nice that they want to provide a credit card form, but that alone should not be a reason to buy it.”\n\nAlena thinks that the need to have both mobile phone and the CoolWallet card charged might be a problem in real life for payments on the go.\n\nThe CoolWallet Power System\n\nShannon explained that the CoolWallet is designed with an irreplaceable inbuilt battery which is glued to the inner walls of the card covers, the battery can be recharged by an NFC charger - ‘CoolLink’ which is a system developed specifically for the CoolWallet by CoolbitX Technology.\n\nCoolWallet Operating System and Security\n\nAccording to Shannon Yeh, “CoolWallet is a HD wallet, so it is advised to have the backup seed written down and kept in a safe place. In the event of loss or damage, you can recover/restore your Bitcoins with another compatible wallet or just get another cool wallet to restore.\n\nA lot of people have also asked the similar question; what happens in the event of loss of a mobile device which is paired to CoolWallet?. With the seed your data can be restored easily. CoolWallet follows BIP32.”\n\nBut according to Alena Vranova the device is not comparable to a wallet:\n\n“If I understand correctly, it is a 2nd factor authentication card to your mobile wallet. It looks like it generates an OTP to confirm your mobile wallet transactions, the seed is generated on a mobile device, therefore considered compromised already. It\'s quite surprising that they warn about making a digital copy themselves. Also, users will need a trusted display to see the address where you are sending your Bitcoins.”\n\nEvery new product is subject to review, especially within circles where there is a direct connection with one’s cherished valuables. Bitcoiners need convenient, effective and secure ways to preserve their wealth, and will keep searching for better solutions. Various options keep emerging within the Bitcoin environment on hardware wallets, exchanges and new solutions create competition on the market,which is a good thing for the Bitcoiners population.\n\nDo you like this bitcoin wallet?

Name any form of data transfer that is responsible for every data transfer in the world? There\'s good applications and there’s bad ones, but scalability is not a showstopper.""\n\nIn part, Madden justified his belief by citing the fact that the majority of the experts in the burgeoning field have ""never worked"" in a financial company and are likely to continue to work on the bitcoin blockchain, a trend he believes is unlikely to change.\n\nThe CTO, who founded ANX in 2013 after two years working at HSBC, further suggested that the rise of blockchain is likely to mirror that of mobile financial technologies, which have also evolved without the financial industry.\n\n“I look at the next generation and I see it as a tide. You’re not going to stop this tide. We’ve lost the last mile battle. This is how the next generation works,” he said, holding up his mobile smartphone to the audience.\n\nIn this light, he contends blockchain startups are more likely to become the next Googles and Facebooks than any bank.\n\nMadden went on to say that he believes efforts like those by distributed ledger consortium R3 are being driven by a fear of missing out, but that such sentiments likely hide the fact that banks will be unable to compete against tech-savvy startups regardless of these efforts.\n\n\'Big\' comparison\n\nElsewhere, Madden put forth the argument that the hype surrounding blockchain is comparable to that around big data, a comparison that comes at a time Gartner has indicated 75% of businesses say they will invest in that technology.\n\nMadden supported his statement by referencing the impressive investment levels seen so far in the space over the course of 2015.\n\n""The hype of blockchain this year is approaching big data,"" he said. ""This year we\'ve seen the biggest-ever investments in blockchain. NYSE is prototyping blockchain settlement. I got to pitch to MasterCard.""\n\nBuilding off his previous remarks, Madden also suggested that he believes professionals in the traditional investment industry are increasingly seeking to take advantage of employment opportunities in the blockchain sector because of this momentum.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""I believe there is a bigger brain drain going on in blockchain than there was with big data.""\n\nImage via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

After a long and lively exchange, programmers, who write the software behind bitcoin, and “miners”, whose computers mint the digital currency, had indeed found some common ground. But the rapport between the two camps still seemed tentative. At one point a developer asked whether miners, who now mostly hail from China, would ever collude to steal bitcoin.\n\nUpgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors’ Picks newsletters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuspicions between developers and miners were not the only ones on display at “Scaling Bitcoin”, a conference in Hong Kong this week. Developers themselves have been feuding, too. The event was intended to end a dispute about how to expand the capacity of the bitcoin system. Currently, it can only handle seven transactions per second—a fraction of what conventional payment systems can manage. The number could be increased by allowing bigger “blocks”—the name given to the batches into which bitcoin transactions are assembled before they are processed.\n\nFor years developers have disagreed about how much, if at all, blocks should grow. Fearing that the system would soon hit its limits, two of them, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, lost patience this summer: they called on miners to install a new version of bitcoin’s software which works with much bigger blocks. The result was a rift between developers and a spasm in bitcoin’s yo-yoing value (see chart).\n\nHighly technical talks, lengthy debates and much socialising allowed the more than 200 participants at the conference to air their grievances and discuss all sorts of ways to allow bitcoin to grow. It helped that the two renegades did not attend (Mr Andresen is now a researcher at MIT’s Media Lab and Mr Hearn has joined R3 CEV, a coalition of banks developing bitcoin-like technology). Bitcoin XT, as the controversial new software is called, has not been widely adopted.\n\nAlthough details still need to be worked out, it now looks likely that developers will first—perhaps within a few months—implement technical fixes to boost bitcoin’s capacity without increasing the maximum block size. A small increase in the block size—probably from one to as many as four megabytes—is expected to come only later; it is considered a risky move that requires all computers on the bitcoin network to install new software at the same time.\n\nThat still leaves open the question of how such decisions should be made in future. Civil wars and subsequent peace conferences are an inefficient way to create consensus. As befits advocates of a currency without a central bank, neither developers nor miners want to be at the helm (in practice they share authority, since the system could not work without both groups). Some at the conference argued that, like the internet, bitcoin needs a formal governance structure. Others presented complex technical solutions that would allow market forces to decide how big blocks should be.\n\nBehind such debates lurks a bigger question: what does bitcoin want to be when it grows up? Should it be immutable, like gold, or should it adapt to the demands of its users, even if that means becoming more like a conventional payment system? Perhaps Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin, could provide guidance. Reports this week suggested he may be an Australian academic under investigation by the taxman.', 'Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin’s price is stuck in a consolidation pattern once more, as bulls are taking a break from their recent strong rally.\n\nThis type of consolidation pattern has already been seen in the past, with Bitcoin’s price making an upside breakout from the bullish continuation signal.\n\nThe Bitcoin price has formed a bullish flag pattern on its 1-hour time frame, which suggests that more buyers could join the game once an upside breakout occurs.\n\nHow High Can It Go?\n\nThe mast of the bullish flag continuation pattern is approximately $30 in height, spanning from $395 to $425, so a resulting upside move from the latest one could extend by the same amount. This could take Bitcoin prices up to $450-460 in the near-term.\n\nStronger bullish momentum could even take price up to the $500 highs this year, with plenty of traders keen to take profits off that level. If you’re bearish on bitcoins, you could wait for an actual test of the psychological resistance level to short the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the 200 SMA and has increased its distance, indicating that bullish pressure is building up. The consolidation has gotten tighter in the past few hours, hinting that a breakout is bound to take place.\n\nThe stochastic oscillator is pointing down, though, which means that buyers are already exhausted and might need to let sellers take over. RSI is also on the move down, indicating that bearish momentum is present. In that case, a downside break could lead to a pullback to the moving averages or the area of interest at $380-395.\n\nThe average directional index is heading south and understandably so, as ranging market conditions are currently in play. Potential market catalysts include the release of US retail sales and PPI numbers on Friday, as this might impact USD price action.\n\nIntraday support level – $395\n\nIntraday resistance level – $425\n\nCharts from Bitstamp, courtesy of TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

12/11/2015,"['Image: Fallout 4/Bethesda Softworks\n\nDespite two big who-is-Satoshi-Nakamoto stories at Wired and Gizmodo this week, the debate over the identity of the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin goes on. But what if Bitcoin wasn\'t made by any one or two people, but a hugely successful game company?\n\nA user on the Bitcointalk forum constructed an elaborate conspiracy theory concluding that Bethesda Softworks, the company behind the Fallout and Elder Scrolls series, was behind the creation of the cryptocurrency that now powers leagues of digital drug pushers and libertarian thought paraders.\n\nIt\'s dumb, of course, but after that fact\'s established, you have to appreciate how well-thought and committed it seems. I mean, lazy Facebook 9/11 truthers can\'t even lift a finger on this. Let\'s put our tin foil hats on for this one and play along.\n\nThe poster first observes that Fallout 3 was released three days after Nakamoto published the paper that established how exactly Bitcoin would work.\n\n""Bitcoin was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, who published the invention on 31 October 2008 in a research paper called \'Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\'"" the theorist writes. ""The US launch date of Fallout 3 was 28 October 2008 and the European launch was 30 October 2008. If techies were too busy playing Fallout 3 of course they wouldn\'t notice the publication of the Bitcoin paper. Sleight of hand?""\n\nSleight of hand, indeed! But what of its owners? Who are these shadowy figures pulling the cryptographic marionette strings? Is it some dude in Australia? Was it that one guy, Dorian? Or was it… the founder of Bethesda himself?\n\n""Interestingly, Christopher Weaver founded Bethesda in 1986 - and his education reads as this - \'After his baccalaureate degree, Weaver earned dual graduate and post-graduate degrees in Computer Science and Japanese Ethnomusicology from Wesleyan University. After returning from Japan on a student exchange program and Princeton-in-Asia Scholarship, he was elected a University Scholar at Wesleyan and went on to complete an advanced dual degree (CAS) with specialty in Japanese and Physics. He also earned a graduate degree in Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.""\n\nThe lines are connecting here. But wait, there\'s more. Have you ever looked at the full name of the company? It spells out something real interesting if you look just close enough:\n\n""If I am correct we have already established that the B in Bethesda is almost identical to the B in Bitcoin (with a few added lines and) even the B is a different colour to the rest of the \'ethesda\' part of the logo. If this is too obvious perhaps it is that way for a reason? By the way all the letters of Satoshi Nakamoto are in the words ""Bethesda Softworks A Zenimax Media Company"" as does the word \'Bitcoin.\'""\n\nMy hat\'s off. There\'s plenty more in there, including a creative 9/11 theory and a brief diversionary look at a Bible story that has nothing to do with any of this, but why not throw it in anyway?\n\nMost forum users have been playing along as if it were part of a joke, or dismissed it as a bit of a troll, or called out the original poster for just seeing things. Others said to lay off the drugs. Another user has a pretty solid point here: how could Bethesda possibly make a system as operationally sound as Bitcoin when it has a very intimate history with game bugs?\n\nNext up: I Can\'t Stop Seeing Pyramids in Fallout 4 and It\'s Really Freaking Me Out\n\nH/T Sam Biddle', 'On Tuesday, within a few hours of each other, Wired , and then Gizmodo , published articles contending that Satoshi Nakamoto, the name under which bitcoin was introduced to the world in November, 2008 , is likely the pseudonym of an Australian information-security specialist named Craig Steven Wright. Both publications were working from anonymously sourced documents provided to them in November, and although both stopped short of expressing certainty Wired risked a headline proclaiming “Bitcoin’s Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Is Probably This Unknown Australian Genius.”\n\nSoon after, I asked Gavin Andresen, who has been bitcoin’s de-facto lead developer since 2011, whether he thought the story was legitimate. He replied, “I have no idea if it’s true. I’d never heard of Craig Wright until skimming the Wired article just now.”\n\nAttempt after attempt has been made to identify Nakamoto (Joshua Davis had a go, in 2011 ). The more journalists fail, the sweeter and more tempting the prize has become, like a burgeoning lottery jackpot. But past failures have led bitcoin watchers to become skeptical of such claims, and soon enough there were growing indications that key evidence linking Wright to Nakamoto was suspect.\n\nThere are two kinds of evidence that would verify the identity of the real Nakamoto beyond reasonable doubt. One is a digitally encrypted signature originating from private keys known to belong to him. The blockchain, bitcoin’s distributed ledger, contains a record of every bitcoin transaction ever made, and Nakamoto himself conducted the first transactions on the so-called genesis block, which left unfalsifiable records of his personal bitcoin addresses. He could send bitcoins from one of these addresses in order to prove his identity or use the address to “sign” an encrypted message. Nakamoto also published an ordinary P.G.P. fingerprint, of the kind commonly used for encrypting email, in his early writings; an encrypted signature originating from that address would provide similarly strong proof. But because it would be possible to steal or otherwise acquire this information from the real Nakamoto, even the appearance of a digital signature would still require careful investigation.\n\nThe second kind of evidence would be knowledge-based. The real Nakamoto would be able to describe in detail the work that he did before launching bitcoin, in January, 2009; he would be able to produce, or at least convincingly describe, private conversations and projects that he shared with key bitcoin figures such as Andresen, who has been a core developer of the cryptocurrency’s software from its earliest days, and the late Hal Finney, a pioneering developer of P.G.P. public-key cryptography. It goes without saying that this second kind of evidence would require that the candidate be willing submit to an interview.\n\nNeither Wired nor Gizmodo was able to produce ironclad, cryptographically signed, or interview-based evidence of this kind. Instead, their cases rely on e-mails and documents purportedly taken from Wright’s computer. These include a draft trust agreement for the disposition of a cache of 1.1 million bitcoins, to be held by a company in the Seychelles whose ownership is linked, in the agreement, to an e-mail address and public keys known to have once been controlled by Nakamoto. The stories also include accounts of the strange, sad history of the late Dave Kleiman, Wright’s former colleague, who is alleged in the leaked documents to have been involved in helping conceal Wright’s identity as bitcoin’s inventor, and who died in April, 2013. Gizmodo also quoted two of Kleiman’s business partners, who claimed that Wright had told them that he and Kleiman were involved in the invention of bitcoin.\n\nThe convoluted, circumstantial nature of this evidence makes the stories look unusual, at best. To their credit, both publications acknowledged the holes; the authors of the Wired story, Andy Greenberg and Gwern Branwen, were particularly careful to allow the possibility of an elaborate hoax. As for Gizmodo, the site’s editor-in-chief, Katie Drummond, told me in an e-mail that her team had performed due diligence. “We didn’t think the hack alone was enough to go with, as compelling as some of these documents were,” she said. To try to verify the documents’ authenticity, Gizmodo hired a stringer in Sydney; sent the reporter Andy Cush, who co-wrote the story with Sam Biddle, to Florida; and relied on various experts.\n\nBut many questions remain. Gizmodo’s version of events makes much of a 2014 transcript of a meeting between Wright, his lawyer, and a representative of the Australian Taxation Office, in which Wright said, “I did my best to try and hide the fact that I’ve been running bitcoin since 2009.… By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.” The same remark appears as a pull quote in Wired’s piece. Even if the transcript is genuine, though, it’s unlikely that “running bitcoin” was meant in the sense of “running a business.” Nobody “runs” open-source software like bitcoin; not even Andresen would ever have referred to himself in this way, because such software is designed specifically to give users the chance of having some hand in its development. It’s more likely that the phrase meant running the bitcoin software used to mine the currency. (The program is a sort of computational competition for a bitcoin reward that is generated roughly every ten minutes.) It would make sense, on one level, for Wright to profess a desire to conceal that he had been mining for so long, if it were true. Anybody who’d been mining steadily since 2009—when the network consisted of a few ordinary computers, rather than thousands of massively powerful purpose-built ones, as it does today—would have amassed a ton of bitcoin; you could have bought five thousand bitcoins for around twenty-seven dollars in cash in 2009 and they would now be worth around two million dollars.\n\nIt’s also possible that the Wright didn’t really have a huge cache of bitcoin, but that he, or someone else, wanted people to believe that he did. But why?', ""This is the first article in a three-part series on whether or not Bitcoin makes a good investment. Read the second, detailing 10 arguments against investing in Bitcoin, here, and the third, outlining ways to buy, invest in and store Bitcoin, here.\n\nDisclosure: I own a small number of Bitcoin.\n\nIn the past three months alone, the price of Bitcoin has: risen steadily from below $250 to the low- to mid-$300 range, spiked past $400, plunged back down toward $300, stabilized around $325, surged again past $350 around Black Friday, then jumped even higher — after a potential uncovering of Bitcoin’s creator — to about $430 as of this morning.\n\nTaking a wider angle to look at the year, the high, $437 according to Blockchain.info, was about two and half times its low, $177 — and these gyrations don’t even begin to match those seen from 2013 to the beginning of this year, when the price went from the teens to $1,200 and back down toward the $200s.\n\nThough 2015 has proven to be the year that venture capital and Wall Street bet on the blockchain (shorthand for the distributed ledger technology behind Bitcoin), with companies ranging from Goldman Sachs to American Express, from Nasdaq to Kleiner Perkins, investing in such ventures, and VC investment in the sector totaling $314 million according to Pitchbook, it’s not clear where that leaves the currency.\n\nThere has been some movement on Wall Street around it: earlier this year, the New York Stock Exchange launched a Bitcoin index, NYXBT; the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a trust whose shares can be held in IRA, Roth IRA and other brokerage and investment accounts as well as passed on to beneficiaries, began trading; and the Winklevoss twins launched Gemini, a fully licensed and regulated Bitcoin exchange, in early October. They also have in the works an ETF, which, like GBTC, could appeal to institutions, pension plans and 401(k)s that might want exposure to Bitcoin but would not be able to own the currency directly.\n\nThese movements indicate big players are gearing up for Bitcoin to become an established part of people’s portfolios, but does that mean you should invest in it?\n\nThough Bitcoin’s value will, at any given time, reflect both belief in its fundamental value as well as temporary influences on the price — for instance, fluctuations in the past few months have been attributed to everything from Bitcoin-related Ponzi schemes to a drop in the Chinese stock market — I’ve looked at factors that could influence the price over the long term to help prospective Bitcoin investors make informed decisions.\n\nThe considerations laid out in this article are current as of the beginning of December 2015. I will revisit the subject again when developments in the Bitcoin space shift the calculus. To be clear, the pros and cons laid out in this series are not based on the current price; they are for investors looking to hold Bitcoin long-term, for whom the price on any given day in 2015 matters less than the price five, 10 or 20 years from now. In this first article in the series, I will explore reasons in favor of investing in Bitcoin.\n\n1. The supply is fixed.\n\nSince January 3, 2009, the value of one Bitcoin has climbed from nothing to north of $400 today. A lot of the worth people attribute to Bitcoin stems from its technological capabilities as a form of digital cash — a way to transfer money from one person anywhere in the world to another person anywhere in the world securely, cheaply and nearly instantaneously, with almost no worry that the sender is counterfeiting or defrauding the recipient and without need of a (fee-charging) middleman.\n\nBut over the long term, a distinct characteristic of the currency could ensure its long-term value over all others: the cap on its supply. Once 21 million Bitcoin are released (a number that will be reached around 2140), the system will stop creating new coins. In the white paper “Bitcoin: A Disruptive Currency,” Chris Burniske of ARK Investment Management, the first public fund manager to invest in Bitcoin, putting shares of GBTC into its Web x.0 ETF, contrasts that with the dollar: “While individuals, institutions and governments can expect the dollar to remain fairly stable over short-term periods of months or even years, history exposes a chilling fiscal truth. Over periods of many years the dollar has lost and probably will continue to lose much of its value …. In fact, the dollar is worth only 4% of what it was a hundred years ago.”\n\nAdditionally, the rate at which the supply of Bitcoin increases over the next hundred or so years will also slow — every four years, the number of new Bitcoin being released will be halved, further preserving its buying power. “Given its predictable growth and ultimate fixed supply, bitcoin could become a store of value superior to fiat currencies in the long term,” Burniske concludes.\n\n2. Assuming Bitcoin is adopted for number of practical applications, the value will rise significantly.\n\n“As the platform and protocol become more ingrained in society, get built into products and services, and basically become more of the mesh of society, just like the Internet, companies and people will need to own Bitcoin to play on its rails,” says Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, which has invested in 55 virtual currency companies across 17 countries. “So if you’re a business that’s paying employees or paying suppliers in Bitcoin, you may not own a lot of Bitcoin, but you’re going to own some of it. As people want to move money around the world, they’re going to be moving in and out of bitcoin quickly but they’re still going to own it for some period of time … and the size of that working capital requirement will grow as the global economy grows.”\n\nIn covering GBTC, Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria has made projections for the value of Bitcoin as far as 10 years out. His projections are based on a hypothesis similar to Silbert’s — that as Bitcoin becomes used more for transactions, a certain monetary base would be needed to power them, driving up the price. In July, he projected a 12-month target of $400 for one Bitcoin. In early November, once Bitcoin hit that number, the company updated its analysis, arriving at a 12-month price target of $600 per Bitcoin (or $60 per GBTC).\n\nHe boosted the projection because, “many more financial institutions of all varieties are now trying to employ the technology that underlies Bitcoin,” he says. “The underlying usage metrics are growing very nicely, especially the ones for an economic purpose.” Plus, he adds, some industry folks had given feedback that the previous valuation methodology had too many coins available, so he revisited some assumptions. In his analysis, he also noted that there has been an increase in payment fees, which go to the Bitcoin miners who push transactions through. (Their current revenue comes mostly from being awarded new Bitcoin.)\n\nLuria’s projection starts with fact that the number of Bitcoins will be capped and then accounts for the likelihood that a certain percentage of Bitcoin will be held for investment or dormant due to loss of keys to coins or for other reasons. For instance, it assumes that 50% are now being held for investment or are dormant and the other half used for working capital. However, by the year 2025, it projects that 67% of all coins will be available for transactions.\n\nThe analysis posits that a certain amount of Bitcoin will be used for online payments, remittances, micro-transactions (such as paying a tiny amount to read an article in lieu of seeing ads), applications for the unbanked and other, unknown applications and projects growth rates for each application. It then calculates the Bitcoin monetary base required to support that amount of transactions and works backward using a 40% discount rate (to determine what the present value of Bitcoin needs to be in order to support that amount of economic activity in 2025). After adding up all the Bitcoin needed for online payments, remittances, micro-transactions, the unbanked and other applications in the year 2025, he concludes that one Bitcoin will, by then, be worth $17,473, and that the present value of a Bitcoin would need to be $604 today to support that amount of economic activity in 2025. If Luria’s projection becomes true, anyone investing today would see a 40+x return within 10 years.\n\n3. More and more people and businesses seem to be using Bitcoin.\n\nIf transaction volume will drive up the price, then trends in both transactions and merchant adoption bode well for the value of Bitcoin.\n\nOverall daily transaction volume has increased over time, as shown in this chart from Blockchain.\n\nAnd data from Bitcoin merchant processor BitPay, launched in 2011, when the Bitcoin ecosystem was new, shows a general trend toward increased merchant transactions.\n\nThough in the short term, transaction volume will not have a significant impact on price — in fact, as you can see, over 2015, transaction volume has increased as the price has remained roughly the same — over the long term it will, says BitPay CEO Stephen Pair. “And that's the reason for the nearer term speculative activity in bitcoin,” Pair wrote in an email. “If people didn't think the adoption would be there in the long term, they wouldn't be investing in bitcoin.”\n\nWhile only 2% of merchants currently accept Bitcoin, another 25% expects to offer it within the next two years, according to a recent survey by Goldman Sachs and the Electronic Transactions Association. ARK estimates that 160,000 merchants already accept Bitcoin, and that by 2017, that number could rise to 1.8 million.\n\nBitPay is also seeing a shift in the types of businesses interested in using its service that could be good news for the value of Bitcoin. Previously, sole proprietorships owned by people who were Bitcoin enthusiasts but didn’t necessarily have a business need for the cryptocurrency were signing up. Now, “we are finding businesses that find real utility and real value in the platform,” Pair said in an interview. “Those, to me, are the early signs of a tipping point. It’s businesses that don’t really care much about Bitcoin itself or the idea of Bitcoin. They just know it solves a problem or saves them money.”\n\nOne example: If hackers hit a bank with a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack, taking its website offline, the bank may hire a DDOS mitigation service in another country and would need to pay this anti-hacking team fast. Many of them are now using BitPay to conduct this international transaction within a few minutes, rather than using time-consuming wire transfers. In general, Pair says a lot of IT services companies such as web hosting companies and VPN providers are turning to BitPay for payments.\n\nAlready, everyday people in countries that have volatile currencies like Argentina, or countries like Indonesia, Russia, the Philippines and India where banking infrastructure and credit cards are not well developed but people have smart phones and would like to buy online, are using Bitcoin for practical purposes. Wences Casares, CEO of Xapo, a Bitcoin bank and digital wallet, says, “Our customers in the U.S. and the rest of the developed world are holding Bitcoin as an investment. They don’t do any transactions. They’re not using Bitcoin for payments. The customers we have in emerging markets use Bitcoin almost exclusively for payments, and they are high, high volume transactors. They are using the debit card six times a week.”\n\n4. A higher price could increase transaction volume, which would then further boost the price.\n\nOne theory holds that as the price of Bitcoin rises, people are tempted to hold onto the currency rather than use it. But the evidence so far seems to indicate otherwise, lending credence to speculators’ belief that, as more people transact in Bitcoin, the price will increase.\n\n“What we see during price spikes is a corresponding spike in transaction volume (followed by a mean reversion when the price falls back),” Pair of BitPay wrote in an email.\n\nAdam White, vice president of business development at Coinbase, one of the earliest Bitcoin wallets and exchanges, says the company sees similar activity: “When the price goes up, there’s a lot more interest — and that almost always means more users, higher transaction volume, people are buying more Bitcoin, they’re creating accounts, they’re using it. Some of those users start to say, ‘Hey, Bitcoin was $250 a day ago, now it’s $275. I’m going to sell.’ So there are users that, when the price goes up, they want to lock in some of those gains.” However, he emphasizes, movements in the price don’t prompt everyone to act in the same way, and many other factors beyond price fluctuations are even more influential on the demand for the currency.\n\nSilbert believes that a price jump creates a wealth effect — like a gambler who decides to spend some of her winnings at a luxury store at a casino, people feel wealthier when their Bitcoin increases in value, prompting them to spend it, which in turn makes more merchants interested in accepting it. “As more merchants accept it, they convert it to U.S. dollars, and that creates more transactional volume on the exchanges, and as you have more transactional volume on the exchanges, it tends to to attract more traders, which produces more volatility and ways to make money,” he says. “As you have more traders, you have more liquidity and velocity and it becomes possible for Bitcoin the rail, the technology, to be used as an alternative means to spend money around the world.”\n\n5. Bitcoin has a first-mover advantage among the other digital currencies.\n\nThough Bitcoin faces competition from other digital currencies, at the moment, it seems unlikely to be dethroned. Not only does Bitcoin have the largest market capitalization of any of the digital currencies — $6.5 billion, as of press time, compared to $268 million and $164 million for its next competitors, Ripple and Litecoin, respectively — but also many more apps are being built on top of it than any other virtual currency, also including Ethereum, Stellar, etc. All the major digital currency wallets, exchanges, payment processors, etc., use Bitcoin, and even several apps that don’t market themselves as Bitcoin companies, such as Circle, Abra, Align Commerce and Uphold, use Bitcoin in the background, mostly to transfer money. Few, especially among cryptocurrency companies marketing themselves to audiences outside the core group of enthusiasts, support any other virtual currency.\n\nWhile cautionary tales like AOL and MySpace show that a first-mover advantage isn’t everything, Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, one of the most active Bitcoin exchanges, rejects the comparison. “Friendster, MySpace and Facebook are not true network effects,” he says, using the term used to describe when a good or service becomes more valuable the more people use it. “In the end, they are controlled entities. They live or die based on what those executives do — whereas Bitcoin is open.”\n\nEven more, the Bitcoin network is “several orders of magnitude more secure than its competitors probably combined,” says BitPay’s Pair, mostly because its mining network — the global network of computers worldwide that update the Bitcoin transaction ledger in order to be awarded new bitcoins as they are issued — is orders of magnitude more powerful than networks of any of its competitors. Pair says other digital currencies will have to overcome this network effect as well as the fact that Bitcoin has the most liquidity of any of the digital currencies.\n\n“For company like BitPay, if are going to accept a form of payment, and it’s a cryptocurrency, we need to make sure that we have buyers for that cryptocurrency so that we can convert it into some other asset that the merchant wants to be settled in,” he says. Also, he says, if a virtual currency’s markets are thin and the spreads are high, it could be too volatile for the company to manage its risk in accepting that as a form of payment.\n\n“A competitor would have to produce something that was both more secure and more liquid than Bitcoin,” he says. “And from our perspective, if we’re offering an Internet payment processing service, and it’s pretty easy to convert from any asset into Bitcoin and also convert from Bitcoin into any other asset, and Bitcoin is the most secure form of payment of all the choices we could make, why would we not choose to only accept Bitcoin? … So, for us to change to something else, it would first have to overcome Bitcoin’s security and liquidity properties and then we would probably switch from Bitcoin into only that alternative — because there would no longer be a reason to accept Bitcoin.”\n\n6. So far, the attitude of most government regulation toward digital currencies has been, on the whole, cautiously positive.\n\nAt least in the United States, digital currency consumers and businesses have a decent amount of clarity around how the federal and some state governments will treat their activities. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service has said it will treat it as property for tax purposes and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, as a commodity. Plus, the Fed has said it cannot regulate Bitcoin. Some of these regulations, like New York state’s Bitlicense “may unintentionally create barriers to entry for new entrants, but here in the U.S., with companies like Coinbase, BitPay, Circle, Xapo and others, they are well-funded and are lawyered up and so are prepared to deal with whatever comes their way,” says Silbert. Internationally, the reactions span everything from Russia’s plans to ban conversions between rubles and cryptocurrencies to a ruling in Europe cheered by investors that Bitcoin was exempted from value-added tax (VAT). “In some places, the government is just getting up to speed and hasn’t taken a position yet. In other places, we’re seeing active government involvement and support,” says Silbert. “It doesn’t mean it will be a clear and easy road, but I’m cautiously optimistic given that the more developed financial markets all seem to be embracing the technology.”\n\n7. A comparison to gold suggests Bitcoin could be undervalued.\n\nSilbert made his name as the founder of SecondMarket, a platform that enabled private companies to raise capital and allow their stakeholders to sell shares. He believes Bitcoin has two close analogs, the first being gold.\n\n“Bitcoin has all the same attributes of gold in that it’s scarce, there’s a finite supply, it’s fungible, it’s highly divisible, it can’t be counterfeit,” he says, “but it has one real improvement over gold, which is its utility.” Gold is good for jewelry and use in some industrial production processes, but as the price increases, it becomes less useful for both those uses, he says, “whereas Bitcoin, on the other hand, actually becomes more useful. It becomes more useful as a [money transfer] rail and as a ledger [of financial transactions].”\n\nToday, the total value of gold rounds up to about $7 trillion, while the market cap of Bitcoin the day I spoke to Silbert was about $5 billion (it’s $6.5 billion as of press time). If, in periods of economic dislocation, people put their money into Bitcoin the way they’ve historically done with gold and Treasuries, the price of Bitcoin could rise, surmises Silbert: “If you look at what happened during the Greece crisis [when the price of Bitcoin rose past $300], the Bitcoin price went up, and I think there is reason to believe that Bitcoin — as a store of value, as a speculative investment — would perform well in periods of dislocation or distress.” If so, he presents a hypothetical: If just 5% of the $7 trillion in gold moved into Bitcoin, that would boost its value by $350 billion. “So that would be a 70x increase in the price of Bitcoin if just 5% of gold, which, again, is just one use case, moves into Bitcoin.”\n\nLee of BTCC says the best way to think about Bitcoin’s value is per capita. And again, that puts it in a favorable light against gold. Right now, Bitcoin worth less than $1 per person worldwide, whereas gold, which Lee calls “a so-called disregarded asset class that no one wants to talk about, the dirty four-letter word G-O-L-D” is about $1,000 per person. But, he estimates that perhaps over the next few decades, Bitcoin’s value could skyrocket to $1,000 per person or higher, giving it a market cap of more than $7 trillion — almost 1,100 times what it is today.\n\n8. Comparing Bitcoin with a technology company also suggests it could someday be quite valuable.\n\nHaving spent most of his career in valuations, Silbert believes a good second analog to Bitcoin could be a technology company. In this thought experiment, Bitcoin the “company” has authorized 21 million shares to be issued, with about 14.9 million currently outstanding, and has a market cap of $5.9 billion. If you look at businesses that could be affected by this new “company” Bitcoin, some may include Western Union, which has a $9.5 billion market capitalization and PayPal, which has a $43 billion market capitalization.\n\n“As a technology, as a protocol, as a platform, could Bitcoin have the same impact on society as a Facebook or a Google or an Apple has had? The answer is that it could. I’m not saying it’s going to, but it could,” says Silbert, noting that Apple’s market cap is nearing $650 billion. He acknowledges that this method disregards factors such as price-to-earnings ratios and cash flows and adds, “the owner of a Bitcoin isn’t ever going to see a dividend, and you’re never going to get bought out,” but says that the savings that Bitcoin could generate for financial services companies — estimated by Santander Innoventures to be $15 billion-$20 billion annually by 2022 from cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance — is somewhat akin to earnings. “So if Bitcoin as a company was to save annually, say, $10 billion from the world, and you were to apply a 15 [price-earnings] multiple to $10 billion, that’s a $150 billion market cap company,” he says, then adding, “again, I’m conflating a lot of different concepts.”\n\n9. On pure trading metrics alone, it looks like a buy.\n\nIf you ascribe to the philosophy that patterns in securities’ past behavior can predict their future performance, you would have reason to expect that Bitcoin would continue to rise. For instance, one theory says that if the 50-day moving average, which is the average of the stock price over the previous 50 days, is below where the security is presently trading, whenever it hits that moving average, it will bounce back up.\n\n“The longer a time period a moving average covers, the stronger it is.… Bitcoin has strong support at its 200-week moving average of $252.59, and just broke through resistance at its 100-week moving average of $388.54,” ARK’s Burniske wrote in an email, but “bitcoin’s inarguably enjoying a strong uptrend and clearing key resistance levels, which could give it legs to run.”\n\n10. More investors are taking it seriously and using it as a portfolio diversifier.\n\nMichael Sonnenshein, Grayscale’s director of business development who talks with institutional investors and financial advisors interested in investing in GBTC, says he has seen a fundamental shift in the types of investors interested in Bitcoin. For the last few years, he says it’s mostly been ultra high-net-worth individuals, family offices and smaller institutions or tech-type investors who can more easily wrap their head around Bitcoin.\n\n“What we’re starting to experience now is unprecedented interest from the financial advisor community as they are seeing a tremendous increase in the fielding of questions and inquiries from their clients and their clients’ children and relatives about Bitcoin — should this be something that they are looking at to invest?” He’s also seen a huge uptake in institutional interest due to heavy-hitting financial institutions investing in this space. “When people start seeing the Visas and MasterCards and the American Expresses of the world beginning to get involved with Bitcoin and blockchain technology, it suddenly wakes up in a lot of people that this is something they too should be looking at,” he says. Plus, he sees that people who have been affected by global market gyrations in China or Greece are turning to digital currency as another portfolio diversifier.\n\nThese 10 arguments may have you ready to buy, however, a number of issues, which I will cover in part two of this series, cast doubt on the future value of Bitcoin. And even today’s projections are merely that — projections. “When you try to figure out what that price will be in 10 years, and you apply assumptions to it, and you apply it back to today, very small changes in your assumptions have a pretty meaningful impact on the price,” says Silbert. “From that perspective, it’s very easy to come up with a calculation to show that the price of Bitcoin is going to go to $10,000, and with some tweaks, I could get that back down to $100.”\n\nMore importantly, the question of whether or not to invest in Bitcoin depends on your own investment goals, time horizon and risk appetite. “In 10 years, the price will either be zero or much higher than it is today and so, as such, anybody who puts money into Bitcoin should only put money into Bitcoin that they can afford to lose,” says Silbert.\n\nThis is the first article in a three-part series on whether or not Bitcoin makes a good investment. Read the second, detailing 10 arguments against investing in Bitcoin, here, and the third, outlining ways to buy, invest in and store Bitcoin, here.\n\nUpdate Friday December 11, 1:50pm EST: The chart illustrating the theory that a stock bounces up after hitting its 50-week moving average was not of Bitcoin in particular.\n\nUpdate Friday December 11, 4:30pm EST: A typo incorrectly stated the amount of venture capital in Bitcoin; it's $314 million, not billion."", 'Four weeks: That\'s how long Swedish bitcoin mining company KnCMiner takes to build a new datacenter, from breaking ground to beginning operations.\n\n""The longest part is signing the agreement,"" CEO Sam Cole said Friday, announcing plans for another 20MW datacenter in the Swedish town of Boden, part of the ""Node Pole"" technology cluster near Lulea where Facebook built one of its most energy-efficient datacenters.\n\nOne reason for the speed is that KnC doesn\'t have to worry about air conditioning. The Node Pole is on the edge of the Arctic Circle, where cooling can be as simple as opening a door.\n\nIt\'s barely six months since KnC announced its last datacenter, which is already up and running.\n\nKnC employs a continuous construction process for its datacenters: Staff began installing and powering up the first racks while contractors were still bolting together prefabricated parts for the adjoining section.\n\nThe ground hasn\'t been cleared for the next one yet -- ""There are trees there now,"" Cole said -- but he\'s confident it will be ready by March, or perhaps February -- four weeks after the chips are delivered for the machines that the datacenters will house.\n\n""In our game, timing is everything,"" he said.\n\nKnC\'s game is bitcoin mining, the process of validating successive blocks of data in the blockchain, the distributed ledger used to record bitcoin transactions, by calculating a cryptographic hash. Miners are rewarded with bitcoins for each block successfully validated, which means the more processing power they can apply to the task, and the more efficiently they can operate it, the greater the reward.\n\nAs demand grew for mining capacity, or the computing power dedicated to processing the blockchain, KnC hit on the idea of developing custom chips to speed up the hashing operation. It combined these application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) into mining rigs and sold them to would-be bitcoin miners, then later began hosting and operating the rigs itself. Earlier this year it introduced a new generation of mining chips built with a 16-nanometer, 3D FinFET production process more often used to make high-performance ARM processors for mobile phones.\n\nBitcoin mining is a numbers game. The bitcoins that can be won aren\'t ""free money,"" as there\'s a capital cost involved in building the equipment, whether you have one processor core working on it or millions, and operational costs, primarily electricity.\n\nMiners seek to optimize the performance of their rigs, measured in hashes per second, and reduce their energy consumption. When KnC takes delivery of a batch of new, more efficient ASICs, it wants to get them up and running as soon as possible.\n\nThe new datacenter, like the last one, will have a power consumption of 20MW, but Cole won\'t say how many hashes per second it will perform.\n\n""The hashing capacity is commercially sensitive,"" he said, and depends on many factors, including the design of the mining chips and the quality of the batch used.\n\nThe computing resources dedicated to bitcoin mining worldwide have a capacity of about 633 petahashes per second, and about 5 percent of those resources are controlled by KnC, according to blockchain.info, which provides statistics on bitcoin transactions.', 'US, December 11, 2015 at 16:40 UTC\n\nATLANTA - Coinnections, a SaaS technology company announced today that it has launched a private beta of its AML and KYC compliance software for Bitcoin MSBs. A limited group of Cryptocurrency MSBs such as Bitcoin ATMs and exchanges are invited to beta test this new extensive compliance suite. Beta testers will enjoy early access and a half hour of free compliance consulting with BitAML.\n\nCoinnections provides a comprehensive AML/KYC compliance platform designed to consistently enforce a business’s AML compliance policy. Coinnections’ combination of powerful AML transaction monitoring, case management, enhanced due diligence, electronic SAR/CTR filing, and intuitive workflow reduces the complexity of compliance responsibilities.\n\nCoinnections was founded by former payments industry product manager and entrepreneur Aaron Williams. Williams made his debut into the Bitcoin world in 2013 when he took delivery of the first Lamassu Bitcoin ATM machine. He immediately experienced the need for an integrated AML product. “Since then the vision has developed,” explained Williams. “Coinnections is more than an AML compliance platform. We’ve put a lot of focus on auditing and change management as well. Auditing in the MSB space tends to be very resource intensive so we architected our systems to take as much legwork out of the audit process as possible.”\n\nAs digital currencies and blockchain technology begin to be incorporated into day to day life, the FinCEN bureau at the U.S. Department of the Treasury is applying heavy emphasis on the regulation of transactions through anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing compliance. In order to meet legal requirements, money services businesses (MSBs) must develop an AML compliance program and report to FinCEN if suspicious or unusual activities are detected. “We are very excited about the potential for the Coinnections platform to simplify the management and enforcement of compliance programs for MSBs, as it was created to meet FinCEN regulations,” says bitcoin compliance expert Joe Ciccolo. Cryptocurrency MSBs are welcome to visit the Coinnections website to request beta access.\n\nAbout Coinnections\n\nCoinnections is an AML/KYC solutions technology company offering SaaS products to manage, automate, and enforce the regulatory compliance of Bitcoin MSBs.

[PDF]\n\nCCN reported on DeMorgan Ltd, the parent company of Cloudcroft and one listed by Craig Wright on his LinkedIn page as its CEO. At the time of publishing the referenced article, the website of DeMorgan Ltd and Craig Wright’s LinkedIn page were active and accessible. Now, the company website is seemingly offline while the LinkedIn profile is not as accessible as it was before. More specifically to the point, DeMorgan Ltd claimed to own a supercomputer called C01N or Tulip Trading, on its website, supposedly ranked #15th (now #17th) in the world of supercomputers.\n\nAdditional evidence, pointed to by ZDNet highlights a blog article published in December 2014 on Cloudcroft. The blog entry shows Wright claiming Cloudcroft to have the “biggest supercomputer cluster in Australia, with just under 5 petabytes.”\n\nThe Denial\n\nAs it turns out, SGI chief operating officer and executive vice president Cassio Conceicao has claimed that SGI has had no relationship with Craig Wright. Speaking to the publication, he said:\n\nCloudcroft has never been an SGI customer and SGI has no relationship with Cloudcroft CEO Craig Steven Wright.\n\nFurthermore, he added that there was no previous record of SGI being purchased or serviced by the firm. In a tweet, Craig Wright claimed to have merged C01N and Tulip Trading to form the supercomputer.\n\nConceicao confirmed:\n\nSGI has no record of the C01N supercomputer ever being purchased or serviced by SGI, therefor SGI suspects it may have been purchased on the grey market. SGI does not operate, maintain or provide any services for this supercomputer.\n\nCraig Wright figured among the most talked about people in recent days after recent investigations from WIRED and Gizmodo alleged him to be Bitcoin’s secretive and pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nCredit to ZDNet for the story.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and SGI.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Correction: Article has been updated to reflect that one-year high is based on BPI closing prices; 36% gain was achieved in last two weeks, not last four days.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has hit its highest closing price in the last year, trading at $436 and climbing at press time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.\n\nBitcoin has gained an astonishing $115 or 36% over the last two weeks. It was changing hands for $320 a coin on 25th November. The price briefly touched $500 on some exchanges on 4th November before dropping under $400 in the following days.\n\nThe strong rally is accompanied by record-breaking trading volumes on bitcoin exchanges. On 5th December 3.49 million bitcoins were traded across all exchanges tracked by data provider Bitcoinity. This smashed the previous record for daily traded volume established just days prior, on 26th November, of 2.86 million coins traded.\n\nTrading volume has remained robust since its high watermark, with daily trading consistently closing above the 2 million BTC level.\n\nFalling Yuan\n\nMarket-watchers offered theories ranging from the falling price of the yuan, to the media hoopla around a supposed unmasking of Satoshi Nakamoto by two prominent technology publications, to an abundance of positive newsflow around the blocksize debate.\n\nDaniel Masters, who runs the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment fund that is widely known as GABI, said a weaker yuan was driving Chinese investors into bitcoin. The yuan has fallen 4% against the US dollar this year. He told CoinDesk:\n\n""It\'s pretty simple in my view ... A domestic Chinese investor is faced with falling yuan, falling commodity prices and falling real estate prices. One of the few alternatives is bitcoin, which is negatively correlated to all of this.""\n\nIndeed, the exchanges with the most volume traded were the ones based in the mainland, with OKCoin and Huobi leading the way. Observers have previously noted that exchange volume figures, which are self reported, should be treated with caution because they can be manipulated.\n\nMasters said China will continue to be a major factor driving the bitcoin price up in the long term as its economy continues to slow and the yuan sheds value.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported four days ago that the bitcoin rally was being driven by traders arbitraging the cryptocurrency and units of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which is publicly traded.\n\nUnlikely Arbitrage\n\nAlthough the Journal did not describe the arbitrage mechanism, its story claimed that narrowing spreads between the bitcoin price and the GBTC price allowed traders to profit as they would when arbitraging an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and its underlying assets.\n\n""The increased activity on the OTCQX-traded fund may have triggered a wave of bitcoin buying, contributing to the price spike,"" the Journal wrote.\n\nMarket watchers on r/BitcoinMarkets have discounted this theory, pointing out that shares in GBTC traded in the public markets must be held by unit-holders for at least a year, meaning they are disconnected from the current bitcoin price.\n\n""There is no mentionable arbitrage mechanism, only GBTC shares you can buy/sell are the year-old+ [Bitcoin Investment Trust] ones,"" one punter wrote on r/BitcoinMarkets.\n\nInstitutional trader Harry Yeh of Binary Financial said a slew of news coverage around bitcoin in the previous weeks has been a critical price driver.\n\nPositive newsflow\n\nYeh pointed to the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong, which produced the \'segregated witness\' scaling solution that doesn\'t require a hard fork as one example. Additionally, the Satoshi \'unmasking\' by Wired and Gizmodo has cast a spotlight on the cryptocurrency, he said.\n\nYeh said bitcoin may simply be rebounding from a pronounced price dive in 2014, when it was ""very oversold"". Conversely, he said the technical indicators, in his view, showed that bitcoin is now on a trajectory similar to its massive run-up in 2013, which led to it breaking the $1,000 mark.\n\nYeh said:\n\n""Looking at all the factors and the technical factors ... bitcoin could rocket past $600.""\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It uses renewable energy for all its data center operations and has a well known commitment to having the smallest carbon footprint possible.\n\nThis new mega data center will have a capacity of 40 MW of electricity to process transactions using BitFury\'s latest generation 28 nm and 16 nm Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips. It will take full advantage of BitFury\'s proprietary immersion cooling technology developed by Allied Control which was acquired earlier this year, as well as locally sourced hydroelectric energy.\n\nBitFury CEO Valery Vavilov, said: ""This data center will take immersion cooling technology to the next level and set a new standard for data processing using renewable energy. BitFury is leading the innovation in this space and we are proud to unveil our new data center and to work with our global partners to advance this important work.""\n\nAllied Control specialises in two-phase (2PIC) immersion cooling technology which significantly increases power density to a record-breaking 250kW per horizontal rack from about 5kW to 10kW average, reduces cooling energy consumption by more than 96% with a PUE of 1.02, accelerates deployment time drastically and delivers on environmental sustainability.\n\nBitFury builds its own ASICs, PCBs, servers and data centers. Allied Control\'s 2PIC technology makes it possible to run fewer chips hotter, and recycle virtually all of the waste heat for local industrial or municipal use.\n\nThis growth and progression can provide a roadmap for high performance computing as it evolves toward and beyond the upcoming ""Exahash Era"" – the time when the Bitcoin network computing power exceeds 1,000 petahashes (quintillion hash operations) per second, said a statement.', 'Melbourne-based Brighton Peak has launched its Bitcoin exchange in Australia as the mainstream appeal of the cryptocurrency gains steam.

It has introduced the exchange as its flagship product in the wake of phenomenal growth in Bitcoin trading. We have discussed the same and several other indicators which may contribute to further growth in a previous article.\n\nThe Company is AML-compliant and charges a trading fee based on a customer’s 30-day AUD volume. See the infographic below for the breakdown:\n\nThe Australian startup has roped in the US-based AlphaPoint to handle the back-end operations. Joe Ventura, CEO of AlphaPoint said:\n\n“We’re excited Brighton Peak has selected us to provide and maintain their tech backbone. By leveraging strategic access to global trading activity, Brighton Peak’s exchange will be able to offer Australian traders and businesses competitive exchange rates and deep, persistent order flows.”\n\nIn order to offer a smooth, secure and quick flow of Bitcoin trades, AlphaPoint’s infrastructure will support nearly 1 million transactions per second. To ensure abundant liquidity at all times, Brighton Peak is connected with leading digital currency exchanges.\n\nThe competition is heating up in the Australian Bitcoin space, as new entrants seek to profit from the growth in Bitcoin trading volume. The customers will also have the option of selecting the best exchange, which offers them the peace of mind in terms of security of assets and funds, and is also easy on the pocket.', 'Yesterday the exchange rate of the BTC/USD pair went into a sideways trend at the level $410.

However, Bitcoin has enough strength to grow. Overcoming the level of $420 will inspire confidence to the rest a number of customers and they will rush to join the game. As the result, Bitcoin will be quite capable to reach the level of $450-460 soon after. Thus, in the afternoon high volatility of the BTC/USD pair is possible.\n\nToday, December 11th, 2015, the resistance levels are $425 and $430.

12/12/2015,"['Dr Craig Steven Wright, the Australian scientist named in the press this week as the possible founder of bitcoin, once hacked into his internet-connected coffee maker.\n\nDr Wright is an obscure Australian computer-science and cybersecurity entrepreneur, and was identified by Wired and Gizmodo as the potential anonymous creator of the digital currency.\n\nSomebody or a group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin in 2009. Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that uses cryptography to move money and records it in a ledger without the need of a bank.\n\nDr Wright has disappeared in the wake of the accusations, scrubbing all digital records of himself and becoming unreachable at his home.\n\nIn 2008, a Craig Wright posted to the BugTraq security list that he had found software vulnerabilities with his internet connected Jura F90 Coffee maker.\n\nIt appears to be the same Wright linked to bitcoin, as DeMorgan, a company run by the Dr Wright, mentions the incident on its website.\n\nBusiness Insider tried both of the telephone numbers listed on the BugTraq posting, but both were disconnected. An email to the address used got a bounce back.\n\nThe coffee maker, which costs around £900, connects to the internet via a local computer to enable remote engineers to diagnose problems and try to fix them. It also lets the user remotely adjust the strength of their coffee.\n\nBut Wright found that: ""The software allows a remote attacker to gain access to the Windows XP system it is running on at the level of the user. Compromise by Coffee."" The story was picked up by CNET at the time.\n\nThe above screenshot from DeMorgan\'s website also mentions hacking of a Boeing 747. That appears to relate to a blog post Dr Wright authored in 2011.\n\nDr Wright says he was contracted to test the systems on a Boeing 747 and managed to access the engine control system via the plane\'s video system. Security researcher Chris Roberts reportedly hacked into a plane\'s engine systems through the in-flight entertainment system earlier this year.', 'Six years after its introduction to the masses, Bitcoin, the decentralized currency known as “cash for the Internet,” is growing in popularity. Yet it still remains largely shrouded in mystery.\n\nFrom the identity of its mysterious inventor to the head-scratching complexities of how exactly it works, Bitcoin and virtual currencies like it were largely embraced by computer programmers. Now these currencies have since begun to edge into the mainstream. Businesses, both brick-and-mortar and online, have begun accepting it as a form of payment, and GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul has said he would accept campaign donations via Bitcoin. More than 400 Bitcoin ATMs have popped up across the world, and the idea has spawned others like it that have grown in popularity.\n\nThese rapidly evolving and volatile currencies haven’t gone unnoticed by the Minnesota Department of Commerce, whose leader this week told potential virtual currency investors to be careful — in part because it’s not controlled or backed by a central government or bank, and therefore is subject to little regulation. That’s not to say it lacks cash value.\n\nAs of Thursday, a single Bitcoin was worth more than $415, according to CoinDesk, which tracks its daily value. By Friday morning, the value rose to $445.\n\n“It’s in its infancy in a way — the industry is developing and it’s got to prove itself,” Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman said. “Some very legitimate companies are taking a look at it and developing it for legitimate purposes to buy and sell goods.”\n\nRothman, however, warns of “a dark side” because it remains “off the radar screen.”\n\nIndeed, the anonymity afforded by virtual currencies has enabled some nefarious dealings, including drug activity and money laundering. Although the state commerce department has no reports of investors who may have been scammed, he continues to urge caution.\n\n“I just know that we’re not an island in the world and I’m assuming there are Minnesotans who are savvy working in the Internet area and are potentially part of these transactions,” Rothman said.\n\nRothman said the commerce department has monitored Bitcoin for the past several years and tracked how it’s being treated by federal regulators. At this point, it’s considered by the Internal Revenue Service to be a form of property and must be reported on federal taxes.\n\nAlthough backers of virtual currency laud its decentralization and lack of regulation, Rothman said those same attributes bring enormous risk. Aside from being susceptible to cyberattacks or other losses that can’t be recouped, it simply doesn’t come with recourse. Investing in Bitcoin, he said, is not like investing in silver and gold, which are backed by the federal government.\n\n“If a consumer or investor is harmed, savings or other investments are backed by the FDIC of the good faith and credit of banks,” Rothman said. “Here, you’re dealing with a completely private marketplace.”\n\nQuestions about virtual currency?

The receipt shows that the vendor, “Pyroman79”, listed the box of 20 triangle crackers under the “Weapons” category. “They are cheap and have a loud bang,” the vendor explains in the item description.\n\nMs Weisskopf said she both “excited and scared” about what the postman might end up delivering over the next few weeks.\n\nWhen the artists ran their Random Darknet Shopper project in Switzerland between October 2014 and January this year the entire exhibition was seized by the public prosecutor in St Gallen after the badly behaved bot purchased a bag of ecstasy pills.\n\nRead more\n\nRobot that bought MDMA, passport and baseball cap released by authorities\n\nThe authorities were unsure about how to build a case, though. “It was a bit unclear who they could press charges against,” Ms Weisskopf said. “They were unwilling to press charges against the bot. They decided that within the realm of art it should be possible to look at such things within an exhibition.”\n\nThe artists insist that while some transactions on the deep web involve dubious items such as drugs and weapons, for the most part it is actually “very nerdy”.\n\n“A lot of the thing for sale are really pop culture items that people between 18 and 30 are interested in - the sneakers or jeans you need to have, or ebooks or hardware,” said Mr Smoljom. “They may be legally or illegally produced,” he added.\n\nIndependent\n\nIndependent News Service', ""Bitwala, a service allowing bill payment with Bitcoin in the EU, has just introduced its newest feature. Customers have an opportunity to use Bitcoin Debit Card and thus spend their bitcoins almost directly.\n\nThere are two kinds of card: virtual for the price of 5 EUR or physical which costs 10 EUR. The most outstanding feature compared to other competitors: the fee for card loading. Bitwala set it up at 0.5% of the amount, with a 1 EUR minimum. The same fee when users are making SEPA payments.\n\nJörg von Minckwitz, CEO of Bitwala told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Day by day we try to make it possible for our customers to live of Bitcoin entirely. With SEPA integration, it is already an equivalent to bank account but it was still hard to order stuff on the internet or get cash at an ATM. With our debit card program we solved those problems for Bitcoin users once and for all.”\n\nAlthough a three day period for loading up the card seems quite long, Jörg von Minckwitz assures that the process is actually faster, but for the start they didn't want to promise anything they can't achieve. That's why there is a maximum of three days. Most of the small loads will be processed in almost real time during european office hours. The average for larger amounts should be around 24 hours.\n\nUnlike Others\n\nFor example, unlike Mycelium Bitcoin card, card balance is held in Euro, so it's not a real Bitcoin card. However, users can pay or withdraw everywhere where Visa is accepted. We see our debit card as a service to our customers, that's why we chose the same 0.5% fee that we charge on all our transfers. As far as I know that is the cheapest of all Bitcoin Debit issuers.“\n\nGeorge Basiladze of Cryptopay.me does not fear new competitors:\n\n“These guys are very small. They use BitPay for processing and another bitcoin company for cards. We, cryptopay.me, have a bitcoin debit card which can be funded with bitcoin or Cryptopay balance. The card has been launched in August. We’ve been on the market for more than two years, have more compatible rates, have several currencies, and we accept bank transfers in the UK and EU as well as debit cards.”\n\nFranco Cimatti, president of Bitcoin Foundation Italia commented:"", 'Chris Skinner is a banking and technology veteran who serves as the chairman of the Financial Services Club, a group created in 2004 to address the future of companies that serve financial markets.\n\nI’m often asked how quickly the changes I outline will take place, and my answer is between 10 and 20 years.\n\nThe building of the real-time, almost free financial network on the Internet using blockchain and mobile will take about a decade at least before it becomes mainstream. ""Oh,"" some go. ""That\'s a way off. Can we talk about something happening sooner?""\n\nThat\'s an interesting reaction, as sure, we could talk about how Apple Watch payment apps aren\'t working or the big deal with Chase Pay, but c\'mon. I\'m not talking about incremental innovations here, but fundamental ones.\n\nThe rebuilding of whole financial markets using shared ledgers. The inclusion of 7 billion people in the financial network through mobile. Those are the big ticket items. Another user of Stripe is interesting, but it\'s not the massive change we can see coming downstream.\n\nSo why is this fundamental change going to take 1o years, at least? Because that\'s how long any major change takes to become mainstream due to ""the Waterfall Effect"".\n\nThe Waterfall Effect is exactly that: the cascade of flowing change from idea to implementation to acceptance to mainstream. And you have to remember there are many players in play here.\n\nStarting point\n\nIt starts with a new technology, such as the blockchain shared ledger protocol.\n\nThe technology then has to be built into something robust and new providers – Blockapps, Chain, Chainalysis, Case, Circle, Coinbase, ConsenSys, Epiphyte, Ethereum, Eris, LedgerX, R3CEV, Ripple, Symbiont, TradeBlock and more – are created to innovate and to allow this technology to be adopted.\n\nThen, the large incumbent technology providers start their programs to join these new innovators and bring them into an architecture that works for their bank clients.\n\nSome say the incumbent technology companies move too slow.\n\nIn fact, some believe that the real problem is not the banks\' legacy systems but their legacy providers, but hey, let\'s not go there. Eventually, the providers get it, and adapt and adopt the technologies into their frameworks and architectures.\n\nHitting primetime\n\nEventually it\'s ready for bank prime time.\n\nThen that\'s another story, as now the banks have to adapt and adopt the frameworks and architectures from their incumbent providers and innovative start-up partners.\n\nThat takes time, and different banks move at different speeds depending upon the use case and their ability to change.\n\nLet\'s say this takes about six years, and that\'s how long it\'s taken to get shared ledgers from Satoshi Nakamoto\'s white paper to serious use cases being adopted by banks as proof of concept (POC).\n\nThat\'s still a way off from POC to implementation and mainstream use. The latter is still 3-5 years away in many cases.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let’s say it takes a decade to get from the white paper to mainstream incorporation.\n\nConsumer change\n\nOK, so now we\'re getting somewhere, but we\'re still not there as the corporations and consumers haven\'t been touched yet. Often a bank can innovate and sometimes even innovate fast, but then their customers have to change too.\n\nCorporates will adapt and adopt a technology that will reduce costs and improve processing but, a bit like the banks and their incumbent technology providers, the corporates also have legacy systems and legacy providers who have to adapt and change.\n\nGive that another five years and then, finally, consumers can have the service. But do they want it?\n\nAccording to many of my bank friends, every time they update their bank apps with new features and changed interfaces, their Net Promoter Score (NPS) goes down.\n\nThis is because 80% of customers don\'t like change. Shoot.\n\nSo the consumer takes another year or two before they switch onto the new cheaper, faster service. And hey, we\'ve got there.\n\nReaching acceleration\n\nBut this waterfall effect – new technology, startup developers, incumbent providers, main markets of usage, clients of main market users and, finally, customers of clients – means that any major technology change takes at least a decade to maybe three decades before it gets mainstream.\n\nAfter all, the mobile telephone was invented in 1973 but took almost 30 years to become mainstream.\n\nWe talk about how things are moving faster – apps go viral in seconds – but these are things that move once you\'ve changed the underlying architecture, and that\'s why groundbreaking change takes decades.\n\nOnce you’ve made the change however, everything that sits on that underlying architecture can move at light speed.\n\nThis is why the blockchain will take another decade before it is mainstream, as it\'s changing the foundations, the rails, the roads of finance.\n\nIt’s not just a bit of froth on the foundation, like most of the apps out there.\n\nThis piece originally appeared on the Financial Services Club Blog and has been republished with the author\'s permission.\n\nBirthday cake image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Ou pas. Après les enquêtes de Wired et Gizmodo, qui pensaient avoir identifié l’inventeur de la monnaie électronique, dans l’ombre depuis sa création en 2009, de nombreux éléments ont fait surface. Ils semblent indiquer que l’Australien Craig Wright se trouve au centre d’un hoax gigantesque. Reste à savoir s’il en est l’auteur ou une victime.\n\nLes conclusions des deux sites américains s’appuyaient sur plusieurs éléments :\n\nDes emails soi-disant piratés dans lesquels Wright affirmait être le créateur de la monnaie, mais aussi des procès-verbaux de son avocat dans lesquels il répétait la même chose.\n\nDes billets techniques sur son blog semblant pré-dater le lancement de Bitcoin.\n\nUne clé cryptée qui avait l’air d’être authentifiée comme étant celle utilisée par Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nClé antidatée et CV pipeauté\n\nOui mais voilà, il semble bien que de nombreux éléments ont été fabriqués, au cours d’une tromperie qui a été préparée pendant plus de deux ans. Dans le détail :\n\nMotherboard a prouvé que la technologie utilisée pour créer la clé cryptée de 2008 n’existait pas en 2008. Il semble donc qu’elle ait simplement été antidatée, ce qui n’est pas très compliqué : il suffit de changer la date de son PC.\n\nLes billets du blog ont été édités a posteriori, sans doute pour rajouter des éléments à propos de Bitcoin.\n\nSi rien ne prouve que les emails ont été fabriqués, c’est toutefois possible. Des experts réseaux peuvent créer des courriers qui semblent 100 % authentiques, y compris leur en-tête. La seule vérification qui permettrait de trancher serait d’obtenir les archives des serveurs des fournisseurs d’accès à Internet pour savoir à quelle date ils ont vraiment été envoyés.\n\nUne enquête de Forbes a montré que Wright a inventé les deux doctorats sur son CV. Et le fabricant de superordinateurs SGI a démenti avoir vendu deux modèles à l’une des entreprises de Wright, comme ce dernier l’affirmait sur son site.\n\nJeudi, un billet a été publié sur un blog Linux depuis l’adresse satoshi@vistomail.com, utilisée par l’inventeur de Bitcoin depuis de nombreuses années (mais qui pourrait avoir été piratée en novembre dernier, c'est donc à prendre avec des pincettes). Il affirme : « Je ne suis pas Craig Wright. Nous sommes tous Satoshi. »\n\nLe compte du créateur vaut 500 millions de dollars\n\nDepuis 2009, toutes les tentatives pour démasquer le créateur de Bitcoin, une monnaie électronique désormais valorisée à plus de 5 milliards de dollars, ont échoué. En 2014, Newsweek pensait notamment avoir débusqué un ingénieur japonais de 65 ans retraité en Californie mais s'était royalement planté.\n\nIl n’est pas exclu que Satoshi Nakamoto soit un alias regroupant plusieurs personnes. Si le feuilleton passionne, c’est notamment parce qu’un compte originel possède encore 10 % des bitcoins en circulation, soit 500 millions de dollars.\n\nEt Wright dans tout ça ? Personne ou presque n’avait entendu parler de lui jusqu’à présent. Un de ses anciens associés le décrit dans la presse australienne comme un « homme qui vit dans son monde ». Selon Wired, les ajouts à son blog datent d’avant mars 2014, ce qui semble prouver que la mise en scène a été préparée pendant au moins deux ans. S’il s’agit d’un imposteur, il semble en tout cas avoir une patience infinie."", 'Short domains have always been valuable, but if you’re a company today and want to own a short domain name, your price just became a lot higher. And I mean a lot.\n\nThere is a market unfolding that very few know about, and tens of millions of dollars are trading hands monthly. Over the last two years, China has become the largest buyer of domain names, resulting in what is likely the biggest story in domain-name investing since the Internet began.\n\nChinese investors (and other domain prospectors) have been buying up numeric and short-character dot coms faster than Adele can say “Hello.”\n\nGeorge Kirikos, a well-known follower of ICANN policy, tweeted on November 14th: “136 of the 676 2-letter .com domain names are now owned by Chinese registrants, breaking the 20% barrier (20.1% to be exact).”\n\nThe same week, TheDomains.com published an article noting Verisign just reported that 3.2 million new dot-com domains were registered in the previous three weeks — more than the entire second quarter.\n\nWhat was once a market where domain name owners would hold and wait for a company to approach them is now quickly becoming a market with mass liquidity — the missing piece of the puzzle for the last decade.\n\nThree-letter dot coms consisting of traditionally lower-quality letters often sold in the $10,000 to $15,000 range. Now they are catching upwards of $50,000, and more.\n\nThis new demand for domain names is not an easy thing to understand.\n\nWestern investors are still trying to catch up and understand the Chinese market. Letters of lower use in English — q, z and j for example — are considered premium in China. Vowels, on the other hand, are not premium. Any domain name with a vowel or a v is considered less valuable.\n\nRon Jackson, the publisher behind DNJournal, regularly reports sales like Give.com, Amber.com and Classic.com. However, the sales reports today are now almost nothing but short domains. In fact, 9 of the Top 10 year-to-date sales (all over $500,000) are less than three characters.\n\nEven the preferred way to communicate with buyers has changed. Most transactions are agreed upon in China through QQ — the largest instant messaging system in China, but rarely known in North America. Tracy Fogarty of eNaming explains; “Most offers are sent through QQ. Maybe 1 in 10 people use email, even fewer use the phone.”\n\nThis explosion has made a lot of people extremely wealthy, but it’s not who you may think. Many industry veterans missed the boat — trying to understand how to analyze what’s attractive to Chinese buyers; others doubt the long-term value of this market, and many are doubling down for what they see ahead. All of the elements for a Hollywood story are happening right now.\n\nOne great site that tracks market activity is Chaomi.cc, showing sales history in charts (much like forex, gold or other commodities). As Hong Kong domain-name investor Franky Tong explained, “chao mi“ literally means fried rice, but also means domain speculation. This shows how Western investors may have their hands full analyzing data.\n\nOver the last year, some incredible new milestones in domain-name registrations have been achieved.\n\nAll five-number dot coms are now registered.\n\nAll five-number dot nets are now registered.\n\nAll six-number dot coms are now registered.\n\nAll seven-number dot coms beginning with three eights, ending with three eights or having almost any repeatable pattern are now registered.\n\nAll four-letter .orgs with premium Chinese letters are now registered.\n\nEven with eight-number dot-com domains, of which there are one hundred million, it’s getting hard to find any of the popular patterns that don’t include a zero or four.\n\nIs This A Fad Or History In The Making?\n\nChina is a vastly different culture than America, especially when it comes to wealth. Chinese citizens are raised learning strictly about the importance of savings and building wealth versus our consumer-based society.\n\nShort domain names are commodities now.\n\nWealthy people love to invest and Chinese investors are hungry for portable wealth. The rise of Bitcoin was something quickly linked to China markets, but it couldn’t hold once Chinese regulators put a stop to the acceptance of deposits in Chinese Yuan. Bitcoin also has (and still has) liquidity issues for many owners outside of North America.\n\nDomain names are different. First, the rarity of domain names is perfect and measurable since there are only so many two-letter dot coms, only so many three-letter dot coms, so many four-numbers with an 8, etc.\n\nIn fact, what seems like millions of domain names can easily be broken down into premium domain names that have a far lower supply than Bitcoin ever did.\n\nThis new demand for domain names is not an easy thing to understand, but some of those who do have acquired almost generational wealth over the past year. Others have made hundreds of thousands.\n\nShort domain names are commodities now. Fads come and go, and this certainly does not seem like a fad in my opinion. Will there be ups and downs? Sure. But we are likely witnessing history in the making — a new history for an established marketplace that never saw this coming.\n\nMaybe you should have ponied up and paid for that domain name after all.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', 'BargainFox publishes an infographic that shows that in 2016 the value of Bitcoin will continue growing.\n\nOnline shopping service BargainFox has recently published an infographic that indicates that the value of Bitcoin will continue growing in 2016.\n\nThe infographic says that the biggest Bitcoin exchanges have grown rapidly over the year 2015. For instance, Singapore-based OK Coin has grown 847%; BitStamp has doubled within the year, reaching 160%.\n\nThe market has managed to move $289 million worth of Bitcoin on a day-to-day basis, more than Western Union ($216m) and closing in on PayPal ($397m).\n\nThe use of Bitcoin as a payment method by online and offline merchants is highly increasing, supported by Bitcoin payment service providers such as Coinify, Europe’s leader in processing wide range of digital currency payments.\n\nAn insignificant 1% is charged for BitPay premium members compared to the major credit card networks that range between 2% and 6%. Certainly this has contributed to the rise from 65,000 merchants accepting Bitcoin to 100,000 plus. Besides, retailers like TigerDirect reveal that Bitcoin prevents fraudulent chargebacks that are very common with customers using credit cards.\n\nFurthermore, giants like Microsoft, Expedia, Time Inc., NewEgg and Overstock have started to accept Bitcoin as a payment option and many others corporations are following the lead. August 2015 recorded 70,000 transactions via BitPay.\n\nAs the demand has increased, so has the venture capital funding the user-friendly applications, Bitcoin ATMs, exchanges, and other technology. For instance, back in 2012 only $2 million was invested in the industry. So far, in 2015 this has reached $469 million.\n\nLike many other technologies, Bitcoin had come a long way until it reached a widespread adoption by financial companies across the world. In the meantime, such events as the closure of the Silk Road black marketplace and the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange, negatively affected the digital currency. However, the industry is still growing, with Bitcoin being widely used for microtransactions, international remittances, smart contracts, securities trading and machine-to-machine transactions.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

12/13/2015,"['“Should I or should I not invest in bitcoins?” A question that bothers us all, especially when the price is going higher. The Bitcoin price has not exactly been the poster child for stability, however, and potential investors in Bitcoin have been skeptical about spending money on the sector, especially when there is frequent fluctuation in its value.\n\nIt is not possible to control the price fluctuation, but one can definitely consider a few positive factors that may help them decide whether it is worth investing in bitcoins or not. When it comes to Bitcoin, there are a few hard truths which are not likely to change, one being the total number of bitcoins that will ever be created. Satoshi Nakamoto and others who might have been responsible for the development of Bitcoin have capped its supply to 21 million, irrespective of the number of miners, hashing power and Bitcoin users on the network. Limited supply means that the value of a bitcoin over time can go only one way, and that is upwards.\n\nIn one of our articles last week, we covered some of the notable happenings in the Bitcoin sector this year. It shows that Bitcoin and its underlying technology is being increasingly adopted by many industries, and even governments have started recognizing Bitcoin as something more valuable that what they had earlier thought. Increasing use of Bitcoin for transactions, investments and other technical purposes will push the demand, which will be further-fueled by the gradual fall in the rate of generation of new bitcoins. Increased demand and usage will contribute to increased bitcoin value to the tune of over $10,000 by 2025, according to some enthusiasts.\n\nREAD MORE: Bitcoin in 2015, a 5 Minute Read\n\nThe price volatility associated with Bitcoin might act in its favor by increasing the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network. The increase in transactions can be attributed to active Bitcoin traders, who will make use of the fluctuation to gain profits. Bitcoin is also the only cryptocurrency to have a huge mining pool and a lot of users on the network, making it virtually impossible for any other cryptocurrency to take its place.\n\nAll these factors show that Bitcoin will not be easily affected by external influences, and the technology behind Bitcoin will hold good for a long time. It is now up to the investors to decide whether they would be interested in investing in the cryptocurrency, or not.', 'Is there more to the current blockchain hype than there was to the Bitcoin hype of the past? 7 myths debunked. 7 reasons to be skeptical.\n\nTwo years ago, Bitcoin was at the peak of its hype cycle. The digital currency’s value skyrocketed. Increasing tenfold in 4 months, it passed the $1,200 mark, the price of an ounce of gold at the time.\n\nThen, after a couple of security breaches and scandals such as the collapse of the largest exchange Mt. Gox in 2014, Bitcoin’s value fell down to $200. The speculation frenzy came to a halt. So did the VC’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin-based business models.\n\nIn 2015, the hype machine started humming again. The new hype revolves around the idea that Bitcoin may not be viable as a currency, but the blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that records bitcoin transactions would have a formidable potential on its own. As research reported on by Coindesk shows:\n\n“On the question of whether “the blockchain can thrive without bitcoin”, 73% of the 55 respondents asked this question said they believe it can.”\n\nThe dream is that of an open self-administered transaction network in which multiple processors are forced to collaborate and validate transactions –eliminating any risk of double spend or reversal- without central supervision. Such a system could be used to manage any type of asset transaction or contract history in a decentralized fashion, without a central authority. It could apply to stock trading, property title registry, voting, crowdfunding…\n\n7 Myths Debunked & 7 Reasons to be Skeptical\n\nAs stated above the idea of blockchain has a great appeal and seems worth investigating. However, there are major reasons to be skeptical.\n\nOne suspicion would be that a blockchain-based system, if at all workable, would be a downgraded version of the Bitcoin’s blockchain and, as such, would require as many safeguards and controls as current regulated systems.\n\nI’ve singled out 7 myths about blockchain and bitcoin, the debunking of which should inform a healthy skepticism.\n\nMyth Number 1 : Blockchain as a decentralized ledger can be split from bitcoin in the Bitcoin system\n\nMost people who say this argue something along the lines that bitcoin failed as a currency but the blockchain worked. From there, they jump to the conclusion that the blockchain in isolation of the bitcoin could build a decentralized transaction system. This is quite as absurd as saying that we could get water from oxygen alone because we can isolate oxygen from hydrogen in H20.\n\nIn reality what makes Bitcoin’s blockchain strongly decentralized is the specific bitcoin encryption algorithm and bitcoin network protocol which determine the way bitcoin processors (“miners”) compete to verify and validate (“hash”) bitcoin transactions.\n\nThere are other distributed ledger systems than Bitcoin’s, such a Ripple Lab’s and Ethereum’s. Ethereum develops its own “blockchain”, but the Bitcoin blockchain is, to this day, the only one that is truly decentralized without the need for consensus or supervision.\n\nMyth Number 2: Bitcoin is a currency used by 10’s of 1,000’s of legal merchants.\n\nOne heard this two years ago when it was even less true than today. I remember a presentation by a Bitcoin vendor showing beautiful pictures of Afghan weavers who allegedly were using bitcoin to sell their carpets worldwide! Magic carpets, for sure.\n\nIn reality, ignoring illegal business which has dramatically declined since Silk Road was busted:\n\nBitcoin as a currency was and is probably still used to over 80% for speculative hoarding.\n\nThe legal merchants listed as “accepting bitcoins” don’t. At best, they allow you to spend your bitcoins at a partnering facility which converts them into dollars – exchange costs and risks are on you.\n\nMerchants started to “accept bitcoin” just to check how it works, to look cool, or to get media exposure.\n\nMyth Number 3 Bitcoin transactions are processed in real time\n\nIn reality, Bitcoin transactions are processed in blocks and it takes more than 10 minutes between blocks. The Bitcoin network currently handles less than 2 transactions per second, against several thousands for Visa. You can check the stats on blockchain.info.\n\nMyth Number 4 Bitcoin transactions are “nearly free”\n\nIn reality, the true cost of Bitcoin processing is not charged to users. It’s invisible to users, and, for the most part, not charged to merchants either –for now. Here is why:\n\nMiners who process transactions are currently making over 99% of their revenue (currently around $1.3 million a day) from generating (“mining”) new bitcoins. This will last until the planned 21 million bitcoins have been mined – which should happen in 2140. It is unclear how the bitcoin transaction cost will evolve after that.\n\nTransaction processing per se is minimally rewarded by the network with a small amounts of bitcoins that currently represents less than 1% of the miners’ revenue.\n\nBut only the total miner rewards can justify the high $ investment and operating costs of mining (see myth Nr 6 below). Hence, the real cost of transaction should take the total mining cost into account, i.e. $7.64 per transaction, for an average transaction of $824.\n\nWhen exchange commissions are added, this cost is not negligible.\n\nMyth Number 5 Bitcoin is more secure than other transaction systems\n\nBitcoin’s protocol has been highly resilient against attacks.\n\nHowever, like in any transaction system, security breaches have been caused by human failure and fraud. In 2015 alone:\n\nBitpay lost nearly $2 million in a phishing attack.\n\nBefore that, a Canadian bitcoin exchange was forced to shut down because its databases had been compromised.\n\nHong Kong-based bitcoin exchange MyCoin disappeared with $387 million in client funds\n\nBitstamp temporarily stopped trading because of one of its operational wallets was compromised.\n\nMyth Number 6 Bitcoin’s ecosystem is decentralized\n\nBitcoin Hashrate Distribution Source Blockchain.info Dec 3, 2015\n\nIn fact, bitcoin mining is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few mining pools. The four leading ones, including 3 from China, control nearly 75% of the hashing. Large mining farms artificially limit themselves so as not to ruin the illusion of democracy. But smaller miners and mining pools, such as DigitBTC earlier this year, are driven out of business.\n\nThe reason for this oligopolistic dominance is that, by design, generating Bitcoins through mining becomes harder as the number of bitcoins increases. Only larger players can afford the higher capital investment (specialized hardware) and operating costs (e.g. electricity) that mining requires. Bitcoin is de facto controlled by a handful of quite opaque players who would, if they wanted to, have the 51% majority that would enable them to modify transaction rules.\n\nNote that the wallet market is also very concentrated with Coinbase and Blockchain.info the largest operators claiming together more than 50% market share.\n\nMyth Number 7 Bitcoin is idealistic and non-profit\n\nIn reality, billions of dollars of investments are riding on Bitcoin. Firstly, there is a cumulated $5 billion worth of bitcoin currency. Secondly, there are billions of dollars invested in mining, exchanges and wallet operators.\n\nRecent examples:\n\nCoinbase raised more than $100 million.\n\nGoldman Sachs invested $50 million in a bitcoin start up call Circle.\n\nAnother bitcoin startup hardly out of stealth mode, 21 Inc, raised $116 million from the best VCs in Silicon Valley.\n\nEven if only to rescue their Bitcoin investment, most investors want their Bitcoin business to “pivot” to blockchain.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nBitcoin is undoubtedly a brilliant, extraordinary invention and currently has the only truly decentralized ledger technology, i.e. blockchain. But what makes it so strong seems to make it also impractical. When reality hits, the Bitcoin network appears less efficient, more easily centrally controlled and more opaque than many regulated transaction and payment systems.\n\nWhether another version of the blockchain or decentralized ledger could do better without adding layers of consensus or regulation that would put them of a par with competing technologies remains to be seen.\n\nIt’s not going to be easy – they’ve already tried for quite some time.\n\nTherese Torris is an entrepreneur and consultant in eFinance and eCommerce based in Paris.

This needs to change for people to even want to consider using bitcoin. As the bitcoin debit card markets mature, this is likely to change. “With accessibility, no one really thinks about how they get their everyday currency. No one thinks they are going to go to an exchange before going down to the grocery store. This is a huge friction for people. As people continue to receive bitcoins in natural ways as a currency, receiving wages or getting paid for goods, bitcoin will become more accessible, especially for the unbanked. “With relative stability, Bitcoin is just a lot more volatile vs. the dollar, making it a bad store of value in comparison. However, in certain countries, like Vietnam, Venezuela and Argentina, Bitcoin actually is relatively stable. This creates opportunity for adoption in these countries and as this occurs, it should provide stability to the system that is needed to penetrate markets with more stable currencies.”\n\nBitcoin as a Payment Rail\n\nFor Jonathan the major issue with Bitcoin as a payment rail has to do with liquidity which he says can be broken down into two segments. On liquidity he says:\n\n“the first is that the current market cap is 6.5 billion USD of value. The current forex markets trade a 5.3 trillion USD of value a DAY. It is literally impossible for bitcoin to support this market at it’s current market cap, especially since a majority of bitcoins (78% according to a 2012 survey) are not being openly traded, but rather stored. The second liquidity issue occurs with geographical markets. Unlike the US, Europe and China, many of the other bitcoin markets are highly susceptible to price movement for relatively small transactions sizes (I’m talking on the range of $10,000).”\n\nHe believes that for Bitcoin to rise as a payment protocol, more local market makers must be introduced into the industry. Saying that it is a good thing that with Bitcoin, there is an easy access to the true exchange rates, meaning that it is a lot easier for these market makers to engage in arbitrage, and incentives that will likely help to solve this problem in the future.\n\nBitcoin as a Ledger\n\nLastly, there is looking at Bitcoin as a ledger. Mr. Chester’s view is that the idea is to tokenize an asset on bitcoin to leverage the blockchain for it’s ledger capabilities. He says;\n\n“The main issue here is that the token only acts as a clearing mechanism and not a settlement mechanism. For instance, I have a pink slip for a car. I tokenize it on a satoshi. Now I send that satoshi to a friend for $10,000, but I keep the pink slip. Who now has ownership? It’s an interesting question. What if I gave the token to a friend instead of him paying for it? What if I was hacked and the token was taken away from me? I have not done the legal research, but I would guess that a judge would most likely say the person in possession of the pink slip still owns the car.”\n\nTo Jonathan, the separation of clearing and settlement is a major issue. As he believes that for this capability, there is room for improvement, and if it does not change soon, there may even be a way for a different blockchain to take over this aspect.\n\nWe hope that you liked this article.

The island hosts an old Templar Fort that used to belong to the king of Portugal over 100 years ago. Before the fall of the monarchy, he sold the island to a British family of Templar lineage, who held the island in trust for over a century. The British family in turn sold it to a Portuguese art teacher who now goes by the name of Prince D. Renato Barros.\n\nThere are four citizens: me, my wife, my son and my daughter,” he told The Guardian in 2014.\n\nWell, this week Pontinha—soon to be renamed Atlantis—made Bitcoin its national currency, according to Prime Minister Joby Weeks, setting the stage for many developments to come in the transformation of this historic port into the anchor of an international, libertarian potential citizenry. In an interview with DisrupTek.info, Weeks shared the tale of Atlantis, how it came to his attention and, what lays ahead for the young country.\n\nAmong the potential of this sovereign state is the possibility of setting up a banking branch and anchor to corporations that can legally represent cryptocurrency-fueled companies across the world and cyberspace. Weeks also suggested the possibility of an e-passport as discussed with Susanne Tarkowski of BitNation and an e-residency, following in the footsteps of Estonia.\n\nOn top of that, Weeks wants to establish an Ambassador Club and campaign such that citizens of Atlantis can have contacts all over the world. A prerequisite to be an Atlantis Ambassador is to have a spare room for other visitors and Ambassadors to stay at on occasion, building a kind of AirBnb for its own citizens.\n\nTo learn more about the tale of Atlantis, check out DisrupTek’s interview with Joby Weeks, or contact Weeks on Facebook.', '\'Big four\' professional services firm Deloitte made headlines earlier this year when it revealed it had become the latest in a long line of mainstream brands to take an interest in blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, Deloitte is perhaps distinguished from its peers due to the fact that it is seeking to help clients, including mainstream financial institutions, launch pilots and proofs-of-concepts with the emerging technology.\n\nTo better understand Deloitte\'s path to this new market, CoinDesk spoke to Iliana Oris Valiente, business development manager and co-founder at Rubix – a service it calls a ""one-stop blockchain software platform"".\n\nLaunched after approximately a year of R&D, Oris Valiente said, Deloitte is now equipped to help business clients she argues are just starting to wake up to the future possibilities of what could be built with blockchain technology.\n\nOris Valiente told CoinDesk:\n\n""Mostly clients will drive their agenda based on their industry and based on their goals and needs. We match that with our understanding of the technology and how we think it could impact their business, not necessarily their legacy business today but what their business could look like in the next two-to-three years.""\n\nOris Valiente said that a key driver of interest in the service is the desire for financial services providers to determine how the technology could mature so they can best develop a forward-looking business strategy today.\n\nCrowded field\n\nHowever, Deloitte is not alone in the trying to serve this market and its competitors in the space include tech giants like Microsoft and rival PriceWaterhouseCoopers, both of whom have launched similar initiatives.\n\nGiven this climate, Oris Valiente was careful not to divulge specifics about current projects, though she did hint at some of the organization\'s work.\n\nFor example, Oris Valiente told CoinDesk her team is currently working with a client in the healthcare sector to build a prototype to enable payments.\n\n""[The client\'s] expectation is that these POCs [proof-of-concepts], [will] serve as a reminder or a signal to the rest of the organisation, their respective organisation about what is to come ... and what the technology is capable of supporting today,"" she said.\n\nOther areas of possible focus, she added, would be looking at applications in the loyalty space and supply chain sector, both areas she said where automation could change existing business practices.\n\n""One aspect of the technology that I think is going to have a significant impact is the automation of certain procesess ... by providing the transparency and the open ledger, if you can drive efficiencies in existing processes that\'s a very clear value proposition of the technology,"" she said.\n\nMultiple protocols\n\nPerhaps most notable is the fact that Rubix is offering its clients access to multiple distributed consensus platforms.\n\nAccording to Oris Valiente, Rubix has focused most of its work to date on the Ethereum protocol, which she argued offers functionality that is of particular interest to enterprise clients.\n\nLaunched in 2014, Ethereum is an open, public blockchain like bitcoin, only it aims to enable the rise of a new class of decentralised applications due to its inclusion of a Turing-complete scripting language.\n\nThe comments come as many financial incumbents are experimenting with both the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain in an effort to understand the distributed financial technology stack.\n\n""Often what people are describing when they talk about the power of blockchain technology, they are referring to what Ethereum has been able to build, without realising it\'s Ethereum,"" she said.\n\nA key advantage of the Ethereum protocol, Oris Valiente said, is that its clients can use the protocol to ensure products being built are capable of intra-connectivity amongst various other platforms.\n\n""At the end of the day our role as a team is to do what is best for the client and if the client comes to us and has a use case that makes perfect sense to be built on top of the bitcoin blockchain ... we are happy to do that,"" she said.\n\nBitcoin\'s value\n\nOris Valiente also addressed the interest among mainstream financial providers in private or permissioned blockchains.\n\nIn doing so, she was quick to point out that the efforts are perhaps problematic in their approach. For example, many major financial institutions have expressed reservations about bitcoin as a digital currency, and their intent to pursue projects that don\'t use, or limit access to, similar digital tokens.\n\nHowever, Oris Valiente noted that tokenisation is required in order to maintain decentralised ledger systems. ""You can\'t have the blockchain without a token, of course,"" she explained.\n\nOris Valiente further voiced her belief that there is potential for digital currencies to succeed in the future:\n\n""I do think that there is a future for digital currencies especially the notion of a state-sponsored currency or currency in emerging markets as an option for the unbanked to get access to participate in that world.""\n\nShe added that she believes there are hurdles that need to be overcome if any digital currency is ever to reach mainstream adoption in developed markets.\n\n""Is virtual currency going to become very dominant in an established markets where we already have options as consumers and various alternatives? Maybe not because of the lack of accessible tools and the various hurdles for people to apprehend the technology,"" she added.\n\nNew markets\n\nIn this light, Oris Valiente said clients are looking at blockchain technology as a way to build new products in emerging markets that would have been previously impossible to create or distribute.\n\nA perfect example of this, she said, is in the insurance industry, where the technology could be used as a way to eliminate the need for consumers to have trusted relationships with insurers.\n\n""All of a sudden if you think about blockchain technology, as an enabler of something like a peer-to-peer insurance platform in emerging markets ... well, you\'ve just created a new product that brings value to an entire community and moves towards financial inclusion and poverty alleviation,"" she said.\n\nBut how far are we from such applications?\n\nOris Valiente said believes that this transition is likely going to take place once industry initiatives move past the exploratory phases and begin to consolidate.\n\n""Once you start seeing all those little Lego pieces coming together into a comprehensive network, I think that is when you are going to start seeing a lot of very meaningful impacts,"" she said, concluding:\n\n""But that\'s definitely a couple of years out.""\n\nPete Rizzo contributed reporting.\n\nPuzzle piece image via Shustterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Would it provide a better solution than that provided by the government?\n\nIt is a great undertaking to integrate Bitcoin and Blockchain technologies into the real estate industry.\n\nOur CoinTelegraph correspondent talked with the president of the International Bitcoin Real Estate Association, Ragnar Lifthrasir about the potential of Blockchain technology for development in the real estate industry. His team wants to create a digital alternative for government land and title registries.\n\n“If a buyer and a seller of a property both agree to use Bitcoin Blockchain solutions instead of government solution, nothing will stop them as long as they both agree to use it”, states Ragnar Lifthrasir, the President of International Bitcoin Real Estate Association.\n\nRagnar shared with CoinTelegraph his ideas about the exact ways of integrating innovations into the real estate industry to make it safer and simpler.\n\nCT: How exactly is the Blockchain being integrated into Real Estate? Will it be simple for common users to work with these technologies?\n\nRagnar Lifthrasir: There are three ways we could use Blockchain technology in the real estate: purchasing real estate; escrowing real estate; recording the transfer of ownership of real estate onto the Blockchain.\n\nRight now, none of those being commonly done but we are working on it to change the situation.\n\nOne of our goals is to make Bitcoin easy to use for common users. We are working on creating companies and applications that would use Bitcoin in such a way that users would not even know they’re using it.\n\nRight now our company focuses on real estate titles. We plan to do the record of ownership and put it on the Blockchain. In that case the users wouldn’t know they are using Bitcoin at all. It would be similar to uploading documents to DropBox or GoogleDrive – all simple and familiar.\n\nIn terms of escrow we are working on it but that’s a little bit in the future. That would be very similar to making a bank transfer. You put in the amount you need to transfer, then buy the needed amount of Bitcoins and then the Bitcoins will be put into escrow. So it will be very similar to transferring via banks.\n\nCT: How exactly does the Blockchain help prevent title fraud?\n\nRL: Bitcoin technology can prevent fraud with real estate and titles in two ways. First when you upload your documents to the Blockchain, you prove that you are the first person with that document. And when time comes to reproduce that document – to transfer – you would be able to prove that you have the document in your possession by rehashing it. So basically Blockchain helps by creating a document that is difficult to forge.\n\nWe’ll imagine though that someone is still able to forge the document. In that case Blockchain will help you prove you are the first person to have the document. That leads us to the second part of what you need for greater security. And that’s the actual transfer mechanism.\n\nFor that, we work to provide the Colored Coin solution similar to the one Overstock and Nasdaq are using. Those two companies are using colored coins to settle security features. But we’re working on using it for real estate assets. Even though trespassers might be able to produce a fraud document they still won’t be able to transfer the property unless they are in control of the private keys. So it’s important not only to have the actual secure document that shows your ownership but also have private keys for transferring that property.\n\nOur organization works on the provision of both solutions.\n\nCT: What obstacles are there in building a Blockchain based and non-government sanctioned land/title registry? Could the government interfere with your plans?\n\nRL: Right now the obstacle is not the technology. We have all the technology we need and we have had it for at least a year. The real obstacle is simply building the system and then getting people to use it. It’s like with any other business. We need to build it and prove that it’s good and we need to explain people why exactly it is good. We need to develop the right application and establish the right price for it. And that’s just what we’re doing right now. We’re trying to create the product and then we’re going to take it to the market. And charge the right price for it.\n\nThe challenge is simply to convince people this new technology is better.\n\nThe government doesn’t have a reason to hinder us because we’re not talking about money. The governments are always worried about money laundering and using money for the wrong purposes and money fraud. They don’t have as much of a concern with real estate. Our strategy is not to try to convince government to use Blockchain in their land registry.\n\nOur strategy is to create a product with wide solutions for the industry. And once enough people in the industry will use it, the government would have no choice but to put up with it. If a buyer and a seller of a property both agree to use Bitcoin Blockchain solutions instead of government solution, nothing will stop them as long as they both agree to use it. So you can just imagine that if every big company decides to use it than it will work.\n\nPeople will probably still do it with the government for legal reasons but they can go to the government after they have used Bitcoin. Bitcoin is so much easier and faster. People can establish everything on the Blockchain and then go to the government for all paper work whenever they want to.\n\nWe’re not trying to replace the government. We’re just trying to create an alternative for people to choose. It’s the same like Bitcoin currency. Bitcoin is not trying to replace fiat currencies but it’s offering a digital alternative. And we’re trying to offer a digital alternative for government land and title registry. But you can have both.\n\nCT: Are you the first company to provide Bitcoin and Blockchain solutions?\n\nRL: We’re not the first, but I can tell you what other companies are doing wrong. A lot of people in Bitcoin community don’t understand real estate. For example, there are few companies that are trying to use the Blockchain for real estate titles. But they don’t really understand the mechanisms of real estate; they don’t understand who pays for what. That’s the first problem.\n\nThe second problem is that companies haven’t just found enough other individuals or companies to transact with. I think that’s really been a challenge and we’re trying to fight it; we’re trying to connect people so they could work together.\n\nThe technology is right there. People and companies in Bitcoin space are out there right now building applications and businesses. They are trying to convince other companies or individuals to use Bitcoin. And the problem is that they refuse to use it because they have never done it before.\n\nWhat the companies need to do is to find other people in the industry and work together to bridge that. People thought that they are just going to convince non Bitcoin users to use Bitcoin. And that is wrong. I think companies who are going to start using Bitcoin in real estate need to connect with other real estate professionals and companies. They need to have a conversation together and then discuss how to do a great work in integrating Bitcoin and Blockchain technologies and how to go forward from here.\n\nWe hope that you liked this article. We recommend you get acquainted with our ratings of the top blockchain companies and cryptocurrencies.', 'The Bytecoin team—who are developing an untraceable and open decentralized cryptocurrency—has released a new version of its e-commerce solution called Bytecoin RPC Wallet, which allows merchants and online businesses to accept incoming payments secured with modern cryptographic algorithms that are “impossible to hack.”\n\nThe RPC Wallet was launched specifically to provide online businesses access to the Bytecoin platform directly through a cryptocurrency wallet interface, and offers an application program interface (API) which can be easily integrated by merchants and businesses. The new release enhances previous security measures, features a new tool which allows users to process various blockchain transaction confirmations, and enables direct blockchain operations.\n\nAs of December 9, 2015, RPC wallet users can easily backup or transfer wallet keys to another server using simple command terms. This allows businesses and merchants to easily migrate their servers and e-commerce stores securely and efficiently. Furthermore, the newly-integrated transaction tool allows users to “validate transaction parameters, lock the outputs for a transaction, calculate a hash etc. before sending the transaction into the network,” explained Harry Ullman of Bytecoin Public Relations.\n\nOver the past few months, Bytecoin has released multiple solutions such as the user-friendly payments management feature called Aggregate Multi-Addresses to help online businesses and merchants.\n\n“Before Bytecoin 1.0.6, simply assigning a new address for every new user would be not feasible. The technologies used to guarantee payments privacy make [the] blockchain much more sophisticated than in other cryptocurrencies. One has to check all outputs with his private keys in the whole blockchain to identify outgoing and incoming transactions for this address,” explained the Bytecoin developers.\n\nThrough the launch of such services and features, the Bytecoin team worked to improve user privacy by ensuring anonymity of all domestic and international transactions since 2012.\n\n“The RPC Wallet has already seen significant updates, when the Aggregate Multi-Addresses were implemented,” said Ullman.\n\n“Bytecoin’s RPC Wallet is an essential part of [our] Business Platform. And the main goal set by development team is ensuring stable operation of the platform and improving usability and flexibility for third-side developers, who use the Platform capacities for augmenting their financial services,” he added.', 'Laura Noonan, Investment Banking Correspondent DECEMBER 13, 2015 3 Internet groups will soon pose an even bigger threat to traditional banks, the chief executive of BBVA has warned. Regulators should ensure a “level playing field” between incumbents and newcomers, said Francisco González, chairman and chief executive of Europe’s sixth-largest bank by market value. Banks and online companies have been fighting to dominate areas from payments, where Apple Pay and Samsung Pay are vying with Chase Pay for supremacy, to virtual currency, where Goldman Sachs is taking on bitcoin. “A new competitive landscape is in the making and it is just a matter of time before the giants of the net also enter banking in a more decisive way,” said Mr González. “We think regulation should provide a level playing field that allows for faster development and more competition while ensuring consumer protection, privacy and security.” Federico Ghizzoni, chief executive of UniCredit, Italy’s largest bank, said the regulatory environment in which banks operated was making it harder to compete with the wave of new and more nimble competitors. “Banks must have the scale to invest significantly in new technology, yet they must also avoid the too big to fail trap, which would put them at odds with regulators and investors alike,” said Mr Ghizzoni. UniCredit is trying to square the circle by investing €1.2bn in digitisation over the next three years while cutting 18,200 jobs and moving out of unprofitable businesses. FT Series Beyond Banking The FT looks at the turmoil facing banking as the industry struggles to adjust to tougher regulations and the emergence of alternative lenders It hopes the digital spend will enable it to grant loans online within minutes — the process takes 48 hours now — and use big data to get closer to customers and offer more tailored products. Mr González agrees the data that banks accumulate are a “true advantage” as they square up to new competitors with lower cost bases and the ability to respond more quickly to consumer trends. “Our aim is to become a data-driven company and we are ready to take on the challenge,” said Mr González, whose 14 years in the top job make him one of Europe’s longest-serving bank chief executives. Online providers offering everything from loans to deposits, payments systems and foreign exchange services have been growing rapidly across the globe but some bankers privately say the threat they pose is not as apocalyptic as painted by some. Those bankers say that while online companies are targeting some of the revenue streams, they are not looking to replace their entire business lines or become as heavily regulated as full-service banks. Listen to the Banking weekly podcast: A review of the year in banking', 'Jim Brunsden DECEMBER 13, 2015 0 The European Union has long sought a seamless, integrated, EU banking market. It even has a mission statement of what one would look like. “Under full financial integration, banking markets would efficiently allocate resources to the most productive investment opportunities across the euro area, without frictions in the flow of funds across borders,’’ says a report published by the European Central Bank in April. The reality in Europe today is a long way from that pure vision. Banks often still have a strong bias towards investing in their home markets, and face political pressure to do so. The financial crisis has also taken its toll. According to the ECB, the level of integration in euro area banking markets still lags behind that of the pre-crisis era. At the consumer level, as anyone who has tried to move to another European country without setting up a local bank account can attest, the complications of cross-border retail banking can still be considerable. This matters because the economic stakes are high, especially in the euro area, where regulators see an integrated banking market as a crucial step to underpin the euro. If credit markets are fragmented it weakens the intended impact of monetary policy decisions taken by the ECB. The breakdown of cross-border investment in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis was cited by the ECB as a key justification for extraordinary measures such as its targeted long-term refinancing operations and asset purchase programmes. For Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at think-tank Bruegel, a wave of cross-border mergers of European banks could provide the most realistic short-term route to a more integrated banking market. “There is a desperate need in the euro area for risk sharing, so that it is better able to absorb shocks,” he says. Other than cross-border M&A, he says, the main ways to achieve this would be either to have fiscal transfers from richer to poorer EU nations, an idea rigorously opposed by Germany and others, or a push to eliminate regulatory barriers to cross-border investment. While the EU is seeking to tackle these barriers through a policy programme known as the Capital Markets Union, Mr Véron says that it is likely to take a long time to bear fruit. “The only way to get the sort of risk sharing that the eurozone needs in a realistic timeframe is to have cross-border integration of the banking system,” he says. An extreme example of the cracks in Europe’s banking market emerged in 2012 when Germany and Italy clashed over demands from German banking supervisors that Italian lender UniCredit not transfer funds away from its German unit. There is a desperate need in the euro area for risk sharing, so that it is better able to absorb shocks Nicolas Véron Michel Barnier, the then EU commissioner in charge of financial regulation, said at the time that his officials were monitoring the situation, but did not outright challenge the practices, which ran counter to EU rules on free movement of capital. Officials say such problems should progressively become a thing of the past, at least within the euro area, because of the EU’s decision in 2013 to turn the ECB into the currency bloc’s top banking supervisor, so taking key decisions out of national hands. The ECB took on the role in November 2014. According to Mr Véron, an ECB-led push for a better functioning single market also would have financial stability benefits. “At this point we have national banking markers with massive too-big-to-fail issues,” he said. “If the ECB manages to make the eurozone a single banking market then the too-big-to-fail problem becomes much less acute.” At the same time, at street level, the lack of a well functioning single market for banking is all too apparent. Particular bugbears include the reluctance of banks to grant mortgages for houses based in another country, or to people whose main residence or source of income is abroad. The Commission has pledged to embark on further measures to remedy what is says is a “fragmented” financial services market — a problem that goes beyond banking. It has pledged new measures to address this including by exploring how to unleash the potential offered by new digital technologies. According to a Commission policy document, the average consumer in Europe faces “a lack of transparency and comparability of financial services, biased financial advice, excessively complex financial products, unfair contract terms, and misleading or aggressive selling practices”. These problems “can be compounded when consumers attempt to purchase products across borders”.']"
12/14/2015,"['Bitcoin has had one its most interesting weeks since the beginning of 2015. The scandal of Craig Wright, Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s deployment of its own blockchain network, and Ukraine’s largest bank’s announcement of a Bitcoin-based commercial payments network have lured in a lot of attention to the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAccording to Google Trends, in fact, Google searches (keyword) for Bitcoin have increased by a staggering 157% in the past week, recording a yearly high.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto and Craig Wright\n\nRenowned tech media networks Wired Magazine and Gizmodo claimed that they have found the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Journalists from Wired and Gizmodo alleged 44-year-old Australian “computer scientist” Craig Wright to be Satoshi, claiming that his PGP public key and blog posts led to Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nHowever, these claims were later proven false by Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell, computing firm SGI and educational institution Charles Stuart University (CSU). Maxwell provided evidence to prove the linking of PGP keys was forged, SGI denied any connection to Wright and CSU—the university from which Wright supposedly obtained his doctorate—stated that Wright was never a PhD candidate at the university.\n\nThe alleged claims by Wired and Gizmodo—as well as Wright’s various criminal offenses including tax evasion and fraud—led to a national investigation, involving federal government and law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe international scandal of the “true identity” of Satoshi led to a spike in the interest of Bitcoin. After the claims by Wired and Gizmodo were falsified, the trend of Bitcoin on Google plummeted, almost halving in a few days.', 'In light of the recent attacks in Paris that led to the deaths of 129 Parisians, the European Union (EU) and other international powers, including the United States and Russia, have been gathering to discuss how to curb the threats of terrorism, specifically ISIS or ISIL. Being mentioned in those discussions is the controversial topic of virtual currency with an emphasis on Bitcoin and its role in terrorism financing. But why are government officials so afraid of Bitcoin as a possible avenue for terrorist “donations”?\n\nWhen you think of Bitcoin as a currency, there are a number of reasons a criminal may consider it in a money laundering application. The strongest one being you can instantly send Bitcoins anywhere in the world, nearly for free, and without any intermediaries to freeze the funds. That makes it a very efficient tool for terrorists trying to transport money faster than physical cash. Similar to cash, there is no identity attached to any Bitcoin transaction either. But, there are two glaring attributes that make Bitcoin an ineffective method for financing terrorism.\n\nThe first attribute is actually it’s lack of anonymity. While no virtual currency transactions have a direct link to identity, each transaction is displayed on a public ledger (called the blockchain) and remains there forever. This means every transaction and every chain of transactions can be traced. Furthermore, Gavin Anderson, the Chief Scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, notes that, “Unless you are very careful in the way you use Bitcoin (and you have the technical know-how to use it with other anonymizing technologies like Tor or i2p), you should assume that a persistent, motivated attacker will be able to associate your IP address with your bitcoin transactions.” This means a Bitcoin transaction by itself, without the use of additional technology, does not fully hide a user’s identity. Instead, it can be used to identify the sender’s IP address, and ultimately, who they are. Even cash is not that transparent.\n\nThe second attribute involves the ability to exchange Bitcoins for local currency. It’s not as simple as walking up to the exchange booth found in any international airport. If you look at the bitcoin exchange infrastructure in Syria and Iraq specifically, it is quite limited. A terrorist receiving bitcoins in these countries would either have to create a bitcoin-based goods and services market, or they would have to exchange the bitcoins for currencies in more fluid markets like the United States, Europe, or China.\n\nIn the latter scenario, once the bitcoins are liquidated, they would still need to move the funds into the Islamic State controlled territories. Since the money at this point would be a traditional currency interacting with the traditional banking systems, all movements could be easily traced and subject to governmental oversight and regulation. This seems very inefficient when the original funds most likely originated in the ISIS controlled states and neighboring territories to begin with.\n\nThis weakest part of the bitcoin chain from an anti-money laundering perspective is the liquidation link, where exchanges convert funds into and out of bitcoin. If there was zero regulation in place, these exchanges would be a hotbed for criminals seeking to launder funds nearly anonymously. However, there is already strong regulation implemented to address identity issues around these weak links such as the Payment Services Directive administered by the European Commission.\n\nSome view the current actions of the EU in regard to Bitcoin regulation as a rushed, panicked reaction. By getting the type of regulation just right, using a rational and calculated response, the EU will actually help foster innovative companies within the industry to actually curb Bitcoin as a terrorism currency. For instance, financial institutions are required to take a risk-based approach, performing deeper due diligence and transaction monitoring on higher risk clients and transactions. Government regulation can implement a similar strategy, having baseline requirements of registering and reporting transactions and increasing burdens, such as the acquisition of bonds and requesting government permission for the releasing of new products, based on higher transaction volume.', 'The mechanical advancement behind Bitcoin can possibly engage the current financial world, not simply disturb banks out of presence as some have anticipated, according to a previous Wall Street executive.\n\nBlythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset Holdings told CoinTelegraph:\n\n""The Blockchain is the financial test of our time. It will change the way that our financial world works.""\n\nContending that Bitcoin\'s hidden innovation has the chance to enhance settlement dormancy and framework security for firms, Masters said the business sector for financial Blockchain applications will at last be ""measured in the trillions.""\n\nWhile advancing her own firm—which she said overcomes any issues between the Blockchain advancement world and financial administrations—Masters said that major financial firms ""have all started to commit a lot of time and exertion"" to finding out about the innovation. She beforehand served as an official at JPMorgan Chase.\n\nBrian Kelly, Founder of Brian Kelly Capital told CoinTelegraph:\n\nIn the previous six months, ""everyone understood that Bitcoin is more than a currency, Everyone had their ‘aha’ minute, and financial specialists with a large number of dollars to spend are beginning to perceive how it can be utilized.""\n\nWhat Is The Blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is the thing that makes Bitcoin work: It serves as an unalterable record of all Bitcoin exchanges. To ingrain confidence that nobody can double-spend their currency (one of the boss worries around a computerized token instead of physical bills) this record should be totally secure from altering. It accomplishes this deed—and has so far demonstrated to be unhackable—by consistently adjusting with servers over the globe.\n\nCoinTelegraph reported nine months back that speculators and technologists progressively think the innovation supporting Bitcoin—""Blockchain""— could at last be more progressive than the currency.\n\nIt is that unalterable—and straightforward—record-keeping capacity that makes Blockchain the potential establishment of any number of different advances.\n\nWho Cares About The Blockchain?\n\nCurrently, more than twelve major banks and tech firms have jumped into the field, including Seagate, Nasdaq, Overstock, IBM, Samsung, UBS, Barclays, Banco Santander and Intel—to give some examples.\n\nLevels of duty shift among firms. Seagate put resources into Ripple Labs to wind up a ""dynamic member"" in the Blockchain space, a firm official told CoinDesk. In a proof-of-idea paper, IBM and Samsung said Blockchain innovation could include an essential level of security to gadgets in the developing ""Web-of-Things"" space, for instance ""savvy"" machines.\n\nOn the account side of the mathematical statement, Nasdaq dispatched a ""venture wide activity"" to influence the Blockchain. This is relied upon to start in the not-so-distant future by utilizing the innovation to fabricate the value administration record on the Nasdaq Private Market stage, the organization said.\n\nNasdaq CEO Robert Greifeld told the Financial Times he needs his organization to be a pioneer in the field. Be that as it may, there will be rivalry, as a few fund firms have all looked for presentation to the Blockchain.\n\nThe financial group was moderate to come around to this innovation—which guarantees to give security to cash and data exchanges without a trusted go between—yet they are starting to hold onto it as an expense sparing instrument, Kelly said.\n\nThe Blockchain tech has even pulled in the consideration of Virgin\'s Richard Branson. Jeff Garzik, one of five Bitcoin center designers who have assumed control upkeep of the innovation from strange maker Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nGarzik, who now works full-time at Dunvegan Space Systems, anticipated the horde uses of the Blockchain will in the end shape the base for a spate of new advances, much like Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)—the fundamental correspondence dialect of the Internet—does now.\n\n""You don\'t have a discussion today about TCP/IP: This is the lowest layer of a money network,"" Garzik told CoinTelegraph. ""You\'re not going to say \'We should embrace bitcoin,\' you\'re going to say \'We should utilize this money layer foundation.\' You\'ll discuss the money web, or something of that nature, you won\'t discuss the Blockchain itself.""\n\nWill Bitcoin Survive?\n\nIt\'s a typical abstain among a bit of the business group that they adore Blockchain, yet not Bitcoin—inferring the famously unstable currency is an unsound venture in the meantime its innovation could change the world. Bitcoin aficionados, on the other hand, underline that you can\'t have one without the other.\n\nIn spite of the fact that that is in fact untrue—another Blockchain could be founded on another currency—almost every origination of the innovation requires some kind of token to work. Furthermore, Bitcoin is unrealistic to be overwhelmed: Its mass appropriation and long history means it would be a few requests of size more secure than any upstart coin.\n\nSeparate Blockchains have as of now appeared for different applications, however most occasionally attach back to the Bitcoin information bind keeping in mind the end goal to expand their own security.', 'Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin’s price is forming an interesting bullish structure, which is pointing towards more gains in the near term.\n\nThere is a support trend line formed on the 4-hour chart (data feed from HitBTC), which may act as a catalyst for an upside move.\n\nA short-term breakout pattern (triangle) is forming on the hourly chart (data feed from Bitstamp).\n\nBitcoin’s price looks set for an upside move, maybe above $500 if buyers remain in control, and if the price stays above a support trend line on H4.\n\nBuy Dips?\n\nBitcoin’s price—after trading towards $300—started a new bullish trend, and looking at the current 4-hour chart, there are enough reasons for the bulls to push the price above $500. There is a major bullish trend line formed on the 4-hour chart (data feed from HitBTC), suggesting that sellers are struggling to take the price down.\n\nThe price has already crossed the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the last drop from the $518 high to the $312 low once. So, there is a high probability of it trading back towards the last swing high, which is $518. The 4H Relative Strength index is well-supported and above the 50 level, which is a positive sign.\n\nLooking at the data feed from Bitstamp, the price is still trading in a strong uptrend inside its ascending triangle pattern on the 1-hour chart. If the price manages to clear the triangle’s resistance area, then it could be considered as an early sign of a move towards $500. Buyers need to also break the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the last drop from the $467 high to $403 low.\n\nLooking at the Indicators\n\nMoving Average – The 100 hourly simple moving average (SMA) is perfectly aligned with the highlighted support trend line, pointing to it as a buy area.\n\nRSI (Relative Strength Index) – The hourly RSI is above the 50 level, which is a bullish sign.\n\nIntraday Support Level – $430\n\nIntraday Resistance Level – $450\n\nCharts from HitBTC and Bitstamp; hosted by Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The Node Pole is on the edge of the Arctic Circle, where cooling can be as simple as opening a door.\n\nIt\'s barely six months since KnC announced its last data center, which is already up and running.\n\nKnC employs a continuous construction process for its data centers: Staff began installing and powering up the first racks while contractors were still bolting together prefabricated parts for the adjoining section.\n\nThe ground hasn\'t been cleared for the next one yet -- ""There are trees there now,"" Cole said -- but he\'s confident it will be ready by March, or perhaps February -- four weeks after the chips are delivered for the machines that the data centers will house.\n\n""In our game, timing is everything,"" he said.\n\nKnC\'s game is bitcoin mining, the process of validating successive blocks of data in the blockchain, the distributed ledger used to record bitcoin transactions, by calculating a cryptographic hash. Miners are rewarded with bitcoins for each block successfully validated, which means the more processing power they can apply to the task, and the more efficiently they can operate it, the greater the reward.\n\nAs demand grew for mining capacity, or the computing power dedicated to processing the blockchain, KnC hit on the idea of developing custom chips to speed up the hashing operation. It combined these application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) into mining rigs and sold them to would-be bitcoin miners, then later began hosting and operating the rigs itself. Earlier this year it introduced a new generation of mining chips built with a 16-nanometer, 3D FinFET production process more often used to make high-performance ARM processors for mobile phones.\n\nBitcoin mining is a numbers game. The bitcoins that can be won aren\'t ""free money,"" as there\'s a capital cost involved in building the equipment, whether you have one processor core working on it or millions, and operational costs, primarily electricity.\n\nMiners seek to optimize the performance of their rigs, measured in hashes per second, and reduce their energy consumption. When KnC takes delivery of a batch of new, more efficient ASICs, it wants to get them up and running as soon as possible.\n\nThe new data center, like the last one, will have a power consumption of 20MW, but Cole won\'t say how many hashes per second it will perform.\n\n""The hashing capacity is commercially sensitive,"" he said, and depends on many factors, including the design of the mining chips and the quality of the batch used.\n\nThe computing resources dedicated to bitcoin mining worldwide have a capacity of about 633 petahashes per second, and about 5 percent of those resources are controlled by KnC, according to blockchain.info, which provides statistics on bitcoin transactions.', 'Airbitz, a mobile wallet that includes a location-based directory of companies that accept bitcoin, has officially announced a partnership with Fold, which will allow users to purchase Starbucks and Target gift cards at a discount directly inside the wallet.\n\nFold, which was launched in 2013, allowed users to purchase Starbucks cards at a 20 percent discount using bitcoin. While only Starbucks and Target are currently supported, Fold is looking to integrate Whole Foods, CVS, and Home Depot, according to a recent interview with Fold Founder Matt Luongo.\n\n""We’ve also been looking at Walmart, CVS, and Home Depot,"" Luongo said. ""The top 30 retailers in the U.S. are all in our sights.”\n\nWhile the addition of Fold into the Airbitz ecosystem could be seen as a simple way to streamline the gift card exchange process, Airbitz CEO Paul Puey has a larger vision.\n\n""Airbitz aims to secure digital assets across multiple applications, starting with our own,"" Puey said. "" While we started with digital currencies, we\'re already securing login credentials with BitID. With the launch of the Fold integration, we\'re now securing gift cards, just a new type of digital asset.”\n\nBitID, a decentralized authentication protocol developed by Eric Larchevêque, allows users to replace passwords with bitcoin private keys and avoid the account creation process entirely.\n\nFold is not the first company to resell unused gift cards – Raise, Cardpool and ABC Gift Cards all purchase and sell discounted gift cards online. Gyft, one of Fold\'s main competitors, accepts bitcoin as well. Samsung even released an update for its Samsung Pay app last week that allows users to purchase ""50 popular merchant gift cards"" directly in the app for face value.\n\nHowever, by integrating Fold\'s service directly into the Airbitz mobile wallet, both companies are hoping to reduce friction and streamline the process for their users.\n\nBut as these services become more popular, some websites are beginning to crack down on the sale of gift cards as they can serve as a way to launder money from stolen credit cards.\n\nBitify, an Australian bitcoin and litecoin marketplace, recently banned the sale of all digital gift cards as some buyers ""claimed that [the gift cards were] purchased with stolen credit cards.""\n\nFold says it has put in place preventive measures to deter the resale of illegally obtained gift cards.\n\n""We\'ve built a best-in-class fraud prevention system to protect ourselves and our customers,"" said Luongo.\n\nThis partnership has been in the works since the beginning of 2015 when both Airbitz and Fold were participating in accelerators in Silicon Valley (Plug and Play and Boost VC, respectively).\n\n“ I’ve been promoting Fold since 2014 when almost no one had heard of the service,” said Puey.\n\nAirbitz is available for free on both iOS and Android. To take advantage of this new partnership, create an Airbitz wallet and navigate to the \'More\' tab bar on the bottom of the screen. From there, choose the ""Buy/Sell Bitcoin"" option and select which retailer\'s gift card you\'d like to purchase. Load up your bitcoin, swipe to send, and a preloaded barcode will appear, which you can scan at checkout.\n\nFold works at any location that accepts U.S. gift cards. This includes Canada, Mexico, Australia, Ireland, Hong Kong, Great Britain, Macau and Spain, according to their website.', 'A service called BitGreet is letting users spread more than just seasonal cheer – it lets senders attach bitcoin to its Christmas e-cards.\n\nThe commission-free service was launched last Christmas and it has already seen some 1,000 cards delivered, according to its co-founder.\n\nBitGreet is a service from CoinCorner, a bitcoin exchange in the Isle of Man. Co-founder Daniel Scott said:\n\n""We were thinking of a fun way to try and increase bitcoin adoption in the office one afternoon. It was nearly Christmas at the time and we were in the festive spirit so we came up with the idea of a digital bitcoin Christmas card.""\n\nHow it works\n\nTo send some Christmas cryptocurrency, users first select a card design from the BitGreet website. They then enter the receiver\'s email address and the amount of bitcoin they wish to send.\n\nSenders then see a checkout page, similar to merchant checkout pages from BitPay or Coinbase, telling them the amount of bitcoin they have to deposit to a CoinCorner address.\n\nYou don\'t have to be CoinCorner customer to send a card with some bitcoin slipped in. Neither do you have to upload any data to satisfy Know-Your-Customer rules.\n\nAfter four confirmations on the blockchain, the recipient gets an email containing a link to a page that enables them to send the coins to the digital wallet of their choice.\n\nBeginners\' protection\n\nBitGreet has also built a \'clawback\' mechanism in case a sender made a mistake and wants to claim their coins back.\n\nEvery card sent contains a link to a page that lets the sender retrieve the coins. This only works, of course, if the coins haven\'t already been claimed by the receiver.\n\nThere is an additional caveat to using BitGreet: senders have to trust CoinCorner, at least temporarily, with the funds they\'re attaching to greeting cards. That\'s because the funds sit at a CoinCorner-controlled address while they wait to be claimed by the receiver.\n\nScott addressed the issue:\n\n""Yes, we hold them in escrow, so to speak.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Much is happening in the bitcoin mining data center world, and not all of it is good. While two major players in the space, BitFury Group and KnC Miner, announced big expansion projects, another player, GAW Miners is going down in flames, the latest in its story being official fraud accusations by the SEC, which called GAW a “Ponzi scheme.”\n\nWhile some bitcoin mining data center capacity is leased from traditional data center providers, most of the world’s blockchain servers run in massive warehouses quickly outfitted with high-capacity power and cooling systems but not nearly as much redundancy as designed into regular data centers.\n\nIf data center providers were somewhat weary of leasing space to bitcoin mining companies that offer mining services or host mining hardware before the shakeout that started last year, caused by a sharp drop in value of the digital currency, they are much wearier now.\n\nC7 Data Centers has sued mining company CoinTerra, which had defaulted on debt and stopped paying to the data center provider for services. CoinTerra also had a sizable deployment with CenturyLink, but CenturyLink was quiet about the 10 MW of capacity the mining firm leased from it.\n\nHere’s a roundup of this month’s developments in the bitcoin mining data center market:\n\nSEC Accuses GAW of Running Ponzi Scheme\n\nHomero Joshua Garza, also known as Josh Garza, and his companies GAW Miners and ZenMiner have been accused of defrauding investors via a simple Ponzi scheme, according to the SEC. Garza allegedly promised investors high returns from his cloud mining business but never built the scale of computing power he was describing to them, paying returns to existing investors using money raised from new ones.\n\nGarza told us in an interview last year that GAW, also known as Geniuses at Work, was operating 12 data centers at the time and that it was on track to making $150 million in sales annually. The company has been sued by the utility Mississippi Power for unpaid electrical bills, and a group of investors and customers have been pursuing legal action against GAW since earlier this year.\n\nKnC Building Fourth Sweden Data Center\n\nKnC Miner announced plans to build a fourth bitcoin mining data center on its campus in Boden, Sweden – a small town about 20 miles north of Luleå, home to Facebook’s massive European data center.\n\nKnC’s new data center will have 30 MW of capacity. The company has been expanding capacity at the site rapidly, first announcing a 10 MW data center in Boden in 2014, and then unveiling plans to build out another 20 MW the same year.\n\nBoden is home to another bitcoin mining data center operated by a company called MegaMine, which leases the facility from data center provider Hydro66.\n\nBitFury to Launch Liquid-Cooled Facility in Republic of Georgia\n\nBigFury Group said it will launch its third data center in the Republic of Georgia this week. This will be a 40 MW facility, where servers will be cooled using immersion-cooling technology by Allied Control, a company BitFury acquired earlier this year. The cooling system is based on a design by 3M, the company that supplies the dielectric fluid used in the system.\n\nThe cooling technology enables the company to pack up to 250 kW per rack while substantially reducing energy consumption of the cooling system, the company said in a statement.']"
12/15/2015,"['The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved a plan from online retailer Overstock.com to issue company stock via the Internet, signaling a significant shift in the way financial securities will be distributed and traded in the years to come.\n\nOver the past year, Overstock and its freethinking CEO, Patrick Byrne, have developed technology for issuing financial securities by way of the blockchain, the vast online ledger underpinning the bitcoin digital currency. The blockchain is essentially an enormous database that runs across a global network of independent computers. With bitcoin, this ledger tracks the exchange of money. But it can also track the exchange of anything else that holds value, including stocks, bonds, and other financial securities. Overstock has already used the blockchain to issue private bonds, which did not require explicit regulatory approval. Now, the SEC has told the company it can issue public securities in much the same way.\n\nSuch a system could eliminate the unnecessary middlemen who have traditionally controlled the market.\n\nPublic documents filed by Overstock show that the SEC has approved an amended Form S-3 that would allow the company to issue public securities via blockchain-based technology, and Byrne plans to announce the news this evening at a bitcoin conference in San Diego. It’s unclear when the company will actually issue a public security on the blockchain. “You can assume its high on our list of priorities for 2016,” Byrne tells WIRED.\n\nOverstock built its technology under the aegis of a subsidiary called TØ.com, and it plans to offer this “cryptosecurity” tech as a service to other businesses, so that they too can issue stock via the blockchain. Each business would need separate approval from the SEC, but Overstock could use the system to issue stock for a third-party before issuing its own.\n\nByrne believes the technology “can do for the capital market what the Internet has done for consumers.” It’s designed to provide a secure, transparent, reliable, and largely automatic way of tracking who owns a given security at any given time. And in Byrne’s mind, it could replace systems run by the New York and Nasdaq stock exchanges. Such a system could eliminate many of the middlemen who have traditionally controlled the market, and thanks to its technological precision, it could close certain market loopholes. “There are all kinds of ways to rig the market,” Byrne told WIRED earlier this year. “We want to make it un-rig-able.”\n\nTØ is now just one of several efforts to reinvent the financial markets via the blockchain. Even Nasdaq is looking at it. Nasdaq OMX, the company behind the Nasdaq stock exchange, is building a system that uses the blockchain to oversee trades in private companies, but the company says it could also apply similar tech to the public stock markets.\n\nFor Jeffrey Steiner, counsel with the international law firm Gibson Dunn, who specializes in blockchain technology, this project shows what the blockchain can do for so many markets. “It can not only ensure that there’s security in the transaction, but it provides a full record of ownership for things like corporate bonds and stocks,” he says. “It can increase transparency, reduce costs, and remove the middleman—in this case remove a [traditional] exchange or a broker.” He calls Overstock’s plan “very interesting” but notes this is new territory and the regulatory landscape can be tricky because there’s little precedent for such a thing. Indeed, many investors may be wary of using such a technology. Finance is a conservative industry, after all. But with so many outfits starting to build this kind of technology, including names like the Nasdaq, attitudes are poised to change.\n\nBeyond Bitcoin\n\nByrne is a protege of Warren Buffet, and he carries a PhD in philosophy, with a focus on economics and jurisprudence. He leans libertarian, has long made a crusade of reforming Wall Street, and sees bitcoin as something that can transform society in myriad ways. In early 2014, Overstock became the largest online retailer to accept bitcoin, letting consumers buy everything from smartphone cases to patio furniture with the digital currency. Byrne hails the technology as a way of freeing our money system from the whims of banks and big government.\n\nToday, bitcoin accounts for a tiny fraction of sales on the site, but Byrne believes the technology will continue maturing—and that blockchain, the technology behind the technology, will have an equally enormous impact on the stock market. A decade ago, Overstock fell victim to a Wall Street dark art called naked short selling, and Byrne believes a digital ledger can, among other things, close the type of loopholes that made naked shorting possible. Basically, naked shorting involves selling stock shares that don’t exist. Something like the blockchain can provide a way of tracking all shares, at all times.\n\nIn the fall of last year, Byrne revealed that Overstock was using blockchain technology to build a system that would allow the company to issue stock over the ‘net. And last spring, it filed papers seeking SEC approval for such an offering. As it turns out, Overstock had purchased a 25 percent stake in an outfit called PRO Securities, and the system will operate through this company. PRO Securities—now TØ.com—is an alternative trading system, or ATS, an alternative to central stock exchanges such as the NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange, and others. It’s regulated by the SEC, and in a government filing earlier this year, the company amended its charter to say it may handle trades in digital securities using technology related to the blockchain.\n\nA $954 Billion Market\n\nThe plan is to turn TØ into a business that can help other companies manage financial securities via the blockchain. And this already is happening. Beyond issuing private bonds, TØ offers tools that let companies lend and borrow shares through the blockchain. This is designed to remove the traditional middlemen overseeing the $954 billion stock loan market in the US—and close the kind of stock settlement loophole that allows traders to “naked short sell” shares they hadn’t actually borrowed.\n\nAccording to Overstock and TØ, some hedge funds and other outfits have tested this system. And TØ hopes to extend its blockchain technology into other parts of the market. In its filing with the SEC, Overstock said it could issue as much as $500 million in stock and other securities via blockchain technology, and though the initial offerings will be little more than a proof of concept, this points the way to something larger. “This could be a trend we see across the board—though there are any of a number of issues that would need to be ironed out,” Steiner says. “I’m sure Overstock will not be the last to do this.”', 'For Sex Industry, Bitcoin Steps In Where Credit Cards Fear To Tread\n\nAcross the country, law enforcement is cracking down on sex trafficking of minors by going after online escort ads.\n\nFive years ago, Craigslist was pressured to shut down its adult-services forum. The new target is Backpage.com — Visa and MasterCard stopped processing transactions with Backpage this summer.\n\nSome in the sex industry are getting around that by using the virtual currency bitcoin. That\'s the latest adaptation by an industry used to getting creative to avoid detection.\n\nAfter making more than 800 arrests off Backpage since 2009, Cook County Illinois Sheriff Tom Dart called a news conference to announce a victory this summer.\n\n""We want to commend both Visa and MasterCard for their civic responsibility, for so quickly acting when we talked to them. American Express has already done that. They\'ve now been narrowed down to where there\'s very little options for people who want to work with that website,"" Dart said.\n\nA version of this has played out before. The main site for escort ads used to be Craigslist. But under pressure from activists, Craigslist shut down its adult services forum.\n\nMany of those ads then migrated to Backpage.\n\nFor human rights lawyer Malika Saada Saar, who led the Craigslist action, that nimble pivot was a disappointment.\n\n""I am no longer willing to play a game of whack-a-mole with these websites. Until we start arresting buyers for statutory rape and putting them on the sex offender registry, Craigslist, Backpage or the next mainstream website will continue to be popular and used in a widespread way,"" Saada Saar says.\n\nBackpage, owned by a Dutch company, is fighting back. It\'s suing Sheriff Dart and making its ads free.\n\nIt won\'t provide revenue figures and an attorney for the company declined to comment.\n\nBackpage\'s free ads spurred a blizzard of listings, but free isn\'t always free. Advertisers who want to make their ads more prominent pay a premium.\n\nThat\'s where where bitcoin comes in. It\'s a cyber currency that\'s sold peer to peer. There\'s no central bank, but there\'s an online ledger where transactions are recorded.\n\nSome bitcoin fans hope Backpage\'s credit card obstacle might become bitcoin\'s boon.\n\nRay Youssef is the CEO of Paxful Inc. in New York, a website that sells bitcoin. He says ""the Backpage Effect"" drove in a whole new clientele.\n\n""I was getting calls from people and they were just calling me up begging me to help them and I said, \'OK, just log on, create an account,\' and they were like, \'Account where?\' They didn\'t even know what our website was. People were just passing around our number on social media,"" Youssef says.\n\nHe says these customers, many of them unbanked and not tech-savvy, found bitcoin clunky.\n\nTutorials sprang up to help this kind of customer on the Web, and in-person — gatherings like one near San Francisco publicized by the Bay Area Chapter of the Sex Workers Outreach Project.\n\nIn an apartment in a newly gentrified industrial area, a recent bitcoin workshop for Backpage ads gets underway.\n\nIt feels like a neighborhood meeting, with snacks and soft drinks. A tax attorney arrives with his PowerPoint.\n\nHe shows the group how to trade the virtual currency on their cellphones, and he points out they can also use bitcoin to reserve hotel rooms on Expedia.\n\nThose attending this session view the easy movement of virtual currency, and the difficulty of tracing it, as appealing. But for those trying to combat the sex trade, strangling the money flow to an industry this adaptable remains a challenge.\n\nSasha Aslanian is a correspondent for American RadioWorks, the national documentary unit of American Public Media.', '', 'Blockchain platform Setl has appointed former executive director of the Bank of England Sir David Walker as its new chairman.\n\nA financial markets veteran, Sir Walker has also served as chairman of Barclays, Morgan Stanley International and the Securities and Investment Board.\n\nHe is also a senior member of the G30 group, which elaborates and promotes progress in international payments and settlements.

BitPesa had used Lipisha as a way to offer M-Pesa as a payment option to Kenyan bitcoin buyers.\n\nCourt documents obtained by CoinDesk show that Judge Joseph L Onguto sided with Safaricom in the new ruling, dated 14th December, stating that Safaricom had grounds to suspend Lipisha\'s account based on the contract between the two companies and concerns it would lose its money transmission license due to BitPesa\'s work with bitcoin.\n\nNotably, Judge Onguto weighed in on whether BitPesa’s business would fall under the definition of a money transmission company, stating:\n\n""Suffice however to state now that when [BitPesa] states it is engaged in the business of accepting bitcoin from various countries of the world and exchanging it for local African currencies including but not limited to the Kenya shilling, then in my preliminary view the 2nd Petitioner is engaged in money remittance business.""\n\nOnguto pointed to correspondence submitted to the Court showing that, in the view of the Central Bank of Kenya, BitPesa\'s use of bitcoin meant that ""it could not use the words \'money remittance\' or \'money transfer\'"". At the same time, he highlighted a 2014 notice from the central bank stating that it does not regulate virtual currency activity.\n\n""The petitioners agree, while the respondent does not,"" he said, going on to state that the matter should be explored more thoroughly in a future hearing.\n\nBitPesa declined to comment on Onguto’s comments regarding money transmission, but the company told CoinDesk that it supports the ruling and is working with a firm called Airtel Money to offer services in Kenya as the case proceeds.\n\n""We are pleased with the High Court\'s ruling, which permits BitPesa to continue to fight Safaricom\'s wrongful and unlawful bullying,"" BitPesa said in a statement. ""The Court has not dismissed BitPesa\'s case, but rather has ruled only that BitPesa is strong enough as a company that it does not require access to M-Pesa to survive during the course of the case.""\n\nThe firm said that it is exploring next steps with its legal counsel and declined to comment further. A Safaricom representative was not immediately available when reached.\n\nThe ruling comes as the Central Bank of Kenya released a new advisory regarding digital currencies like bitcoin, stating that they are not considered legal tender – a publication that BitPesa suggested could emerge as a result of the case.\n\nThe central bank stated that ""no entity is currently licensed to offer money remittance services and products in Kenya using virtual currency such as bitcoin"".\n\n""CBK reiterates that bitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya.

Greater transparency provided by the “blockchain” technology — effectively a public ledger managed by a third party — would allow donors to track more effectively how their money was being spent, a CAF report found. “Charities always face issues in terms of managing trust,” said Rhodri Davies, head of the Giving Thought policy programme at CAF. “With blockchain, you will be able to see where the money goes and track your donation as it goes through the charity.” The financial services sector has been closely scrutinising developments in blockchain technology to see how cuts in transaction costs, as there is no intermediary to pay, can be applied to their businesses. Barclays, for example, has been working with Safello, a bitcoin exchange, as part of the bank’s small business accelerator programme. Barclays said that while the project was still at the exploratory stage, one of the possible spin-offs was to examine how charities could start accepting bitcoin payments. Peter Randall, chief operating officer of UK blockchain start-up SETL, said the charity sector could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the financial services sector’s investigation into the new technology. “A blockchain can be used to . . . reduce the costs of collection . . . very significantly. It is equally at home processing small amounts as well as larger donations.” “Nano-donations” — much smaller amounts of money — could become the way in which people donate in the future, said Peter Smith, chief executive of Blockchain, a provider of bitcoin software. “At the moment, you can’t really donate tiny amounts of money — and can’t send small amounts of money as well,” he said. “With bitcoin and blockchain, you could now [donate money to] pay schoolchildren a dollar for every assignment that they complete or a cent for every page they read in a book: you can incentivise reading. There are lots of really cool models.” In depth Bitcoin As interest in bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currencyFurther reading The Royal National Lifeboat Institution was one of the first charities in the UK to accept donations via bitcoin. So far the charity has raised just over £2,500 from 600 different donations — many at a much smaller level than usual. “We look at [bitcoin] as an online cash box,” said Luke Williams, project leader for bitcoin at the RNLI. Mr Williams said he was aware of the benefits offered by blockchain technology but it was not something the charity was considering at present. “There is great value in bitcoin and blockchain in terms of international aid and moving money internationally,” he said. “One bitcoin wallet is the same regardless of where you are in the world. You don’t have the same fees to transfer the money.” Sam Deere, of Giving What We Can, part of the Centre for Effective Altruism, said the transparency offered by a blockchain-based transaction system would lead to a greater number of people being able to trust charities with their money. “Donors can be confident that what they donate actually goes to the charity,” he said.

For an expanding number, in any case, the cryptocurrency is an apparatus for extortion.\n\nBitcoin has been utilized before as a part of ransomware—a sort of malware that limits computer access unless a payment is paid—however another report from digital insight firm Recorded Future points out how criminals are progressively taking interest in Bitcoin as a method of payment for several types of attacks.\n\nTyler Bradshaw, Solutions Engineer at Recorded Future told CoinTelegraph:\n\n""The reception of Bitcoin inside the digital extortion scene is going to keep on developing""\n\nThe Recorded Future report traces how a group called DD4BC unleashed distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks against organizations, conducting huge volumes of network traffic directed at an administration through a system of locations, the specific goal being to disrupt service for authentic users.\n\nWho Is Part Of These Attacks?\n\nThe attackers, whose name remains ""DDOS for Bitcoin,"" would undermine organizations with such network assaults, requesting a payout in Bitcoin in return for not continuing their attacks (In a September report, Internet services supplier Akamai uncovered that it had recorded 141 such attacks from the group).\n\nThe attention was drawn to the group after that report may have inspired copycat offenders, Bradshaw said. Another group called Armada Collective rapidly sprang up, utilizing the same strategy as DD4BC, and Recorded Future said it had yet found a few late Dark Web deals for data on the best way to direct comparable attacks.\n\nThe DDOS intimidation infrequently worked, as the attackers requested moderately minimal expenditure—as a rule somewhere around 10 and 200 Bitcoin, or $4,100 to $82,000 at the present exchange scale.\n\nA gathering calling itself Armada Collective—which may not be the one that initially claimed the name—seems to have increased the ante, demanding that three Greek banks all pay 20,000 bitcoins (worth more than $7 million at the time). Despite seeing disturbances in exchanges for a period, each of the three banks declined to pay the payoff and employed increased levels of security against any such future DDOS attacks.\n\n""Even so, the DDOS danger scene keeps on advancing. While digital extortion has been around for a long while, the appropriation of Bitcoin as a strategy for payoff will keep on pulling in new hackers into the DDOS space,"" the Recorded Future report finished up.\n\nTalking with CoinTelegraph, Bradshaw said he thought the obscurity generally connected with cryptocurrencies (of which Bitcoin is the most well known) ""is really alluring"" for those considering digital blackmail. Prior plans depended on financial balances or cash orders, he said, so crooks felt they were at more serious danger of being found by governments.\n\nWhy We Know Transactions Are Traceable\n\nBitcoin, in any case, is not even remotely an anonymous framework. Law enforcement organizations have on numerous occasions followed Bitcoin exchanges back to criminals. Former FBI Special Agent Ilhwan Yum traced 3,760 Bitcoin servers back to servers involved in the operation of illegal online commercial center Silk Road, and subsequently to the laptop of Ross Ulbricht.\n\nTo some extent on the basis of this evidence, a Manhattan court found that Ulbricht had been the genius behind the Silk Road, and hence found him guilty on seven counts—including being a ""drug kingpin."" He has been sentenced to life in jail.\n\nThat built-in audit trail has not prevented a few offenders from utilizing the computerized currency as a part of bold attacks; for example, those by DD4BC and the Armada Collective.\n\n""Maybe that is something that is somewhat misconstrued,"" Bradshaw said of authorities following Bitcoin. Still, he said, the moderately insignificant obstructions to transfers and the absence of individual identifiable data attached to Bitcoin addresses make it very tempting to hackers.\n\nAre you interested in bitcoin?

12/16/2015,"['If you have come into possession of Bitcoin or any other digital currency such as Ripple or Litecoin that is “convertible” to a real currency or can be used to pay for goods and services, it may seem virtual. But the Internal Revenue Service considers it very real and you need to account for it at tax time.\n\n“If you’re not doing the accounting [on your digital currencies], you are on the line for tax evasion or misfiling,” says Jake Benson, CEO and founder of Libra Tax, which offers accounting software for digital currencies. “The reason you’d want to account for your Bitcoin and the gains and losses is the exact same reason you need to do it when you trade stocks. If you don’t, you’re breaking the law.”\n\nAccording to IRS guidance notice 14-21, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are capital assets, similar to stocks and bonds. “That means that for Bitcoin, and any existing cryptocurrency, the framework that applies to gains and losses, and the taxation and accounting of capital assets applies to cryptocurrency too,” says Benson.\n\nHowever, since stocks, bonds and other capital assets are not usually used as an everyday payment mechanism the way that Bitcoin and virtual currencies are, that introduces some complications.\n\nHere are the seven ways you may come into possession and/or dispose of Bitcoin and other digital currencies and how you need to account for them at tax time, plus explorations of two major gray areas. (For expediency, the article will refer mostly to Bitcoin, but the rules apply to all virtual currencies.)\n\n1. Mining\n\nNew Bitcoin are being issued by the system roughly every 10 minutes by a process called mining. In mining, computers running the Bitcoin software around the world attempt to solve math problems and the first computer to come up with the solution adds the most recent transactions to the ledger of all Bitcoin transactions, plus receives the new bitcoins created by the system, called the block reward.\n\nIf you are a miner and win the block reward, you must record the fair market value of Bitcoin that day and mark that as an addition to your personal or business income. Also note the date and timestamp at which your coins were mined. Later, when you dispose of those Bitcoin, you will subtract the date of acquisition from the date of disposal, and you will be taxed a long-term capital gains rate on any Bitcoin you held for more than a year, and a short-term capital gains rate on any Bitcoin you held for a year or less. (The timestamp isn’t absolutely necessary, but is helpful to validate the order of multiple acquisitions or disposals within a day.)\n\nThe amount you pay in taxes on a long-term capital gain will depend on your income-tax bracket, while short-term capital gains are taxed the same as ordinary income.\n\n2. Minting\n\nMinting is when other digital currencies are created out of thin air. Then the company or person creating the protocol or technology behind this new virtual currency needs to record the same information: the fair market value of the new currency when the currency is created (usually zero), plus the date and time stamp at which the coins were minted. Again, the fair market value is counted as an addition to your income in the year it was minted. And the date of acquisition needs to be noted, so that you can determine whether you will pay a short- or long-term capital gains tax on it.\n\n3. Earning\n\nIf you receive Bitcoin via payroll, just as in mining, it’s treated as an income event. Again, record the date and the fair market value. Later on, you will pay short- or long-term capital gains tax when you dispose of it.\n\nHowever, if you earned the Bitcoin in exchange for goods or services, you can also record your basis as the value of the item that you received for it. For instance, if Bob does $2,000 worth of services for Alice, and Alice pays him 5 bitcoins, the total of which is, at press time, higher than $2,000, he can record his cost basis (the amount at which he received it) as $2,000. He will pay less in taxable income upon receiving the bitcoins, but then more in capital gains tax if the price has risen by the time he sells.\n\n4. Spending\n\nSpending Bitcoin, whether you’re buying a coffee or a Dell computer, is treated just like selling. You record a short- or long-term capital gain or loss, based on your original cost basis and your holding period. (While this may seem onerous, see “Deciding Which Bitcoin Is Being Disposed Of” below for how to record these details.)\n\n5. Tipping/Gifting\n\nWhat people commonly call tipping on the Internet does not fit the IRS definition. “The law defines tips in a special way that applies to a pretty small group of scenarios [and considers tips] regular wage data, basically applying to waiters and people in the service industry,” says Benson. “Even though people on the Internet call gifts back and forth tips, by the letter of the law, they actually fall into the category of gifting.”\n\nSo, when people send tips on the Internet via a service like ChangeTip, which allows people to send each other small amounts such as $3, $1 or $0.25, the sender of the tip is considered a gifter, and whatever gain or loss he has experienced is then transferred onto the receiver.\n\n“If I acquire it at $10 and it goes to $20 and I give it to you and it later went to $30 and you sold it, even though it only went from $20 to $30 in your possession, since I gave it to you, you inherit my holding period and cost basis,” says Benson. “At the moment you sold it for $30, you technically have to recognize the gain from $10 to $30.”\n\nHowever, in reality, very few people will know the cost basis and holding period of any tips they receive, unless the gifter tells them. For that reason, most recipients of tips should assume a cost basis of zero and recognize the entire tip as income.\n\nIf you send a tip, you can help out the recipient, by telling him or her your cost basis and holding period. However, few, if any, people are actually doing this. And since the recipient of a tip may then tip someone else with the same money before paying taxes on it, the cost basis and holding period would need to be transferred again from the original tipper. Since it’s possible that tips could actually change hands many times within a given year, it could be nearly impossible to track down this information. For any tips you still have at the end of the year, declare it all as income to pay the highest possible amount of taxes on it.\n\nIf you are gifting Bitcoin to someone, you will not pay taxes on gifts up to $14,000 per year per recipient. However, it’s best for the receiver if you tell her the cost basis and date of the acquisition, especially if you are gifting her a large amount.\n\nIf you are the recipient of a gift, you can ask the giver for the cost basis and holding period, but if you can’t find out, you should record it all as income.\n\n6. Trading\n\nLike the buying and selling of a stock, when you trade for Bitcoin, there’s no immediate taxable event, but you have to record the fair market value and the date. The taxable event occurs upon disposition — either when you sell it or pay with it.\n\nBecause this is a new industry, if you are trading, you should check with your exchange to find out if it issues a 1099-B report at the end of the year, which will identify your gains and losses. Among some of the major digital currency exchanges — ItBit, Coinbase and Gemini — itBit releases 1099-Bs to its users, Coinbase sends out “a specialized Cost Basis for Taxes report” plus has a partner integration with LibraTax, and Gemini’s CEO and cofounder Tyler Winklevoss said by email, “we will deliver to our customers the appropriate information prior to April 15, 2016 so our customers can comply with applicable federal tax law.”\n\n7. Donating\n\nIf you have appreciated coins that you’ve held for more than one year, you can avoid paying taxes on the gains by donating those coins to a registered 501(c)3 charity that takes Bitcoin (such as United Way, Save the Children, Greenpeace, BitGive and others) and getting a proper receipt. Then, you can write off the total amount of the donation. For instance, says Benson, “If you mined a coin worth $0 and it goes up to $500, and you donate that coin, you get to write off a $500 donation but you don’t have to report $500 in gains.” That reduces your taxable income. To optimize your tax payment, you should donate the most appreciated coins to avoid paying taxes on them and to get the greatest deduction.\n\nIf you would like to donate coins you’ve held short term, it’s best to convert them to another currency (like USD) and donate that instead. Then you’ll pay short-term capital gains on the sale, but you’ll be able to write off the full amount of the donation. (If you just gave the Bitcoin you’ve held short-term, you’d only be able to write off the cost basis, not the full amount of the donation, and if the currency has risen in a short time, then your deduction will be smaller than it could’ve been.)\n\nDeciding Which Bitcoin Is Being Disposed Of\n\nThe difficulty of all these rules is that, in any particular disposal scenario, you may not know which particular Bitcoin you are spending, tipping, gifting, donating, etc. “Think of [Bitcoin] as liquid. If you poured two Bitcoin into the same wallet/glass, it’s just mixed liquid and there’s no way to really separate those two glasses you mixed together,” Benson says.\n\nFor that reason, it’s more practical to use one of the two common accounting methods: last in, first out (LIFO), or first in, first out (FIFO). In LIFO, you always assume disposal of your newest asset or coin. In FIFO, you always assume disposal of your oldest.\n\nIndividuals can change their accounting method from year to year. So if the price of Bitcoin or your digital currency has risen over the year, LIFO is ideal. That will help minimize your gains and the taxes you will pay on them. If the price is falling however, then go with FIFO, because you can maximize your losses and claim a deduction, which will reduce your taxable income.\n\nBusinesses, however, can’t switch from year to year. They usually have to choose an accounting method and stick to it.\n\nAnother option is to use what’s called “specific share identification.” If your records are in good enough order, every single time you dispose of an asset, you can select the highest cost one to either maximize a loss (and your tax deduction), or realize a smaller gain (and minimize your tax). Benson’s software offers an option called Libra Optimize, which, instead of using LIFO or FIFO, will mathematically reduce your tax obligation using this methodology.\n\nGray Area 1: Wash Sale Rules\n\nThe IRS prohibits taxpayers from deducting from their taxes the losses of so-called wash sales, in which you sell a security to realize a tax loss but then purchase a replacement 30 days before or after that sale. Currently, wash sale rules do not apply to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but Tyson Cross, a tax attorney at Cross Law and founder of Bitcoin Tax Solutions, cautions that if the IRS does decide to apply wash sale rules in this area, it could do so retroactively. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the IRS is correct.\n\n“If you find yourself in a situation of having the IRS saying wash sale rules apply to you, you are free to challenge that interpretation,” says Cross. You would go to Tax Court and say you disagree with the IRS’s interpretation, leaving it for a judge to decide. Because the wording of the statute clearly applies only to stocks and securities, Cross thinks it’s unlikely the IRS will take that interpretation. But if it did, and a taxpayer disagreed and prevailed in court, “the IRS would have to ask Congress to change the wording of that statute, and that act would not be retroactive.” So if Congress ever changes the statute to apply wash sale rules to Bitcoin, that rule would only apply from that day going forward. (If a taxpayer prevails and Congress doesn’t rule, it’s not clear what that would mean for other Bitcoin-holding taxpayers. In some cases, the Tax Court decision could apply only to that taxpayer, and in others, it could make other taxpayers feel comfortable using the same interpretation. “You don’t get real resolution on tax matters until you go to the Supreme Court,” says Cross.)\n\nGray Area 2: Loss Of Bitcoin\n\nHow you should treat a loss of Bitcoin for tax purposes depends on the particular circumstances of your loss, so you should always consult a tax professional in these instances. However, generally, if you lose the private keys to your Bitcoin or have a hardware failure, you can deduct your losses under section 165 of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers casualty and theft losses.\n\nIn this case, the value lost would not be the current market value of your Bitcoin, but the amount for which you bought your Bitcoin. Then, you would take $100 off that number and then reduce that by 10% of your adjusted gross income. So if your AGI is $50,000 and you lose Bitcoin for which you paid $5,000, you cannot deduct a loss.\n\n“If the exchange loses your coins, that’s a little messier,” says Cross. “It might implicate theft, and the theft situation is more complicated to qualify for. It needs to be an illegal act … and it’s very difficult to prove that theft actually happened. Oftentimes, people running the exchange have excuses and they say it was a hack, so it’s hard to hammer down the details, especially since these things are occurring in far-off jurisdictions.” Plus, as in the case of Mt. Gox, it’s uncertain where the coins are and if they will be recovered. However, if you want to qualify for theft, try to make a reasonable case that your coins were stolen and that you cannot retrieve them, and document your proof carefully.\n\nA recent decision (Pilgrim’s Pride) in the Fifth Circuit Court, which covers Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, involved stock, but offers an alternative that could have implications for Bitcoin. A company had shares of stock that had declined significantly — roughly $100 million to $20 million. The company decided to abandon its shares of the stock, because it was financially more advantageous tax-wise for the company to claim a $100 million loss than to keep the $20 million and claim an $80 million loss. Plus, it allowed the company to avoid limitations on capital losses that say you can only deduct $3,000 a year in capital losses.\n\nSomeone who had bitcoins at Mt. Gox could formally abandon their bitcoins by sending notice to Mt. Gox that they relinquish their right to their coins and forever waive any claim. Under the logic of Pilgrim’s Pride, they would then be able to take an ordinary loss reduction on their tax return for the amount for which they purchased their bitcoin, and that would be free of both the capital loss limitation that says you can only deduct $3,000 a year in capital losses as well as the casualty loss limitation that requires you to decrease your deduction by 10% of your AGI and $100.\n\n“The big caveat here is that this decision came out of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, so it’s only binding for people in [Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi] and the IRS may disagree with you,” says Cross. “If you don’t live in the Fifth Circuit, it’s a gamble.”\n\nIf usage of digital currencies continues to grow, the IRS may clear up some of these gray areas for all Bitcoin-holding taxpayers.', 'The Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia has advised its citizens not to use digital currencies such as bitcoin.\n\nThe Armenian central bank told regional news service ARKA last month that, in its view, the use of digital currencies should be avoided due to a lack of regulation in the industry.

The company cites “rigorous testing,” with results for measured power efficiency on average ranging between 0.055 joules per gigahash to 0.07 joules per gigahash. These numbers are also unequalled in the bitcoin mining industry.\n\nWith the chip, BitFury deemed the innovation to usher in the “exahash era,” a time when the total Bitcoin mining network hashrate reaches and exceeds 1 EH per second. 1 exahash = 1,000,000 gigahashes.\n\nIn a press release, BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov said:\n\nWe are very excited to launch mass production of our super 16nm ASIC Chip…We understand that it will be nearly impossible for any older technology to compete with the performance of our new 16nm technology.\n\nLower Power Needs\n\nAlong with its increased power efficiency, the new BitFury chips can run with a power supply voltage of 0.35V, the company confirmed, with the static part of the chip functional at 0.28V.\n\nThe company also states that every new 16nm Chip will deliver a minimum of 100 GH/sec while averaging in a range about 140 GH/sec with air cooling. BitFury further claimed that the chips can achieve up to 184 GH/sec with the company’s third-generation immersion cooling technology.\n\nBitFury added it will be partnering with Global Unichip Corporation (GUC) to mass produce the new chips.\n\nIn a statement, Jim Lai, the president of GUC stated:\n\nWe have worked closely with BitFury’s experienced IC designers and we are glad to assist BitFury achieve this outstanding result.\n\nIt was March 2015 when BitFury revealed its 28nm ASIC chip after progressing from its 55nm chip at the time. The 28nm chip will be used in BitFury’s new Georgia-based bitcoin mining farm, a project in which the company is investing a total of $100 million. The data center, to be built in Georgia’s capital city of Tbilisi will also make use of the miner’s new 16nm chips.\n\nAlso read: Interview With BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov: New Bitcoin ASIC Chips On the Horizon\n\nBitfury CEO Vavilov cited the unique position the company is in with regards to the production of the high-efficiency chips and added:\n\nAs a responsible player in the Bitcoin community, we will be working with integration partners and resellers to make our unique technology widely available, ensuring that the network remainds decentralized as we move into the exahash era together.\n\nIn recent times, BitFury has also made headlines after recruiting a former White House staffer and aide to President Obama, Jamie Smith, as the company’s global chief of communications.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and BitFury.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'While the world looks to label Bitcoin for all of the things it isn’t–as a major financial mechanism of terrorism, or a smart way to perform money laundering–let’s take a look at one of the paths it does take. The charitable donation, for example. The charity industry has had their own public relations issues over the last several years for many fly-by-night organizations turning out to be full-on scams, like some alleged “Bitcoin exchanges” of days gone by. Bitcoin’s digital currency and its blockchain public ledger are seen as a way to improve not just the efficiency of corporate banking interests, but also smaller operations like charities.\n\nCharities can grow quite large, too. Two of the largest, the United Way and Greenpeace, have been accepting Bitcoin for some time now. The attraction to Bitcoin by more and more charity organizations becomes clear when you consider the inherent advantages of Bitcoin over legacy economic models like debit cards. Transparency is one that is readily apparent.\n\n“Charities always face issues in terms of managing the trust,” said Rhodri Davies, head of the Giving Thought policy program at CAF. “With blockchain, you will be able to see where the money goes and track your donation as it goes through the charity.”\n\nIdentity theft is virtually eliminated, maintaining a level of trust in the charity. For those who don’t want to reveal their donations publicly, personally-identifiable information is not tied to these transactions, directly. Also, there is no limit on the amount of the transaction, often brought on by a merchant processor. You could deliver $0.50 USD or $1 Million USD with the same amount of ease. If you want to donate $1 million USD via traditional channels, however, it immediately becomes both public, time-consuming, and subject to potential theft through a potential attack of the intermediaries that hold these transactions.\n\n“‘Nano-donations’—much smaller amounts of money—could become the way in which people donate in the future,” said Peter Smith, chief executive of Blockchain, told the Financial Times.\n\n“At the moment, you can’t really donate tiny amounts of money—and can’t send small amounts of money, as well. With Bitcoin and blockchain, you could now [donate money to] pay schoolchildren a dollar for every assignment that they complete or a cent for every page they read in a book: you can incentivize reading. There are lots of really cool models.”\n\nOn top of that, for those companies that hold a portion of these donations for any length of time, they can also see a nice appreciation that can increase the value of their funds.\n\nThe value of using Bitcoin as a method of payment is very clear, for those who care to investigate what it has to offer, like the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. They have recently raised over 2,500 British pounds, or almost $4,000 USD, on 600 Bitcoin donations. Such small donations would be gobbled up by processing fees using a traditional debit or credit card, but Bitcoin users are spared these unnecessary third-party expenses.\n\n“We look at bitcoin as an online cash box,” said Luke Williams, project leader for bitcoin at the RNLI.', 'Cloud mining provider, Genesis Mining, is expanding its mining operations with the launch of Ether Cloud Mining contracts. For the first time, customers of Genesis Mining will be able to mine for Ether, the fuel that powers the Ethereum network.\n\n“Our customers asked and we listened. Due to our large-scale GPU mining activities we are glad to offer significant parts of our farms for Ether mining in the cloud. Users can therefore benefit from our economy of scale and our geothermal-powered and optimized GPU mining rigs in Iceland. We are bullish on Ethereum and look forward to giving our customers the chance to profit from this exciting innovation and also support the network,” Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, said in a statement.\n\nTo some, Ethereum is considered Bitcoin v2.0. It was developed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and has since gone on to raise more than $15 million to allow participants to create and execute smart contracts. A smart contract is a protocol that can execute the rules found in a contract without the need for human intervention.\n\n“Our GPU mining farms are mining X11 and Ethereum. We are expanding them continuously, and since we are selling Ethereum in the cloud now, we are ramping up more Ethereum mining capacity,” Streng said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nGenesis Mining already had a farm of GPU miners — which are inefficient at mining bitcoin — because it offers X11 mining. Since so many users were interested in Ethereum, the company chose to divert resources to the task of mining Ether. This move has no impact on its bitcoin mining farm.\n\n""More miners on the network definitely helps increase the network security. It’s great to see operations organizations such as Genesis take an interest in supporting Ethereum,” said Vitalik Burterin in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nContracts are for One Year\n\nThere is currently an effort underway at Ethereum to transition from proof of work to proof of stake, which grants power to those who hold coins. The more of a coin that someone holds, the more they are able to mine. Because of this, Genesis Mining will be offering only short-term contracts.\n\n“It is a one-year mining plan which focuses on Ethereum and switches to X11 after Ethereum switches from PoW to PoS until the year [2016] is over,” Streng said. “It is an accelerated ROI [return on investment] compared to our lifetime contracts because of the low prices, zero fees (all contained upfront) and shorter timeframe.”\n\nGenesis Mining will be offering three plans. Small-scale mining is 3MHs for $53.97, medium-scale mining is 50MHs for $899.50 and large-scale mining is 100MHs for $1,799.\n\nJacob Cohen Donnelly is a consultant and journalist in the bitcoin space.

The Fold app also allows users to receive discounts at Target and Whole Foods Market.\n\nMany bitcoin users already take advantage of the discounts Fold provides for Starbucks gift cards; users get a 20% discount paying with bitcoin.\n\nAirbitz Streamlines The Fold Process\n\nAirbitz has further streamlined the process for using Fold, even though the process is fairly simple to begin with, Airbitz noted in a blog post. By using Airbitz’s buy-and-sell feature, users can link the service to their bank account and buy gift cards directly.\n\nIn addition to these discounts, the Airbitz app also allows customers to buy and sell bitcoin through Glidera, another bitcoin wallet.\n\nTo launch the Fold integration, Airbitz has developed Starbucks-inspired aprons, according to International Business Times. In addition, more than 100,000 flyers will be distributed outside coffee shops in the next few weeks.\n\nHow It Works\n\nUnder “settings” in the Airbitz app is an option to select “buy/sell/spend.” The settings are on the left side for Android devices and on the right side for iOs. Users can then select either up to 20% off on Starbucks or 20% off on Target. Funds can be added by selecting the desired amount for a gift card. Leftover funds can be credited back to the Airbitz app.\n\nStarbucks customers can load bitcoin onto the Fold app, which then transfers the purchase amount from the customer’s bitcoin wallet to a virtual Starbucks gift card. The customer then takes their smartphone to Starbucks and has the barcode scanned by a barista.

12/17/2015,"[""What factors make Texas an ideal state for Bitcoin mining and Blockchain marketing, despite the reluctant attitude among governments and central banks around the globe towards the Cryptocurrency phenomenon? How ideal is the Bitcoin environment for the residents of the state? Are there any new frontiers for the oil and gas industry that are being created by Bitcoin in Texas?\n\nCoinTelegraph decided to ask Robert Gonzalez about the problems of Bitcoin and the Blockchain in Texas. Mr. Gonzalez, the founder of UTXO, a Bitcoin mining company based in Houston Texas, says the goal of his company is in creating a way to provide clean bitcoins frictionlessly to people by linking miners to traders.\n\nCointelegraph: How would you rate the development of the Bitcoin and Blockchain market in Texas?\n\nRobert Gonzalez: Texas is still in a prosperous growth with Bitcoin, and an ideal state in which to work with Bitcoin. The regulations for Bitcoin in Texas make it great for any future and existing Bitcoin enterprise in which to work. The blockchain market with the help of Bitcoin is creating a new frontier for different industries (oil and gas), that will provide significant avenues of financial ease in those industries’ business operations.\n\nCT: Are there any peculiar problems encountered by Bitcoiners in Texas, and what could these problems be?\n\nRG: As of now I have not encountered any hardships with businesses exploring Bitcoin business in Texas. Like I mentioned before, Texas is a prime state to work with in the Bitcoin/blockchain technology .\n\nCT: Do you have any laws or license requirements in the state for Bitcoin and Blockchain?\n\nRG: Yes, since we mine the bitcoins with our mining partners that help us, it requires a certain license to do so. As long as you mine Bitcoin you can sell Bitcoin without the option of requiring a money transmitter license, but only if you sell to Texas residents. That is where our company UTXO comes into place. Individuals and business can purchase coins in less than an hour that are brand new coins.\n\nCT: How is the relationship between the banks and Bitcoin/Blockchain companies in Texas?\n\nRG: Since banks work with federal guidelines and regulations, we tend to tell our regional banks exactly what we do, and they understand it and for now we are okay on those sides. Most of our business is cash, either meeting with our agents or depositing into our bank account.\n\nCT: How many BTMs are there in Texas?\n\nRG: The amount of Bitcoin atms in Texas is about less than 10 in total. The problem with using machines is maintaince, and that is something our company has solved by having agents or representatives in major cities willing to meet with customers to assist them. We put a face on our company. Bitcoin was built for the people and we like to keep it that way, face to face transactions are what is keeping our traction up.\n\nCT: How many outfits accept bitcoin in Texas that you know of?\n\nRG: That's a good question, in Houston I know of a hand full of cafes that accept Bitcoin. Most of our customers seem to purchase Bitcoin to hold as an investment, others purchase things online like on Overstock etc. the others resell our coin which we don't mind. Our terms of service specifically require intensive checks on our customers to make sure they are who they say they are, and to make sure they aren't using anything for illegal or illicit activities.\n\nCT: How easy is it to exchange Bitcoin with fiat currencies in Texas?\n\nRG: I would say it is pretty easy, almost as easy as purchasing coins through us. Typically when someone purchases coins through us, they don't ask “Where can I cash out?”. If so I would suggest one of my friends, Sheldon Weisfeld’s Bitcoin ATMs, called CoinVault ATM which he has in the Houston George R Brown Convention Center and other places around Texas.\n\nAre you interested in the theme of this article? Look at our ratings of blockchain companies/cryptocurrencies in top of Bitcoin Cloud Mining."", 'Bitcoins are a class of investment widely known yet rarely fully understood. Accordingly, if you are willing to pursue a deliberate and dedicated approach to wealth creation within this sphere, you’ll so be equipped to at once benefit where others do not; and stand to grow your skills at delivering rapid returns in the market.\n\nIf possession is nine-tenths of the law, knowing what to do when it comes to trading bitcoins is an absolute necessity. This is because bitcoins – like forex, binary options, futures and any other investments – are highly rewarding to those who know how to wield them; and can be punishing on those who do use them carelessly. Just like flying in an airplane, when a clear direction is aimed for – and suitable preparation is done beforehand – such a journey can be done with a sufficiently manageable amount of risk. This is the core lesson of trading bitcoin with binary options. Beyond this, a broader lesson of Bitcoin is taken from the adage ‘be weary what you read in the newspapers’.\n\nWhile this is not exclusive to Bitcoin, it is true as a new form of investment – and a global and solely cloud-based one at that – the capacity for misrepresentation among commentators can be high. A prime example of this came with news in early December of the apparent arrest of Bitcoin founder Craig Steven Wright – more widely known by his alleged alias Satoshi Nakamoto – with chief reasons for the arrest yet to come to light at the time of writing. Yet, regardless of this event, Bitcoin’s future is separate, distinct and independent from Mr Wright’s affairs. In turn, it is a bright future – for notwithstanding speculative reports in some circles – often overlooked is how bullish others are on Bitcoin, with recent weeks finding the Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Long praising the currency as a sign of the future.\n\nAccordingly, though further reading and research on your own are prudent, the following foundational elements of bitcoin offer an excellent platform on which to begin your reading.\n\nBitcoin as a virtual currency is increasingly being used in e-commerce and the ‘online economy’ given its freedom from bank fees, charges and ‘red tape’ regulations. Not just online but beyond bitcoin increasingly is viewed as an attractive prospect given the tremulous nature of the share market, property and regular currency in USD, and, of course, the Euro.\n\nFurther, you can trade bitcoin with binary options for quick profits, as the advantage of Bitcoin is though other currencies may be prone to long term valuations and devaluations respectively, Bitcoin is more likely to experience rapid upticks and downturns. This may appear daunting at first, but anyone who has dealt in forex or binary options will find this familiar, and recognise bitcoin is an excellent avenue within the currency market.\n\nWhat’s more, when combined with a binary options platform, Bitcoin looms as a more attractive option still. With a number of new platforms now accepting or preparing to provide traders the chance to use the Bitcoin currency, you’ve positive proof the old way of trading and wealth generation is set to undergo a considerable change. In turn, there is now a chance to quickly make liquid your existing assets in pursuit of a new investment. And, should you wish to exchange your Bitcoin currency to take advantage of an uptick in evaluation of the USD or EUR? Then that is easy to do too!\n\nFlexibility and diversity. This is what trading Bitcoin on a binary options platform offers you. For those who find themselves intent on a more proactive pursuit of a market, these two assets serve as an ideal avenue for entry into the market economy of the online age.\n\nArticle by Any Option.

The elimination of banks and other financial institutions as middlemen is a major selling point to users, as it has the potential to sharply reduce transaction costs while allowing virtually instantaneous payments. Objections from countries that do not allow bitcoin, or that sharply restrict its use, focus on the anonymity of transactions. The fact that bitcoin has been linked to both drug trafficking and the financing of terrorism is causing many countries, and especially the European Union, to consider sharply tightening regulations.\n\nBitcoin, like other so-called crypto-currencies, functions outside the purview of central banks, which seek to direct economies by increasing or decreasing the amount of currency in circulation and by raising or lowering interest rates. It will be interesting to see what impact, if any, bitcoin has on the reactions of central banks when the next financial crisis hits.\n\nThe US\n\nThe United States is arguably the most bitcoin-friendly country in the world, with the currency accepted by both major companies such as Dish Network and an increasing number of small businesses. The first regulations were issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) in March 2013, putting digital currency exchangers and processors under the Banking Secrecy Act by defining them as money service businesses. This means the companies must comply with a range of registration and record-keeping requirements consistent with other financial institutions.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued investment advisories that warn of the risky nature of investing in bitcoin. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats it as property rather than as currency for tax purposes.\n\nCanada\n\nBitcoin is lightly regulated in Canada, and the Canadian Senate recommended it remain that way. With a new Liberal government having taken office in November 2015, however, it remains to be seen if that may change. The currency's popularity in the country has been uneven. The first bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver in October 2013, allowing people to trade between Canadian dollars and bitcoin. But in 2015, two major exchanges went out of business. This was followed by the announcement that one of the country's largest pension funds, the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, was considering making investments in bitcoin and related startup businesses.\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralia has been very friendly toward bitcoin and does not have any significant restrictions on its use. But in September 2015, local banks closed the accounts of 13 of the 17 exchanges operating in the country due to concerns regarding links to illegal activities; this move was not required by the Australian anti-money laundering agency but was initiated by the banks themselves. The closures make it much harder to move money between the Australian dollar and bitcoin. This has caused its popularity among mainstream businesses, especially retailers, to decline sharply.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nBitcoin has been relatively free of regulation in the European Union and received a major boost from an October 2015 court decision that exempts transactions with the digital currency from value-added tax (VAT). This puts Bitcoin in line with transactions in other currencies. However, in the aftermath of the Nov. 13, 2015, terror attacks in Paris, there have been widespread calls for a crackdown on anonymous forms of payment. This includes Bitcoin, other digital currencies and prepaid debit cards. Legislation regarding this is expected to be introduced in the European Parliament early in 2016.\n\nJapan\n\nJapan has been very hospitable to bitcoin and has been subject to minimal regulation. However, the Mt. Gox scam and bankruptcy that erupted in February 2014 has led to calls for the introduction of a regulatory structure. This is likely to include a sharp reduction in the anonymity of transactions and rules to prevent money laundering. Regulations are expected to be introduced early in 2016."", 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'JPMorgan is ""aggressively"" investing in the next generation of technology like blockchain and robotics and its investment drive in these areas is part of its ""major priorities"" in 2016, according to an internal memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nA note sent to employees by Daniel Pinto, head of JPMorgan\'s Corporate and Investment Bank, shows that the lender wants to ensure its $9 billion (£6 billion) investment in technology continues in 2016.\n\nBlockchain, big data, and robotics are the focus for JPM. Working groups are also being pushed to develop ""market-leading platforms,"" with no detail on what they might be.\n\nHere\'s an excerpt from the memo (emphasis ours):\n\nAs we look ahead to 2016, one of our major priorities will be to aggressively pursue the innovative technologies that we have been making investments in. Internal working groups have made significant advances this year and will be provided even more freedom to develop market-leading platforms in 2016.\n\nWe have also established teams dedicated to areas such as blockchain technology, big data applications and robotics.\n\nBlockchain is a name for the software underpinning bitcoin that uses complex cryptography and distributed ledgers — copies of records in multiple places — to regulate, record, and enable transactions using bitcoin.\n\nRight now, if you pay someone in pounds, one bank will have to get in touch with the other and tell them to update the balance. Then at the end of the day, bulk transactions are moved between banks, via an intermediary, to make sure everyone has the right amount of cash.\n\nWith the blockchain, all that hassle is wiped out — you just pay another person directly into a digital wallet.\n\nBanks are excited about the possibility of adapting this technology for use in traditional financial services, using bitcoin\'s blockchain or, more likely, a replica system — a private blockchain. This would allow banks to enjoy the benefits of the blockchain when dealing with each other.\n\nJPMorgan has been instrumental in trying to bring blockchain to the mainstream, becoming one of the first banks to sign up to the R3 partnership. R3 is a startup convening the banking industry to develop sector-wide standards and use cases for the blockchain.\n\nOn Thursday, software nonprofit The Linux Foundation also ""announced a new collaborative effort to advance the popular blockchain technology,"" involving JPM.\n\nIn his note to employees, Pinto expresses his ""thanks and appreciation to all of you for the outstanding work,"" and says 2015 saw JPM evolve alongside the ""momentous transformation"" of the banking industry. This was done by radically growing investment in, and focus on, technology.\n\nHe goes on:\n\nBeing the industry leader means driving change, not following it, which is why we have also been working and investing alongside established technology companies, as well as ambitious, young start-ups that are looking at a wide range of technological advancements.\n\nJPM has invested in peer-to-peer lender Prosper and payments startup Square, among others.\n\n\'The momentous transformation\' of the banking industry\n\nPinto\'s memo fits with the warning from JPM\'s CEO Jamie Dimon in his annual letter to shareholders in April.\n\nDimon said that ""Silicon Valley is coming"" and if banks don\'t up their game, then tech companies will take over the industry\'s business.\n\n""There are hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking,"" Dimon wrote.\n\n""The ones you read about most are in the lending business, whereby the firms can lend to individuals and small businesses very quickly and — these entities believe — effectively by using Big Data to enhance credit underwriting.\n\n""They are very good at reducing the \'pain points\' in that they can make loans in minutes, which might take banks weeks,"" Dimon continued. ""We are going to work hard to make our services as seamless and competitive as theirs. And we also are completely comfortable with partnering where it makes sense.""\n\n""Rest assured, we analyze all of our competitors in excruciating detail — so we can learn what they are doing and develop our own strategies accordingly,"" Dimon wrote.\n\nDimon\'s warning and JPM\'s push into blockchain, open data, and robotics come at a time where banks are starting to feel the pressure from the tech industry.\n\nEx-Barclays CEO Anthony Jenkins warned earlier this year that banks are facing an ""Uber moment"" that could reduce headcount by up to 50%. There are sign this could already be happening — 11 big banks have cut a combined 10% of their staff this year.\n\nAnalysis by The Financial Times showed that almost 100,000 banking jobs were cut this year, equivalent to 10% of the combined staff of the 11 big European and US banks that announced cuts. But much of this was due to a decline in client activity and cost-cutting in the face of stricter regulation.', ""Bitcoin ATMs are a necessary part of the cryptocurrency infrastructure. Until there will be a robust Bitcoin economy without the need of frequent exchanges to fiat money, their existence could hardly be in doubt. CoinTelegraph spoke to two BTM operators in Slovakia: Marián Jan?uška, CEO of IT company 0011 and operator of the first European BTM, and Peter Bešina, CEO of Cryptodiggers.eu. Topics include the patterns of people using BTMs, technical reliability of the machines, their future, new projects, and what is the atmosphere like in the Bitcoin community.\n\nCoinTelegraph: What was the demand like during two years of BTM operation, were there any remarkable changes?\n\nMarián Jan?uška: I have noticed some correlations to Bitcoin price. Usually, demand decreases after a steep rise in price, when people expect a return to a stable price or a correction. In other cases, a rise in price can spark panic buying as noticed at the end of 2013. On the other hand, people don’t seem to take advantage of falling prices when the demand is low. I must also note that there are customers who buy Bitcoins regardless of the price. These customers most likely use Bitcoins as a means to doing business, not as a store of value.\n\nCT: How do you see those two types of BTMs as regards their reliability and technical problems?\n\nMJ: The Lamassu machine had some issues during the first year of its operation, but the Lamassu team was not only responsive in resolving these issues, but was also able to deliver software upgrades which made the operation much more stable and reliable. I highly appreciate the full control the operator of a Lamassu machine has, including a possibility to run one’s own server and integrate with the machine’s software.\n\nBitXatm’s Sumo Pro may be more suitable for the operator who prefers not to deal with the technical part of the operation, as this is covered solely by the BitXatm team. The BitXatm software is not open-source, which can make its development costly and lengthy. The BitXatm team is responsive to issues, though the machine’s reliability level seems to be a bit below the one offered by Lamassu.\n\nCT: Do BTMs have a bright future? Is it a good business venture?\n\nMJ: BTMs have as bright future as Bitcoin itself. If you’re considering operating a BTM, you need to assess potential demand in your area. If you want to help start a Bitcoin economy, you should make sure you can operate the BTM without profit for an extended period of time, i.e. minimize your fixed costs. As of now, I don’t have any plans to expand to other cities in Slovakia, but will gladly support any initiative like that.\n\nPeter Bešina: You never know if you don’t try. We believe in the blockchain technology regardless if we succeed or not, otherwise we wouldn’t do it. However there are many conditions that impact the profitability of a single BTM. Rent costs, fees, the price of the BTM; as in any other business, you have to evaluate the business case on it’s merits.\n\nCT: Any new bitcoin projects in the plan?\n\nMJ: A few ideas, but also many other activities and priorities. I definitely don’t want the Bitcoin ATM to be my only contribution to our bright future…\n\nPB: CryptoDiggers has a multi-currency payment gateway ready for use since last year. There is an API for public use. Also the GUI backend allowing users to setup a master account for their eshop business using our eshop payment plugins for the well-known e-shops like OpenCart, Magento, and Woocommerce. Of course our Android PoS terminal Application,which allows larger merchants to accept any of CryptoDiggers supported coins (BTC, LTC, WDC), without special privileges for casher. We are supporting EUR, USD, GBP, CAD, AUD, JPY and CNY based eshops to get the correct exchange rate and QR code in the checkout process.\n\nIn a month we will release a new merchants component, offering real value by providing one master account for all related businesses. It will store details for as many eshops as the master account will need, and details about the company (including banking information) in the case that the merchant needs to exchange coins for fiat currency. As we are also a partner for our customers as exchange mediator for EUR, having TIER3 on Kraken we are preparing this feature especially for EU based customers using SEPA transfers.\n\nCT: How do you perceive the Bitcoin atmosphere over the last two years? Is there any stable progress or no? Do people who have heard of BTC still perceive it as some ponzi or get rich quick scheme?\n\nMJ: People who know Bitcoin only from the mainstream media can only repeat what is published in the media. Although the topics are slowly shifting from ‘ponzi-scheme’ to ‘blockchain innovation’, The mainstream media never misses a chance for a sensational (e.g. ‘terrorist funding’) headline. Fortunately, there are people who are curious and brave enough to take the first step and try this still very new thing for themselves, learn, explore... Not many, but numbers are growing.\n\nI think people in Slovakia are quite conservative and careful when it comes to their money. However they rarely understand the big picture, long-term risks and consequences of their investment decisions or central bank policies. One way to open people to Bitcoin is an education towards financial literacy. However, this is not the path masses will take. The Bitcoin industry needs to come up with solutions which are easy to grasp and provide immediate tangible benefits in comparison to non-blockchain alternatives. There are also many opportunities in private as well as public sector companies and organizations, but similarly as with people, it takes a bit of courage, commitment and will to take your fate into your own hands.\n\nPB: I think many people left the community because of many affairs like MtGox and the price decline. You have to understand that the greediness of the people was a big driver and motivator at the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014. But the community in the last few months is again rising from the ashes like the phoenix, and I hope the driver won’t be just profit, but the faith in crypto economy based on decentralized blockchain technologies.\n\nI really don’t know whether people are talking about Bitcoin as a ponzi scheme, except for some desperate articles in the IT websites. However, as with any kind of investment or money operations, you have to check where you put the investments.\n\nI've heard some opinions or reactions that it is a technology for terrorists. This topic was hot recently in the EU parliament, so we will wait for the official results despite e.g. the UK government’s consideration that digital currencies don’t represent any risk with such volume. I think they know what they are talking about. The reasons and sources for terrorism lie elsewhere.\n\nAre you interested in the theme of this article?

Cook worked as COO before he took over as CEO in 2011.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal spoke with an anonymous senior executive at Apple who said Williams' promotion wasn't a sign that he was in line to be the next CEO. Instead, the person said it formalised the role Williams had been carrying out for years.\n\nHere's how Bloomberg described Williams in its profile of Cook from 2014:\n\nWilliams is Cook's go-to guy — he vets possible acquisitions, coordinates with Foxconn Technology and other manufacturers, and oversees the logistics needed to get millions of devices from Asian factories to stores around the world. He's an uncanny Cook clone: tall, soft-spoken, and an avid fitness buff with an inexhaustible memory for operational details. Both men have MBAs from Duke University and spent early parts of their careers at IBM. In the new Apple, he's Tim Cook's Tim Cook.\n\nThat's not the only change that Apple announced Thursday. It also put veteran exec Phil Schiller in charge of the App Store.\n\nThe press release also says Apple promoted Johny Srouji to the position of senior vice president for hardware technologies. The former IBM executive has worked at Apple since 2008.\n\nAdvertising exec Tor Myhren will also join the company as vice president of marketing communications early in 2016.\n\nHere's the full press release from Apple:\n\nApple Names Jeff Williams Chief Operating Officer\n\nJohny Srouji Named to Executive Team; Phil Schiller Adds Ecosystem Responsibilities\n\nTor Myhren Joins Apple\n\nCUPERTINO, California — December 17, 2015 — Apple® today announced that Jeff Williams has been named chief operating officer and Johny Srouji is joining Apple’s executive team as senior vice president for Hardware Technologies. Phil Schiller, senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, will expand his role to include leadership of the revolutionary App Store® across all Apple platforms. Apple also announced that Tor Myhren will join Apple in the first calendar quarter of 2016 as vice president of Marketing Communications, reporting to CEO Tim Cook.\n\n“We are fortunate to have incredible depth and breadth of talent across Apple’s executive team. As we come to the end of the year, we’re recognizing the contributions already being made by two key executives,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Jeff is hands-down the best operations executive I’ve ever worked with, and Johny’s team delivers world-class silicon designs which enable new innovations in our products year after year.”\n\nCook continued, “In addition, Phil is taking on new responsibilities for advancing our ecosystem, led by the App Store, which has grown from a single, groundbreaking iOS store into four powerful platforms and an increasingly important part of our business. And I’m incredibly happy to welcome Tor Myhren, who will bring his creative talents to our advertising and marcom functions.”\n\nJeff joined Apple in 1998 as head of worldwide procurement and in 2004 he was named vice president of Operations. Since 2010 he has overseen Apple’s entire supply chain, service and support, and the social responsibility initiatives which protect more than one million workers worldwide. Jeff played a key role in Apple’s entry into the mobile phone market with the launch of iPhone®, and he continues to supervise development of Apple’s first wearable product, Apple Watch®.\n\nIn nearly eight years at Apple as vice president of Hardware Technologies, Johny Srouji has built one of the world’s strongest and most innovative teams of silicon and technology engineers, overseeing breakthrough custom silicon and hardware technologies including batteries, application processors, storage controllers, sensors silicon, display silicon and other chipsets across Apple’s entire product line. Educated at Technion, Israel’s Institute of Technology, Johny joined Apple in 2008 to lead development of the A4, the first Apple-designed system on a chip.\n\nWith added responsibility for the App Store, Phil Schiller will focus on strategies to extend the ecosystem Apple customers have come to love when using their iPhone, iPad®, Mac®, Apple Watch and Apple TV®. Phil now leads nearly all developer-related functions at Apple, in addition to his other marketing responsibilities including Worldwide Product Marketing, international marketing, education and business marketing. More than 11 million developers around the world create apps for Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, OS X®, watchOS™ and tvOS™ — as well as compatible hardware and other accessories, and customers have downloaded more than 100 billion apps across those platforms.\n\nTor Myhren joins Apple from Grey Group, where he has served as chief creative officer and president of Grey New York. Under his leadership, Grey was named Adweek’s Global Agency of the Year for both 2013 and 2015. As vice president of Marketing Communications at Apple, Tor will be responsible for Apple’s advertising efforts and will lead an award-winning team that spans a broad range of creative disciplines from video, motion graphics and interactive web design to packaging and retail store displays.\n\nTor will succeed Hiroki Asai, who earlier announced plans to retire after 18 years in graphic design and marketing communications roles at Apple.\n\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV.

Critical infrastructure includes nuclear power stations, the electricity grid and flood defense systems.\n\nAt the very onset of the partnership, there will be prototypes built to “enhance resiliency, security and reliability of critical infrastructure,” a press release reveals.\n\nBlockchain Security\n\nThe release also points to Guardtime as the “first and only platform for ensuring the integrity of data and systems at an industrial scale.”\n\nThe working group developed a blockchain security technology called Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI), a system that predates the most well-known and used blockchain of them all, Bitcoin’s blockchain. The cryptocurrency, bitcoin, uses the blockchain as a public ledger for transactions and KSI uses a public ledger in a similar vein for data transactions, negating the need for trusted insiders for verification or authentication. ‘Keyless,’ simply put, with transparency and accountability.\n\nIt is this KSI system that does the job of protecting vital systems beyond the solutions offered by physical perimeter security. The same KSI system that will presumably be used by Guardtime for protecting vital infrastructure, although this hasn’t been explicitly confirmed.\n\nFundamentally, the means to continuously verify the system, processes and data integrity would scale up security measures in such a way that even the slightest change in a reading would trigger suspicion for malicious activity, thereby quickly granting the administrator the means to mitigate such attacks in real time. It’s entirely plausible that the entire process is automated, with instant detection and mitigation capabilities by the system itself, without the need for human input.\n\nIn a statement, Dr. Catherine Mulligan, head of digital strategy and economics at Future Cities Catapult said:\n\nGuardtime’s unique permissioned blockchain approach to large scale system integrity has tremendous potential to enhance the security of UK critical infrastructure and we are excited to work with the Guardtime team to build solutions that will play a key part in the government’s industrial strategy and showcase to the world how cities can be smarter in the future.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'MBA students from some of the world’s top business schools are pioneering the cryptocurrency bitcoin in disruptive start-ups hoping to rival big banks. MBAs are tapping into new technology underpinning bitcoin in ventures taking on areas such as payments, lending, and international transfers.\n\n“The underlying blockchain technology has the potential to impact the global economy on the scale of the internet,” said Dan Elitzer, an MBA student at MIT Sloan School who worked at Circle, a leading bitcoin start-up in the US.\n\nThey follow the stream of high-profile Wall Street leaders ditching the likes of JPMorgan, Visa, and Citi in favour of bitcoin start-ups that are raising increasing amounts of venture capital. VC-backed bitcoin ventures have raised $4.8 billion, according to CB Insights.\n\nThe swelling interest in bitcoin among MBAs also comes as elite US business schools begin to broach the subject in formal courses on the digital currency.\n\nBoth NYU Stern and Duke Fuqua business schools have brought bitcoin programs to their MBA students.\n\nProfessor Campbell Harvey at Fuqua said the bitcoin blockchain has the potential to “disrupt the way we transact, verify ownership, and construct contracts”.\n\nNot only are nimble start-ups pushing into the bitcoin area, but large lenders too: Goldman Sachs made waves this month when it made a patent application for a new virtual currency called “SETLcoin”. Others including HSBC and UBS recently joined an initiative to develop the blockchain, R3.\n\n“Many of the major banks may use blockchain technology to create internal systems for transferring money across borders or between banks,” said David Yermack, professor of finance at NYU Stern.\n\nSquaring The Cryptocurrency Circle\n\nLast year, Harvard MBA Paul Camp was global head of the $3 billion a year transaction services unit at JPMorgan. Now he’s the chief financial officer for Circle, a mobile payments start-up built on the bitcoin network.\n\nCircle launched its first product, an app for storing and transferring bitcoin, last year. The company said it has attracted customers in the “six figures”, in 100 countries.\n\nCircle, which has offices in Boston, San Francisco and Dublin, is backed by $76 million from investors including Goldman, IDG China, Breyer Capital, Accel and General Catalyst.\n\nSince graduating from Harvard, Paul has worked for Bank of America, and in numerous positions across Deutsche Bank, including as managing director of cash management for financial institutions.\n\nPumping Up Fintech\n\nFormer Visa CEO Joe Saunders led the payments company through its IPO on Nasdaq seven years ago. Since retiring in 2012, the University of Denver MBA has made a bold return, pushing into the financial technology sector with the launch of Green Visor Capital, a VC firm focused on fintech start-ups.\n\nKey investments include $8 million in Cloud Lending Solutions, a tech provider to peer-to-peer lenders; $5 million poured into DataFox, a research and analytics platform; and a $1.5 million injection into Kash, a payments venture based in San Francisco which is taking on credit card providers.\n\n“The changes brought about by the adoption of new technologies has been dramatic and will only accelerate in the months ahead,” Joe, a former MasterCard board director, said recently.\n\nCausing Ripples In Global Currencies\n\nStanford MBA Chris Larsen can trace his roots to fintech. The CEO and co-founder of Ripple, an alternative cryptocurrency based on bitcoin, also founded E-LOAN, one of the first online lenders to float, which was acquired in 2005. Chris also launched Prosper, a leading US peer-to-peer lender, and was the company’s CEO until 2012.\n\nRipple is his latest venture. It is trying to solve some of the problems associated with bitcoin, such as the amount of time it takes to verify transactions.\n\n“If you were executing a transaction involving all kinds of hedge funds, a path could be directed that instead of 20 hops would take one instant hop,” he told Business Insider.\n\nGoogle Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley VC firm, have invested in Ripple. It has raised $70 million in total, and is reportedly valued at $100 million.\n\nXapping Bitcoin Into Space\n\nHarvard Business School graduate Wences Casares is the founder and CEO of Xapo, which offers two products: an easy access wallet for bitcoin and a locked-down cloud storage vault. It aims to combine convenience with security.\n\nXapo is working to bolster its security offering by locating elements of its security architecture within a low orbit satellite.\n\n“Bitcoin’s ability to scale hinges on consumer confidence and the development of services that allow people and institutions to easily and securely store and transact in bitcoin,” Wences said in a blog post.\n\nThe Bay Area based company also launched a bitcoin debit card last year. It has raised $40 million in venture capital from the likes of Greylock Partners and Index Ventures.\n\nKraking Bitcoin Exchange\n\nSince leaving San Francisco State University with an MBA, Ayako Miyaguchi has steered the launch of Kraken Bitcoin Exchange in Japan.\n\nKraken is a leading bitcoin exchange in the US, hoping to expand globally. On the Japan launch, Ayako said Kraken’s ability to handle larger volumes will be a lure for potential Japanese users, such as traders who may not have experimented with bitcoin yet.\n\n“That’s what we can do better than the smaller exchanges,” she said at the time. As managing director, she leads projects and business deals, and handles compliance.\n\nThe San Francisco headquartered company has raised $6.5 million in venture capital from 11 investors, among them Blockchain Capital and Hummingbird Ventures.']"
12/18/2015,"['Will the blockchain be what Bitcoin wasn’t. Credit: Sergey Tarasov Shutterstock Digital cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may have failed to unseat their more traditional rivals, but the technology that underpins Bitcoin may yet bring about a revolution in finance and other industries. This technology is called the ""blockhain"".\n\nThe blockchain acts as a public database or ledger, and is the technology that stores the details of every exchange of bitcoins. What makes it particularly clever is that it is designed to stop the same bitcoin being spent twice, without the need for a third party (like a bank).\n\nThe promise of the blockchain\n\nEven from the early days of Bitcoin, it was believed that the blockchain could be used for much more than recording Bitcoin transactions. What the blockchain does is record a set of details that include a time, a cryptographic signature linking back to the sender and some data that can represent almost anything. In the case of Bitcoin, it is the number of bitcoins being sent but it could be a digital cryptographic signature, called a ""hash"", of any electronic document.\n\nOne of the earliest demonstrations of the potential of using the blockchain in this way was ""proof of existence"", a website that allows a user to upload any document and have its signature recorded for ever on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhat this does is prove that the person who uploaded the document had that specific document in their possession at a specific time. It can also be used to prove that the document had not been altered in any way from that time.\n\nThe blockchain realised\n\nProof of existence was intended as a demonstration of the potential of the blockchain technology. Startup Stampery has turned this service into a business that allows other companies to ""digitally stamp"" any of their electronic documents or emails in order to prove ownership and integrity.\n\nThis week the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the use of the blockchain as a share ownership register for online retailer Overstock.com.\n\nOverstock plans to use alternative trading system technology provided by T0.com, to enable people to buy and sell these shares. The attraction of this system is that it provides instant settlement as opposed to the traditional three day settlement for traditional company stock.\n\nT0\'s implementation of its share register uses an extension of the Bitcoin blockchain called ""Colored Coin"" that was originally seen as adding a ""smart contract"" functionality to Bitcoin. One scenario where this could be used would be where someone was sending Bitcoins for the purchase of a house for example, and the currency would only be released if the contracts for the sale went through.\n\nThe risks and challenges of the blockchain\n\nWhilst Overstock\'s SEC filing does highlight the advantages of having a public ledger that is theoretically secure, it also stresses the risks. One of those is the fact that Overstock has chosen to make the information stored on the the blockchain ledger accessible by anyone, so investors may have concerns about the privacy of their holdings.\n\nHowever, the main risk is one that is a general issue with all blockchain applications, including Bitcoin. This is the fact it is still not known exactly how secure the system is and whether it has any flaws that could be exploited by hackers.\n\nOne potential issue around the use of the blockchain is the fact that there are now a large number of different implementations, all based on different technological approaches. IBM, JP Morgan, Intel and a group of other companies have just launced the ""Open Ledger Project"". Open Ledger does not use the Bitcoin blockchain but implements a different scheme that is more suited to companies wanting to restrict access to the blockchain ledger.\n\nThere is no doubt that the ideas behind the blockchain are clever ones and were critical to enabling a digital currency like Bitcoin to operate with many of the same properties as cash does in the physical world. When the technology is used for other applications, though, it is not absolutely clear that it actually does anything that can\'t be achieved with other, more conventional technology.\n\nThe social issues are harder than the technological ones\n\nIt is not the technology that is stopping shares from being settled instantly. It is regulators and the issues they are dealing with in terms of this type of settlement are social and legal ones, not technical.\n\nIn the hype that surrounds companies that are working on blockchain products, the real challenges facing the actual use of these products are often glossed over, with the main objective being to get rid of third parties but without necessarily replacing all of the positive things those third parties may actually have been doing.\n\nIt is inevitable that blockchain technology will become a mainstream technology. The level of interest being shown in this technology demonstrates its potential for enabling the development of applications that will bring new approaches to old business problems. It is the social, legal and financial challenges that these changes will surface that may prove a much harder problem to solve.\n\nExplore further: Goldman Sachs seeks patent on virtual currency', 'The Linux Foundation has united a number of key players in the tech and finance industry to work together on a new open-source blockchain ‘hyperledger’.\n\nAs my colleague Dennis Howlett once said: “It’s not about Bitcoin, it’s the blockchain stupid”. And he’s right. Although the general public and the national press are obsessing over the future of Bitcoin as a new digital currency, trade organisations are getting themselves excited about the prospect of a new ‘hyperledger’ in the form of blockchain.\n\nBlockchain essentially underpins the capabilities of Bitcoin. But whilst Bitcoin needs blockchain to exist, the same isn’t true vice versa. Blockchain has opportunities that extend way beyond digital currencies. Blockchain, as a new protocol, could potentially impact anything that would benefit from a faster, more secure system of trade.\n\nWhich is why a number of technology companies and big players in the financial sector have come together to work on a new open-source project that will separate blockchain from Bitcoin and focus it on their industry needs.\n\nCompanies such as Cisco, IBM, Accenture, ANZ Bank, Fujitsu, London Stock Exchange Group and Wells Fargo have together, with open-source organisation the Linux Foundation, to contribute code and further the use of blockchain.\n\nJim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation, said:\n\nDistributed ledgers are poised to transform a wide range of industries from banking and shipping to the Internet of Things, among others. As with any early-stage, highly-complex technology that demonstrates the ability to change the way we live our lives and conduct business, blockchain demands a cross-industry, open source collaboration to advance the technology for all.\n\nBut what is it?\n\nThe key questions, therefore, are: what the hell is blockchain and why is it so important to all these companies?\n\nNow, I’m not the most technical of people out there, but essentially blockchain is a distributed ledger that allows for the anonymous trading of assets. The protocol is considered significantly more secure than anything else out there at the moment, as a public record of everything that has been traded is automatically created and any change to a record is automatically logged.\n\nDecentralisation is also key to this, as well as the real-time nature of the transactions. But, I found a blog written on Brookings that defines and explains blockchain better than I could. The authors, Mohit Kaushal and Sheel Tyle, write:\n\nThe elegance of the Blockchain is that it obviates the need for a central authority to verify trust and the transfer of value. It transfers power and control from large entities to the many, enabling safe, fast, cheaper transactions despite the fact that we may not know the entities we are dealing with. The mechanics of the Blockchain are novel and highly disruptive. As people transact in a Blockchain ecosystem, a public record of all transactions is automatically created. Computers verify each transaction with sophisticated algorithms to confirm the transfer of value and create a historical ledger of all activity. The computers that form the network that are processing the transactions are located throughout the world and importantly are not owned or controlled by any single entity. The process is real-time, and much more secure than relying on a central authority to verify a transaction.\n\nWith that cleared up, why are the banks so interested in working with the technology industry on this? Well, as the Linux Foundation notes, blockchain, for example, could allow securities to be settled in minutest instead of days, which could allow for huge efficiencies in these organisations.\n\nAs my colleague Dennis wrote in his earlier piece on the subject:\n\nThe potential impact is huge, hence bank interest (sic). Think of it this way. Each day there are trillions of dollars, yen, British pounds, you name it, swilling around the global banking system. Someone’s lending that money and someone’s borrowing it because even if it is not credited as cleared to your account, the holding bank can still make money from it on overnight deposits. In monetary terms and assuming a 0.5% interest rate spread, financial institutions are making $13.7 million PER DAY for every trillion dollars floating around in the system. Readers can work the math on other rates and amounts. If you factor in payment fees running 2-5-3.75% then blockchain operated payment transfer methods that charge a ‘mere’ 1 percent start to look very attractive to small business and the unbanked.\n\nCollaboration\n\nMany of these organisations had already been working on blockchain as a future ledger already. However, bringing everyone together under a new open-source project is likely to rapidly accelerate progress. Equally, although anyone will in theory be able to contribute to the project, it should also allow for the companies involved to focus development on applications that are important to their industry.\n\nIBM has said, for instance, that intends to contribute tens of thousands of lines of its existing codebase and its corresponding intellectual property to this open source community.\n\nHere are some of the canned statements put forward by the companies involved.\n\nDave Ward, SVP and chief architect, Cisco Systems, said:\n\nThe open ledger project is a key turning point in the industry establishing enterprise grade blockchain technology. It’s key for the industry to enable an open developer community around blockchain and it’s great that so many colleagues are joining and supporting the effort to move the entire Internet community forward.\n\nJeffrey Tessler, Member of the Executive Board, Deutsche Börse AG, said:\n\nDeutsche Börse group sees great potential in blockchain technology and is delighted to join this initiative. As a market infrastructure covering the entire value chain, we believe that the true value of the blockchain will only materialise as part of industry initiatives such as Hyperledger project.\n\nArvind Krishna, Senior Vice President and Director, IBM Research, said:\n\nA broad, cross-industry and open source approach is critical to advance the potential for blockchain and make it mainstream. Even beyond building out standards, creating common code will allow organizations to focus on creating industry-specific applications that enhance the value of this technology.\n\nMoiz Kohari, Group Head of Technology Innovation, London Stock Exchange Group said:\n\nLSEG is committed to an open source collaborative approach to the development of the building blocks for blockchain technology. We believe this technology has the potential to drive change across the industry but will need to be developed in partnership with clients and other industry participants under an open source approach. This needs to be done in a considered and rigorous manner to benefit the market as a whole.\n\nMy take\n\nWatch this space. Although it all seems a bit abstract at the moment, blockchain is likely to be critical in the future.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'There is a new way to send money to and from Kenya by way of the virtual currency bitcoin.\n\nWhile the company, Bitpesa, charges fees significantly lower than traditional money transfer services, some worry that the lack of regulation around bitcoins could put transactions at risk and open the way to criminal activity.\n\nThe bitcoin has been around for six years. It is a digital, decentralized currency, meaning it only exists electronically and there is no regulation or oversight by any bank or financial institution.\n\nA Kenyan start-up called Bitpesa now allows people to send money into and out of Kenya through bitcoins. The company said in just two years, the number of registered users has grown to 4,000.\n\nResearch analyst Michael Kimani has been using Bitpesa since 2013. The cheap transfer rates are a plus, he said, but there are limitations like the volatile bitcoin exchange rate.\n\n“The downside is the volatility, like the price usually goes up and down, so a lot of times I have to convert immediately if I really need the cash because I don’t want to hold it and find that the value has gone down in like a week or something. So that’s usually the downside,” Kimani said.\n\nMoney transfers\n\nThe Overseas Development Institute (ODI) said sending $200 to Africa via traditional money transfer services can carry a fee of up to 12 percent. Bitpesa charges a flat rate of 3 percent on all transactions.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya has warned people against using digital currencies, like bitcoin. The Central Bank said these currencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. In the event of losses, the Central Bank said users will have no recourse locally.\n\nElizabeth Rossiello, co-founder of Bitpesa, believes resistance from financial regulators is misplaced. “We sell Bitcoins for Kenyan shillings and we buy it for Kenyan shillings. There’s no law in Kenya, nor anywhere in Africa, that states bitcoin or virtual currencies to be illegal,” she explained. “We are a registered company in Kenya that follows the law. We do not engage in illegal activities.”\n\nRossiello said traditional money transfer services charge high fees because they can. There is not enough competition.\n\nBitcoin has had a reputation as the currency of choice for hackers and criminals though that perception is changing.\n\nSafe and secure\n\nRossiello said Bitpesa is secure and safe to use. “I think there’s been a general misconception about this technology where people believe bitcoin transactions to be untraceable, therefore inherently insecure. In reality, the reverse is true,” she said. “Every bitcoin transaction leaves an indelible record that can be observed and traced by anyone, including authorities.”\n\nBut Aly Satchu Khan, the CEO of the Nairobi financial management company, Get Rich, said Bitpesa is not yet proven to be a “rock solid platform.”\n\n“I think the concern is predominantly around criminals, criminality or even terrorism funding, that essentially given that they are operating out in an environment outside the purview of most governing authorities, monitory authorities in Africa, that therefore there was an opportunity here, a gap, that the terrorists or the criminal could potentially use virtual currency in order to fund their operations or raid cash or anything of that sort,” said Khan.\n\nThe World Bank people pay $110 million in fees every year to send remittances totaling $1.3 billion to Kenya.\n\nOn a continent-wide level, those remittance fees add up to an estimated $1.4 billion annually.', 'Photo: Anthony Kelly/Flickr\n\nA lawyer for the man who was convicted of what is believed to be the first criminal fraud case in the US related to Bitcoin has revealed new details about the case and his client.\n\nIn 2012, an anonymous Bitcoin entrepreneur known by the handle Pirateat40 launched a so-called ""High Yield Investment Program"" called Bitcoin Savings & Trust.\n\nPirateat40 advertised on the Bitcointalk.org forum, where he promised investors a 7 percent weekly return on deposits of more than 25,000 BTC, a sum worth more than $275,000 at the time. He never explained how he generated these fantastic returns. ""If I told you then I couldn\'t do what I do,"" he said at the time (the thread has since been edited; the original is quoted here).\n\nHowever, Pirateat40 shut down the fund in August of 2012, claiming it had gotten too big for him to manage. Then he disappeared. Investors who hadn\'t been paid back panicked.\n\nEleven months later, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Pirateat40, who turned out to be Texas man Trendon T. Shavers, with running an illegal Ponzi scheme worth around $4.5 million at the time. He was ordered to pay more than $40 million in disgorgement, or illegal profits, as well as a $150,000 civil penalty.\n\nThat wasn\'t the end. The following year, Shavers was charged with criminal wire fraud and securities fraud in the Southern District of New York. He agreed to plead guilty to securities fraud on the condition that the wire fraud charge be dropped, and will be sentenced on February 3.\n\nJason Seibert, who defended Shavers for a short time during the SEC civil action, spoke about the case Tuesday at Inside Bitcoins, an industry conference in San Diego.\n\nIn Seibert\'s telling, Shavers was a scapegoat for an agency reeling from its failure to catch the infamous fraudster Bernie Madoff before he ripped off investors to the tune of $20 billion.\n\nThe situation was made worse by investigators and a judge who didn\'t understand how the digital currency Bitcoin works, Seibert said. He claimed his client was legitimately trying to pay back investors, and he simply lost control of the situation.\n\n""The Bitcoin community that he loved abandoned him.""\n\n""He paid as many people back as he could in the most fair way he could do it, but not everyone got paid back,"" Seibert said. ""So people assumed it must be a Ponzi scheme.""\n\nSeibert, who is based in Oregon, knew of Shavers through the Bitcointalk.org forum. He agreed to represent Shavers even though he knew he might not get paid. He did this because ""the future of Bitcoin was too important to let the first case with the SEC be handled alone.""\n\nWhen Bitcoin Savings & Trust started, Shavers had a formula for investing his client\'s bitcoins, Seibert said.\n\nShavers was ""doing an arbitrage, lending money to others, sending it to MtGox, doing whatever he was doing in his \'magic box\' before giving back to his Bitcoin clients,"" the lawyer said.\n\n""He paid 1 percent per day, per use and did that for almost two years and a lot of people made a lot of money,"" Seibert said.\n\nIt\'s still not known exactly what Shavers did, however. ""Even if I [knew], I can\'t tell you because I represented the man,"" Seibert said.\n\nHowever, Shavers did want to pay his investors back, the lawyer said.\n\n""All you have to do is look at the blockchain to see payment after payment going from Shavers out to lenders,"" he said.\n\nUltimately one day, Bitcoin Savings and Trust ceased to work as it had and Shavers lost all the Bitcoin he had accumulated through the scheme, Seibert said. He claimed Shavers finally made a loan that would never be paid back. Pirateat40 was in trouble. Shavers rarely, if ever, knew with whom he was dealing.\n\nWith no money left, Shavers stopped paying investors, Seibert said, and soon, the SEC showed up with a subpoena—and a vengeance that came from its recent failure to suss out Madoff.\n\n""The SEC got railed for missing the Bernie Madoff issue,"" Seibert said. ""Shavers [was] the Bernie Madoff of Bitcoin and the SEC wasn\'t going to get caught napping.""\n\nThe SEC deposed Shavers without an attorney for ""hours and hours and hours,"" Seibert said. ""He didn\'t know what he was answering or why it mattered. The SEC didn\'t tell him that his answers could be used in the parallel criminal investigation.""\n\nThe investigators did not understand Bitcoin or its underlying architecture, the blockchain, Seibert said. Shavers ""adamantly believed that they didn\'t know what was going on, that they didn\'t understand Bitcoin,"" Seibert said.\n\nSeibert believes the agency was overly aggressive with Shavers\'s case.\n\n""Maybe there is somebody in the SEC office that\'s trying to make a name for themselves in crypto-currency agencies,"" he conjectured. ""People want to be known for things, people want to have value in themselves. You get a motivated SEC attorney post-Madoff who has to show results.""\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin was involved made the case look even better for the agency, Seibert said.\n\n""This was also when the Silk Road was going on,"" Seibert said. ""Bitcoin was big news and now they had a potential Ponzi scheme. A million dollar Bitcoin Ponzi scheme is \'legal sexy.\'""\n\nAfter the case became public, Seibert flew to Dallas to meet with Shavers in person in Mckinney, Texas at a Starbucks. The two talked about how the investigation was handled. The SEC had frozen Shavers\'s assets, Seibert said.\n\n""When you try to go against a SEC agency hell-bent on making a name for itself, what chance did Trendon have,"" Seibert said. ""A snow ball\'s chance in hell, maybe. They shut him down, paralyzed him right from the beginning.""\n\nThe agency had collected Shavers\'s bank records, Seibert said, as well as his account history from the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. Then he said the agency demanded Shavers\'s provide a ""verified accounting"" of his assets.\n\n""The community hated Shavers so much that they didn\'t understand [that] even if Shavers did wrong, the SEC was making bad law, expanding the scope of their power.""\n\n\n\n""They [knew] every single dollar that went from his bank to MtGox and back to his bank,"" Seibert said. Plus, the nature of Bitcoin means all historical transactions can be looked up on the blockchain, which is essentially a public ledger. ""What more verified of an accounting do you need than the blockchain?""\n\nA verified accounting obviously costs money and costs assets. Shavers, for that reason, couldn\'t provide a verified accounting, Seibert said.\n\n""Is that fair?"" Seibert asked rhetorically. ""It\'s not fair, probably not.""\n\nShavers came up with most of his own defense, Seibert said. ""There is a definition of money in the US Code of what money is: legal tender issued by US definitions,"" Seibert said. ""The SEC doesn\'t have jurisdiction over this case because Bitcoin isn\'t money, it\'s not use-currency.""\n\nThe agency didn\'t buy it, however. ""Judge Mazzant had no expertise and sought out no special master to the court,"" Seibert said, referring to the fact that judges can seek out experts for topics in cases they don\'t understand. ""He relied on what the SEC wished the definition of money to be."" Thus, the SEC had acted outside the scope of its authority, Seibert said.\n\n""Instead, the SEC ran to the courthouse and said, \'Judge, you can define it as money,\'"" Seibert said.\n\n""The judge relied on a second year law student\'s article from the University of Illinois,"" Seibert said. He filed a motion for reconsideration.\n\nSeibert tried to explain Bitcoin to the judge: ""Bitcoin is a value transfer protocol,"" he said. ""It\'s a ledger of value transfer, a record of a transaction of a transfer.""\n\n""But, can\'t I buy airline tickets with it?"" the judge asked.\n\n""You can also do that with airline reward miles,"" Seibert said. ""Does that mean airline reward miles are money?""\n\nThe judge decided to treat Bitcoin as money anyway, denied the motion to dismiss the case, and ignored Seibert\'s motion to lift the asset freeze, Seibert said.\n\n""At that point Shavers was done—broke, tired, confused, hurt,"" he said. ""The Bitcoin community that he loved abandoned him."" Shavers felt he had to fire Seibert, because he had no money with which to pay.\n\n""I have to fire you,"" Seibert recalled him saying. He then recounted explaining to his Shavers what would happen to him.\n\n""The second I am gone the SEC is going to move for summary judgement. They\'re going to win a $40 million dollar judgement against you. They\'ll put you in handcuffs right away after pressing criminal charges.""\n\n""Yeah, but at least it will be over at some point in time? Right?"" Seibert recalled Shavers asking.\n\n""I don\'t know when it\'s going to be over,"" Seibert recalled saying.\n\nA campaign seeking Bitcoin to fund Shavers\'s defense was started, but it only raised the equivalent of $50. ""The community hated Shavers so much that they didn\'t understand [that] even if Shavers did wrong, the SEC was making bad law, expanding the scope of their power, and without money to fight and appeal, the community may have cut off its nose to spite its own face,"" Seibert said.\n\nDespite the rulings of Judges Mazzant and Rakoff, how Bitcoin is defined remains muddled. If you ask the IRS about Bitcoin, it will say it\'s property, he said, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will say it\'s a commodity and the SEC will consider it money.\n\n""Whatever they have to say in order to make sure they can regulate it,"" Seibert said.\n\nChristopher Flood of the Federal Defenders of New York, who represented Shavers during the criminal case, had no comment for Motherboard. Shavers could not be reached.', ""The US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) published 10 patent applications yesterday that were filed by Bank of America in June of last year.\n\nThe list of proposals includes a “real-time conversion system”, a “cryptocurrency transaction payment system” and a “cryptocurrency suspicious user alert system”. Patent applications for offline storage, “risk detection” and transaction validation were also published, among others.\n\nTo date, Bank of America has submitted 11 patent applications related to cryptocurrencies, suggesting that the firm may be looking to build, or at least conceptualize, a fully realized cryptocurrency network.

What that means in practice is if people want to trade or transact with each other online they can do it directly, rather than go through a middleman like a clearing house.\n\nCutting out the middle man makes things faster and cheaper, so banks are desperate to find a way to adapt the technology to traditional finance. Goldman Sachs says the technology has the potential to change ""well, everything.""\n\n""The market for private blockchain 24 months ago was zero,"" says Jeremy Millar, a partner at boutique technology bank Magister Advisors. ""Now we’re at a stage in the market where it has already gone into specialisation. This is a market that’s poised to scale incredibly rapidly.""\n\nMillar co-authored an extensive report on bitcoin and blockchain technology that came out this week. It\'s arguably the most extensive overview of the ecosystems surrounding the technology out there.\n\nI got on the phone to him this week to hear how he sees the space evolving and one big take away is just how fast the blockchain space is growing.\n\n""This is the fastest growing market that I have seen in enterprise technology since the internet,"" says Millar. ""Adoption of these projects in the banks is going to be much faster than people think.""\n\n\n\nEveryone gets a win. It’s not just the uber-geek that gets the benefit.\n\nMillar\'s report says almost $1 billion (£670 million) has been invested in bitcoin and blockchain-related technology over the past three years. Well-known financial firms like Goldman Sachs, Citi, and Nasdaq are all investing in the technology.\n\nSo why are banks moving so fast on blockchain? A big reason, Millar says, is because the benefits of the technology are so wide ranging.\n\n""Everyone gets a win. It’s not just the uber-geek that gets the benefit. The CIO gets to replace very expensive, outdated mainframe infrastructure with something better.\n\n""The business owner gets to release capital — this is very important. With the new regulations, post-2008 and Basel III, the collateral and capital that’s required against any trade has increased. Reducing settlement windows allows the banks to do more trades or release more capital.""\n\nBanks legally have to put cash aside to cover a trade until it\'s completed. That\'s to guard against the risk of a settlement house — the middle man — rejecting the trade, going bust, or any other potential risk.\n\nBut by cutting out the middle man the blockchain makes the settlement period — the time it takes to complete a trade — much shorter. That means you can get more bang for your buck from the money set aside to cover the trade, as the efficiency gains theoretically mean you can get more trades done in the same time period.\n\nMillar adds: ""The compliance team gets a win too because if everything is cryptographically signed on a blockchain, two things happen. One, you will spot misbehavior in real-time and two, after the fact no one can tamper with the evidence.""\n\nMillar expects the blockchain markets rapid development to continue for the foreseeable future thanks to the sheer level of money being pumped into the sector. He also expects more businesses to evolve around the technology, such as blockchain analytics.\n\n""This is the banks internet moment,"" Millar says. ""This is their moment in the sun. All of a sudden being a CTO (chief technology officer) or director of information at a bank is sexy.""', ""Bitcoin has had a very volatile trading history since it was first created in 2009. The alternative currency has seen a lot of action in its fairly short life. Bitcoins initially traded for next to nothing. The first real price increase occurred in July 2010 when bitcoins went from around $0.0008 to $0.08 for a single coin. The currency has seen some major rallies and crashes since then.\n\nBitcoin Background\n\nBitcoin was invented by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and released as an open-source software in early 2009. The first transaction took place between Nakamoto and an early adopter of bitcoin in January 2009. The first real-world transaction happened in 2010 when a bitcoin miner bought two pizzas from a Papa John's in Florida for 10,000 bitcoins.\n\nThe currency is based upon a blockchain which contains a public ledger of all the transactions in the Bitcoin network. Those participating in the currency can mine for bitcoins using computer power. The currency had a small initial interest among cryptographers and those seeking to engage in transactions that could not be easily traced.\n\nThe currency gained wider exposure, both good and bad. More retailers opened up to using Bitcoin in 2012 and 2013. However, federal authorities shut down the Silk Road website, which used bitcoins for black market transactions, in October 2013.\n\nThe popular Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange also went under in 2014. Originally started as a site for trading game cards, it evolved into a marketplace for bitcoins. As of May 2013, the exchange was trading around 150,000 bitcoins per day. However, accusations of fraud surrounded the exchange when it closed down in 2014. The exchange lost around 850,000 bitcoins, although some of them have since been found.\n\nEarly Bitcoin Trading\n\nBitcoin really started to take off in 2013. The currency began the year trading at around $13.50 per bitcoin. The price rallied in early April 2013 to get to over $220 briefly before dropping back down to around $70 by mid-April. This was the first real rally and associated crash for the currency.\n\nTrading and Volatility Increase\n\nBitcoin really began to rally in October and November of 2013. The currency was trading at around $100 in early October. It reached around $195 by the end of October. In November, the price went from around $200 to over $1,120 by the end of the month. The rally was caused by new bitcoin exchanges and miners in China entering the marketplace. This period was also when the Mt. Gox exchange was operating. Mt. Gox was involved in around 70% of all bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe price began to get very volatile after reaching these highs. Rumors of a lack of security through Mt. Gox, as well as poor management, made the market nervous. People had problems withdrawing their money from the exchange. The price reached a high of $1,230 on Dec. 4, 2013. This fell to around $750 by December 7, a drop of around 39% over a couple of days.\n\nTrading stabilized to some degree to around $920 in January 2014. However, there was another major crash in early February, around the time the Mt. Gox exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan. Bitcoin was trading at around $911 on February 4, but it cratered to $260 by February 16. This is a decline of around 71%. The price did recover somewhat by March 2014, trading at around $620.\n\nThe price then fell into a slower and more gradual decline. The currency was trading at around $600 in the middle of July 2014. It eroded away to around $315 at the beginning of 2015. The price stabilized to some extent during the summer of 2015. However, early November saw another massive spike. The currency went from around $275 on October 23 to a brief close of about $460 on November 4 on certain exchanges. The currency sold off somewhat and traded around $360 at the end of November 2015.\n\nArbitrage Across Exchanges\n\nBitcoin is traded on a number of non-centralized independent exchanges. There may be differences in the prices among the different exchanges. This may lead to arbitrage opportunities across the different exchanges. The lack of a centralized exchange makes it difficult to ensure a uniform price."", 'Image: Adam Guerbuez\n\nLike so many Bitcoin evangelists, Adam Guerbuez says he\'s passionate about shining a light on the good side of the digital currency.

He films the whole thing, and uploads it to YouTube. These videos have each racked up at least a few thousand views, and others—like his videos exposing police misconduct to promote a dash cam distributor—have garnered millions.\n\nThis apparent altruism is in stark contrast to Guerbuez\'s past life as a brazen Facebook scammer; a marketer of videos reportedly depicting the homeless being assaulted to a white power punk soundtrack, which he now claims was a ""hoax""; and a self-admitted member of the neo-Nazi group Heritage Front in the 1990s. Guerbuez denies any current involvement with the white power movement.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Guerbuez was bankrupted by a lawsuit in which Facebook sued him for $873 million—more than CAD $1 billion. Guerbuez and his company, Atlantis Blue Capital, sent promotional spam to more than 4 million Facebook users and accessed people\'s accounts without their consent, among other transgressions.\n\n""I can say, thank you, Facebook, for making such a spectacle out of my case""\n\nNowadays, Guerbuez says he\'s trying to put all that behind him, and has dedicated himself to promoting Bitcoin through acts of goodwill and the marketing referral programs some Bitcoin businesses offer. I first came across Guerbuez in a live streamed Bitcoin trading competition on YouTube, where he financed three other Bitcoin traders to trade coins for profit for eight hours straight. He\'s also run what he claims was a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme of the Bernie Madoff variety live on Periscope, promising people a double return on any Bitcoins they send him.\n\nIt\'s difficult, given his past and present activities, to say for certain whether Guerbuez has turned a new leaf or not.\n\n""All the negative press about Bitcoin presented a challenge for me, because I don\'t believe that Bitcoin is all about evil, or all about drugs, or whatever they\'re saying,"" Guerbuez told me. ""But the media was trying to present Bitcoin as being the tool of evil. But I thought that Bitcoin is so much more than the small percentage of negativity that\'s out there. So I decided to involve myself with Bitcoin, and the good aspects of it.""\n\nA Quebec court filing from 2012, in which the court refused to discharge the bankrupt Guerbuez from paying Facebook due to his uncooperative nature, describes Guerbuez\'s ""unusual"" approach to online marketing as consisting of ""attracting the media\'s attention by \'creating\' an online personality."" Moreover, the filing states, ""he does not hesitate to \'lie\' by claiming to be very wealthy and to live a luxurious lifestyle.""\n\nOn some dating sites, he called himself ""The Boss"" and claimed to make more than a million dollars each year, according to the filing, but his stated annual income was $48,000. He drove luxury cars, which he said he leased, but couldn\'t provide documentation. He took lavish trips during the year of his bankruptcy, apparently paid for by generous friends, but couldn\'t prove any of it.\n\n\n\n""Under the circumstances,"" the 2012 court filing states, ""it is difficult for the Trustee and the Court to distinguish what is real from what is not.""\n\nGuerbuez says this past is all but a quickly fading memory, save for his forearm tattoo proudly displaying the amount of the Facebook judgement in US dollars: $873 million. The amount is emblazoned with a skull. These days, he says he\'s back on his feet and focused on Bitcoin.\n\nImage: Adam Guerbuez\n\nGuerbuez is heavily engaged in the affiliate marketing programs of various Bitcoin companies, including OKCoin and HashFlare, a cloud mining company. He refers people to these platforms and then receives a cut of the service fees they pay, as well as a small bonus for each individual sign-up. Guerbuez wouldn\'t say how much he makes doing this, but he said that a good affiliate marketer can make $200,000 to $300,000 annually.\n\nOKCoin and HashFlare, when contacted by Motherboard, denied having any sort of formal relationship with Guerbuez or even being aware of who he is. Both companies confirmed that their affiliate marketing programs are made available to all of their users.\n\nGuerbuez would not say how large his portfolio is, but to make the amount of money he claims a good affiliate marketer could make, the number of referrals required would likely have to be in the tens of thousands. With a diverse and robust enough portfolio, across multiple services, it\'s certainly possible for Guerbuez to be making as much as he coyly implies. Whether that\'s likely or not, however, is harder to say.\n\nGuerbuez told me he also has more formal marketing contracts with other Bitcoin companies, but can\'t disclose them due to contractual obligations.\n\n""The doors are open wide when I say, here\'s my history""\n\n""After the bankruptcy period was complete, even during the period, I was working with different companies and trying to get a stable base to start again and get things moving—a fresh start,"" Guerbuez said. ""Bitcoin helped me a lot, because I found a way to work in a really fresh scene.""\n\n\n\nBut Guerbuez doesn\'t hide his controversial past when engaging with people in Bitcoin, he said. In fact, he flaunts it, calling himself the ""873 million dollar man"" and positioning himself as a controversial, yet ""genius""—as his site says—online marketer.\n\n""The doors are open wide when I say, here\'s my history: I\'m a controversial internet marketer and I\'ve gotten worldwide coverage, and I have a passion for Bitcoin and money, so let\'s sit down and talk about a deal about how I can promote your product,"" Guerbuez said.\n\n""My face is already known out there, and I get the job done. So I can say thank you, Facebook, for making such a spectacle out of my case.""\n\nIt\'s not clear how much of what Guerbuez tells me is true—as ever, truth and falsehoods are difficult to disentangle. He\'s a marketing ""genius"" with a checkered past, a crypto-saint feeding the homeless, and a brazen ponzi scheme operator, all at once. Whatever his real intentions, he\'s merely looking for what so many others in the world of Bitcoin are too: a chance to start fresh.\n\nUPDATE: This article has been updated with additional details about Guerbuez\'s past activities that were brought to our attention after publication, include Guerbuez\'s past involvement with a neo-Nazi group and his role in marketing videos that reportedly depict the assault of homeless people.', '']"

And that could affect the banks, as well as credit card companies like American Express, MasterCard, and Visa,"" says Ed Yardeni at Yardeni Research.\n\n""Blockchain still needs to show that it can grow to the size of Visa\'s or MasterCard\'s networks.

During the week, positive macroeconomic indicators from the US were announced, including an increasing of the interest rate to 0.50% for the first time since 2006. As a result, the Dollar was significantly strengthened against all currencies. Recent decisions of the ECB and the Fed have also led to increased demand for the Dollar. However, it had almost no effect on the value of Bitcoins. Bitcoin ended the week with a price of about $458. We asked Tomi Hrovatin, developer of HODL Tools for trading from Slovenia, about the expected price of Bitcoins:\n\n""As always there are two outcomes possible.

What does this imply for Bitpesa as a company? How does this affect the Bitcoin environment in the sub-region? Is Bitpesa rattled by this development?\n\nIt has been a series of speculations since the news broke of the joint suit by Lipisha and Bitpesa against Safaricom for the abrupt cut-off from M-Pesa, a platform of Safaricom which served Bitpesa until the 12th of November 2015. The dust seems to be settling even though the dispute is still ongoing. Preliminary judgement has gone in favour of Safaricom and this leaves investors wondering what becomes of the Bitcoin company, Bitpesa.\n\nBitpesa is unmoved\n\nIn her official release after the High Court ruling, Elizabeth Rossiello, the CEO of Bitpesa remains confident that her company has gone beyond the stage where Safaricom’s action will cause any significant harm to the growth of the company.\n\nIn her words, Elizabeth says:\n\n“For a start-up, East Africa is not for the faint of heart; it is for the big of heart. And no one has a bigger heart than Team BitPesa. Investors, partners, and customers recognize the strength of our team’s bonds. We love having built our company from Kenya and are proud to be expanding rapidly across the African continent. We are passionate about our work, our markets, and our customers. This passion has driven us to steadily and continually accomplish our goals; every month, every quarter. We are now live in four countries, across five mobile money networks, with instant access to over sixty banks, all backed by an incredible team of twenty people on three continents.”\n\nElizabeth went on to state that Bitpesa is not in direct competition with Safaricom’s M-Pesa. She emphasized that while M-pesa is a domestic mobile money network, Bitpesa goes beyond the borders of the East African Country by enabling global digital transactions that build bridges between African companies and those around the world.\n\nTalking like they were prepared for the prevailing situation, she said that while Bitpesa’s first integration and corridor did connect the global bitcoin network to M-Pesa, the BitPesa team quickly added payout and collection corridors to and from Kenyan banks, Nigerian banks, and five other mobile money corridors in Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, and even Kenya and that as a company founded in Kenya, Bitpesa built on M-Pesa, but as a pan-African enterprise, it has gone above and beyond M-Pesa.\n\nGoing by Elizabeth’s assertion, it becomes easy to think that Safaricom’s action towards Bitpesa is like fetching a pail of water from the sea and expecting the sea to run dry as a consequence. Even though she does not particularly insist that the issue is totally insignificant, she exudes a high level of confidence that Bitpesa’s structure has gone beyond the stage where this matter will cause any significant harm to the company.\n\n“ As a company founded in Kenya, we built on M-Pesa; as a pan-African enterprise, we have gone above and beyond M-Pesa.” She says.\n\nIt can still be a win-win for everyone\n\nGeorge Basiladze on the other hand retains a less optimistic opinion towards the situation as he described it as an “extremely difficult matter”.\n\nGeorge is the founder of the Bitcoin payment gateway Cryptopay.\n\nWith reference to the fact that the litigation is still an ongoing process, George had a more technical analysis of the situation. He says that despite the preliminary judgement going in favour of Safaricom with the Court ruling that “Safaricom will not be required to grant access to bitcoin startup BitPesa amid an ongoing legal dispute”, Bitpesa still has a chance of winning the case. Meanwhile, he maintains that Safaricom has the right not to provide the services to BitPesa and InterSwitch. “It is the right of any company to choose its clients and Safaricom would not serve Bitpesa.” Says George.\n\nHe continued by saying that an alternative scenario is that Bitpesa could partner with Safaricom directly, either by equity investment or revenue sharing.\n\nOn whether investors will hold back in moving into the African Bitcoin market pending the outcome of the legal process between Bitpesa and Safricom, George says;\n\n“I do not think so, but it would definitely play a big role.”\n\nDo you want to learn more?

He is currently director of engineering at Coinbase.\n\nI first discovered bitcoin in early 2011.\n\nLike many, I thought it was brilliant. Bitcoin transactions were decentralized, secure, fast, cheap and unlimited.\n\nLet's break down what this means:\n\nDecentralized: Thousands of nodes verify and relay all bitcoin transactions.\n\nThousands of nodes verify and relay all bitcoin transactions. Secure: The bitcoin network is secured by millions of dollars of hardware.\n\nThe bitcoin network is secured by millions of dollars of hardware. Fast: Confirmations were fast. Zero confirmation transactions are very safe as double-spend attacks are impractical.\n\nConfirmations were fast. Zero confirmation transactions are very safe as double-spend attacks are impractical. Cheap: You can pay little to no fees. Your transactions will all get mined in the next block.\n\nYou can pay little to no fees. Your transactions will all get mined in the next block. Unlimited: At that time, bitcoin block sizes were tiny compared to the block size limit. Transactions being delayed due to block size constraint was unheard of. So there’s effectively no limit on transaction throughput.\n\nThe reason why this is the case is due to the brilliant design of Satoshi Nakamoto's creation. Bitcoin is bootstrapped like a startup: equity is paid to the employees initially until the company can make enough money to start paying higher salaries and less equity.\n\nIn the case of bitcoin, mining block rewards pay for the cost of the distributed network initially and slowly transition to have users of bitcoin pay for that cost. And like a startup, bitcoin miners are invested in the success of bitcoin. Essentially, early bitcoin users get the cake and eat it too.\n\nUnfortunately, this won’t last.\n\nBy design, the block rewards halves every four years, and it will trend towards zero.\n\nAs that happens, we will have to choose which of these five core bitcoin features (decentralized, secure, fast, cheap and unlimited) we are most willing to sacrifice.\n\nI will use an analogy to paint the picture for why this is the case.\n\nSatoshi Castle\n\nKing Satoshi built a castle for his peasants. He decides to pay 50 gold pieces a day to hire soldiers to protect his castle and the peasants. Since he does not have unlimited wealth, the plan is to cut the subsidy by half every four years.\n\nSo starting year five, he will only pay 25 gold pieces a day.\n\nAfter about 100 years, he will no longer pay any subsidy for the soldiers. The idea is that the peasants will start to appreciate living in this secure castle and that they will be willing to eventually pay for these soldiers.\n\nSatoshi Castle's security is so good that a lot of peasants from other castles have started to move to Satoshi Castle.\n\nKing Satoshi is a very welcoming king and lets everyone in. Everything is well and good until one day the castle started to get crowded and can no longer fit all the peasants that want in.\n\nWhat is King Satoshi to do? He can:\n\nExpand the size of the castle and welcome everyone. Start charging taxes on the peasants to pay for the soldiers. The tax will make it so that poor peasants can’t afford to live in Satoshi Castle.\n\nOf course, none of the peasants want to start paying taxes. They want Satoshi Castle to stay being the utopia that it was. So, the vocal majority is in support of expanding the castle boundaries.\n\nIgnoring his own unease, Satoshi decided to listen to the peasants and to double the size of the castle every two years.\n\nAs time went on, the problem starts to become apparent. As the castle gets larger, more powerful soldiers are needed to protect the castle if they want to maintain the same level of security.\n\nAs King Satoshi's subsidy started to decrease, some level of taxation became inevitable. But the poor peasants can only afford very little, and rich peasants weren't willing to pay more than the poor ones. Not being paid enough, soldiers start to quit.\n\nThis left the castle vulnerable to attacks. One day, soldiers from Yellen Castle came and stormed Satoshi Castle and destroyed it.\n\nAs you can see from this analogy, increasing the block size limit (castle size) instead of increasing taxes (transaction fees) will result in soldiers (miners) quitting and a decrease in security.\n\nBIP 101\n\nEarly Bitcoin users are spoiled.\n\nHaving used a decentralized, secure, fast, cheap and unlimited network for a few years, they are not willing to concede on any of these five features. Most of these early bitcoin users don't understand how and why bitcoin works.\n\nYou cannot have the most secure network being highly decentralized and still get huge transaction throughput, fast transactions and low fees.\n\nSome things have to give.\n\nIn the case of Visa, you are giving up decentralization and low costs, but you get fast, secure and unlimited. That’s not a bad tradeoff, but that's not bitcoin.\n\nRunning a centralized system is much more efficient and cheaper than the total cost of a decentralized system. If bitcoin has 5,000 nodes, the cost of a bitcoin transaction will be something like 5,000 times that of a Visa transaction.\n\nThat’s just the nature of decentralization.\n\nThe cost is multiplied since each node has to do the same work as every other node. Mining block rewards are paying for that cost today. As mining block rewards trend towards zero, transaction fees will need to pay for this cost.\n\nPeople think that a solution like BIP 101 will work, but I think BIP 101 is too dangerous.\n\nAs shown by the castle analogy, BIP 101 is valuing cheap and unlimited over secure and decentralized. (BIP101 has no effect on fast, but as one can see from the replace-by-fee proposals, fast won;t last long).\n\nBIP 101 increases the block size too quickly. This will destroy any chance of a fee pressure due to supply constraint.\n\nTo keep high throughput and low fees, security and decentralization will be destroyed eventually. This would happen because miners will create large blocks that are not economical for the network to bear.\n\nThis forces other miners to leave since they will be unprofitable. So, security and decentralization will be gone as block rewards decreases. What happened to dogecoin will happen to bitcoin, and merged mining cannot rescue bitcoin in this case.\n\nThis is not the bitcoin I signed up for.\n\nMarginal cost of a transaction\n\nOk, so if we have a large number of transactions each paying some fees, can those fees add up to be enough to pay for the miners to secure the network?\n\nUnfortunately, no.\n\nThe bitcoin network is a zero-sum system at equilibrium: the transaction fees plus the mining block rewards must pay for the total cost of running the bitcoin network.\n\nWhen block rewards are at zero, the transaction fees must pay for it all. The design of bitcoin is that one miner receives the transaction fee but every miner must pay the cost to relay, verify and store that transaction.\n\nThis imbalanced cost-reward relationship is what prevents bitcoin from staying secure and decentralized at equilibrium if there was no transaction supply constraint.\n\nAs an example, let’s say there are 5,000 miners and nodes, and the marginal cost to process a transaction for a miner (ie verify it, add it a block and store it) is $0.0001.\n\nThe total cost on the whole network is roughly 5,000 * $0.0001, or $0.50. The average transaction fees needs to be $0.50 in order for this network to be sustainable.\n\nIf the fees were less, less efficient miners would not be able to make more than their cost and would be forced to shut down their miners and quit. This leads to less security and more centralization.\n\nThe only way to ensure that the transaction fees is enough to pay for the security and decentralization is to have block size limit act as a supply constraint for transactions.\n\nWithout a small enough block size limit, miners will mine transactions that have transaction fees more than their marginal cost but less than the total cost the network has to bear.\n\nFor example, let’s look at transaction that paid $0.01 in fees.\n\nSince it only cost the miner $0.0001 to add it, of course, he will mine that transaction. But that transaction is uneconomical for the whole network. When mined, it will hurt the network.\n\nIn contrast, if there was a block size limit, miners can only mine transactions paying the most fees. And that ensures a healthy equilibrium between transaction throughput and transaction fees.\n\nIn the end, we are just trying to figure out which dials to tweak to help bitcoin grow. The block size limit dial should be tweaked with extreme caution, as it could destroy the security and decentralization of bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is not one-size-fits-all\n\nI contend that we should design bitcoin for security and decentralization above all else.\n\nTransactions that need the highest security and decentralization will need to pay the higher transaction fees required to use the bitcoin network. Not all transactions can afford this fee, but then they likely don’t need the security and decentralization.\n\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\nThey can use litecoin and altcoins, sidechains, payment channels, the Lightning Network, off-blockchain networks, and other yet to be created networks to send those transactions.\n\nHeck, they can still use Visa if merchants are willing to pay the fees.\n\nYou would use bitcoin to buy a house or a car. A 60-minute wait and a $1 fee for an extremely secure, decentralized and irreversible transaction is perfectly fine.\n\nIf you are buying coffee and need a cheap but fast transaction and don’t care about security or decentralization, you can use litecoin, the Lightning Network, sidechains or even Starbucks off-blockchain transactions.\n\nAs long as everything is seamless, users don’t care. Transactions will be routed to the payment network that makes the most sense based on the needs of that transaction type.\n\nTechnologies like on-chain swaps, the Lightning Network, payment channels and sidechains will allow seamless and cheap and free conversions between bitcoin and everything else.\n\nWallets will hide all that complexity from users. We are not there yet, but that future is very exciting. Not every transaction will be native to bitcoin, but every person will use bitcoin.\n\n(PS I’m currently in favor of scaling Bitcoin via 2–4–8, SegWit, LN, and Validation Cost Metric).\n\nThis article originally appeared on Medium and has been reposted with the author's permission.\n\nCake image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Praised by many within the technical community, Segregated Witness is expected to improve Bitcoin's performance in a number of ways, while some even hope it might be the scaling solution that helps bring some peace back to the Bitcoin community.\n\nIn this first part of Bitcoin Magazine’s three-part series on Segregated Witness: how it works.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin transactions again?\n\nIn order to understand Segregated Witness, it is helpful to understand what Bitcoin transactions are on a more technical level. (Feel free to skip to the last section of this article if this is a familiar subject.)\n\nFor starters, it's important to realize that the Bitcoin protocol, at its core, consists of transactions. Nodes on the peer-to-peer network don't send each other bitcoin; they send each other packages that contain transaction data.\n\nThese Bitcoin transactions, in a way, are really sets of “locks.” More specifically, each transaction contains two main components. One half effectively unlocks bitcoin that were locked up in previous transactions, using pieces of data called inputs. Inputs include scripts, instructions on how to unlock the input, called scriptSigs . The other half consists of one or several new locks called outputs, which lock the same amount or less bitcoin up again. Outputs include scripts called scriptPubKeys. As such, bitcoin effectively move from inputs to outputs within a single transaction, and jump from transaction to transaction at the same time.\n\nThere is one main exception to this rule. A coinbase transaction (not to be confused by the wallet company and exchange with the same name) is the transaction created by a miner when he finds a new block, and contains the block reward: currently 25 bitcoin. Additionally, a miner can increase the coinbase reward by any amount of bitcoin that was unlocked in transactions, but not locked up again: the difference between the inputs and the outputs. These are the transaction fees.\n\nAll of this “unlocking” and “locking up” of bitcoin is done by senders of transactions, and subsequently transmitted over the Bitcoin network as packages of information. All nodes on the network, then, check whether this process of unlocking and locking up was done correctly. If everything checks out, they forward the transaction to other nodes. And if a node is also a miner, it might include the transaction in a block. Whether he actually does so is up to the miner, however; that's why it makes sense to include a fee.\n\nIt is of vital importance that the rules used by all nodes to verify transactions are compatible with the rules used by (almost) all miners. If some miners would include transactions in blocks that other nodes reject, the whole block would be considered invalid by that node. If that node is also a miner, this could lead to double spends and network forks.\n\nThese consensus rules – the rules all nodes agree on – allow transactions to lock up (and unlock) bitcoin in several different ways at once. But outputs that lock up bitcoin typically, at least, include a scriptPubKey along the lines of: “Prove that you own (or: know) the private key that corresponds to the public key that corresponds to this Bitcoin address.”\n\n(It's easy to reproduce a public key from a private key, but it's basically impossible to reproduce a private key from a public key. Similarly, it's easy to reproduce a Bitcoin address from a public key, but it's impossible to reproduce a public key from a Bitcoin address. As such, it's also easy to reproduce a Bitcoin address from a private key, but impossible to reproduce a private key from a Bitcoin address. It's a “one way street.”)\n\nThe Bitcoin address used to lock bitcoin up in the scriptPubKey, of course, is the address provided by the receiving end of the transaction. Since the receiver created that address using a private key only he knows, he is the only one who can create a valid scriptSig, and therefore the only one who can create a new transaction and spend the locked up bitcoin.\n\nWhere do signatures come in?\n\nTo prove ownership of the private key that corresponds to the public key that corresponds to a Bitcoin address, one could theoretically include the private key in the scriptSig of a transaction. But, of course, that's not safe at all. Most importantly, anyone who sees the transaction could take the private key, and create a new transaction (or change the original transaction) to attribute himself as many bitcoin as are locked up before the original transaction is included in a block. In fact, if a miner did this, it would become a piece of cake to steal bitcoin, since he's the one picking which transactions to confirm.\n\nInstead, therefore, the scriptPubKeys typically require the scriptSig to include one or more signatures in order to unlock bitcoin.\n\nSignatures are a cryptographic trick which uses a private key in combination with any other data to calculate a unique string of numbers. And, using the magic of cryptography, the corresponding public key can be used to verify that the signature was created using that private key. As such, signatures prove both ownership of a private key, as well as approval of a specific piece of data by the owner of that private key, all without actually needing to reveal the private key.\n\nIn Bitcoin's case, private keys are typically used to sign the transaction data minus the inputs. (Hence, the scriptPubKeys, the locked amounts, and some additional details.) Subsequently, this signature and the public key from which bitcoin are spent are added to the input field of the transaction. This proves that the owner of the private key really intended to create the transaction and makes sure it cannot be tampered with.\n\nThen, all of this transaction data – including the inputs this time – is hashed together, which creates the transaction ID, identifying the specific transaction. If a transaction is subsequently included in a block, the miner hashes the transaction ID together with another transaction ID to produce a new hash. And this hash is hashed again, this time along with the hash from two other transaction IDs. This process continues until there is only one hash left. This structure of hashes is called a Merkle Tree, and the remaining hash the Merkle Root . This Merkle Root is combined with additional block data to form the block header , which is used to identify the specific block. A hash of this block header, finally, must be included in the next block’s header, chaining blocks together.\n\nBitcoin is considered immutable because changing any part of any transaction retroactively would alter the transaction ID, in turn altering the block header. But this altered block header would no longer meet the proof of work requirement. And since the block header influences the make-up of subsequent block headers, neither would any of those.\n\nWhat is a Segregated Witness?\n\nThe Segregated Witness proposal as presented by Wuille in Hong Kong is based on a concept used in Blockstream's sidechain Elements, and a complementing idea by Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr. It was conceptualized over the past couple of months in cooperation with Bitcoin Core developers Gregory Maxwell and Eric Lombrozo, and might be rolled out over the next year.\n\nAs such, from the perspective of Bitcoin nodes that don't use Segregated Witness (lets call them “old nodes”), some newly created outputs might soon use a strange type of scriptPubKeys. Strange, because these scriptPubKeys can hardly be considered a lock at all. Commonly referred to as an “Anyone can spend,” these scriptPubKeys basically proclaim they don't require a signature. Additionally, they will include some meaningless text.\n\nOld nodes will consider these transactions crazy. They will think that anyone can create a new scriptSig, unlocking these outputs, meaning they're highly insecure. But at the same time, old nodes won't mind either. After all, it's not their bitcoin that's being messed around with, and other people are free to do with their bitcoin as they please. The meaningless text will be considered weird, but fine too. So they'll confirm the transactions as valid, and forward it to other nodes.\n\nHowever, Segregated Witness-enabled nodes (lets call them “new nodes”) will notice something else. They will see the otherwise meaningless text in the scriptPubKey, but not consider it meaningless at all. Instead, new nodes will recognize this piece of text as another – very special – type of output.\n\nMuch like typical outputs, this new type of output will require one or several signatures to unlock the bitcoin. But unlike typical outputs, this new type of output will not require the signature to be included in the scriptSig of a subsequent transaction. Instead, it will require the signature to be included in a completely new part of the transaction: the Segregated Witness.\n\nThis Segregated Witness is basically an “add-on” that carries signatures and some additional data. Importantly, Segregated Witnesses are completely ignored by old nodes, but recognized by new nodes. Moreover, the data they carry is not hashed along with the other parts of a transaction into the transaction ID.\n\nAs such, both old nodes and new nodes will consider transactions containing signatures in the Segregated Witness valid. Old nodes validate them because from their perspective these transactions don't require a signature at all (and they don't see one), and new nodes validate them because the required signature is in the Segregated Witness. And since both old and new nodes hash the transaction data into the same transaction ID, everyone agrees on the makeup of blocks, and, as such, on the structure of the entire blockchain.\n\n(Note that it is important that all miners – or a very large majority – should use Segregated Witness in order to prevent double spends and chain forks, or none of them should. If all miners do use Segregated Witness, old nodes on the network might wonder why some transactions aren't included in blocks, but since it was always up to miners to decide which transactions to include, and since these are not their transactions, they won't mind, either.)\n\nBut there is one problem: If signatures have no effect on the makeup of the blockchain, the blockchain no longer serves as proof that the correct signatures were included in transactions.\n\nTo make sure that signatures are embedded in the blockchain regardless, a Segregated Witness-enabled miner adds a trick, too. Rather than creating only a Merkle Tree out of all of the transactions, it also creates a Merkle Tree out of all Segregated Witnesses, to mirror the transaction tree. The Segregated Witness Merkle Root, then, is included in the input field of the coinbase transaction. As such the Segregated Witness Merkle Root changes the transaction data of the coinbase transaction, its transaction ID, therefore influences the block header and, ultimately, the makeup of the blockchain.\n\nWuille’s Segregated Witness proposal allows signatures to be removed from Bitcoin transactions, while maintaining Bitcoin's immutability, and without breaking any of the existing consensus rules.\n\nThe second part of this three-part story will explore why Segregated Witness is actually useful.\n\nThanks go out to Blockstream co-founders Pieter Wuille and Mark Friedenbach, Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo, and Blocktrail CTO Ruben de Vries for providing information and added feedback."", 'What would happen if Bitcoin was accepted on a global scale? No doubt, this is a question that has popped into every crypto-lover’s minds at one point or another, but we likely think of it for a few seconds or a few minutes and figure, “It’s just not going to happen” before we move on to our daily tasks and our minds become flooded with other things.\n\nBut seriously… What would happen? What if every country, large and small, rich and poor, suddenly stood up and declared Bitcoin completely and fully legal, and everyone was entitled to use it however they pleased? It all sounds fantastic at first… A dream scenario practically, and yet, one can’t help but wonder if there would be a downside should this ever occur.\n\nLet’s first look at things positively. It’s possible that if Bitcoin were declared legal on a global scale, and every nation saw the cryptocurrency as legit money, every bitcoin owner would become rich overnight. Globalization could likely make it spike heavily in value. Right now, we’re going crazy over the fact that Bitcoin is near the $500 mark, so imagine the heights it would hit granted every country declared it safe and use-worthy. Bitcoin owners could potentially become millionaires. Usage in China is what’s consistently “blamed” for the recent price spike that occurred in November, so imagine the numbers we would see if every country followed in China’s footsteps.\n\nBut what’s the other extreme? Is it possible that the exact opposite of the above-described situation could take place? Think of this… Every country declares Bitcoin legal, and as a result, the value heavily decreases within a matter of months or weeks. It is now no longer a unique currency. There is nothing special about it as literally everyone is using it. Therefore, the value decreases. Something uncommon garners stronger value when up against something that can be found on every street corner.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Would Bitcoin grow in price, or would it sink to the bottom? Post your thoughts and comments below.', 'ZebPay recently sent an advisory/warning note to all its users urging them not to invest in Ponzi schemes like MMM. The note also warns the users against using ZebPay’s services for such schemes.\n\nTry going to a nearby park to ask people about Bitcoin, and you will be surprised to realize how little people actually know about it. While some people are more knowledgeable about Bitcoin, others aren’t–most of them would say that Bitcoin is some form of digital currency that is volatile in nature. Some might go a bit further to say that bitcoin is a form of money that is used to buy drugs online.\n\nMost of these people do not have complete understanding of the digital currency and how it works. Armed with partial information, they make easy prey for con-men who convince them to invest in various scams like Ponzi and Pyramid schemes by promising them great returns, which someone with sound knowledge about digital currency and basic understanding of investments will easily recognize.\n\nThe number of Ponzi and Pyramid schemes involving Bitcoin are on the rise, and to make it more convincing, the people behind these schemes sometimes use a few well-known names in the industry. ZebPay, a leading Indian mobile Bitcoin wallet and marketplace, has issued an advisory to all its users to prevent them from becoming victims of such scams. The notice was sent out as a mailer, and it warns ZebPay users especially about MMM, a previous well-known Ponzi scheme which has resurfaced in recent days. Unlike the previous scams, the current MMM offering deals with bitcoins, and it has already garnered a lot of attention among Chinese Bitcoin users.\n\nWhile we do not possess enough solid information to comment on the legitimacy and validity of the current scheme, we are forced to go by MMM’s previous track record in Russia, where it was forcibly shut down by law enforcement authorities in 1994. The man behind MMM, Sergei Mavrodi, was arrested and placed in custody in 2003 and convicted of fraud in 2007. He collectively served a prison sentence of four and half years before his release in 2007 after accounting for his days in prison since arrest as time served.\n\nSince then, Sergei Mavrodi has started MMM-2011, another alleged Ponzi scheme which has gained a lot of participation from Asian and African countries despite repeated warnings from governments. ZebPay’s notification advises its user to refrain from taking part/investing in the new MMM scheme and any other similar schemes. It also distances itself from any possible unauthorized usage of ZebPay’s name by the operators of such schemes in the near future.\n\nWhen asked about any instances where MMM or other scams have made unauthorized usage of ZebPay’s name, Saurabh Agarwal, the co-founder of Zebpay, told NewsBTC that they were never in such a situation.\n\n“We had sent a cautionary message to all users on ZebPay. We believe that regular users are not always aware of [the] negatives of investing in such dubious schemes, and as a responsible company, it is our duty to warn our users.”\n\nThe notice ensures that all ZebPay users have been adequately warned about MMM and other scams.', 'Cheap Christmas Lights Review (B&M Stores), What to Expect - Video\n\nThis is a review of cheap outdoor Christmas lights such as by B&M Stores (Diamond Berry and similar), these lights are made exclusively for B&M Stores comprising 80 multi-coloured LED bulbs, of what use you can expect over 2 Christmas.\n\nIts 3 weeks since installation and about 10 bulbs in the berry lights have already stopped working.\n\nIts now week 4 and the berry lights are now much worse as another 10 bulbs have become dimmer.\n\nSecond Christmas - And only about 1/3rd of the bulbs are working.\n\nIt’s now 3 weeks later and less than half of the bulbs are working, so the BM Store diamond berry or similar lights are not really designed to last beyond the first Christmas which means to expect about 1 months proper use for the first Christmas only.\n\nRemember to subscribe this youtube channel for NEW reviews.\n\nBy Anika Walayat\n\nhttp://www.howtoguidesandreviews.com\n\n\n\nhttp://www.marketoracle.co.uk\n\nCopyright © 2005-2015 Marketoracle.co.uk (Market Oracle Ltd).

12/20/2015,"['We have 10 more days to go for the new year. This year has been great for Bitcoin and Bitcoiners—we hope you were among them, too. In one of our previous articles, we discussed the progress of Bitcoin over 2015. While the Bitcoin sector has had its share of ups and downs during the year, it has made good overall progress. Now it is time to have a look at what might be in store for the digital currency in the coming year.\n\nThe adoption of bitcoin among individuals has been good in 2015, and we can expect the same thing to continue in the coming year, as well. The development of products and services using blockchain technology has been on a full swing in recent days, and the potential of this technology has attracted a lot of investments from various venture capitalists and the fintech industry alike. As the year 2016 progresses, we can expect many of the much-awaited products to hit the market.\n\nOn the technical side, some of the major developments are slated to happen during 2016. Come 2016, it will be 8 years since Bitcoin came into existence. It also means that the mining reward per block will be halved for a second time, right on schedule. Earlier rewards for block discovery were set at 50 bitcoins, then halved to 25 in the year 2012. In 2016, the rewards will be further halved to 12.5 per block discovery. This may lead to further increases in the value of Bitcoin itself, to compensate for the demand. It also means that mining operations will undergo major overhaul, rendering a lot of previous-generation ASICs and miners obsolete.\n\nThe bitcoin network is already experiencing a considerable increase in transaction volumes, leading to slower confirmations and increased backlog. These issues are likely to worsen unless the block size is increased from the existing 1 MB to something much bigger. The only way to do it is by all the parties reaching consensus, which is quite possible in 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, the cryptocurrency may soon find its way to Wall Street as a commodity to be traded, which may happen sooner or later, says Barry Silbert from Digital Currency Group. The banking consortium of over 30 banks is involved with R3, a New York based fintech startup to develop a blockchain network for all the partner banks. The blockchain network is intended to circumvent the existing SWIFT network to facilitate cheaper and faster fund transfers between branches across the world.\n\nThere has been a considerable increase in investments being channeled towards Bitcoin and blockchain-based startups. While the same will continue in 2016 as well, the segment might soon get overcrowded later in the year. The progression will lead to the creation of a Bitcoin startup bubble that will eventually burst, taking some down with it while the bigger, more established companies will make it through and acquire the under-performing ones with products that align with their vision.\n\nThe next year to come will be a bumpy ride, nevertheless. Regulations are another aspect that needs to be accounted for. Many countries have so far kept themselves away from cryptocurrency sector, but they may soon switch from being observers to becoming enforcers by introducing regulations governing the usage of such currencies.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Travis Patron is the founder of Diginomics, a bitcoin news organization where professionals can enroll in the Bitcoin Economics Course. Here he explains why the stateless nature of bitcoin holds the potential to solve an age-old international monetary flaw.\n\nAlthough the United States Federal Reserve Note carries with it many advantages for conducting commerce and serving as a world reserve currency, its makeup is not void of imperfections.\n\nOne of the main shortcomings of the US dollar is the Triffin dilemma, a problem which arises when countries must manage both short term domestic and long term international economic objectives.\n\nSuch a dilemma can lead to trade deficits when a country must also satisfy international demand of its currency.\n\nWhere the dollar falls victim to the Triffin dilemma, however, the stateless characteristics of bitcoin may hold promise to solve this international monetary flaw, and provide the backbone for a more interdependent global economy.\n\nThe Triffin dilemma\n\nThe economist Robert Triffin first brought to light an international monetary issue involving the nation holding reserve currency status and the impact such a role would have on domestic trade deficits.\n\nSuch a currency arrangement is usually cited to articulate the problems with the role of the dollar as the reserve currency under the Bretton Woods system.\n\nThe countries issuing a reserve currency, which foreign nations would wish to hold, must be willing to supply extra money stock to fulfill global demand. Such an arrangement would inevitably lead to operating a trade deficit.\n\nIn March of 2009, in the midst of the recent Great Recession, the People\'s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan voiced his displeasure of the current makeup of the world reserve currency.\n\nKnown for his reformist tendencies, Xiaochuan made clear the need for creating ""an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations"". Such an international reserve currency, he insisted, could provide stable value, rule-based issuance, and manageable supply necessary for achieving prolonged financial prosperity.\n\nZhou Xiaochuan\'s proposal went largely unheard, as economists were not clear if the International Monetary Fund\'s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) had the global adoption to overtake the dollar. No solutions have since been proposed.\n\nYet is it possible that such a ""disconnected international reserve currency"" has been in circulation since 2009? Is it possible that bitcoin could act as a domestically disconnected money supply and therefore solve the Triffin Dilemma?\n\nJohn Nash on the Triffin Dilemma\n\nThe late mathematician John Nash, whom some believe to be a contributor to the invention of bitcoin, was also an advocate of monetary reform in order to solve the Triffin Dilemma.\n\nThe desirable goal, in Nash\'s mind, was to create an international reserve instrument capable of operating independent of individual nation states while remaining stable in the long run, severing deficiencies found in credit-based money.\n\nSuch a money supply would be able to provide a national savings outlet while operating in an autonomous, global manner. With an obsessive focus on cryptography and ideal money, the introduction of bitcoin is covered with the fingerprints of John Nash.\n\nCan Bitcoin Solve the Triffin Dilemma?\n\nThe Triffin Dilemma, where countries issuing reserve currencies attempt to simultaneously manage national savings levels with necessary international liquidity, continues to act as a barrier to economic growth. However, could it be that the introduction of bitcoin brings forth a viable solution to the Triffin Dilemma?\n\nIf we assume that the prerequisites for a currency capable of solving the Triffin dilemma were to provide the following, it may be possible to argue that bitcoin is the perfect fit.\n\nStable value Rule-based issuance Manageable supply schedule\n\nIn a recent analysis of the price volatility of bitcoin, Eli Dourado estimates that the stability of bitcoin could match that of the Euro within 15 years. Largely a product of an increasing number of active users, the Federal Reserve Board of Washington also estimates that the userbase of bitcoin is doubling roughly every eight months.\n\nRule-based issuance is perhaps the most interesting aspect of the bitcoin economy. Here, we have a paradigm shift in the management of monetary policy.\n\nWhere central banking and human decision making were the catalysts for monetary policy in the 20th century, that role is now filled by algorithmic time-bound issuance with cryptocurrency. A computerized function on the issuance of money has the potential to provide a sound basis for monetary policy because it is magnitudes more capable of adjusting to changing externalities, such as the bitcoin mining hash power index.\n\nFinally, the supply schedule of bitcoin is relatively inelastic compared to traditional forms of money. We can predict with a high degree of accuracy the supply of bitcoin at any point in time (past & future) and make the necessary adjustments in domestic policy.\n\nPeter Šurda, an economist from Vienna, Austria, argues that the inelastic supply function of bitcoin could result in a reduction of business cycles on a domestic level. This inelastic function of bitcoin\'s monetary supply could allow both domestic governments and businesses to forecast changes with a higher degree of accuracy, and therefore, could quite possibly mitigate the destructive nature of the business cycle.\n\nTruly, as bitcoin gains new users in the form of individuals learning about cryptocurrency, transacting it, and crossing the psychological chasm of viewing it as a valid form of payment, it inches closer to its rightful place as a global reserve instrument. Such an instrument would hold tremendous potential to solve the age-old Triffin dilemma.\n\nBusinessman dilemma via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Do veteran cryptocurrency observers find something a bit strange in this? Can you really have the blockchain without cryptocurrency?\n\nRupert Hackett, community manager of Australia-based buyabitcoin.com.au, tackles this question head-on in an opinion piece in Venture Beat. He observes that initially, banks and financial institutions ignored cryptocurrency since they recognized it as a competitor to traditional money and claimed (incorrectly) that it would simply go away. As time progressed, bitcoin expanded. Ignoring the disruptive technology wasn’t going to work.\n\nBanks Respond To A Challenge\n\nHackett claims the reason banks are now so interested in blockchain technology is they see it as a way to respond to the competitive threat that bitcoin poses to traditional money. While many financial institutions now claim to be interested in blockchain technology but not bitcoin, they ignore the fact that you need a cryptocurrency to make a blockchain. Hackett postulates that hyping the blockchain while denigrating bitcoin is an effort to blunt bitcoin’s challenge to traditional currency.\n\nBanks and the national governments that regulate traditional currency recognize cryptocurrency as one of the very few alternatives seen in centuries that can securely and efficiently create and handle money beyond the control of banks and governments.\n\nThe implementation of bitcoin creates a decentralized trust, which is a bank’s main asset, Hackett says. It also challenges governments’ money-minting monopoly.\n\nBecause bitcoin is decentralized, banks’ traditional ways of battling competition such as through legislation or intimidation won’t work. So instead, they are accommodating the block chain to use it as a defense against bitcoin.\n\nNow banks, hedge funds and fintech companies are heralding the blockchain, claiming it is positioned to change the future of finance by improving its efficiency and security.\n\nWhy Do Banks Diss Bitcoin?\n\nIn the process of making these claims, the financial institutions have attempted to sideline bitcoin as not worthy of serious discussion. Hackett observes these discussions ignore the fact that a blockchain cannot be created without digital currency. The claim that you’re “big on blockchain but not bitcoin” implies you want the innovation without the decentralization, Hackett says, a separation he claims has not been proven possible.\n\nHackett notes that some observers are wondering if the current hype is a calculated play to sap bitcoin’s growth so it will not be disruptive enough to compromise the strength of major financial sector players.\n\nHe further notes that bitcoin author Andreas Antonopoulos characterized the banking industry’s attention to blockchain in a recent Google Hangout interview with Paul Buitink, the Dutch bitcoin advocate. Antonopoulos said the banks want to adopt the efficiencies without the decentralization, the global nature but with censorship, and the low cost but with control. He further said one can’t have bitcoin’s revolutionary nature while removing all the things that make it innovative.\n\nBanks want to disrupt their industry, Antonopoulos said, but when presented with a real disruptive technology, they “run away screaming.” In reality, the banks can’t imagine disruption that changes the fundamental principles of what they do.\n\nAlso read: Chain partners with Nasdaq to bring block chain technology to the private market\n\nRewards Are Intrinsic To Blockchain\n\nHackett said a reward mechanism is intrinsic to a blockchain’s functionality. Rewards are distributed randomly to agents known as miners in return for securing the blockchain. The innovation in this is that no mining group will gain full control over the blockchain’s security since it would disenfranchise itself. The only way to have a blockchain is to incentivize the miners to operate in a self-enforcing, distributed manner.\n\nWithout a cryptocurrency, the blockchain will not adhere to the vision established by bitcoin’s creator.\n\nHackett says no one has shown how a blockchain without an incentive system would be more revolutionary than the one driven by bitcoin.\n\nHe concludes by comparing bitcoin and the block chain to soccer. You do not stop a soccer ball by standing in its way, but by taking the momentum out of it by moving with it in the direction it is going.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

12/21/2015,"['Tone Vays is a well-known trader in the bitcoin space who previously worked at Bear Stearns and JP Morgan. Vays is currently head of research at Brave New Coin, and he was featured on a panel regarding the pros and cons of investing in Bitcoin at last week’s Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego.\n\n[Read More: TechCrunch Disrupt Panel Discusses Bitcoin vs Blockchain]\n\nDuring the panel discussion, the participants were asked for their opinions on the Bitcoin versus blockchain debate. Not one to hold his tongue, Vays let it be known that he doesn’t see how private blockchains will offer any revolutionary changes to the world of finance.\n\nHow Useful is a Private Blockchain?\n\nOne of the key points multiple individuals, from Xapo CEO Wences Casares to Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen, have mentioned when it comes to private blockchains is that these solutions aren’t much different from traditional database technologies. In fact, a synchronized MySQL server may make more sense than a blockchain when decentralization is not a top priority.\n\nTone Vays hinted at this issue during the recent panel discussion, as he noted there isn’t much of a point to blocks in a private blockchain. He stated:\n\n“I’m still waiting for the day they’re going to figure out, and it’s going to be soon, that the whole concept of blocks will be irrelevant when you take bitcoin out of it. So very soon it’s just going to be chain.”\n\nBlocks allow bitcoin miners to be rewarded for their work via block rewards and transaction fees, and their usefulness becomes a bit unclear when miners are taken out of the equation.\n\n[Read More: Brock Pierce: Consumers Don’t Care About Bitcoin, They Care About Faster and Better]\n\nBlockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce was also featured on the panel, and he made the point that private blockchains are similar to Intranets. Vays agreed with this point and stated:\n\n“I like Brock [Pierce’s] point about Intranets and Internet. I’ve worked at a lot of financial firms in New York — Bear Stearns, JP Morgan — they all have Intranets and they’re all important, but they’re all pretty much useless outside of that institution.”\n\nBitcoin Offers Regulatory Arbitrage\n\nIn Tone Vays’s eyes, the main differentiator between Bitcoin and private blockchains is Bitcoin’s ability to offer regulatory arbitrage. In the world of legally-questionable technologies, history shows that anything able to be regulated will be regulated or shut down. Liberty Reserve, E-gold, and Napster are clear examples of this point.\n\nTone Vays went into detail on the importance of Bitcoin’s ability to provide regulatory arbitrage:\n\n“Bitcoin [the commodity] itself is the revolution. It’s an asset, like I mentioned earlier. The asset creates regulatory arbitrage, which is a new term I love using. If you’re not building something that involves blockchain, Bitcoin, or whatever you want to call it — if you’re not utilizing the regulatory arbitrage property of Bitcoin, I believe you’re wasting your time because — whatever it is — R3 CEV, Chain, or anyone of them are doing — once it becomes useful, I don’t understand why the finance people at SWIFT and the developers at Oracle can’t just get together and build something that executes faster because they are not, R3 CEV is not, going to build anything to get around regulations.”\n\nBitcoin’s decentralization and permissionless nature are two core principles that are not found in any other digital payment system. These are two valuable aspects of the Bitcoin network, and they are enabled by the mining process, which is incentivized through bitcoin rewards.\n\n[Read More: Patrick Byrne Sees Bank Blockchain Consortium R3 as an Attempt at Regulatory Protectionism]\n\nFollowing in Airbnb and Uber’s Footsteps\n\nTone Vays also believes Bitcoin has the ability to get around regulations in a manner similar to Airbnb and Uber. He explained:\n\n“We have companies like Airbnb and Uber that took off for one reason: They got around regulations. Airbnb got around hotel regulations. Uber got around taxi regulations. This is what the Bitcoin blockchain will do, and if you are not utilizing this concept of getting around stifling regulation, you’re just speeding up settlement. So you save a little bit of money and you cut away some of your middlemen in your office, but you’re not revolutionizing anything.”\n\nWhile Airbnb and Uber are still very much centralized services, the utility offered to their users created enough demand for their existence to completely change the way taxi and hotel regulations work in many jurisdictions. In the case of Bitcoin, the number of users on the network is important, but it is not the end-all-be-all of whether or not the system will survive. The fact that the network is decentralized with no single point of failure is what protects Bitcoin from regulations and censorship in the long run.\n\n[Read More: Some Bitcoin Startups are Rebranding as Blockchain Companies, But They’re Still Using Bitcoin]\n\nBitcoin Core Has the Best Developers\n\nOne final point made by Tone Vays regarding the Bitcoin versus blockchain debate is that Bitcoin Core has the best developers. Some of these guys have been working on the Bitcoin blockchain since 2010 or 2011, and not many of them are defecting to work on private blockchains at large financial institutions. Vays noted:\n\n“The best developers in the space are working for Bitcoin Core. They’re the best developers. There’s nobody they can hire. I mean, these companies like R3 CEV . . . they will hire failed Bitcoin Core developers, and I’m not going to name any names, but they did hire one recently. So I really don’t expect much from it.”\n\nIt would seem that the “failed” Bitcoin Core developer Vays is referring to is Mike Hearn, who worked at Google before working full-time on Bitcoin. Hearn recently launched an alternative implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoin XT, with Gavin Andresen.\n\n[Read More: Gavin Andresen: I am Confident the Bitcoin Block Size Issue Will Get Solved]\n\nOnly time will tell if there is any use for private blockchains in the real world, but it seems clear that there will be a use for the decentralized, permissionless Bitcoin blockchain for the foreseeable future. For now, it appears that any private blockchain will not be able to offer the same properties as Bitcoin, but then again, these new, permissioned ledgers are not necessarily meant to compete with Bitcoin.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011. His work has been featured on VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, RT’s Keiser Report, and many other media outlets.

The patents haven’t been granted yet, but the filings demonstrate the bank’s interest in using blockchain technology to revamp its backend operations, which, like other financial institutions, are largely paper-based.\n\nThe wide-ranging patents cover everything from a “cryptocurrency transaction payment system” which would let users make transactions using cryptocurrency, to risk detection, storing cryptocurrencies offline, and using the blockchain to measure fraudulent activity. (The blockchain is essentially a publicly available ledger that’s distributed to everyone within a network.)\n\nBank of America had no comment.\n\nFinancial institutions are quickly ramping up their research efforts around blockchain technology. Last week, IBM, JPMorgan, the London Stock Exchange, and Wells Fargo announced the Open Ledger Project, a new consortium that will focus on allowing businesses to easily build their own blockchain technology. Bank of America is a part of a consortium led by blockchain startup R3 that’s developing blockchain technology to be used in financial markets. The Aite Group estimates that banks have invested $75 million this year on blockchain tech, a figure the research firm forecasts will grow to $400 million in 2019.\n\nOther financial institutions have been building up their blockchain-related intellectual property. Goldman Sachs filed a patent for its own cryptocurrency, SETLCoin, that would allow traders to execute and clear trades in real time.\n\nIt’s hard to speculate what Bank of America will do with these patents, if anything. But Coindesk notes these patents could be hinting at BofA working on a complete network based on blockchain.', 'Confirming that there’s a sucker born every minute, Bitcoin mining outfit BTCS, Inc. has raised $1.4 million in a post-IPO equity round led by Cavalry Fund LP.\n\nThe funding comes after news via way of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing in November that detailed that the company was in serious financial strife and was literally running out of money.\n\nAs we reported at the time:\n\nProving that you can apparently never burn money quickly enough, the company … reported a net loss of $3.8 million in the previous quarter, and $8.4 million year-to-date to September 30, up from a $2.5 million quarterly loss for the same quarter in 2014 on a $6.6m year-to-date net loss.\n\nIt wasn’t just the figures that indicated it was in trouble, but the company itself, who noted in the report that “Because of recurring operating losses, net operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”\n\nBTCS was originally founded as a Blockchain focused e-commerce fintech provider before shifting its business model to Bitcoin mining in late 2014 at a time where the price of Bitcoin started to fall and existing, bigger, Bitcoin miners started going out of business.\n\nAccording to a report from Finance Magnates the company has also entered into a merger agreement with Israel-based Bitcoin mining hardware provider Spondoolies-Tech; $750,000 from the new investment is said going toward additional investment in Spondoolies, raising BTCS’s stake to 9.6%.\n\nInsanity\n\nBTCS did note in November that it was trying to raise capital to continue trading and to their credit they have done so, but it’s still pure insanity to throw $1.4 million at a company that has a beyond abysmal record when it comes to running a business, one where they are burning money while failing to actually bring in needed revenue to replace it.\n\nWhile the company’s November financials did note that it made $67,000 profit after costs on its Bitcoin mining operations for the year-to-date to September, that won’t necessarily now scale with the additional funding; while the price of Bitcoin has improved this year increasing the potential financial returns from the process, at the same time the cost of Bitcoin mining itself is also rapidly increasing with the difficulty of mining having increased by 41.9 percent over the last 30 days according to data from Kaiko meaning that more computing power is required to mine for the same amount of Bitcoins.\n\nShares in BTCS, which is listed on the Other The Counter (OTC) board dropped 1.87 percent to 10 cents a share on the news, and is down from 12 cents it was trading at in November.', 'As bitcoin continues to grow in popularity, some degree of regulation seems inevitable. In this context, the concept of bitcoin friendliness reflects as much the type of regulation as its mere existence. Regulation generally focuses on some combination of the following: (1) bitcoin exchanges, which facilitate transactions, often speculative, to buy and sell it versus other currencies; (2) bitcoin wire transfers, which can be domestic or international; and (3) purchases and sales of goods and services.\n\nMoney transfer has been a particular area of growth for bitcoin as it challenges banks, Western Union and Wal-Mart by offering faster and cheaper transfers. In some states, the lack of new, bitcoin-specific regulation means bitcoin falls by default under existing money-transfer laws, which can be more onerous. As of December 2015, following are the five states most friendly toward bitcoin, listed in alphabetical order.\n\n1. California\n\nBitcoin was officially recognized as legal tender in June 2014 when Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 129. California law previously banned any alternative store of value such as points or coupons. While digital currencies were not being targeted under the old law, there were concerns it could happen in the future.\n\nSan Francisco is considered the world\'s most bitcoin-friendly city with 177 merchants that accept it for payment as of April 2015. Los Angeles is not far behind with 170 accepting merchants, but with more than 20 times the population of its northern neighbor, it lags far behind on a per capita basis.\n\nCalifornia\'s Department of Business Oversight, which oversees many financial service providers in the state, has expressed concern regarding the risk to consumers of investing in digital currencies. It seems likely there will be ongoing regulatory changes so money transfer rules reflect the new types of payment structures.\n\nSilicon Valley is home to several major bitcoin exchanges including Coinbase and Kraken Bitcoin Exchange. The importance of the tech industry makes it likely California will remain very bitcoin-friendly, although regulation continues to evolve.\n\n2. Colorado\n\nIt is legal to grow marijuana in Colorado, and recreational use is permitted. The dispensaries that sell it, however, have not been able to open bank accounts for a range of reasons that essentially come back to the fact marijuana is not legal under federal laws. The state has been trying to set up a credit union for the industry called The Fourth Corner, but it has been stymied by the National Credit Union Association and the Federal Reserve Bank. This has generally limited businesses to dealing in cash plus bitcoin and other digital currencies, with the latter alternative providing the paper trail businesses need as well as improved safety. Denver lists 56 merchants that accept bitcoin payments.\n\n3. New York\n\nIt may seem surprising to include New York on this list given the outcry from some exchanges regarding the BitLicense they have been required to obtain to do business in the state since August 2015. Bitstamp, which did get the license, estimated the application cost at roughly $100,000, although the license itself only cost $5,000.\n\nQuite a few companies chose to exit the state including Kraken and Bitfinex. However, most of the best-funded companies chose to get licensed and stay, or continue to do business there even though they are based elsewhere, including Coinbase, Circle, 21 Inc. and Bitreserve. Several companies that chose to be licensed indicated they consider it an important step to boost consumer confidence and bring bitcoin into the mainstream. With the New York Stock Exchange and Goldman Sachs among the investors in some new exchanges, it is not surprising they are willing to trade a license for increased profit potential. New York City has 149 vendors that accept bitcoin payments, which is second only to Los Angeles and five bitcoin ATMs.\n\n4. New Hampshire\n\nThe small state of New Hampshire does not have any exchanges, but it is home to Lamassu, a company that makes bitcoin ATMs that have been shipped around the world. The state also has a strong Libertarian bent. Its state motto is ""Live Free or Die,"" and that fits well with the ethos that led to the beginning of bitcoin. There are no limitations on making purchases in bitcoin, and the state reportedly has the most per capital bitcoin purchases in the United States. Effective Jan. 1, 2016, however, digital currency wire transmissions and purchases or sales beyond personal use will be covered by the existing money transfer regulations. This means a license is required.\n\n5. Texas\n\nTexas has a strong independent streak, reflecting at least in part its former, brief identity as an independent republic before joining the United States. Under regulations published by the state\'s Department of Banking in April 2014, digital currencies such as bitcoin are not considered money. This means wire transfers and purchases or sales are not subject to the regulations that govern equivalent transactions in dollars. Such regulations will take effect, however, if there is an in-state exchange that trades bitcoin for dollars or other legal tender. Two of the top 10 cities in the United States for vendor acceptance are in Texas. Dallas is number three with 104, and Austin is number six with 84.', 'Marco Santori is a blockchain and bitcoin specialist who leads the FinTech practice at law firm Cooley LLP.\n\nHe is also the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s Regulatory Affairs Committee and author of CoinDesk\'s series on bitcoin law (find parts 1, 2 and 3 here).\n\nNot a single month passed in 2015 without some groundbreaking new development in the world of digital currency regulation.\n\nI’ll count down some of the ones that have been most influential on my own practice.\n\n10. New Jersey: The Digital Currency Jobs Creation Act\n\nIn June, the New Jersey Digital Currency Jobs Creation Act was introduced into the New Jersey Legislature. 2015 brought us the beginnings of several new state initiatives, but this bill is the first to offer both carrots and sticks to digital currency businesses.\n\nThe sticks are modest: Instead of applying for a license, a digital currency business need only register with the state. The carrots are significant: significant tax breaks and fast-tracked operational incentives. (In full disclosure, I was honored to be chosen to draft the text of the act).\n\nAs of this writing, the legislation is still being considered in the state.\n\n9. Hong Kong: No Need for Bitcoin Regulation\n\nIn March, the Hong Kong government laid to rest some concerns that the jurisdiction would crack down on digital currencies, when it released official guidance stating that bitcoins ""do not pose a significant threat to the financial system"".\n\nThus, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury concluded ""there is no need to introduce legislation to regulate virtual commodities trading or to prohibit people from participating in such activities"".\n\nHong Kong is a local hub of digital currency activity, and this affirmative statement provides much-needed certainty to the businesses operating there.\n\n8. CFTC: Bitcoins are Commodities\n\nSince 2013, we’ve known that, for the purposes of anti-money laundering regulation, the federal government considers bitcoin to be a currency. But, in September, the Commodity Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) announced its first civil enforcement action against a bitcoin options trading platform, Coinflip.\n\nIn doing so, CFTC confirmed what many within the community had long believed: CFTC considers bitcoin to be a commodity subject to its supervision. As a result, Coinflip was liable for failing to register its bitcoin options exchange as a swap facility.\n\nWe can now expect CFTC to exercise oversight over bitcoin derivatives as well as mischief in their markets.\n\n7. BSA Audits: FinCEN is Serious about AML Enforcement\n\nIf there were any doubt that the US federal government is serious about enforcing its digital currency regulations, 2015 put those doubts to rest. In May, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) announced its first round of Bank Secrecy Act audits of those companies which had registered as money transmitters in digital currencies.\n\nFinCEN delegates its investigative activity for anti-money laundering (AML) violations to the Internal Revenue Service, which – as of this year – is now conducting regular audits of digital currency companies to ensure compliance.\n\nMultiple companies in the space have reported that they are, in fact, under audit.\n\n6. California: A License for Digital Currency Businesses\n\nWhen it comes to moving money, or when it comes to technology, California is among the most important jurisdictions in the US.\n\nYet, it has refused to license bitcoin companies, refused to enforce its existing money transmission licensing laws against bitcoin companies operating in the state and refused to interpret how those laws might apply to the bitcoin industry in general.\n\nFinally, in March, the state introduced AB 1326, an act that would explicitly bring bitcoin companies under licensing guidelines.\n\nThe bill has passed the California Assembly and will be reintroduced into the California Senate when it reconvenes in 2016.\n\n5. SEC: Some Mining Contracts Are Securities\n\nJust this month, we learned that bitcoin mining contracts can be securities, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn its enforcement action against Josh Homero Garza and his bitcoin mining company, GAW Miners, the SEC alleged that Garza and GAW were engaged in a Ponzi scheme where they sold contracts called \'Hashlets\' to the public.\n\nThe agency explicitly alleged that the Hashlets were securities regulated under the Securities Act, and therefore the SEC had jurisdiction over the fraud.\n\nThe SEC went out of its way to note that not all mining contracts are securities, and described the particular characteristics of the Hashlets that crossed the line.\n\n4. New York: The BitLicense\n\nIf you’ve been following one story in bitcoin law this year, it’s probably been the \'BitLicense\'.\n\nThe BitLicense is the media-friendly name for an amendment to New York’s money services laws that sought to create a brand new technology license for bitcoin and other virtual currency companies operating in the state.\n\nThe BitLicense saga began in 2013, when the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) rolled out the red carpet for the glitterati of the bitcoin industry to offer their testimony on the new proposal.\n\nThe project was first welcomed by many as a shining badge of legitimacy for the industry. For some, though, it began to lose its luster in 2015, when it became clear that the language of the license would prove vague and ultimately over-inclusive.\n\nThe final license became effective in August of this year.\n\n3. ItBit: An Alternative to the BitLicense\n\nWhere some zigged, others zagged.\n\nIn addition to offering a BitLicense, New York provided an alternative route to operating legally in the state. In 2015, the NYDFS awarded its first trust charter to a bitcoin business: the bitcoin exchange operated by itBit.\n\nThe trust structure puts itBit in a different position than that of a BitLicensee.\n\nFor example, where a BitLicense holder could merely take custody of a client’s bitcoins, itBit must act as a fiduciary to its clients, putting their interests above its own.\n\n2. ECJ Bitcoin Sales Are Not Subject to VAT\n\nIn October, the European Court of Justice ruled definitively that sales of bitcoin are exempt from VAT. Following an initial dispute between a member of the bitcoin community and Sweden’s tax office, the European court first addressed the bitcoin taxation issue in June of last year.\n\nThe matter was elevated to the European court after a Swedish court found against the tax office and ruled bitcoin transactions there should be exempt from VAT.\n\nHad the court decided otherwise, retail bitcoin activity might have been all but snuffed out in Europe.\n\n1. UK Treasury: AML Rules for Wallets and Prudential Regulations for Exchanges\n\nIt may be a controversial call, but I believe the most important regulatory development of 2015 came from the UK.\n\nIn response to a call for comments, the UK Treasury announced in March that it plans to require digital currency exchanges in the UK to implement AML standards similar to other regulated financial intermediaries.\n\nHowever, the prudential requirements (like minimum capitalization requirements and bonding) applicable to some financial services companies will only apply to custodial operations, and will be opt-in. Custodians won’t be required by law to satisfy the requirements, but those who do can tout a presumably confidence-inspiring \'seal of approval\' developed by the British Standards Institute.\n\nThis places UK businesses under a very different – and frankly much more reasonable – regime than their neighbors across the Atlantic.\n\n2016: What to expect?\n\nIf 2016 proves itself even half as interesting as 2015, the industry is in for an eventful year. I can think of at least two developments to anticipate in 2016.\n\nFirst, I predict we will see a federal Virtual Currency Transaction Report or VCTR. Admittedly, this is more of a report than a prediction, since FinCEN has suggested as much in informal comments.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin exchanges and custodial wallets must report any cash or coin (paper or metal) transactions above $10,000 in a so-called Currency Transaction Report (CTR). Because few digital currency companies have a brick-and-mortar presence, the industry as a whole files few CTRs.\n\nThis represents a blind spot in FinCEN’s financial surveillance. FinCEN has already dropped hints that it is considering extending the CTR requirement to bitcoin. We might see that as soon as this year. It might even be a part of a more comprehensive rulemaking.\n\nSecond, we will see states start to make laws concerning not only digital currency businesses, but also blockchain technology businesses. A tremendous amount of capital is flowing into the blockchain tech space.\n\nI believe that states will begin making attempts to capture some of this revenue by offering incentives to businesses to home within their borders.\n\nComputer law image via Shutterstock\n\nWant to share your opinion on bitcoin or blockchain in 2015, or a prediction for the year ahead?

The digital currency does not have a home market and is not regulated by any single central bank, so the exchanges are spread around the world. In the wake of terrorist attacks and security concerns, there is a growing trend to regulate the exchanges, move them under the purview of banking regulators and limit anonymity. Some exchanges are limiting where they choose to accept customers, but the pro-regulation move seems likely to accelerate.\n\nThe biggest development in the bitcoin exchange universe was the Mt. Gox fraud and bankruptcy in February 2014. The Japan-based exchange had commanded about 80% of the bitcoin-dollar market, so its collapse opened the door to the growth of other exchanges even as trading volume temporarily collapsed. Reports surfaced in October 2015 that the smaller Belize-registered Cryptsy exchange might be having similar problems, with some users reporting issues withdrawing funds. Cryptsy remains functional at present. The following is a look at five of the active bitcoin exchanges in alphabetical order.\n\n1. Bitfinex\n\nHong Kong-based Bitfinex claims on its website to be the most liquid exchange in the world, but it has had its ups and downs in 2015. On Aug. 19, 2015, there was a ""flash crash"" of 29% in the bitcoin price on the Bitfinex exchange, while prices were driven down 14% elsewhere. The Bitfinex price quickly bounced back to match prices on other exchanges, but the sharp move was enough to spook the market.\n\nThe crash was reportedly caused by several leveraged positions being closed out simultaneously, which squeezed liquidity. Bitfinex includes a peer-to-peer margin function, which allows traders up to 3.3 times leverage. When margin calls were triggered, this seems to have caused the sharp sell-off.\n\nThe exchange also announced in August 2015 it would not be applying for the New York\'s new BitLicense, which is going to be required for exchanges operating in that state. As a result, it no longer accepts deposits with New York state addresses.\n\n2. Bitstamp\n\nBitstamp is based in both Slovenia, home of its young founders Nejc Kodric and Damian Merlak, and the United Kingdom. It was the third-largest exchange in the world in early 2015, but hacks have reportedly cost it $5.1 million. The hacks were apparently executed via phishing expeditions that allowed the thieves to access the hot wallets connected to the Internet. Fortunately, most of its currency was stored in so-called cold wallets: local hard drives that cannot be accessed.\n\nThe exchange closed for several days in January and incurred an estimated $2 million in expenses, beyond the theft itself, to track the thieves and sharply improve security. It is unclear how many customers it lost as a result.\n\n3. Coinbase\n\nCoinbase was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, and is based in San Francisco, California. It is both a wallet and an exchange, and it is one of the most popular ways of investing in bitcoin. Coinbase operates in 19 countries and 33 states; the company has indicated it will operate as a licensed and regulated exchange. Following a successful $75 million round of funding in January 2015, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is among its investors.\n\nCoinbase launched the first bitcoin debit card in November 2015, although it is still in a testing phase. The debit card is legal in 25 states and can be used at any retail establishment that accepts Visa cards. The company has emphasized it will work with regulators. It is also one of only two exchanges, along with Kraken, that has been incorporated into Bloomberg\'s terminals, which are widely used by currency traders.\n\n4. Gemini\n\nThe Gemini Exchange was founded by the Winklevoss twins, best known for their long-running dispute with Mark Zuckerberg, whom they accused of stealing their idea for Facebook. The exchange debuted Oct. 8, 2015, amidst substantial publicity.\n\nGemini seeks to differentiate itself by setting up under the supervision of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and it can accept deposits in traditional currencies as well as bitcoin. The company emphasizes security and regulatory compliance, as it seeks customers from among mainstream depositors.\n\nGemini has struggled to generate significant volume in its first few months. Critics see its policy of charging 25 basis points to both the buyer and seller as a major sticking point, as most exchanges charge less to the buyer. Exchanges have generally been cutting fees to increase liquidity, which remains a tiny fraction of the traditional foreign exchange market.\n\n5. Kraken\n\nThe Kraken exchange was founded by Jesse Powell. It is based in San Francisco and is the market leader in trade versus the euro. Kraken is considered a leader in security and was selected by the Japanese government\'s trustee to assist in the investigation and windup of the Mt. Gox exchange. Kraken is also one of two exchanges, along with Coinbase, that has been incorporated into the Bloomberg terminals, which are widely used by the financial industry.\n\nThe company has been quite vocal in its objections to New York\'s new BitLicense, which as of August 2015, is required for all exchanges that take deposits from residents of that state. It has stated it will forgo all New York business rather than comply.', '33 Signs that Bitcoin Growth Isn’t Slowing in 2016\n\nShare Share Reddit Email Shares 312\n\n33 Signs that Bitcoin Growth Isn’t Slowing in 2016\n\nIt’s been a year of mixed results for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and speculators.\n\nThe biggest positive for Bitcoin is that it was actually the best performing currency this year, ahead of the US Dollar and the Israeli Shekel. Bitcoins have climbed a solid 21% in value over the course of the year in USD terms, and even more relative to other currencies. While the cryptocurrency hasn’t reached the heights it did in 2013, this is still a sign of positive strength.\n\nOn the other hand, mainstream news around Bitcoin over the course of 2015 has been distracting at best.\n\nRoss Ulbricht, the man supposedly behind Silk Road, was sentenced to life imprisonment in May without the possibility of parole.\n\nMore recently, the Hunt for Satoshi has also heated up. Wired and Gizmodo subsequently both published reports that former Australian academic Craig Steven Wright was the creator of Bitcoin. Within hours, his house was raided by Australian police as part of an “unrelated” case. Days later, Wired rescinded its affirmation that Wright was the creator of the cryptocurrency, and instead asserted it was an elaborate hoax.\n\nLastly, despite close to $500 million in venture capital going into cryptocurrency-related pursuits, so far there hasn’t been any breakthroughs or apps that have captured the public’s eye. There has been progress and recognition around the merits of blockchain technology, but ultimately Bitcoin remains in the trough of disillusionment.\n\nBitcoin Growth in 2016\n\nToday’s infographic highlights 33 signs that growth in Bitcoin will not slow down in 2016.\n\nIn our opinion, here are the most important reasons:\n\nThe total amount of VC investment in Bitcoin since 2012 is $927 million. Over half of this investment has occurred in 2015 alone.\n\nWorld-class merchants now accept bitcoins for payment, including: Microsoft, Dell, Expedia, Dish, Overstock, TigerDirect, and Intuit.\n\nTransaction fees with bitcoins are extremely low: 0.0001 BTC per 1000 bytes.\n\nDaily transactions occurring with bitcoins amount to about $289 million per day. This is comparable to Paypal ($397 million), Square ($362 million), or Western Union ($216 million).\n\nOriginal graphic by: BargainFox\n\nEmbed This Image On Your Site (copy code below):\n\nCourtesy of: Visual Capitalist\n\nRelated', ""Companies and services using Bitcoin are poised to rise to the top of the US to Mexico remittance industry, Mexico's second largest industry. Many experts stated in an interview with CoinTelegraph that the market has huge potential to make cross-border money transfers simpler and cheaper which will save millions of dollars for Mexican people and the economy.\n\nThe remittance corridor between the USA and Mexico is currently the biggest and most competitive in the world attracting more and more remittance providers every year. Remittances sent to Mexico from the United States by emigrants totaled $20.69 billion in the first 10 months of 2015. Immigrants traditionally use transfer services like Western Union, which can cost almost 7% of the transfer amount. Utilizing Bitcoin instead can significantly cut down on transaction costs.\n\nSusanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, founder and CEO of Bitnation, sees promise in the future of Bitcoin remittance services:\n\n“I believe it will be the end of the remittance industry as we know it. Old companies like Western Union won't be competitive. Perhaps new ones will emerge like we've seen in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia, where they've [sic] themed up with mobile phone operators, so the remittance recipient can get cash in the local currency at local mobile shops or top-up stations.”\n\nProblems\n\nJosé Rodríguez, VP of Payments for Mexican Bitcoin exchange Bitso, sees potential in the Bitcoin remittance market, with the biggest obstacle to growth being education, information, and having user-friendly applications:\n\n“We have participated in events hosted by banks or financial institutions, and spoken with their teams and heads, and there is interest and will to learn more. Companies like [remote bill-paying service] Saldo do, and are very active on education and customer acquisition. On our side we are more on their backend but we have had some approaches with immigration associations.”\n\nAnother problem is that Mexico has very strict AML regulations and high penalties for non-compliance because of the drug trade. It can make startups’ work in the country more complicated. Nevertheless, it doesn’t stop remittance companies from conquering the market as it is, perhaps, the biggest one in the world. 35 million people living in the USA claim a full or partial Mexican ancestry, and another 7 million are unauthorized immigrants from Mexico.\n\nAnother problem may be caused by the US government as they realize the amount of money which flows out of the country’s economy due to the ease of such remittances. According to the American Real Estate mogul and presidential candidate Donald Trump, the country loses billions of dollars from illegal immigrants’ money transfers. That’s why he offers an immigration plan which involves the increase of fees. CoinTelegraph has covered this issue earlier. Trump stated:\n\n“Mexico continues to make billions on not only our bad trade deals but also relies heavily on the billions of dollars in Remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the United States back to Mexico (US$22 billion in 2013 alone) […] Mexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages.”\n\nGood News\n\nGood news for the growth potential of the Bitcoin remittance industry from the United States to Mexico: Hispanic Americans poll as the ethnic group most likely to have heard about Bitcoin.\n\nJosé Rodríguez sees more potential in using the traditional ATM banking network for withdrawal and working with banks on automation and integration than building up a bitcoin ATM network in Mexico, noting that “the mexican network of Bitcoin ATMs isn’t as big, around 10 in the whole country.”\n\nEric Grill, CEO of CoinOutlet, “would love to operate Bitcoin ATM's in Mexico,” noting that the Texas-Mexico corridor is the largest remittance corridor in the world:""]"
12/22/2015,"['LONDON (Reuters) - 2016 could prove to be the year that the price of bitcoin surges again. Not because of any dark-web drug-dealing or Russian ponzi scheme, but for an altogether less sensational reason - slower growth in the money supply.\n\nBitcoin (virtual currency) coins are seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris, France, May 27, 2015. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nBitcoin is a web-based “cryptocurrency” used to move money around quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority. But despite being championed by some as the digital money of the future, it is often dismissed as a currency that is too volatile to invest in.\n\nThe reason 2016 looks set to be different is that bitcoin’s price is likely to be driven in large part by similar factors to a traditional fiat currency, following the age-old principles of supply and demand.\n\nInstead of being controlled by a central bank, bitcoin relies on so-called ""mining"" computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. In return, the first to solve the puzzle and thereby clear the transactions is currently rewarded with 25 new bitcoins, worth around $11,000 BTC=BTSP.\n\nBut when it was invented in 2008 by the mysterious “Satoshi Nakamoto”, who has yet to be identified, the bitcoin program was designed so that the reward would be halved roughly every four years, in order to keep a lid on inflation. The next time that is due to happen is July 2016.\n\nBitcoin was also designed to emulate a commodity by having a finite supply of 21 million bitcoins, which will be reached in around 125 years, up from around 15 million today. Hence, also, the use of the term “mining”.\n\nDaniel Masters, co-founder of Jersey-based Global Advisors’ multi-million dollar bitcoin hedge fund, started his career as an oil trader at Shell in the mid-1980s and spent 30 years trading commodities before crossing over to bitcoin.\n\nNow he reckons the price of bitcoin could test its 2013 highs of above $1,100 next year and then pick up speed to rise to $4,400 by the end of 2017.\n\nThat would be due to a number of factors, Masters said, including an increased acceptance of payments in bitcoin by big companies and authorities, rapidly growing interest and investment in the “blockchain” technology that underpins bitcoin transactions, and also more demand from China as its currency weakens and the economy slows.\n\nBut taken in isolation, the halving of the mining reward will increase the price of bitcoin by around 50 percent from where it is now, Masters reckons. That is despite the fact that the halving of the reward has always been inevitable - a factor that would already have been accounted for in pretty much every other market.\n\n“If OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries)came out tomorrow and said, ‘in six months’ time we’re going to halve oil production’, the oil price would instantaneously react. But the bitcoin market is still in its infancy, and I don’t think that factor is discounted into the price fully,” he said.\n\nDECENTRALIZED DIGITAL ASSET\n\nBitcoin’s price has already almost doubled in the last three months, putting it on track for its best quarter in two years. It hit $500 last month for the first time since August last year, with Chinese demand for a pyramid scheme set up by a Russian fraudster cited as a reason for the price surge.\n\nBut Bobby Lee, the chief executive of one of the leading bitcoin exchanges in China, BTCC, reckons there is scope for the cryptocurrency to go much further. He thinks the price could increase by as much as eight times in the time up to the reward halving, taking it as high as $3,500 by next summer.\n\n“Today the worth of bitcoin is $1 per capita in the world (population),” Lee said, referring to the value of all the bitcoins in circulation, around $6.5 billion. “For such an innovative, decentralized digital asset, I say ‘boy, are we undervaluing it’. But it takes a while for people to realize that.”\n\nThe mining reward has already been halved once before, in November 2012, from 50 to 25 bitcoins. The stakes were much lower then, with one bitcoin worth around $12, but nevertheless the price increased by about 150 percent in the preceding seven months - roughly the time left before the next halving.\n\n“It (the halving) dampens supply so, all other things being equal, that puts upwards pressure on price,” said Jeremy Millar, partner at London-based financial technology specialists Magister Advisors, who expects demand to continue to increase.\n\n“No one can argue with that fundamental economic principle.”', 'Best known as the maligned twins in the Facebook origin story, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are hoping to gain attention for being involved in another possible Internet giant: Bitcoin. They adopted it early, back in 2012, when cryptocurrency was still a fringe concept. In October, they got approval from financial regulators to launch their own U.S.-based exchange: Gemini. Here’s why they have bet that Bitcoin will go big.\n\nTW: We are fascinated with Bitcoin because it is the first iteration of money that’s actually built for the Internet, by the same type of engineers who built the Internet itself.\n\nCW: It sends payments over protocols, the same way we send data and voice today.\n\nTW: With just a cellphone and a Bitcoin address, you now have a bank account. You have a way to accept payment. You have a way to store value that isn’t your mattress.\n\nCW: How it’ll affect your life in the U.S. might be substantially different than in another part of the world. If you’re in Argentina, and there’s currency debasement of 25 to 30 percent a year, Bitcoin is sort of like disaster insurance. Plus you don’t have to give over a lot of personal information to a retailer like you do with a credit card, so things like identity theft and consumer protection are actually improved.\n\nTW: Early Bitcoin operators, like Silk Road, definitely did it a disservice. But the irony is that Bitcoin is not good for illicit behavior. We know that because Silk Road was busted. And then two of the federal agents who made the bust and embezzled some of the Bitcoin were arrested too. The provenance of every coin—where it’s traveled, what marketplace it’s been on, what addresses have touched it—is all transparent and completely public.\n\nCW: So how’s it going to affect your day-to-day? Through transactions we can’t even contemplate right now.\n\nTW: Things like property deeds and title insurance could be moved to a blockchain-type transaction, such as Bitcoin. Computers and self-driving cars can’t go open up a bank account at JPMorgan or Wells Fargo, but they can plug into protocols. So if your power meter needs to purchase more energy, you can program it to do that with Bitcoin. The fact that the government is now regulating Bitcoin shows it understands that the currency is hugely transformative. This decentralized blockchain-type technology is here to stay. And it’s going to completely rewire the way the Internet works.\n\nThis article is part of the Future Of Money feature from our January/February 2016 issue.

Estimating the price of wildly fluctuating Bitcoin, which is much more than just some financial instrument, is nearing almost magic. One day it can shoot up by 10% just to see it fall 5% following day.

The biggest driver behind price increases will be increased global awareness of Bitcoin. Today, the price of Bitcoin is $1 per capita.

Investors will start to realise that the banks favourite buzzword - Blockchain, is far less interesting and valuable than the only Blockchain working at scale - Bitcoin. This should produce a new flow of investors as banks promote Blockchains, introducing new investors to this concept, but eventually investors will realise Bitcoin is more valuable as a global way to transfer value from A to B without needing a bank, bringing new buy pressure to the market and institutional volume. Looking at the all time chart, if the bull market takes us past $600 I see no reason why we should not see new highs breaking through the $1,200 level, but this time sustained support at the new high for several months at the end of 2016 with significantly higher volume.""\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO SearchTrade:\n\n“Next year post halving I expect 5x price rise, so we could see Bitcoin between $1,500 to $2,000 range by the end of 2016.

Elliott waves are not focused on time estimation, but if I have to share my opinion that five waves look very euphoric. I think it might hit 600 $ in less than 3 months. Then there will come a sharp correction and the price can fall down back to $350. 2016 will be the best year for Bitcoin.

As a technology it is good at these three things, and that’s what we should focus upon.\n\nFor banks, the permissioned and shared ledger structures enabled by bitcoin technology provide value exchange and smart contracts is what the whole financial system has woken up to, which is why we talk about blockchain more than bitcoin.\n\nPrivate ledgers enable banks to exchange value in a trusted shared network, and that network can be backed by USD, EUR or RMB, no bitcoin required.\n\nThe \'no bitcoin required\' systems are all based upon private shared structures, and the key to this is to remember that word shared.\n\nMoving fast\n\nNo blockchain development has value in the financial system unless it\'s shared by a critical mass of people.\n\nHence R3 is interesting, with Sberbank being the latest bank wanting to join the global consortium of 30 banks and financial institutions.

I was ready to shop for presents. But I couldn’t find anyone who would take my money.\n\nHeck, when I asked if I could pay with it, many looked at me as if I was from Mars!\n\nTo be fair, I wasn’t offering to pay in dollars. I wasn’t trying to use my credit card or even Apple Pay. Instead, I was trying to spend some bitcoin.\n\nNow, I know. The computer-based currency still seems a little new, even though it’s been around for six years. And it works differently than cash or credit cards. You typically store coins in a smartphone app or Web service, not in a physical wallet, for example. And to make a payment, you typically scan a QR-code, the square bar codes, rather than handing over bills or swiping a card.\n\nBut I was at Westfield Valley Fair mall, in the heart of Silicon Valley, the most high-tech area in the world, where not only can you walk a few steps to go from an Apple store to a Microsoft outlet and buy drones from multiple vendors, but you can find one of the few bitcoin ATMs in the Bay Area. Surely some store there would sell me something for bitcoin.\n\nNope. I couldn’t find a one.\n\nInstead, the typical reaction was one of confusion. It’s easy to see why merchants might be perplexed by a currency that is not printed, produced or backed by governments and whose value is derived not from the backing of a nation, central bank or its convertibility into a precious metal like gold, but from the trust that owners have in it.\n\n“I’ve never heard of that,” a clerk in a children’s clothing store told me.\n\n“We don’t even know what that is,” said a clerk in a shoe store.\n\n“We don’t even take the chip card yet,” said a clerk from a second children’s clothing outlet.\n\nI was stunned. Hadn’t they heard about the revolution? Why hadn’t they gotten on board?\n\nAdmittedly, I was a late convert. I’d been hearing about bitcoin for a while now, but I’d never been terribly interested in trying it out. It just seemed too esoteric and too risky.\n\nBut I got religion at a conference I attended earlier this month on the future of money. It was hard not to — everywhere I turned, there were evangelists of the computer currency.\n\nTo hear them tell it, bitcoin today is at the same stage as the Internet was 20 years ago — not only is it about to go mainstream, but it’s on the cusp of transforming wide swaths of the economy. According to the bitcoin believers, the crypto-currency is going to change the way we exchange money, and its underlying technology — something called the blockchain, which makes a permanent, inalterable record of transactions — is going to fundamentally alter the way we do everything from pay taxes to purchase homes.\n\nAfter hearing this enthusiastic talk, downloading a wallet app to my phone and getting my first collection of cypto-coins — a whopping $2 worth — from a fellow attendee, I was on the bitcoin bus.\n\nOf course, $2 won’t buy you much, whether it’s in bitcoin or baht or bucks, which is why I headed to Valley Fair. I figured I could buy some more at the ATM, maybe meet up with some other bitcoin zealots, and then go shopping.\n\nThat mission was something of a bust. For one thing, the ATM was hard to find, tucked into an out-of-the-way corner on a side hallway on the second floor. If you didn’t know it was there — or didn’t use the elevator right next to it — you’d probably never notice it.\n\nFor another, few people paid it much attention. A clerk at the T-Mobile store across the hall assured me that he saw people go to the bitcoin ATM every day. But after hanging out near it for close to an hour over the course of two days, I didn’t see anybody use it. The smattering of people who approached it mostly seemed to just be passing the time while waiting for the elevator.\n\nAfter checking out the ATM myself, I understand why it’s not more popular, even among bitcoin afficionados. The exchange rates were extortionary! I would have had to pay more than $416 per bitcoin, which at that point was $50 more than the going rate in the online marketplace.\n\nNot willing to pay that kind of premium, I considered purchasing some cybercurrency through an online marketplace. But to buy bitcoins from the marketplace app I downloaded, I’d need to link my bank account to it, and remove the extra security protection I have in place when logging into that account. As excited as I was about bitcoin, that made me a bit queasy.\n\nSo before I took that step, I wanted to see what my bitcoin could buy. So I started wandering the mall.\n\nBefore my fellow bitcoin backers start slamming me, I know that mainstream online merchants like Dell and Overstock.com take bitcoin. And at vendors like Gyft, you can buy dollar-denominated gift cards with bitcoin that you can use at a local retailer.\n\nBut I couldn’t figure out why I’d want to spend dollars to buy bitcoin to then buy a gift card valued in dollars — and pay exchange fees in the process — when I could just use a credit card or, heck, old-school cash. And I was determined to see how this virtual monetary revolution was functioning in the real world.\n\nWell, let’s just say I had a much easier time finding an Internet cafe in Paris in 1996 than I did finding a vendor who accepted bitcoin at Valley Fair mall during the holidays in 2015. I had a hard time finding anyone who knew what bitcoin was or had even heard of it.\n\nIf there was anyone in the mall who was going to accept bitcoin, it was going to be Mykola Mykhailian, who owns a T-shirt shop named Custom Teez that operates a kiosk in the middle of the mall. Mykhailian is 28. He’s an entrepreneur. And he’s a bitcoin backer.\n\nMykhailian owns some 80 bitcoins, worth about $35,000, which he keeps mostly as an investment. But he’s used the currency to buy spa treatments in Las Vegas for himself and his girlfriend. So he knows it has real-world value.\n\nBut not even Mykhailan, a bitcoin proponent, accepts it. He said he thought about taking the currency a few months ago, but decided against it because it was just too volatile. Just this year, the currency’s valuation has fluctuated from around $330 per bitcoin down to about $177 and then back up to more than $460 now.\n\n“It’s probably not a good time to accept it,” Mykhailian said. “I’m going to wait it out.”\n\nI think that means I’m going to have to wait, too. Bitcoin may end up being as revolutionary as backers believe. But even in Silicon Valley, the evidence for that can be hard to find.\n\nContact Troy Wolverton at 408-840-4285 or twolverton@mercurynews.com.

But what happens when money has a public record of every transaction, and morally questionable trades can be identified? Is bitcoin headed for a break in fungibility?\n\nThe debate about whether Bitcoin is fit to be a currency rather than a payment layer between currencies is as alive as it has ever been. Many of these tensions about what Bitcoin is or should be have been aired and discussed during the blocksize debate and are ongoing.\n\nOne essential element of a money which has not particularly been illustrated is how bitcoin might be affected by a significant gap in its “fungibility.”\n\n“[Fungibility] is the idea that a 10 dollar note is the same as any other 10 dollar note. So if you receive a note that was involved in a theft 10 transactions go and the police investigated the theft, then they would have no right to take the note away from you,” according to Adam Back, the inventor of Hashcash.\n\nAccording to Back, this is an old legal concept, often traced to a 17th century court case in Scotland. In that case, a pair of high value notes marked with a unique signature were stolen and later on turned up at a bank. The owner took the case to court in an attempt to have the bank return the notes to him. The courts ruled that “if notes could be returned to a previous owner after a theft, it could erode confidence in a currency,” since your ownership would be at question and you would have to go and check the newspapers or try to make sure your money has not been claimed as stolen.\n\nWhile the above briefly illuminates the history of fungibility as a key characteristic to money, it still leaves questions about what might actually happen to a currency if such a crack in fungibility appeared. Kristov Atlas, a bitcoin privacy researcher raised some questions about the importance of fungibility in a recent post saying:\n\nThe needs for fungibility are somewhat unclear, in my opinion. Privacy advocates have been talking up fungibility for a while without providing a lot of evidence to back it. Perhaps this is why it has made such a dull impression on people.\n\nFungibility is a particular concern for bitcoin because bitcoin, unlike cash, sea shells or silver coins, has a cryptographically provable history of ownership. If the identity of a particular bitcoin’s previous owners or the nature of the transactions they engaged in was to be revealed and deemed illegal, could this cause a future where new or unspent ‘virgin’ bitcoins are worth much more than old bitcoins orwhere coins associated with Silk Road transactions lose a great deal of their value?\n\nSuch a scenario is not far-fetched. There are various blockchain analytics and compliance companies such as Coinalytics and Chainanalysis which claim to be using artificial intelligence algorithms to group addresses and transactions and thus reveal ‘entities’ in the network. It’s not hard to imagine that someday bitcoin payment processors could automatically compare incoming bitcoins to a “dirty coin” database, to determine their legality and or past connection with illegal trade.\n\nTo learn more about these questions and concerns, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with J.P. Koning, an economics blogger with a substantial body of work on the history of money.\n\nBM: Do you know any examples in history where the fungibility of a currency broke? How did that play out?\n\nKoning: Many of the problems faced by those who managed medieval monetary system can be traced to deficits in fungibility.\n\nFor instance, England\'s silver pennies degraded steadily over time through regular wear and tear and also as they were clipp\'d and sweated. When the mint issued new full bodied pennies, questions of fungibility emerged. A new penny, after all, had much more silver than a worn penny, and therefore had more intrinsic value. But each were pennies; they both had the same face value. So just as you get good and bad bitcoin, you had good and bad pennies.\n\nThe medieval economy dealt with the fungibility problem in a unique way. According to law and custom, merchants accepted all coins at face value. Put differently, they did not differentiate between old and new pennies. Shoppers thus had an incentive to pay with old and degraded pennies rather than use new full-bodied pennies. Why buy a fish with 24 grams of silver when you can pay with just 23 grams? Thus the bad money drove out the good from circulation; this is Gresham\'s famous law. For centuries, only the worst pennies circulated in England.\n\nIn the case of bitcoin, I\'m not sure that law or custom would require merchants to accept all bitcoin at the same rate. If they were to differentiate between the two, you\'d most likely get the opposite effect; good money would drive out the bad.”\n\nBM: Are you worried about a scenario where bitcoins with close association with a bitcoin address used on the Silk Road are flagged as being high risk for money laundering? What is the worse that could happen to bitcoin in the above scenario?\n\nKoning: That reminds me of the recent euro crisis, where various types of euros threatened to become non-fungible with others. This summer, for instance, Greek euro deposits certainly lost their equivalence to non-Greek euros.\n\nKoning expanded on this thought in a related article, where he wrote:\n\nOne of the deep problems facing the euro over the last three years was fear of euro break up. If Greece decided to leave the euro (or was kicked out), a Greek euro would no longer be equal to a German one. In the mind of the markets, euros had ceased to be homogeneous.\n\nIn anticipation of potential break up, a tremendous bank run began in which massive amounts of Italian, Greek, Irish, Spanish, and Portuguese euro deposits were converted into German and Dutch euro deposits. This all occurred on the books of the ECB\'s intra-eurosystem clearing mechanism—Target2. While no limits had ever been placed on Target2 balances (or imbalances), fears that Germans might revolt and try to close the Target2 window led to ever faster withdrawals from the GIIPS.\n\nBM: Bitcoin in some ways is very different than cash, particularly because the identification of each coin is tied to a historical public record of every transaction. I wonder if you know of any examples where such a financial asset suffered from a gap in fungibility. Like the stock of a company, or any other ownership token that would have a transparent history of ownership.\n\nKoning: Bills of exchange and chopmarked coins also had a paper trail. In the case of bills of exchange, the moment that the credit worthiness of a certain cosignatory to a bill of exchange was doubted, it would have started to trade at a much larger discount to par.\n\nAnalog versus Digital Money\n\nKoning’s historical insights do paint a picture into how the market might evolve as money’s fungibility changes, but bitcoin is unique and may evolve differently than any money before it.\n\nMany of Koning’s examples were related to a break in fungibility for political reasons, such as the euro crisis which saw runs on banks and demand for more trusted government versions of the euro versus the euros in Greek banks. However, Bitcoin’s fungibility might be threatened by its use in dark markets.\n\nIt is no secret that bitcoin has been widely used online to purchase goods on dark markets such as the Silk Road. A report by Kyle Soska and Nicolas Christin from Carnegie Mellon University claims that dark markets had a higher daily bitcoin trade volume than BitPay’s reported $435,000 daily average, in 2014.\n\n""In the short four years since the development of the original Silk Road, total volumes have reached up to $650,000 daily (averaged over 30-day windows) and are generally stable around $300,000–$500,000 a day, far exceeding what had been previously reported,"" said the report.\n\nVirgin Coins and Bitcoin’s Fungibility\n\nTo learn about the demand for newly mined, unspent “virgin” Bitcoins, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with FinTech consultant Bilal Dar. According to Dar, he’s seen “virgin” bitcoin trading at a 20 percent to 30 percent premium to market prices.\n\nThe demand for virgin was nothing new ... Having virgin coins had many benefits. A full block of 25 coins mined between 2012 to 2016 would have collectible value. Similar is the value for 50 BTC block ... there are ways of deferring taxes if you have a coin with no or least amount of history. [Though some of this] would require private key swapping and a \'substantial\' amount of trust between parties conducting transaction.\n\nSo did the value of Virgin coins have anything to do with the possibility of older coins being \'dirty\'? No ... It was more of a possibility of \'perceived value\' ... People had a lack of understanding, and in some case genuine use cases.\n\nToday he claims that the demand for virgin coins remains, but the supply has increased dramatically. “You can wait for 2 weeks and batches of freshly minted coin from China would be available,” said Dar.\n\nThe Foreseeable Future\n\nThe impact of a privacy leak or fungibility weakness in Bitcoin is yet to be discovered. After all, a cryptographically provable history of every transaction is an essential part Bitcoin and the blockchain. The good news is that this topic is in the mind of many Bitcoin core developers and pioneers such as Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell and many others.\n\nIn a 2014 presentation, Back explained the functionality of something called Blind RSA transactions dating back to the days of digicash, which according to him, are “cryptographically unlinkable"" and ""payer anonymous.” Another promising discussion may be something called Confidential Transactions, being developed by several core developers at Blockstream.\n\nAnd of course, many alternative cryptocurrencies have worked on the issue for years, including DASH, Monero, Cryptonote, and Zerocash. How Bitcoin will adapt to this market environment and whether it will evolve beyond this threat to its fungibility remains to be seen.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

But in addition to these initiatives, some big technology companies are exploring Ripple, Factom and Ethereum protocols, according to Finance Magnates.\n\nMicrosoft’s Azure cloud service recently acquired Ethereum capabilities, followed by Factom, Ripple and others.\n\nFactom Price Spikes And Holds\n\nAzure’s embrace of Factom recently gave a big boost to its cryptocurrency, which crypto exchanges added for trade in October. Factom, an Austin, Texas-based data management software provider, jumped by more than 600% to nearly 0.002 BTC ($0.90) and these gains have largely held.\n\nMore than $1 million worth of Factom’s currency was traded in a recent 24-hour period, marking the third highest after bitcoin and litecoin. Factom’s $5.5 million market cap now ranks at number 12.\n\nSomething similar happened 14 months ago when Overstock’s “cryptosecurity” project tried the Counterparty platform, which boosted its XCP currency before it declined when its participation in the project ended\n\nMicrosoft partnered with ConsenSys, an Ethereum-based startup to provide blockchain as an enterprise solution for Azure, CCN recently reported. Brooklyn, N.Y.-based ConsenSys is an Ethereum coder collective that allows Azure enterprise users to gain access to Ethereum’s Blockchain-as-a-Service.\n\nWill the Factom rally last? Two years ago, such jumps were nothing special. But today, these spikes could have a new significance in serving as a reminder for where the blockchain is going.\n\nFactom raised $1.4 million from 10 investors as part of a planned $5 million seed financing last week, according to an SEC filing, reported The Austin Business Journal.\n\nAlso read: Microsoft adds Factom & CoinPrism as partners to its blockchain platform\n\nAzure Utilizes Private Blockchains\n\nAzure clients will also be able to use BlockApps, a private blockchain sandbox where developers can experiment with an application before releasing it to the Ethereum blockchain or elsewhere.\n\nEther.Camp, another blockchain explorer tool, will allow Azure clients to develop blockchain-based apps, possibly at a lower cost than those required elsewhere. Apps include cross-border payments, securities trading, corporate accounting with more transparency, self-executing smart contracts and more.\n\nMicrosoft, with a market capitalization of $430 billion, remains the largest company to offer bitcoin as a payment to consumers.\n\nChart from CoinMarketCap and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"

In addition, increased demand from China is also expected as the nation’s currency weakens and the economy slows.\n\nIn the last three months, the price of Bitcoin has almost doubled, putting it on track for its best quarter in two years. In November, the price of Bitcoin hit $500 for the first time since August in 2014, due to the Chinese demand for a pyramid scheme set up by a Russian fraudster.\n\n""Today the worth of bitcoin is $1 per capita in the world (population),"" Bobby Lee, the chief executive of one of the leading bitcoin exchanges in China, BTCC, said, referring to the value of all the bitcoins in circulation, around $6.5 billion.\n\n""For such an innovative, decentralised digital asset, I say \'boy, are we undervaluing it\'.

Earlier seasons of the series had their fair share of drama, like in season six when the gigantic Mt. Gox exchange imploded, taking millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin with it, but even that doesn\'t compare to the show\'s recent ""wacky"" phase, where it seems like anything goes.\n\nWithout a doubt, 2015 was the craziest year yet for Bitcoin, the virtual currency that, in the last six years, has gone from a niche hobby for people who\'ve read Neuromancer to being on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek.\n\nThis year, the stakes got higher, the hunt for Bitcoin\'s anonymous creator intensified, and the resulting drama threatened to tear the cryptocurrency community apart. Welcome to the big show, folks.\n\nGIF via Giphy\n\nCRYPTO-DRUG DEALERS GOT THEIR ROBESPIERRE\n\nIn 2015, libertarian keyboard warriors and Russell Brand alike got their very own Robespierre: Ross Ulbricht, a 31-year-old college-educated libertarian who was sentenced to life in prison for operating the Silk Road dark web market under the pseudonym ""Dread Pirate Roberts.""\n\nFor a while, Silk Road was the go-to location on the dark web for buyers and sellers of drugs, with Bitcoin as their currency of choice. After Ulbricht\'s 2013 arrest and 2015 sentencing, his supporters, united under the banner ""Free Ross,"" were up in arms over what they saw as a harsh sentence, and dealers picked up the slack by starting new markets to fill the void left by Silk Road.\n\nBut the saga didn\'t end there. That would be far too neat and tidy for Bitcoin. There were also two corrupt DEA agents, who were both recently sentenced to prison for doing everything from stealing bitcoins to setting someone up for a hit. And yes, there could still be more crooked cops on the Silk Road case.\n\nUlbricht wasn\'t alone in running Silk Road, either. This was also the year the feds tracked down ""Variety Jones"", Ulbricht\'s right hand man, also known as Roger Clarke. They\'ve since charged him with numerous offences, including narcotics trafficking, and Motherboard\'s own Joseph Cox kept tabs on the whole thing all the while.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHERE WAS BASICALLY A CIVIL WAR OVER A CODE CHANGE\n\nIt all started in December of 2014, when longtime Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen proposed a change to Bitcoin\'s code. The change was intended to help the network handle its anticipated growth by, essentially, increasing the size of the ""blocks"" of data that get uploaded to the blockchain, the publicly viewable ledger at the heart of Bitcoin.\n\n""That makes sense,"" you might say—except the proposed change turned into a total shit show and everyone got mad and said mean things about each other for much of 2015. Even core developers started picking sides. Prominent developer Mike Hearn aligned with Andresen, while others, such as core developerPeter Todd, took a decidedly more contrarian position.\n\nNow, nearly a year later, pretty much everyone agrees that something needs to be done to prepare BItcoin for a huge influx of users, if they ever come, but not everyone thinks Andresen\'s idea is the solution. So, that\'s something.\n\nWatch more from Motherboard: Life Inside a Chinese Bitcoin Mine\n\n\n\nPEOPLE KEPT TRYING TO BREAK BITCOIN\n\nIn a war of words, sometimes the best weapon is a little bit of action. Amidst all the hysteria about the network not being able to handle the load of more users, something strange started happening. In June, a Bitcoin exchange called Coinwallet.eu began spamming the Bitcoin network with so many junk transactions that the system slowed to a crawl.\n\nCoinwallet.eu referred to these tests as ""stress tests,"" but others preferred ""spam attack."" Coinwallet.eu, which apparently was willing to piss away the thousands of dollars in Bitcoin, did this several times in 2015 to prove a point: Bitcoin\'s code needs to be updated to handle more traffic.\n\nOther mysterious parties began spamming the Bitcoin network in 2015, as well. During one July attack by unknown parties, cleaning up the mess required creating the largest Bitcoin transaction of all time.\n\nOne spammer, who claimed to be Russian and went by the name ""Alister Maclin,"" also claimed responsibility for one of the more damaging spam attacks in October. Why? In an interview with Motherboard, the spammer told me he really just doesn\'t think Bitcoin is a very good idea at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nTOO MANY SATOSHIS\n\nThe first lesson in Bitcoin 101 is that nobody knows who actually wrote the original Bitcoin white paper that was circulated among cryptographers in 2008. The anonymous author goes by the pseudonym ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" and lots of people have tried to find out who he, she, or they, are, with very little success.\n\nLast year saw Newsweek point the finger at some random guy named Dorian Nakamoto. Although nobody can be totally sure, Dorian denied any involvement, and it almost certainly wasn\'t him. This year, two new high-profile entrants made it into the ever-growing pantheon of people who are probably not Satoshi Nakamoto: a cryptocurrency engineer named Nick Szabo and an Australian entrepreneur named craig Steven Wright.\n\nThe New York Times implicated Szabo in May for the following reasons: he engineered a predecessor to Bitcoin called ""bit gold,"" and he denies being Satoshi Nakamoto—which is just what the real Satoshi Nakamoto would do. As for Wright, Wired and Gizmodo ran parallel investigations that named him as the likely person behind Nakamoto based on evidence provided to them by someone claiming to be a hacker. Very little of this evidence was verified and some of it was likely faked, as Motherboard reported.\n\n\n\nNice try everyone, better luck next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBUREAUCRACY MET CRYPTOCURRENCY\n\nMuch to the chagrin of Bitcoin\'s largely libertarian-leaning community, some governments began taking steps to regulate Bitcoin. In New York State, much-maligned BitLicense legislation began forcing Bitcoin businesses to get a license to operate in September of 2015. The law was summarily suplexed by the head of MIT\'s Digital Currency Initiative, Brian Forde, along with other prominent members of the community.\n\nOutside of the US, the province of Quebec in Canada followed suit with a similar law, although a report by the Canadian Senate recommended that the government take a very hands-off approach to Bitcoin—at least for now. Europe has also announced plans to regulate Bitcoin amid fears that ISIS is using it to fund their operations, despite a near-total lack of evidence that they actually are.\n\nLOTS OF PEOPLE GOT IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW\n\nRoss Ulbricht wasn\'t the only character in Bitcoin to run afoul of the law this year. And while the others perhaps don\'t have Ulbricht\'s star power or roguish good looks, they\'re worthy of their own mention on this list.\n\nFirst, there\'s Mark Karpeles, the Bitcoin entrepreneur who ran the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox\'s fall is one of the more infamous episodes in Bitcoin\'s history. When it unexpectedly folded in early 2014, due to a devastating hack, according to Karpeles, it took $473 million worth of Bitcoin with it. Karpeles was arrested by Japanese police several times in 2015, until he was finally charged with embezzling $2.6 million from the failed exchange.\n\nNext, we have Josh Garza, the founder of much-derided and federally investigated mining hardware company GAW Miners. After a few of his other shady Bitcoin operating imploded in 2015, he was formally charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission for running a multi-million dollar ponzi scheme. It wasn\'t shocking in the least to anyone who was paying attention, and allowed me to make the joke ""Pyramids of Garza.""\n\nFinally, there\'s Shiny Flakes, a pseudonymous 20-year-old nerd from Germany who ended up running one of the dark web\'s most successful Bitcoin-for-drugs operations. In March, police in Leipzig raided his bedroom and arrested him, taking 4.1 million euros worth in cocaine, LSD, ketamine, weed, and more, with them. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. Besides Ulbricht himself, Shiny Flakes was probably the highest-profile Bitcoin-related sentencing of 2015, at least when it comes to slinging drugs over the Tor network.\n\n***\n\nAnd this concludes your recap of Bitcoin, season seven. It was a wild ride, and some of it didn\'t even make any sense. But that\'s okay, because season eight, coming in 2016, promises to be even better.', ""Funny how time flies when you’re having fun. Last year, the mainstream spent the year attacking Bitcoin for losing over 50% of it’s U.S. Dollar value, starting out over $800, and ending at just over $300. Yet, 2015 has not only shown Bitcoin’s resiliency in market value, but the underlying Blockchain technology has been the talk of the economic world. Bitcoin’s Blockchain is attracting Fortune 500 corporations from around the world for use in future business. J.P. Morgan is the latest to “Aggressively invest” in Bitcoin’s technology.\n\nInternal memos were obtained by Business Insider, explaining how J.P. Morgan will spend 2016 focusing on the integration of Bitcoin’s Blockchain technology, amongst other cutting-edge technologies like robotics and “big data”. Daniel Pinto is the head of J.P. Morgan’s Corporate and Investment Bank.\n\n“As we look ahead to 2016, one of our major priorities will be to aggressively pursue the innovative technologies that we have been making investments in. Internal working groups have made significant advances this year and will be provided even more freedom to develop market-leading platforms in 2016. We have also established teams dedicated to areas such as blockchain technology, big data applications and robotics.”\n\nDemand for more efficient ledgers that don’t require the added time, expense, and the exposure the current counterpart system adds is rabid. Banks, in particular, are behind the curve when it comes to moving information efficiently, relying heavily on 20th-century tech to make transfers. The innovations being used for the past seven years by Bitcoin has finally enlightened the legacy banking industry on what can be done when you innovate. In an industry so heavily regulated as banking, innovation is curbed dramatically, but being an incumbent that helps create self-protecting regulations does that even better.\n\nBitcoin as a digital currency clearly doesn’t serve a banking industry built around the concept of exploiting the fractional reserve banking system. Jamie Dimon made news in the fall with his aggressive posture towards the digital currency, deciding that it will be deemed an illegal currency by the U.S. Government at some point in the future.\n\n“You’re wasting your time,” Dimon said when asked directly about Bitcoin at a Fortune Magazine Forum in October. “When the Department of Justice calls up and says ‘That’s an illegal currency, and it’s against the laws of the United States of America, and if you do it again, we’ll put you in jail, it’s over. This is my personal opinion. There will be no real non-controlled currency in the world. There’s no government that will put up with it for long. It's kind of cute now, but there will be no currency that gets around government controls. The (Blockchain) technology will be used, even to transfer currency, but it will be dollars.”\n\nNotice how Dimon used the term “currency” not money. He cannot call dollars “money” because, by definition, money is a store of value. U.S. Dollars, or any fiat currency, lose several percent per annum due to inflation, and have lost 97% of their actual value over the last century, so fiat currency doesn’t not qualify as money.\n\nHow banks currently move funds is through batch transactions at the end of the business day, kind of like a block entering the blockchain, only moving much slower, in daily increments, not every ten minutes or so. Plus, a third party has to move these funds, and a verification process has to be run when the sending institution moves funds to the intermediary and the intermediary transfers to the ending bank. At some point, banks look to have a wallet that can receive funds more directly, without the 3rd-party, or without waiting for a batch of transactions.\n\nR3 made news earlier in September by negotiating a partnership with many major banks, in lauding J.P. Morgan, to work with them on Blockchain integration into their mainstream operations. Last week, R3 announced that they have signed more than forty banks overall this year, with many new partners joining the fold.\n\nBMO Financial Group, Danske Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Natixis, Nomura, Northern Trust, OP Financial Group, Banco Santander, Scotiabank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, U.S. Bancorp and Westpac Banking Corporation have all joined the banking partnership. They join industry leaders, like J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Citibank and Wells Fargo, among others."", ""If one proposal excited attendees at the recent Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong, Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Dr. Pieter Wuille's Segregated Witness was it. Praised by many within the technical community, Segregated Witness is expected to improve Bitcoin's performance in a number of ways, while some even hope it might be the scaling solution that helps bring some peace back to the Bitcoin community.\n\nThe first part of our three-part Segregated Witness series covered how it works. In this second part: What it does.\n\nIncreasing the Effective Block Size Without Increasing the Block-size Limit\n\nThe benefit of Wuille's Segregated Witness proposal that has perhaps drawn most attention, is that the removal of signatures from 1 megabyte blocks could effectively increase Bitcoin’s block size. This means more transactions per second can be recorded on the blockchain, or in other words, it would allow for a higher transaction throughput. It could do so, moreover, without breaking any of the existing consensus rules - including the block size limit.\n\nWuille's proposal does introduce a new type of maximum block size. The formula used to calculate this limit is set somewhat arbitrarily: A block without the Segregated Witnesses, plus a quarter of the Segregated Witnesses, must not exceed 1 megabyte. As such, all blocks will seem smaller than 1 megabyte to old nodes, since a quarter of the Segregated Witness (which they don't see) needs to fit in that same 1 megabyte. New nodes will meanwhile see blocks that exceed 1 megabyte, since the actual size of the Segregated Witness is larger than the quarter accounted for.\n\nThe exact amount of additional space Segregated Witness opens up depends on the types of transactions new blocks include. If more transactions store more data in the Segregated Witness, as multisig transactions would do, the total size of new blocks increases. This adds up to a new maximum block size of about 1.75 megabyte for normal transactions, and 4 megabyte as a hard cap that’s impossible to exceed even if (almost) all data is squized into the Segregated Witness.\n\nSay Goodbye to Transaction Malleability\n\nBut there's another, perhaps even greater advantage: Segregated Witness could take care of Bitcoin's transaction malleability. In fact, this was the original motivation for Wuille and others to explore the Segregated Witness concept.\n\nTransaction malleability is caused by a cryptographic trick to change a signature, without changing what that signature stands for. This can be done, moreover, without the private key used to create the original signature. In Bitcoin's case, this means that anyone can pick any transaction from the peer-to-peer network, and alter the signature into an equally valid signature. This new signature still reflects the exact same data it originally signed, and it can still be verified using the same public key. It doesn't change what a transaction does at all. But because it looks different, it does completely change the transaction ID.\n\nTransaction malleability causes two main problems. First, it messes up the accounting of Bitcoin software that uses transaction IDs to verify whether transactions are confirmed. But perhaps more importantly, transaction malleability severely limits the potential of all sorts of advanced Bitcoin tricks that build on unconfirmed transactions (using their IDs), such as payments channels and the Lightning Network.\n\nOf course, Segregated Witness pulls signatures out of the part of the transaction used to create the transaction ID. So while the signatures in the Segregated Witness could still be changed, this would not affect Bitcoin software using transaction IDs, nor would it matter for payments channels or the Lightning Network, thus setting the stage for the roll-out of additional scaling layers.\n\nScript Versions, or How Bitcoin Can Learn to do Almost Anything\n\nA third advantage of Wuille's Segregated Witness proposal has Bitcoin programmers just as excited as the first two – if not more-so: script versions.\n\nAs explained in the previous article, Segregated Witnesses carry scriptSigs that unlock bitcoin. But they carry something else, too: version bytes. These version bytes preface scriptSigs in Segregated Witnesses, indicating what kind of scriptSig it is. If a node reading the version byte recognizes the type, it can tell what requirements must be met to unlock bitcoin in the scriptSig. If a node reading the version byte does not recognize the type, it interprets the scriptSig as an “Anyone can spend.”\n\nThis opens up all sorts of new ways to lock bitcoin up in transactions. In fact, it can be used to lock bitcoin up in any way developers come up with. As such, it's impossible to explain how this will be used in the future, since much of this still needs to be invented. But initial ideas include Schnorr signatures, which are much faster to verify than signatures currently in use, and more complicated types of multisig transactions; perhaps even Ethereum-like scripts.\n\nAnd importantly: Like Segregated Witness itself, these types of upgrades will not break Bitcoin's existing consensus rules. Rather than every single Bitcoin node, only a majority of miners needs to adapt, making them much easier to deploy.\n\nFraud proofs: the Completion of Satoshi's Vision for SPV\n\nWe're not done yet. Segregated Witness could also introduce something called fraud proofs. Originally envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto, fraud proofs could significantly improve the security of SPV-nodes (or: “light wallets”); Bitcoin nodes that do not verify all transactions on the network or store the complete blockchain.\n\nTo check whether a transaction has taken place, SPV-nodes merely scan the blockchain for the relevant transaction ID. If they find it, that means a miner included the transaction in a block. But SPV-nodes do not validate whether the transaction adhered to Bitcoin’s consensus rules. As such, SPV-nodes trust miners to play fair, rather than verify they do. In a worst case scenario, this could even mean that miners pay SPV-nodes with bitcoin created out of nothing, for instance by creating transactions with no inputs, or by awarding themselves excess fees in the coinbase transaction.\n\nThese types of problems could be solved by requiring miners to include extra data in the Segregated Witness Merkle Tree, specifying where the bitcoin locked up in all transactions came from, exactly. That way, if a block contains invalid transactions, a short and easy-to-check fraud proof can be constructed by any full node. This full node can send the fraud proof to SPV-nodes, so they know to reject the block.\n\nThat said, even with fraud proofs, SPV-nodes would not quite offer the same level of security as full nodes. Most importantly, the fraud proof solution requires that SPV-nodes can communicate with the network free from censorship. (For instance: censorship from government-sanctioned ISPs.) Additionally, SPV-nodes need at least one full node on the network to actually produce the fraud proofs.\n\nStorage\n\nFinally, Segregated Witness could decrease the amount of data Bitcoin nodes need to store on their hard drives. This, again, reduces the burden of running a full node, and brings down the time it takes to sync a node with the network when first installed.\n\nWhile full nodes typically store all transaction data for all of Bitcoin's history, signatures are reasonably considered expendable after a certain amount of time has passed. Once a transaction is considered valid, confirmed into a block, and secured in the blockchain with proof of work for – say – a year, it could only have been fraudulent if miners were collectively mining on an invalid chain for all that time, and presumably without anyone noticing.\n\nOf course, ridding the blockchain of older signatures is not a purist's ideal, as he might want to verify old transaction data regardless. Fortunately, that's not likely to become a problem either. All it requires is one such purist to seed the Segregated Witness data for everyone else to download.\n\nThe third part of this three-part story will explore exactly what Segregated Witness means for the long-lasting block-size dispute. Thanks go out to Blockstream developers Pieter Wuille and Mark Friedenbach and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo for provided information and added feedback – not to mention a lot of patience."", 'David GW Birch is Director of Consult Hyperion, the secure electronic transactions consultancy. He is an internationally-recognised thought leader in digital identity and digital money and was named by Wired magazine as one of their global top 15 favourite sources of business information.\n\nFrom the perspective of the payments world, I think 2016 will see the trajectory of the blockchain shift and diverge.\n\nTo see why, let’s divide the payments roadmap into four areas and look at each of them individually to see how they interact with blockchain technology. These key areas are the technical, business, social and regulatory regions of the roadmap.\n\nTechnology Trends\n\nThere is no need to spend much time on the technology part of the road map because we can already see the important paths opening up: mobile everything, APIs for financial services and the blockchain will all develop throughout the year (irrespective of the specific evolution of bitcoin).\n\nI don’t think I’m sticking my neck out to say that, along with Big Data and cybersecurity, they will all attract more investment from the mainstream financial institutions (and yes, blockchain will be attracting more investment from such institutions).\n\nIn our transaction-oriented corner of the world, we are rather into the ECB strong consumer authentication (SCA) drive and obviously that’s started to verge into biometrics.\n\nApple made the breakthrough of reframing biometrics in the mass market as a convenience technology rather than security technology. That’s been tremendously successful and it’s going to continue, so I expect we will see a jump in the use mass market consumer biometrics in the payments world.\n\nBusiness Blockchains\n\nWhen it comes to the business area, I think we can see the outlines of some of the key trends.\n\nIf you look at the breakdown of European bank income, you see pressure in all parts of the business. As a result, there is a premium on coming up with some new business models and sources of income, which is where blockchain is more likely to come into play.\n\nI have a theory as to which one part of this might be, but let’s come back to that later.\n\nPayments is not all about banks. I think it’s interesting to look at the non-banks and near-banks as well – especially the near-banks.\n\nNear-banks are things that look like banks to consumers but aren\'t actually banks, taking specific niches in the marketplace. You’ve got Holvi and Moven and people like that in that space.\n\nThen you have the non-banks such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and so on.\n\nI think one underexamined group out there is retailers. Retailers haven’t really moved in that space yet (apart from the obvious example of Starbucks), and because retailers dominate the contacts with the customer, which ones choose to do in that space might turn out to be more significant.\n\nThe continuing shift toward in-app retailer solution adumbrates fundamental change in my opinion. I have said before that if blockchain will cause revolutionary change, it will be by managing dishwasher warranties rather than by overthrowing the Federal Reserve, and I stick by that opinion!\n\nSocial Segments\n\nIn the social area we have, broadly speaking, three groups to look at and respond to with new kinds of payment systems.\n\nFirst, we have an aging population. I recently looked at a project that involved a facial recognition system. You run the bank app on your phone, and then to log in you look at the phone and it logs you in, which proved to be rather popular, not with toy obsessed millennials (they were quite happy use their fingerprints), but older people who can never remember passwords or PINs (eg: me). The new technology isn’t only for kids!\n\nThen you’ve got the squeezed middle. These are people like me who have to catch the 7:52 from Woking in the morning and barely make it alive into Waterloo, scrabbling to keep up with things and very time poor. We need services that are delivered on the spot and within the correct context, and you will see that word “context"" appearing quite a lot in the offerings that are coming out next year.\n\nLastly, you have the mobile-centric millennials. For them, we have to drive payments into the channels that they use and make them vanish. In a Venmo world, a Facebook Messenger payments play is just as important as ChasePay or Walmart Pay or Samsung Pay or anything else.\n\nRegulatory Rumbles\n\nFinally, there are the regulatory trends.\n\nIn the payments world, these are by far the most important trends. It doesn’t matter if people come up with a super duper clever blockchain. It doesn’t matter if they come up with a niche way to sell it to millennials. It doesn’t matter if they come up with a terrific near-bank structure to make it all work, because actually, this is a regulated world, and regulatory trends set the envelope that they can work within.\n\nHere I will just point out two key regulatory trends that I think the blockchain world might want to pay close attention to.\n\nThe first is what people have started to call \'instant payments\'. In the UK, the faster payment service (FPS) is well established, has been fantastically successful and is enabling things on top of it already like Pingit and Paym and so on. And there’s more to come in that space.\n\nThat is also happening in other countries have started to take that route. The one great exception was always the US because the Federal Reserve has no regulatory mandate to make the banks there implement an instant payment system, and so we all thought it would be some time before instant payments appeared in the US.\n\nActually, however, in the last couple of months, there has been raft of announcements coming out of the US: The Clearing House (TCH) is working with VocaLink, Dwolla are experimenting with APIs, NACHA is moving to same day, and so on.\n\nEven in the US, instant payments will feature heavily across the next year. Once you can send money instantly from one person to another in this way, bitcoin will have to work hard to find a payments niche for the typical customer.\n\nThe second is the 2nd European Payment Services Directive, PSD2. This mandates that (amongst other things) banks have to provide open APIs to third parties by 2018. The EBA has set out three categories of those APIs:\n\nThe mandatory payment APIs which all banks will have to implement so that regulated third parties can have direct access for account information and for transaction initiation\n\nThe non-mandatory payment APIs which banks will be allowed to offer so that they can provide some unique special services, trade finance or FX\n\nThe non-mandatory, non-payment APIs.\n\nI would say that if a European blockchain entrepreneur wants to look for an opportunity to make something really interesting, really different, and really special in this space, you should be looking at, not payment services, but the services that go around them – the valued-added propositions alongside payments.\n\nHence my advice to our clients to look at the non-mandatory, non-payment APIs. Blockchain plays can use these APIs to create new services with, for (or in spite of!) banks to embrace and extend services. To my mind, the most important of these will be around identity management and authentication services, and I predict that a lot of our work next year will be in this area.\n\nHence my 2016 bumper sticker for the readers: “Blockchain is #regtech not #fintech”.\n\nWant to share your opinion on bitcoin or blockchain in 2015, or a prediction for the year ahead?

As of the morning of December 23, it sits at 99.7 million, with the landmark due in the next two days, and for a virtual currency that has the support of no central bank or government, it’s a remarkable feat.\n\n“Without a doubt, bitcoin was the strongest and fastest-growing currency in 2015,” says Sebastián Serrano, CEO and co-founder of payments processor BitPagos, which has thousands of partners in Argentina, Latin America, and Europe.\n\nSince its inception in January 2009, bitcoin’s growth has skyrocketed. While the first 50 million transactions took place during the first six years, the rest took place in 2015 alone.\n\nThis year’s Black Friday eve saw the highest volume of bitcoins traded in as single day, 2.86 million. That is over US$1 billion, based on that day’s average exchange rate.\n\nFor Nubis Bruno, entrepreneur and CPO at bitcoin trading-platform Bitex.la, bitcoin’s performance was to be expected: “It’s following the adoption curve of other disruptive technologies when it comes to promotion.” However, he warns that there is “a long transition phase for people who discover bitcoin before they learn how to use it and do so.”\n\nAlso, “businesses offering bitcoin-related services have had enough time to mature, and regulatory agencies are gradually reducing uncertainty about how they will treat bitcoin.”\n\nIn a clear demonstration of support, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) launched a bitcoin price index in May. “We are now going to use our name, reputation, and stature as a global index provider to give bitcoin values that the rest of the market can look to,” announced NYSE’s President Tom Farley.\n\nReputation is a crucial component of bitcoin, “because it’s a currency that does not depend on any bank or state entity, what gives the network its strength is users’ acceptance and trust.”\n\nInvestment Funds Eye Bitcoin\n\nIt wasn’t only bitcoin transactions that increased in 2015. Investors injected more than US$1 billion into bitcoin start-ups, almost tripling last year’s funding. Some of the world’s largest finance players ventured into bitcoin: BBVA bank, Goldman Sachs, American Express, Master Card, and even semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm.\n\n[adrotate group=”8?]\n\nIn January, bitcoin exchange Coinbase alone managed to collect US$75 million, the biggest yet for a bitcoin firm. But it was quickly dethroned by 21 Inc., which obtained $116 million from angel investors. In September, the firm delivered: it launched the first computer specifically designed to interact with the bitcoin network.\n\nAll about the Blockchain\n\nThe most discussed aspect of bitcoin in 2015, however, was neither the funding nor its price. Blockchain, the underlying ledger that keeps track of every bitcoin transaction, was the subject of much debate in the community.\n\nDevelopers, activists, and entrepreneurs alike pondered whether the network should limit the number of transactions to avoid scalability problems in the future. No one controls bitcoin, so reaching a consensus on changes is critical.\n\nBut not only insiders debated the essential technology. The banking system showed interest in adopting the blockchain, not the currency, to handle their transactions more efficiently and cheaply. Giants like JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, and Scotland Royal Bank decided to invest heavily in creating a partnership to set up a “private blockchain.”\n\nBritish bank Barclays funded three blockchain start-ups, and a Deutsche Bank official said the blockchain could “revolutionize finance,” given that “the speed of execution is so much faster for securities settlement. [And] you can see how it could reduce the capital that banks have to hold against each trade.”\n\nBut Bruno of Bitex.la believes all the buzz about “contradictory concepts such as private blockchains or bitcoinless blockchains” is the result of financial institutions trying to adapt to a new environment. Bitcoin firms should “build bridges and present [bitcoin] as a benefit for the whole industry,” he says.\n\nEven though it’s still in its infancy, blockchain applications have the potential to change much beyond the world of finance. Honduras, for instance, is seeking to build a blockchain-based land-titles registry, and other firms are developing solutions to notarize birth certificates and marriages without the need for a central authority.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'New York -- One of the more unusual financial crime stories of the year concerned two men who were charged with operating an illegal Bitcoin exchange through a now-shuttered New Jersey credit union.\n\nAs reported by CU Journal in late July, the two suspects -- Yuri Lebedev and Anthony Murgio -- were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for allegedly running an unlicensed Bitcoin exchange for the purposes of money laundering.\n\nThe two Florida-based men ran a Bitcoin exchange through a phony front-company and a small New Jersey credit union that Murgio took control of for the scheme, according to the FBI.\n\nThat credit union was identified as Helping Other People Excel (HOPE) FCU of Jackson, N.J.\n\nThe FBI alleged that since late 2013 — and perhaps before that time — the pair operated Coin.mx, a Bitcoin exchange service that enabled co-conspirators and customers to pay a fee to exchange cash for Bitcoins. ""In doing so,"" an FBI release said, ""they knowingly exchanged cash for people whom they believed may be engaging in criminal activity.""\n\nThe duo are also said to have exchanged cash for Bitcoins for victims of cyber-attacks involving ransom money. Furthermore, Murgio and Lebedev ""knowingly enabled the criminals responsible for those attacks to receive the proceeds of their crimes, yet, in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws, Murgio never filed any suspicious activity reports regarding any of the transactions.""\n\nCoin.mx exchanged at least $1.8 million for customers between October 2013 and January 2015, along with transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars to accounts in Cyprus, Eastern Europe and Hong Kong, as well as receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from bank accounts in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands.\n\nTo evade potential scrutiny, the FBI said Murgio obtained beneficial control of HOPE FCU and is alleged to have installed Lebedev and others on the credit union\'s board and transferred Coin.mx\'s banking operations to the credit union, which served as a captive for their business until early 2015.\n\nAlso, according to the FBI, the National Credit Union Administration discovered in early 2015 that substantial payment-processing activity was being run through the credit union and HOPE FCU was forced to cease that activity. However, Murgio subsequently found other overseas payment channels.\n\nMurgio and Lebedev were each charged with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, each of which carries a maximum five-year prison sentence. Murgio has also been charged with money laundering — a maximum 20-year sentence — and willful failure to file a suspicious activity report, which carries a maximum five-year sentence.\n\nIn early August, Murgio, appeared in a federal court in New York. According to court documents, he was freed after posting $100,000 bail.\n\nIn mid-November, Murgio pled not guilty following a superseding indictment. His next trial date was set for Oct. 31, 2016, according to court documents.\n\nReuters reported in early December that Lebedev pled not guilty in Manhattan federal court following the issuance of an indictment related to illegal money transactions at Coin.mx. That indictment alleged that some $247,000 in payments were made to an unidentified executive of the aforementioned credit union between May and December 2014. Such payments involved two different bank accounts and an unidentified middle man.\n\nCourt documents state that Lebedev is next scheduled to appear at a ""status conference"" on March 4, 2016.\n\nNCUA liquidated HOPE FCU last month after having placed the institution into conservatorship on Oct. 16. The agency made the decision to liquidate the credit union and discontinue operations ""after determining it was insolvent and had no prospect for restoring viable operations."" NCUA further noted that the credit union served 110 members and had assets of $626,000.\n\nLebedev still has an active LinkedIn account in which he is described as ""Principal Software Architect"" for a company called BigTree Solutions in the Tampa/St. Petersburg, Fla. area. BigTree\'s website states that it provides ""software for restaurant delivery services.""\n\nThe account claims he has been employed at BigTree since January 2015 and that prior to that date he worked as ""Lead Java Architect"" at HOPE FCU between October 2014 and January 2015.\n\nAs for Murgio, his active LinkedIn account states that he is the founder of a company called Instamanager.com of Tallahassee, Fla. Murgio\'s profile claimed he owned the company for two years before selling it in July 2010.\n\nHis account further claims that he owned an eatery called the ""101 Restaurant"" for six years until 2011 and that it was ""one of the most popular dining destinations in Tallahassee."" Murgio commented on his profile that in unloading the restaurant he ""trusted the wrong people and was not paid"" and that he is ""currently in the process of trying to reclaim this business.""\n\nOtherwise, Murgio\'s LinkedIn account makes no mention of HOPE FCU.', 'Starting on 1 January 2016, credit and debit cards denominated in the Nigerian naira will no longer be enabled for international use. The decision by the Central Bank of Nigeria to ban credit and debit card purchases abroad comes amid declining foreign exchange liquidity and aims to slow the flow of foreign exchange out of the country.\n\nNews of the ban broke via BBC. So far one Nigerian bank, Standard Charter, has informed customers of the impending change.\n\nThe Nigerian economy, the twentieth largest in the world, has been hard hit by falling oil prices, and the unofficial value of the naira has tumbled. The Central Bank of Nigeria fixed the exchange rate in February and blocked access to foreign exchange for certain kinds of imports in June.\n\nThe move to disable Nigerian credit and debit cards for international use is the latest attempt to counter the flow of foreign exchange abroad. Nigeria’s foreign exchange reserves have been in decline and are stretched increasingly thin.\n\nFor Nigerians, the new restrictions will make it harder to make purchases from foreign retailers both online and while traveling abroad. Those most likely to notice the change include wealthy Nigerians looking to buy luxury items on the international market. Some luxury goods have already become scarce in Nigeria as a result of the Central Bank’s ban on using foreign exchange for certain imports.\n\nTogether, the ban on credit and debit card use abroad and the obstacles Nigerian importers already face create an opening for Bitcoin. Already, Bitcoin has been used to make it easy for Nigerians abroad to send money home. Now, Bitcoin could help facilitate the flow of money in the other direction.\n\nUnder the restrictions that will go into place in January, Nigerians looking to make purchases abroad could buy bitcoin domestically, then use bitcoin for international purchases. Thus, people with Nigerian-denominated credit cards could continue buying goods internationally without taxing Nigeria’s foreign exchange reserves.\n\nOver the past year, Bitcoin has already been making inroads into Africa. In January, ICE3X became Nigerian’s first bitcoin exchange, allowing users to trade bitcoin in both South African rand and Nigerian naira. As a result, a framework is already in place enabling easy access to bitcoin using naira, and the growing limitations on uses of traditional currency in Nigeria could accelerate Bitcoin adoption in the country.\n\nNigeria’s foreign exchange crisis illustrates how using Bitcoin can solve some of the monetary problems involved in international trade. In this case, Bitcoin becomes a promising alternative to the naira because it makes international purchases more convenient for consumers while also easing the strain on Nigeria’s foreign exchange reserves.\n\nImage from Wikipedia/chippla.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
12/24/2015,"['During the Asian session, the Bitcoin price strengthened to $452. And this happens while we receive positive macroeconomic statistics from the US. Moreover, other currencies also grow against the Dollar. These facts suggest the activity of a large number of buyers, both in Bitcoin and other currencies, and that buyers are so optimistic that this overcomes the resistance of the Dollar. This suggests that in the short term, the Bitcoin price could resume growing.\n\nToday we expect the publication of the data on initial applications for unemployment benefits, but this shouldn’t affect the market much.\n\nToday December 24, we expect Bitcoin’s price to move in the corridor of $445- $465. The resistance level is $465. The support level is $440\n\nAs we can see, both fundamental analysis and technical analysis can not predict the movement of prices in the market accurately. Sometimes we see that the price moves contrary to forecasts, or even common sense. So this is an interesting question – what moves the price, especially the price of Bitcoin?\n\nThis analysis and forecast are the personal opinions of the author and are not a recommendation to buy or sell Bitcoins.', ""Lamar Wilson is a programmer, web developer, serial entrepreneur and loving father. He co-founded the software development firm 212ths with his long-time friend and co-founder of Fluent, Lafe Taylor. Lamar is co-founder and CEO of Fluent, a B2B payment platform built on the blockchain.\n\nAs the end of the year approaches, it is customary to begin thinking of what's next.\n\nWe try to assess what changes can be made to better our lives, our businesses and our relationships. We ask what can we do differently that will push us positively towards our anticipated outcomes.\n\nIn the spirit of this thinking, let's discuss bitcoin and blockchain technologies.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technologies are still in their infancy. Yet, millions of dollars have been invested and many companies have reaped tremendously from early adoption.\n\nBut, it's important to note that the companies that have had the most success have done so by creating a foundation for the entire industry.\n\nAs when building a house, the foundation is the first and possibly the most important element. Without it, the house would fall, and any good builder knows that you have to give the foundation a chance to cure before building on top of it.\n\nThe companies we'll list below have built a pretty solid foundation on top of the ground that the core developers provided. The only problem is, sleeping on a concrete slab can prove to be uncomfortable.\n\nEnter the age of practicality.\n\nThe next steps\n\nWith the foundation laid, it is time to begin building practical solutions to real-world problems.\n\nPeople want to put all kinds of things on the blockchain – from gold to furniture receipts. If it exists, someone has pitched that it should be on a blockchain. But the blockchain is not some magic wand that solves all problems.\n\nThe blockchain, at its core, is a database. It may be the Liam Neeson of databases, but still it's a database.\n\nThis new age of practicality must be filled with companies solving real problems – problems that could not be solved before the gift Satoshi left for us (before returning to his alternate dimension).\n\nWe as an industry must be able to look into every industry and every discipline and see what challenges a distributed, immutable ledger can really solve.\n\nWe have debated on Reddit and other forums about what can be. But the new age must be filled with companies that not only see what can be, but build what should be.\n\nWe have to embrace people from all disciplines and lend a ear to what struggles they have. We have to then be creative enough to innovate through cross-discipline association.\n\nThe good examples\n\nThere are a handful of companies that have already prepared us for this future.\n\nCompanies like Blockcypher have become the Amazon Web Services for blockchain tech. They began with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin, and because of this early versatility, can now easily create private blockchain solutions with their full suite of tools.\n\nCompanies like Coinbase and BitGo have become the 'First National Banks of Bitcoin', and are expanding to be Global Bitcoin and FX banks. They are providing a foundation for developers to build all types of transaction-heavy applications.\n\nElsewhere, Zapchain has taken full advantage of the simple API Coinbase provides for tipping to reimagine social communities.\n\nChain and the recently acquired Blockstack.io, focus (or focused) heavily on private blockchains and the tools to interact with them. R3 has done a great job of grabbing a piece of mindshare at some of the largest banks in the world, creating a foundation for meaningful engagement with incumbents.\n\nMichael J Casey at MIT Media Lab is helping to lead us toward this age by encouraging the MIT Sloan School of Management and the MIT School of Engineering to work together on blockchain technology, combining two world-class schools at a world-class institution.\n\nThese types of actions will begin to create the walls of our industry's house. They will help discover new problems that we can then solve with technology.\n\nAt Fluent, we've found a very specific problem by talking to industry leaders and professionals about issues in their supply chains. Equipped with our knowledge of blockchain technology, we were able to build a solution that will solve this problem in a way that was impossible without the core technology.\n\nThe beginning of the new year will be filled with optimism and glee, but when the confetti is cleared, we'll need to move forward toward solving real issues.\n\nBring on the age of practicality.\n\nFather and son image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

On Dec. 15, the central bank took out a series of newspaper ads warning Kenyans that the use of bitcoin is “unprotected”.\n\nThen, in an official statement on Tuesday, the bank announced that bitcoin “is not legal tender” in the country.\n\n“No protection is currently in place in the event digital currency or related platforms that exchange or hold digital money fails or goes out of business,” the statement said.\n\nBut the central bank’s disapproval is not preventing Kenyans from using bitcoin -- it becomes ever-more popular, with about 10,000 users to date, according to bitcoin statistics.\n\nThe appeal of bitcoin is that it makes international money transfers cheap. Banks take up to 10 percent commission on international transfers in the country, while bitcoin platforms in Kenya get about 3 percent, a fraction of that amount -- the exact commission varies from platform to platform, but it is always much less than that taken by banks and foreign exchange dealers.\n\nOne Kenyan bitcoin platform, BitPesa, -- Pesa being the Swahili word for money -- says that it will treat the announcement of the CBK as the first step to the acceptance of the amazing technology.\n\n“BitPesa is safe, and trading in bitcoin is very safe. Anyone who has transacted any business through us knows this for sure. Our aim is to make it cheaper for people to make money transfers,” BitPesa co-founder Elizabeth Rossiello told Anadolu Agency in an interview on Wednesday.\n\nOur business isn’t illegal, Rossielo said, and, despite the fact that the CBK had classified it as “unregulated business” the company will continue serving its customers in Africa.\n\nBitPesa, with the help of venture capital, has grown beyond Kenya, and now operates in Uganda, Tanzania and Nigeria. The company received $1.1 million in investment from a group of venture capitalists led by U.S.-based Pantera Capital.\n\nRossiello called on regulators and lawmakers in Kenya to learn about the new technology which is being used all over the world. In Kenya the business has over 4,000 registered customers who use the platform to trade.\n\n""You can pay somebody in China instantly using bitcoin. There has been $1 billion in investment from venture capitalists in 2015 alone into this technology. Two billion dollars’ worth of bitcoin is traded every day. So why would Kenya close its eyes to this, and opt out of a new technology?"" Rossielo asked.\n\nAccess to bitcoin was first popularized in Kenya by M-Pesa, a mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinancing service, launched in 2007 by Vodafone for Safaricom , the largest mobile network operator in Kenya.\n\nBut, on Nov. 12, Safaricom blocked access to BitPesa and Lipisha, the two bitcoin services on the M-Pesa money transfer service. Safaricom cited the unregulated status of bitcoin as the reason for its decision.\n\nA lawsuit by BitPesa was quashed by the court on Dec. 14, and so access to bitcoin is no longer possible on M-Pesa. BitPesa is appealing.\n\nThis, however, has not prevented bitcoin operators from providing access via the Internet and other mobile services.\n\n“As a company founded in Kenya, we built on M-Pesa; as a pan-African enterprise, we have gone above and beyond M-Pesa.” Rossielo said.', 'The price of bitcoin digital currency, which more than doubled in 2015, is poised to surge even higher next year as investors have regained confidence in its stability after the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange in 2014.\n\nBitcoin is trading for about $443, an increase from its $200 level during the beginning of the year. That\'s better than the 12-month forecast of $400 Wedbush Securities made in July (the firm has since raised its forecast to $600). According to Adamant Research, bitcoin\'s price has surged more than 900 percent since it began trading 2010.\n\nOpinions vary about how high bitcoin will rise in 2016. An unscientific poll by CoinDesk, which follows the market, found 37 percent of respondents thought prices would hit between $500 and $1,000. Another 26 percent thought it might top $1,000 as demand continues to climb.\n\nBut experts such as Michael Sonnenshein, director sales and business development for Grayscale Investments, which sponsors the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), were reluctant to provide a forecast. ""I am not concerned about a bubble,"" said Sonnenshein in an interview. ""If you go back and look at the bitcoin price chart, it\'s a series of bubbles and busts.""\n\nBitcoin hit its stride in 2015. Prices surged 80 percent during the last six months and are up 90 percent over the past three. Venture capital investments in the sector hit are running at over $900 million to date, according to Adamant Research. Among the big-named investors that have taken a shine to the online currency are venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who was an early backer of Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR), and PayPal (PYPL) co-founder Peter Thiel.\n\n""In the traditional markets we are seeing increased volatility and insecurity,"" said Tuur Demeester, Adamant\'s editor-in-chief and a bitcoin investor, in an interview. ""Bitcoin\'s fundamentals are stronger than ever.""\n\nThe digital currency is designed to be scarce. About 15 million of the 21 million bitcoins that are planned to be minted and circulated have already been created. Supplies will be further tightened this summer during what industry insiders call a ""halving event."" That happens every four years, when the number of coins that bitcoin ""miners"" mint is cut by half.\n\n""The last time this happened, there was considerable movement in the bitcoin price,"" Grayscale\'s Sonnenshein said. ""It will be very interesting to see how the market digests the halving event.""\n\nExpectations for the sector are surging. By 2025, Wedbush expects bitcoin to account for 10 percent of the $5.9 trillion online payments market and 20 percent of the $744 billion remittance market.\n\nWall Street is also keeping a close eye on the growing interest in ""blockchain,"" the underlying technology used in bitcoin among the financial services sector. Spending on the technology is expected to hit $400 million in 2014, up from $75 million this year, according to consulting firm Aite.

He has since led an activism effort to legalize ridesharing inspired by the swarm organizational model outlined in Swarmwise by Rick Falkvinge, founder of the first Pirate Party in Sweden.\n\nWe reached out to Christopher David to talk about his Free Uber activism campaign:\n\nCoinTelegraph: Ok, so for the uninformed, what is Free Uber?\n\nChristopher David: Free Uber is a grassroots campaign to defend ride-sharing against bureaucrats and red tape. We’ve been focused primarily on Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where a new transportation ordinance has created a turf war between taxi drivers and Uber drivers who are now operating illegally because of the ordinance. Free Uber is an effort to organize drivers and supporters to overturn the law and safeguard consumer choice. We believe adults should be able to make their own transportation decisions without outside interference.\n\nCT: How have you gone about spreading this message?\n\nCD: Mainly through a combination of distributing flyers around downtown Portsmouth and building up our Facebook page, with a little bit of paid advertising. Our flyer campaigns definitely had the biggest impact. On the day after one of our 10-person flyer distribution events, we’d hear reports of conversations about Uber breaking out in coffee shops and sidewalks all over the city. We thoroughly saturated the town and got everyone talking, to the point that city officials would complain about our flyers during their council meetings and in the newspaper. We definitely got our message out.\n\nCT: How is this whole operation funded?\n\nCD: As an independent entity with no legal structure or bank account, crowdfunding in bitcoin was the logical choice. Early on we put up a bitcoin address for a prize pool to incentivize activism, and a separate address for promotional expenses like flyer materials and staple guns. In total we raised about 6 BTC, mostly when the price was around $250. A lot of the activism payouts were sent when the price was up over $400, so we got extra bang for the bitcoin.\n\nCT: So this was entirely crowdfunded by Bitcoin?\n\nCD: Yes.\n\nCT: What drew you do using Bitcoin?\n\nCD: I got turned onto bitcoin back in 2012, interested mainly because I’d been following Ron Paul’s critiques of the Federal Reserve and I saw bitcoin as potentially part of a new monetary system that would come to replace the current one. Using bitcoin for this project was a no-brainer because it let us pay activists quickly with no transaction fees, with all donations and disbursements listed transparently on the public ledger of the blockchain.\n\nCT: How are activists paid? Are they official employees with salaries?\n\nCD: No employees or salaries. I’m skeptical of the salary model and I envision in the future more industries will embrace ‘gig economy' models like Uber. Nonprofits and activism certainly should, and bitcoin makes perfect sense for the payment model. For Free Uber, activist compensation was calculated primarily using a point system tied to specific tasks like commenting on relevant articles online or giving an illegal Uber ride. We had a website where activists would report tasks and see everyone’s point totals on a public leaderboard. People could request a payout at any time. For some special events we would announce a guaranteed prize pool of say 1 BTC that would be divvied up to attendees. No one got ever more than a couple hundred dollars worth of bitcoin in total, but we think the minimal prizes we were able to offer people definitely made it easier for people to get involved and stay involved.\n\nCT: Were all donations anonymous?\n\nCD: About half the donations were anonymous, though some people let us know when they donated so we knew who they were and could thank them.\n\nCT: How do you view this method of activism funding measures up next to a traditional nonprofit model?\n\nCD: Point-based gamification incentivized with bitcoin micropayments could revolutionize nonprofits in the exact same way that gig economy models like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk are slashing costs for companies needing repetitive data tasks. So far no one has cracked the nut on how to apply a similar gig economy model to nonprofits and cause organizations in a scalable fashion. But I think we have.\n\nCT: Are there any challenges presented by a non-traditional model that doesn't have the same yearly budget and operating expenses to go by?\n\nCD: The greatest challenges come from operating in a legal gray area, or sometimes directly against the law. Technology is evolving faster than government regulation can keep up. That's a good thing for human progress, but can be uncomfortable for the entrepreneurs on the bleeding edge who can face penalties or jail time. And the number of investors or users willing to join you on that bleeding edge can be severely limited compared to those operating in the false security of government control. The challenge is to capture enough margin on that bleeding edge to build a bridge back to the ordinary world, as Uber is doing to great success. They risk a lot, yet stand to gain a lot.\n\nCT: Has this funding model proved effective in getting activists to take action?\n\nCD: Yes, our approach was successful enough that we had to stop promoting the incentive system to new people because we had so thoroughly saturated Portsmouth with our message. On the days that we assigned a point value to each flyer posted, we had some activists drive from an hour away to come help. We also had online activists seemingly crawling out of woodwork to pitch in, most of whom reported their tasks anonymously. We don’t know who all those people are; in fact some of them could even have been from other countries. I do know we wouldn’t have gotten near as much activism done without the gamified incentives tied to our bitcoin prize pool. Plenty of people love to volunteer for free and that’s great, but it’s nice to be able to offer folks a little something for their time. It makes activism more sustainable and can help prevent people from ‘burning out', a problem we see a lot in activist communities. Our next step is to streamline and systematize these processes, then scale out to other geographic areas across New Hampshire and beyond. We’re focused now on the ride-sharing fight as a test case. Bitcoin plays a useful role in our approach to that fight. But moving forward we’re even more excited to build gamified activism support systems using smart contracts on blockchain 2.0s like Ethereum. The idea is to build on that bleeding edge a decentralized army of decentralizers: activists empowered with blockchain technology to flow like water around any obstacles to innovation. We are closer to that future than you might think.\n\nDonor experience\n\nCoinTelegraph also spoke to two of Free Uber’s donors about their experience using Bitcoin to fund activism through this non-traditional model. Tom Hudson considers himself a Bitcoin beginner, while Kyle Mohney considers himself to be experienced.\n\nEase of use\n\nMohney particularly liked how the donation process was more streamlined.\n\n“Of course there is a setup process for both BTC and traditional accounts. But once you've established an account, BTC is far easier to use.”\n\nGreater privacy\n\nHudson also preferred the privacy that comes with using Bitcoin as opposed to traditional methods.\n\n“Purely from a standpoint speed and ease, it's more efficient. You either scan the QR code or copy the address and send the money. No need to enter name, address, credit card, etc., etc.”\n\nTransparency and accountability to donors\n\nFinally, the public reward-based incentive system’s transparency impressed Hudson.\n\n“Outside of this realm, what is nice is the ability, if one wished, is the ability to see where the money gets spent by the charity. You have access to their ledger. While it's not 100% transparent, it does put the ability to hold the charity to standards of accountability that otherwise are not existent.”\n\nWe hope that you liked this article.

Alex Tapscott is the CEO of North West Passage Ventures, an advisory firm building early stage companies in the blockchain space.\n\nTogether, they are authors of the upcoming book, Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World.\n\n\n\nThe Internet is entering a second era, one that gives us another shot to achieve a prosperous future.\n\nYes, the digital revolution has brought countless wonders. The Internet, the World Wide Web, social media, mobile computing, geospaciality, Big Data and the cloud have all enabled advancements in virtually every aspect of life.\n\nBut when it comes to business, a careful analysis shows that the changes to date are only scratching the surface.\n\nCapitalism's basic institution, the corporation, has remained relatively unchanged. Hierarchy, vertical integration and bureaucracy – hallmarks of the industrial age – still reign.\n\nWhen it comes to the economy as a whole, the digital revolution has not had a positive impact on prosperity for most. There is real creation taking place but, paradoxically, social inequality is growing.\n\nThe economies of many developed countries are growing, but for the first time in history there is no commensurate job creation.\n\nPrivacy, the foundation of a free society, is being undermined by data 'frackers' and governments everywhere are using the Internet to create the surveillance society.\n\nTwo billion people don’t have a bank account or participate in the global economy at all.\n\nAn incomplete Internet\n\nRather than the solution, technology has been a big part of the problem, and not just because a new round of automation – robotics or disruptive business models are wiping out parts of the workforce.\n\nThe old paradigm in technology and media, whether broadcasting, print or mainframe computing, was to make things centralized and to control them with powerful forces. The recipients were passive.\n\nThe new paradigm was supposed to be distributed, controlled by everyone and empowering to active participants.\n\nHowever, the distributed Internet was dropped into an economy that has concentrated power structures with the asymmetrical ability to shape it for their own purposes.\n\nWealth, prosperity and freedom have arrived, but only for the few.\n\nWithout an economic layer to the Internet, we can’t establish each other's identity or trust each other to transact without validation from a third party like a bank or a government.\n\nQuite the opposite: It allows people to commit fraud, collect our data and invade our privacy. It excludes 2.5 billion people from the global financial system. It channels power and prosperity to those who already have it, even if they're no longer earning it.\n\nWhat if the next generation of the Internet enabled not just the communication of information but the direct communication of value and money? What if we could build businesses, send transactions directly, peer-to-peer without powerful intermediaries?\n\nEnter the blockchain\n\nWell it’s happening. The digital revolution is bringing a new and radically different platform for business and other institutions that can take us through the next quarter century of human progress.\n\nAt the core is the biggest innovation in computer science in a generation. It is the technology underlying the digital currency bitcoin – the blockchain.\n\nThis technology platform is open and programmable. As such, it holds the potential for unleashing countless new applications and as-yet-unrealized capabilities that have the potential to transform everything in the next 25 years.\n\nAt its core, the blockchain is a global database – an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions, but virtually everything of value and importance to humankind: birth and death certificates, marriage licenses, deeds and titles of ownership, educational degrees, financial accounts, medical procedures, insurance claims, votes, transactions between smart objects and anything else that can be expressed in code.\n\nThis ledger represents the truth because mass collaboration constantly reconciles it. We will not need to trust each other in the traditional sense because the new platform ensures integrity.\n\nThink trust achieved through clever code and mass collaboration.\n\nFulfilling the vision\n\nToday, the new platform enables a reconciliation of digital records – call it The Digital Reconciliation.\n\nThe Internet of Everything needs a Ledger of Everything. Business, commerce and the economy need a Digital Reckoning. Get ready for the World Wide Ledger.\n\nWe believe the truth can set us free and distributed trust will profoundly affect people in all walks of life.\n\nMaybe you're a music lover who wants artists to make a living off their art.

Or a citizen fed up with the lack of transparency and accountability of political leaders. Or a user of social media who thinks all the data you generate might be worth something – to you – and that your privacy matters.\n\nEven as we write, innovators are building blockchain-based applications that serve these ends.

You\'ll have heard of Bitcoin already, and may understand that a blockchain, in the technical sense, is the foundation. Blockchains don\'t just encompass this breakthrough technology, but a spectrum of business models, organisational structures and radical ideas.\n\nBitcoin is the first truly successful blockchain application, a digital currency, and it occupies an important space within this spectrum. Its technological capabilities are matched with a carefully balanced incentive structure. It also fosters a community around its open-source development, and third-party businesses creating applications and integrations.\n\nBlockchains are built on a history of security research\n\nFar from being an unprecedented breakthrough, with unintended consequences, the blockchain technology stack is a culmination of decades of cryptography and security research.\n\nThe 1970s cryptography breakthrough of the Merkle tree and the distributed hash tables of the 1990s combine to create autonomy, fault tolerance and scalability for distributed systems. They\'re the tools that built famous decentralised applications like BitTorrent, Napster and Freenet.\n\n>See also: Could blockchain power the Internet of Things?\n\nBitcoin\'s most impressive contribution is recognising the synergies between this field of distributed communications and file sharing systems, and digital currencies, which had seen many false starts prior to Bitcoin\'s success since 2009.\n\nThe key was Hashcash, a system proposed in 1997 to limit and suppress email spam and denial-of-service attacks. Hashcash is an algorithm that requires the sacrifice of processing power as a security mechanism. This proof-of-work creates the incentive structure and network verification that now powers cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe final step is the addition of smart contracts to the blockchain stack, a name coined by Nick Szabo as early as 1993. Smart contracts are algorithmic; a type of self-executing code which enables more complex asset transfer and the automated exchange of rights. These are the building blocks of a complete programming language, and the more advanced blockchain applications such as those envisioned by Ethereum.\n\nWhat we get is a set of security tools that are very good at coordination between mutually unknown actors and secure data or value transfer. We think of blockchains as having four key characteristics to this end: they\'re cryptography-based, distributed, peer to peer, and, in many cases, open source.\n\nInnovative blockchain applications in security\n\nAs with many open source movements, we\'re seeing the different stages of the blockchain ecosystem build out in waves: first the core protocols (Bitcoin, Ethereum and other platforms); now middleware, from Consensys; and then applications.\n\nThere\'s been some degree of consolidation on blockchain development around Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past year, although Ethereum isn\'t the second biggest token by market capitalisation.\n\nBitcoin\'s first mover-advantage and financial specialisation has granted it momentum and early market interest, while Ethereum\'s Turing-complete programming capabilities enable many other truly disruptive opportunities.\n\nGuardtime\'s security solution runs on a private blockchain, and features a cross-vertical solution replacing RSA digital signatures: its KSI (Keyless Signature Infrastructure), which uses only hash-function cryptography for signing. This prepares digital identity systems for the security necessities of the future – where quantum computers make factorisation problems like those that RSA relies on trivial.\n\nInter Planetary File System (IPFS) is a new core internet protocol that is designed to supplant the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). IPFS can address some of the most difficult security challenges that the HTTP-based internet faces: centralised hosting and distribution, and weak application of content-signing protection.\n\nUsing context-driven storage, self-certification and an incentivised blockchain mechanism, IPFS becomes a secure, permanent web, resilient against server failure.\n\nMIT\'s Enigma, based on the Bitcoin blockchain, enables any code to be run on encrypted data. In its model, data can be stored, shared and analysed without being fully revealed to a single third party, enabling trustless sharing of data and distributed computation without resorting to full transparency. This grants blockchains, even in a permissionless setup, access to the full spectrum of data visibility from fully private to public.\n\nColony.io is a decentralised schema for business based on the Ethereum blockchain. The namesake colonies present a flat organisational structure with security, incentives, flexibility and resilience built in, capable of supporting businesses in many industries.\n\nTokens are awarded to users based on fulfilled tasks and organisational decisions are made based on consensus between contributors. These tokens represent equity in the colony business and are tradable for cash.\n\nThe whole system is run on a tokenised blockchain, with an identity and reputation system and voting system complementing its blockchain. It represents a culmination of different opportunities implied by blockchains\' features.\n\nIt\'s a secure business model through its adaptability, digital identities, and democratic incentivisation. In the words of Alain de Botton, ""It’s just the sort of thing that proves capitalism can be both moral and helpful, as well as profit generating.”\n\n>See also: From ballot box to Bitcoin: how Blockchain technology could revolutionise age-old paper voting\n\nA holistic view of security\n\nWhen we think of that combination of features, we can see blockchains as a broader way of looking at security. Not only traditional endpoint protection, but a holistic approach that includes user identity security, transaction and communication infrastructure security, business security through transparency and audit, and security from malicious insiders, compromised nodes or server failure. These are all addressable with blockchains because security and privacy are central to the protocol, and not an external consideration.\n\nA holistic view is necessary to maintain today\'s connected world. The past decade of digital transformation across industries has put our lives and livelihoods in data.\n\nWhere individuals, businesses and governments are constantly locked in a battle against bugs, fraud and malicious actors, blockchains propose an alternative.\n\nThe paradigm shift blockchains represent can offer true data integrity, advanced digital identity systems and a new way for business to offer transparency for audit alongside access for third parties.', 'It may be a bit too late to get gifts quite in time for Christmas Day, but that doesn’t mean that people aren’t looking for a way to show their giving spirit. For anyone bitten by the bitcoin bug, or simply interested in spreading the joy, here’s a list of potential bitcoin gifts.\n\nFor other examples of potential last-minute gifts feel free to check last year’s Bitcoin Enthusiast Gift Guide.\n\nGive the gift of Bitcoins\n\nAs with last year, the top tier gift to give with bitcoin for Christmas this year is still Bitcoin itself. especially because spreading the love around is the reason for the season. And in keeping with that theme, is a Bitcoin Paper Wallet that could be loaded with a small amount of bitcoins.\n\nTo make it festive, there is already a wonderful Christmas-themed template available for color printers. Using the template (and a little bit of technical knowhow) it’s possible to give bitcoins via QR codes with public and private keys; and using tamper-evident gold or silver hologram-foil stickers (sold separately) could make the gift even more festive.\n\nBitcoin wallets: Trezor and Keepkey\n\nFor someone just getting into bitcoin, there’s a wide variety of ways to keep them safe. To this end, certain products have been produced for the specific purpose of doing that.\n\nFirst up is the Trezor BItcoin Wallet from SatoshiLabs s.r.o., a lightweight, hardware wallet solution reviewed here on SIliconANGLE, makes for an excellent gift as it provides a way to keep bitcoins safely on hand while also delivering an easy to use web-based wallet.\n\nThe Trezor runs only $99, which makes it a little on the expensive side (for a gift) but as a piece of hardware it comes up as a must-have. With a Trezor, bitcoin private-keys are held safely within the hardware wallet and never exposed to potential theft, it also requires user interaction any time coins are moved using a specialized screen and the web wallet interface.\n\nAs a result, Trezor wallets are a great way to cold store currency when its not being used.\n\nNext up is the KeepKey, based on Trezor’s software but designed to look a bit more sleek and refined. It works in essentially the same way with a sort of minimalist block-of-black-ice effect and a glowing screen.\n\nAlthough it is much more expensive than the Trezor, at $239, the KeepKey provides a sleek interface and UI that provides a lot of good user experience.\n\nThe 21 Bitcoin Computer\n\nReleased just this year, 21, Inc. came in with a surprise entry: a tiny Bitcoin mining machine attached to a programmable Linux computer called the 21 Bitcoin Computer.\n\nWhile running at an equally expensive $399, this is perhaps the preeminent gift for a Bitcoin enthusiast who also happens to possess programming aptitude, happens to be an engineer, or a Maker. The machine is also available on Amazon.com, which makes it very easy to purchase.\n\nWhile expensive, it also opens up a great deal of potential avenues to interact with the Bitcoin community and even give back to it. For anyone interested in tinkering and perhaps building their own Bitcoin-related project.\n\nIf there’s an engineer in your life, this is a great gift. And if you yourself are an engineer or Maker and a Bitcoin enthusiast, this is a great self-gift.\n\nMastering Bitcoin: A book written for coders\n\nPerhaps, if the 21 Bitcoin Computer is too expensive for your blood, but the fires of code and development still burn in your eyes, perhaps a book will do. As a result, look up Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies by Andreas M. Antonopoulos.\n\nThe book runs around $33.24 (or used for $23.65) and if you happen to have an Amazon Prime membership you can get it same day delivered. Or, for the electronically oriented, the Kindle edition runs on $17.99.\n\nMost Bitcoiners will know who Antonopoulos is and that he’s a major voice in the community. This book is directed towards coders, which many people who would be interested in the above 21 Bitcoin Computer would be anyway, and those just curious about how Bitcoin works and how to use it.\n\nFeatured image credit: Kyt Dotson, made with Vectorportal Blue Snowflake Background (CC).']"
12/25/2015,"['Bitcoin has reached a new technological milestone today. Since its birth in 2008, 15 million bitcoins has been mined, more than 100 million transactions have been settled by the Bitcoin network and mining difficulty is close to reaching 100 billion.\n\nAccording to the statistics provided by blockchain.info, the mining difficulty has risen by nearly 250% since January of 2015, recording the fastest annual increase of difficulty since 2008.\n\nThe number of transactions processed by the Bitcoin network have reached 100 million, as the number of daily bitcoin transactions increased by five times since January of 2015. Bitcoin experts predict that the worldwide recognition of bitcoin and established financial institutions’ growing interest towards Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain technology network have played a vital role in the growth of Bitcoin as a currency and as a technological protocol.\n\nThe market cap of Bitcoin has also reached a yearly high at around US$6.34 billion and is close to recovering from its decline in 2014, amid the collapse of then the largest bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.\n\nBitcoin, which has had one of its best year since 2013 also surpassed the growth of major reserve currencies and top-performing developing currencies such as the Malaysian Ringgit. Bitcoin has also performed exceptionally well against the world’s largest currencies including pound sterling, US dollars and Japanese yen, becoming the world’s best performing currency of the year.\n\nAlthough financial experts argue the value of Bitcoin and criticize its independence (decentralized nature), bitcoin is beginning to be recognized as an independent currency by an increasing number of central banks and financial establishments around the world.\n\nBitcoin since 2014, has almost fully recovered from its slump following the Mt. Gox heist and all the negativity portrayed by media outlets and news networks around the world.\n\nSexenbir lezbiyen porno kültürünüze yeni renkler katacak yüzlerce porno videolar? ile art?k sizlerle.\n\nContinuing this success, in 2016, bitcoin experts predict that bitcoin will reach another milestone as a developing currency.', 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'The Christmas isn’t turning out to be merry for Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is struggling near the overhead resistance of $465. It is now trading 1.28% lower at $450.89, raising concerns that the market participants might pull out their funds in the holiday season. As a result, several technical indicators are also showing declines.\n\nImage\n\nWe advised in the previous Bitcoin price technical analysis Target Achieved that traders should book at least partial profits in their long positions. And for today’s analysis, we will again be using the 4-h BTC-USD price chart from BITSTAMP.\n\nChart Structure – Bulls once breathed heavy when bitcoin pierced $450 quickly. The cryptocurrency, however, is expected to take support near $440. The 100 4-h SMA of $443.3904 and the 20 4-h SMA of $446.4165 will keep the cryptocurrency afloat from a near-term perspective.\n\nMomentum – Fueled by the rebound, the Momentum indicator topped 20 but has dropped to 8.4800 as the market remains undecided about the future course of action.\n\nMoney Flow Index – The MFI has retraced a bit from the overbought territory, and now reads a value of 73.8766.\n\nRelative Strength Index – Just when it looked that bitcoin is gaining strength and may defeat the bears, bitcoin price declines as does the RSI. The current RSI value is 52.9251.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe small dip is not an attractive buying opportunity. Market participants are best advised to wait for levels close to $440 or create long positions only after the resistance has been breached. Until either of these happens, bitcoin may remain sluggish.\n\nAnother technical point that market participants must consider is that with this being the last week of the year, the volume will remain relatively low and may return only post the first week of January. Also, no surprises in volatility are expected.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Antonopolous, Roger Ver, Bernard v. NotHaus, Jeffrey A. Tucker, Michael J. Casey and more.\n\nIn 2015, cryptocurrencies have gained wide public attention. If you want to know what Bitcoin is, this is the film to watch this holiday season. The title says it well. This 60-minute documentary film is a masterpiece, depicting both the history and future of money. It reveals the hidden threads in the development of money and where it is going.\n\nOne could not ask for a better introduction to the invention of the blockchain. The directors, Hoffmann and Watchulonis were able to successfully depict what this disruptive technology embodies, revealing the past lineage of money and the serious problems inherent in its current centralization, while at the same time presenting a viable alternative. I found this to be a fine work, historically documenting the birth of crypto-currencies.\n\nFrom the mental ledger to metal coinage and the separation of the Federal Reserve note from gold, the film succinctly portrays the history of money. It does an excellent job of showing the inner working of the fractional reserve process and its fraudulent nature, without explicitly saying it.\n\nI found it especially impressive how the directors made the intersection between money and technology, helping all to see money as an innovation. By comparing it to the invention of the printing press and the move from the horse and buggy to the automobile, it places Bitcoin in historical context as a further advancement of technological innovation.\n\nThe film is concise and very engaging. It packs in a lot of information, yet paces it well, helping the audience digest the material. The selection of speakers was great and the way their voices were woven into the visual narrative was very effective. It was nice to see leading figures in the Bitcoin space taking turns speaking for this groundbreaking technology.\n\nThis is a very entertaining and educational film, a mandatory watch for anyone who’d like to witness the unfolding history of money and get a sense for its future. This is not a typical Bitcoin enthusiast film that tends to frame it only in a positive and optimistic light, yet it is true to the revolutionary spirit of this innovation without watering it down.\n\nBy the end of the film, one may come to realize how money is something vital like water, yet many rarely know what it truly is. After watching Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It, one walks away with a deeper understanding. I finally found a film that I would direct my friends and colleagues to the next time they ask me: “What is Bitcoin?”\n\nFor more information and the access to the film, visit the website or Vimeo page.\n\nNozomi Hayase, Ph.D., is a writer who has been covering issues of freedom of speech, transparency, and decentralized movements.

Potential buyers can make an offer in an auction which closes on the 2nd of January 2016.\n\nBoth buyers and sellers serviced by BTCrow had transacted more than 7.5 mil BTC in total during the four years of its existence, according to the website. The profit numbers reach more than 25 BTC monthly.\n\nThe site was launched in June 2011 with the aim of adding trust and reliability to online bitcoin transactions at minimal cost, while protecting both buyers and sellers via an independent dispute resolution service. Users pay a 1.5% escrow fee.\n\nThe original founder sold Btcrow in 2012 to two students, who according to the words of one of them ‘were trying luck in bitcoin’. He has been the sole owner since 2014.\n\n“I have been forced to choose between my priorities and I can\'t dedicate this business more time. And it needs more and more time. On the other hand I think it\'s a good time to sell,“ he explains to Cointelegraph.com the reasons for selling a profitable venture.\n\n“We have received many offers, many false but there are a few serious offers, a particular one of a known company. This site was a pioneer, began and facilitates the exchange of bitcoins for services and is part of bitcoin history. I hope the next owner will improve it, grow, and keep it running for many years.“\n\n“The BTCrow.com sale is very interesting. While they choose to sell/auction it in a very unique way, it is also quite hard to prove their claims. For example they claim they earn more than 25 bitcoins a month, yet they say \'Total 7,519,238.91 BTC in transactions\',"" founder of competing service Escrow my Bits comments for Cointelegraph.com.\n\n“I would say our services are quite different. BTCrow has more or less stayed the same for many years. Escrow my Bits is the first and currently only escrow company offering escrow that can be pegged to a fiat value. We also have many more first of a kind escrow features in the works that no one has ever done before. I would say BTCrow\'s biggest value comes from their name and reputation. They have been around for years and have ratings and trust from much further back than any other escrow company.“\n\nSafePay BTC placed a bid\n\nOperator of another competitor SafePay BTC was surprised with BTCrow\'s offer for sale. “Escrow is a much needed service in the Bitcoin community, due to the number of scams, and lack of regulation like in traditional banking. But, the lack of government involvement is why we like Bitcoin. Escrow is a self-regulating measure protecting both consumer and seller.“\n\nSafePay BTC is a very similar service today, though they have many things planned for next year. MultiSig is the most important and asked feature starting in January, in addition to site integration tools, similar to how PayPal works, so e-commerce sites and markets can utilize third party escrow in their checkout process. “We will also be starting a list of legit vendors, and a feedback and Q&A system, that can be integrated into stores, further protecting consumers and helping great vendors who deliver,“ says the operator to Cointelegraph.com\n\n“It\'s sad to see BTCrow go, and to be truthful, we have also placed a bid and would love the opportunity to expand our customer base, while adding other value added services to the industry. It\'s too bad they have not provided an open way to communicate with them, because I would like to speak with someone about a serious offer that would be beneficial to the overall community as well as BTCrows\' customers.“\n\nWe hope that you liked this article.

Full bitcoin nodes enforce the rules of the bitcoin network by serving a full copy of the bitcoin blockchain and validating blocks and transactions.\n\nBTCC is the first bitcoin exchange and first mining pool to donate and deploy full bitcoin nodes for the maintenance of the bitcoin network.\n\nWhile bitcoin miners are rewarded with bitcoins for generating transaction confirmations, nodes are not compensated for hosting the blockchain database and relaying transactions.\n\nBTCC’s chief operating officer Samson Mow said that the company deployed the nodes in order to do its part in helping maintain the bitcoin network. The network has seen a 19 percent decrease in viable nodes over the past year to 5,280 at the time of publishing.\n\n“As a proponent and believer in bitcoin, we see both supporting core development and well as the bitcoin network itself as our duty,” Mow said. “The nodes we deployed today will help to preserve the network as the number of full bitcoin nodes continues to decrease.”\n\nBTCC’s chief technology officer Mikael Wang said ten of the nodes were set up as DNS seed nodes. BTCC DNS seed nodes provide the bitcoin community with secure and trusted full nodes to help new nodes synchronize with the network.\n\n“BTCC has deployed ten powerful DNS seed nodes with unrestricted network access that are publicly available for anyone to use when hosting their own bitcoin core nodes,” Wang said. “Simply connect to seed.btcc.com:8333.”\n\nA list of all the full bitcoin nodes that BTCC has deployed is available at: https://bitnodes.21.co/nodes/?q=%2FBTCC%3A0.11.2%2F\n\nBTCC deployed 19 percent of the nodes in Germany; 19 percent in Singapore; 13 percent in China; 21 percent of the nodes in the United States; and 7 percent each in Australia, Brazil, Ireland, and Japan.\n\nBTCC’s chief executive officer Bobby Lee said BTCC deployed the nodes across five continents in order to ensure that people across the world can easily access the bitcoin network.\n\n“Most reachable full bitcoin nodes are located in the US,” said Lee. “So we intentionally distributed the nodes we donated in countries that rank low on the full bitcoin node geographic distribution list.

Currently at 0.00191BTC, Ethereum is in a no trade zone as discussed in the previous technical analysis.\n\nSole Positive – The technical indicators are, however, rebounding from the respective oversold levels.\n\nImage\n\nI would like to discuss the resistance and support levels for Ethereum now. To serve this purpose, I will be using the 4-h ETH-XBT pair.\n\nChart Structure – The pair has been registering lower tops and lower bottoms for the past 10 trading sessions. Connecting the two highs in this period puts the resistance at 0.0020BTC. The support is the lowest level of this period i.e. 0.0018BTC.\n\nMoving Averages – A cluster of moving averages, namely the 50 4-h SMA of 0.0020BTC and the 20 4-h SMA of 0.00196BTC, are most likely to keep the gains limited.\n\nMomentum – The Momentum indicator is turning its head up and attempting to cross the 0-level.\n\nMoney Flow Index – The MFI hit an extremely oversold level of 5.2295 before rising to 16.7496.\n\nRelative Strength Index – Similar to the action in MFI, the RSI also seems to have bottomed out. The latest value of 14 4-h RSI is 41.6922.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is hard to imagine any shock fluctuation in price as investors celebrate the year-end. Calmness in the bitcoin market is also expected to keep Ethereum relatively stable. A consistent bearish pressure may cause the pair to test the lows of 0.0018BTC.\n\nMy recommendation would be to avoid trading the pair at the current level. Traders should build short positions when the price nears 0.0020BTC or create long positions when the price hits 0.0018BTC.\n\nI do not expect volatility to pick up anytime soon.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Such an assumption was expressed by 4th largest search engine worldwide and the most popular website in Russia, Yandex, CTO Grigory Bakunov during his lecture about the main trends of 2016. If applied, the blockchain will make scoring much easier and faster.\n\nThe growing possibilities of artificial intelligence allow the building of wide networks able to gather authentic information about any user based on his/her accounts in social networks and other sources. Furthermore, they are able to process huge volumes of information, making the process of credit scoring much faster.\n\nThe only problem is that they often used algorithms that are unexplainable in any human language. Grigory Bakunov states:\n\n“Artificial intellect often divides people into clusters using algorithms which are difficult to explain in human language. And that may be a problem because people often come to a bank asking why they can’t have a loan. And you’ll definitely owe them an explanation”.\n\nHowever, the development of artificial intelligence is fast enough. It is probable that soon enough it will be able to explain its own actions. And that’s why Bakunov assumes it to be a good platform to apply the Blockchain for automatic credit score that will not need any additional checks by human experts.\n\nYandex (Russian: ??????) is a Russian Internet company which operates the largest search engine in Russia with about 60% market share in that country.

He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'Blockchain recordkeeping startup Factom has issued new public comment on its long-contentious partnership with the government of Honduras, calling a previously announced proof-of-concept ""stalled"".\n\nIn a new blog post, Factom CEO Peter Kirby spoke generally about the difficulties of working with global governments on land title projects, but also addressed past questions about the validity of the initiative.\n\nControversy arose earlier this year when doubt was cast on a rumored partnership between Factom and the government of Honduras, which would have found the Central American nation securing land title records with distributed ledger technology.\n\nThe development was reported by Reuters in May in what has since been a widely cited use case by blockchain technology proponents, though government officials have never publicly commented on the deal.\n\nKirby wrote:\n\n""We put [reporters] directly in touch with Honduras officials, who for reasons of their own were unable to comment. We also had approval before going on the record with any of these news organizations.""\n\nThe comments address lingering accusations by prominent members of another blockchain community that Factom allowed the rumors to develop in part to mislead the public about the success of its services.\n\nMired in debate\n\nThe new comments address statements made in a Counterparty Skype group earlier this year wherein a Factom founder suggested the company had perhaps not completed a deal with Honduras as previously indicated.\n\nIn comments to a representative of Counterparty, founder and chief architect Paul Snow stated that the deal\'s status was inaccurately reported and that it was then stalled because of ""political issues"".\n\nSnow claimed that the article ""mangled"" the company\'s message, and that representatives of the Honduran government ""preferred"" that the story wasn\'t corrected.\n\nThe remarks were seized on by detractors seeking to suggest that Factom used confusion regarding the nature of the agreement in a bid to create excitement for its various crowdfunding initiatives, a charge Factom Kirby denied.\n\nKirby said then that Factom had received a letter of intent from the Honduran government to begin recording land title records for La Ceiba, the fourth largest city in Honduras, on the bitcoin blockchain. The CEO further said Factom never suggested there was more to the deal than the proof-of-concept, though it was seeking to push the project nationwide.\n\n""The project is moving forward and there will be a point in the project where we become sanctioned by Congress, where a new entity will be made to manage land title permanently. We have to demonstrate in a small locality and then proceed,"" Kirby told CoinDesk in August.\n\nFactom foundation chairman David Johnston echoed these statements in interview at the time.\n\n""We\'ve been pretty open,"" he said. ""The progress is still moving forward, we\'re building tools and we\'ve agreed to work on a pilot program.""\n\nEvidence unclear\n\nFactom provided documents then that offered new details on the nature of the proposed deal. These include emails with officials from the Honduran government and a non-binding letter of intent for a joint venture between the two sides.\n\nRepresentatives from the company asserted that Snow\'s remarks had been taken out of context and that Factom does not believe the Reuters report to be inaccurate. Kirby suggested the intricacies of the deal could have been better stated.\n\nHowever, in new statements, Kirby provided an explanation for the why the Honduran government has not been vocal about its interest in the Factom blockchain.\n\n""The letter of intent between the Honduran government and Factom/Epigraph includes some amount of non-disclosure language, so we\'ve had to be quiet about the business model and non-technical details of the project,"" Kirby said.\n\nAt press time, the Honduran government had not responded to CoinDesk\'s requests for further clarity.\n\nHonduras image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Here\'s our look at what happened:\n\nGAW Miners\n\nDuring 2015, GAW Miners fell into deeper and deeper trouble amid growing controversy over its mining operations and failed promises that it would honor a $20 price floor for its own cryptocurrency, paycoin.\n\nLater staff exits and email leaks were the death groans of a company that had always courted controversy, and eventually it faded away mid year with a whimper rather than a bang.\n\nIn the months since, GAW has been the target of civil lawsuits from customers seeking to recoup losses, and worse, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged the firm\'s former CEO, Josh Garza, with the fraudulent sale of unlicensed securities and operation of a Ponzi scheme.\n\nMining ASIC Technologies\n\nMining ASICs Technologies (MAT) was declared bankrupt by a Maastricht, Netherlands, judge at the close of last year, after company CEO Marc Coumans filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe firm used a business model that asked people to pay 35% upfront for its SHA-256 miners but when they failed to appear for most customers in September 2014, the word \'scam\' started being bandied about on forums.\n\nThe firm responded that there was a problem with the air cooling of the chips, and that orders would be sent when resolved.\n\nBar for a few customers, this never happened and after a tiff with the producer of its chips, the firm eventually declared itself bankrupt, saying calls for refunds had finished it off.\n\nBonafide\n\nBitcoin reputation startup Bonafide ceased operations in November, less than one year after receiving funding $850,000 from investors including Blockchain Capital and Quest Venture Partners.\n\nThe startup offered an API that provided reputation data to bitcoin firms offering exchange, wallet and other consumer services.\n\nCo-founders Karthik Balasubramanian and Brian Moyer stated their belief that the movement of investor interest away from consumer-facing applications for the technology was one factor in their demise.\n\nDeclines in consumer bitcoin spending were also cited as a factor in the shut down.\n\nBrawker\n\nBitcoin buying service Brawker closed its doors at the end of April, citing competition and workload issues.\n\nThe decentralized platform, launched in April of 2014, allowed consumers to purchase products with bitcoin.\n\nThe firm told us at the time: ""Buying bitcoin with credit cards is now possible, and more and more merchants are accepting digital currencies.""\n\nBTC Guild\n\nLong-running bitcoin mining pool BTC Guild ceased operating at the end of June, citing the finalization of New York State\'s BitLicense as a primary motivator. It said at the time that the pool could not afford any legal threats that may arise as a result of the New York regulatory framework.\n\nA spokesperson for the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) later told CoinDesk ""miners and mining pools are exempt from the BitLicense"".\n\nButtercoin\n\nUS bitcoin marketplace Buttercoin closed in April, despite launching with $2.1m in investor backing in late 2013.\n\nSaying that it was ""100% secure and solvent"", the platform blamed a lack of VC interest for its closure, saying:\n\n""With the dip in bitcoin interest among Silicon Valley investors, we weren\'t able to generate enough venture capital interest to continue funding Buttercoin.""\n\nSince its closure, the US market has seen the rise of a number of regulated US exchanges including those offered by Coinbase, Gemini and itBit.\n\nCoinTerra\n\nBitcoin mining company CoinTerra filed for bankruptcy in January, saying it would be unable to repay unsecured investors and naming hundreds of creditors in its filing.\n\nCoinTerra had between $10m and $50m in assets, with liabilities within the same range, according to court documents. The firm has filed for bankruptcy protection, meaning it is likely to liquidate all assets in its bid to repay secured creditors.\n\nThe closure came soon after CoinTerra became the target of a lawsuit launched by C7 Data Centers, a data center colocation services provider based in Utah.\n\nHarborly\n\nTexas-based bitcoin exchange Harborly shut down in August saying the closure was a result of insufficient resources to run both the firm and a separate project that co-founder and CEO Connor Black described as ""a growth hacking tool and service"".\n\nDigital currency regulation also played into the decision.\n\nBlack said: “We were surprised again and again by the resources it took to effectively adhere to the compliance requirements laid out in the US and beyond.”\n\nSwarm\n\nDecentralised crowdfunding platform Swarm shut down in September following an internal dispute and cash issues, according to CoinTelegraph.\n\nThe firm allowed companies to raise funds via cryptographic shares using Swarm\'s own cryptocurrency.\n\nSwarm\'s co-founder and CEO Joel Dietz allegedly wrote in a blog post (now removed) that three factors brought Swarm\'s downfall: the co-founder and designer left the project, the Swarm team disagreed about making its software open source and a deal with a startup accelerator that drained $200,000 from Swarm\'s coffers.\n\nThe startup has nonetheless relaunched under a new governance model, while recently publishing a roadmap for 2016.\n\nYacuna\n\nEuropean exchange Yacuna made an orderly retreat from trading in November after a relatively short time in the cryptocurrency space. In an email to customers it informed them of the closure and advised customers to withdraw all funds.\n\nTalking about the closure, executive director and chief compliance officer Mark Caruso told CoinDesk:\n\n""We offered the service for free since we believe in the disruptive potential of blockchain technology. However, the lack of significant volume and a growth rate that remained below expectations led to the decision of shutting down the service.""\n\n37coins\n\nBitcoin remittance startup 37coins closed its doors back in August, when the company announced it was halting operations and closing its SMS-based wallet. The firm left users until 30th December to withdraw their funds.\n\nNotable participants in Plug and Play\'s bitcoin startup group, 37coins aimed to use low-cost cellphone technology as a means to enable cheap transactions.\n\nAccording to the team, however, development came across hurdles that ultimately proved insurmountable.\n\nDid we leave anyone out?

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'There are times we feel like Bill Murray in the movie “Groundhog Day.” No matter what we do, we’re subjected to the same surroundings and events. Everywhere we look, we see the same thing over and over again. Things tend to become routine. It becomes mundane and to a degree, even a little irritating.\n\nToday is one of those days; a recently published article details a think tank’s findings regarding bitcoin and digital currency, and surprise! Those involved in the think tank believe that insurgencies and radical groups ranging from drug cartels to terrorist units will find further ways to misuse digital currency for the sake of evil.\n\nIn a 100-page report, the think tank participants explain:\n\n“Deploying a virtual currency may be an attractive alternative for non-state actors who look to disrupt sovereignty and increase their own political or economic power by displacing state-based currencies. Virtual currency deployments are particularly attractive in developing countries and in countries undergoing internal turmoil, where the existing financial infrastructure is either insufficient or weakened.”\n\nIf you feel you’ve seen anything like this in the past, you likely have. Government officials and news outlets have been reporting for years about how bitcoin and digital currencies are magnets for wrong-doing. They’re particularly favored among terrorist groups, as these currencies allow them to stay anonymous. We’ve all heard this before, and many of us don’t really want to hear it again.\n\nFurthermore, there’s really no reason whatsoever for us to hear it again. For one thing, bitcoin has been established as anonymous, but it’s certainly not private. There’s a big difference. It’s likely no one will see your name following a purchase of bitcoin or anything with bitcoin, but don’t forget that the transactions are recorded. The blockchain presents evidence of occurring transactions, and sometimes, that’s all it takes to find someone. We’re forgetting… Those behind Silk Road were eventually caught.\n\nFurthermore, the idea that bitcoin is used by terrorists as often as we believe is heavily open to question. A new UK report claims to have proven that bitcoin is not a criminal risk (or at least not much of one, specifically), and other platforms, such as bitcoindaily.com confidently state that terrorists employ much more nefarious methods of earning their funds, and bitcoin is an uncommon source.\n\nThe trouble is that bitcoin, despite being around for a solid seven years, is still not fully understood, and those who would seek to regulate it and rule it are likely looking for reasons to do so. Heck, there’s certainly money to be made in regulation. With every bitcoin company in New York having to pay $5,000 for a BitLicense, the cash is bound to stack up…\n\nBut even more so, a certain level of ignorance still hovers within the digital currency arena, and despite our growing knowledge of bitcoin and its crypto-cousins, many still believe virtual money to be the root of all evil.\n\nBut one thing’s for sure… We cannot ignore the advancements and changes occurring in the bitcoin spectrum on an almost daily basis, and as things progress, the day must come when people finally lower their veils and see the power that bitcoin can and does present the financial sector once and for all.\n\nSource', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

And, some say, in the best way possible.\n\nThe movie grossed $247mil in opening weekend box office sales – an all-time record.\n\nAt the time of writing (Dec 25), Star Wars: The Force Awakens has generated $765mil revenue from worldwide tickets sales after a two-week run in theaters. Although worldwide sales are not setting any record, the movie will release in China during January 2016, and combined with repeat viewing, sales may yet push TFA to beat Avatar’s $2.8bil revenue.\n\nOld Deal\n\nIronically, Disney’s stock price took a hit of 4% last week as concerns over Disney’s ESPN franchise increase. The (cable) sports network delivered an average of 45% of Disney’s annual operating profits. However, a growing trend away from cable subscriptions amongst US consumers is putting question marks over ESPN’s ability to remain profitable or even sustainable.\n\nBig Favorite\n\nNonetheless, the singular success of Star Wars: TFA continues blazing across headlines and in the hearts and minds of both stalwart and new fans. The exuberance and hope with which audiences have spent money during uncertain economic times speaks volumes about the sentiment – and wider social mood – that surrounds Star Wars. The question of what exactly it means remains open, and here are some socionomic thoughts:\n\nSocial Mood\n\nDuring times of positive social mood, media and culture that reflects the optimism, hope and aspiration of society tend to “blockbust”. Similarly, the same franchises can flop during times of pervasive negative mood when audiences prefer movies themed in sympathy to their sombre sentiment. A good example is the popularity, during the 1920s, of Superman who fell out of favor, during the Great Depression’s 1930s, to the more psychologically complex and nocturnal Batman.\n\nThe original Star Wars film came out of the inflationary recession of the 1970s to unprecedented popular reaction. It was as if the world embraced the escape (to a “galaxy far, far away“) and the archetypal tale of Good overcoming the Dark side.\n\nEpisode 7, similarly, promises audiences that “The Force Awakens” and the review consensus is that the movie is a retelling of “A New Hope” with some old characters and some new characters inheriting the torch. On the one hand, the overwhelming audience response could be an indication of a rising positive social mood, and on the other, the reaction may be interpreted as a yearning for escapism from prevailing negative social mood to a less complicated world.\n\nMood Riffs\n\nAccording to this article, there are two concurrent moods existing in the world today: negative mood across most of the globe (with either real or prospective economic recession) and positive mood in the US, where there is an economic resurgence.\n\nPositive Mood In The US\n\nWith the US able to raise interest rates – for its own good and, arguably, to the detriment of most other countries – we may be at the start of a new era of positive social mood in the US.\n\nThe mood seems to already be established, as expressed in (mostly) positive consumer sentiment and popular culture expressions such as “The Martian” (expansionism via space exploration) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which embodies a “new hope” of optimism and is breaking box office records as evidence of the psychology it embodies.\n\nEmerging Markets Downbeat\n\nThe US has made a resurgence and may soon reclaim its former status as “the world’s only superpower”. China, by retrospectively embracing western capitalism, was always going to be one step behind the creators of the global capital finance system.\n\nAt the first sign of weakness (a slowdown in demand for Asian exports), the US captains of finance were able to turn the tables to their advantage. Whether this had been a deliberate and pre-calculated move on the part of the US, or a strange confluence of circumstances, it is difficult to see China – and even the BRICS collective – achieve any significant economic growth in the new era of US economic and psychological hegemony.\n\nHold US Dollar and Bitcoin\n\n\n\nAs we see in the charts, the US dollar has already begun a long-term rally. Other central banks can only devalue their currencies in an attempt to remain competitive – not versus the US – but in a side-show where their country economies are in competition with each other.\n\n\n\nIn this new dispensation, Bitcoin could conceivably be dominated by US interests too. Capital flight risk forces Chinese authorities’ hand in restricting bitcoin usage, and a depreciating yuan could, eventually, leave Chinese miners unprofitable. Consider, too, that the next block-reward halving in mid-2016 will force seismic shifts in the mining industry.\n\nBlockchain Embrace\n\nMeanwhile, the optimism and growth manifesting in the US has embraced the blockchain and Bitcoin, and combined with the coming block-reward supply halving, the implication is a long-term rally for bitcoin price, too.\n\nWe cannot be sure who exactly is buying in the CNY exchanges. On the surface one could say it is Chinese investors fleeing yuan depreciation and capital controls. However, the largest Wall Street shadow banks also have branches in China, and it may be their whale activity that was responsible for driving the year-end advance in those mainland exchanges. If it is Chinese money, then the first restrictions against Bitcoin should see Chinese investors sell bitcoin with urgency.\n\nRisks Remain\n\nWhile there is positive mood in the US, the long-term trend for bitcoin and the dollar should remain up. Any disruption (and reversal) to this long-term trend will most likely come from outside of the US where credit default risk will only continue increasing. A critical debt default, somewhere, will be sufficient to send the credit dominoes falling – and they all, in the end, lead back to the US and its Federal Reserve.\n\nSo, a time of change. Enforced by the engine of markets: social mood. The larger risk to the world economy persist, and its Achilles Heel remains credit deflation – a risk that is sustained by negative sentiment in the majority of the globe.\n\nMay the Force Be With You.\n\nFinal Thoughts…\n\nThis analysis is provided by xbt.social.\n\nGlobal Economic Outlook is published every Monday on CCN.LA Readers can follow Bitcoin price analysis updates every day on CCN.LA\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe writer trades Bitcoin.

Blockchain, so heißt es, wird das Finanzwesen revolutionieren. Denn Netzwerke ermöglichen direkte Transaktionen ohne die Institute in Anspruch nehmen zu müssen. Jetzt heißt es: Angriff ist die beste Verteidigung.\n\n""Sie sollten diese Technologie genauso ernst nehmen, wie sie die Entwicklung des Internets in den frühen 90ern genommen haben."" Diese Worte über Blockchain stammen aus dem Mund von Blythe Masters, ehemalige Investmentbankerin der US-Bank JP Morgan und Chefin eines Start-Ups namens Digital Asset Holding – in den USA ist sie eine Berühmtheit. Unter anderem gehört sie zu den Miterfindern der Credit Default Swaps, die als Brandbeschleuniger der Finanzkrise gelten.\n\nNicht alle stimmen in ihre Jubelarie auf die Netzwerk-Technik mit ein. Investor Warren Buffet etwa glaubt nicht daran. Doch die Mitarbeiter der Innovativ-Labore nahezu aller Großbanken treibt die Blockchain-Idee derzeit um. Eigentlich aus reiner Not. Die Analysten der Deutschen Bank schrieben im Juli: ""Die Blockchain-Technologie ist eine der ersten wirklich disruptiven Ideen aus dem Fintech-Bereich."" Disruptiv, also zerreißen, kann Blockchain die Macht der Banken über die Finanztransaktionen. Auslandsüberweisungen, Kreditvergabe und der Handel mit Aktien – das alles könnte dank Blockchain künftig ohne die Vermittlung der Institute funktionieren. Gut für die Kunden, sie müssten dafür dann eigentlich keine Gebühren mehr zahlen.\n\nEine Blockchain ist zunächst ein digitales Netzwerk. In diesem Netzwerk können sich zwei Menschen direkt Werte übermitteln, beispielsweise Geld gegen Aktien. Einen vertrauenswürdigen Mittelsmann wie eine Börse braucht es dazu nicht mehr, da beide Parteien dem Austausch persönlich zustimmen können. Die Blockchain löst innerhalb von Minuten die Transaktion aus. Zum Vergleich: an einem ganz gewöhnlichen Aktiengeschäft in Europa sind bis zu sieben Parteien beteiligt und er kann zwei Tage dauern.\n\nBitcoin als Türöffner\n\nBekannt ist die Blockchain-Technologie durch die Kryptowährung Bitcoin geworden. Sie basiert auf einem solchen Netzwerk. Über Apps wie MyCellium können Verbraucher bereits heute Geld – das von Bitcoins in andere Währungen umgerechnet wird – an den Banken vorbei direkt überweisen. My Cellium generiert für jeden Nutzer einen Schlüssel, mit dem er in der Blockchain angemeldet ist. Während in der Bitcoin-Welt ausschließlich die Digitalwährung transferiert werden kann, lassen sich in ""Etherium"", einer anderen Blockchain, die 2013 entwickelt wurde, beliebige Werte in sogenannten ""Smart Contracts"" übertragen und handeln.\n\nDie US-Bank Goldman Sachs hat Anfang Dezember geschrieben, dass Bitcoin lediglich der Eröffnungsakt für Blockchain gewesen sein könnte und die Technologie nun in den Mittelpunkt rücke.\n\nSchwergewichte schließen sich zusammen\n\nRund 300 Start-Ups weltweit sollen sich derzeit mit Entwicklungen rund um die Blockchain befassen, die meisten davon sitzen in den USA und in Großbritannien. Zwischen Januar und September haben Risikokapitalgeber laut Bitcoin-Blog ""Coindesk"" 462 Millionen Dollar investiert, doppelt so viel wie im Vorjahreszeitraum. Das für die Bankenlandschaft spannendste Projekt ist derzeit R3 CEV. Hier haben sich 30 Finanzinstitute zusammengeschlossen – neben Goldman Sachs sind Schwergewichte wie die Bank of America, JP Morgan, die Royal Bank of Canada, Credit Suisse, UBS und die Deutsche Bank sowie die Commerzbank dabei. Sie verfolgen ein Ziel: Ein eigenes Blockchain zu bauen und die demokratische Idee von Finanztransaktionen ohne Banken als Vermittler im Keim zu ersticken.\n\nDazu passt auch die Analyse der Deutschen Bank unter dem Titel ""Angriff ist wahrscheinlich die beste Verteidigung"". Allerdings versprechen sich die Banken auch deutliche Ersparnisse: Marktstudien gehen davon aus, dass 15 bis 20 Milliarden Dollar weltweit bis 2022 eingespart werden können.\n\nMehr zum Thema 04.11.15 Kurs steigt kräftig Bitcoin erlebt Wiederauferstehung\n\nEin Start-Up in Mainz tummelt sich ebenfalls in der Blockchain. Brainbot heißt die junge Firma von Heiko Hees. Er berät Banker nicht nur bei der Einführung und der Nutzung von auf ""Etherium"" basierenden Blockchain-Lösungen, er achtet auch darauf, dass die Vorgaben der EU-Regulierungsbehörden in den ""Smart Contracts"" implementiert sind.\n\nBis aber ein anwendbares Buchungssystem entsteht, werden noch einige Jahre ins Land ziehen. Doch es gibt bereits konkrete Blockchain-Projekte: Die US-Börse Nasdaq etwa bietet Unternehmensanleihen über die Tochter Linq via Blockchain an.

And there\'s been a divergence between bitcoin and the technology that underpins it — blockchain.\n\nBlockchain, which uses complex cryptography to regulate and record transactions, is in the ascendancy, with millions of dollars flowing into the technology and banks lining up to experiment with it.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the leading consumer bitcoin companies — digital wallets, payment processors, and exchanges — are being forced to adjust or rethink their business models in the face of slower than expected consumer uptake.\n\n""It’s naive to think there will only be one blockchain""\n\nAccording to Jeremy Millar — the co-author of one of the most extensive reports to date on the corporate ecosystem emerging around the digital currency — the issue is that the markets for bitcoin and blockchain have already fundamentally divided.\n\n""I’m looking at this in terms of market development and what I’m saying is the market of people who buy blockchain to implement financial services is fundamentally different as a market to bitcoin,"" Millar told Business Insider.\n\nMillar, a partner at boutique technology investment bank Magister Advisors, recently co-wrote an extensive, 75-page report on the two sectors.\n\n""A cryptocurrency market will have exchanges, it will have brokers, it will have speculators, it will have payment networks,"" he says. ""The features of blockchain as a market are institutional adoption, integration with existing business processes, IT planning and budgeting, evaluating technology replacement.""\n\nIn other words, the two products are pitching at different audiences — one to consumers and currency speculators, the other to corporate IT departments.\n\nThe crucial element in understanding all this is that while bitcoin\'s blockchain is the best known, it\'s not the only one. Blockchain is shorthand for the complex cryptography-based software underpinning the network. It regulates transactions and records who owns which bitcoins. It\'s faster, cheaper, and quicker than traditional payment methods.\n\nBut the technology can be duplicated with private blockchains, and Millar says: ""I think it’s a bit naive to think there will only be one flavour of blockchain.""\n\nSo even if blockchain becomes the norm in banking, it doesn\'t necessarily mean bitcoin will rise with it.\n\n""Emerging markets are much more bitcoin native""\n\nBut Millar thinks bitcoin will find a home in emerging markets. He says: ""Emerging markets are much more bitcoin native. Look at an area like Argentina, where there are capital controls, challenges in the local financial institutions, and there’s a need to do cross border payments.\n\n""If I am running a commerce warehouse in the Philippines or Argentina, my supply chain even at a small scale is going to have many currencies and many areas where there could well be capital controls, fluctuating exchange rates, volatility, what have you.\n\n""In those environments, the ability to get into bitcoin — the ability to get out of the local currency into something that’s portable — has value in and of itself. For me and you here in London, getting into bitcoin doesn’t offer us much value.""\n\nIn this case, bitcoin\'s global scale is a unique advantage over any rival digital currency using blockchain technology. Millar says that while he expects there to be multiple blockchains, he thinks there will be only one dominant digital currency. And, barring any big upset, that will be bitcoin.\n\nHe continues: ""I’ve talked to people who are building bitcoin services in places like Argentina. They’re not appealing to hipsters. They’re trying to help people manage their pay roll or supply chain.\n\n""When you go and talk to the exchanges and the wallets they say the same thing — 90% of bitcoin is held by wealthy individuals for speculation. But 90% of the transactions are commercial transactions."" And most of those transactions are coming from emerging markets.\n\n""If you were to start TransferWise today, you would look at bitcoin""\n\nThat\'s not to say there isn\'t going to be a bitcoin market in the UK, but Millar believes it will look pretty different.\n\n""What you’re going to see in Europe and North America is the development of bitcoin inside, and that is people who are building next generation financial services will be incorporating bitcoin at least in their strategic thinking in terms of payment rails and how they store value.""\n\n""You may or may not choose to use it, but if you were starting a consumer finance business today, particularly one around payments or exchanges of value, I believe you would have to look at bitcoin,"" Millar says.\n\nThe advantages offered by bitcoin from a business perspective — it\'s faster, cheaper, and gives you more control — will make it attractive to new consumer fintech businesses starting up. Once again, its the scale of bitcoin that gives it an advantage over rivals.\n\nThe founder of international payments startup TransferWise was recently dismissive of bitcoin, but Millar says: ""I believe if you were to start TransferWise today, you would look at bitcoin.""\n\n""The existence proof of someone doing this is Circle in the US. Circle [a bitcoin-based payments app] is revolutionising the way people pay by creating the features of how people actually pay for things as a group. It’s actually much more like WhatsApp than traditional internet banking.""\n\n""You can [build that on traditional payment networks] but the reason why you integrate bitcoin is because you control the ledger, you control the exchange of value, and you cut out traditional payment rails to reduce costs and increase flexibility.""\n\nWith this ""bitcoin inside"" set-up Millar envisages, bitcoin becomes almost invisible. It\'s effectively relegated from a currency to simply the mechanics of payment — under the hood rather than a logo on the dashboard.\n\nPayments app Circle is right now trying to appeal to a wider audience by pitching the appeal of bitcoin to people who want to use dollars. Circle is effectively offering the benefits of the blockchain to people who don\'t want to use bitcoin.\n\nIf more businesses move this way it could anger bitcoin purists who see it as a revolutionary technology that deserves to be front and centre. It\'s also seen by many as an ideological tool. Still, it could also give bitcoin a much needed second wind in the west that could transform it into more than just an asset for speculators.', ""About The Author\n\nDaniel is a bitcoin investor and journalist for numerous news outlets in the financial sector.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Dr. Peter R Rizun is a managing editor for Ledger— the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency research. The deadline for submissions for Ledger\'s inaugural edition is 31st December, 2015.\n\nWhat a long, strange trip it’s been! Only four years ago, and two years after it started as a novelty in 2009, Reuben Grinberg published the first academic article on bitcoin, ""BitCoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency,"" in the 2011 issue of the Hastings Science & Technology Law Journal.\n\nSince then, the pace of bitcoin research has accelerated to the point where it justifies its own peer-reviewed journal: Ledger.\n\nIn this article, I present a ""Top 10"" list of research papers published in 2015. The editors at Ledger think of each of them as ""the one that got away"", because they represent the kind of research that the journal supports.\n\nWhile this list is by no means authoritative (and most certainly subjective), it reviews some of the year’s most influential papers, and presents several others that were praised in academic circles but received little exposure within the bitcoin community.\n\nWe watch with excitement as increasing numbers of people begin to comprehend bitcoin’s potential ramifications on our future world, and we look forward in anticipation to the results from cryptocurrency work and discovery that will undoubtedly come in 2016.\n\nThe list is a broad mix of papers from engineering, the sciences and economics that contributed to the nascent field of cryptocurrency research.\n\n10. SoK: Research Perspectives and Challenges for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies\n\nAuthors: Joseph Bonneau, Andrew Miller, Jeremy Clark, Arvind Narayanan, Joshua A. Kroll and Edward W Felten.\n\nGiven bitcoin’s cypherpunk roots, its scattered documentation, and its lack of a formal specifications, Bonneau, Miller, Clark, Narayanan, Kroll and Felten complete the monumental tasks of producing the ""first systematic exposition of bitcoin"".\n\nWritten in the form of a review article, the paper collects, organizes and synthesizes a huge body of prior work — from academic sources spanning three decades, to IRC logs, online discussion forums and developer mailing lists.\n\nThey identify three components of bitcoin’s design that can be decoupled and analyzed individually: (1) transactions and scripts, (2) consensus and mining, and (3) the peer-to-peer communication network.\n\nThey also speak to the mystery of how a quarter century of academics was unable to discover what (apparently) came intuitively to Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThis is a must-read article for those interested in quickly getting up to speed on the current state of computer science research in cryptocurrency.\n\n9. Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network\n\nAuthors: Ethan Heilman, Alison Kendler, Aviv Zohar and Sharon Goldberg.\n\nSecurity researchers have been eager to identify new attack vectors against the bitcoin network since the authors of the ""selfish mining"" paper garnered praise and publicity in 2013.\n\nPresented in August during the 24th USENIX Security Symposium in Washington, DC, authors Heilman, Kendler, Zohar and Goldberg reveal the ""eclipse attack"", in which the attacker ""monopolizes all of the victim’s incoming and outgoing connections, thus isolating the victim from the rest of its peers in the network"".\n\nThe attacker can then trick the victim by feeding him misinformation about the state of the ledger, or coopt the victim\'s computing power for its own nefarious purposes.\n\n8. Confidential Transactions\n\nAuthor: Gregory Maxwell\n\nThat there is a strong desire for financial privacy in bitcoin comes as no surprise, given the community’s historically libertarian leanings. Possibly no one has made more of an impact fostering privacy-enhancing techniques than Gregory Maxwell.\n\nFollowing up on his 2013 invention of ""coinjoin"", in this report Maxwell presents his latest cutting-edge research. ""Confidential Transactions"" is a technique that permits users to hide the values of their payments from the public, yet — with novel cryptographic methods— present sufficient information to allow miners to verify that the sum of the coins transacted is preserved.\n\nImplementing confidential transactions in bitcoin requires significant protocol changes; however, experimentation is currently being carried out on Blockstream sidechains.\n\n7. Does Governance Have a Role in Pricing? Cross-Country Evidence from Bitcoin Markets\n\nAuthor: Robert Viglione\n\nIn this paper, PhD candidate Robert Viglione statistically proves an inverse relationship between economic freedom and bitcoin price premiums.\n\nHis methodology represents a potential market-based — rather than expert-defined —measure of economic freedom that is updated in real time, rather than annually. This might provide us with data needed to run event studies that document the market’s perception of elections, for example.\n\nIt also shows that even at this early, volatile stage, bitcoin is generating useful macroeconomic data.\n\n6. Bitcoin in Islamic Banking and Finance\n\nAuthor: Charles W Evans\n\nConsidering that Muslims make up about 25% of the world’s population, and that bitcoin is free of interest, Professor Charles Evans argues that the overlap between hard-money advocacy and Shari\'a-compliant finance is large enough for these two communities to build intellectual bridges.\n\nThis paper has put bitcoin on the radar of many people previously far-removed from cryptocurrency, resulting in a surprising amount of attention from Muslims worldwide.\n\n5. Bitcoin-NG: A Scalable Blockchain Protocol\n\nAuthors: Ittay Eyal, Adem Efe Gencer, Emin Gun Sirer and Robbert van Renesse\n\nAs a follow-up to the influential 2013 manuscript on selfish mining, Cornell investigators Eyal, Gencer, Sirer and van Renesse do not disappoint.\n\nBitcoin-NG is a radical scalability proposal that employs ""micro blocks"" and ""key blocks"" to bypass the tradeoff between transactional throughput and latency in bitcoin’s present peer-to-peer communication network.\n\nIn addition to benchmarking the performance of their proposal using a large-scale bitcoin-network simulator, the authors also introduce several novel metrics such as consensus delay and mining power utilization for quantifying the security and efficiency of blockchain protocols.\n\n4. Digital Currencies\n\nAuthor: Bank of International Settlements, Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures\n\nIn its November report, this Bank of International Settlements committee recognized bitcoin’s distributed ledger technology (the Blockchain) as a ""genuinely innovative element within digital currency schemes"".\n\nThe report states that such ledgers may offer lower costs to end users compared with existing centralized arrangements and that digital currencies such as bitcoin might address gaps in traditional payment services.\n\n3. Should Cryptocurrencies be Included in the Portfolio of the International Reserves Held by the Central Bank of Barbados?\n\nAuthors: Winston Moore and Jeremy Stephen\n\nIn this working paper from the Central Bank of Barbados, economists Winston Moore and Jeremy Stephen conclude that holding a small portion of reserve assets in bitcoin could be beneficial to the small island nation.\n\nThe appropriate portfolio allocation could both improve returns and increase diversity against speculative attacks, without significantly affecting the volatility of the reserve balance.\n\nThe authors recognize that ""digital currency could become a key currency for settling transactions"" and that it is necessary for central banks to evaluate their potential impact.\n\nThis paper is significant because it reveals the emerging worldwide recognition of bitcoin as a useful store of value among central bank authorities.\n\n2. The Bitcoin Backbone Protocol\n\nAuthors: Juan A Garay, Aggelos Kiayias and Nikos Leonardos\n\nAlready with 24 citations attesting to its impact, ""The Bitcoin Backbone Protocol"" provides one of the first ""provable security"" models for a cryptocurrency\'s consensus algorithm.\n\nAuthors Garay, Kiayias and Leonardos ""extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol,"" framing their analysis in terms of two novel properties they refer to as common prefix and chain quality.\n\nThe common prefix property relates to the network’s ability to converge upon a single history, while the chain quality property describes the degree to which a malicious entity can gain an advantage in excess of its mining power.\n\nTheir results align with those from Eyal and Sirer (selfish mining) and in fact broadly generalize the underlying concepts.\n\n1. The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments\n\nAuthors: Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja\n\nIn perhaps the most influential paper of 2015, Poon and Dryja present their invention: the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which is an extension of two-party payment channels applied in such a way as to permit instant transactions between any number of participants.\n\nLightning transactions are normal bitcoin transactions, but— except for rare cases — are not actually posted to the Blockchain. Because the bulk of the transactional data is stored privately, lightning transactions are expected to be significantly less expensive than on-chain bitcoin transactions, thereby enabling affordable micropayments.\n\nPoon and Dryja’s vision may soon be realized, as Blockstream continues to work towards making the Lightning Network a reality.\n\nResearch paper image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Uskottiin, että rahaa pystyvät luomaan vain keskuspankit ja kansallisvaltiot. Pelkistä biteistä muodostuva raha olisi liian helppo kopioida ja väärentää.\n\nSalaustekniikoiden ansiosta tilanne on muuttunut. Verkkoon on syntynyt tekniikka, jonka avulla nimettöminä pysyvät osapuolet voivat yhdessä tehdä suurta luottamusta vaativia asioita — kuten pitää kirjaa toistensa rahoista ja niiden käytöstä.\n\nTämän niin sanotun lohkoketjun (block chain) odotetaan mullistavan monia tietojen säilyttämiseen liittyviä toimintoja. Ensimmäinen käyttökohde on digitaalinen raha eli kryptovaluutta.\n\nBitcoinin lyhyt historia\n\nBitcoinin historia on lyhyt, mutta sitäkin mielenkiintoisempi. Lohkoketjun idean esitteli Satoshi Nakamoto vuonna 2008 netin keskustelualueelle lähettämässään dokumentissa. Ensimmäiset Bitcoinit louhittiin vuoden 2009 tammikuussa.\n\nAluksi raha oli hyödytöntä, koska sillä ei voinut ostaa mitään. Bitcoin oli tekninen keksintö, joka kiinnosti vain nörttejä.\n\nYksi heistä oli suomalainen Martti Malmi. Hänestä tuli Nakamoton oikea käsi, joka osallistui ensimmäisten Bitcoin-ohjelmien koodaamiseen ja levitti tietoa uudesta maksutavasta muillekin.\n\nMalmi ei koskaan tavannut Nakamotoa henkilökohtaisesti, eikä tavannut kukaan muukaan. Kaikki yhteydenpito Bitcoinin keksijään tapahtui verkon keskustelualueilla ja sähköpostissa. Kun Bitcoinin suosio alkoi kasvaa, Nakamoto lakkasi vastaamasta viesteihin ja katosi verkosta.\n\nNakamoto lienee pseudonyymi, eikä hänen todellista henkilöllisyyttä ole onnistuttu selvittämään. Joko Nakamoto haluaa suojella yksityisyyttään — ja nyttemmin suurta varallisuuttaan — tai sitten taustalla on jotain ihan muuta. Villeimpien arvioiden mukaan todellinen kehittäjä voisi olla NSA:n kaltainen tiedustelupalvelu.\n\nTiedot tallessa lohkoketjussa\n\nTarkkaan ottaen Bitcoin ei ole raha vaan pelkkä vaihdannan väline. Kyse ei voi olla rahasta, koska sillä ei ole keskuspankin tukea eikä virallista vaihtokurssia. Näiden puuttumisesta huolimatta Bitcoin on lyhyessä ajassa osoittautunut toimivaksi maksutavaksi globaalissa maailmassa.\n\nNimi Bitcoin viittaa kolikoihin, mutta todellisuudessa rahat ovat pelkkiä desimaalilukuja. Yhden Bitcoinin (BTC) arvo vuoden 2015 lopussa oli noin 300 euroa, mikä tekee siitä epäkäytännöllisen kalliin. Yleinen käytäntö on ilmoittaa hinnat tuhannesosina eli milleinä. Esimerkiksi 10 mBTC vastaa noin kolmea euroa.\n\nPohjimmiltaan Bitcoin-rahat ovat bittejä, jotka matematiikka sitoo toisiinsa. Bittirahaa säilytetään omistajansa tietokoneen tai älypuhelimen lompakko-ohjelmassa. Jokaiseen rahaerään liittyy 33 merkkiä pitkä julkinen osoite sekä vastaava yksityinen (salainen) avain, jolla rahaa voidaan siirtää.\n\nKoska pitkien osoitteiden kirjoittaminen olisi työlästä, apuna käytetään puhelimen kameraa ja mustista pisteistä koostuvaa QR-koodia. Tietokoneella toimittaessa osoitteet kopioidaan leikepöydän kautta.\n\nMaksutapahtuman yhteydessä lähettäjä ilmoittaa verkkoon, minkä Bitcoin-erän hän on siirtämässä ja mihin osoitteeseen, sekä allekirjoittaa siirron omalla yksityisellä avaimellaan. Verkko tarkistaa siirron oikeellisuuden ja lisää tiedon tapahtumasta lohkoketjuun.\n\nLohkoketju on tuhansiin netissä oleviin koneisiin hajautettu tietokanta, joka sisältää tiedot kaikista rahansiirroista. Uudet siirrot kirjataan louhinnan tuloksena syntyviin lohkoihin, jotka ketjutetaan tiivistefunktion avulla aiempien perään.\n\nTiivistefunktio on yksisuuntainen, joten merkinnät jäävät pysyviksi. Kerran tehtyjä rahansiirtoja ei voi peruuttaa eikä samaa rahaa käyttää useampaan kertaan.\n\nKoska lohkoketju on julkinen, kuka tahansa voi tarkastella kaikkia rahansiirtoja. Niistä ei silti voi tunnistaa rahaliikenteen osapuolia, sillä tietoa osoitteiden haltijoista ei ole.Osoitteet voivat lisäksi olla kertakäyttöisiä.\n\nKun rahat ovat pelkkiä bittejä, tietoturvan merkitys korostuu. Jos tietokoneelle murtaudutaan ja hyökkääjä saa haltuunsa lompakko-ohjelman tiedoston, hän voi siirtää kaikki rahat itselleen.\n\nNiin ikään lompakon haltijan kannattaa huolehtia lompakkotiedoston varmuuskopioinnista, jotta älypuhelimen varastaminen tai kiintolevyn hajoaminen ei johda rahojen menetykseen.\n\nBitcoin-varat voi suojata myös tulostamalla yksityisen salausavaimen ja saldotiedon paperille. Näin syntyvä paperi on melkein kuin yksityinen, itse painettu seteli. Se käytetään lukemalla tiedot takaisin lompakko-ohjelmaan ja siirtämällä raha sieltä maksuna eteenpäin.\n\nBitcoinin vaikutukset\n\nBitcoinilla voi ostaa netistä tavaroita ja palveluita. Älypuhelimen lompakko-ohjelma mahdollistaa maksamisen myös perinteisissä kaupoissa. Digirahan suurimmat vaikutukset ovat kuitenkin toisaalla.\n\nPankit veloittavat usean prosentin välityspalkkioita rahansiirroista maasta toiseen, etenkin jos kyse on Afrikan tai Aasian maasta. Siirtotyöläiset joutuvat maksamaan kalliisti lähettäessään palkkarahojaan perheelleen.\n\nKehitysmaissa ihmisillä ei useinkaan ole pankkitiliä, mutta heillä on puhelin ja nettiyhteys. Bitcoinin avulla he voivat siirtää rahaa puhelimesta toiseen ilman pankkien apua.\n\nLänsimaissa Bitcoin mahdollistaa ensi kertaa rahan ja valtion erottamisen toisistaan. Kansalaisten omaisuus voi säilyttää arvonsa, vaikka kansallisen valuutan arvo romahtaisi. Bitcoinin arvo hyppäsi ylöspäin Kreikan velkakriisin kärjistyessä. Vaikka käteisnostoja automaateilta rajoitettiin, Bitcoin toimi normaalisti.\n\nBitcoin-siirrot toteutuvat muutamassa minuutissa ja liki ilmaiseksi. Siirtoa voi nopeuttaa pienellä transaktiomaksulla. Nopeusero on tuntuva jopa Suomen kaltaisessa kehittyneessä pankkimaassa, jossa tilisiirto pankista toiseen kestää vähintään päivän.\n\nLaajamittainen digivaluuttaan siirtyminen mullistaisi koko pankkialan. Ruotsalaisen piraattipuolueen perustaja Rickard Falkvinge rinnastaa kehityksen sähköpostiin: Bitcoin tekee pankeille saman mitä sähköposti teki postin kirjejakelulle.\n\nDigirahan käyttöä on yhtä vaikea jäljittää kuin käteistä rahaa, mikä aiheuttaa omat lieveilmiönsä. Bitcoineja käytetään maksuvälineenä netin huumekaupoissa ja haittaohjelmat vaativat niitä lunnaiksi salakirjoittamistaan tiedostoista.\n\nSuomen pankki on linjannut, ettei Bitcoinia voida rinnastaa perinteiseen rahaan, ja että sen käyttöön sisältyy takaisinlunastukseen ja arvon säilymiseen liittyviä riskejä. Käyttö on kuitenkin täysin laillista.\n\nVerottaja on ottanut kantaa virtuaalivaluuttoihin elokuussa 2013. Sen mukaan Bitcoinia voidaan käyttää osapuolten kesken rahaliikenteeseen, jolloin vero määräytyy rahanarvoisen edun mukaan. Mahdollinen valuutan arvonnousu on tavanomaista pääomatuloa, mutta tappiot eivät ole vähennyskelpoisia.\n\nPilviä Bitcoinin taivaalla\n\nMonet ovat hankkineet digirahaa puhtaasti sijoitusmielessä. Mikäli Bitcoinin käyttö jatkaa leviämistään, sen arvo tulee todennäköisesti nousemaan, sillä kolikkojen määrä on rajoitettu.\n\nBitcoin-valuutan yllä leijuu kuitenkin tummia pilviä. Nakamoto ei osannut ennakoida rahan suosiota eikä siirtojen määrää. Lukuisat pienet rahansiirrot uhkaavat tukkia verkon, mikä pidentää läpimenoaikaa. Louhinta on tarkoituksella erittäin tehotonta ja kuluttaa sähköä muutaman ydinvoimalan verran. Teknisiä parannuksia on kuitenkin vaikea tehdä, koska millään taholla ei ole määräysvaltaa lohkoketjun tekniikkaan.\n\nMahdollista on sekin, että Bitcoinin rinnalle nousee jokin toinen virtuaalivaluutta, jonka kehittämisessä on otettu oppia aiemmista kokemuksista. Ollakseen luotettava valuutan pitäisi syntyä avoimilla markkinoilla ja olla yhtä demokraattinen kuin Bitcoin. Näitä ehtoja on vaikea täyttää.\n\nBitcoinista riippumatta lohkoketjun tekniikka mullistaa monia toimialoja. Pankit suunnittelevat yhteistä tietokantaa tilitapahtumiensa tallentamiseen, Nasdaq-pörssi kaavailee listaamattomien osakkeiden kauppaa ja Kreikka on suunnitellut perustavansa julkisen maarekisterin lohkoketjun varaan.\n\nEi siis ihme, että arvostettu The Economist -lehti kutsui lohkoketjua äskettäin nimellä ”trust machine”, luottamuskone.\n\nLOUHINTA LUO RAHAA TYHJÄSTÄ\n\nKuka tahansa voi luoda uusia Bitcoineja omalla tietokoneellaan. Uuden rahan luominen tyhjästä on yksi digirahan erikoisimmista piirteistä. Siksi siihen liittyy myös eniten väärinkäsityksiä.\n\nLouhinta-termi (engl. mining) tuo mieleen kaivosteollisuuden ja jalometallien erottelun malmista, mutta sana on keksitty vain havainnollistamaan digitaalista prosessia. Louhinnan perimmäisenä tarkoituksena on tehdä lohkoketjun väärentämisestä niin työlästä, ettei se kannata. Sivutuotteena syntyy uusia kolikoita, joilla louhijat palkitaan.\n\nLouhinta tarkoittaa salaustekniikassa käytetyn SHA-256-tiivistefunktion laskemista yhä uudelleen ja uudelleen, kunnes tuloksena on ehdot täyttävä lopputulos. Tiiviste on merkkijonosta, kuten dokumentista tai sähköpostiviestistä, laskettu vakiomittainen lukusarja. Funktio on rakennettu niin, että yhdenkin merkin muuttuminen merkkijonossa tuottaa aivan erilaisen tiivisteen. Funktiota ei voida kulkea toiseen suuntaan eli on käytännössä mahdotonta keksiä merkkijono, joka tuottaisi juuri halutun tiivisteen.\n\nUuden rahan luominen ei ole vaikeaa, sillä SHA-256:n laskeminen on teknisesti helppoa. Jotta rahan syntyvauhti pysyisi hallittuna koneiden määrästä riippumatta, Bitcoiniin on lisätty pari nerokasta yksityiskohtaa.\n\nEnsinnäkin louhintaa säädetään niin sanotulla vaikeusparametrilla (difficulty). Mitä useampia koneita louhii rahaa, sitä tiukemmat vaatimukset (nollien määrä) verkko asettaa uusille rahaerille. Näin varmistetaan, että uusia kolikoita syntyy keskimäärin 10 minuutin välein.\n\nToiseksi järjestelmä hidastaa keinotekoisesti uuden rahan luomista. Tällä hetkellä jokainen uusi erä sisältää 25 kolikkoa, mutta arvo puolittuu noin neljän vuoden välein. Heinäkuusta 2016 alkaen erässä on enää 12,5 kolikkoa ja vuodesta 2020 eteenpäin 6,25 kolikkoa.\n\nKeinotekoinen niukkuus luo inflaation, joka varmistaa rahan arvon säilymisen. Ilman sitä yhä tehokkaammat tietokoneet louhisivat ja tuottaisivat rahaa kiihtyvään tahtiin ja sen arvo romahtaisi.\n\nJoskus vuoden 2041 tienoilla uutta rahaa syntyy niin vähän, ettei kahdeksan desimaalia enää riitä. Louhinta loppuu, kun kaikki 21 miljoonaa kolikkoa on louhittu. Sen jälkeen lohkoketjun ylläpidon täytyy perustua transaktiomaksuihin.\n\nBitcoinin alkuvuosina louhinta oli helppo tapa tehdä rahaa, koska louhijoita oli vain muutama. Silloin jopa tavallisella pc-koneella pystyi voittamaan kymmeniä kolikoita päivässä.\n\nTällä hetkellä vuorokaudessa syntyy 24 x 6 x 25 eli 3 600 uutta kolikkoa, joiden arvo 300 euron kurssilla on 1,1 miljoonaa euroa. Koska louhijoita on tuhansia ja tehokkaimmat laitteet kokeilevat miljardeja tiivisteitä sekunnissa, todennäköisyys voittaa uusia kolikoita itselle on marginaalisen pieni.\n\nLouhintaa hallitsevat erityisesti SHA-laskentaan kehitetyt prosessorit. Maailmalla on suuria konesaleja täynnä erikoislaitteita louhimassa Bitcoin-rahaa. Työ vaatii kalliita laiteinvestointeja ja kuluttaa runsaasti sähköä. Louhinnan kannattavuus riippuu energian hinnasta, muiden louhijoiden määrästä — sekä tietenkin Bitcoin-kolikon arvosta.\n\nBITCOININ ARVO HEILUU\n\nYhden Bitcoinin arvoksi sovittiin alussa 0,10 dollaria, mutta kiinnostus uutta maksutapaa kohtaan nosti arvon moninkertaiseksi. Ensimmäinen piikki koettiin kesällä 2011, jolloin kolikon arvo käväisi 10 dollarissa, mutta palautui vajaaseen kolmeen. Seuraava huippu nähtiin kaksi vuotta myöhemmin, jolloin kurssi ponnahti 200 dollariin ja vuoden 2014 alussa kiinalaisten kiinnostus siivitti kurssin hetkellisesti yli 1000 dollarin. Sen jälkeen arvo on vaihdellut 200–400 dollarin välillä (euroissa hieman vähemmän).\n\nNe onnelliset, jotka säilyttivät alkuaikojen Bitcoineja, rikastuivat rahan arvon tuhatkertaistuessa. Tarinoita on monia. Toukokuussa 2010 eräs ohjelmoija maksoi 10 000 Bitcoinilla kaksi pitsaa, joiden arvo tämän päivän kurssilla olisi yli kolme miljoonaa euroa. Toinen muisti jättäneensä tietokoneen kiintolevylle bitcoin-lompakon ja etsi miljoonien arvoiseksi muuttunutta romukonettaan kaatopaikalta, mutta turhaan.\n\nKeskuspankin puuttuessa Bitcoinin arvo määräytyy puhtaasti kysynnän ja tarjonnan perusteella, joten heilahtelut voivat olla jatkossakin suuria. Tältä osin Bitcoin muistuttaa enemmän pörssiosakkeita kuin perinteisiä valuuttoja. Rahan käyttäjille heilahtelut ovat myrkkyä: kuka haluaa maksaa valuutalla, jonka arvonnousu voi tehdä ostoksista tuplasti kalliimpia? Tai säilyttää lompakossaan rahaa, jonka arvo voi puolittua?\n\nKunnes kurssi vakiintuu, Bitcoineja kannattaa käyttää ostoksiin vain vaihtamalla niitä juuri ennen maksua. Vastaavasti kauppiaan kannattaa vaihtaa saamansa Bitcoinit välittömästi takaisin perinteiseksi rahaksi kurssiriskin minimoimiseksi.\n\nVARO DIGIHUIJAREITA\n\nLiikkuivatpa rahat sitten seteleinä tai bitteinä, suuret summat vetävät puoleensa varkaita ja huijareita. Tunnetuin skandaali sattui helmikuussa 2014, kun maailman suurin Bitcoin-pörssi lopetti yllättäen toimintansa Tokiossa. Muutaman sadan miljoonan dollarin arvosta asiakkaiden Bitcoineja hävisi rytäkässä.\n\nBitcoinin vanavedessä on syntynyt joukko muita kryptovaluuttoja, mutta mikään niistä ei ole yltänyt lähellekään esikuvansa arvoa tai uskottavuutta. Eräät valuutat ovat osoittautuneet pyramidihuijauksiksi, joissa varomattomat ovat menettäneet oikeat rahansa.\n\nSuomessa eniten huomiota on herättänyt Onecoin (www.onecoin-finland.com). Sen luoneen yhtiön pääpaikka on Bulgariassa, mutta monet avainhenkilöt ovat suomalaisia. Onecoinia levitetään verkostomarkkinointina, jossa vanhat jäsenet hyötyvät uusien rekrytoimisesta.\n\nRahamarkkinalakien kiertämiseksi Onecoin myy koulutuspaketteja, joiden sisältö on kuitenkin kopioitu netistä ja plagioitu kirjoista. Paketin mukana tulee joukko louhintaoptioita, jotka voi muuttaa myöhemmin Onecoineiksi. Verkoston oman ilmoituksen mukaan lähes 10 000 suomalaista on lunastanut 100–18 800 euron hintaisia koulutuspaketteja toivoen valuutan arvon nousevan Bitcoinin tapaan.\n\nKeskusrikospoliisi tutki vuoden 2015 kuluessa Onecoinia, mutta ei löytänyt riittävästi perusteita rikossyytteen nostamiseksi. Tiedotteessaan KRP kuitenkin varoitti, että ”lupaukset ylisuurista tuotto-odotuksista eivät ole realistisia”.\n\nEpäilyttäväksi Onecoinin tekee se, ettei valuutan arvo määräydy vapailla markkinoilla, vaan yhtiön sisäisessä pörssissä. Lohkoketju ja louhinta tapahtuvat yhtiön omalla koneella, joten ulkopuoliset eivät pysty varmistumaan niiden aitoudesta. Epäselvää on sekin, mihin louhintaa ylipäätään tarvitaan, kun kyse on yhtiön omasta rahasta eikä hajautetusta lohkoketjusta.', ""Sometimes it doesn’t take high-tech wizardry to catch a cyber criminal.\n\nAt least that’s the lesson from a young IRS agent, Gary L. Alford, who first uncovered the identity of Silk Road boss Ross Ulbricht using Google searches.\n\nBy the middle of 2013, Ulbricht had built Silk Road into a “dark web” marketplace that facilitated the sale of enormous amounts of contraband, including $300,000 in heroin per day, according to The New York Times .\n\nAnd though multiple government agencies, including the FBI, were on the hunt for Ulbricht, they didn’t know his name, only his moniker: “Dread Pirate Roberts.”\n\nAlford, an IRS agent who had been assigned to work with the DEA on the case, was the one to finally solve the puzzle of Ulbricht's identity.\n\nHow did he do it?\n\n“I’m not high-tech, but I’m like, ‘This isn’t that complicated. This is just some guy behind a computer,’” Alford had said to himself, according to The New York Times. “In these technical investigations, people think they are too good to do the stupid old-school stuff. But I’m like, ‘Well, that stuff still works.’” So he decided to use old-school tactics.\n\nWhat ended up finally working was a fairly simple Google search. Alford used “advanced search” on Google to look for content posted between certain dates. That method led him, in late May 2013, to a chat room post by someone named “altoid,” that was created right before the Silk Road went online.\n\n“Has anyone seen Silk Road yet?” altoid asked, according to The New York Times. “It’s kind of like an anonymous Amazon.com .”\n\nBecause the post was so early, Alford suspected it must have come from someone involved in Silk Road. And when he looked through all of altoid’s posts, Alford came across a post that had been deleted, but that showed up in the thread of another user's reply.\n\nIn that post, Altoid had given an email address: rossulbricht@gmail.com.\n\nFrom there, all that remained was searching on Google for Ross Ulbricht. Alford discovered he was a guy from Texas who had suspicious overlapping interests with Dread Pirate Roberts. In particular, a love of certain free-market and libertarian thinkers. Bingo.\n\nAlford was ecstatic when he brought his bosses a name and location for a man who turned out to be Dread Pirate Roberts. The problem? His bosses didn’t immediately listen, and brushed him off.\n\nBut Alford didn’t give up on the Ulbricht lead, and eventually uncovered more information that helped capture Ulbricht and bring down Silk Road, though the work of the FBI and other agencies was also instrumental.\n\nYou can read Alford’s full story at The New York Times ."", 'Auch in diesem Jahr trennte sich in der Bitcoin-Industrie die Spreu vom Weizen.\n\nNach einer nennen wir sie mal “Wild West Periode”, in der jeder der den Drang dazu verspürte sein eigenes Bitcoin-Startup gründen konnte, setzen sich allmählich die großen und professionellen Unternehmen durch – meist gestützt durch sehr solide Finanzspritzen.\n\nWährend einige Unternehmen für reichlich positive Schlagzeilen sorgten, konnten mindestens genauso viele Unternehmen nur ihre Kapitulation und Pleite verkünden.

12/28/2015,"[""Digital Asset Holdings’ head of business development, Beth Shah, said assertions that the company was facing challenges in raising funds were inaccurate but she declined to provide further details. All of the potential investors declined to comment.\n\nThe challenges that Ms. Masters is facing reflect in part the increasingly difficult environment facing start-ups of all sorts as investors have begun to worry that the tech industry has been overhyped and overvalued, pushing down values for companies both public and private.\n\nShe is also contending with the difficulty of building a viable business around the virtual currency Bitcoin and the various technological concepts it has introduced to the financial industry, most of all the blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain is the database on which all transactions on the Bitcoin network are recorded. Unlike normal databases, the blockchain is maintained by everyone using the database in a decentralized fashion. That has led many in the financial industry to hail it as a faster — and more reliable — alternative to existing transaction systems.\n\nDigital Asset Holdings is proposing to build something similar to the blockchain database, in order to provide a cheaper and faster way to trade other sorts of financial assets, such as loans and foreign currencies.\n\nThe problem for Ms. Masters is that several other start-ups are trying to do something similar, and there is no guarantee that any of the start-ups will ultimately succeed. Many industry experts think that it could take years to get to the point where the blockchain technology can be used effectively by banks — if it works at all.\n\nThe New York-based start-up ItBit, which is building its own blockchain-like technology, had been out trying to raise $100 million based on the assumption that the company was worth $250 million. More recently, it has scaled that back and is now hoping to get $50 million from investors, with a valuation of $135 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Masters hopes to raise from $35 million to $45 million, valuing the company at $100 million.\n\nDigital Asset Holdings is a relative newcomer to the area. It grew out of a Bitcoin trading operation created by the Chicago trading firm DRW, which operated through a little-known subsidiary of DRW known as Cumberland Mining & Materials.\n\nThe founder of DRW, Don Wilson, helped recruit Ms. Masters, 46, to Digital Asset Holdings this year. Ms. Masters, Oxford-born and Cambridge-educated, had worked at JPMorgan for nearly three decades.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Ms. Masters left JPMorgan in 2014 after a unit in the commodities business she headed was accused of manipulating electricity prices. Ms. Masters was not accused of wrongdoing, and the bank has said that her departure was not tied to the regulatory problems.\n\nSoon after Ms. Masters joined Digital Asset Holdings, known as D.A., this past spring, the company began working with the investment bank Sandler O’Neill to raise money. Within the company, there was an expectation that the fund-raising would be finished by the fall, according to people briefed on the situation.\n\nAt the same time, though, D.A. was trying to figure out its product. Initially, it was looking at creating financial services tied to Bitcoin itself, including a sliver of a Bitcoin that would maintain the value of a dollar. On the wall of the offices there was a screen showing the price of the virtual currency, according to people who were at the offices.\n\nBut not long after Ms. Masters arrived, the Bitcoin chart came down and Digital Asset Holdings began to talk about developing databases similar to the one that Bitcoin had introduced, but not connected to Bitcoin itself.\n\nMs. Masters secured most of the company’s top programming talent by buying smaller start-ups already working in that area, firms with names like Hyperledger, Blockstack and Bits of Proof.\n\nIn recent months, the software that Ms. Masters has shown to potential investors allows for the issuance and trading of so-called syndicated loans — large loans broken into pieces and sold to different investors. It can take weeks for trades in this market to go through, a time span that D.A. is trying to shorten.\n\nInvestors who have looked at the software, though, say they are not convinced that Ms. Masters’s technology will fix the problems in the loan market, which are attributed as much to human cooperation as to bad software.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are also indications that Digital Asset Holdings has not had an easy time integrating all the outside technology start-ups it bought. For example, two of the three employees who worked at Blockstack, which the company acquired in October, have already negotiated to leave D.A., people briefed on the situation said.\n\n“All employees who were offered permanent positions at the time of the acquisitions of Bits of Proof, Hyperledger and Blockstack are still with the company,” said Ms. Shah.\n\nOne of Ms. Masters’s competitors, known as R3, has approached the problem from a different angle and is trying to determine how the banks want to use the blockchain before building specific software. With that strategy, R3 has signed on over 40 banks as partners in recent months, including all of the big banks that Ms. Masters is trying to persuade to invest in her company.\n\nNone of this has scared off JPMorgan, which has agreed to lead the Series A investment round in Digital Asset Holdings, people briefed on the negotiations said. To reward JPMorgan, the people said, D.A. plans to grant it warrants to buy a bigger share of the start-up in the future at the same price it is getting now. JPMorgan is said to have committed to helping Ms. Masters’s company improve and secure adoption of its technology.\n\nSome of the other banks looking into investing in D.A. raised concerns about the JPMorgan deal in a meeting this month at the Sandler O’Neill offices that included Citi, Goldman and Bank of America representatives. Smaller financial companies, like Nasdaq and Markit, have also remained on the fence, the people briefed on the negotiations said."", ""Banks and private industry have gone hog-wild for blockchain technology, now that they understand what all the Bitcoin fuss is about. It only took them six years to catch on. Now, nation-states are catching onto the benefits of the Blockchain, at an even faster pace, starting with Africa’s Tunisia. Tunisia has just agreed to become the first nation to offer its national currency for transmittance through cryptographic technology.\n\nNestled on the northern African coast between Libya to the east and Algeria to the west, south of the Mediterranean Sea and Italy, Tunisia supports over 10 million citizens. Africa has seen many national payment advancements that trump many of the world’s best from Western culture. M-Pesa began the movement in Kenya starting in 2007, changing how business is done as far south as South Africa. BitPesa has brought Bitcoin to thousands of Africans in four countries, and now Monetas has brought the blockchain to Tunisia’s Dinar.\n\n“We believe that mobile financial services are rapidly growing in the region, and Monetas software grants individuals with economic freedom and prosperity through the use of a transaction platform that is magnitudes cheaper than any alternative, interoperable across mobile networks, and can process new financial tools,” says Monetas CEO Johann Gevers to TechMoran.\n\nMonetas may be somewhat analogous to ConsensYs in the Bitcoin space. They just partnered with Microsoft in launching a new cloud-based blockchain platform for large financial institutions to use for experimentation with the new technology. Monetas claims to offer notary public-like protection for this new platform’s transactions, and describes a Bitcoin-like system, save for the mining aspect since the currency is not created internally. Gevers goes on to explain what Tunisian’s can expect from the Monetas system in 2016.\n\n“The Monetas deployment in Tunisia is the first application for a full ecosystem of digital payments. With the La Poste Tunisienne Android application powered by Monetas, Tunisians can use their smartphones to make instant mobile money transfers, pay for goods and services online and in person, send remittance, pay salaries and bills, and manage official government identification documents.”\n\nTunisia already has a form of electronic fiat currency known as the eDinar in use through the Tunisian Post. 90% of the adults in Tunisia with a bank account have one through the Tunisian Post while over 3 million Tunisian adults have no banking relationship. The nation's leaders in government and industry want to improve this, and the partnership with Monetas aims to bring all of the objectives together through the blockchain’s technology. There are over 600k people who will be transitioned to the new system through Tunisian Post shortly, in association with the national government and La Poste Tunisian (LPT).\n\nIt does not seem that Bitcoin has a future within this national system, and in many nations, Bitcoin is neither legal nor illegal. Not being a currency approved or sanctioned by the nation’s central bank or national government does not bode well, at least through Monetas. Gevers says he is working on bringing a similar system to “12 markets”, which may or may not be full nation-states, in 2016, affecting up to 300 million people.\n\nWith countries like Iceland shutting down corrupt naps, putting bankers in jail, and giving the proceeds to its citizens, and major national projects like this. There are reasons to hope for a more inclusive and technologically advanced economic future. At least on a smaller scale, some nations are willing to step into a global leadership role, and not follow the lead of failing economies and systems that have little use in the 21st century, unless the oppression of national debt is your ultimate goal."", ""This is the second article in a three-part series on whether or not Bitcoin makes a good investment. Read the first, detailing 10 arguments in favor, here, and the third, outlining ways to buy, invest in and store Bitcoin, here.\n\nDisclosure: I own a small number of Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2015, venture capitalists poured more money into Bitcoin than ever before, but many such investments were centered around the underlying technology, called the blockchain. Meanwhile, the currency languished in the $200-$300 range for most of the year (after hitting highs north of $1,000 in late 2013), but in the last few months, Bitcoin has not only risen but broken through the $400 barrier in the last couple weeks and stayed there.\n\nIn the first installment of this series, I explored 10 reasons why Bitcoin could make a good investment, ranging from growing transaction volume to the possibility that Bitcoin is undervalued when compared to similar stores of value, so there’s a possibility that an investment in Bitcoin could pay off handsomely one day (at least as of December 2015 — I expect the outlook to change over time). By one estimate, one Bitcoin could be worth more than $17,000 by 2025.\n\nHowever, it’s early days for this digital currency, and any number of events could cause the value to decline, if not plummet or even hit zero. Wences Casares, founder and CEO of Bitcoin company Xapo, said in a recent interview on The Chain by investor video network RealVision, “I assume that there’s a 20% chance that Bitcoin fails towards zero. I assume that there is a 50% or slightly higher than 50% chance that Bitcoin succeeds in being mainstream in the digital world, in which case, there will be as many users as there are of Whatsapp today, and to do that, you need Bitcoin to be worth $1 million per Bitcoin. And that’s 2,000 times what it’s worth today. And there is about a 30% chance that Bitcoin succeeds in some niche use case where it doesn’t disappear, but it’s not broadly used, and therefore the price is not $0 and it’s not $1 million.”\n\nBecause of what he calls the “nontrivial chance” that Bitcoin fails, any amount you place in the currency or a representative investment vehicle should be a sum that you are completely willing to lose. In this installment of my series on whether or not Bitcoin makes a good investment, I will explore 10 threats to the future value of the currency.\n\n1. The parameters of the currency could be changed.\n\nOne of the main drivers of speculative investment in Bitcoin is the fact that the number of bitcoins will be limited to 21 million. That is heightened further by the fact that the number of new bitcoins released by the system will be halved every four years. In July, that reward is expected to decrease from 25 to 12.5. (A block reward is released roughly every 10 minutes.)\n\nA couple times, prominent people in the Bitcoin community have mentioned removing this cap. Jon Matonis, a former executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, said he believed it was an inevitable question. Ryan Selkis, director of growth and investments at Digital Currency Group, suggested separately last summer that this may become a viable alternative to halving the block reward periodically. In a series of tweets and a Medium post, Selkis said the community might instead agree to a 1% to 2% inflation rate of the monetary base. Removing the cap could solve for two problems. One is that, so far, wealth in Bitcoin is concentrated in a few hands. Removing the cap could help dilute their share. The other potential problem is that someday, payments to the miners (the people and companies running the computers that maintain the system) may not be sufficient enough to cover their costs. Payments consist of both the block reward and transaction fees. As the block reward decreases, if transaction fees do not increase enough, that puts the whole system’s security at risk, because fewer miners would find mining profitable enough to continue, thereby centralizing the system and making it more vulnerable to attack.\n\nHowever, Selkis maintains that removing the cap and deciding upon a 1% to 2% inflation rate in the monetary supply would help fuel even more interest in Bitcoin, allowing it to grow even more than it would with the cap. So even then, it’s not clear that removing the cap would lower the value of the currency.\n\n2. There could be an attack on the network.\n\nOne of the core features of Bitcoin is the fact that it is a decentralized system; its security comes from the fact that it is maintained by many different entities all over the world. If it becomes more centralized, that creates opportunities for a single bad actor (or consortium of bad actors) or a weak link to undermine the system.\n\nA 51% attack is one in which a miner, or group of miners acting in concert (such as 51 attackers with 1% each of the network power), gains control of more than half of the Bitcoin network’s computing power, enabling them to “spend” money more than once or prevent transactions from going through — and that would undermine faith in the currency. On the one hand, the risk is greater than it seems because theoretically, the bad actor wouldn’t even need to actually gain control of 51% of the network. On the other hand, it seems an attacker would be limited in the types of damage they could inflict — such an attacker would not, for instance, be able to reverse other people’s transactions or change the number of coins generated per block or create new coins. But regardless, having one miner control such a large percentage of the network could scare enough people that it would affect the value of the currency. A couple times, one miner, Ghash.io, did come dangerously close to having 51% of the network power, but it promised never to mount a 51% attack against the network. However, getting powerful miners to vow not to attack is not a reliable solution for the problem of 51% attacks in general.\n\nChris Burniske of ARK Investment Management, the first public fund manager to invest in Bitcoin, says that the chances that a 51% attack succeeds and is profitable are low. As of August 2015, he predicts an attacker would not only have to invest up to $400 million into infrastructure in order to perpetrate such an attack, but then also be able to sustain the attack for several weeks in order to profit from it. Even then, once the attacker gained this power, they may not profit much from it if the value of the currency then implodes.\n\nHowever, Dave Hudson, vice president of software architecture at enterprise distributed ledger technology company Peernova who also blogs at Hashingit.com, points out that even if such an attack were uncovered and then the currency’s value dropped, the attackers could still profit “if they had the ability to take a very, very good short position against Bitcoin.”\n\nAn attacker could also be incentivized to do so if other assets are layered on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, and the value of assets on the chain becomes more valuable than the cost of attacking it. (Some companies considered putting other assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, using, say, one-millionth of a Bitcoin to represent $1 million of Apple stock, via so-called “colored coins,” but it appears that many companies are moving away from this method.)\n\n3. Transaction volume moves off the Bitcoin blockchain into side chains or permissioned chains.\n\nOne of the current reasons for optimism about the currency is the fact that transaction volume on the Bitcoin blockchain is increasing. However, some developments could move at least some of that transaction volume off the main Bitcoin blockchain into so-called side chains, in which many transactions (of Bitcoin or other assets) are tracked on a separate blockchain maintained not by anonymous miners but by a group of entities who agree to run it, and then batched into one transaction that is validated periodically on the main Bitcoin blockchain. So instead of all of these transactions occurring individually on the Bitcoin blockchain, they would be condensed, decreasing the number of actual transactions placed there.\n\nBurniske admits putting transactions on side chains “will slow the price appreciation somewhat. Maybe [Bitcoin’s value] wouldn't get as high as the price would be if you didn't have a private chain,” but he still says, “I still think the demand is going to be so high [for the batched validating transactions] that you're going to have price hikes of multiples into the present day.”\n\n4. The system does not successfully transition from being subsidized by the block reward to being paid for by transaction fees.\n\nCurrently, the vast majority of payments to miners consists of block rewards — in 2014, 99.7% of their revenue was from block rewards and only 0.3% was in transaction fees. While it seems that transaction fees would have to increase by 330 times in order to replace the block reward, Burniske argues that the current size of the block reward has caused miners to over-invest in infrastructure especially in relation to Bitcoin’s current market capitalization. In “Bitcoin: Securing the Network,” Burniske predicts mining will eventually become less capital-intensive and miners will eventually accept lower margins.\n\nOne risk is that, as the decreasing block reward shrinks miners’ profits, the number of miners could drop, causing more centralization of the network and leaving it more susceptible to a 51% attack. But he calculates that transaction fees of 1.2% (in the absence of block rewards) would sufficiently incentivize enough miners to maintain the network and keep it safe from a 51% attack.\n\n5. The Chinese firewall or another Internet issue causes the global Bitcoin network to be split for a few days.\n\n“The Chinese have a fantastically large firewall that they can use to block Internet traffic,” says Hudson. If the firewall caused the Chinese miners to be disconnected from the global Bitcoin network for a few days, during that time, the Chinese miners would still continue to mine the transactions taking place within China, while the rest of the network would be mining a totally different set of transactions. “Realistically, that would look like a fairly irreconcilable fork,” says Hudson. “There’s no mechanism to bring them back together again short of one winning and the other losing completely.”\n\nIn general, the system only works well as long as the vast majority of the mining hardware is online and a large percentage of the miners follow the same set of rules. So basic Internet connectivity issues and “forks” that occur when different miners run different versions of the software could also cause a drop in the value of the currency.\n\n6. The lack of a central authority prevents the protocol from progressing.\n\n“Bitcoin has this one thing which is both a blessing and a major hindrance to it as a technology,” says Hudson — and that is its decentralized nature. “The fact that it’s decentralized has allowed it to develop, but it also means when problems happen, it’s hard to see how they’ll be resolved,” he says.\n\nJonathan Levin, cofounder of Chainalysis, a Bitcoin compliance company, says that this leads to some inertia, even around uncontroversial changes. “It [took] ages to get all the miners to upgrade their software to protect themselves against transaction malleability [which made it possible for people to perpetrate fraudulent transactions]. You need human consensus, to distribute software all over the world, to go through what has to be a rigorous governance process to get these changes made and you’ve got tons of people using the Bitcoin network and making sure that the changes are a value add for everyone.”\n\nThe challenge that governance poses for Bitcoin was evident in 2015, when one question roiled and divided the community: how should the network capacity be increased to accommodate more transactions? Currently, each block of transactions, which gets processed every 10 minutes, can contain up to 1MB of data, which allows it to process seven transactions a second. (In contrast, Visa’s network is capable of processing 65,000 transactions per second.) Blocks need some sort of limit because otherwise, the network would be flooded by spam transactions, but the Bitcoin community — which consists of actors with roles as varied as miners, core developers, full-node operators (who propagate the transactions to be placed into the next block), Bitcoin companies as well as others — has been divided over whether another method could be used to increase the number of transactions processed on the network, or, if the block size is increased, how to increase it and what size would be appropriate.\n\nWhether this one debate gets resolved — and if it does, how — could give a glimpse as to whether the currency will be able to resolve problems in the future. While it hasn’t been very promising so far — “There’s been lots of fighting and very little progress,” says Hudson — if the community not only settles the block size debate but then also comes up with a process for dealing with future questions, that would bode well for the continued growth (and therefore increase in value) of the currency. However, it’s not yet clear whether or not the larger question of governance will be worked out or if only the narrower question of the block size will.\n\n“Open source is extraordinarily good at replicating on the existing design pattern, where everybody can see what it is that they’re supposed to be building,” says Hudson. “[Such projects] tend to stall more when they have to do something new, and especially in this case, where lots of participants have a vested financial interest in the outcome of what’s done, there doesn’t seem to be a good approach being taken by almost any of the participants.”\n\nFor instance, he says that a good engineering practice would be to build simulations of the system that would allow the developers to change various parameters to see how it would affect the network.\n\n“Unfortunately, the things that’s very surprising is that nobody seems to have stepped up to make that happen,” he says. “The core team seem to have spent far, far more more time arguing about how they’d like things to work rather than actually trying to find a framework that everybody could actually do their work within, to try running what-if scenarios … It is very disappointing from my perspective that there is no concerted effort to try to resolve this by doing things that would be considered good engineering practice anywhere else.”\n\nSo far, he says, when there have been minor forks of the software, “that’s generally been resolved by people having to get in touch with some of the mining consortiums, some of the larger ones, and basically saying, please put this back the way we want it.” However, no process has been established for preventing or dealing with such issues in the future.\n\n7. A competing protocol could overtake it.\n\nThe emergence of Bitcoin and other digital currencies is certain to move society into a digital asset future. But the question is whether the Bitcoin blockchain, out of all the virtual currencies and similar protocols, will conduct all or a significant portion of these transactions. After all, there currently almost 700 other digital currencies, and surely more to be created. Because it’s so early, and for several of the reasons laid out above, in particular governance issues, there’s a possibility that Bitcoin could go the way of MySpace or AOL and that another protocol overtakes it.\n\nAs I wrote in the first installment of this series, Stephen Pair, CEO of Bitcoin merchant processor BitPay, said, “For us to change to [another digital currency], it would first have to overcome Bitcoin’s security and liquidity properties and then we would probably switch from Bitcoin into only that alternative — because there would no longer be a reason to accept Bitcoin.” Because the value of the currency and network is only realized the more others use it, if people begin to perceive that another network is better than Bitcoin — either because of its technical capabilities or because it is not stymied by governance issues — that could sap the value of the currency.\n\nSome contenders for protocols that pose a threat to Bitcoin include Ethereum, which has more technical capabilities than Bitcoin and a currency called ether; Ripple, another protocol focused on international payments with a currency, XRP; and new protocols being developed by the technology and financial industries, such as the Open Ledger Project overseen by the Linux Foundation, with participation from IBM, Cisco, Intel, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo, Accenture and others. The last of these is particularly interesting because it is open source like Bitcoin, but could also resolve some of the governance issues that Bitcoin has faced.\n\n8. World events prompt a crackdown.\n\n“There’s a lot of public policy debate around encryption, surveillance powers, around counterterrorism measures,” says Levin. “The debate can change based on events.” Referencing the attacks in Paris and questions over whether Daesh had used digital currencies, he says, “if governments feel that by not having control over this, they are facilitating very bad social issues, like terrorism, that would be a major problem. Right now, I think governments feel that Bitcoin itself is far too small to really pose a threat to any nation-state. It provides a lot of interesting innovation in financial services, a lot of inspiration for new types of financial arrangements, and so Bitcoin continues.”\n\nHowever, a recent report by the Rand Corporation, “National Security Implications of Virtual Currency,” said that such groups are more likely to start their own virtual currencies than use an existing one: “The use of an established virtual currency, such as Bitcoin, as a currency by a non-state actor would provide few political or economic advantages and would likely be vulnerable to cyber attack by a sophisticated adversary, while facing many of the same implementation challenges as a new virtual currency.”\n\n9. Government regulations in one part of the world put the whole network at risk.\n\n“There are ways for governments to make it incredibly difficult or painful for people to hold Bitcoin,” says Levin. “There could be capital controls that could make it very difficult for Bitcoin to take off. I wouldn’t say that those tides are there at the moment. I think that there are very strong attitudes by regulators that this is the march of innovation, they want to permit this to go on, but I think that there is a scenario in which the government says, actually, party’s over.”\n\nThis could also affect the network, says Hudson. “More than 50% of mining is currently happening in China, which obviously leads to a systemic risk if the government in China decides that they want to regulate Bitcoin in some way.” He says that this is the one of the reasons that some companies are concerned about using the Bitcoin blockchain — “because you can have a government or regulation coming in in one place where it significantly affects the network’s characteristics and capabilities.”\n\n10. People get burned by it as an investment.\n\nBitcoin has proven to be a volatile investment. However, what makes it even more volatile to a Western investor than it might have been is the fact that investors from other cultures may have different approaches to investing that make it behave even more unpredictably. In particular, the approach to investing in China is more similar to gambling than it is in the West. Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, an exchange based in Shanghai, says that this has already influenced the volatility of the price. “Chinese people are very — greedy is one word. I think opportunistic is a better word. They’re very opportunistic. If they think this is going to go up, they’re going to go in and scoop up every last penny off the ground, as compared to Westerners might think, eh, that’s not good enough an investment. It’s too bothersome, I won’t bend over and pick up the coins.” He says that twice, he has seen this behavior influence the price: “When there’s a perception that Bitcoin is about to break out, the perception is a self-fulfilling fantasy that causes the breakout.” He says that this was one cause behind the dramatic rise in price over a few days in early November during which volume on the exchanges in China exceeded those in other parts of the world.\n\nBarry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, which has invested in 55 virtual currency companies, only expects it to get more volatile for several reasons, starting with the fact that the exchange market is quite fragmented and spread out over about a dozen exchanges. “If you want to buy or sell $5 million to $10 million of Bitcoin, that is going to result in the price likely moving up or down 10%. If all of the exchanges were connected, or if there was one central exchange and one big order book, you could buy and sell $5 million or $10 million and it wouldn’t affect the price much,” he says. “And of course, all the exchanges tends to move in tandem. So if someone sells $5 million of Bitcoin on a Chinese exchange, … you will likely see all the exchanges move down in tandem.” Additionally, he says volatility is high because there’s not yet a developed derivatives market.\n\nCasares of Xapo said in the RealVision interview that he believes the price could drop if people begin putting money that they cannot afford to lose into the currency and then the price falls. “If at some point, people begin to feel that this is a sure thing, it goes up 1% every week no matter what, and people begin to mortgage their homes to buy Bitcoin, or put their kid’s college fund here or their retirement funds here, money that they cannot afford to lose — if at any point, people put money that they cannot afford to lose into Bitcoin, it’s very easy to see how, when the price goes down, people have to sell because they cannot afford to lose more … So you can imagine the panic that drives it to zero.”\n\nThe reason, he says, is that Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value: “It’s what the market collectively says it is worth.” He says even if the value does not go to zero, it could end up at something like $15 but never regain the public’s trust.\n\n“So that’s what I’m most concerned with,” he says. “So while Bitcoin remains very volatile, I’m happy because I think volatility is my friend, because volatility is the only one I can thank for the money in Bitcoin being money that people can afford to lose. The moment I see volatility slow down, I get worried, because I can imagine silly money going into Bitcoin and risking its fate.”\n\nSo, if the first article in this series had you convinced it was time to invest in Bitcoin, now you know at least some of the ways your investment could go wrong.

Now, a handful of Bitcoin’s core developers have reportedly left the project to start a new digital currency.\n\nIn a press release, the group and makers of the widely used btcsuite announced they are building Decred, an alternative digital currency. Decred developer Christina Jepson said their goal is to address the issues of governance and development funding that Bitcoin faces today.\n\n“The intention is not to attack what we currently have in Bitcoin, we want to recognize what has been done well, but instead we want to take that and improve on what we think can be done better,” Jepson said in a statement. “Alternatives are progress and a way forward to improve the greater ecosystem.”\n\nThe group formed a new company, Company 0 LLC, which it said will have the sole command of the direction the currency takes. The developers said the new company will limit the outside input in how the currency will be governed.\n\n“The Bitcoin software is controlled by a small group of people who decide exclusively what can and cannot be changed,” said Company 0 CEO Jacob Yocom-Piatt. “This is in part due to a lack of mechanisms and pathways for funding development work directly from the community, and as a result Bitcoin development is funded by external entities that create conflicts of interest between the developers and the representative power of the community that uses Bitcoin. We want to change that.”\n\nYocom-Piatt said Decred’s goal is to remove the Dark Side from Bitcoin’s management, leaving only the good parts.\n\nSingapore develops blockchain-based app for banking, financial sector\n\nSpeaking of the good parts, Singapore is putting Bitcoin’s blockchain model to good use.\n\nNewsbtc reported the country’s Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), DBS Bank and Standard Chartered Bank developed the first blockchain technology-based application for the banking and financial sector.\n\nStill in the proof of concept stage, the app will allow banks to digitize the invoices and upload them to a blockchain-based decentralized ledger, which, in turn, will act as a common repository that can be accessed by all participating banks.\n\n“Leveraging distributed ledger technology, the initiative will reduce risk around duplicate invoice financing for banks while preserving client confidentiality,” IDA said in a statement.\n\nCoinbase website down after DDoS attack\n\nMeanwhile, here’s a lesson in security for developers and bitcoin exchange operators.\n\nBitcoin wallet and exchange company Coinbase went offline over the weekend following a denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. According to TechWorm, two hackers–@L7Crew and @An0CBR—claimed to have brought down Coinbase’s main website.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company has three core products: an exchange for bitcoin and fiat currencies, a wallet for bitcoin storage and transactions, and an API for developers and merchants. Coinbase’s exchange operates in 32 countries, while the wallet works in 190 countries.\n\nComments', 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'Since the beginning of 2015, a growing number of financial establishments and banking groups have adopted the Bitcoin blockchain technology to create decentralized financial applications and platforms.\n\nMulti-billion dollar banks have been conducting collaborative research and co-developing blockchain-based experimental applications to explore the potential and technical advantages of the distributed ledger technology in the finance sector.\n\nVisa Europe, a membership association and cooperative of over 3,700 European banks and alternative payment services providers which operate Visa branded products further emphasized that 2015 has turned the blockchain technology into a vital technology which the industry cannot live without.\n\n“It is no longer a choice anymore. Recent news speculating about the identity of its creator and the formalisation of virtual money as a commodity, just makes it more real than ever before,” said the organization.\n\nThe blockchain technology and its decentralized and transparent nature has significant advantage over existing financial and remittance applications. It is secured by an unprecedented level of computing power generated by millions of miners in the network settling and clearing transactions.\n\nSuch feature of the blockchain technology enables anyone in the network to send payments instantaneously, with extremely low fees. Due to the Bitcoin blockchain network’s low transaction fees, an increasing number of remittance startups have begun to offer bitcoin-based international payment services.\n\nAccording to Visa Europe, traditional fintech and remittance startups including TransferWise have achieved billion dollar valuations and attracted prominent venture capital firms and angel investors into the industry. However, the organization predicts that the blockchain technology will disrupt the existing remittance industry with a more efficient and secure solution.\n\n“The challenges for blockchain and bitcoin in the year ahead will be two-fold. Proponents will have to further address the lack of trust, a challenge they’ve faced since their creation. Then, the challenge of turning these technologies to tackle more real-world scenarios, such as sending money overseas,” Visa Europe explained.\n\nToday, remittance outlets settle around US$600 million a month on average. TransferWise for example, settle around US$700 million every month while saving over US$32 million in the process.\n\n“Exceeding the £500m a month milestone is important as it shows a fundamental shift in people’s awareness of how banks, brokers and others take advantage of customers by hiding the real cost of international transactions,” explained TransferWise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus.\n\n“We transfer tens of millions of customer money everyday and we have approximately two per cent UK market share of the international money transfer business. This figure is only going to grow as customers become fed up with the traditional banking sector and look for fairer alternatives like TransferWise,” he continued.\n\nWhile TransferWise has successfully developed a cheaper alternative to current banking solutions, its costs are still much higher than decentralized and peer to peer payment networks.\n\nOver the next few years, VISA Europe and world’s leading banking groups expect bitcoin to outperform existing remittance outlets and payment giants including Western Union and TransferWise.\n\nIn 2016, the daily transaction volume of bitcoin is expected to surpass Paypal and American credit card networks including Discover.\n\nAccording to the data chart provided by Coinometrics, the transaction volume of Discover (PULSE network) and Paypal currently stands at around US$400 million.\n\nHowever, with bitcoin’s rising trend and the growing interest from banks and financial establishments, bitcoin and financial experts predict bitcoin to surpass the volumes of prominent financial establishments soon.', ""Not a week went by in 2015 without a major data breach, significant attack campaign, or serious vulnerability report. Many of the incidents were the result of disabled security controls, implementation errors, or other basic security mistakes, highlighting how far organizations have to go in nailing down IT security basics.\n\nBut looking beyond the garden-variety attacks and vulnerabilities lends great insight into the future of malicious activity and how to defend against it. And 2015 had its share of intriguing invasions, each of which highlighted the modified techniques that lead to new forms of breaches or pinpoint areas in need of new defenses. The past year saw cyber criminals adopting innovative approaches and state-sponsored actors becoming bolder. Motivations shifted, with financial gain no longer the sole reason for launching an attack. Inflicting physical damage, stealing trade secrets, hacking as a form of protest -- 2015 was a year in which malicious activity served many ends.\n\nThe increasingly interconnected world means bad guys can cause a lot of damage; more important, many malicious actors now have the skills and means to carry out chilling attacks. Below is a roundup of some of the most significant incidents of the past year, each of which pushes the overall security conversation further, showing new paths and needs for defense. Which ones did we miss?\n\nBitcoin under barrage\n\nBitcoin -- and the idea of crypto currency in general -- captured mainstream attention this year, in part because of nefarious actors who used the platform as cover for payment. Ransomware gangs have demanded payment in bitcoins before unlocking victims’ files and folders, and blackmailers have demanded bitcoins in exchange for not launching DDoS attacks against websites. But bitcoin made security headlines several times in 2015 for a different reason: Thieves kept stealing bitcoins ... lots of them.\n\nEuropean exchange Bitstamp suspended trading after discovering one of its operational bitcoin storage wallets was compromised in early January. The exchange is believed to be the world’s third busiest and handles approximately 6 percent of all bitcoin transactions. About 19,000 bitcoins, or roughly $5 million, were stolen at the time. That wasn’t the only bitcoin attack, as China-based exchange BTER reported in February that 7,170 bitcoins, or roughly $1.75 million, were stolen from its cold wallet system. Thieves stole 10.235 BTC, or roughly $2,500, from bitcoin startup Purse in October.\n\nConsider it a twist on the traditional bank heist: Instead of looting bank accounts, exchanges are raided. In addition to showing there is real financial value associated with the virtual currency, the thefts highlighted the need “for an internationally recognized security standard” for bitcoin, said Florindo Gallicchio, director of information security in the Optiv Office of the CISO. In February, the Cryptocurrency Certification Consortium (C4) proposed 10 standardized rules for the creation, storage, audit, and use of bitcoins, as part of the Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS).\n\nWhile the amounts stolen aren’t insignificant, they pale in comparison to the 850,000 bitcoins, worth close to $450 million, that disappeared from Japanese-based exchange Mt. Gox in 2014. The exchange, believed to have handled 70 percent of all bitcoins, has since closed and entered bankruptcy. Japanese police believe the theft was an inside job.\n\nAs is often the case with technology, the exchanges have thus far focused on functionality and usability, with security an afterthought, said Steve Donald, CTO of Hexis Cyber Solutions. Many of the attacks relied on social engineering to gain a foothold on to the exchange’s network. Exchanges need to adopt secure code development practices, as well as dynamic and static code analysis to protect their applications. “Bitcoin exchanges should be highly incented to improve security as this will be a requirement before this new type of currency will achieve wide scale usage,” Donald said.\n\nCyber goes real-world\n\nCyber attacks that result in damage in the physical world happen far more often on TV shows than they do off-screen. It was scary when the Shamoon malware attack partially wiped or totally destroyed hard drives of 35,000 computers at Saudi oil company Aramco back in 2012. We saw the blurring between cyber and physical again -- to be fair, the attack actually happened in 2014 and the report providing the details were released shortly before the end of the year -- at an unnamed German steel mill when attackers manipulated and disrupted control systems. The blast furnace could not be properly shut down, resulting in “massive” damages, according to reports.\n\nThere is a tendency to think cyber attacks are about stealing data or knocking systems offline. There can be real-world damage, too. An attacker can potentially compromise a pharmaceutical company’s production process or quality control systems and modify the recipe for a particular drug. Hospital systems are also vulnerable to attack, especially since many legacy systems still in use cannot be secured. As much as 20 percent of hospitals are vulnerable to attacks that can disable critical care systems, Gallicchio said.\n\n“People can be physically hurt from a cyber attack,” Gallicchio said.\n\nIndustrial control system security comes up a lot in conversation, but the incident at the German steel mill highlights the fact that the threat is no longer theoretical. One of the challenges facing industrial control system security, especially in manufacturing, is the simple fact that the systems are typically controlled and administered by operations and engineering departments, not IT. The operations and engineering teams are focused on reliability and make decisions at the expense of security in order to maintain uptime.\n\nImproving defenses requires “a mix of basics and more contemporary defenses,” such as ensuring proper segmentation and access controls between different networks, Donald said.\n\nFinancial crime goes big\n\nThere were a number of attacks against financial institutions in 2015, but none was more audacious than the Carbanak crime ring, which targeted more than 100 banks and other financial institutions in 30 nations. Kaspersky Lab estimated the gang had stolen as much as $1 billion since late 2013 and had managed to stay under the radar for two years because it kept each transaction between $2.5 million and $10 million.\n\nThe scale of attacks against financial institutions indicate criminals are moving away from low-value consumer-related attacks such as identity and credit card theft in favor of high-value attacks. “The old ‘smash and grab’ jobs are becoming carefully orchestrated and executed jobs,” said Mike Davis, CTO of CounterTack.\n\nThe FBI also warned of an increase in social engineering campaigns where an attacker sends an email purporting to be from the CEO or another senior executive to the CFO or another executive authorizing a wire transfer. If the recipient is tricked and doesn’t validate the email’s authenticity before the transfer, that money is gone, usually for good.\n\nWhile external attackers still pose the biggest threat to financial organizations, 2015 showed insiders can cause damage as well. Earlier this year, a former employee of Morgan Stanley pleaded guilty to stealing confidential data from more than 700,000 customer accounts while he was interviewing for a new job with two competitors. And external attackers target insiders who already have access to sensitive data. Encryption, dynamic security policies that travel with data, and robust multifactor authentication controls are some of the defenses financial institutions should consider to ensure that unauthorized individuals can’t read anything they shouldn’t be allowed to see, said Ron Arden, vice-president of Fasoo.\n\nHealth care on the breach radar\n\nSome of the biggest breaches in 2015 involved health care organizations, including Anthem, Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, Premera Blue Cross, and CareFirst, to name a few. Eight of the 10 largest health care breaches happened in 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIt’s no surprise the attackers went after health care, since the companies tend to have valuable data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, medical records, and financial information. The data is difficult to change, meaning it has a longer shelf life and can be used in a variety of follow-up attacks. Attackers accessed more than 100 million health care records in 2015.\n\nWhile some of the breaches may have been part of identity theft and other cyber crime activities, security experts believe Anthem was the work of Chinese state-actors. The attackers may have been after data on specific individuals for intelligence purposes, or they may have wanted intellectual property relating to how medical coverage and insurer databases are set up. The Chinese government has denied any involvement in the attacks, and Chinese authorities recently arrested individuals they claim had targeted Anthem for cyber crime purposes.\n\n“Just like how the financial verticals evolved to the next-generation bank heists, we will soon see attackers use health care information records to support more sophisticated business models,” said Itzik Kotler, co-founder and CTO at SafeBreach.\n\nThese attacks were successful in large part because health care companies have not traditionally invested as much on security initiatives as financial institutions have. The Anthem breach, in particular, showed how far some health care companies lag on basic security best practices. As Target shook the retail sector out of its complacency in 2014, Anthem made the health care industry sit up and notice the very real dangers it faces.\n\nWorse, encryption practices around sensitive data had no effect. In many health care breaches, users were socially engineered out of their credentials, letting attackers easily bypass encryption controls. It doesn’t take a lot, either. Attackers stole 80 million personal records from a large health care insurance company by compromising only five user accounts, Eric Tilenius, CEO of BlueTalon, said. “Every company should ask, ‘How much data would be exposed if a user account gets compromised?’ and then work to limit that exposure,” he said.\n\n“It doesn’t matter how strong your security platform is, if employees aren’t properly trained in best security practices, it all can go out the window,” said Garry McCracken, vice president of technology at WinMagic.\n\nAttacks as part of a long game\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing, significant, and shocking security incident of 2015 was the attack against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The personal data of millions of government employees, U.S. military personnel, and government contractors who had received background checks and security clearances were stolen. In a typical data breach, the attackers target the organization because they want the information it has. In the case of OPM, the attackers didn’t want the records simply for the sake of having them, but to obtain background information on targeted individuals.\n\n“[The OPM breach] represents human targeting at its finest, understanding that people are our biggest security risk … our weakest link in the chain,” said Renee Bradshaw, manager of solutions strategy at NetIQ, the security portfolio of Micro Focus.\n\nThe method of attack followed a formula: Target a subcontractor in a social engineering attack and steal credentials to gain access to the network. Plant malware on a system and create a backdoor. Exfiltrate data for months, undetected. The level of poor security practices at OPM “was astounding,” including lack of consistent vulnerability scanning and two-factor authentication, as well as untimely patch management, said Bradshaw.\n\nThe OPM breach also emphasized organizations' vulnerability to social engineering. Government employees and contractors are now subject to security awareness training programs to learn about the dangers of spear phishing and other social media threats.\n\nVulnerabilities out of control\n\nThe attack against Hacking Team over the summer was an eye-opener. The Milan-based company developed and sold surveillance software to government agencies around the world. The company relied on zero-day vulnerabilities to develop software that was difficult to detect and could intercept communications. When an unknown individual released more than 400GB of data stolen from Hacking Team, including email communications, business documents, and source code, security researchers uncovered proofs-of-concept for three different zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. While Adobe scrambled to fix the flaws as quickly as possible, cyber criminals were able to create exploits and use them in large-scale attacks.\n\n“Hoarding zero-day exploits at both the national and private level is dangerous for everyone. We can’t expect to come out on top if we are sitting on these types of vulnerabilities,” said Tom Gorup, security operations leader at security consulting firm Rook Security."", 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', ""Segregated Witness, the proposal put forth by Blockstream developer Dr. Pieter Wuille, has been trumpeted as a block size scaling solution that gets around the difficult scenarios associated with increasing the block size utilizing a hard fork.\n\nBut the problem is that, while Segregated Witness does provide benefit to the code, it misses one of the fundamental problems bitcoin has been experiencing: there are no true, long-term solutions on how to scale Bitcoin for mass-adoption. Instead, the focus has been on developing solutions on top of bitcoin. Further, the stigma associated with a hard fork acts as a hindrance to further development.\n\nSegregated Witness 101\n\nWhen looking at the block size problem, it helps to think of it as a bucket of marbles. The 1MB block size can carry a certain number of transactions the same as a bucket can only carry so many marbles. As more transactions try to fit in the block, naturally some are unable; they fall out.\n\nWhat Segregated Witness does is remove the signature from the transaction and stores it in a separate data structure. By removing the signature from the transaction, the size of the that transaction decreases.\n\nIn his blog post about Segreated Witness, Gavin Andresen said:\n\nfor example, the simplest possible one-input, one-output segregated witness transaction would be about 90 bytes of transaction data plus 80 or so bytes of signature—only those 90 bytes need to squeeze into the one megabyte block, instead of 170 bytes. More complicated multi-signature transactions save even more.”\n\nUsing our marble analogy, in this most basic of examples, each marble is shrunk down by approximately 47%. In essence, we find that we can have 47% more one-to-one transactions in the block size.\n\nBut at its core, Segregated Witness is compression and optimization of the code; it’s not a true scaling feature. There remains only 1MB of block space and when that fills, the problems that the network are currently experiencing come back again.\n\nThe Hard Fork Stigma\n\nBitcoin is at a crossroads right now. On one hand, there is a significant push to keep the blocksize at the arbitrary 1MB size—there has been no data presented suggesting this is the optimal size. And on the other hand, there is the need to prove that bitcoin can be scaled to a point where it can handle transactions from a growing user base.\n\nThe problem has to do with a stigma associated with implementing a change via a hard fork.\n\nThe concern with a hard fork is that it results in two parallel chains where the winner takes all and the losers are harmed. It can result in double spends and uncertainty as to which chain is going to win. When dealing with a market cap of over $6 billion, concern about that is certainly warranted.\n\nBut the problem is that inaction—or a decision not to act—results in the same outcome. The inability for the community to get behind a hard fork to scale bitcoin even to 2MB, as proposed by Jeff Garzik in BIP 102, can create an event as chaotic as a hard fork.\n\nIn an email to the Bitcoin Core Dev team, Garzik postulated that by not scaling bitcoin and instead pushing for higher transaction fees, it would create an economic change event, which “is a period of market chaos, where large changes to prices and sets of economic actors occurs over a short time period.”\n\nBoth are problematic and can cause significant damage to the community. However, what a proposal like BIP 102 does is get past the stigma of a hard fork and allow the developers to do what they’re good at: analyze data and make decisions based on it.\n\nThere is no doubt that there is a need to scale bitcoin. While Segregated Witness is, fundamentally, a great move, it doesn’t solve the problem that there is a stigma associated with hard forking the code, which will be an inevitable necessity to further scale the protocol.\n\nSegregated Witness Should Hard Fork\n\nIn a series of Tweets, BitGo Engineer Jameson Lopp argued that node operators have a responsibility to keep current with software that is responsible for securing people’s money. In essence, if you’re going to run a node that is securing the Bitcoin network, which inherently is securing people’s money, the tech needs to be upgraded.\n\n1) If you administer a computer that is used to secure people's money, you have responsibility to keep it running like a well-oiled machine. — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 23, 2015\n\nTo offer the necessary data that developers need, Segregated Witness should be pushed through as a hard fork, where those that do not upgrade are left behind. Segregated Witness is not controversial; it’s exactly what Bitcoin needs. Therefore, it would show what a hard fork is like and shake out some of the nodes that are not going to update their software.\n\nThere’s no doubt that scaling Bitcoin is a difficult conversation; however, it is going to continue coming up. Even with Segregated Witness, the network will reach a point where it needs to scale again. Compressing data can only work so much. At some point, you can’t make the marbles any smaller and you have to go find a bigger bucket."", 'Plutus, a London-based startup, is developing a mobile app that will permit users to buy goods with bitcoin at any store in the world that accepts NFC-based contactless payments\n\nUsers send bitcoins to an address displayed on the “Tap & Pay” app and get the equivalent in fiat on a prepaid virtual debit card that can be used to make NFC payments. The Plutus app also rewards users with a proprietary virtual currency, called Plutons, for using the app.\n\nDanial Daychopan, Plutus CEO & Co-Founder, commented:\n\nThe intent of the app is to be practical. Plutus plugs into existing infrastructure to allow contactless payments which reward you on the the blockchain. It’s simply a stepping stone towards adoption and a practical use-case that many have been asking for.\n\nThe app utilizes smart contracts generated on the Ethereum blockchain platform to effect payment, and rewards users with Plutons, a digital currency issued on the same blockchain.\n\nThe company highlights five steps how to make payments through the app:\n\nYou send bitcoins to an address displayed on the Plutus app. The bitcoins are forwarded automatically to verified traders on the decentralized exchange in exchange for an offer in USD, EUR, etc. The smart contact (DEX) running on the Ethereum platform recognizes that the traders have received your bitcoins, and their equivalent fiat deposit is released to your Plutus debit card balance automatically. You can now use your Plutus balance to pay at any NFC terminal in the world. The merchant always receives payment in their preferred currency through the global debit card network.\n\nThe app essentially uses Plutons as a rebate for using the Plutus app, which also can be converted to spend at any NFC-enabled store in the same way as bitcoins.\n\nThe startup says Plutons have zero fees and free conversion to fiat.\n\nWith a launch planned for 2016, Plutus believes that the app will permit any NFC terminal globally to be used as a bitcoin payment terminal.\n\nPlutus was founded by a team with experience in banking, financial markets and blockchain technology. The management conducted a case study on expanding the use of bitcoin through the global NFC infrastructure, which concluded that in 2016 there will globally be more than a billion NFC enabled handsets, 166 million NFC users, and 43 million base of NFC points of sale.']"
12/29/2015,"['After a year filled with its share of doom and gloom, the verdict is in: Bitcoin won 2015.\n\nAs trumpeted by headlines in CNBC and Bloomberg, bitcoin was the best-performing currency of the year, netting near-40% gains, more than double its nearest competition, the Somali Shilling and Gambian Dalasi. The development contrasts with bitcoin\'s performance from 2014, in which it lost 56% of its value, the most among global currencies.\n\nA look at the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) from October on reveals an impressive upward arch that contrasts with the choppy peaks and valleys of the year\'s earlier months.\n\nThough the exact reasons are unclear, many pundits are pinning the currency\'s turnaround on the growing enterprise fascination with blockchain tech and the renewed mainstream attention from stories such as the alleged discovery of bitcoin\'s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nBut as we head into 2016, a big question remains to be answered: Will recent price positivity continue to buoyed by fundamental market improvements?\n\nWhile only time will provide the answer, we take a look back at the price movements over the last 12 months for clues and considerations.\n\nJanuary\n\nDespite starting the year at just over $300, the bitcoin price crashed to a low of around $170 on 14th January, losing 37% of its value in two days. As an example of just how sudden and dramatic the drop was, even noted bitcoin bull Barry Silbert proclaimed the market had ""capitulated"".\n\nThe last time the price had crossed the $200 line had been in late October 2013, before its meteoric rise to more than $1,000.\n\nThe low price wasn\'t bad news for everyone, however. Traders got busy accumulating new positions and exchanges had their busiest day since a price rally in November 2014.\n\nThe price rebounded somewhat over the following 12 days to just over $270 and ended the month on a high note as the price rocketed over $300, seemingly at the news that exchange and wallet provider Coinbase had closed a $75m funding round.\n\nFebruary\n\nFebruary started on a low note as Coinbase euphoria waned and the price fell back below $250.\n\nMid-month, however, the bitcoin price gained nearly $50 in four days of trading. This represented a 23% gain over that period.\n\nSoon, as was to become tediously common, the price once again settled back below $250, undulating around $240 before a slight climb to over $250 to close the month.\n\nMarch\n\nBitcoin price gains that peaked at $286 were supported by strong volume growth early in the month. Some 3.67m BTC changed hands on the week ending 7th March, which was a 55% increase over the previous seven-day period.\n\nThe second half of the month saw a reprisal of the slump to the low $200s.\n\nApril to June\n\nThe above pattern was to repeat through the three months April to June, when the price generally sat level at between $220 and $240.\n\nThe best one could say about the situation, perhaps, was that the notoriously volatile digital currency had ""found a floor"", a positive for those who consider the digital currency a viable store of value.\n\nThe development wasn\'t so good for traders, of course, but many have said that low volatility is key if bitcoin is ever to go mainstream as a method of payment.\n\nOn 17th June, after months of relative calm, the price of bitcoin finally broke out of the doldrums and spiked to a high of $257.\n\nOne of the most prominent theories that emerged to explain the rise was related to the market\'s timing, which roughly coincided with growing indications that Greece would possibly default on its debt obligations – the \'Grexit\', as it had been nicknamed.\n\nThe fervent hope among many in the bitcoin community was that Greeks would switch to the digital currency as they saw their banks accounts frozen and ways to move money in or out, such as PayPal and Western Union, were shut off in the country while a deal was hammered out with the EU.\n\nDespite media reports selling that line, some commentators said it was just as likely that the price rise was a coincidence and the evidence for Greeks adopting bitcoin was very thin on the ground.\n\nThe price dropped slightly in the days after, before finishing June on a high of over $260.\n\nJuly\n\nOn 13th July, the bitcoin price continued to climb, shooting past the $300 mark and reaching its highest level since 10th March.\n\nMany still put the rises down to the economic situation in Greece; others attributed it to the psychological effect of people hoping for such a trend.\n\nMid-month, CoinDesk launched a reader\'s poll that concluded that some 62% of bitcoin enthusiasts believed the digital currency would be worth less than $500 at the end of this year. (While the trend is in the right direction to top $500, it\'s looking like our readers were right as we go to press).\n\nAfter the possibly-Greek-influenced climb early in July, the price dropped slightly and spent the rest of the month around $275 to $290.\n\nAugust\n\nA general downward price trend through the month was interrupted by two notable negative events brought about by a single bitcoin exchange.\n\nFirstly, on the 19th August, a \'flash crash\' at Hong Kong-based Bitfinex caused the price of a bitcoin to nosedive 14% in a period of just 30 minutes.\n\nThe price had been holding steady between $250 and $255, but dropped to a low of $214.36 just before midnight (UTC). In the same period, the Bitfinex price sank 29% to $179.35.\n\nThe exchange told CoinDesk at the time that the flash crash was triggered when several leveraged positions were forcibly closed in close proximity to each other.\n\nThen, on the 24th, just a few days later, the price slumped again after Bitfinex closed its order book for seven hours, citing issues with its post-trade processing.\n\nSeptember\n\nGenerally uneventful, September\'s prices hovered in the $230 to $240 range, with a peak at around $245 on 8th September.\n\nWhat was promising, however, was the signs of a rising trend towards the close of the month, though it closed at just $236.\n\nOctober\n\nThat upward trend noted at the end of September continued through October until it achieved a price of over $260 on 13th October, its highest price in two months.\n\nThe raise may have been caused by a sudden surge in bitcoin trading volume driven predominantly by the Chinese exchanges Huobi and OKCoin.\n\nBobby Lee, CEO of Chinese exchange BTCC, told CoinDesk at the time that his platform has seen a significant volume increase, though he dismissed much of his competitors\' volume as ""artificial"".\n\nThose behind the volume, he said, are not traders but consumers sucked into a Russian ponzi scheme, MMM.\n\nThe price trend nonetheless continued skywards and on 28th October it broke through the $300 barrier on the CoinDesk BPI for the first time in over three months.\n\nSoon after, the price was at a new high for 2015, peaking at $333.75 on the 30th.\n\nNovember\n\nThe positive trend continued into November, with the price rapidly reaching, first $400 on the 3rd, then over $480 on the 4th of the month.\n\nThe sudden rise prompted Wedbush Securities to revise its 12-month projections for the price of bitcoin and revealing it expects the price to rise to $600 over the next year.\n\nAfter a sharp drop on the 11th that took the price back down to close to $300, it settled down to a new normal of around $325 for much of the remainder of the month, with a rise at the close to over $370.\n\nDecember\n\nSo, here we are in the closing month of 2015, and the price is trending up.\n\nOn the 15th, it reached the highest level since September 2014, climbing to more than $465 across most major exchanges.\n\nDespite a slight drop since then, pundits are enthusiastic, with many arguing the industry is poised for a positive start to 2016.\n\nWhat is your prediction for the bitcoin price in 2016?

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', ""Editor's Note: This piece was originally published on Medium by Co-Founder of Bloq Inc. & Bitcoin Core Developer Jeff Garzik and Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation & Bitcoin Core Developer Gavin Andresen.\n\nDisclaimer: The following is personal opinion and does not reflect an official position by Bloq, MIT or any other organization or group.\n\nThe proposed roadmap currently being discussed in the bitcoin community has some good points in that it does have a plan to accommodate more transactions, but it fails speak plainly to bitcoin users and acknowledge key downsides. The roadmap summary most relevant to bitcoin users is:\n\nBitcoin is shifting to a new economic policy, with possibly higher fees.\n\nCore block size does not change; there has been zero compromise on that issue. In the face of rising transaction volume — it has doubled over the past year — getting stuck at 1M results in higher fees, notable economic changes, and suffers from increased political risk by embracing an accidentally-created economic policy tool.\n\nChange By Design\n\nHigher fees and reshaping the fee market impact all bitcoin users, yet it is only mentioned obliquely in paragraph 18 of the roadmap:\n\nThese proposals help […] prevent defection between the miners from undermining the fee market behavior that will eventually fund security.”\n\nand in the middle of paragraph 4 of another BIP by the same devs:\n\nThe development of a fee market and the evolution towards an ecosystem that is able to cope with block space competition should be considered healthy. […] However, the purpose of such a change should be evolution with technological growth, and not kicking the can down the road because of a fear of change in economics.”\n\nNotable devs think it necessary to change bitcoin to a different economic system with “healthy” competition for block space. In the field today, that is accomplished by maintaining the core block size in the face of rising transaction volume — an outcome the current dev consensus has produced, and the roadmap continues.\n\nIn an optimal, transparent, open source environment, a BIP would be produced, covering a change in bitcoin’s economics to a “healthy fee market.” This would be analyzed through the lenses of technical, economic, hard fork etc. risk. This has not happened.\n\nThere would also be a related BIP describing the basic requirements for a full node in terms of RAM, CPU processing, storage and network upload bandwidth, based on experiments — not simulations — done on a platform like planet-lab.org. This would help determine quantitatively how many nodes could propagate information rapidly enough to maintain Bitcoin’s decentralized global consensus at a given block size.\n\nGetting stuck at 1M core block size transforms a historic DoS limit into an accidental policy tool. Satoshi added the 1M consensus limit in 2010, intentionally set above the free market fee range. This artificial ceiling acts against network DoS, raising the cost of attack. Setting the limit above free market range resulted in a safety limit reasonably free from politics.\n\nThe update process was also described by Satoshi in 2010.\n\nAs average block size approaches the 1M limit, the game theory picture changes. The accidental, artificial 1M limit becomes a Visible Hand in the market. Competition occurs not only for block space, but for developer consensus — because in this new economic system, the ability to freeze or move the 1M limit produces a system where humans — not the free market directly — wield oversize power.\n\nBy accident or design, Satoshi managed to create a working free market and push this Visible Hand years into the future by setting the limit high, well above the free market range for transaction fees. The limit served for years as a DoS limit, exponentially increasing cost-of-attack, while a free market equilibrium range established itself.\n\nThis block size debate ultimately comes down to competing economic and system survival theories. One theory is that a free market range exists for block size, in absence of a hard limit. Another theory is that a hard limit is required to forcibly constrain the free market. Stalling on core block size changes the former to the latter — uncharted territory for bitcoin.\n\nA System-wide Upgrade To Avoid A System-wide Upgrade\n\nThe resultant bitcoin user and market view is muddled: From 2010 through Scaling Bitcoin:Montreal, it appeared that the core block size would see an increase. Following Scaling Bitcoin:Hong Kong, the roadmap abruptly switches direction to Segregated Witness (SW).\n\nSW avoids an ecosystem-wide hard fork through ecosystem-wide upgrades to bitcoin transactions, blocks, addresses, scripts, full nodes, miners, wallets, explorers, libraries, and APIs. All to provide partial relief to core block pressure assuming users upgrade — 1.6M if 100% upgrade, based on current usage.\n\nSW roll-out requires extensive software modifications just to maintain current functionality in the face of rising transaction volume. SW complicates bitcoin economics by splitting a “block” into a basket of two economic resources — core block and extended block — each with unique price incentives and (heavily intersecting) sets of actors.\n\nIn contrast, increased core block size is compatible with existing bitcoin software; Some wallets will work seamlessly with no change at all. The total number and scope of changes to wallets, databases, libraries etc. is very minimal. The high hurdle is the hard fork itself.\n\nOne of the explicit goals of the Scaling Bitcoin workshops was to funnel the chaotic core block size debate into an orderly decision making process. That did not occur. In hindsight, Scaling Bitcoin stalled a block size decision while transaction fee price and block space pressure continue to increase. Scaling Bitcoin was useful in surveying consensus on core block size. 2M appears to be the consensus most common denominator.\n\nSkipping Hard Questions Until Too Late\n\nThe roadmap skips the short term issues of:\n\nWhen are fees too high?\n\nWhat is the process for changing core block size then?\n\nWhy do we need high fees at this early stage of bitcoin’s life?\n\nRather than an automated software system, a fixed core block size puts an economic policy tool in the hands of humans. Humans are making subjective decisions about “healthy” fee levels, what miner income should look like, and the relative expense of bitcoin transactions, rather than the free market.\n\nUsers have concerns that this roadmap and new economic direction dances obliquely around a shift of bitcoin from a network for P2P cash payments to a settlement system for as-yet-incomplete technology such as side chains or payment channels, pushing out businesses that bought into the original “P2P electronic cash” vision of bitcoin. As the RootStock white paper notes:\n\nIf Bitcoin block size is not increased via a hard-fork, when the next Bitcoin reward halves, Bitcoin transaction fees may become prohibitively high for certain applications.”\n\nMaybe that’s inevitable. However, in the short term, we have a disappointing situation where a subset of dev consensus is disconnected from the oft-mentioned desire to increase block size on the part of users, businesses, exchanges and miners. This reshapes bitcoin in ways full of philosophical and economic conflicts of interest. As noted here, inaction changes bitcoin, sets it on a new path.\n\nWay Forward\n\nBitcoin is not an academic science project. Stalling on hard questions produces tangible market changes. Few have the luxury to pause until a new payment layer is developed on top of bitcoin-1’s emerging settlement layer. Stuck-at-1M risks reversing bitcoin’s network effect by pricing users out of the core blockchain, forcing them onto centralized platforms.\n\nA better way forward includes leadership on a definitive short term core block size decision, plain talk with users about exploring new fee market economic theories and system survival theories, and plain talk with users about the risks and possible negative consequences of getting stuck at 1M.\n\nCore block size resolution and validation cost edge cases are the top priorities. A positive outcome of Scaling Bitcoin was a consensus of 2M, assuming some validation DoS fixes. Segregated Witness can proceed in parallel, sans the assumptions that it’s an easy change or that it mitigates economic issues described above.\n\nAnd finally, to remove long term moral hazard, core block size limit should be made dynamic, put in the realm of software, outside of human hands.\n\nBitcoin deserves a roadmap that balances the needs of everybody who has worked hard over the last six years to grow the entire ecosystem.\n\n—Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen"", ""Mainstream users require a debit card in order to make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a part of their daily lives. What is the result of this year and what is the future of the Bitcoin debit card market in 2016 & 2017? CoinTelegraph interviewed Ted Rogers, the president of XAPO, one of the world leading companies issuing Bitcoin debit cards.\n\nCoinTelegraph: There are dozens of Bitcoin debit cards in the world. Are there any statistics about this market, that are gathered by any association? How can we know, who the leaders are in this market?\n\nTed Rogers: Unfortunately, no one association that I know of. The number of bitcoin debit cards is still so small that not many industry groups are paying attention. Maybe as the ecosystem matures, someone will begin to track it. The only ones I see with meaningful activity are Xapo, ANX and E-Coin.\n\nCT: What can we expect in the market of BTC cards next year?\n\nTR: Certainly you will see more bitcoin-related cards, both from independent startups and from existing wallet and exchange platforms. More choice is good thing, although I’m not certain that companies seeking to provide debit cards understand the amount of work involved in launching and maintaining a card program. Hopefully, they won’t find out the hard way.\n\nI would also expect more players from traditional financials services to become more actively and visibly involved in card programs, although this might occur more in 2017 than 2016.\n\nCT: What will be the main movements in its development?\n\nTR: In terms of functionality, the same choices should remain: users can either order a preload card, in which case they must load their bitcoins onto the card before using it, or a true debit card, in which case there is no extra step required before spending (this is the kind of card Xapo provides).\n\nOther than that, we all need to focus on improving user experience. For example, card ordering and activation, reduced transaction declines and more efficient KYC upgrades.\n\nCT: What were the main events of the past year?\n\nTR: Several more debit cards launched in the market and, as I said, more choice is a good thing – we are talking about a very big market, so there is room for multiple players. More importantly, we saw growing adoption and usage of debit cards, especially in the second half of the year.\n\nBitcoin as a currency will be a killer app in countries in which consumers cannot rely on the local currency but only if consumers can buy and spend bitcoin very easily. Until a sufficient number of bitcoin-accepting merchants exist, a debit card is essential for the “spend” side of the equation.\n\nCT: Who are the main players that will change the market?\n\nTR: The card networks (Visa, Mastercard, Discover) and banks can change the market radically, if they seize the opportunity that bitcoin presents. Bitcoin companies can’t do it without these third parties. 2016 will see more of these entities enter the market but it will continue to be a slow process.\n\nCT: Will the market be divided between different companies according to the geographical position of every company issuing cards, or will there be 1-2 leaders that conquer 80% of the world market? Can you tell us the statistics for today about card companies' presence all over the world? And can you make a prognosis for the next year? Will the picture of the market be changed greatly?\n\nTR: Companies that already have large amounts of wallet users have a distribution advantage, obviously, and pure card startups will have some trouble overcoming that advantage. That said, there really is room for independent card companies – startups – to have success. We are talking about a huge, nascent global market.\n\nOn the other hand, any company will require a minimum amount of infrastructure in order to successfully maintain a card program, which means pure card startups will need to raise a meaningful amount of capital in order to stay in business. I suspect many investors will view a debit card as a good product but not an independent business. We’ll see.\n\nCT: Anything else that the clients of world card companies should know on the eve of NY 2016?\n\nTR: There was a lot of hype around the importance of a debit card in early and mid 2014. Then it died down (like a lot of bitcoin hype). The initial inclination, however, was correct: debit cards serve a vital role in bitcoin adoption. Until we have a critical mass of merchants that accept bitcoin – and I think we are years away from that – mainstream users require a debit card in order to make bitcoin a part of their daily lives. Debit cards provide a bridge to a future in which bitcoin is ubiquitous and, ironically, debit cards are no longer necessary – but we are a decade away from that and until then debit cards are essential.\n\nStatistics of Bitcoin Debit Card Usage\n\nWhat Bitcoin Debit Card do you use?

We recommend you get acquainted with our ratings of the top blockchain companies and cryptocurrencies."", 'Despite false starts, scams and startup crash-and-burns, the digital currency bitcoin is enjoying the tail end of a strong year. According to The Hacker News, however, a number of core developers have now left bitcoin to form their own organization — Company 0 — and develop a new kind of cryptocurrency called Decred. But can this venture succeed where others have failed? And if so, is there enough global elbow room for two digital-dollar giants?\n\nA Shiny Future for Digital Currency?\n\nPredictions from Coin Desk suggested that bitcoin will enjoy a banner year through 2016 as the network begins to scale and the currency shines as a safe-haven asset for investors looking to shore up liquidity. Sidechain technologies — which allow bitcoins to be moved from the main blockchain to higher-level protocols — will also enjoy a boom as they adopt an open-source model.\n\nOf course, successfully mining, trading and commoditizing bitcoins isn’t easy. EconoTimes noted that startup after startup has fallen as bitcoin prices fluctuated and companies weren’t able to stay profitable.\n\nFor example, Mining ASIC Technologies got off to a solid start but was bankrupt by the end of 2014. Similarly, bitcoin buying service Brawker, which lets consumers buy products with the digital currency, will shutter its doors in April 2016, citing competition and workload issues. So it’s worth asking: What makes Decred different, and how can it avoid the same pitfalls as bitcoin?\n\nExisting Issues\n\nAccording to Softpedia, the new cryptocurrency is looking to solve what Company 0 CEO Jacob Yocom-Piatt said is the biggest problem with bitcoin: It’s controlled by a small group of external actors who decide how the service will evolve, often in spite of developer objections and to the detriment of users. To address the problem, former bitcoin developers are opting for a decentralized, community-based governance model. The Decred team also plans to introduce a number of features that include:\n\nA consenus-based system using proof of work and proof of stake;\n\nHashing via the Blake-256 algorithm;\n\nEd25519/secp256k1-Schnorr or secp256k1 signatures to improve software integration; and\n\nPotential bitcoin compatibility.\n\nSimply put, Decred wants to eliminate governance and decision-making issues that plague bitcoin while keeping many of the central functions intact. It makes sense: Bitcoin has garnered enough positive attention and investor confidence that there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Rather, the cryptocurrency aims to coast along on bitcoin’s momentum with promises of improved security and better collaboration.\n\nIs Decred the next bitcoin? Maybe. More importantly, however, is that bitcoin is the current bitcoin — in other words, a digital currency that actually garners public and investor support. The result is a positive outlook for bitcoin and tangent technologies, which encourages two outcomes: increased security for investors and the emergence of strong competition. It’s capitalism at work — if not Decred now, then another competitor in the near future. Bitcoin is up, business is booming and the virtual finance future is just starting to take shape.', 'An alliance of developers have already begun work on a new cryptocurrency, Decred. The new currency is based upon the same Bitcoin model that was previously used with all other cryptocurrencies. However, Decred is saving the main technical features of Bitcoin and fixing all of the issues that Bitcoin had.\n\nWhile the only clear contributors to the project are community-based such as are Github users, it can be assumed that the developers have a large amount of experience with Bitcoin development, and may even be the original Bitcoin Core developers.\n\nDecred will serve as a hybridized proof-of-work/proof-of-stake consensus system that allows users to create a balance between proof-of-work miners and proof-of-stake users to develop a much more robust consensus.\n\nWhy Decred is Unique\n\nYou may be wondering: why is another cryptocurrency needed? Well, when Bitcoin was originally released, they were working in a market that did not even exist yet. There were flaws in the concept that can be fixed with the release of new cryptocurrencies such as Decred, Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc.\n\nBitcoin wasn’t a failure, it changed the idea of currency for better and for always. While a more extensive list of new Decred feature can be found on their website, the entire currency is based on the idea of combining the very best of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake Blockchains in an attempt to utilize both systems in Decred.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Co-Founder of Ethereum and Ether cryptocurrency, told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Right now, I believe that in order to succeed, a new blockchain project has to bring something genuinely new to the table, and it can\'t just be a slightly better consensus algorithm.”\n\nWhether or not Decred can execute this concept will be determined after its release. Decred has another major goal in mind. Bitcoin, because it was the first of its kind, had trouble getting public outreach and funding. Decred aims to fix these issues by claiming itself “self-funded and progressive” relying completely on community governance and opensource qualities.\n\nDespite a full list of improvements, Another Co-Founder of Ethereum, Anthony Di Lorio, said:\n\n""Decred is not worth spending time and resources pursuing, because it does not present anything unique or worthwhile""\n\nMining and Wallet System\n\nSo that all Decred users could have access to a GUI regardless of platform, they have developed an online wallet service from BitPay’s Copay wallet and its dependencies. The wallet will allow for basic functionality such as sending and receiving Decred coins. For the more technically minded, there will also be a command line version of the Decred wallet.\n\nAs for mining Decred coins, a simplistic AMD GPU miner that works with a local daemon will be made available before the launch. After the currency becomes stable, Decred will release proper “getblocktemplate” functionality and get some pool software up and running.\n\nFunding Strategies\n\nRather than asking interested parties for donations, Decred has chosen to receive funding entirely from its individual developers. As for the plan for public outreach and engagement, there is some controversy.\n\nSusanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, CEO of Bitnation, told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Decred is currently utilizing highly unethical marketing strategies, making it a project with possibly fraudulent intentions”\n\nHowever, Decred has also been through several stages of funding from Company 0, a company that has also supported Bitcoin since its release. Making the source of funding very reliable.\n\nIn a press release, Jacob Yocom-Piatt, CEO of Company 0 said:\n\n“Many people may not know that despite the technological decentralization Bitcoin has brought the world, there are serious and growing issues of centralization that rule decisions made about the present and future of the project. The Bitcoin software is controlled by a small group of people who decide exclusively what can and cannot be changed. This is in part due to a lack of mechanisms and pathways for funding development work directly from the community, and as a result Bitcoin development is funded by external entities that create conflicts of interest between the developers and the representative power of the community that uses Bitcoin.”\n\nAirdrop\n\nDecred is gearing up for an airdrop of coins. The airdrop allows the Decred network to expand, decentralize the distribution of the coins, and attract the right interest and people for Decred. Registration for the airdrop is now open. However, if you plan to register, do it fast because it caps at 5000 people. If you are among the selected, then you will be given a form that you can use to submit your Decred wallet address. Of course, since there are no public wallets available yet, you must use the binaries and source code provided. While airdrops are only the first step towards success, the NXT Foundation believes that Decred needs to be more than a plan.\n\nBas Wisselink, Co-Founder of NXT Foundation, told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“It’s pretty much like any other startup with aims to which it\'s hard to say ‘no’ to, but once again without providing anything more than plans. Unless this is more than just a plan, it will probably go the same way any airdrop went: it will get dumped and then no interest will remain. After 6 years of crypto, the window for ‘just a plan’ has closed. A project needs to be able to truly offer something new. If it does, it can expect a bootstrap period of at least 2-3 years.”\n\nWhether or not you are interested in Decred does not matter. It will be yet another driving force in the financial world.

Ltd. after it appeared to cease trading with users reporting they were unable to obtain withdrawals from the site and that the company was not responding to support tickets.\n\nAs of December, the company claims to have paid back 92 percent of funds, but ominously its website remains live and is still taking deposits it cannot immediately pay back.\n\nThe year in dodgy operators brings us to October when we first reported that Bitcoin and altcoin exchange Cryptsy (Project Investors, Inc.) was in serious trouble and was refusing to pay out users.\n\nThe exchange, remarkably, is still accepting funds, but two months later users are still claiming they are unable to withdraw Bitcoin from it.\n\nMt. Gox\n\nThe now notorious failure of Japanese Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox may have occurred in 2014, but further and even more colorful developments in the investigation into the case kept keyboards busy throughout the year.\n\nIn January, Japanese police announced that after an investigation into the exchange they had found nearly all the missing Bitcoins had been stolen through internal systems and hence was an inside job, not via hacking, as had been previously alleged by founder Mark Karpeles.\n\nKarpeles fun for the year was only just beginning, though, with an allegation in March that he was Dread Pirate Roberts, the mastermind behind the former online drugs bazaar Silk Road.\n\nIn a remarkable turn of events in April, a report from Bitcoin security firm WizSec found that most or all of the missing Bitcoins were stolen straight out of the Mt. Gox hot wallet over time, beginning in late-2011, with nearly all of them gone by mid-2013.\n\nDuring this period, Japanese police continued their investigation, and it wasn’t good news for Karpeles when news broke at the end of July that they were preparing to arrest him.\n\nSubsequently, Karpeles was not arrested once, but multiple times on differing charges: first in August when he admitted to creating fake Bitcoins, and then again later that month on embezzlement charges.\n\nIn September, Karpeles was formally charged with embezzlement, with the police claiming that he misappropriated $2.6 million of deposits from the trading accounts of Mt. Gox customers, including $48,000 for the acquisition of a bed.\n\nThird time’s the charm as they say, with Karpeles being arrested for a third time in October on a new charge relating to Karpeles moving ¥20 million (US$166,000) in client money to his bank account, with at least some of this money being spent on prostitutes.\n\nNo doubt we’ll hear much, much more on the sordid tale of Mark Karpeles and Mt. Gox in the year ahead.\n\nFailed startups\n\nSometimes startups offer a solution looking for a problem, and that certainly was the case with a number of failures in 2015.\n\nBitcoin wallet service provider 37coins, Inc. closed in August after its appallingly stupid model of catering for the “unbanked” and “unteched” in “developing economies without Internet access” with an SMS Bitcoin service that not only failed to take off, but never left the gate at the airport.\n\nBitcoin reputation startup Bonafide folded in November but only after burning through $850,000 in investors’ money to ascertain that people use Bitcoin because it’s anonymous and don’t want a reputation and name put to their transactions.\n\nMining firm BTCS tried really hard to go out of business also in November when it disclosed it was literally running out of money after burning millions without making a profit, but demonstrating a touch of the Lazarus remarkably announced $1.4 million in new funding in December to keep them going … for now.\n\nHonorable mention\n\nWe couldn’t finish a colorful year of Bitcoin failures, scams and arrests without an honorable mention to the two dopey guys who thought it was best to bring their Bitcoin-related dispute before the Honorable Judge Judy.\n\nIf you missed the story back in November, not only is it worth a laugh, unsurprisingly Judy had no idea what Bitcoin was as well.\n\nImage credit: Judge Judy', 'Preston Byrne is a co-founder and COO of Eris Industries and a fellow of the Adam Smith Institute. Previously, he was a securitisation and derivatives lawyer with Norton Rose Fulbright in London and he continues to ""geek out"" on high finance.\n\nIt’s been said the only way to win the game of life is for your obituary to run in The Economist.\n\nBy that measure, the blockchain (or rather, the idea of a blockchain as a distributed database, rather than merely a backbone for a cryptocurrency) is certainly doing well.\n\nThis year alone, the blockchain has chalked up dozens (if not hundreds) of articles in most financial periodicals of record and the cover, no less, of The Economist. Even liberal culture hero Lawrence Lessig recently called the technology ""the most important innovation in fundamental architecture since the tubes of the Internet were first developed"".\n\nI agree with this assessment, albeit cautiously. I was there when bitcoin\'s earliest adopters were describing their technology in similarly high-flying terms (back in the heady days of Charlie Shrem and Mark Karpeles, before anyone noticed the three transaction-per-second throughput limits or before FinCEN got antsy about MSB licensing).\n\nIt’s the same now with blockchains.\n\nAlthough the technology has considerable potential, given that so few people actually know how to build with it, there is a risk that failing to be sufficiently sober about its capabilities and straightforward about its drawbacks will lead us to apply it in ways that will not showcase this potential at its best.\n\nI would therefore like to humbly offer a few sober and fairly boring predictions for 2016, in the hope that this puts everyone in a hype-free state of mind for the new year.\n\n1. Nobody will own the stack\n\nI’m often asked by journalists and VCs whether the blockchain game is a \'winner take all\' proposition.\n\nTo ask the question betrays a degree of ignorance about what blockchains actually do. Blockchains allow disparate groups to do things on a peer-to-peer basis that, to date, they have relied on third parties like IBM, Google or Amazon to do for them. They cut the data service provider, whomever that might be, out of the transaction and let the blockchain\'s pre-set transaction management rules do the heavy lifting.\n\nLet’s take bitcoin as an example.\n\nMost bitcoiners, when asked what problem bitcoin solves, will quickly respond with something like ""trust"" or ""value"" or ""intermediaries."" But if we reread the white paper from a teleological point of view, these aspects of the bitcoin solution were the means to achieving an objective, not the objective itself.\n\nIn the most abstract terms, the point of bitcoin is to provide verification and authentication for a particular type of transaction (cash payment) without the provision of personal information by either of the participants. In Satoshi’s own words, the problem bitcoin solves is privacy.\n\nTo do this with money, you need to create both new money (bitcoin) as well as a distributed network architecture that doesn’t depend on a central machine (the blockchain). To do this with most commercial data, however, you don’t need to create a new asset class. What you need is to wrest control of network infrastructure away from existing data service providers and allow people to run that infrastructure themselves.\n\nBlockchains make sense because privacy and verifiability are not just problems in payments. Current free-to-use services, from search to email to social networking, are dependent on advertising revenue to fund their operations.\n\nAs a result, companies offering these services must – to paraphrase Satoshi Nakamoto – hassle their users for considerably more information than they would otherwise need. This necessity has skewed the Internet toward a more centralized infrastructure than was originally intended, with attendant consequences for personal liberty and data security.\n\nWhere bitcoin was designed to solve this centralisation problem in relation to point-of-sale and banking transactions, private blockchains hold the promise of distributing – if not fully decentralising – the logic of all manner of other apps. If we can prove who we are and enforce our relationships with cryptography, we don’t have to share as much data with each other.\n\nFor our part, Eris has built a distributed Reddit and distributed YouTube (both open-source, so feel free to steal the code) all with a view to proving one thing: the blockchain, together with other new technologies such as IPFS, is DIY Internet.\n\nNobody owns HTTP, and nobody’s going to own blockchain.\n\n2. Blockchains will be accepted as general-purpose databases\n\nLast week\'s news that IBM had developed a free, open-source blockchain and was donating that code to the Linux Foundation was greeted with widespread derision by the bitcoin community, including a number of prominent VCs.\n\nThis lack of enthusiasm is extremely odd, keeping in mind the \'DIY Internet\' that blockchain tech allows. Although bitcoin fans grate at the idea that permissioned databases should bear the name, it\'s clear from the white paper that bitcoin and the blockchain are clearly not the same thing.\n\nAfter all, bitcoin is ""a purely peer to peer version of electronic cash"", while a blockchain is four pages of technical writing that follows the phrase “a purely peer to peer version of electronic cash” and describe the database back-end that runs that application.\n\nIf we were to summarise those four pages, we might come up with something like this: a shared datastore for peer-to-peer networks designed to ""reliably (manage) a large amount of data in a multi-user environment so that many users can concurrently access the same data.""\n\nIf the latter line sounds familiar, it\'s because it is. The part in quotation marks is Oracle describing its own open-source database management systems.\n\nSimilarly, at Eris, our thesis is simple: what relational database management systems such as MySQL were in the 1990s and 2000s for computing silos, blockchains are in the 2010s and 2020s for distributed networks.\n\nSo how is a \'private blockchain\' innovative vis-a-vis existing databases? As Tim Swanson wrote about bitcoin, ""while all the individual elements that comprise the bitcoin blockchain have been around since 2001, it took until Satoshi\'s 2008 white paper to demonstrate how these individual pieces could be cobbled together to work as one.""\n\nPrivate blockchains simply mix and match new components to better fit particular use cases. Where bitcoin needs (1) a timestamp server (which ‘chains the blocks’), (2) hashcash\'s proof-of-work algorithm, and (3) a digital signature scheme (ECDSA secp256k1),\n\nMost commercial chains with permissioning systems just keep what we need (the timestamping) and swap out what we don\'t with better components (eg: the Tendermint consensus algorithm plus EdDSA ed22519 signature algorithm).\n\nIn 2016, this proposition will no longer be controversial.\n\n3. Mining will be (mostly) relegated to irrelevance\n\nMining is not, and will likely not ever be, relevant to running a private blockchain.\n\nThe reasons for this are fairly straightforward: bitcoin mining isn’t \'transaction processing\' or \'transaction validation\', as both of these are done on an ongoing basis by full nodes on the bitcoin network as they propagate valid transactions to one another (verifying digital signatures).\n\n\'Mining\' is not about validation: it is about fork choice. With a decentralised system like bitcoin\'s, anyone in the world can add a block to the end of the chain. As a result, a competitive mechanism is needed to penalise bad conduct.\n\nA private blockchain, on the other hand, is designed to suit a very specific coordination and communication need for a very specific person or group of people, some (or all) of which will be known.\n\nIf you control those nodes or know who runs them, you can use the same digital signatures that secure a bitcoin balance (a write permission to spend bitcoin) to secure the chain (a write permission to add a block to the end of a chain).\n\nChain security thus becomes a question of sufficiently distributing your nodes and effective key management. These are difficult problems, but they are (if done well) as effective and significantly more flexible than bitcoin’s approach.\n\nFor bitcoin itself, of course, mining is likely to remain relevant for some years to come until a better solution can be found.\n\n4. Code, don\'t talk\n\nWhere 2015 was the year everyone talked about blockchain, 2016 is going to be the year everyone builds on it.\n\nThere’s a lot of experimentation, improvement and optimisation left to do. In my personal opinion, we’re two budget cycles away from the first production systems in finance, and I agree with Chris Skinner, chair of the Financial Services Club, that we’re probably 10 years away from mainstream use.\n\nBy ""mainstream use,"" of course, I mean that applications with blockchain back-ends are ubiquitous and the end-users don’t even know they’re using a blockchain.\n\nFor the time being, however, there are numerous distributed networking platforms – including our own, OpenChain, Tendermint, MultiChain, and IPFS – which exist, work, and are free to use, and which some of the world’s largest corporations are already testing to solve difficult commercial problems, particularly in terms of business process efficiency.\n\nWhat this means for any financial institution or other business looking to use the tech is that the ball is entirely in your court.\n\nIt’s cheap as chips to get started and there’s much to be learned, so there’s simply no excuse not to allocate budget and let your developers loose on this for a year – especially considering that your competitors already are.\n\nWant to share your opinion on bitcoin or blockchain in 2015, or a prediction for the year ahead?

It is not a concept that many banks and national governments practice providing to their citizenry. You may get lip service to that effect, but the oppression, not the opportunity of the people is what usually takes place, at scale. Take Bitcoin in Africa, for example. Bitcoin is a natural fit, and could be a revolutionary technological change for the people of many African nations. How’s it going? Let’s take a closer look at BitPesa, Bitcoin, and Africa.\n\nBitPesa has been working on bringing Bitcoin to the people of Africa since 2013, as the creation of Elizabeth Rossiello and Duncan Goldie -Scot. It is a Bitcoin-based follow-up to the famous M-Pesa text-based phone payment network that revolutionized Kenya and Tanzania in the Spring of 2007, M-Pesa went from a tech concept in a cash-based society to the leading form of payment, generating almost 50% of the countries GDP by 2014.\n\nBitPesa has not been the breakaway success so far that M-Pesa has been. They have tried to forge some alliance with M-Pesa, owned by Vodafone/Safaricom/ Vodacom, but this has not worked out. The two sides are in court and BitPesa has been removed from the M-Pesa network, which is in appeals by BitPesa. M-Pesa has expanded to South Africa and Afghanistan. M-Pesa has connected with 60 African banks, and operates in Uganda and Nigeria, as well.\n\n“As a company founded in Kenya, we built on M-Pesa; as a pan-African enterprise, we have gone above and beyond M-Pesa,” says Rossielo.\n\nBitPesa has been able to get thousands of Bitcoin users into their system, enough to generate a public response from the Central Bank of Kenya recently, warning against Bitcoin, and highlighting potential Bitcoin usage issues. While M-Pesa is based on cash and phone time exchanges, BitPesa works through Bitcoin, and this action by the central bank proves to Rossielo that BitPesa is becoming a factor in the free marketplace. BitPesa’s bitcoin services take monetary remittance fees down from an average of 10% to 3%, bringing value that the current banking community does not offer.\n\n""You can pay somebody in China instantly using bitcoin. There has been $1 billion in investment from venture capitalists in 2015 alone into this technology. Two billion dollars’ worth of bitcoin is traded every day. So why would Kenya close its eyes to this, and opt out of a new technology?"" Rossielo asked Anadolu Agency in an interview.\n\nA better question may be “Why should the banking and government support this economic initiative? Russell may be answering her own question. How does it serve the establishment to empower the people with new technology, 70% lower costs, and less money moving directly into the banking industry? A well-funded, more educated proletariat rarely serves government’s goals, in the long run. That’s assuming you know what government’s priorities are in the first place, which is to control the populace.\n\nIt wouldn’t surprise me if Bitcoin became illegal in more countries, primarily because it is a deregulated superior monetary system, designed to empower people worldwide. Keeping the locals ignorant of the incredible technologies and economic advantages of working outside of the establishment protects The State from competition, in he long run. What national partners like banks and government want Bitcoin to flourish domestically? “Power to the people” is a great slogan or mantra, and it certainly works on the campaign trail, see the Greek SYRIZA party election in 2014 as the most recent example. Once in office, is that really how the government operates, in practice?\n\nBFFs government and national banks love the status quo, and the control they enjoy over the populace. A public warning is most likely Stage 1 in a coming Kenyan establishment program against Bitcoin, and it’s associated businesses. Empowerment is a four-letter word in banking and government policy. BitPesa has awoken a sleeping giant. Their hopes of gaining an ally in M-Pesa’s network, a smart move strategically, seem to have failed. It looks like they will take on a three-headed monster of the banks, the government, and an ignorant population. I hope they’ve brought their lunch.\n\nThis is not just African nations, by the way. This is any Bitcoin business in most countries around the world. How many Icelanders are there, where the banking criminals are thrown in jail, the banks are closed, and the proceeds go to the citizens? Few nation-states are trying to build the perfect national philosophy, particularly economically. Nations are partners, if not flat-out dependent upon centralized national banking systems. The target market may be down with a superior new technology, but there are some serious dragons to slay before you get to Valhalla.', 'Sin duda, el 2015 ha sido un año de crecimiento para la red Bitcoin en el que no sólo aumento el número de transacciones y de bitcoins en circulación dentro de la red, sino que también se realizaron más investigaciones, inversiones y proyectos con la finalidad de contribuir con el desarrollo y la adopción de esta tecnología. De igual manera se estima que el año 2016 sea un año de mayor crecimiento y expansión para Bitcoin.', 'Tuur Demeester (Autor des englischsprachigen Original-Artikels) ist ein unabhängiger Investor und Chefredakteur bei Adamant Research. Adamant Research wurde Anfang 2015 gegründet und bietet einen monatlichen Newsletter Service. Hier findet ihr z.B. einen Bericht darüber: “Wie positioniere ich mich in der Bitcoin-Rallye”.\n\n2015 war eine weiteres “Achterbahn-Jahr” für Bitcoin: Es gab eine beachtliche Entwicklung in der Infrastruktur, heiße Debatten über die Skalierbarkeit und viele Unternehmen und Institutionen die auf die Blockchain gekommen sind. Hinzu kam ein kleiner Crash unter die 150 US-Dollar Marke, der aber schon schnell mit einen raschen Aufschwung auf bisher 500 US-Dollar kompensiert wurde.\n\nBlickten wir zunächst einmal auf die Hochs und Tiefs der vergangenen Jahre zurück um dann zu erörtern, was uns das Jahr 2016 bringen wird.\n\nHier meine Sicht auf die Geschichte von Bitcoin:\n\n2009-2010: Konzeption\n\nDas ist die Vorgeschichte von Bitcoin als eine Währung, in der es kaum einen Preis für die von einer Software geschaffenen Token gab.\n\nEs wurden zahlreiche technische Diskussionen geführt und die Kernentwickler stopften eine große Schwachstelle im Quellcode.\n\n2011: Die erste Blase und große Experimentierfreude\n\nDie ersten Bitcoin-Börsen kämpften um neue Nutzer und die Bitcoin Börse Mt Gox ging als klarer Gewinner aus dem Kampf hervor. Silk Road und BitPay werden gegründet und der Bitcoin erlebt mit einem Sprung von $1 auf $30 die erste Blase.\n\n2012: Glücksspiel, Spekulationen und Hebelwirkungen\n\nZu Beginn des Jahres gab es einige große Bitcoin Diebstähle und der Markt verlangte nach besseren und sicheren Bitcoin-Wallets.\n\nDas mangende Interesse am Bitcoin Preis wurde von Hebelwirkungen (Bitcoinica), Glücksspiel (Satoshi Dice), diversen Altcoins (Litecoin) und dem Bitcoin Mining (Butterfly Labs) kompensiert.\n\n2013: Der Mining-Boom\n\nNach mehreren Bitcoin-Todesanzeigen in namenhafter Zeitungen, meldete sich Bitcoin mit einen satten Rallye im Frühling zurück.\n\nNachrichten über enorme Gewinne der frühen Einsteiger sorgten für großes Aufsehen und durch die Entwicklung von eigens für das Mining hergestellte Hardware ließ der Mining-Boom nicht lange auf sich warten.\n\nBekräftigt wurde der Boom durch einen weiteren Kursanstieg in den letzten beiden Monaten des Jahres als der Preis für einen BTC auf über $1.000 sprunghaft anstieg. Die Mining Schwierigkeit stieg in diesem Jahr von 20 auf 90.000 Th/s.\n\n2014: Altcoin-Seitensprünge\n\nAngesichts des enormen Potentials der digitalen Währung wurden in 2014 bereits mehr als 300 Millionen US-Dollar in Bitcoin-Startups investiert – das ist vier Mal so hoch wie im Vorjahr.\n\nAber nicht allen Sektoren des Bitcoin-Business erging es so gut: Spekulativer Überschwang, Übereifer der Mining-Hardware Hersteller und die unaufhörlich steigende Schwierigkeit führte dazu, dass beim Bitcoin- Mining die Räder flogen. Das Resultat waren Lieferstornos, Auslieferungen nicht mehr profitabler Hardware und eine Reihe von insolventen Startups (auch Tuur Demeester verbrannte hier einiges an Geld).\n\nMit Blick auf den sinkenden Bitcoin-Preis und der Mining-Überkapazität wurden erste Vermutungen breitgetreten, dass Bitcoin zu starr sei, eine langweilige Marke verkörperten das Mining-Netztwerk zu ineffizient sei.\n\nAls Antwort darauf schossen Altcoins wie Pilze aus dem Boden, die angeblich all diese Probleme beheben können… oder rein gar keine Versprechen gaben wie beispielsweise Dogecoin. Bitcoin Investoren sprangen auf den Zug der Altcoins auf um ihr Portfolio breiter zu fächern und ihr Risiko zu minimieren. Für manche wird es die richtige Entscheidung gewesen sein denn in 2014 gab es mehrere Altcoin-Blasen.\n\nBitcoin in 2015: Blockchain Hype und ein reifes Ökosystem\n\nViele Investoren leiden noch immer unter den Preisrückgang und der Konsolidierung von Bitcoin in 2015. Doch unter der Haube verbirgt sich ein riesiges Potential und ein Motor der allmählich zu brüllen beginnt.\n\nMit limitiertem Anstieg spekulativen Interesse und mehr als 3.600 frisch geeinten und für den Markt verfügbaren Bitcoins täglich, zeigte sich der Preis über das Jahr 2015 hinweg recht zurückhaltend. Viele Großinvestoren verkauften Anteile ihres Bitcoin-Vermögens und das eher aus der Not heraus als aus persönlichem Interesse. Damit vielen viele dieser Bitcoins in die Hände neuer Interessenten und Investoren und wurden somit unter das Volk gestreut.\n\nViele Startups, gesteuert von unerfahrenen Geschäftsleuten, schafften es nicht durch das Jahr 2015 und mussten ihre Pforten schließen. Das in 2014 investierte Risikokapital reicht nicht ein Leben lang, besonders nicht dann wenn man es nicht aus eigener Kraft schafft einen ausreichenden Umsatz zu generieren. Dies war bei vielen Unternehmen 2015 der Fall und es trennte sich allmählich die Spreu vom Weizen.\n\nUm eine Vorstellung davon zu bekommen in welch ernster Lage sich manche Bitcoin-Unternehmen befinden habe ich mich mit einem Manager unterhalten, der mit einem Bitcoin-Unternehmen eine Partnerschaft eingehen wollte. Irgendwann gab der Geschäftsführer des Bitcoin-Unternehmens zu: “Du weißt, wir befinden uns in einer Phase in der wir ernsthaft überlegen, ob wir unser Unternehmen weiterführen sollen.”\n\nMittlerweile werfen auch viele private Hobbyminer zu Gunsten der großen Mining-Farmen das Handtuch, da die Schwierigkeit zu hoch wird und die Einnahmen den Kostenaufwand nicht mehr decken können. Die Mining-Farmen haben oftmals einen geografischen Vorteil mit einem kühleren Klima zwecks der Chip-Kühlung oder aber zahlen ein Vielfaches weniger an Stromkosten. Aufgrund einer neueren Generation von Mining-Chips stieg die Hashrate von 300 auf mehr als 600 Petahash.\n\nDer derzeit niedrige Preis hat aber auch eine positive Eigenschaft – die Massenakzeptanz ist in 2015 stetig gestiegen und die das Transaktionsvolumen liegt derzeit bei rund 3 Transaktionen pro Sekunde (das Netzwerk kann derzeit maximal 5-7 Transaktionen verarbeiten). Im Sommer entfachte aufgrund der natürlichen Transaktionsbeschränkung eine heiße Debatte die bis zur Hong Kong Scaling Konferenz im Dezember anhielt. Hier entstand der Anschein eines Konsens, wenn vielleicht auch nur zum Teil: “Es geht hier nicht um Bitcoin, es geht um die Blockchain.”\n\nDie Idee, das Bitcoin vielleicht zu volatil und zu radikal für die Finanzwelt sein mag, fordern zunehmend mehr Institutionen private und formbare Blockchains mit eigenen Token.\n\nNeun Banken, darunter Goldman Sachs und Barclays kündigten bereits eine “Blockchain-Partnerschaft” an. IBM hat bereits damit begonnen einen Blockchain ohne Bitcoin-Anwendungen zu entwickeln und unterstützt diverse Blockchain Projekte: Ethereum (15 Mio USD), Chain (30 Mio USD) und Ripple Labs (32 Mio USD).\n\nGoogle Trends: “Blockchain” (blau) gegenüber “Sidechain” (rot) – das Interesse an “Blockchain” weist ein 9 mal höheres Suchvolumen auf.\n\nAm 9. Juni veröffentlichte ein Unternehmen namens Blockstream den ersten Open-Source Code für “Sidechains”, eine Technologie die es erlaubt Bitcoins von der Blockchain in eine Sidechain zu transferieren von wo aus sie mit neuen Funktionen wie High-Speed Transaktionen, Smart Contracts oder für die Aktienausgabe ausgestattet werden können.\n\nDie Technologie erlangte zunehmend mehr Berücksichtigung in der Presse und der Preis pro BTC durchbrach schließlich am 27. Oktober den Widerstand bei 300 US-Dollar. Daraufhin wurde des mediale Interesse weiter durch die angebliche Identifizierung des Bitcoin-Gründers befeuert und die Preis-Rallye nahm weiter ihren Lauf jenseits der 400 Dollar Marke.\n\nWelches Potential birgt das Jahr 2016?\n\nHier meine Einschätzung für das Jahr 2016:\n\n1. Das Bitcoin Netzwerk wird sich skalieren\n\nNach monatelangen Diskussionen wird es in 2016 eine Entscheidung für die zukünftige Skalierung von Bitcoin geben.\n\nEs liegen bereits umsichtige und effektive Vorschläge auf dem Tisch, wie z.B. Pieter Wuille’s ‘Segregated Witness’ und Adam Back’s BIP248.\n\nIch denke einige vorgeschlagene Lösungen werden bis zum Sommer implementiert sein.\n\n2. Bitcoin wird als sicheres Anlagegut glänzen\n\nIch erwarte erneut hohe Volatilität an den globalen Marktplätzen und infolge dessen denke ich wird es unerwartete Liquiditätsprobleme geben.\n\nAls Resultat werden Investoren nach Anlegegütern mit niedrigem Gegenparteirisiko suchen. Ich denke Bitcoin Bitcoin wird eines dieser Anlegegüter sein, noch mehr als bereits in den vergangenen Jahren.\n\n3. Sidechains werden sich als technischer Durchbruch erweisen\n\nÄhnlich wie sich Bitcoin gegen die Vorwürfe eines Schneeballsystems wehren musste, werden sich die Sidechains der Skepsis und dem Misstrauen stellen müssen.\n\nDa immer mehr Sidechains auf den Markt kommen und sie dank der Open-Source Technologie für die ganze Welt sichtbar sein werden, wird sich die öffentliche Wahrnehmung zum Besseren entwickeln.\n\n4. Rohstoffgiganten werden sich am Bitcoin-Mining beteiligen\n\nKonfrontiert mit einem Bärenmarkt, was auf eine sinkende Nachfrage an Strom hinweist, werden einige Rohstoff-Unternehmen Partnerschaften mit Bitcoin Unternehmen eingehen und ihnen eine physische Infrastruktur anbieten – damit werden Bitcoin Transaktionen in den wohl unfruchtbarsten Regionen der Welt abgewickelt und verwaltet werden.\n\n5. Das Bitcoin Überweisungsnetzwerk wird weiter gestärkt\n\nDie Bitcoin Börsen werden auf internationaler Ebene näher aneinander rücken und die Installation von mehr Bitcoin-Automaten und die Entwicklung von Bitcoin freundliche Überweisung-Anwendungen werden zunehmend mehr Menschen dazu animieren, ihre Gelder mittels Bitcoin in ihre Heimatländer zu transferieren.\n\nSollten die hohe Volatilität an den Währungsmärkten weiterhin anhalten und mehr Kontrollen eingeführt werden, wird auch das die Bitcoin-Überweisung weiter vorantreiben.\n\n6. Das Bitcoin Block-Halving wird sich positiv auf den Preis auswirken\n\nMitte Juli 2016 wird sich die Anzahl gemeinter Bitcoins von derzeit 3.600 BTC auf 1.800 BTC pro Tag halbieren.\n\nDamit wird der jährliche Zufluss von Bitcoin-Geldmittel von 9.17% auf 4.09% fallen. Die Miner haben nur noch begrenzten Einfluss auf den Markt. Zuvor konnten sie mit dem Angebot frisch gemeinter Coins den Markt stärker beeinflussen.\n\nIch denke wenn alles so bleibt wie es derzeit ist, wird sich das Bitcoin Halving 2016 positiv auf den Preis auswirken.\n\n7. Investoren werden überrascht sein\n\nIn jedem Jahr in dem ich in Bitcoin involviert war, war ich schockiert und erstaunt zugleich.\n\nIn der Bitcoin-Community stellen die Entwickler beinahe täglich neue Lösungen vor und der globale Wettbewerb nimmt von Jahr zu nah weiterhin zu. Investoren sind nicht selten unerfahren und angespannt und auch die Banken und Regierungen werden zunehmend unruhig.\n\nDie Bitcoin Technologie ist gerade einmal sieben Jahre alt und Bitcoins als finanzielles Anlagegut gerade einmal fünf Jahre. Wenn ich irgendetwas über die nächsten 12 Monate ganz sicher erwarte, dann ist es überschaut zu werden.\n\nDas ist auch der Grund warum ich den oben genannten Prognosen eine Wahrscheinlichkeit von 75% zuspreche.\n\nEs scheint als wenn 2016 ein unglaubliches Jahr für Bitcoin wird – vielleicht wird es auch das Jahr, in dem auch die letzten Investoren einsehen werden, dass sie Bitcoin nicht ungeachtet davon ziehen lassen können\n\nFolge Tuur Demeester auf Twitter.\n\nBTC-Echo\n\nEnglische Originalfassung von Tour Demeester via Coindesk\n\nImage Source: Fotolia\n\nÜber Mark Preuss Mark Preuss ist Gründer und Geschäftsführer von BTC-ECHO.\n\nNach seinem Wirtschaftsstudium in den Niederlanden und in China führten ihn verschiedene berufliche Stationen im Finanzwesen zunächst in die Schweiz und schließlich nach Düsseldorf.

12/30/2015,"['“A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” This is the opening sentence of the abstract of Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. With this, the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, came into existence in 2008.\n\nSince then, bitcoin has been under the microscope. However, it has survived despite being criticized, rebutted, banned, all the while developing a core following of supporters. The responses towards bitcoin have been mixed - sometimes more negative than positive - but amid the skepticism, its underlying technology started to gain attention. Thus, bitcoin not only paved the way for a cryptocurrency revolution, but it also brought with it an intriguing technology which runs it - the blockchain.\n\nWhile blockchain has been introduced by bitcoin, the fact that it can be used independent of it has created enthusiasm to experiment and work on this great innovation. Blockchain works on ‘distributed ledger technology,’ which slices out the need of a neutral authority to check or certify ownership to clear transactions which reduces the transaction time, offers high speed and makes records meddle-proof. The figure seen further below shows how the working of a blockchain.\n\nProjects & Endorsements\n\nThe year 2015 saw a substantial rise in blockchains’ fan-following from financial institutions, banks to technology firms. In fact, it has received an overwhelming response from a group, which doesn’t stand bitcoin one bit but is sure in love with blockchain. No points for guessing the group: big banks.\n\nOne of the most-talked-about projects involving banks has been the distributive ledger initiative by R3CEV, an innovation firm that has gathered the support of around 42 big banks. “R3 has long-believed that distributed ledger technology has the potential to impact the financial services sector the way the Internet changed media and entertainment,” said David Rutter. “Yes, that’s a big statement, but there is increasing evidence to support it.”\n\n(Source: World Economic Forum, Financial Times)\n\nAnother recent development has been the formation the Open Ledger Project, which would work on customized distributed ledger systems among other things. It is a cohort, which includes names like International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), London Stock Exchange Group Plc., Accenture Plc. (ACN), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), Digital Asset, Intel Corporation (INTC), VMware, Inc. (VMW) and few more along with the not-for-profit Linux Foundation. The Digital Asset Holdings, which is a part of this project, had made headlines earlier during the year when former JP Morgan executive Blythe Masters got associated with the start-up, which aims at reducing settlement latency and counterparty risk.\n\nThe year also witnessed many individual ventures by financial institutions and banks. In July this year, International Business Times reported that, “Citibank have constructed three blockchains and a test currency to run across them.” It further quoted Ken Moore, head of Citi Innovation Labs, ""We also have an equivalent to bitcoin up and running, again within the labs, so we can mine what we call a \'CitiCoin\', for want of a better term. It\'s in the labs, but it\'s to make sure we are at the leading edge of this technology and that we can exploit the opportunities within it.""\n\nThen there has been Goldman Sachs development of SETLcoin and Securities Settlement Patent. According to the application entitled “Cryptographic Currency for Securities Settlement,” Goldman Sachs is seeking patent protection for a settlement system for securities market based on cryptographic currency protocol, which introduces its own cryptographic currency - the SETLcoin.\n\nEurope Visa’s Why 2015 was the year of payments highlights the importance of bitcoin and the blockchain technology. It read, “2015 has turned blockchain into something the industry has to live with. It is no longer a choice anymore. Recent news speculating about the identity of its creator and the formalisation of virtual money as a commodity, just makes it more real than ever before.”\n\nIn May this year, Nasdaq made a buzz as it announced its debut blockchain-enabled platform - Nasdaq Linq. The project ‘Nasdaq Linq’ was developed by the company\'s in-house technologists in collaboration with blockchain technology provider Chain.com and human-centric, user experience contributions from award- winning global design and innovation firm IDEO according to the press release.\n\nIn October, Nasdaq made the first-ever demonstration of its blockchain technology at the Money 20/20 event, names like Chain.com, ChangeTip, PeerNova, Synack, Tango and Vera were on the initial roster of private company clients for Nasdaq Linq. According to Bob Greifeld, CEO, Nasdaq, ""Blockchain applied to the private market is innovation built on top of innovation, and carries with it the opportunity to forever alter the future of financial services infrastructure.”\n\nWhile Russia continues to be extremely wary of cryptocurrencies, there has been news about the country’s largest bank Sberbank keen joining the R3CEV initiative, which is a consortium of the biggest international banks working on the blockchain technology. In another development, President Putin even received a proposal to provide for a blockchain regulation from the Internet Development Institute of Russia.\n\nEven India’s apex bank, the Reserve bank of India (RBI), which had issued a warning regarding cryptocurrencies two years ago, seems to be charmed by the blockchain technology. According to a report by the RBI, “With its potential to fight counterfeiting, the ‘blockchain’ is likely to bring about a major transformation in the functioning of financial markets, collateral identification (land records for instance) and payments’ system.” It further said, “Regulators and authorities need to keep pace with developments as many of the world’s largest banks are said to be supporting a joint effort for setting up of ‘private blockchain’ and building an industry-wide platform for standardising the use of the technology, which has the potential to transform the functioning of the back offices of banks, increase the speed and cost efficiency in payment systems and trade finance.”\n\nWhile institutions and companies understand the technology well and have been working on projects openly (and secretly), it was The Economist cover story titled as “The promise of the blockchain: The trust machine” that introduced blockchain to an average audience it in a very positive manner.\n\nWhy It Matters to Investors, and What Lies Ahead?\n\nBlockchain adoption can facilitate a high-speed, low-cost and efficient payment system, thereby resulting in huge savings for both banks and customers. The use of the blockchain technology could make the acceptance of ‘smart contracts’ possible, which can be used in areas that involve counter party risk, like trade finance, securities, swap, derivatives and more. Its use can reduce the trade settlement time to near spontaneous.\n\nIt can further provide a tamper-proof system, which eliminates the need of constant monitoring while increasing the accuracy in execution of transactions at the same time. Overall, investors can look to benefit from the technology in the form of reduced costs, faster speed, better accuracy and more transparency. All these combined together would increase the investor confidence in products and processes of the financial world.\n\nFinal Word\n\nThe blockchain technology is at stage where it is widely believed that its true potential is only partially known. This is one reason why it is often compared to the era when internet was first invented. How many actually knew how internet would be shaping our lives many years later? Blockchain is just the start of another era, the benefits of which would be discovered in time.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'Richelle Ross is an independent cryptocurrency consultant and a computer science major at the University of Florida, whose interests include programming and cryptology.\n\nOn 23rd July, I predicted on Quora that the price of bitcoin at the end of the year would rest around $420.\n\nIt appears at press time that I was not far off. As of 30th December, the bitcoin price is around $425. It seems I identified what many in the cryptocurrency community were predicting – 2015 was the year the bitcoin price would experience the slow and steadier growth it needed.\n\nIn previous years there were a lot of unknowns in the cryptocurrency world. It was often believed that a better currency may come along or that bitcoin was just another form of the fabled \'Tulip Mania\', a period in the Dutch Golden Age used as an example for when the price of an asset outpaces its intrinsic value.\n\nAnd these concerns were real possibilities because bitcoin was new, and there were growing pains it had to overcome.\n\nInstitutional acceptance\n\nThis year we learned that bitcoin is probably not going away anytime soon, as evidenced by the continued rise in transaction volumes and legitimization from mainstream leaders and institutions.\n\nLarry Summers, Blythe Masters and UK Chancellor George Osborne have all given approving statements on bitcoin or the blockchain.\n\nNot only are the statements positive, though, they\'re increasingly bullish. For example, Summers, the head of US Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration, said he is behind the technology as he wanted to side with the ""history of change"".\n\nElsewhere, everyone from politicians to musicians was seeking to find new and novel ways to use and support the technology.\n\nUS presidential candidate Rand Paul began accepting bitcoin donations, becoming the first presidential candidate to do so, and indie songstress Imogen Heap released a song on the blockchain.\n\nThe list goes on: Patrick Byrne’s blockchain-backed stock platform was recently approved by the SEC; Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss launched their long-awaited exchange Gemini; more bitcoin investment vehicles have been started; the Coinbase service reached 3 million users; and bitcoin startup funding surged to total almost $1bn all-time.\n\nMaturing conversation\n\nAnalyzing the bitcoin economy for the last couple years, I have been fascinated by the evolution of conversations between bitcoin skeptics and evangelists. But it\'s easy to forget how it used to be nearly impossible to read a bitcoin article without it featuring sources labelling it a Ponzi scheme or scam and an evangelist who claimed bitcoin’s price was going ""to the moon"" next week.\n\nBut, we’ve moved beyond these simplistic sides this year.\n\nNow, the debate centers more on whether bitcoin can maintain its values and whether there will be a role for private or independent blockchains in a decentralized financial technology stack.\n\nIn essence, bitcoin is being discussed with more complexity and the pessimistic voices trying to write obituaries are dying out.\n\nWhenever I’ve spoken to colleagues about bitcoin, what usually intrigues them is the global payment rail system.\n\nIt parallels the trends we see in communication and cloud networking – nation states are becoming less relevant to younger generations with global systems like the Internet, and that conversation came into the spotlight this year.\n\nReasons for optimism\n\nAssuming that bitcoin remains the most popular token to run the blockchain and transaction volumes continue to rise, the next few years should be spectacular for the price of bitcoin.\n\nWhile 2015 was a relatively calm year for the price, it seems likely that 2016 will be much more action-packed with the block halving next summer, where the amount of bitcoins awarded to miners roughly every 10 minutes will be cut in half.\n\nWe’ve laid down the tracks so to speak, allowing for there to be more confidence than ever before that bitcoin is, and can continue to be, a credible store of value.\n\nWith this in mind, I’ve decided to offer another price prediction for next year since I had some luck for this year. I believe bitcoin will surpass $500 by the middle of the year and average out to a $650 price range in the second half of the year.\n\nOf course, there are too many unknown factors when predicting price to know with any certainty, but the maturing infrastructure has lead me to believe that next year will be an exciting one for investors.\n\nStill, many of bitcoin’s best days come in reaction to world crises in places like Greece, China, and Argentina, meaning at the end of the day, there\'s no predicting where the price could go.\n\nAs we continue to patch up leaks in the global economy’s sinking ship, I have to wonder will 2016 also be the year we are reminded of why Satoshi created bitcoin in the first place.\n\nWant to share your opinion on bitcoin or blockchain in 2015, or a prediction for the year ahead?

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', ""Bitcoin is one of the most interesting algorithmic experiments ever. It has a unique mix of clever procedures designed to stop cheating, however it is difficult to say if they are effective, not because of technology but psychology. Now we seem to be entering a new phase with hardware good enough to take control of the entire protocol.\n\nOne of the many interesting things about the bitcoin algorithm is the use of a proof of work mechanism to pick in a random style the agent that gets to validate a block to be added to the block chain. To remind you of what proof of work is all about:\n\nbitcoin miners compete for the right to validate a block of transactions. To do this they have to add data to the transactions to make a hash function, SHA-256, work out to a given value when applied to the block.\n\nOne of the interesting things about this particular proof of work task is that its difficulty can be adjusted by setting the target value. Every two weeks or so the difficulty is adjusted to keep the average time for the task at about 10 minutes.\n\nNow consider the implications of this very simple idea. The miners are all competing to be first and they are rewarded with some new bitcoins when they are successful. This creates an arms race with miners trying to improve their mining techniques so that they get there first.\n\nMostly the improvements have been to the hardware that miners use. Back in the early days of bitcoin you could mine a block using a desktop PC, then you needed a GPU to have a chance of making a profit. Currently dedicated, custom-built mining, machines are your only hope and you need a data center full of them.\n\nWhat this means is that the difficulty has increased fairly steadily over the life of bitcoin. Suddenly, however, the difficulty has jumped by over 40% in one month.\n\nThe reason is most likely due to a new mining operation - BitFury - starting to function. BitFury is using a new mining ASIC, a custom chip, to compute the hash. Its new data center is a state of the art facility with liquid-cooled machines to cram in as much hardware as possible. It is estimated to have cost $100 million and is located in the Eastern European country of Georgia in a special state-created technology zone. It makes use of 20M watts of power when mining at full capacity.\n\nIt seems likely that BitFury's data center also has the capacity to go beyond the 50% mining capacity needed to make bitcoin vulnerable ot central control. The theory is that as long as no single miner commands 50% of the mining power then bitcoin cannot be manipulated in ways that are dishonest. The reason for this is that with less than 50% mining power no miner can be sure enough of completing the very next block to be able to pervert the ledger.\n\nThe point is that proof of work keeps bitcoin decentralized and under no one miner's control. If one miner has more than 50% then bitcoin immediately changes its status to a centrally administered ledger.\n\nThis seems like a clear cut sort of situation, but in practice it isn't.\n\nFor example, bitcoin enthusiasts argue about exactly what a dishonest miner would do with their centralized control? Most often the suggestion is that they could arrange for double spending of the same bitcoin. There are many other suggestions, including blocking the processing of transactions from particular sources unless a higher transaction fee is paid.\n\nHowever, what is clear is that it is difficult to predict what a controlling miner would do to maximize their profits.\n\nMany argue that the whole situation is one something like Mutually Assured Destruction - any miner tempted to be dishonest, controlling or not, would wipe out their profit by destroying any confidence in the currency.\n\nThere is also the point that a more than 50% control is almost certainly going to be a temporary situation. The reason is simply that mining is an arms race. With the other miners' incomes reduced by BitFury's success they will have to invest to continue to make a profit. It is also clear that BitFury has set the going rate for buying 50% of the mining resources - $100 million is all you need.\n\nThere is one small worry. Over time the number of bitcoins provided as payment reduces - and it is set to halve sometime in 2016. As the mining payment reduces, the incentive for the arms war reduces. In theory the miners can start charging a transaction fee to make up for the lost bitcoin, but it isn't clear how this is going to work out. One thing is clear the transition will reveal the true cost of mining.\n\nMore Information\n\nhttp://bitfury.com/\n\nRelated Articles\n\nLinux Foundation Backs Blockchain Project\n\nbitcoin MOOC On Coursera\n\nbitcoin Course Offered Free Online\n\nbitcoin Fork Due To Algorithmic Differences\n\nbitcoin Isn't As Anonymous As You Might Hope\n\nThe True Cost Of Bugs - bitcoin Errors\n\nInside bitcoin - virtual currency\n\nTo be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus"", 'Martin Arnold in London and Nicole Bullock in New York DECEMBER 30, 2015 3 Nasdaq claims to have broken new ground on use of blockchain with a share sale on Wednesday that used a system based on the technology. The blockchain is the shared database technology that initially gained notoriety as the platform for bitcoin and other crypto currencies. But many large financial groups are now seeking to use its technology to make payment systems and capital market transactions faster and cheaper. It works as an electronic ledger of digital events that uses cryptography to continuously verify “blocks” of records and then distribute them among parties to the transactions. The enthusiasm around blockchain on Wall Street has been so intense that Nasdaq’s announcement prompted a scuffle over who owns the bragging rights to the first share sale using blockchain. Nasdaq said Chain.com, a privately owned company that itself specialises in blockchain technology, had issued shares to a private investor using the US exchange’s new Linq system that is based on the digital ledger technology. The exchange group said the transaction had created a digital record of share ownership — “significantly reducing settlement time and eliminating the need for paper stock certificates”. It also allowed the issuer and investor to complete and execute share subscription documents online. Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, said: “We believe this successful transaction marks a major advance in the global financial sector and represents a seminal moment in the application of blockchain technology.” But Symbiont, a start-up backed by trading veterans including Duncan Niederauer, the previous chief executive of the rival New York Stock Exchange, hit back, claiming it issued the first securities using blockchain technology in August. Symbiont issued its own shares using the bitcoin blockchain while a privately held company used Nasdaq’s proprietary blockchain network to sell shares to a private investor. Nasdaq said the blockchain technology could significantly speed up the clearing and settlement of equity trades from the existing standard of three days in the US and two days in Europe to as little as 10 minutes. Big Read Technology: Banks seek the key to blockchain Financial groups race to harness the power of the bitcoin infrastructure to slash costs Supporters of blockchain technology argue that near-instantaneous settlement of transactions can transform the financial system by automating the clunky back offices of banks. This could also free up billions of dollars that banks and others must hold as collateral to insure against things going wrong while a trade is being settled. However, despite a plethora of industry consortiums, no widely used financial product has yet been switched to blockchain technology. Mr Greifeld said: “Through this initial application of blockchain technology, we begin a process that could revolutionise the core of capital markets infrastructure systems. The implications for settlement and outdated administrative functions are profound.” The technology could cut banks’ infrastructure costs for cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by $15bn-$20bn a year from 2022, according to a recent report by Spanish bank Santander, management consultancy Oliver Wyman and venture capital investor Anthemis. Other groups are also turning their attention to bitcoin and its technology. The NYSE this year launched the first exchange-calculated and distributed bitcoin index. In January, NYSE made a minority investment in Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet and platform. Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker who helped develop the idea behind credit default swaps, has joined a group of trading executives who have set up company called Digital Asset Holdings. It sells software using the underlying blockchain technology to improve the settlement time and cost of transactions for financial institutions and other market participants.* *An earlier version of this story misstated the nature of Digital Asset Holdings.', 'Jad Mubaslat is the founder and CEO of BitQuick.co, the Ohio State Bitcoin Group, a former graduate of Boost VC and a bitcoin user since 2011. BitQuick.co is a P2P marketplace that allows individuals to buy and sell bitcoins in the US via cash deposit.\n\nNearing the end of 2015, many are questioning the future of bitcoin. 2016, it\'s safe to say, will be a crucial 12-month period.\n\nFor one, the technology\'s open-source community will need to resolve some outstanding questions, most notably whether it will increase the size of blocks on the blockchain. Meanwhile it must combat the effects of ""private blockchains"" seeking to court market share.\n\nUltimately, I am a firm believer in the future of bitcoin. While its progress throughout 2015 may not have captured the media’s attention as it did in 2013, the industry has created a solid foundation for the continued success and growth of the bitcoin network.\n\nWith the variety of applications now being built, it is difficult to imagine it simply fading away anytime soon. I truly believe we are only a few years away from bitcoin crossing ‘the chasm’ and becoming a ubiquitously acknowledged technology.\n\nBut the big question remains: Which use case will first bring about bitcoin’s wider acknowledgement?\n\nWith this in the background, here are the five companies that I believe will have a considerable impact on the industry this coming year.\n\nBlockstream\n\nOne of the more well-funded startups, Blockstream is nonetheless a self-described ‘stealth bitcoin company’ working on accelerating the development of cryptocurrency, open asset and smart contact technology.\n\nThe company has been busy in the background, launching a beta of its banner sidechains project and announcing its first commercial product, Liquid, which is aimed at speeding up transfer times between bitcoin exchanges, in 2015.\n\nOne of the projects that Blockstream has decided to explore further is the Lightning Network – a proposal that would move smaller bitcoin transactions off the blockchain so they could occur more quickly with reduced fees. It nonetheless recreates the trustless nature of the current network design.\n\nThe Lightning Network has the ability to reduce the total number of transactions that need to be settled on the bitcoin blockchain, and thus removes their affect on the necessary total size of blocks.\n\nThe network faces technical challenges before it can go live, though, such as the integration of various changes to Bitcoin Core. I believe we will see most of these issues resolved and that Blockstream, or perhaps even a different party, will launch its version of Lightning during 2016.\n\nThis will greatly relieve the current buildup of pressure surrounding the block size discussion, and add to the robustness of the bitcoin network.\n\ntØ\n\ntØ is a blockchain-based trading platform created by online retail giant Overstock, first announced in August. Part of the firm’s larger Medici arm, tØ aims to revolutionise securities by making trade and settlement occur simultaneously using blockchain technology.\n\nWhile the SEC did recently approve Overstock’s plan to issue stock via blockchain technology, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said in a recent article by Motherboard that it might not use the bitcoin blockchain as part of its efforts.\n\n""Maybe we\'re not going to use the bitcoin blockchain ... Maybe there\'s another blockchain we want to integrate with, with higher throughput,"" he told the news source.\n\nThis comment is in reference to the bitcoin block size, as a limited number of transactions also results in a limited number of instant settlements the company can offer.\n\nContinuing with my belief that the block size issue will be addressed during 2016 in some way, I also believe tØ will utilise the bitcoin blockchain as opposed to a private blockchain due to bitcoin’s decentralised, secure and relatively trustless nature.\n\nIf this comes about, this would be the first major security settlement product released that utilises bitcoin, and a key milestone in bitcoin’s history.\n\nOpenBazaar\n\nOpenBazaar is currently working on one of the most compelling consumer applications for bitcoin out there with the development of a decentralised marketplace.\n\nIf successful, OpenBazaar would essentially serve as an open-source competitor to eBay that has reduced fees for all parties due to its decentralised nature.\n\nOpenBazaar faces what I believe to be relatively trivial challenges in launching, including the development of a robust reputation system and the classic chicken-and-egg problem of acquiring volume in a new marketplace.\n\nHowever, with its recent venture capital fundraise of $1m in June 2015, I believe we will see the highly anticipated launch and expansion of OpenBazaar during 2016.\n\nZapchain\n\nZapchain is a social media platform powered by bitcoin and is one of my personal favourite companies.\n\nThe startup’s integration of on-chain bitcoin micropayments for tipping is a truly revolutionary idea that fosters high-quality user engagement and content creation amongst various self-created communities.\n\nZapchain’s biggest hurdle lies in its ability to continue its growth, while avoiding spam users.\n\nFrom what I have seen of Zapchain, though, its ability to curb spammers has proved effective and the platform is currently more popular than ever.\n\nDuring 2016, I predict Zapchain will continue its growth in non-bitcoin related communities and also become recognised as a top bitcoin news platform. Zapchain embodies the spirit of bitcoin, and also provides a key alternative to some controversially moderated bitcoin communities.\n\nBitFury\n\nThe best-funded bitcoin mining company with over $60m raised so far, BitFury announced on 16th December that it will bring a new ASIC chip to market in Q1 2016.\n\nThe launch of its new data centre in Georgia could double the total bitcoin network hashing rate, leading some to worry about the integrity of bitcoin’s mining decentralisation.\n\nI believe this risk is perhaps overstated and that the major net effect of BitFury\'s innovations will be increased (and possibly almost doubled) security for the network.\n\nFurthermore, affecting the integrity of bitcoin’s decentralised nature would act against BitFury’s best interests as a bitcoin company.\n\nBitFury CEO, Valery Vavilov, has also reflected this sentiment, suggesting his company intends to act in the interests of the network as a whole.\n\nWant to share your opinion on bitcoin or blockchain in 2015, or a prediction for the year ahead?

He’s the one offering the hacker-esque prize, and he got the idea last year when he was at an awards event at the school’s College of Technology, and not one award was related to CNS.\n\n“There were several (awards) for mobile apps and game design and graphics — but nothing for the lowly hacker,” Rhoades quipped.\n\nThe winner, announced sometime this spring, will be a CNS student who “best exemplifies a passion for the cyber security profession” by presenting a portfolio of extracurricular cybersecurity work from the past school year. The winner will be chosen by the university.\n\nThe school is calling it the “CNS Passion for the Profession Award,” but Rhoades thinks that lacks pizzazz. He instead refers to it as the “Elite Award,” or “31337 Award” (hence the $313.37 prize amount).\n\nRhoades, who will begin teaching an ethical hacking course at Wilmington University in January, acknowledges bitcoin might not be the preferred currency for students. “Some of these (computer and network security) majors are just looking to get into the field, not … off running Nigerian scams or anything like that,” he said.\n\nSo, there’s good news for students — Rhoades said there’s some fine print to the bitcoin rules that U.S. traveler’s checks will also be an option.', 'In an effort to foster further development of blockchain technology, WanXiang Blockchain Labs, a Chinese research institution, and Deloitte, one of the largest accounting and audit firms in the world, have teamed up to launch the first ever Shanghai blockchain hackathon beginning on January 8th.\n\n“Our focus on how technology and going digital are changing the ways we live is globally orchestrated.

12/31/2015,"[""This is the last article in a three-part series on whether or not Bitcoin makes a good investment. Read the first, detailing 10 arguments in favor, here, and the second, outlining 10 against, here.\n\nDisclosure: I own a small number of Bitcoin.\n\nAn investment in Bitcoin, as outlined in the first article in this series, could potentially result in an enormous payoff, which is perhaps why it has attracted such fervent supporters. But as discussed in the second installment, the currency has many paths to failure. If you are willing to take a gamble, you must decide how to invest.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is a technology as well as money, you can own it in a way where you manage the tech yourself or you can have someone else handle it for you. You can also own other investment vehicles that give you exposure to Bitcoin but shield you from the currency’s volatility and that allow you to benefit from tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.\n\nHere are the different ways you might buy, invest in and store Bitcoin, plus guidance on how to choose between them.\n\nIf You’re Tech-Savvy, Go With A User-Controlled Wallet\n\nBitcoin was created by a computer program that produces a Bitcoin address (or addresses) for each entity that holds some of the currency. The owner of each address is given a “private key” that enable bitcoins to be sent out from it. Since Bitcoin Core was launched in 2009, a number of new apps have launched. Many, like the original software, are “user-controlled wallets” that have users manage their own private keys. But new services referred to as “hosted wallets” take care of private keys for their users.\n\nThose who feel comfortable with technology might prefer a user-controlled wallet, which is more similar to digital cash and offers greater privacy and doesn't require the user to trust any third parties. If you go this route, you have full control over your money, but that comes with its own dangers: you could lose your private keys, your computer could be hacked and the keys could be stolen, or your computer could break, and if you did not keep another record of your keys, you’d be out of luck.\n\nUser-controlled wallets can come in desktop, mobile or web apps, and for desktop, these fall into two main types: full node and simplified payment verification (SPV), a k a lightweight, wallets. Bitcoin Core is a full node client, meaning it will also load the full blockchain, the entire record of every transaction ever made in Bitcoin, onto your computer. The file is currently 51,000 MB, will take at least a couple days to download and in general will use up a lot of memory, unless you use dedicated hardware for running a full node, such as Bitseed. (Check out the costs of running Bitcoin Core here.)\n\nIf you would like a computer program, but don’t want to commit to using up all that space and memory on your computer, you can try a lightweight client such as Electrum. Bitcoin.org lists a number of options, along with their pros and cons, here.\n\nYou can also go with a phone wallet (which also will not download the entire Bitcoin blockchain) which is much easier to use to pay for items when you are out and about, making it seem even more like digital cash. Blockchain and Mycelium (Android) both offer user-controlled mobile wallets.\n\nBecause of the greater likelihood that you could misplace your phone or have it stolen, you should be sure to back up your wallet and keep it in a separate place so that if you do lose your mobile, you can re-create your wallet on your new device. This chart breaks down the pros and cons of various mobile wallets according to features like privacy, security and control of your keys.\n\nIf You Want A User-Friendly Experience, Go With A Hosted Wallet\n\nHosted wallets, which are managed by a third party that will take care of your private keys for you, offer a user experience, usually via the web and a mobile app, similar to that of online bank accounts. But you need to find one with whom you feel comfortable entrusting your Bitcoin, because the company could choose to withhold your funds from you or get hacked and lose your keys. Also be aware that, for at least some transactions, you may be giving up the ability to directly access your Bitcoin and see it on the blockchain or verify it. For instance, if you have a Coinbase wallet and you send a small amount of money to another Coinbase wallet, it may not be viewable on the public blockchain.\n\nTo increase security, choose a service that offers two-factor authentication with Google Authenticator or a device such as a Yubikey. (Avoid using your phone number as that second factor at all costs, as hackers are stealing million in crypto assets using phone numbers.) In addition to wallets, which are used for everyday transactions, many of these services also offer vaults or “cold storage,” in which the keys to your Bitcoin (usually Bitcoin that you’re holding for an investment) are kept on computers not connected to the Internet, similar to a savings account or safety deposit box. Some of the most popular hosted wallet services are Circle, Coinbase and Xapo.\n\nIf You're Concerned About Security, Go With A Multisig Service, Vault Or Hardware Wallet\n\nIf you fear losing your Bitcoin one way or another, you have a few options, depending on what your greatest fear is and what risks you’re willing to take.\n\nIf you’re not totally comfortable giving a third party complete control over your Bitcoin, but you also don’t trust yourself to not lose your private keys, you can go with a hybrid option — a company that offers multi-signature transactions. With such transactions, you usually do not have to hold all your keys yourself but you also don’t have to entirely trust the company.\n\nThe way it works is, instead of having one private key authorize a Bitcoin transaction, several keys are associated with that address, and a certain number of those keys (say, two out of three or three out of five) must be signed before money can be sent out of that address. It’s similar to how company checks above a certain dollar amount require signatures from multiple executives or employees in order to be valid. However, you don’t always have to give your second key to a different person. For instance, at Coinbase, you keep one key and then the second key requires you to enter a password. BitGo is the most established multisig wallet, and Coinbase offers a multisig vault.\n\nAs mentioned above, using a vault to store your Bitcoin is also highly secure, though doing so means you have to trust a third party. Plus, you will not be able to access your funds immediately. Xapo, in particular, is known for its cold storage services for investors.\n\nIf you want to retain control of your keys but are concerned with security issues that come with being on the Internet, such as hacking or malware, go with a hardware wallet, which is a small device built specifically for holding your Bitcoin public and private keys. Usually, the size of a USB stick or smaller, they are not connected to the Internet but can be plugged in to a computer from where the user can conduct transactions. They also do not reveal private keys on the computer, so even a hacker or key-logging malware would still not be able to access your Bitcoin. Some hardware wallets include LedgerWallet, Trezor, and KeepKey.\n\nHow To Obtain Bitcoin\n\nIf you have a user-controlled wallet, you could buy some Bitcoin through services like Coinbase, Circle, itBit, Gemini and other exchanges, which enable you to link your bank account. You could also buy some at a Bitcoin ATM or on a local exchange such as Local Bitcoins or Mycelium Local Trader where you can arrange to meet up with someone who has Bitcoin and then trade your dollars (or other currency) for their Bitcoin.\n\nHosted wallets make it easy for you by connecting to the traditional banking system, enabling you to buy Bitcoin through ACH, wire transfer or even check.\n\nIf You Want Exposure in Your Portfolio, Go With Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC)\n\nIf you don’t plan on spending actual bitcoins and want to use an investment vehicle that can be held in a tax-advantaged investment account with designated beneficiaries (and that can’t be lost the way that actual Bitcoin can), for now, you can buy GBTC, a trust that gives investors Bitcoin exposure in a traditional security. (Soon, there will also be an ETF.) Modeled after the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, GBTC is a publicly traded security invested in Bitcoin, with each share of GBTC representing one-tenth of a bitcoin, tied daily at 4pm to the Bitcoin market price. Sponsored by Grayscale Investments, GBTC can be held in IRA, Roth IRA, 401(k) and other brokerage and investment accounts.\n\nAccredited investors can purchase shares directly from the issuer, but those come with resale and transfer limitations. Accredited and nonaccredited investors can purchase GBTC, which is freely tradable on OTCQX, through their IRA, Roth IRA and other brokerage and investment accounts.\n\nThis is the last article in a three-part series on whether or not Bitcoin makes a good investment. Read the first, detailing 10 arguments in favor, here, and the second, outlining 10 against, here.\n\nSunday, August 6, 2017: This article has been updated to state that securing your bitcoins on a third-party service using two-factor authentication via phone number is extremely insecure and the second factor should be a device such as a Yubikey or an app such as Google Authenticator."", 'Nasdaq has trumpeted a recent share transaction as the first-ever private securities issuance documented with a blockchain, the technology that underpins crypto-currencies like bitcoin.\n\nThe exchange announced on Dec. 30 that it used its blockchain-powered platform, Linq, to allow a startup called Chain to sell shares to an unnamed private technology investor in the US.\n\nBut the Linq transaction looks like a bit of PR-posturing from the exchange. For starters, it probably isn’t the first time a company’s share transactions were recorded on a blockchain. As the Financial Times pointed out, Symbiont, a startup backed by former New York Stock Exchange chief executive Duncan Niederauer, issued its own shares on the bitcoin blockchain on Aug. 4.\n\nIn September, Digital Asset Holdings, led by former JPMorgan bigwig Blythe Masters, also used blockchain tech to enable a startup called Pivit to distribute shares to investors. Nasdaq is unfazed by these precedents. “This is the first-ever private securities issuance documented with blockchain technology and we stand by this view,” Nasdaq spokesman Ryan Wells told Quartz.\n\nBlockchains promise to cut out a lot of the administrative costs and paperwork that’s currently required when private companies want to distribute shares. That’s because a blockchain is a shared ledger that all the parties in a transaction maintain, which cuts out the need for manual work, like mailing paper-share certificates and updating individual ledgers. That’s why so many firms are experimenting with the technology’s potential to sharply reduce securities settlement times.\n\nBut there’s a bit more bluster to cut through in Nasdaq’s claim. Chain, the company that sold its shares, is also the technology vendor that helped build the Linq platform. This isn’t mentioned in Nasdaq’s latest release, although it was announced in June. “Chain is a blockchain developer and worked hand-in-hand with Nasdaq as we created the technology,” Wells said.\n\nNasdaq’s blockchain transaction, then, is starting to look more like a technology vendor testing its product and less like a milestone on the road to a financial technology revolution.', 'The volatility of the bitcoin price has resulted around 50% loss for high profile and established investors and traders who purchased the shares of publicly traded bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) like Grayscale Investment’s Bitcoin Investment Trust.\n\nHowever, due to the underwhelming performance of stock markets and equities and the rising trend of bitcoin price, an increasing number of investors are beginning to recognize bitcoin as a viable retirement portfolio asset.\n\nOver the last few days, the value of public equities and precious metals including gold have plummeted, with market favorites like Apple falling by 14.5%, the price of gold plunging by 12.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping by around 3% since May 2015.\n\nDespite such poor performance of the public market, the value of bitcoin etfs such as Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC) has surged by around 133% since the beginning of the year, surpassing the growth rate of many publicly traded market favorites in established stock exchanges.\n\nAccording to the financial data provided by OTC Markets, the share price of GBTC has increased from US$45 to US$63 per share, marking a 28.5% monthly increase. Each share of Bitcoin Investment Trust guarantees the ownership of one tenth (10%) of a bitcoin. Thus, investors are currently trading bitcoin at an average price of US$630 per bitcoin on public markets.\n\nAt the time of writing, bitcoin is being traded at around US$421 at prominent bitcoin exchanges including BitFinex and Chinese exchanges such as OKCoin. Which means, investors are purchasing bitcoin for nearly 33.2% higher than average.\n\nDue to this valuation of bitcoin in the public market, many investors are advising individuals with retirement portfolios to include bitcoin as one of the main assets, as it will increase in value as time goes by. Some investors have begun to allocate over 10% of their retirement portfolios for bitcoin, expecting the price of bitcoin to reach a new all-time high in mid-2016.', 'It\'s been another formative year in the world of bitcoin and the blockchain, and while the price has been subdued over much of the year, other developments in the space have arguably been more intriguing than in any 12-month period previously.\n\nWe\'ve seen companies come and go, record-setting funding rounds, increased interest in the technology and, sadly, occasional bad actors still stirring negativity into the mix.\n\nIn this year-end special, we look back at the news stories that made the most impact during 2015.\n\n1. Bitstamp Claims $5 Million Lost in Hot Wallet Hack\n\nThe year got off to a shocking start on 5th January when bitcoin exchange Bitstamp released a statement admitting that it had suffered a major hack and lost ""less than 19,000 BTC"", or about $5.1m at the time.\n\nIn a statement, Bitstamp said an undisclosed number of wallets had been compromised, and that upon learning of the breach, it had issued warnings to users and moved to suspend operations.\n\nA report, supposedly leaked from the exchange, later suggested that six Bitstamp employees had been targeted over some weeks in a phishing attempt that led to the theft. Eventually, the hackers were able to access two servers containing the file for Bitstamp’s hot wallet and it passphrase.\n\nFollowing the attack, the exchange put in place multi-sig wallet access and contracted bitcoin security firm Xapo to handle its cold wallet storage.\n\nHowever, the incident still served to set the tone for what would be a bleak first half of the year for the industry as a whole, particularly for exchanges, which struggled to find revenues amid increased competition and lower-than-expected user adoption.\n\n2. Megabank Joins Coinbase\'s Record $75 Million Funding Round\n\nLater in January, wallet and exchange provider Coinbase announced that it had raised $75m as part of a Series C funding round – smashing the previous record for a bitcoin company.\n\nAsides from the figures, the backers were equally impressive.\n\nThe round included a host of impressive first-time bitcoin investors including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Fortune 500 financial services group USAA, Spanish megabank BBVA and Japanese telcom giant DoCoMo. Former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer also contributed personal investments.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong suggested at the time that the funding would help shift the mainstream perception of bitcoin during what had so far been a rocky year for the industry.\n\nArmstrong told CoinDesk:\n\n""I think this just really changes the conversation. There’s smart money out there that is betting big on this and is totally unphased by the whims of the price and what the market is doing. They’re much more concerned about the fundamentals of what’s happening in the network ... and across those metrics, everything is looking great.""\n\nWhile the fundamentals of the network would continue to be debated, Armstrong was on the money with his prediction about funding, with the round serving as the opening salvo for what would be a year marked by a substantial increase in interest from financial incumbents.\n\n3. Bitcoin Startup 21 Announces $116 Million All-Star Backing\n\nThe Wall Street Journal published a scoop in March, revealing that stealth startup 21 Inc had raised $116m in funding, a figure that served to put Coinbase\'s $75m January round, at least temporarily, in the shade.\n\n21 Inc\'s then-CEO Matthew Pauker indicated at the time that Andreessen Horowitz, Data Collective, Khosla Ventures, RRE Ventures and Yuan Capital were among the firms that invested in the company.\n\nQualcomm Ventures also participated, as did Dropbox CEO Drew Houston and Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus.\n\nWhat many missed in all the excitement, however, was that the impressive figure had been raised over multiple funding rounds dating back likely as far as 2013.\n\nThe news was all the more mysterious since the California-based company was still not yet publicizing its business plans.\n\nObservers at the time said chip-maker Qualcomm\'s involvement was a likely sign that mobile technologies could be at the heart of 21\'s endeavour, but the big reveal was to come later in the year.\n\n4. Former JP Morgan Exec Blythe Masters Swaps Wall Street for Bitcoin\n\nMarch brought further interesting news, when former JP Morgan exec Blythe Masters took a chief executive role at bitcoin trading platform Digital Assets Holdings (DA).\n\nIn a statement to the Wall Street Journal, the commodities veteran suggested that blockchain technology could restore confidence and trust in the financial markets, sentiments that would soon find her becoming the veritable figurehead for the rising interest use cases for bitcoin\'s distributed ledger, the blockchain.\n\nMasters, who had previously been head of global commodities at JP Morgan Chase, told the WSJ at the time:\n\n""Digital Assets has a revolutionary technology platform that eliminates the counterparty risk and lack of transparency that has hindered mainstream adoption of cryptographic technology. The possibilities for reducing cost and risk in settlement are enormous.""\n\nIn the months since, Masters has become known for her work promoting blockchain tech to Wall Street execs, and has turned down an offer from Barclays to stay at DA.\n\nStill, it was ultimately a mixed year for the DA team, with reports asserting the startup is struggling to raise funding while criticizing the strength of its technical product.\n\n5. Former White House Advisor to Head MIT Digital Currency Initiative\n\nApril saw MIT Media Lab announce the launch of Digital Currency Initiative, a three-pronged program aimed at increasing awareness of the technology on campus while providing research to promote policy and standards initiatives.\n\nThe news was embellished by the fact that it was to be led by former White House senior advisor Brian Forde, who had previously worked with the administration of President Barack Obama.\n\nForde explained at the time how the Digital Currency Initiative would seek to address questions regarding the technology\'s security, scalability and privacy, while convening governments and nonprofits ""to research and test concepts"" related to its use.\n\nSoon after, Bitcoin Core developers Gavin Andresen, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields joined the project, at a time when their previous financial supporter, the Bitcoin Foundation, was undergoing financial difficulties.\n\nBrian Forde said the move would help bring stability to development team, something he suggested had been lacking in recent years as the foundation had been rocked by scandals.\n\n6. Nasdaq Becomes Latest Firm to Trial Blockchain Technology\n\nLater in April, global stock market giant Nasdaq went public with its explorations into how a blockchain solutions could change the way shares are transferred and sold.\n\nWhile Nasdaq was simply ""the latest"" big financial group to advertise its interest at the time, it would soon become the most prolific in terms of stoking public interest in its blockchain R&D.\n\nThe company would later reveal it was trialling the technology in Nasdaq Private Market, a capital marketplace launched in January 2014, eventually debuting the proof-of-concept at Money 20/20 in November of that year.\n\nIn subsequent interviews, Nasdaq has hinted that it is exploring more use cases for the technology and that its interest is only in its infancy.\n\nThis enthusiasm also appears to be present throughout the organization, with Nasdaq chief executive Robert Greifeld even telling The Wall Street Journal:\n\n""Utilising the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities.""\n\n7. Silk Road Operator Ross Ulbricht Sentenced to Life in Prison\n\nOn 29th May, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the operation of Silk Road, the now-defunct online dark market.\n\nThe sentence was handed down by US District Judge Katherine Forrest in New York, capping roughly a year and a half-long legal process that saw multiple bitcoin auctions and the shock indictment of two federal agents involved in the investigation.\n\nIn addition to the prison term, Ulbricht was ordered to pay $183.9m to the federal government, an amount tied to proceeds related to the operation of Silk Road.\n\nUlbricht, who ran the marketplace under the name Dread Pirate Roberts, was convicted in February on seven charges related to narcotics distribution, computer hacking and conspiracy.\n\nThe severity of the sentencing quickly set off a firestorm of comment and criticism, with debates centering on the alleged hypocrisy of the federal government and the morality of its handling of illicit Internet crime in context of its actions against the traditional financial sector.\n\nSuch criticisms, however, were interspersed with live drama, as standing outside of a New York courthouse, Lyn Ulbricht voiced concern for her son Ross Ulbricht’s safety as he left for a maximum security prison.\n\n8. Is Greece Really Behind Bitcoin\'s Latest Price Surge?\n\nAfter months of relative calm, the price of bitcoin spiked to a relative high of $257 on 17th June.\n\nSome in the community sought to tie the market movement to the fact that that Greece was, at the time, likely to default on its debt obligations and exit the eurozone (the \'Grexit\' as it had been dubbed).\n\nThe international press seized on the claims, but were the two actually linked?\n\nThe narrative was not a new one for the bitcoin space, given that digital currencies are one of the few assets that can act as a hedge against fiat currency fluctuation. Similarly, many in the bitcoin community had correlated the rising interest in bitcoin in 2013 with severe economic issues in Cyprus, past precedent that gave momentum to the theory.\n\nHowever, many prominent members of the bitcoin space had doubts that any real links existed between the two situations, and that Greeks were unlikely to turn to bitcoin as a safe-haven asset.\n\nUK Digital Currency Association board member Paul Gordon suggested at the time, while a convenient narrative, there was little evidence to suggest the timing was anything but coincidental or that activity in Greece is actually at the root of the movement.\n\nOthers startups took advantage of the attention, with firms like Coinbase seeking to advertise their services more intently to Greek users.\n\n9. New York Releases Final BitLicense\n\nAfter more than a year of waiting, the bitcoin and blockchain industry finally saw the passage of the first state-specific licensing regime for digital currencies in June.\n\nThe long-controversial regulation was nonetheless heralded as a major milestone among major financial news outlets, one that precipitated a slew of other important developments.\n\nSoon after, bitcoin exchanges itBit and Gemini launched services in New York, though they did so with banking charters rather than BitLicenses. Later, Circle Internet Financial secured what has been to date, the only license issued in the state.\n\nElsewhere, there was a predictable series of events with bitcoin companies pulling out of New York, blaming the costs of compliance.\n\nSince then, technology advocates have continued to argue the law was still too restrictive for a nascent industry, prompting other US states to take different paths to regulating the industry.\n\nFollowing its passage, California and North Carolina have both started, and shelved, plans to introduce similar measures.\n\n10. Bitcoin \'Forked\' in Controversial Bid to Resolve Scalability Question\n\nMid-August saw a controversial attempt to resolve the fiery bitcoin scalability debate, when two of bitcoin\'s best-known developers – Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn – \'forked\' a version of the software that helps run the network.\n\nThe changes to Bitcoin XT (a patch that sits over Bitcoin Core) were written as a way to \'opt out\' of bitcoin\'s 1MB block size limit, which currently limits the number of transactions that can be processed by the digital currency\'s mining network roughly every 10 minutes.\n\nWithout change, the network can handle around 3-7 transactions per second on a sustained basis, and the average by mid-June had been 1.2 t/s. However, that\'s not to say there wasn\'t impetus for action.\n\nImpromptu stress tests had demonstrated that by overloading the network with high numbers of transactions, it was possible to cause significant delays in transaction confirmation.\n\nReaching the so-called \'capacity cliff\' (when transactions exceed the capacity of the network) could either create a competitive market for transaction fees or destroy the robustness of the network completely, depending on who you ask.\n\nIncreasing bitcoin\'s block size – a \'quick fix\' for the issue – carries its own long-term implications for the network, which some argued would make the network more centralised and, thus, less trusted.\n\nWhile anyone can run XT, the new rules will only be triggered when 75% of bitcoin miners have done so. In effect, it was a novel way to let people actually using and supporting the network vote on the matter.\n\nThere were numerous critics of the changes, however. Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, for one, said at the time that the standard 95% threshold for soft-forks was chosen for good safety engineering reasons, and that 75% was ""very low"".\n\nPieter Wuille, another Core developer, told CoinDesk he also had concerns:\n\n""People not being able to send coins from one \'side\' of the fork to another, and all coins that existed before the fork being able to be spent twice (once on every side of the fork) [is] the very thing that bitcoin was designed to prevent.""\n\n\'Theymos\', moderator of Reddit\'s r/bitcoin forum, even banned talk of XT claiming that as a fork of Bitcoin Core, XT should be classed as an \'altcoin\' or a \'forkcoin\', similar to litecoin.\n\n11. Visa, Capital One Back $30 Million Round for Blockchain Startup Chain\n\nOn 9th September, startup Chain announced it had raised $30m in new funding from investors including Visa, Capital One and Fiserv – an impressive figure that revealed the growing recognition of the advantages of blockchain technology.\n\nFrench telecom giant Orange SA contributed to the round, as did Nasdaq, which has been working with Chain, and Citi Ventures.\n\nThe funding all but cemented Chain as the company to watch in the industry, as it had seemingly found a viable business model at a time when many startups were struggling to earn revenues amid declining interest in bitcoin trading.\n\nChain would go on to debut four proofs-of-concept at big-box financial conference Money 20/20, all but stealing the show from its competition.\n\n12. Inside R3CEV\'s Plot to Bring Distributed Ledgers to Wall Street\n\nFirst outed by CoinDesk for its ambitions to build a blockchain consortium in July, it was tough at first to tell how successful R3 would be at enlisting enterprise organizations in its work.\n\nWas it an R&D workshop? A consultancy? Or would it be offering a product of its own? While R3\'s exact strategy is still a bit unclear, what\'s not is that it will have tremendous support from financial incumbents.\n\nThe turn of the tide came in mid-September nine major investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, partnered with the startup. Many on the list had previously announced independent efforts to study blockchain tech, and the banks were said to be investing money in R3 as part of the effort.\n\nLate September saw 13 more banks sign up – including Citi, HSBC and Bank of America Chase – followed by BNP Paribas, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, ING, MacQuarie and Wells Fargo in November, and another 12 in December that included Banco Santander.\n\nIn total, R3 now says 42 of the world\'s banks have joined the group.\n\n13. Amazon Starts Shipping 21 Bitcoin Computers\n\nThe mysterious and extremely well-funded bitcoin startup 21 Inc made an official announcement for its upcoming bitcoin product in May, stating at the time that its market strategy would focus on distributing bitcoin mining chips embedded in consumer and enterprise hardware devices.\n\nHowever, it wasn\'t until late September that it finally started accepting pre-orders for an actual consumer device – the 21 Bitcoin Computer – and 16th November that it actually went on general sale on Amazon.\n\nRetailing for $399.99, the 21 Bitcoin Computer includes a custom mining chip, a datacenter backend and a custom Linux-based operating system.\n\nThe firm made it clear that it did not intend for its units, which contribute to transaction processing on the bitcoin blockchain, to be tools for speculative bitcoin mining. Instead, the units were aimed to provide a ""stream of bitcoins"" for use in apps and services.\n\n21 Inc, however, struggled somewhat to communicate the product\'s advantages even to its target consumers in the development community, and as of the end of 2015, seemed intent on relying on word-of-mouth advertising to propel its project rather than more expensive or articulate advertising campaigns.\n\n14. Reports Claim Satoshi Nakamoto Might Be 44-Year-Old Australian\n\nReports from Wired and Gizmodo on the 9th December shocked the bitcoin world with claims that they had possibly identified the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, as Australian entrepreneur Craig S Wright.\n\nDave Kleiman, a US computer forensics expert who passed away in 2013, was also said to have been significantly involved in the development of the digital currency.\n\nAccording to Wright\'s LinkedIn account, he has worked with a series of companies including Hotwire Pre-Emptive Intelligence Group – the firm behind an effort to create a bitcoin-based bank called Denariuz and later ran into problems with the Australian Tax Office.\n\nIn its exposé, Wired cited ""an anonymous source close to Wright"" who provided a cache of emails, transcripts and other documents that pointed to Wright\'s role in the creation of bitcoin.\n\nGizmodo, meanwhile, said it had been provided with a cache of documents, which it had corroborated in interviews, from someone claiming to have hacked Wright’s business email account.\n\nWired presented its evidence with caution, raising the possibility that the information might have been fabricated – perhaps even by Wright himself, and other news outlets soon began picking apart the story\'s inconsistencies.\n\nStill, the idea that the Wright \'revelations\' are nothing but a hoax has been aired by other observers, though the compelling nature of the published evidence will no doubt fuel speculation for some time to come.\n\nWhat were your biggest stories of 2015?

Due to a lack of alternative clients and problems with software dependencies, they decided to redo the Bitcoin software in a modular way, with high test coverage and thorough documentation as a platform for those who want to further develop Bitcoin or fork the software in the future. Today, their software - called btcsuite - powers the technology of several organizations, has served as the foundation that many new ideas choose to build on such as Ethereum\\\'s most popular software client, and enjoys improvement to its code on a daily basis. After three years of activity, the group has announced a new digital currency that will draw on their experiences in the Bitcoin ecosystem and expertise in software development - in a collective effort to address longstanding issues in Bitcoin.\n\nEnter Decred. A digital currency that will attempt to shift the traditional dominance that proof-of-work miners have over the network to a more harmonious relationship with other users of the software. It is through this relationship between miners and users that Decred believes an environment is created that makes sustainable funding for the development of the software possible. ""A consensus rule supported by miners and users that makes funds available for the development of the software through its use frees current and future developers from obligations to outside parties and keeps them beholden only to their userbase. If users are unhappy with development, they finally have a means to communicate their discontent in a way that has effect through a vote in the blockchain. This sets the stage for a system of community-based open governance directly connected to developers"", said Jake Yocom-Piatt, CEO at Company 0, who has funded development of btcsuite since early 2013.\n\nDecred has started an ""airdrop"" initiative whereby future users with an interest in contributing to the ideas and technology of the project are encouraged to sign up and join the network to receive decred unconditionally in an effort to spread the starting network far and wide among interested parties. ""In the future, this project envisions a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship where advances in Decred and Bitcoin run in parallel and learn from each other, as we are now in a position to expand development on both software packages. We believe in this future and are actively working on making it a reality - alternative is not a bad word"", said Dr. John Vernaleo, a Decred developer. The project\'s website at www.decred.org contains additional information.\n\nhttps://www.decred.org/\n\nThe publication of a press release on this page should not be viewed as an endorsement by CoinDesk. Customers should do their own research before investing funds in any company.', 'Compared to the United States, Europe is always ahead in terms of adopting the latest payment and financial technologies. In 2014, The Guardian reported that America is ‘a decade behind Europe’ in terms of adopting the chip and pin cards that have reduced data theft, due to the former’s strict regulatory rules. Today, European countries, especially the Netherlands, are keen to adopt the latest fintech.\n\nIn this post, we want to highlight the latest payment and financial technologies implemented by banks and businesses in the Netherlands.\n\nContact and contactless machines\n\nAccording to the information shared by Worldpay, countertop payment terminals remain the ‘most widely used payment method’ by most businesses and retailers worldwide. These machines are also able to accept contactless payments that reduce customer waiting time as well as process requests faster and more secure.\n\nApart from the countertop machines, here are the other kinds of card machines that businesses leverage:\n\n1. Portable card machines\n\n2. Mobile card machines\n\n3. Contactless payments\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies\n\nIn June 2015, Cryptocoinnews reported about International Monetary Fund (IMF) Director Christine Lagarde’s thoughts on Bitcoin and its groundbreaking technology. Lagarde said that banks and financial institutions shouldn’t worry about Bitcoin, Blockchain, and other cryptocurrencies – rather they should challenge them to strengthen their security processes, to offer people the most secure and fastest peer-to-peer currency exchange. Three Dutch banks (ING, ABN Amro, and Rabobank) have already announced that they are experimenting with Bitcoin and its technology as a way to improve their payment systems. But, many banks and financial organizations remain cautious when it comes to accepting the cryptocurreny as issues regarding its security remain a hotly debated topic.\n\nVoice-activated online banking\n\nWe all know what Siri can do, but now a Dutch bank has announced their latest innovation for online banking that allows users to access their digital bank accounts through voice activation. ING Netherlands released their new mobile banking app that comes with voice-activated log-in to fight banking fraud. In a featured post from the Daily Mail, the same application will also have an option to use the fingerprint recognition (Touch ID) on Apple devices.\n\n“Thanks in part to the inclusion of biometric applications, we are able to make banking faster, smoother and easier for our customers and improve access,” said ING internet & mobile marketing manager Jeroen Losekoot. “This allows them to have greater control over their finances.”\n\nThe Netherlands remains one of the top adopters of financial technologies, not only in Europe but also across the world. New fintech innovations are set to initiate huge developments in the financial industry. What other financial technologies do you expect to see next year?\n\nPhoto Credit: antanacoins via Compfight cc', 'The number of developers and users of the Stack Exchange, a collaborative Q&A platform for developers, has decreased substantially, due to its lack of incentive for freelance programmers. To properly incentivize developers and solution providers of the network, a group of engineers have launched Synapsi, a blockchain-powered knowledge market.\n\n“We believe Synapsi offers a solution to any platform where users want to provide incentives for high-priority questions and issues,” Ken Miyoshi of Synapsi told Joseph Young in an exclusive interview.\n\n“Users can now attach bounties to questions on Stack Exchange as an incentive to developers who may prefer bitcoin over reputation. Our initial focus is integrating with GitHub and enabling users to contribute and collect bitcoins for bugs, feature requests and resolving issues,” he added.\n\nThe Synapsi implements multi-signature technology to allow users to deposit BTC while posting a question on the platform. The deposit of the user and the multi-sig implementation creates a unique escrow account between Synapsi, user and the developer who answers the question.\n\nAs soon as the user confirms and validates the answer provided by a developer, the funds are released by Synapsi.\n\n“Synapsi uses a 2-of-2 multi-signature implementation where Synapsi and the user asking the question are both required to sign the transaction. This creates a unique escrow arrangement that allows the user to credibly commit to making payment while giving Synapsi only negative control over funds. Users can directly pay to the best response or to multiple responses or request a refund if there is no satisfactory response,” explained Miyoshi.\n\nInstead of using altcoins or alternative blockchains to speed up the verification process, the Synapsi team decided to implement the bitcoin network due to its ability to process microtransactions with low transaction fees. Furthermore, there are no blockchains today which provide the same level of security that the bitcoin blockchain offers.\n\n“While bitcoin is currently well-suited for micro-transactions because transaction fees are low, Synapsi enables users to offer incentives for more specific and more valuable information. We also think bitcoin is the ideal currency for the platform because it’s secure, open and inclusive,” continued Miyoshi.\n\nMonetization\n\nCurrently, the Synapsi platform takes comission fees from users only after the questions are answered and users are paid. It charges no other fees apart from this small management fee to sustain the business and manage its team of engineers.\n\nBecause the Synapsi platform uses the multi-sig technology, most of the processes are completed autonomously. However, the Synpasi team may raise capital later on to further improve the platform and expand its team of engineers and developers.\n\n“Synapsi is designed to be a sustainable business by charging a commission only when questions are answered and users are paid. We don’t currently plan to take investments but we may raise capital depending on our strategy,” concluded Miyoshi.', 'Trögt i porten för insektsmat\n\nInsekter må vara framtidens föda – men de är fortfarande sällsynta på tallrikarna. Sedan vi skrev om saken i våras har myndigheterna stängt två nätbutiker, varav en i Göteborg.\n\nDet har talats mycket om insekter som proteinkälla, inte minst sedan FN-rapport 2013 pekade ut dem som en lösning på hungerproblemen. Men det är fortfarande förbjudet att sälja insekter som människoföda i Sverige och de flesta EU-länder.\n\nPå sensommaren stoppade miljöförvaltningen i Göteborg firman Hakuna mat, som sålde bland annat mjölmask och gräshoppor. En planerad provsmakning vid Malmöfestivalen ställdes också in. Någon månad senare tvingades företaget Qvicket i Stockholm sluta sälja mjöl och knäckebröd tillverkade av malda syrsor.\n\nNya regler kan vara på väg, säger Zofia Kurowska, statsinspektör vid Livsmedelsverket.\n\n- Det som har hänt senast är att Efsa (EU:s livsmedelsmyndighet) har kommit med en riskprofil om insekter. De har rett ut vilka risker som finns när det gäller till exempel allergier, hygien och miljö. Sedan följer vi noga ett ärende i Frankrike där ett företag kommer att ansöka om att få producera sådan mat.\n\nHär i Sverige har ovan nämnda Qvicket sökt tillstånd att få sälja sina insektsvaror. Beslutet ser dock ut att dröja.\n\n- Vi behöver nya riktlinjer från Efsa, de kan komma nästa sommar. Vår uppgift är att konsumenterna ska få säker mat. Vi godkänner inte någonting förhastat, säger Zofia Kurowska.\n\nDryga böter hotar tandborstbolag\n\nMyndigheterna tar i med hårdhandskarna mot INT förbrukningsartiklar, det lilla företaget i Jönköping som har varit en av årets värsta konsumentplågor. Nu hotar mångmiljonböter.\n\nFirman drivs av en 24-årig man i Jönköping som säljer tandborstar under namnet Dental clean och nyckelbrickor under namnet Nyckelhittaren Jönköping. Vi skrev om honom i augusti – hans då helt nystartade verksamhet toppade listan över sommarens mest KO-anmälda bolag.\n\nSedan dess har klagomålen fortsatt. Ett stort antal kunder berättar om falska löften och räkningar som anlänt utan att de beställt något, ibland utan att de ens talat med företaget. Firman har fått 106 KO-anmälningar samt minst 120 polisanmälningar sedan i juni.\n\nI november stämde Konsumentombudsmannen bolaget i tingsrätten. I december kom ett interimistiskt beslut, där INT förbrukningsartiklar och dess ägare förbjuds att vilseleda kunderna vid vite av upp till fyra miljoner kronor per vecka. Bolaget åläggs att informera om säljsamtalens syfte, om att deras ""gratiserbjudanden"" är kopplade till abonnemang samt om ångerrätten. Dessutom måste de genast sluta skicka ut obeställda varor.\n\n- Så kallade löpande viten är något som vi yrkar vid de grövsta överträdelserna, företag som fortsätter med otillbörliga metoder trots tidigare uppmaningar, säger Gunnar Wikström som är processråd hos KO.\n\nSamtidigt utreds polisanmälningarna av bedrägeriroteln i Jönköping. Det är ännu oklart om 24-åringen kommer att åtalas.\n\n- Det är dumheter han håller på med. Människor har blivit lurade. Frågan är om det går att styrka brottsligt uppsåt, säger förundersökningsledaren Niclas Abrahamsson.\n\n24-åringen har tidigare skyllt överträdelserna på sina före detta anställda och har uppgivit att företaget ""växte för fort"". När konsumentredaktionen ringde upp honom höstas lade han på luren.\n\nInga spår efter Iphone-skojaren\n\nI augusti betalade den 37-årige göteborgaren Markus 4 500 kronor för en Iphone 6 som visade sig vara en plastkopia. Polisen har inte hittat bedragaren.\n\n- Det har inte hänt något. Polisen verkar inte komma någon vart, säger han.\n\nBluffen var grundligt genomförd med Blocket-annons, förfalskat kvitto, inplastad kartong och falskt IMEI-nummer (mobilens unika id-nummer). För Markus sved det extra mycket eftersom telefonen var en 60-årspresent till hans mamma.\n\n- Besvikelsen lagt sig men den finns kvar. Jag försöker att inte tänka på det. Jag lärde mig en läxa men den var inte billig, säger han.\n\nDenna sorts bedrägerier har varit vanliga under året. Polisens råd är att helst inte köpa mobiler privat och, om man ändå gör det, att bryta förpackningen på plats och kontrollera produkten.\n\nI oktober dömdes en 23-årig Malmöbo för mer än 50 Iphone-bedrägerier runt om i Sverige, bland annat i Göteborg, Kungälv och Halmstad. Tillvägagångssättet var till stora delar likadant men 23-åringen har inte kunnat kopplas till bedrägeriet mot Markus.\n\nNya stämningar mot bitcoinbolag\n\nKunderna som känner sig lurade av bitcoinbolaget KNC miner fick inget stöd av Allmänna reklamationsnämnden. Nu väntar rättegång.\n\nFöretaget sålde dyra specialdatorer (cirka 80 000 kronor styck) som skulle användas för att utvinna bitcoin och andra digitala valutor. Maskinerna blev kraftigt försenade, ibland var de trasiga eller kom aldrig överhuvudtaget. KNC Miner vägrade ersätta kunderna.\n\nEtt 40-tal personer vände sig till ARN. Nu har nämnden avvisat anmälningarna – inte för att bolaget gjorde rätt, utan för att den som utvinner bitcoin räknas som företagare och därför inte kan få sin tvist prövad hos ARN.\n\nEn av anmälarna är en 31-årig göteborgare som vi intervjuade i våras. Han betalade 81 000 kronor för en maskin som kom en och en halv månad efter utlovad tid. 31-åringen ville häva köpet, dels på grund av förseningen och dels för att flera likadana maskiner börjat brinna.\n\n- Beskedet från ARN överraskade mig. Jag trodde det skulle bli ett annat beslut. Jag har inte bestämt hur jag ska gå vidare, säger han i dag.\n\nSamtidigt har 54 personer stämt företaget i tingsrätten för att få sina pengar tillbaka. Antalet kommer att öka, uppger deras advokat Magnus Daar.\n\n- Inom kort lämnar vi in en ny grupptalan mot KNC Miner med ett 50-tal svenska och utländska deltagare.\n\nFöretagets vd Sam Cole hävdar i ett mejl till konsumentredaktionen att ""vi har uppfyllt vad vi lovat i fråga om leveranstider"" och att ""vissa av våra kunder har varit ute efter att göra snabba klipp"". Han förnekar att datorerna skulle vara brandfarliga.\n\nKNC Miner säljer inte längre datorer men driver en serverhall i Boden. Bolaget gick med stor förlust under andra halvåret 2014; resultatet var minus 66 miljoner kronor på en omsättning av 194 miljoner.', 'Sinds de introductie van de Bitcoin heeft deze virtuele valuta zich een eigen plek veroverd in de tech-economie. Vooral de laatste drie jaar groeit het gebruik van de munt razendsnel. Bitcoins worden ook steeds meer gebruikt door durfinvesteerders in tech startups.\n\nSinds de introductie in 2009 en vooral de laatste drie jaar is de ontwikkeling van de Bitcoin stormachtig te noemen. Wisselkantoren kunnen inmiddels groeicijfers tot meer dan 80 procent overleggen. Veelzeggend is ook de positie in vergelijking met andere elektronische betaaldiensten. Bitcoin neemt inmiddels de derde positie in. Vergelijken we de groei echter met PayPal dan zien we stagnatie in de laatste tegen spectaculaire groei .\n\nBitcoin blijkt zeer aantrekkelijk voor durfinvesteerders in (vooral) tech startups. We zien dat er elk jaar in nieuwe landen geïnvesteerd wordt.\n\nWaar kan je met de bitcoin terecht? De markt wordt steeds breder en is beslist niet meer beperkt tot tech of games. Opmerkelijke sectoren zijn onder andere voedsel, medische marihuana en edelmetalen. Ook non-profit organisatie als Wikipedia maken dankbaar gebruik van de bitcoin.\n\nHet profiel van Bitcoin gebruikers laat een opvallend feit zien: meer dan 90 procent van de gebruikers is man. Hier is dus nog een groot onontgonnen terrein. Ook de Bitcoinmiljonairs is een mannenclub. Onder hen natuurlijk de onbekende, mysterieuze oprichter, Satoshi Nakamoto. Of misschien is dit een groep oprichters, niemand weet het.\n\nTot slot een korte blik op wat de toekomst bieden gaat: steeds meer bitcoins op straat, uit pinautomaten. Ook andere virtuele munten groeien goed in bitcoin’s schaduw. Regulering en hackers kunnen bedreigingen vormen, maar voorlopig is de bitcoin niet te stuiten.', 'DECENT is an autonomous decentralized system owned by its users. The DECENT platform allows media sharing by guaranteeing to its users the right to freely express themselves. Matej Michalko, the Startup’s Co-founder and CEO says the company’s end goal is to give access to borderless data and information streams while maintaining a strategic distance from control, restriction or any outsider impact.\n\nDECENT created a distributed and secure publishing platform to allow users to freely and anonymously share their content while being able to monetize it. DECENT is liberating the world of media by enabling decentralized sharing of digital content. The project’s aim is to eliminate all political and geographical barriers so that people around the world can freely express themselves without any restrictions.\n\nThe DECENT platform is anonymous; all the players are identified exclusively by their ID and protected by advanced cryptography. However, the users also have the option to be associated with given content. Focused on freedom of speech and expression, the platform provides unlimited access to information for everyone in the world.\n\nDECENT provides open-source software that enables users to share unlimited virtual content; the company’s main goal is to give a chance to individuals whose voice is normally controlled. DECENT combines a micropayment framework with solid encryption, giving a whole new level of privacy to its users—the DECENT platform only allows for authorized users to access the content. The platform operates via a P2P network, and DECENT’s platform is not centrally hosted, so the data cannot be manipulated and they can never be blocked.\n\nNewsBTC had a meeting with Matej Michalko, one of the company’s co-founders and CEO, where he was more than happy to tell us all about DECENT.\n\nNewsBTC – DECENT is introducing a new decentralized and anonymous P2P platform that allows users to freely share their content without any restrictions. What can you tell us about DECENT, and how did you come up with the idea for this new Platform?\n\nMatej – I’ve been familiar with Bitcoin since 2012. I have been a miner since 2012 and have organized bitcoin and cryptocurrency conferences all over the world. I’m the founder of BitcoinExpo and Bitcoin 2 Business Congress series, that had its chapters twice in London, Vienna, Shanghai, and Brussels. I also founded the first Crypto Digital Marketing Agency – BitcoinMarkerting in the world helping new cryptocurrency companies to get to the market.\n\nHence, I understand the immense potential the Blockchain technology has; it can be applied to many different domains. I also observed that the world of media is dominated by oligopolies of big players and that there is a lack of free publishing platforms that would transform the current market dominated by oligopolies into a perfectly competitive one. Currently, the biggest players on the market charge about 60% for e-book distribution.\n\nThe poor writers have only about 40% of the amount their readers pay. For instance, if they sell 10,000 books worth $20 each, they get only $80,000 instead of the $200,000 they could have when publishing with DECENT. There was a market need for a free P2P digital content distribution platform: all for the benefits of authors (writers, bloggers, musicians, video makers, …) and content consumers (readers, listeners, viewers, …).\n\nNewsBTC – What can you tell us about the DECENT team?\n\nMatej – I co-founded DECENT with Matej Boda, who was cooperating with me on the BitcoinExpo series. Moreover, our team consists of ex-Ericsson architect Josef Sevcik and well-known blockchain cryptographer Pavel Kravchenko. Our online presence is secured thanks to Martin Polacek and Sandra Wantrubova, and our Europe office is up and running thanks to Jana P. Bodova. We have secured a decent presence in China, mainly thanks to Xiaomin Wang and Weiwu Zhang.\n\nNewsBTC – What can you tell us about the company roadmap, aims and goals?\n\nMatej – The DECENT Protocol is developed and maintained by a Swiss-based foundation. The roadmap for 2016 is the following:\n\n\n\nWe are planning a crowdsale of DECENT in Q1 2016 for the financing of the development and initial distribution of DCT tokens that will power the network.\n\nSo far, there is a prototype with an API and a proof of concept available, that will be described soon in a video published at DECENT. Besides developing DECENT’s core, we are planning to make a lot of updates including security fixes and many other developments.\n\nNewsBTC – Can you tell us all about the platform, and how does it work?\n\nMatej – DECENT was designed with principles of functional decomposition. We have developed three independent layers, each serving specific functions:\n\nThe data distribution layer, which is used for storing and sharing huge amounts of user-generated content. The blockchain, where all the transactions and contracts happen in a publicly verifiable manner. Also, the blockchain is used for storing permanent data. Those are buying transactions, publishing transactions, ratings, etc.\n\nAnd the recommendation layer, which consists of a set of independent recommendation engines, helping the consumer to select the most relevant content. From a user’s perspective, there are three roles the user can have:\n\nThe Author—the author creates new content and publishes it on the network.\n\nThe Content Consumer—the Content Consumer reads, watches, listens or otherwise consumes the content created by the authors.\n\nThe Publisher and Miner. The publisher plays a vital role in the network: the publisher stores the content created by the author and distributes it to the consumers. The miner verifies the transactions and realizes payment distribution, and therefore is responsible for the consistency of the network.\n\nThe interaction and flow principles are as follows:\n\nAuthors can set the price for the content. Only users who paid the price set by the author can access the content. On the other hand, the payment will be processed only if the user verifiably received the content.\n\nThe Author pays the Publisher for acting as a storage and content distribution network. The payment will be released over time to motivate the publisher to keep the content as long as required. The payment for network storage is also an effective anti-spam mechanism.\n\nConsumers can rate the content. These ratings can be used for various purposes, e.g. assuming content quality, author’s reputation or by recommendation engines. 100% of the payment for the content goes to the author. There are no network or processing fees. The Author and Consumer can remain fully anonymous if they want to.\n\nNewsBTC – Do you have any partnerships?\n\nMatej – We have partnerships with a few corporations that are going to build their own platforms or integrate it into their existing services, but I can’t disclose that information for now!\n\nNewsBTC – Can you comment about the company’s investors or what type of investors DECENT was able to find?\n\nMatej – We had: US/Chinese/Malaysian VC funds (seed investment); they invest into blockchain-based applications as they believe this will be the future of the world. The blockchain will replace many services that work well today—remember, Uber is a middleman. They take 20% fees.\n\n\n\nNewsBTC – How do you see or what is your vision about BTC and the blockchain’s significance to freedom of speech?\n\nMatej – The blockchain is decentralized trust. Most of the people need some sort of a third party to refer to, such as their grocery, transporter, the one they work for, etc. Since the early days, centralization has been a major competitive advantage: the media has been controlled and manipulated by monopolies and oligopolies that pushed the market advantage to make profits in detriment of authors and readers.\n\nThe advent of the internet did not help much to get rid of centralization in order to move to more competitive markets; the blockchain meant a revolution in this paradigm. For the first time, people are able to use a fully competitive market for digital content, where 100% of the revenue paid by readers goes to the authors in order to put money where it should be on behalf of everyone but greedy monopolists and oligopolists.\n\nNewsBTC – What are your prospects and expectations for the future of the DECENT platform?\n\nMatej – We are hoping that within five years we will become the main publishing protocol worldwide. Get more developers and integrating into more existing content distribution protocol and platforms. Save time, money and create new, better, fully competitive markets.\n\nNewsBTC – What are your expectations for the future of Bitcoin and digital currencies?\n\nMatej – I believe that more and more services are going to be replaced by blockchain-based ones, such as notary public, money transfers, e-governments, etc. I believe both Bitcoin and blockchain technology have a bright future ahead.\n\nYou can watch a description in the official DECENT video:']"
