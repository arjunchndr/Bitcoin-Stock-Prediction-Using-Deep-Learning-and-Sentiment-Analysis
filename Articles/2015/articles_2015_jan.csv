01/01/2015,"['The disappearance of 99% of the bitcoins missing from Mt Gox can be blamed on internal system manipulation and not any external attack, a major Japanese newspaper has claimed.\n\nCiting an unnamed source connected to the ongoing police investigation, Japan\'s Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper led with the story on the front page of its New Year\'s Day edition. Only 7,000 BTC, or 1% of the total 650,000 missing, could be attributed to hacking attacks from outside the company, it said.\n\nYomiuri did not elaborate further on the matter.\n\nThat a company insider might have been responsible for the theft of 650,000 BTC from Mt Gox has been whispered about for some time, though no-one in particular has been named as a suspect, even unofficially.\n\nNo major hack attacks\n\nMt Gox had no full-time staff other than CEO Mark Karpeles, employing a series of contractors on temporary work arrangements. No-one associated with the case, however, is suggesting Karpeles might himself be responsible.\n\nThe \'inside job\' theory is contrary to the official line the company has maintained until now, that the bitcoins\' disappearance was a gradual theft attributable to the \'transaction malleability\' flaw in bitcoin\'s underlying code.\n\nThis claim was derided at the time by bitcoin core developer Gavin Andresen and other independent researchers. Mt Gox began using the transaction malleability line in early February, even before it was clear the exchange had been damaged beyond repair, saying withdrawals would resume as soon as possible.\n\nBlame the bots?\n\nThe clearest sign of impropriety within the Mt Gox trading system came in March 2014, when leaked transaction data showed anomalous behaviour attributed to two automated trading bots, nicknamed \'Willy\' and \'Markus\'. The Yomiuri report links ""suspicious accounts"" to the disappearance, but does not specify whether it means these known accounts or new information.\n\nThe \'Willy\' bot appeared at certain times in late 2013 and seemingly under several different user IDs, all of which had irregularities in their records, such as ""??"" in place of a user location.\n\nThe bot would pop up under a new user ID, spend (for the most part) $2.5m buying bitcoins at the then-current market rate, and then cease trading. It is possible this helped push up bitcoin\'s price in November 2013.\n\n\'Markus\' was an earlier bot that \'bought\' bitcoins at random prices, though appeared to never spend any actual fiat money on the transactions. The two bots acquired about 570,000 BTC until November 2013, after which no more records are publicly available.\n\nAssuming the automated activity continued after that time and until Gox\'s implosion two months later, one theory is those two bots were connected with the disappearance of the 650,000 BTC.\n\nImage courtesy Akemi Miyashita\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

And as far as bitcoin goes, in nearly all respects, it’s a good thing to see that year in our rearview mirror. It was a challenging time, to say the least. Now we’re off to a fresh start. What’s next for the cryptocurrency industry? Inside Bitcoins asked a wide-ranging group of bitcoin insiders to speculate — from venture capitalists to game show hosts — all with their own unique stake in the fortunes, and failures, of blockchain technology. Here is what they said:\n\nAndrew Beal, associate at Crowley Corporate Attorneys\n\n“To the relief of many, the conversation in the industry has shifted from ‘the price of bitcoin’ to ‘applications for blockchain technology and digital assets.’ A critical mass of developer talent is trickling into the industry and when we hit the tipping point, assuming adequate funding is available, the pace of blockchain innovation will accelerate at an exponentially higher rate.\n\n“Contributing to this acceleration will be the continued recognition by mainstream financial and payment players, and their willingness to assist in the development, of digital currencies and blockchain technology for specific purposes.\n\n“States are often described as the ‘laboratories for democracy’ and I anticipate 2015 being the year of virtual currency-specific regulation on a state level. 2014 was spent largely getting up to speed. As companies look for clear rules, the imminent release of New York’s BitLicense Program and other virtual currency-specific guidance from key states should inspire other states to clarify their positions on certain business models and activities.\n\n“The continued use of crowd sales by companies and the proliferation of new digital assets is likely to prompt other federal agencies that have remained relatively silent up to this point to speak up (SEC, CFPB).”\n\nMike Rotman, founder of Streamin’ Garage and creator, executive producer and host of bitcoin game show “Take My Bitcoins”\n\n“Predicting what will happen to bitcoin is a lot like putting on my turban and doing my Johnny Carson “Carnac” impression. (If you’re under 45 yrs old, look it up on YouTube.)\n\n“When we came up with the game show Take My Bitcoins, the price of bitcoin was around $1,000 and no one in my circles, myself included, knew our hashrate from our blockchain. We figured once we introduced celebrities and the masses to bitcoin by giving away $40,000 of the stuff, the world would catch on and the price would soar as everyone would be using it. The price of bitcoin is now over $600 lower. You’re welcome world!\n\n“The problem I see with bitcoin now is the same I saw a year ago and why we came up with the show \xad– it’s still really hard to use and really hard to understand how to use it. Ledgers, mining, paper wallet, cold storage; what sounds normal to bitcoin enthusiasts sounds like gibberish to everyone else. And once people do ‘kind of’ understand it, they still don’t know why they need to convert dollars to bitcoin to buy something on Overstock they could have bought for dollars in the first place. Or they take an even darker view, such as my mom who calls me after every show: ‘Very funny, and you’re going to need that sense of humor when they put you in jail for dealing with this scam bitcoin money.’\n\n“So while semi-\xadmainstream places like Newegg and Overstock are now taking bitcoin and there is even a Bitcoin Bowl to get the word out, there is still a long way to go and a huge language barrier between the Bitcoin experts who still can’t or don’t want to explain bitcoin in the most simple terms: ‘It’s money, save it, spend it, it costs less in transactions, and that’s all you need to know.’ After all, I have no idea how my credit card works, I just know it does.\n\n“As long as it’s hard to get, hard to use, and not ‘dummied down for the mainstream,’ it’s not going to catch on.”\n\n“So what’s my prediction? Pain. Wait, wrong movie. But yet, still growing pains for the coin. (The blockchain to me is the real technology here which will change many industries.) But for the coin itself, as long as it’s hard to get, hard to use, and not ‘dummied down for the mainstream,’ it’s not going to catch on.\n\n“I predict the average price in 2015 will be $150 range \xadunless someone finally gets through to the masses with simple language, a simple to use app, and all around a great viral marketing blitz.\n\n“But until then, (Mike puts on his Carnac turban, puts envelope up to head and says:) ‘Hash Rate.’ (Mike blows into the envelope and opens it.) ‘How do you measure the average number of pot jokes in a Seth Rogan film? Hash Rate.”\n\nPerianne Boring, founder and president of Chamber of Digital Commerce\n\n“Bitcoin will prove to be resilient in 2015. The case for Bitcoin is becoming more and more obvious as we are seeing increased security hacks in even the most reputable and credible companies. I believe many Bitcoin skeptics, including some players on Wall Street, will begin to see Bitcoin as an opportunity, opposed to a threat. I also foresee several additional Members of Congress taking public stands of support for digital assets and even accepting digital currencies for campaign contributions.\n\n“We can’t deny that Bitcoin is under scrutiny by government, which will likely heighten in 2015.”\n\n“However, we can’t deny that Bitcoin is under scrutiny by government, which will likely heighten in 2015. We may see increased enforcement actions from the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations, Homeland Security, Europol and INTERPOL. The Digital Chamber will be working with the industry to provide expert legal and educational resources to help companies understand their responsibilities under the law.\n\n“There may also be additional rule makings out of the federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), among others, as well as from individual states. Some of these rules could open up new markets and avenues for investors, others could be very burdensome and onerous for businesses, which is why it is essential for the industry to be engaged in Washington.\n\n“At the Digital Chamber, we will be focused on educating and facilitating dialogue between Washington and the industry to promote a pro-growth legal framework.”\n\nNicolas Cary, CEO of Blockchain.info\n\n“Bitcoin will move beyond capturing the imagination of entrepreneurs to capturing the attention of board rooms. Companies will be asking themselves ‘what is our bitcoin strategy?’\n\n“In 2015 hundreds of millions of dollars of development will come online bringing improved software, enhanced experiences, and hardened security.\n\n“At Blockchain, we will continue to build innovative software that makes using Bitcoin safe, easy, and secure for all consumers and businesses anywhere in the world.”\n\nGavin Andresen, chief scientist, Bitcoin Foundation.\n\n“I predict it will be another year of drama and chaos; I expect there to be spectacular failures as Bitcoin startups do what startups mostly do — fail. I expect there to be more spectacular scams and more prosecutions of scammers as consumers and law enforcement both grapple with who to trust and who not to trust.\n\n“But despite all of the inevitable chaos and drama, I also expect a background of steady growth and maturing. Bitcoin technology will become more robust, and bad companies failing and scammers going to jail will clear the way for strong companies and trustworthy people to continue building out the infrastructure, making the technology more secure and easier to use.\n\n“I don’t speculate on exchange rates, I have no idea where the bitcoin/dollar exchange rate will go in 2015.”\n\nMarco Santori, counsel at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP\n\n“I expect to see continued growth of the Bitcoin protocol used as a currency, but I expect that growth to be outstripped in 2015 by Bitcoin 2.0 applications built on platforms like Counterparty.\n\n“My practice tends to track this growth. As more businesses enter into higher-value transactions, I do more transactional work and contract negotiation.\n\n“Likewise, as the stakes increase, we will likely see more litigation in the digital currency space. I defended a party in one of the first major Bitcoin mining litigations when Bitcoin mining was in the spotlight. In 2015, I expect to see the first Bitcoin 2.0 litigation.”\n\nMoe Levin, founder of The North American Bitcoin Conventions and director of European business development at BitPay\n\n“The fact that we are instantly connected to people from all over the world through our phones, shows me how rapidly our world has changed in recent years and what an important role technology now plays in our lives. It also shows me how ready the world is for a new form of payment that is as international and as mobile and as easy as the rest of the technology in our lives. It shows me that it’s time to move forward with bitcoin and give the world a currency befitting of our current age.\n\n“In my view, the first big steps to bringing bitcoin into the mainstream have been taken and we are at a juncture now where we must make wise choices to ensure its success. As we’ve read in many articles and as we have seen in the last year, regulation and tax law are not about to go away and are an unavoidable part of the world in which we want to bring bitcoin.\n\n“I believe, as do many others, that we need to work with regulators and respect tax law for the currency to be trusted by governments, and in turn, to be accepted by the public. If we go it alone, and remain outside the system, others will step into the niche we have created. Which would be a great tragedy, because no other payment system will ever be as open-source and as community-orientated as bitcoin – two very unique traits in today’s world.”\n\nAdam Draper, founder and CEO of Boost\n\n“Bitcoin will hit $1500. Volume of Bitcoin will quadruple. Banks will release guidelines to banking a Bitcoin company. Great use cases will be used.\n\n“Multiple companies will raise more than $100m in Venture capital. Boost VC will have the largest Bitcoin company portfolio.”\n\nAshok Misra, founder Alina Consultants\n\n“I continue to be fascinated by Bitcoin. I hold the belief that Bitcoin is a stupendous invention that has the potential to be truly transformative. The use case that excites me the most for crypto currencies is ecommerce. I think Bitcoin has the ability to dramatically transform ecommerce payments.\n\n“I am confident that bitcoin will gain further acceptance in 2015. I expect Bitcoin 2.0 initiatives to deliver unique products and solutions using blockchain technology.\n\n“About price predictions, I do not believe in speculation. Bitcoin is a superior currency system. However, I do not think a huge depreciation of government issued fiat currency in relation to BTC is critical for BTC success. I think stability and wider participation are more important for the long term.”\n\nJuan Llanos, EVP of strategic partnerships and chief transparency officer, Bitreserve\n\n“To use an architectural analogy, 2015 will be the year when the concrete will be poured onto the industry’s foundations. Thirteen was a year of awareness and awakening to a new realm of possibility enabled by this brilliant invention that Bitcoin is. We saw a glimpse of the scaffolding necessary to build the industry in 2014, but clarity of regulatory expectation and infrastructural standards will emerge during the course of 2015.\n\n“This means that companies, having become aware that building a digital exchange, bank or payment processor is not the same as building a smartphone app, will need to get properly capitalized to meet regulatory and infrastructural standards and upgrade their management.\n\n“I have no idea and no method to estimate how much bitcoin will be worth at the end of 2015 other than wetting my index and putting it up in the air. My hope and wish for 2015 is for the industry to mature fast, and the serious issues to be addressed. This is a precondition to elicit trust and legitimacy, which in turn will attract serious investment. If that happens, I’ll venture to say bitcoin can easily double its value in 2015.”\n\nJaron Lukasiewicz, CEO and founder of Coinsetter\n\n“2015 will see important breakthroughs in the Bitcoin industry. Availability of state licensing will open in the United States, bringing further acceptance by domestic banks. Next, Bitcoin companies throughout the space are transitioning from their development stage to become fully operational.\n\n“In 2015, companies in our industry will begin growing their businesses and will actually make money, which will in turn increase network usage, disrupt traditional payment methods, and fuel additional investment.\n\n“Finally, this coming year will see the ‘tokenization’ of the dollar and other fiat currencies through blockchain technology, routing more and more money transfers into the cryptographic realm.”\n\nPhoto, Times Square NYC, December 31, 2014 by Anthony Quintano', ""There is now another, more traditional method of buying PC games with Bitcoin. Green Man Gaming quietly began accepting the digital currency early last month.\n\nBesides accepting Bitcoin, Green Man Gaming is unique because it allows customers to sell the digital rights of their game back to Green Man Gaming if it is purchased on the affiliated Playfire distribution platform. That comes back in the form of credit. Games cannot currently be sold for Bitcoin.\n\nDeals aren't limited to the Playfire platform, as deals for games on Valve's Steam and EA's Origin are included, as well as DRM-free games. Bitcoin is now a payment option for “customers who currently pay in USD,” meaning that, for now, international customers may be out of luck, although they could try to mess around with their profile settings. There is nothing that says Bitcoin payments are limited to US customers, only those who have their purchases denominated in USD.\n\nThis news represents another removal of friction between Bitcoin users and the digital video game economy. Last month, Microsoft began accepting Bitcoin for digital purchases, including games on its Games for Windows and Xbox Live platforms.\n\nSteam users, however, have until recently been shut out of the Bitcoin experience. A few bundle sites accept Bitcoin, and there have always been Steam gift card resellers, and even a few sites dedicated to selling Steam keys for Bitcoin. But Green Man Gaming is an established, mainstream DRM reseller and uses that established presence to nab some impressive deals.\n\nThere is also the added bonus that every Green Man Gaming customer, many of whom are likely not current Bitcoin users, will see it as an option at checkout. That amounts to free advertising for Bitcoin.\n\nWe have reached out to Green Man Gaming for comment and have not yet heard back, but the original blog post is from early December. Clearly, this is a story that we missed, but it is worth noting because digital distribution is what Bitcoin was essentially designed to facilitate first and foremost. It isn't immediately clear what payment processor Green Man Gaming is using, or whether it has developed its own system for accepting Bitcoin payments. They also kept open the possibility of accepting other cryptocurrencies in the future.\n\nThe next step for PC gaming and Bitcoin may be getting Steam itself to accept Bitcoin directly. Founder Gabe Newell expressed some reservations about the idea during a Reddit AMA back in March, citing stability concerns. With both his competition and an increasing number of resellers accepting the digital currency, he may have reason to reconsider.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The world is changing, and these two technologies are playing a major role. Over the past year, numerous companies have begun adopting cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin as a means to expand their market reach. Even Microsoft and Overstock have begun accepting the online currency. With that said, the majority of merchants still will not touch Bitcoin, likely concerned with its erratic price fluctuations, and the uncertainty surrounding the currency when it comes to laws, taxes, and security.\n\nIn the past, however, we have seen that those companies who do jump on the bandwagon receive a boost in sales, as well as the backing of a large, tightly knit community of individuals who thoroughly support the cryptocurrency.\n\nUp until this point, those wishing to purchase a 3D printer with Bitcoin had few options. Overstock, who accepts Bitcoin, sells only 3D Systems’ Cube printers, and the few other sites out there seem rather sketchy. That’s until recently when ISG, based in Sherbrooke, Canada, announced a brand new 3D printer, the ISG II. Along with the release of this new machine, which is currently available on their site for pre-order, the company also announced that they will accept Bitcoin as a payment option.\n\n“We are already accepting Bitcoin and have been proud to collaborate with CannabisCoin on a line of 3D printed grinders,” stated Samuel Guillemette, CEO and Founder of ISG. “We are open to more collaboration with the cryptocurrency community. We want to bring the best experience to the users.”\n\nThe machine itself is based off of a Prusa i3 design. The company custom built their own frame, and added a heated build platform. Below you will find some of the general specifications for the ISG II:\n\nPrinter Size: 42cm x 42 cm x 46 cm\n\nBuild Envelope: 20cm x 20cm x 18cm\n\nFilament Diameter and Compatibility: PLA/ABS at 1.75mm\n\nPrint Resolutions: 0.1mm\n\nPriced at just $899.00 excluding taxes, or 2.8334 Bitcoin (at the current exchange rate), this 3D printer is certainly a very capable machine. ISG, a relatively new company, plans on rapidly expanding, offering a second 3D printer geared more towards professional users, called the ISG 730. This machine will be priced at $3,999.00 before taxes, and also be available for purchase via Bitcoin. Additional details on the 730 are forthcoming, as the company is busy planning to open a local storefront in Sherbrooke, Canada within the next few months.\n\nHave you been looking for a way to purchase a 3D printer with Bitcoin? Is the ISG II perhaps that printer? Let’s hear your thoughts in the ISG II / Bitcoin forum thread on 3DPB.com.', 'California has 930 new laws going into effect in 2015.

However, the PayCoin price has plunged since December 29, perhaps in part due to the recent PayBase security issues, as well as confusion about the full functionality PayBase’s Amazon integration.\n\nAlso read: Josh Garza Speaks On PayBase Launch With Amazon Shopping Using PayCoin\n\nPayCoin Price Plunges\n\nScores of altcoins launch each month, and most receive little attention. However, PayCoin is one of those rare altcoins with enough funding and infrastructure to muscle its way into cryptocurrency’s upper echelon. PayCoin–and its payment platform PayBase–are designed to work with the legacy credit card systems most businesses already employ. Moreover, PayBase integrates with merchant APIs to allow customers to buy products with PayCoins from within the PayBase platform. Consequently, many investors are bullish on PayCoin.\n\nHowever, others are not convinced, and skeptical observers had their fears confirmed when PayBase was hit by an apparent security malfunction shortly after its launch on December 30. GAW claims the issue was a minor CloudFare glitch, but some investors remain worried that customer data was compromised or could be in the future.\n\nAs a result, the PayCoin price reversed its upward trend and plunged over the past few days. From December 25-29, the PayCoin price soared climbed more than 1,000,000 satoshis to 4,063,012 (As with most altcoins, bitcoin is PayCoin’s largest trading pair).\n\nBut then the PayCoin price decline began. The PayCoin price dropped on December 29, ending the day at 3,938,736 satoshis. The downward pace steepened on December 30, as the PayCoin price plummeted to 3,150,018 satoshis. The negative trend continued on New Year’s Eve, and the PayCoin price rang in the New Year with a whimper. The current PayCoin price is 2,604,831 satoshis. PayCoin currently sits third among cryptocurrency market caps with a total valuation of $~98 million according to CoinGecko. The coin has a ~$3 million edge on fourth-place litecoin.\n\nWhat do you think the outlook for the PayCoin price is in 2015?

The US saw 9 per cent fewer digital albums and 12 per cent fewer digital songs sold over the year, according to Nielsen Music data. In contrast, US audio and video streaming increased more than 50 per cent, with 164bn songs streamed. The shift underscores stark changes in the digital music market, where growth in the downloads that form the bedrock of Apple’s iTunes music store has stalled while subscription and advertising-supported streaming services such as Spotify and Deezer have seen rapid growth. Last year, Apple bought Beats, whose streaming music service it plans to bundle into its iOS operating system early in 2015. 2014’s biggest selling artist in the US, with 3.66m of the year’s 257m album sales, was Taylor Swift, who took a stand against Spotify by withdrawing her music in favour of download-only sales. The Frozen soundtrack was the year’s second-biggest seller, followed by British singer Sam Smith, who also broke through in the UK in 2014. In the UK, download sales fell for the first time in 2014, ending a strong run of growth that began with the launch of iTunes just over a decade ago. The retail value of UK recorded music sales fell almost 2 per cent to £1.03bn, according to the BPI, which represents British record labels, and the Official Charts Company. For the first time since OCC began monitoring sales, all of the top 10 albums were by British artists. The BPI reported that 30m albums were downloaded in 2014, down from 32.6m a year ago, whereas the retail value of subscriptions to streaming services surged 65 per cent to £175m. The US and the UK are two of the biggest music markets alongside Japan, which makes them bellwethers for global trends. Kevin Brown, of Spotify, said 2014 was “the year in which streaming has truly become mainstream in the UK”.', ""Najmeh Bozorgmehr in Sanandaj JANUARY 1, 2015 37 For Hassan Amini, Friday prayers are a weekly reminder of the “humiliation” faced by Iranian Sunni. The dissident Sunni cleric, who lives in Iran’s Kurdistan province, notes that Sunni worshippers must listen to sermons by imams appointed by Shia rulers in faraway Tehran, a reminder that they cannot choose their own religious leaders or run their own religious schools. Although Iran’s constitution guarantees equal job opportunities and freedom of (recognised) religion for all Iranians, the country’s Sunni say they are deprived of their rights because they are unable to choose their own clerics, have no mosque for the hundreds of thousands of Sunni in the capital and are obliged to follow the Shia religious calendar, which differs from the Sunni calendar and makes it difficult to hold some religious ceremonies. Although Iran’s Sunni, estimated to number about 10m, follow a moderate school of Islam, religious discrimination is fuelling discontent, adding to fears that the minority could become prey to the extremism espoused by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis), which has swept through neighbouring Iraq. The group has attracted Sunni extremists from around the globe and Iran has been gripped by unsubstantiated rumours that Isis members have infiltrated over the Iraqi border and that the group has lured Iranian Sunni to kill Shia, whom they consider infidels. There are also suggestions that Isis followers have been arrested or even hanged after being detained in Iran. Mr Amini, a 68-year-old white-bearded cleric, who spent more than three years in jail in the 1980s for rebelling against Shia politicians, shrugs off the allegations. “Isis does not have a popular base in Iran,” he says. He insists that even in Kurdistan province, Isis has no following even though about 90 per cent of the population is Sunni and many feel discriminated against for both their religion and their Kurdish ethnicity in a country dominated by Shia Persians. Sitting cross-legged on a carpet surrounded by shelves of books, he denies rumours that Isis followers gather in a mosque in Sanandaj, the provincial capital. Special reports Year in the Arab World The past year will be remembered as one of the Middle East’s most tumultuous, a time of political decadence and shattered illusions. Rarely a peaceful region, the Arab world was convulsed in 2014 by existential crises Continue reading “These are not true,” he says. “There are 250 Sunni mosques in Sanandaj. Even if some radical Sunni gather in one mosque, it is nothing to worry about, although it could be an indication of some young Sunni’s frustration at the discrimination they face.” But he warns: “Isis is the result of injustice [against Sunni]. When there is injustice, there is uprising.” Ali Shamkhani, Iran’s top security official, confirmed to the Financial Times in a recent interview that 22 Iranian Sunni were arrested before crossing the border to join Isis and that Sunni extremists had raised the Isis flag in a village in western Iran. But he insisted “there are no relations” between Isis and Iranian Sunni and added that the extremist group was unable to recruit forces from Iran. Analysts say Isis is unlikely to make inroads with Iran’s Sunni because they follow a moderate interpretation of Islam, although there are communities in Sistan-Baluchestan that follow a more conservative branch of Sunnism akin to the conservative Salafist Islam of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE. The province is a base for Sunni rebels who have in recent years carried out ambushes and kidnappings and have killed civilians and security agents. Three members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards were killed in the province over the weekend in an attack the Fars news agency blamed on “armed bandits”. “Sunni extremists cannot really influence Iran’s society but they are a danger in a sense that even if they have only 50 loyalists and only two of them embark on suicide attacks in Sanandaj, it will make the city insecure,” Ejlal Ghavami, a human-rights activist says. The Islamic regime in Tehran has little tolerance of Sunni campaigns for more rights. An estimated 100 Sunni are in jail for protesting and about half face the death penalty. Even moderate politicians have been unable to change this policy. The centrist government of Hassan Rouhani, who enjoyed large support from Sunni areas in the 2013 election, was unable to appoint a Sunni governor in Kurdistan despite promising in his election campaign to do so. When Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, the oil minister, a Shia Kurd, appointed Emad Hosseini, a Sunni Kurd, as his deputy for engineering, eyebrows were raised in the holy city of Qom where the senior Shia clergy live. The appointment is seen as too little by many Sunni Kurds who believe the Islamic regime mistrusts them more for their religion than their ethnicity. “Even if the existing law, despite its flaws, is applied, we would be happy,” says Mr Amini. “We don’t have enmity with anybody but will not stay quiet in face of injustice.” Iran's air strikes against Isis Play video"", 'Sarah Gordon, Business Editor JANUARY 1, 2015 0 The grand surroundings of the Royal Academy of Engineering in London’s Carlton House Terrace do not seem entirely appropriate for the man in charge of UK government efforts to modernise its approach to innovation. Iain Gray, who stepped down from his role as chief executive of Innovate UK on Wednesday, has spent his time at the agency trying to free it from the past. In August he changed its name from the Technology Strategy Board, a decision that, he says, marked a “change of direction” at the agency. When Mr Gray took it over in 2007, after a career at BAE Systems and Airbus, the agency had just been transformed from an advisory board to the Department of Trade and Industry into an independent body given the task of facilitating and financing innovation in the UK. Innovate UK has co-invested £3bn with the private sector in about 5,000 businesses over the past seven years. But Mr Gray says funding is not the main challenge that businesses face. “People always talk about money but they quickly move on to it being more than just about money, it’s about how do you connect the innovation landscape up,” he says. “It’s about how we join things up in a national and regional sense.” Innovate UK helps connect businesses to the infrastructure they need, putting them in touch with different government bodies, such as the Intellectual Property Office, and running a knowledge transfer network that has 100,000 members. It has also just started managing the UK arm of the European Enterprise Network, which aims to link innovators with other businesses providing services that they require. Last year UK designer and entrepreneur Jim Rokos won an award, sponsored by the network, for a glass vase that tilts as the flowers in it absorb water. David Connell, senior fellow at Cambridge university’s Judge Business School, who recently published a report on innovation, says Mr Gray has done “a fantastic job” in turning Innovate UK “from a branch of the civil service into an independent, business oriented innovation agency employing people with a technology and business background, and a more entrepreneurial approach to getting things done”. The agency has secured more funding to do so. Its budget has grown from £175m a year when Mr Gray took over to £500m — £20m of which pays for administration and its 250 employees. The remainder is mainly directed to businesses via a competitive funding process. Next year, Innovate UK will run 88 competitions, handing out a total of £400m to the winners. There are some great examples where targeted investment has proven to make a substantial difference — I don’t believe those stories are being told as loudly as they should Iain Gray Mr Gray has also broadened the range of companies that win backing. “We’ve made no secret of the fact that when we started you could characterise [our work] as funding to the large aerospace and automotive sectors.” Now, nearly two-thirds of funding goes to small and medium sized enterprises. He says some of the most exciting commercial possibilities spring from small companies — whether university spinouts or “innovation in a garage”. But he recognises that the UK faces stark challenges in this area. The country, and Europe as a whole, is falling ever further behind competitors such as the US and Asia. According to the World Intellectual Property Organisation, Europe’s share of global patent filings fell to its lowest percentage ever in 2013. Mr Gray argues that the UK’s greatest challenge is breaking down the barriers between research and the commercial world. A report by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, published last January, said while the UK had world-class strengths in research, there was a “sustained, long-term pattern of under-investment in public and private research and development, and publicly funded innovation”. Out of the companies that have won funding from the agency, Mr Gray cannot identify the ratio of successes to failures. But he believes Innovate UK played a key role in the “technology-led” resurgence of the car industry and has had a real impact in the fields of regenerative medicine and cell therapy. “There are some great examples where targeted investment has proven to really make a very substantial difference and I don’t believe that those stories are necessarily being told as loudly as they should.”', 'Jerome Cohen JANUARY 1, 2015 27 The arrest last month of Zhou Yongkang, China’s security tsar , is an occasion to assess the controversial anti-corruption drive initiated by Xi Jinping shortly after he assumed office as Communist party general secretary two years ago. Previous leaders launched similar campaigns, in what they called the party’s “life and death struggle against corruption”. But Mr Xi’s effort is proving more serious and enduring. It has had a tangible impact on the daily habits of party members at all levels of government as well as in the party apparatus, the massive state-owned enterprises and the more freewheeling Chinese business world. It has even permeated the country’s academic bureaucracy. All eat and travel less at public expense, and are more cautious in distributing and accepting the bribes — large and small — that have long greased the wheels of China’s economic and social progress. Many small fry have been caught in the net, but so have higher-ranking officials. Chinese diplomats have intensified their efforts to repatriate miscreants who have fled abroad, and to reel in the illegally obtained assets they took with them. The government has participated in international anti-corruption efforts, and it has sought ad hoc assistance to track down corrupt fugitives, even from countries that are too mistrustful of Chinese justice to enter into full-fledged extradition treaties. The party claims that its highest leaders, including past and present politburo members, will not be exempt from its anti-corruption purge. Yet many are sceptical. The two main “tigers” bagged thus far in the current campaign — Mr Zhou and his former ally Bo Xilai — were plainly opponents of the Xi faction. There are other, more prominent Chinese leaders who would seem to be more obvious candidates for investigators. Will Mr Xi and the able Wang Qishan, his Politburo Standing Committee colleague in charge of party discipline inspection, choose their targets more daringly and remove suspicions that, at the top, their campaign is little more than a convenient vendetta? The costs may prove greater than the benefits. Every investigator knows that their political capital is limited and that as a prosecutor they must always be selective. The issue is: what are the criteria determining selection? Targeting “tigers” among the present leaders’ supporters — and not only among their enemies — might convince the nation that this campaign is governed by an objective assessment of the public interest. Failure to pursue the well-connected will nourish cynicism and sap the energies of those responsible for the promised cleansing. Yet going further at the top risks dangerous turmoil in a party leadership that has only now consolidated, after the difficult first two years of Mr Xi’s reign. He has received at least one veiled public warning about this risk. Doubtless, some within the cadre have been more forthright in private. Is it any wonder that many in Beijing’s elite are experiencing uncertainty, fear and frustration? No one knows in which direction the current campaign will go. Who can feel safe? What can be done? Should the malefactors return to business as usual, but ply their trade in power and influence more discreetly? Or should they sit tight and hope that attention falls elsewhere? Is it now too late to move the people and assets they hold most precious to a place of safety abroad? Will they seek the protection of new leaders? If so, they confront the most fraught question of all: which ones? These are the questions that occupy many in Beijing today. For all China’s new-found economic might, it is a far more anxious place than most foreigners realise.

01/02/2015,"[""[Editor's note: The original version of this article carried the headline “Bitcoin becomes legal tender for transactions in California.” The use of the phrase “legal tender” overstated the extent of the new legislation, and was inaccurate. Although alternative currencies are now legal for transaction in California, there is no legal obligation for their acceptance in transactions. CoinTelegraph is sorry for the error.]\n\nBitcoin can be accepted and used for transactions in the US state of California as of yesterday, following the ratification of a new finance bill. Previously, only US Dollars were officially recognized, but the new bill allows for the use of other national and digital currencies.\n\nAmong a raft of new legislation coming into force for 2015 in California is the bill AB129 passed by Governor Jerry Brown in mid-2014. Aimed at ending a prohibition against using any alternative to US dollars for commerce in the state, the bill recognizes and permits the use of alternate currencies for transactions, including digital currencies such as Bitcoin, at the legislative level.\n\nThis newly accepting stance makes California one of the more Bitcoin friendly states in a country where political opinion about the rise of digital currencies is heavily polarized. New York made headlines in July 2014 when its plans for far-reaching legislation around the control and monitoring of Bitcoin companies caused outrage in the digital currency and startup communities. Often termed the 'BitLicense,' the measures were aimed at making the decentralized, often-anonymous world of Bitcoin into a financial market more similar to the established financial market, through increased record keeping and registration hurdles around all transactions.\n\nFeelings on the ground in New York also seemed less than positive this week with news of a community board in Manhattan rejecting the license for a planned “Decentralized Block Party” which was to offer “beers for Bitcoin,” and intended to show “creative ways to use a coin.”\n\nA similar lack of enthusiasm also appeared in California's own mayoral elections last year, however, following the initial passing of this AB129 finance bill. Seeking to capitalize on the press coverage and interest in the digital currency world, Bryan Parker ran as a candidate for mayor of Oakland on a platform of integrating Bitcoin into the operation of the city, and to attract startups involved in digital currency technology to the area. His failure to become elected did not, therefore, continue the enthusiasm for Bitcoin to the ballot box.\n\nFletcher Starkey, owner of CDXX, a San Francisco based bar and grill that's been accepting Bitcoin since it opened in 2014, has greeted with enthusiasm the new bill taking effect. Talking to CoinTelegraph, Starkey was proud of the state's move in the direction of legitimizing the digital currency, suggesting that:\n\n“California is leading the charge toward a more secure and simple payment system, which benefits customers and merchants, instead of credit card companies.”\n\nOn being an early adopter of digital currency payments in the city, Starkey explained that CDXX has “plenty of tech savvy consumers and business owners, and many open-minded entrepreneurs. I wish everyone of my customers would trade in their Visa for Bitcoin.”\n\nLong having been one of the new technology centers of the US, it's perhaps unsurprising that California is making headlines about leading the charge of Bitcoin acceptance in the country. The Silicon Valley area boasts 32 venture-capital-backed Bitcoin companies, more than the rest of the country put together, and state residents topped the chart for Googling “Bitcoin” more than any other state in 2014. The fact that Bitcoin has now been given the status of “legal money” will make further progress in not only raising awareness of the digital currency, but also encourage further merchants and services to accept the newly official currency as an alternative form of payment.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Instead, they reside in the memory pool of miners. Until a block is mined that includes the transaction, it is said to have ‘zero confirmations.’ Once included in a block and written to the block chain the transaction has one confirmation.\n\nConfirmation time is a measurement of a transaction’s depth or age, in the block chain; the higher the number of confirmations, the older the transaction. When transactions are first broadcast to the network, they are zero confirmation transactions. Some exchanges and merchants do not accept these transactions. Instead, Bitcoin payments sit in limbo waiting for confirmations.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nBitcoin’s Six Confirmation Bias\n\nToday, but more so in the past, exchanges and merchants require a minimum number of confirmations before accepting a transaction. Typically this number is six. Why?\n\nWell, after being broadcast zero confirmation transactions could wait as little as a few seconds to as long as hours or days for confirmation. Even though there is no way to rescind a transaction once broadcast, there is a bias towards accepting zero confirmation transactions.\n\nThe first reason is fear of a double spend attack. It is possible to broadcast multiple transactions at different points of the Bitcoin network. The transaction propagated to the highest number of miners first, wins. It is possible for an attacker to double spend by broadcasting two zero confirmation transactions. If timed correctly, the merchant software accepts the bogus transaction before receiving the double spend transaction.\n\nAlso read: Undoing the Undoable: Bitundo – Doublespending Bitcoins as a Service\n\nThe merchant is technically accepting an invalid transaction. The flaw exists because of the time it takes transactions to propagate the network. The two transactions are racing another across the globe.\n\nFor example, if my client is directly connected to your full node my transactions will relay through your software first. Your client will store the transaction and relay it to its known nodes. If I create four other clients and connect them to well-connected full nodes, I could lie to your node.\n\nIf each of my clients runs the same wallet software, with the keys they can build two separate transactions that spend the same bitcoins. For me to lie to you, I time the broadcasting of the transactions. My client that connects to the network through you will send a transaction to one of your addresses. My other four clients will broadcast a different transaction that claims the same bitcoins to one of my addresses.\n\nFor a short period, you will not be in sync with the network. That’s the window of opportunity for a potential attack.\n\nHow much of a risk is a double spend? Well, services like Bitpay accept zero confirmation transactions because they monitor key nodes on the network. Once a transaction passes through these miners, there’s no significant chance the transaction is invalid. After about 30 seconds the possibility of a double spend disappears. The transaction has been relayed to the majority of the network. Any attempt to broadcast a new transaction for the same bitcoins will fail.\n\nThe window of time is very short. Any payments through Bitpay’s payment process demonstrate most transactions are safe to accept after just a few seconds. Also, for the majority of transactions, the cost of performing a double spend is far greater than the gains. It’s not as lucrative to double spend low-value transactions. Purchases under $1,000 are likely safe. However, waiting 30 seconds for the transaction to relay is not unreasonable.\n\nZero Confirmation Transactions Aren’t Alone\n\nThe second fear is that a bad actor that controls a significant portion of the hash rate could mine on a forked chain and orphan past blocks. In this scenario, the attacker mines a block. Instead of broadcasting the block, the miner begins a forked block chain and broadcasts a transaction that spends bitcoins.\n\nAlso read: Stealth Payments Create Anonymous Bitcoin Transactions\n\nThe network could confirm the transaction, mining it in a block. The attacker will continue mining on their forked block chain. If it becomes longer than the main Bitcoin block chain, they release their blocks. In Bitcoin, the longest chain always wins. The block that confirmed the double spend transaction becomes an orphan and made invalid. The attacker’s blocks include a transaction to themselves that spend the coins they spent earlier.\n\nThe possibility of a brute force attack like this is also very low. The cost of this kind of Bitcoin attack is much higher than a double spend. While zero confirmation transactions would always be at risk for this kind of attack, the probability of success diminishes as the confirmation time grows. An attacker controlling 10% of the network would have a .1% chance of reversing a six confirmation transaction.\n\nWhat Do You Think? Comment Below?\n\nImages from Bitnodes and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Anarchist activist Cody Wilson has officially launched his candidacy for the upcoming Bitcoin Foundation board elections, and reaffirmed his intention to try and disband the organization from within if successful.\n\nWilson nominated himself with a post on the foundation\'s forums on 20th December and has also launched a website to support his campaign.\n\nA staunch opponent of bitcoin regulation or centralization, Wilson is also best known for co-founding Defense Distributed, a donor-funded nonprofit organization that designs and distributes plans for the 3D-printed \'Liberator\' pistol and \'Ghost Gunner\' CNC milling machine.\n\nHe was also part of the founding team of DarkWallet, the project to make bitcoin transaction anonymization easy for everyday users.\n\n""I will run on a platform of the complete dissolution of the Bitcoin Foundation and will begin and end every single one of my public statements with that message,"" Wilson said in November when he first announced his intention to run.\n\nNotably, the Bitcoin Foundation\'s November announcement that it would wind down its education, outreach and public policy efforts to focus on developing bitcoin\'s software core appears not to have weakened his campaign.\n\nWilson\'s recently posted manifesto also does not hold back on its combative rhetoric and disdain for the foundation, with its introduction that states:\n\n""This Bitcoin Foundation ... was always an embarrassing exercise in bad faith and state philosophy. It was always a vessel for frauds and second-rate minds to collude against the public. I invite you now to its ritual sacrifice.""\n\nElections will be held 13-19th February for the individual board seats being vacated by outgoing executive director Jon Matonis and current chief scientist Gavin Andresen. Election committee chair Brian Goss posted an acknowledgement that nominations including Wilson\'s had been received. Official confirmations will be posted mid-January.\n\nThe foundation board also voted in November to retire the Founding Member seat of chairman Peter Vessenes, to be replaced with an International Chapter Director Seat to represent non-US affiliates. The goal is to eventually have a board 100% elected by foundation members.\n\nStructure is the problem\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Wilson said his complaint is not with any individual or group within the foundation, but the structure of the organization itself.\n\nThe problem with the Bitcoin Foundation goes all the way back to its inception and original mission, Wilson said, adding:\n\n""The best way to help your business is to be part of a trade group and lobby Congress for preferential or beneficial regulation.""\n\nRather than forming a body to standardize and protect an open-source technology a la the Linux Foundation, he said, the Bitcoin Foundation gave itself a wider role with lobbying power and creation of global policy strategies.\n\nIncoming executive director Patrick Murck promised a new era of openness and consultation with the foundation\'s constituents, and conducted surveys into what members wanted most. This led to the promise to focus only on bitcoin\'s technology.\n\nThis refocus on development only, however, is superficial and there is no meaningful break with its current incarnation, Wilson believes. He notes that public statements have not changed the foundation\'s by-laws, its established channels of communication or its affiliate programs around the world.\n\nEven if current leaders are sincere, those in the near or longer-term future could simply come in and pick up the threads previous lobbying efforts have left in place, he said.\n\nEarly actions\n\nWhen bitcoin\'s price shot up around April 2013 and began to appear in mainstream headlines, often in association with operations like Silk Road, regulators also started to take a much closer interest.\n\nIn response, advocacy groups, including the Bitcoin Foundation, hurried to reassure the authorities that the technology and most businesses were legitimate.\n\nHad it not done so, some say, government moves to further marginalize or even block access to bitcoin may have ensued.\n\nWilson disagrees, and says the foundation\'s founders were also too fast to reveal bitcoin\'s potential and seek to negotiate it with regulators.\n\nHe said:\n\n""It was the first self-annointed evangelists of bitcoin who were also the people that started this foundation. I just think it was such a critical kind of betrayal, because they gave the security state all the briefings on the technology, where we could\'ve [had] one, maybe two, more years of freedom to experiment.""\n\n\'Serious\' campaign\n\nDespite the rhetoric, the candidacy is not meant to be flippant or overly negative, Wilson said, and he intends to ""give other candidates a run for their money"".\n\n""Like in most of my endeavors, I don\'t know enough to know if it\'s impossible.""\n\nHe has been conversing with other former members of the foundation who have become disillusioned with the its recent direction, he said. This could potentially bring a contingent of energized participants to the election who wouldn\'t have been involved otherwise.\n\nWilson expects outside criticism of his campaign, or even challenges to his legitimacy via the foundation\'s own bylaws, should he be elected.\n\nHowever, it is a serious campaign, he stresses, saying it is legally possible while abiding by all the current rules. He would take his seat and does not wish other members to simply turn him away at the first board meeting.\n\nBitcoin without a foundation\n\nBut can bitcoin still succeed without a public face to argue for its legitimacy?\n\nThat depends on your definition of success, Wilson said, adding that in terms of acceptance and use, bitcoin\'s superiority over existing financial technology would see it make gains without formal help.\n\nHe said:\n\n""Most of the critical innovations in finance so far have just happened ... e-mail didn\'t need a foundation, it just took over the Internet like a wildfire, it was so superior to mailing a letter.""\n\nWilson would like to start a debate about what \'bitcoin\'s success\' actually means to different people, he said. He does not view success as bitcoin merely becoming an ""under the hood lubricant for other financial transactions"", unseen by users.\n\nInstead, it represents a kind of singularity that entails whole new political ways of being, new economic modes, rebellion.\n\nMaking ""Faustian bargains"" with regulatory powers would ultimately limit what can be achieved with bitcoin politically, even if the software remained capable of fulfilling Satoshi Nakamoto\'s original vision.\n\nJim Harper\'s alternate view\n\nJim Harper was the Bitcoin Foundation\'s Global Policy Counsel from March to December 2014, and is a senior fellow at libertarian think-tank the Cato Institute. Disagreeing with the foundation\'s decision to withdraw from public policy and education, he left his job there and is now also running for a board position.\n\nHe posted on the Bitcoin Foundation forums that he did not agree with Wilson\'s approach, and suggested it was more about provocation and drawing attention to the cause than for the good of bitcoin – but also that such discussion ""shouldn\'t be off the table"".\n\nHarper told CoinDesk that the foundation instead needs stability before it can again be a credible public policy voice or educational resource. While he has his own vision for the foundation\'s return to a policy role, it would require a consensus of the board.\n\n""Let\'s make sure there\'s a solid organization that has fundraising in place to support all its work, then we might regrow the organization into roles that many of us joined expecting the Foundation to do.""\n\nBitcoin can certainly exist without a foundation, Harper added, but a well-run foundation can help speed its adoption wordwide.\n\n""Education and public policy work can increase direct adoption and position conventional financial services companies to help deliver bitcoin\'s benefits to billions of people.""\n\nGrowing the bitcoin ecosystem this way would do nothing to prevent bitcoin from developing independently at the same time, he said. There need not be a conflict between those parts of the bitcoin community interacting with regulators, and others developing the ecosystem independent of government regulatory systems.\n\nInnovation is more uncomfortable\n\nWilson compared bitcoin pioneers to those of the 1990s\' \'cryptography wars\' who went to court and risked jail terms for creating technology like remailers and data encryption software PGP, as well as his own work with Defense Distributed.\n\nHe said:\n\n""Yes, it\'s more uncomfortable. You don\'t make as much money. If you want to start a bitcoin business you might run afoul of the SEC. But making these direct overtures to [regulators], without even being solicited, that seems to me to be a betrayal of the goodwill and political capital of early bitcoin.""\n\nWilson acknowledges that there is considerable anger and outrage in the words he\'s written in his campaign manifesto, but insists it is not his intent to be punitive.\n\nI don\'t believe it\'s purely about punishing the foundation for what it\'s done; it\'s about recognizing it and hopefully inviting whatever libertarian or anarchist segment of bitcoin is left and activating it.""\n\nCoinDesk spoke to the Bitcoin Foundation, but its leadership declined to comment other than saying anyone had a right to campaign on the platform of their choice and that the organization did not want to interfere in the electoral process.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Gox was due to insider tampering, a new report claims.\n\nAccording to Japanese publication The Yomiuri Shimbun, the fall of once-dominant bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was due to fraud, rather than an external hack. Sources at the Japanese Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) told the newspaper that out of 650,000 missing bitcoins, only 7,000 -- or one percent -- of the poached currency was lost due to cyberattack.\n\nApproximately 200,000 bitcoins were recovered from an ""old"" wallet following the Mt. Gox closure, but hundreds of thousands are still unaccounted for.\n\nSo what happened to the other 99 percent? Sources say Mt. Gox\'s system was ""fraudulently operated by an unknown party.""\n\nAs a result, the MPD\'s investigation of the failed bitcoin exchange now includes scrutinizing the behavior of one specific person who is ""familiar with the exchange system"" and may have stolen bitcoin from users by manipulating the system through fraud.\n\nTokyo-based Mt. Gox closed its doors without warning in February last year. The bitcoin exchange, once one of the most popular platforms online, filed for bankruptcy later in the same month. At the time, bitcoin belonging both to the exchange and users, worth approximately $500 million, vanished.\n\nCreditors were given until November 2014 to file claims for compensation.\n\nRumors and whispers of fraud and an inside job have circulated since the exchange floundered. However, no fingers have been pointed specifically at members of staff or the firm\'s board. Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles was required to attend interviews with police in Japan at the time Mt. Gox closed its doors, but no one associated with the investigation has suggested the executive is at fault.\n\nFraudulent trading goes against a statement issued by Mt. Gox at the time of the exchange\'s closure, which said a system bug which created a security flaw was at fault. The statement (.PDF) read:\n\n""We believe that there is a high probability that these bitcoins were stolen as a result of an abuse of this bug and we have asked an expert to look at the possibility of a criminal complaint and undertake proper procedures.""\n\nAccording to the Yomiuri, ""suspicious"" accounts may provide the answer to the rest of the missing 650,000 bitcoins. Traders became alarmed after discovering two automatic trading bots, nicknamed \'Willy\' and \'Markus,\' which appeared in 2013 at various times. According to leaked transaction data, the bots traded high amounts of the digital currency, before vanishing. Bitcoins handled by these bots did not correlate with user accounts.\n\nThe Mt. Gox investigation is ongoing. Karpalese told PC World that ""There\'s not much I can say at this point, except the fact that I will continue investigating in order to find what really happened.""\n\nRead on: In the world of security', ""A new paper explores how Bitcoin could transform the way we manage personal life insurance. Namely, the blockchain could provide a global, secure and public record of personal health information.\n\nIn a 51-page report, the research group Long Finance described a range of potential areas where the blockchain could come in handy in the insurance sector. The London-based initiative “holds hope” that these applications could aid consumers.\n\nFrom August to November, the Z/Yen Group asked financial service professionals, cryptography experts, and regulators about the blockchain's “potential relevance” to insurance. Their insights fill the report. The paper was co-authored by Professor Michael Mainelli and Chiara von Gunten, project manager of Long Finance. If you're short on time, a summary of the report is available as well.\n\nBitcoin is known for its unique storage properties. The blockchain is the public ledger that underpins the Bitcoin system. Once the data is entered, no one can tamper with the record. The idea is that in the insurance sector this extra ledger could store health-related information—potentially dealing a blow to fraud.\n\nBut hold up. The authors are quick to note that Bitcoin is not the only technology that could play a role in altering the insurance landscape. The blockchain, if it takes off in this realm, might coincide with other game changers, like mobile technology and the Internet of Things. These tools could help insurance companies gather more accurate data to tailor services.\n\nInsurance and the Blockchain: Four Themes\n\nWhile these other technologies are important to keep in mind, the blockchain has its own disruptive potential. The paper asks “what if” the Bitcoin blockchain could be used for different insurance activities? There are many ways this ledger can be used, the paper notes, and it splits up the uses into four groups: identity, space, time and mutuality.\n\nIdentity - Third parties currently store health care records. But individuals could keep this data on the blockchain instead, making it more accessible, and empowering the individuals. If record-keeping on the blockchain spreads, the report notes, the blockchain could disrupt how we manage identity. According to the report, these sorts of initiatives spring from the belief that people should be in control of their own digital identities and personal information. The paper reads:\n\n“In insurance, the streamlining of digital authentication and better management of personal data and history disclosure could translate into more direct and efficient relationships between insurance companies and individuals. Over time, this could bring additional benefits by reducing identity and claim frauds.”\n\nIt could also be used for health-related notary functions.\n\nSpace - Data could be stored in a different space. Insurance companies close off health records in order to keep them secure, and act as an intermediary to accessing personal health information. But respondents note that the blockchain is a public, global database, that allows people to query the database directly. For example, users can look at their data on the blockchain from anywhere—or share it with third parties—potentially bypassing red tape. According to the paper:\n\n“This dual relationship with space could support the tailoring of insurance products by expanding the range of products across places and by enabling nearly instantaneous adjustments of insurance coverage and pricing across space (and time).”\n\nTime - Bitcoin could change popular understanding of contracts in terms of time—in the short run and in the long run. The blockchain stamps the time that you place information in the blockchain or lock it in a contract. This could be used in many ways, such as to help tailor insurance products across time. Here's one scenario proposed:\n\n“When someone dies and the coroner verifies death and cause of death to their blockchain, then their last will and testament is released publicly, their health records are donated to medical research charities and their life insurance policy pays out automatically.”\n\nMutuality - The blockchain could facilitate alternate insurance options and perception of risk could change with the rise of alternative insurance structures. The paper imagines a shift away from risk pooling and proposes the rise of “mini-insurers” or “mini-mutuals.” Imagine the collaborative economy pioneered by startups like Airbnb and Uber, but extended to insurance when combined with mobile technology. On the other hand, the paper notes:\n\n“Blockchain technology may not revolutionise the way insurance operates. Nonetheless, it is likely to support wider trends of financial inclusion and new models of interactions between individuals and service providers including insurers.”\n\nThe Blockchain and Medical Data\n\nThe idea of storing medical data has been proposed several times before. Actuary Rui Dong briefly touched upon the blockchain's potential for insurance in a blog post. Israeli-based DNA.bits goes as far as to propose storing genetic data using blockchain technology—and keeping it private all the while. Some doctors have even pondered whether researchers could tap the blockchain, using the potentially vast repository of data for medical research. On the other hand, Long Finance's report is a deeper dive into the ins and outs of personal insurance.\n\nAll the while, a few early adopters are beginning to store data with the blockchain. BlockSign offers services to help users sign and store private records on the blockchain. Proof of Existence offers similar services, and the developer Manuel Araoz recently tweeted that he was contacted by a traditional notary. A couple recently used the blockchain to record their marriage—at Disney World no less. Nobody knows where this will lead. Long Finance noted that many of the insurers they talked to expressed doubts that the technology will lead anywhere in the short term. But the research group sees potential:\n\n“Every personal insurer’s core computer system is, at heart, a big, centralised transaction ledger. At the very least, blockchains deserve to be evaluated technologically by insurers, as a potential replacement for today’s central database model.”\n\nThe paper notes that the group's interest in cryptocurrencies began as early as 2005. Long Finance research aims to look at the long term for financial trends and the authors admit that cryptocurrency development moves at a breakneck speed. “This report would be written very differently only months from now,” the summary report concludes.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Its founder, Ola Doudin, a former Ernest & Young associate, believes the technology has the potential to address the many challenges encountered in the region and foster social development, reported PSFK.\n\nAccording to Doudin, Bitcoin can offer many solutions across the Middle East and significantly boost the e-commerce industry. She explained:\n\n""We know that the Middle East’s e-commerce market is one of the fastest growing markets in the world, yet around 85% of transactions is still done with cash.""\n\nLast year, international telecommunications company Ooredoo conducted an online study entitled ""New Horizons: Young, Arab and Connected,"" which provided a snapshot into the digital attitudes and aspirations of young people across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.\n\nAmong the key findings, it was expressed that 90% of the 10,500+ young adults interviewed believe that access to the Internet and mobile digital technology can help them realize their professional aspirations, and 91% also believe that technology is the basis of a modern, forward-thinking and functioning society.\n\nA further 72.8% of young adults in MENA believe freelancing online can provide them with better income opportunities than full-time work, ""yet many of these youth still can\'t be paid online,"" noted Doudin.\n\n""Women in villages can sell their handicrafts online and accept payments from anywhere across the world, farmers can receive Bitcoin loans and young people can freelance remotely and receive payments instantly.""\n\nWith 80% of MENA\'s adults being unbanked, Bitcoin could give the local population the prospect of leading a better life, ""have income, save or invest or have any access to financial tools to receive and send money,"" she added.\n\nAlong with being an effective and secure way of transferring value, Bitcoin is also a way to participate in a social experiment and a broader conversation. Amber Haque, the co-founder of The Pizza Guys, the first outlet in the United Arab Emirates to accept payments in the digital currency, stated:\n\n""This conversation [around Bitcoin] has been taking place for some time now and it is very interesting to us. It is changing the way people are thinking about currency. It is such a people-focused kind of currency.""\n\nWhile Bitcoin is believed to hold many opportunities, the fate of the digital currency in the MENA region is yet to be determined, noted Doudin.\n\n""Whether or not Bitcoin can be adopted as a universal or national currency is a different debate all together, and we have yet to see how different institutions and regulators will react to it across the world,"" she said.\n\n""I believe Bitcoin can co-exist with national currencies, however the form it will take will depend on how governments and regulators will react to this new technology and how they work with startups that are innovating in this space, ideally by creating new products that will become the next generation of fintech products that allow for further innovation rather than cracking down on it.""\n\nBitOasis is not the first startup to have decided to tap into the MENA region market. In late August 2014, Australia-headquartered Bitcoin exchange Igot launched the first exchange in the UAE, exploring the opportunities in the remittance market. Following rapid growth, the Australian startup announced in late November 2014 its plan to launch in Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Many ransomware viruses originate in Russia and other former Soviet bloc countries. The main difficulty in stopping cybercriminals isn’t finding them, but getting foreign governments to cooperate and extradite them.\n\nBy the time my mom called to ask for my help, it was already Day 6 and the clock was ticking. (Literally — the virus comes with a countdown clock, ratcheting up the pressure to pay.) My father had already spent all week trying to convince her that losing six months of files wasn’t the end of the world (she had last backed up her computer in May). It was pointless to argue with her. She had thought through all of her options; she wanted to pay.\n\nOnly, paying turned out not to be so easy; the CryptoWall hackers take only Bitcoins.\n\nPicture the kind of early-adopting, hoodie-wearing member of the technocracy totally comfy with the idea of a cybercurrency neither backed nor issued by any central bank or government. Now picture the opposite of that. That is my mom. Having never so much as purchased an app in her life, my mom had no idea how to buy Bitcoins. Happily, her ransomers had anticipated this problem and included a link to a step-by-step guide, complete with pictures.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe’d managed to make a cash deposit via Bank of America to the unique Bitcoin “wallet” provided by her ransomers, but since Bitcoin’s price is extremely volatile, her payment had already fallen $25 short by the time it arrived. ( Credit and debit payments can take up to six days to process.) The fastest way to send the extra $25 was to make a direct deposit at an A.T.M. that handled Bitcoin transactions. That’s where I came in. Coin Cafe, the Bitcoin provider my mother had chosen, had an A.T.M. in Greenpoint, Brooklyn , not too far from where I lived.\n\nThe Bitcoin A.T.M. was not easy to find. It was housed in the second floor hallway of a cooperative work space, tucked inside an old Nynex phone booth. On one hand, I appreciated the winking irony of this sight gag. On the other hand, Fidelity Investments this was not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInside was a little white box with no buttons, just a screen, a camera eye and a money slot. I scanned in the QR code my mom had sent me. The machine whirred to life. “Balance query in progress,” it announced. This query remained in progress for the next 20 minutes during which I left three messages on Coin Cafe’s voice mail before abandoning the booth to get some coffee and walk around in the rain.\n\nThe fourth time I called, a human being answered the phone and told me the problem had been fixed. I hurried back to the A.T.M., scanned in my QR code, sent some Voldemorts $25 in crisp bills and called my mom. The whole experience had not done much to allay my misgivings about Bitcoin; what did allay them was Mike Hoats, the nice bearded man Coin Cafe sent over to fix the A.T.M.\n\nWe got to talking after I made my payment, and he told me that, while no one at Coin Cafe believed people should fund criminal activity by paying the ransom, their job was to broker the purchase and sale of Bitcoins, which, like cash, could be used for any purpose. CryptoWall had thrust them into the unwitting role of ransomware advisers, coping with grandmothers crying on the phone at the thought of losing all their photos or small-business owners whose family income was on the line. Coin Cafe didn’t like profiting from the victims (according to the company, these transactions are in the low single digits as a percentage of its total business), but they were downright mortified to learn that CryptoWall had anointed them as one of their Bitcoin providers of choice, with praise for their “fast, simple service.” That’s how my mom found out about Coin Cafe — from her ransom note.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Others include the ability to “decrypt one file for free” and a message interface one can use “in case of any problems with payment or having any other questions.” What next, I wondered. Twenty percent off when you refer this malware to a friend? Frequent virus cards? Black Friday ransom specials?\n\n“I THINK they like the idea they don’t have to pretend they’re not criminals,” Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at the computer security firm Sophos, told me when I reached him in Vancouver by phone. “By using the fact that they’re criminals to scare you, it’s just a lot easier on them.” They don’t have to hire a professional translator to get their English perfect, Mr. Wisniewski explained, or engage in any of the baroque subterfuge required of someone pretending to be a Nigerian gentleman farmer who just needs a little help claiming his inheritance.\n\nIn addition to being criminals, these peddlers of ransomware are clearly businesspeople, skillfully appropriating all the tools of e-commerce. From branding (CryptoWall is a variant of a fearsome earlier virus called CryptoLocker, which was shut down last year) to determining what they can extort (ransomware hackers have tested the market with prices as low as $100 and as high as $800,000, which the city of Detroit refused to pay in order to have its database decrypted), these operators are, as Mr. Wisniewski put it, part of “a very mature, well-oiled capitalist machine.” It’s also an incredibly lucrative machine: Some experts estimate that CryptoLocker hackers cleared around $30 million in 100 days in 2013. And more than a million PCs worldwide have been hit with the CryptoWall virus.\n\nEven after reading through numerous descriptions of CryptoWall 2.0 as “the largest and most destructive ransomware threat on the Internet” and “an enormous danger for computer users,” I still couldn’t help thinking this was mainly a problem for moms who persist in using big, boxy PC computers and small-town police departments. Mr. Wisniewski quickly disabused me of that notion. Although CryptoWall has primarily affected Windows computers and Android cellphones so far, there is no technological barrier that prevents the virus from infiltrating Macs like mine. And when it does, Mr. Wisniewski chuckled, I should expect the ransom to be a lot higher.\n\nSo what can we all do to protect ourselves? Keep our computers backed up on an independent drive or by using a cloud backup service like Carbonite, take those software update and “patch” alerts seriously and, most of all, Beware the Attachment. (Remember: Brand-name businesses like J. Crew or Bank of America will rarely send you an attachment.)\n\nOf course, this advice arrives too late for my mom. And it appeared her payment had arrived too late as well: By the time I got home from Greenpoint, her CryptoWall ransom had been raised to $1,000, and the $500 in Bitcoins she had deposited had vanished. In a panic, she wrote to Mike Hoats asking for advice. What he told her sounded crazy to me. Use the CryptoWall message interface to tell the criminals exactly what happened. Be honest, in other words.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo she did. She explained that the virus had struck the same week that a major snowstorm hit Massachusetts and the Thanksgiving holiday shut down the banks. She told them about the unexpected Bitcoin shortfall and about dispatching her daughter to the Coin Cafe A.T.M. at the 11th hour. She swore she had really, really tried not to miss their deadline. And then a weird thing happened: Her decryption key arrived.\n\nWhen I shared the news with Mr. Hoats, he was jubilant. “That is great news, truly!” he wrote. “Whoever these yahoos are, they have some little shred of humanity.”\n\nBut Mr. Wisniewski had a more pragmatic take. “From what we can tell, they almost always honor what they say because they want word to get around that they’re trustworthy criminals who’ll give you your files back.”\n\nWelcome to the new ransomware economy, where hackers have a reputation to consider."", 'Jack Liu is head of Institutional Development at OKCoin. On his blog, Jack Liu proposes open Bitcoin security standards and how Bitcoin companies should compete.\n\nFundamentally, I don’t believe Bitcoin companies should be in the business of convincing customers who is more secure. – Jack Liu, OKCoin\n\nInspiration came to Liu after watching Olaf Carlson-Wee, Head of Risk for Coinbase, discuss custodial storage of customer funds. The marketing slogans advertising wallet services have become rhetoric. Security should focus on attracting customers. It should focus on security. Compete in speed, UI/UX design, features – whatever you desire. Security should be transparent. The entire Bitcoin ecosystem benefits from enacting collaborative, cross-checked best practices.\n\nAlso read: NSA Uses Christmas Holiday to Minimize Coverage of Documents Vindicating Snowden\n\nJack Liu’s Subtle “Unite or Die,” Maybe?\n\n“Every player in our industry has a vested interest in making sure best security practices are followed by other participants. If one wallet provider learns of an innovative new phishing attack that it has thwarted, the method of prevention should be shared with other wallets and exchanges in a timely way… Let’s not compete on security for it hurts all of us collectively and individually. “\n\nFive years ago would you know what “All customer funds kept in deep cold storage,” meant? Bitcoin does not have a failsafe like the Federal Reserve. No person can flip a switch and inflate the supply of bitcoins, but no “normal” person knows what that means. Most of all, constantly pushing innovation in the customer’s face is gimmicky and cheapens the message.\n\nSecurity does not work as marketing. Besides, security should be an expectation. No one should be bragging that they “haven’t messed up yet.” All of that effort and resources have a higher return spent working with one another to improve Bitcoin.\n\nPrior to his tenure with OKCoin, Liu worked for Kraken Bitcoin exchange where he was Director of Strategy. Liu is fluent in English and Chinese and spent years working in finance. Upon accepting a position with OKCoin, Jack expressed his desire to assist bridging the communication barrier between English/Chinese Bitcoin communities.\n\nJack points out the competition does not advertise security. Federal Depositors Insurance guarantees any customer with less than $250,000 need not worry about loss. Further still, in the event funds are not available, the Federal Reserve can step in and bail out the bank. Individuals making deposits in the US don’t even think about security.\n\nBitcoin cannot compete with the Federal Reserve System as a lender of last resort. Its ability to print currency on a whim and the general disinterest held by consumers for its effect makes it unbeatable. Instead of dozens of individual efforts fighting the battle alone – unite.\n\nImages from Jackcliu.com and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Taking the block chain out of Bitcoin and applying it to concepts beyond currency will be a key part of 2015.

Comment Below.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'In an article appearing on the Startup Management website, author William Mougayar argues that the blockchain technology might radically change the way software engineers develop applications in the future. According to Mr. Mougayar, the technology behind the blockchain represents a completely different paradigm in software design. Five concepts come into play that would enable the new computing paradigm. They are the blockchain, decentralized consensus, trusted computing, smart contracts and proof-of-work/stake. These concepts will play a decisive role in developing the kind of computing structures and solutions possible in the emerging blockchain world.\n\nIt is important to pay attention because these concepts will not be restricted to computing alone. They will increasingly be used to by business, law, society and will even have potential solutions in governance itself.\n\nAlso read: Microsoft also Exploring Blockchain Technology for the IoT “World of Distributed, Connected Devices\n\nDecentralized Consensus\n\nThe first element that Mr. Mougayar describes is the concept of decentralized consensus. Hitherto, transaction validity has been maintained through the maintenance of a single central database. In a decentralized environment, a virtual network is created through the use of nodes, and the authority to determine validity moves to this virtual network. The decentralized virtual network can record transactions on what is called a block. Each block has a hash of the previous block, and these together form the blockchain, which together with cryptography ensures that there is never a duplicate recording of the same transaction.\n\nUnder decentralized consensus, the need for a central intermediary is eliminated. It also decouples the consensus logic from the application itself giving developers the ability to write applications that can be organically decentralized.\n\nPossibilities Offered By the Blockchain\n\nThe second concept is the blockchain itself. Any data can be stored on the blockchain semi-publicly. The blockchain enables you do that since anyone can verify that you’ve placed the information, but only you would be able to see its contents. That ability is because only you hold the private keys to the data. It is in this respect that the blockchain most resembles a database albeit for a single difference. In a database, the header is private whereas on the blockchain the hash is public.\n\nThe data that is stored on the blockchain could be a crypto-currency balance. The blockchain, therefore, acts as an alternate method of transferring value that is virtually tamper-proof due to its encryption. In the example of the Bitcoin crypto-currency, this is accomplished through the use of addresses that are 34 characters in length. The bitcoin address is public but in order to use it there will be a need for another key which is private, and which is accessible only to the owner of the bitcoin address or wallet.\n\nTo use a real-world example, we can think of a home address. We routinely include our home addresses on numerous forms and other places. However, the fact that we have made our home addresses public does not give out any information about how our homes look like on the inside.\n\nOther Concepts that Will Expand Blockchain Use\n\nBut perhaps one concept that is likely to excite business in the next few years is the idea of smart contracts. In the context of decentralized applications such as are possible through the blockchain, smart contracts will enable two or more parties agree between themselves and bake the terms and conditions of their agreement both programmatically and conditionally through the blockchain. Other important concepts include trustless transactions which may well do away with institutions as we know them and proof-of-work which provides a hurdle big enough to prevent users from changing records or the blockchain without redoing every transactions on the blockchain.\n\nGoing into 2015, blockchain technology is going to move out of its original money-related beginnings into new ideas that may not as yet have been envisioned. And to answer the question raised in the title of the article, it [the use of the bitcoin blockchain] will change the way we interact with databases in the future. It will require the learning of new methods of programming, new approaches to contracts, business processes and even governance itself. The onus, therefore, is on professionals to begin moving into the emerging brave crypto world.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
01/03/2015,"['So, it happened. After some time moving in a narrow range in the low $300s, Bitcoin price has plunged below $300. This new Bitcoin price crash at the beginning of 2015 is is a continuation of the downward trend of last year – in 2014, Bitcoin has been the worst performing currency in the world, as far as the price charts are concerned. Though, if you just open your mind to a 14-month window instead of a 12-month window, Bitcoin Price has performed much better. Try to keep this in mind.\n\nThe year-end status of Bitcoin Price is very bad news for speculators, especially for those who purchased their bitcoins one year ago when the price was above $1000, hoping to sell at a profit soon, and have seen Bitcoin price steadily going down instead.\n\nWaiting for a more sophisticated analysis to be published soon, I wish to say once again that Bitcoin price is not important.\n\nIn 2014, Bitcoin was a very bad investment for speculators, but a very good investment for venture capitalists. They invest in cryptocurrency startups because they see that the volume of Bitcoin transactions and the adoption of Bitcoin by consumers and merchants are rising.\n\nAlso read: Forget Bitcoin Price and Bet on Bitcoin Killer Apps\n\nBitcoin Price Below $300\n\nAs CCN observed in September, use drives down price.

Analysts at the Coin Cadence Bitcoin Index compiled Bitcoin’s transaction data for the past six years. In 2014 Bitcoin Transaction Volume Doubled; growing 45.5%. Apparently, fake transaction chains could account for up to 50% of this network traffic.\n\nCritical minds in the community are quick to point out the pros and cons of using transaction volume as a metric for growth. Primarily, that a transaction can be “fake” if sending coins back to yourself to no economic end. Effectively, its taking money from your left pocket and putting it in your right. New data going back years reveals Bitcoin has a history of fake transaction chains inflating its velocity.\n\nThe transaction velocity of money is a measurement of how frequently a unit of currency is part of any transaction. Fiat transaction fees vary depending on providers. Fees for using cash are low. However, services running on top of the fiat system, like credit cards or remittance companies, charge additional processing fees.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nGaming the System with Fake Transaction Chains\n\nBitcoin fees are low, pennies, and transactions do not always require fees. Falsifying transactions makes Bitcoin’s velocity appear higher than it is. Unless you are a Keynesian, sending a transaction that moves bitcoins from one address you control to another is not economic activity. Bitcoin transaction volume may have doubled in 2014, how much of that usage was genuine?\n\nyCombinator user sanswork found what they believed to be tens of thousands of fake bitcoin transaction volume.

In the off-record conversation, the exec had something disturbing to say: bitcoin’s falling volatility is causing problems for exchanges, which rely on volatility for trading volume. Without trading volume, their revenues will fall, leading to a shakeout in 2015.\n\nThat’s scary stuff, but does it hold up? Let’s start with the link between volatility and volume.\n\nVolatility means volume\n\n“Volatility is positively correlated to trading volume in all markets, not just the bitcoin market,” said Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of New York-based exchange Coinsetter. “This is not a unique characteristic of our space, but rather a fundamental tendency of trading in general.”\n\nOthers have numbers to back that up. Joseph Lee, CEO of bitcoin derivatives platform BTC.sx, took daily highs and lows from Bitstamp’s trading data, and used it to calculate the variation from the day’s weighted price.\n\n“What we see very transparently is the direct correlation between price movement (volatility) and trading volume. This remains true across all exchanges in this space,” he said.\n\nJeremy Glaros, CEO of Coinarch, which offers bitcoin-based derivatives, found similar results. He mapped intra-day price ranges at several exchanges against total market volumes and found a strong link.\n\nHe said:\n\n“The statistical relationship looks quite strong, with an R-squared value of 75%. One hundred percent would imply that the volatility completely explains volume and 0% would say it has nothing to do with it at all.”\n\nVolatility and exchanges\n\nSo, volatility does equal volume. But is volatility really shrinking? Over at the Bitcoin Volatility Index, we can see volatility at relative lows from May 2014, when compared to bitcoin’s history from late in 2010.\n\nEli Dourado, a research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, created the Volatility Index. He offered this theory as to why volatility has slipped:\n\n“Bitcoin volatility has gone down because of the growing ecosystem. There are more sophisticated players who are doing more hedging and providing more liquidity to the market.”\n\nGenerally speaking, exchanges love volatility, said Gerald Cotten, CEO of Vancouver-based exchange QuadrigaCX. Conversely, things are harder for them when the prices paddle in the shallows.\n\n“Large price swings in either direction typically result in higher trading volumes on exchanges, and therefore higher profits,” Cotten said. “When the price is flat, the total volume traded is definitely lower, which does have a negative impact on profits.”\n\nDoes this mean that revenue is going to plummet for exchanges if this continues?\n\nThat depends on a few factors, experts suggest. One of them is where the exchanges are based, according to BTC.SX’s Lee. Typically, exchanges that make their money from trading fees of between 0.1% and 0.6%, he said, making it relatively easy to calculate their profitability.\n\n“The exchanges based out of China prefer a revenue model of 0% fees on trading volume, but instead charge on deposits and withdrawals,” he said. “The correlation in these cases may not be as direct. Profit figures in these cases would be more difficult to ascertain.”\n\nNot all exchanges are equal\n\nAn exchange’s fortunes in the light of bitcoin volatility also depend on the services that it offers. Charles Hoskinson, former CEO of the Ethereum decentralised application platform and developer of an Udemy online course on bitcoin, argues that exchanges have recourse to many mitigation options.\n\n“It depends on products that exchanges are offering,” he said. “What about bitcoin to ripple, or to litecoin, or doge? Those things exist still and there are value-added features in exchange models. You can diversify to stay relevant.”\n\nAltcoins are a high-margin area of trade, Hoskinson suggested. There are some exchanges, such as Vault of Satoshi, that have been aggressive with altcoin trading services.\n\nThe diversification options don’t just stop with altcoins, though.\n\n“We’ve noticed that stability brings the opportunity to increase profits in other areas of our business,” said QuadrigaCX’s Cotten. “For example, we offer merchant services that are basically like BitPay's, but more focused on the Canadian market. When volatility cools down, we usually see a higher volume of merchant transactions.”\n\nThe other option is to offer derivatives, which can increase the complexity and depth of the market and offer more hedging opportunities. However, Hoskinson points to a tight regulatory environment as a barrier here.\n\nSo, whether or not there’s a shakeout in exchanges depends on several factors. Clearly, how stable bitcoin’s prices remain in the future will be one of them. Secondly, how much they hedge risk by diversifying their revenue models will be another.\n\nNatural selection\n\nPerhaps some exchanges should go, suggests CoinArch’s Glaros. “Some competition is good to be sure, but a highly fragmented market like this risks more defaults and more bad actors, which is I think bad for users overall,” he said.\n\nHoskinson argues that too fragmented a market can damage intra-exchange liquidity by dividing too few traders among too many exchanges.\n\nIf there is a shakeout, then there may be some good to come of it, suggests Dourado.\n\n“Even if the reduction in volatility is bad for bitcoin as a speculative asset, it’s good for bitcoin as a currency,” he concluded. “Exchanges might gain business because of wider bitcoin adoption, even though they’re losing business from speculative trading now.”\n\nBitcoin’s volatility could spike tomorrow, of course, which would give exchanges with narrowly focused service and revenue models a welcome shot in the arm.\n\nIn case it doesn’t, though, wouldn’t it be sensible to hedge the risk and create a broader portfolio of services?\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, CoinDesk.\n\nClosed sign image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Chat logs posted by a pump group, which appears to have been contracted to push the coin, revealed the plan.\n\nBitBay was designed to bring over many of the features found in BlackCoin. It was primarily developed by Dave Zimbeck, who sits on the BlackCoin Foundation Board and is responsible for the creation of Black/BitHalo and the often-delayed NightTrader decentralized market. BlackHalo and BitHalo were designed to use a double-deposit system to bring workable smart contracts to the cryptocurrency world and decentralized markets.\n\nBter hyped BitBay and was the primary exchange used for its ICO, although some coins were also sold on Bittrex. The ICO for 3,000 BTC appeared to sell out, which would have been extremely impressive for a new coin in the current market.\n\nAllegedly, the plan was to “buy up” 1,500 BTC worth of the ICO through Bter\'s system, including a few hundred BTC orders that had no actual BTC to back them, in order to establish a certain price point before slowly dropping at least some of the coins. Chat logs CoinTelegraph have been shown seem to indicate that the agreed upon plan was to sell the coins slowly, to avoid crashing the coin.\n\nAs regularly happens during these kind of situations, the participants argued about money. Eventually, the pump group— run by a man known as “BobSurplus” on the Bitcoin Talk Forums, and his partner who goes by the name “Gekko” in the chat logs — eventually decided to blow up the plan. They sold their coins and posted the chat logs in order to discredit both Zimbeck and Bter.\n\n[2014-11-03 1:38:58 PM] *** International Rob has shared contact details with linhan.ee. ***\n\n[2014-11-05 11:06:03 AM] *** Call to linhan.ee, duration 13:43. ***\n\n[2014-11-11 9:36:33 AM] linhan.ee: Hi bob, would you please let me know your deposit account?\n\n[2014-11-11 9:37:14 AM] International Rob: 13h3WoCnqYAP8cSF4J8bRke59EKNXKCGoK\n\n[2014-11-11 9:37:48 AM] International Rob: Is that what you mean?\n\n[2014-11-11 9:38:01 AM] International Rob: my btc address\n\n[2014-11-11 9:39:31 AM] linhan.ee: got it thanks\n\n[2014-11-11 9:41:10 AM] linhan.ee: one thing concerns me. We promise people to release funds after ICO. If you expose this address with transactions later to people, they will know we release the funds early\n\n[2014-11-11 9:41:29 AM] International Rob: no the address is new and no one will know it\n\n[2014-11-11 9:41:35 AM] linhan.ee: great\n\n[2014-11-11 9:41:48 AM] International Rob: the btc are being used to help pumop the price.. buy more coins and set support as well\n\n[2014-11-11 9:41:58 AM] linhan.ee: so don\'t expose it\n\n[2014-11-11 9:41:59 AM] International Rob: Its not my first ICO or coin eh\n\nUnconfirmed complaints from users claiming to be a part of BobSurplus\'s group have surfaced. They say the deal caused them to lose significant amounts of money. The pump group that bobsurplus runs has a 2.5 BTC monthly membership fee. The idea is that eager investors will pay him to give them information on which coin will be rising in value shortly. The group then invests in the coin together, greatly increasing its price before the groups hop out.\n\nThese kinds of market manipulation tactics would likely be illegal in most traditional financial markets, but cryptocurrencies have no such official regulation. The plan is often used by penny-stock investors. As in that market, the investors who are a part of the group have to trust that bobsurplus won\'t sell his coins early, or they could find themselves on the wrong side of the pump.\n\nThis allegedly is what happened with BitBay. The dump started as soon as the ICO went live, and the members of BobSurplus\' pump group, who had been told to buy the ICO, ended up holding a bunch of coins few actually wanted. BobSurplus received his group’s BTC investment back from Bter, saying he had to return it to them. The unconfirmed complaints state that he never returned it to them.\n\nFor its part, Bter is once again involved in a scandal. The exchange was the subject of a hack a few months back, losing over 50 million NXT in the process. The exchange managed to negotiate the return of most of the NXT, but at a cost of 300 to 400 BTC according to our sources. It is unclear where exactly those funds came from (again, Bter did not respond to requests for comment). It has been suggested that the BitBay “plan” may have been an attempt to refill their coffers after such a significant loss, but this cannot be confirmed without Bter\'s cooperation.\n\nIt is possible that Bter initially just wanted PR for their coin, but it is clear from the chat logs provided to CoinTelegraph that they did have knowledge of the plan and actively participated in it. Ignoring the ethical question of how responsible it is for an exchange to be heavily involved in the creation of a coin, artificially pumping that coin would be a clear-cut example of defrauding investors.\n\nSpencer Lievens of Sterlingcoin has had misgivings about centralized exchanges. When asked to comment on what he thinks of Bter\'s actions, he gave this quote:\n\n“The recent actions of Bter concerning BitBay is another example as to why it is of paramount importance to have decentralised exchanges. Decentralised cryptographic currencies deserve to be traded on equally decentralised platforms.”\n\nI have reached out to all three parties involved. At press time, Zimbeck has been the only one willing to speak to me. He has shown me several chat logs where he discussed concern about effects on his reputation. He stated on more than one occasion that he didn\'t want his name attached to a pump-and-dump scheme, artificial or not.\n\nEarly chats between Zimbeck and a “Chinese investor” show that the Chinese investor and Bter promised a lot: A coin that wouldn\'t be dumped, one with connections to the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and one that will have a team of developers in addition to himself.\n\nWith those promises, along with a 100 BTC advance, he agreed to have his name attached to the coin, but it appears he was initially against a pump scheme.\n\n[10/27/2014 10:34:33 PM] David Zimbeck: So you will be in this for the long run?\n\n[10/27/2014 10:34:34 PM] ******* dai: sir\n\n[10/27/2014 10:34:40 PM] David Zimbeck: its not just a pump\n\n[10/27/2014 10:35:28 PM] ******* dai: i worked at alibaba as a product manager before\n\n[10/27/2014 10:35:38 PM]******* dai: yes sir, this will be our long term Project.\n\n[10/27/2014 10:35:48 PM] David Zimbeck: yes\n\n[10/27/2014 10:35:53 PM]****** dai: we do not want this be a pump and dump Project.\n\n[10/27/2014 10:36:02 PM] David Zimbeck: that makes me very happy\n\nAt a certain point however, Zimbeck became aware of the scheme and admits that he worked to disguise both the scheme and his awareness of it. He also accepted a significant portion of BitBay after knowing of the ICO scam. He claims that he only became aware of the scheme as the ICO went live, after it was too late to warn investors. According to Zimbeck, at that point he was in a panic, unsure what he could do to protect investors and his reputation, so he publicly denied the pump plan. He felt dumping his portion of the Bay would have made him look guilty and further hurt the coin\'s value. He never dumped his Bay and stated in his official comment that it would be used for bounties.\n\nThere does appear to be a smoking gun that does show Zimbeck knew at least of a pump plan before the ICO went live , some evidence that Zimbeck was aware of a pump before he admitted it publicly but not necessarily before the ICO went live or that it was done with artificial orders.\n\n[2014-12-04 8:52:56 PM] International Rob: yoyoyoyoo\n\n[2014-12-04 8:52:58 PM] International Rob: david\n\n[2014-12-04 8:53:02 PM] International Rob: how was ur bday man?\n\n[2014-12-04 8:58:20 PM] International Rob: hey bro\n\n[2014-12-04 8:58:31 PM] International Rob: please hit me up before you release the new wallet\n\n[2014-12-04 8:58:35 PM] International Rob: were gonna set up a pump\n\n[2014-12-04 8:58:42 PM] International Rob: so we all need to be working on the same timetable\n\n[2014-12-04 11:45:13 PM] International Rob: heyaaaa\n\n[2014-12-04 11:45:16 PM] International Rob: you around yet?\n\n[12:38:47 AM] David Zimbeck: hey Rob saw your message. I\'m doing a build which should be avail today or tomorrow\n\n[12:39:42 AM] David Zimbeck: I\'m here meeting Steven in Thailand so its possible we may not find a convenient time\n\nIt is worth pointing out that Zimbeck never responded to the comment about the pump directly and didn’t reply at all until three hours later, and then about a different subject. Still, it seems unlikely that he completely missed that comment.\n\nPump and dump schemes are common in cryptocurrencies. Some would even argue that they are a part of the ecosystem at this point, regardless of their legality. However, a pump and dump using actual purchases to inflate the price and a pump and dump that uses fake purchases to artificially increase the price are two different beasts. Both are amoral actions that prey on the naive, but one is a virtually accepted practice that comes with the territory and the other is a new scheme. While both are manipulations of investors, one is at least actual manipulation, the other is creating a market out of whole cloth.\n\nExactly when Zimbeck knew the orders were going to be fake is not clear. But it does appear that he knew, or at least should have known, that the ICO would be pumped prior to its release, and that will be enough to ruin his reputation in the eyes of many.\n\nbobsurplus and his partner Gekko are shown in the chat asking for more money, money that was previously earmarked for development purposes. According to the chat logs shown to CoinTelegraph, threats were made, and attempts (some successful according to sources) of blackmail and extortion aimed at Bter took place. Eventually, the two decided to abandon Bter and Zimbeck, discrediting them while knowing they had little reputation to lose themselves.\n\nDespite advocating for the coin publicly, including to the pump group he runs, Bob and Gekko threatened to destroy the coin by using their knowledge of the underhanded dealings they were seemingly heavily involved in.\n\n[11/28/2014 1:18:26 PM] Gekko: We don\'t need halo\n\n[11/28/2014 1:18:33 PM] David Zimbeck: sure you do\n\n[11/28/2014 1:18:41 PM] David Zimbeck: you dont have a coin without dev\n\n[11/28/2014 1:18:42 PM] Gekko: I can say anything I want to push the price\n\n[11/28/2014 1:18:51 PM] David Zimbeck: yeah but people wont listen\n\n[11/28/2014 1:18:55 PM] David Zimbeck: thats pump and dump\n\n[11/28/2014 1:19:00 PM] David Zimbeck: people are tired of that\n\n[11/28/2014 1:19:02 PM] Gekko: Want to bet?\n\nOther altcoin developers have talked to CoinTelegraph about BobsSurplus; none admitted to working with him. They all told similar stories of Bob offering to artificially pump their ICO in a manner similar to this plan, except the BitBay plan had the additional layer of an exchange\'s involvement.\n\nPrior to this, Zimbeck had been quickly gaining a reputation as a talented coder in the cryptocurrency community. BitHalo is still arguably the most reliable smart-contract system available to Bitcoin users. For decentralized markets dealing in physical goods, it is still one of the only solutions providing a viable way to prevent fraud.\n\nUnfortunately, he didn\'t come forward until it was too late, after the entire plan was exposed, and this failure will likely tarnish his name in some people\'s eyes forever. However, the chat logs provided to CoinTelegraph seem to exonerate him at least from the initial formation of the plan, and even seem to indicate that he was at one point misled. According to the logs, he did in fact fight for increased development on the coin throughout. The chat logs also seem to indicate that Zimbeck and the pump group had no communication until a few days before the ICO.\n\nAs for BitBay, Zimbeck promises to continue his work on it, eventually incorporating the smart contracts and decentralized marketplaces found in BitHalo, NightTrader and BlackCoin. He is also promising price pegging, which (one way or another) should help the price. He has promised to continue developing BitBay. Bter, for what it is worth, has agreed to help. According to Zimbeck\'s official statement there will be a 1:1 exchange and Dai (the Chinese investor) has promised an additional 100 BTC toward the developer funds. Of course, this indicates that many of the same people who were behind the pump, or at least participated in it, will still be involved with the coin.\n\nZimbeck and Bter will be judged by the community, and their relevance moving forward depends on how forgiving the community is. Guilt can arguably be found in all parties involved. Zimbeck was the only one willing to speak to me. He is also the only one who had the naivete to put his name on the project publicly. Those two facts alone should lend him some level of credence. Questions still remain, and the ones that have answers aren’t pretty. In the future, it will be up to investors to decide whether his talents hold more weight than this fiasco.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

El 3 de enero de 2009, a las 18:15:05 horas (GMT) se genera el primer bloque de la cadena de bloques de Bitcoin. Es el bloque Génesis (Genesis block, en inglés) y es en ese momento exactamente cuando empieza a funcionar la red Bitcoin. En aquel momento, recién estrenado el año 2009, muy poca gente era consciente de lo que aquello implicaba, y fue un hecho que pasó totalmente desapercibido. Hoy, 3 de enero de 2015, se cumplen seis años exactos de aquel momento y, aunque aún este hecho pase desapercibido para muchos, una mayor cantidad de personas en todo el planeta son más conscientes de este aniversario.\n\nSeis días después de extraerse el primer bloque, el 9 de enero 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mandaba un email “anunciando la primera versión de Bitcoin, un nuevo sistema de dinero electrónico que utiliza una red peer-to-peer en la que el doble doble gasto de un activo digital no era posible. Es completamente descentralizada y sin ningún servidor o autoridad central” y en el que explicaba cómo descargarse el software desde Bitcoin.org, dominio que se había comprado el 18 de agosto de 2008.\n\nEse dominio se había utilizado por primera vez el 1 de noviembre de 2008 para publicar el paper titulado “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” y que Nakamoto había anunciado en la lista de correo de criptografía meltzdown.com.\n\nEl primer bloque tenía una recompensa de 50 bitcoins, llamada coinbase para las recompensas de los nuevos bloques, y la recibió la dirección pública Bitcoin 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. Esos bitcoins no pueden ser gastados por un detalle técnico de cómo se genero el bloque Génesis. Si analizamos a día de hoy esa dirección, y todos los movimientos que ha habido en ella desde que se generara la primera entrada de 50 bitcoins el 3 de enero de 2009, podemos ver todos los movimientos han sido ingresos y que no se han sacado nunca bitcoins de esa cuenta.\n\nEl bloque Génesis es la admiración colectiva por los logros de Satoshi Nakamoto en la comunidad Bitcoin porque, para que alguien tuviera la capacidad de demostrar que es Satoshi Nakamoto, solamente tendría que firmar un mensaje con un bitcoin generado desde el bloque Génesis con su clave privada y con eso quedaría demostrado muy probablemente que se trata de Satoshi, si nadie le hubiera extraído su clave privada antes.\n\nEl bloque Génesis contiene además esta frase “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” que traducido al español significa “El Times 03/Ene/2009 Canciller a punto de segundo rescate para los bancos”. Todos los mineros que consiguen minar un nuevo bloque tienen la capacidad de insertar un texto en el bloque y parece ser que Satoshi decidió utilizar este titular del The Times para demostrar que el primer bloque no se generó antes del 3 de enero 2009. El periódico en cuestión se ha convertido en un objeto de colección entre fanáticos y parece ser que el periódico ya no se encuentra en el mercado a no ser que sea a precios desorbitados.\n\nBloque Génesis de Bitcoin\n\nEl segundo movimiento que se generó en esa dirección fue el 13 de mayo de 2011 a las 21:04:05 horas, y fue una transferencia a su favor de 0,01 BTC. Es curioso, porque es precisamente unos días antes a esas fechas, el 23 de abril de 2011, cuando se tienen las últimas noticias de Satoshi Nakamoto, creador de la criptomoneda, que en un email, escribía a otro desarrollador diciendo que “se ha movido a otras cosas”. Desde entonces no se ha vuelto a leer nada escrito por él.\n\nEn la actualidad, la dirección a la que se generó el primer bloque de la red P2P Bitcoin tiene un total de 65,39125463 BTC (alrededor de 21.000 dólares al cambio actual), y la última transferencia la recibió el 19 de noviembre 2014, a las 6:59:02 horas.\n\nEPL\n\n© OroyFinanzas.com', ""MaidSafe founder David Irvine asked the U.S. government in June 2014 to create and enforce a monopoly on his behalf. On January 1 of this year, the U.S. government agreed to do so. The monopolistic grab goes by another name, too: patent.\n\nThe following computing process is what Irvine now claims he owns:\n\n“A method of storing data from a first node on a peer-to-peer network. The method includes creating a public and private key pair for a data item. The method also includes determining a hash value for the public key and assigning the hash value as a user identifier for the user of the node. The method also includes storing the public key within a distributed hash table of the peer-to-peer network. The user identifier corresponds to the key for the public key within the distributed hash table.”\n\nIrony among Ironies\n\nWill Irvine attempt to say that the patent applies to the unreleased MaidSafe protocol? It’s unclear. But if he does, the irony goes deep.\n\nMaidSafe bills itself, among other things, as a network to protect users from online spying. Thanks to Edward Snowden’s leaks, the U.S. government’s “National Security Agency” (NSA) is now well known as the largest spy network in the world.\n\nIn other words, Irvine may well be asking the spies to help him protect you from their spying.\n\nBad Ideas not yet Dead\n\nOnce upon a time, many people believed that unless monopolies (patents) on ideas were enforced, no one would have any incentive to come up with any new ideas. Crazy, I know.\n\nThen folks like Satoshi Nakamoto came around and proved that you can actually become a billionaire while giving away your ideas (making them “free and open source”). In fact, all cryptocurrencies prove that proper incentives definitely exist outside government interference. Most of the great ideas in the history of the world were released without patents.\n\nBut it would seem that in spite of all the evidence, some like Irvine are still less interested in honestly marketing a product than they are in leveraging the (dying) power of monopolization.\n\nMarket Response\n\nAgain, it’s not entirely clear if the networking process that Irvine’s attempting to monopolize will have any effect on MaidSafe’s future users (should the code ever be released). Many certainly hope that it will, as MaidSafe was given over US$7 million dollars by the crypto community earlier this year to deliver their product.\n\nIf the monopolization attempt does affect MaidSafe, there is a fitting response. Most in the crypto community believe in self-regulation. If you believe that Irvine’s patent-seeking will negatively affect the MaidSafe network, the best way you can express that is to not use it and tell others to steer clear, as well.\n\nWhat do you think of Irvine’s move? Share in the comments below.\n\n[Edit: The code for MaidSafe has, in fact, been released. The mistaken reporting that it had not been was due to the download being unavailable on the MaidSafe website. The code is, in fact, available on MaidSafe's GitHub. Apologies are made for this error and thanks are given to those who pointed it out. The network is in testing phase, however, and has not launched.]\n\nDid you enjoy this article? You may also be interested in reading these ones:"", 'The tech industry constantly unleashes thrilling ideas that race through the population like pink eye in a preschool. Some of them, like e-commerce and the Long Tail, have staying power. Others look silly in the rearview mirror—burning millions of dollars to gain “eyeballs” did not continue to be an admirable business strategy after the dot-com bubble burst.\n\nWith such perspective, here are eight buzzy tech trends/ideas to watch in 2015, the 20th anniversary of the Internet’s big bang: Netscape’s IPO.\n\n1. “We’re the Uber of…” (insert any profession, from clowns to canola farmers)\n\nNo company gets more attention today than Uber. It’s changing personal transportation. It’s getting in fights and stirring up shit-storms all over the world. It’s worth $41 billion. So, of course, every startup team wants to sprinkle a little Uber dust on itself. GlamSquad, which lets users tap an app to get a hairstylist to do a house call, dubbed itself “sort of an Uber for women’s haircuts.” BloomThat calls itself the Uber for flowers. GreenPal’s CEO described his company as an Uber for lawn care.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe problem there is that Uber’s greater goal is to eventually be the Uber of every goddamn thing. Much the way Amazon started with books and usurped most of retail, Uber will start with taxis and snort up whatever might seem as if it should be Uberized, whether it is haircuts, flowers, lawn work or clowns. And the company seems mean enough to do it. Watch this space for a lot of Drugstore.com and Pets.com roadkill.\n\n2. All companies are now software companies\n\nIn 2011, super-investor Marc Andreessen penned a CEO-rattling op-ed about “why software is eating the world.” The thrust was that software is replacing or revolutionizing everything that used to be done with hardware or physical stuff, whether it is TV, medicine or money.\n\nThis has proved to be largely true, and CEOs have progressed from denial to conversion. So today we’re seeing companies declare that—holy smokes!—they are software companies after all! Or, as Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff teased from the stage of his massive convention this fall, “if you weren’t a software company before, you are one now.”\n\nEven the Girl Scouts succumbed, finally letting its members sell Girl Scout cookies online. If your kid is still hawking Thin Mints door-to-door, she might as well pack up her sash and see if she can get a job as a telephone switchboard operator. This is no fad. Software will inexorably march through one industry after another in 2015 and beyond, unless the North Koreans destroy all of America’s computers. Then every company will be a hand-cranked company.\n\n3. Business at the speed of thought\n\nThis phrase was the title of Bill Gates’s 1999 book, and now seems to be uttered everywhere in business conversation, much like “innovator’s dilemma” a decade ago. It’s supposed to conjure up super-fast actions in a highly networked age. But this sounds like a really bad idea. Given how scattered our thoughts are, acting instantly on all of them would result in corporate strategy as disjointed as Snooki’s Twitter feed. Lord knows, executives could use a little more Dalai Lama and a little less Microsoft philosophy. How ’bout “business at the speed of mindfulness”?\n\nLook for the “speed of thought” phrase to become a cringe-worthy cliché by year’s end.\n\n4. Big stinkin’ phones will get bigger\n\nGoogle’s Nexus 6 is supposed to be a phone, but it’s practically as big as a wok. Put it in your inside jacket pocket and it looks as if you’re wearing half a bulletproof vest. Phone sizes are getting bigger faster. “It took five years for the average screen size to get from three inches to four inches, but only two more to get to the current average of five inches,” notes Alex Barredo, who analyzed data on 7,000 phone models.\n\nWhat’s driving this? A younger generation, in particular, is using the phone for almost everything that formerly belonged on the laptop: Web searching, Facebooking, movie watching. So it makes sense that they’d want a larger screen, as long as it can awkwardly make a call in an emergency, like when they have to ask their father for money. At least that’s been my experience.\n\nBut the trend can’t continue or phones will soon end up as big as laptops. And then some college-age genius will have an epiphany that it would be really cool to have a connected device you could carry in your shirt pocket, as if that never happened before. Then we’ll go back to square one.\n\n5. Cable TV is finished\n\nHBO and CBS dove into streaming in 2014. Every other significant programmer will follow in 2015. Cable companies have overpriced and under-serviced their way to a level of consumer disgust unmatched by almost any industry in history. No one will weep for Comcast.\n\n6. We’ll see the first trillion-dollar company\n\nApple is closing in on a market cap of $700 billion. OK, so it’s still $300 billion away from $1 trillion, which is like Apple growing both a Facebook and an Amazon to get there. Still, if stocks keep climbing and Tim Cook doesn’t screw up, Apple could pass that milestone soon. U.S. Steel became the first billion-dollar company in 1901. We’ve been waiting 114 years to get to the next level.\n\n7. Bitcoin is dead; long live Bitcoin\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin in 2014 was like using your money as cat litter: $940 for a Bitcoin in January dove to $330 in December. But while the mania for Bitcoin as an investment might be over, most every venture capitalist says that startups in payments and financial technology are their hottest investments right now—and the potential of the technology behind Bitcoin is a big reason. Banks and credit card companies might be heading for the same rough ride that’s ahead for the cable companies.\n\n8. Clickbait is dead\n\nWhat? You mean like arbitrary lists cynically aimed at luring eyeballs? No way.', '?????????????????????????????????????????????Bitcoin??77????Bitcoin??Lee???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????""Best B#$*h""??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????MV????????????????????????????????Bitcoin?????????????????????????????????????80????????Bitcoin????????????https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=md4cPHFBeiU??????????????????Glaucoma???????Nap Time??????????????????????????????????Doggy Style???????????????????????????????Rappin Like a Black Dude???????????????????????Bitcoin????????????????????????????????????????? ??YouTube??????????????????????????????????????????????????????Bitcoin is a white, 77-year-old rapper-and he rules', 'The Great Fallacy at the Heart of Modern Monetary Theory\n\nAs with all theories that miss the mark, Modern Monetary Theory presents some insights into the matter of course, but seems to hinge on one or two key assumptions that are more matters of assertion than historical or even practical experience. It is founded not so much an economic theory, but on a belief without a firm foundation.\n\nThis paragraph taken from Yves Smith\'s recent article about MMT\n\n""The sovereign government cannot become insolvent in its own currency; it can always make all payments as they come due in its own currency because it is the ISSUER of the currency, not simply the USER (as a household or private business is).\n\n\n\nThis issuing capacity means that the government does not face the same kinds of constraints as a private sector user of money, which in turn exposes the fallacy of the household analogy, so beloved in popular economics discourse.""\n\n\n\nThe finances of a sovereign are most assuredly NOT like those of a household. And those of a Bank are not like a household either.\n\n\n\nIn several ways they can be the inverse of a household in their motivations. For example, when household spending is slack because of an economic shock, the government may wish to engage in more spending to counteract this. Some think it is the role of government to keep the economy out of what is called a liquidity trap or as I understand it a feedback loop of cutbacks that greatly exacerbate the problem of slack demand.\n\n\n\nThis is one of the points of having a government, that is, to do things that the individual cannot do well alone, no matter how powerful they may think that they are, and to protect the rights of the many from those who are more powerful, both foreign and domestic.\n\n\n\nBut here is the matter of disputation, emphasis in caps theirs, in italics mine. ""The sovereign government cannot become insolvent in its own currency; it can always make all payments as they come due in its own currency because it is the ISSUER of the currency, not simply the USER.""\n\n\n\nDo you see what is missing here, and more importantly, what is implied?\n\n\n\nWhat is missing is the acknowledgement that the users of a currency, call them \'the market,\' can and will and have quite often throughout history questioned the valuation of a currency, and often to the point of practical worthlessness, if certain actions are taken by the sovereign in creating their currency.\n\nThis speaks to a principle that I spelled out some time ago, that the practical limit on a sovereign government in printing money is the willingness of the market to accept it at a certain value. And this applies to any sovereign, more readily perhaps if they are smaller and weaker, but always given time nonetheless.\n\n\n\nIf Russia, for example, were to merely start printing more rubles and set a target valuation for them, they could enforce this internally. And in fact, many sovereigns have done so throughout history. I remember visiting Moscow shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, and marveling at the disconnect between the official stated valuations and the actions of the ordinary people in seeking alternatives like the US Dollar, gold, diamonds, and even Western style toilet paper, a more useful sort of paper than the ruble.\n\n\n\nTechnically Russia could not become insolvent in rubles, because they could always print more of them to pay all their debts, make purchases, and salary payments. The great caveat in this is that Russia had to maintain a measure of control and enforcement to make that principle \'stick.\'\n\n\n\nAnd this is what probably makes MMT inadvertently statist, and dangerous. That is because this belief only works within a domain in which the state exercises complete control over valuation.\n\n\n\nIn the case of the US dollar as a global reserve currency, if this theory is applied, and one of my great fears is that it will be, then there is an inherent need for the Dollar Cartel to continuing expanding their span of control over all of the producing and purchasing world, in order to enforce this belief.\n\n\n\nI am sorry to have to disagree with people whom I like and enjoy reading, but as you can see I think there is an important point of disagreement here. And given the number of sovereigns who have defaulted, causing significant pain in their people and in the lives of others, it is not a trivial thing.\n\n\n\nI suppose that there are many other things in MMT that are correct, as it seems to be quite the usual thing in many ways, but there is an important exception in the assertion that the state has no limit to its power to set value, because that is exactly what is implied in the canard that a sovereign cannot default in its own currency. Technically it cannot because it can always print more than enough pay off debts and make more purchases. But it can create money in such a way as to break the confidence of the market, and call its valuation into question. And this is a de facto default.\n\n\n\nWhat happens when the people refuse to accept it at their stated value? What happens to people who do not agree that the State can do no wrong? Because if the State can never be at fault in creating and spending money, that makes it a problem and a source of great mischief.\n\nIn the historical examples the government always resorts to force of some sort in varying degrees, and official exchange rates, and other actions not only on their own people but on their neighboring sovereigns who refuse to submit to the valuation of a currency by official diktat.\n\n\n\nIt is a dangerous statement that might be remedied by an acknowledgement that there are practical limitations on the power of the State in creating money, and that it is related to the willing acceptance and confidence of the people in its fairness and justice, and especially people who are not part of that same economic sphere of influence. And if the adherents of a belief cannot agree with this, then it calls into question all the other aspects of a belief that is based on such an absurdity a priori principle.\n\nSo it was with the \'efficient market hypothesis,\' which believed that people acting in a group are naturally good and rational, and therefore needed little or no regulation. It was widely accepted in economic circles, and those who did not accept it were dismissed as unsophisticated. And it did not matter that this assumption was shown to be blatantly incorrect to anyone who is familiar with the reality of the marketplace, or has ever driven on a modern high speed motorway.\n\nPeople on the whole are not naturally rational, good, and self-regulating to a degree sufficient to permit with the dispensation of the rule of law. If only this were true! And a persistent minority among them are so much not inclined to the good as to be sociopaths and inclined to be criminals.\n\n\n\nAnd unfortunately politicians who act for the State are not angelically good and beneficent either. But this is what is implied in creating a system that allows for their acquiring and exercising almost unlimited power that is beyond question, in money or in anything else, but in particular something as important as the general means of exchange and valuation.\n\nBy Jesse\n\nhttp://jessescrossroadscafe.blogspot.com\n\nWelcome to Jesse\'s Café Américain - These are personal observations about the economy and the markets.

01/04/2015,"['2014 was a bad year for people who own bitcoins, with the cryptocurrency losing nearly 60 percent of its value. And 2015 is off to an even worse start. We\'re less than a week into the new year, and the value of one bitcoin has already fallen about 15 percent, from $320 to around $270:\n\nIt\'s a mistake to read too much into short-term fluctuations in Bitcoin\'s value. As bad as the last year has been, the currency has been in worse shape before. It fell more than 90 percent between June and November of 2011, for example. Still, Bitcoin\'s continued slide is reason to ask hard questions about the network\'s long-term future.\n\nIn the past, fluctuations in Bitcoin\'s value were largely driven by media attention, which in turn drove a speculative boom. People became convinced that the Bitcoin network would be big and important in the future, and so they bought bitcoins in hopes of cashing in on that expected future growth.\n\nBut that kind of speculative cycle can\'t drive the Bitcoin economy forever. Sooner or later, the Bitcoin community is going to have to find applications that appeal to ordinary people — like making everyday purchases or sending money around the globe\n\n2015 will be a crucial test for the alternative payment network. If Bitcoin does as poorly in 2015 as it did in 2014, a lot more people could question whether the technology really has a bright future.\n\nBitcoin is a hit with investors but not users\n\nVenture capitalists have been pouring a lot of money into Bitcoin-based startups. Coindesk has a useful list of these investments, which includes startups that help people acquire and spend bitcoins, help businesses accept them, and help people make money from ""mining,"" the process of reconciling Bitcoin transactions and earning rewards in the process. According to Coindesk, Bitcoin startups raised just $2 million in 2012. The figure rose to $94 million in 2013 and to a whopping $314 million in 2014.\n\nWith so much money being spent on new Bitcoin products and services, you might expect to see a rapid increase in Bitcoin usage. But the data suggests that so far, none of these startups has caught on with consumers in a big way:\n\nBetween January 2013 and today, the amount of money invested in Bitcoin startups has grown more than 100-fold. Even after 2014\'s declines, Bitcoins today are worth 20 times what they were worth at the start of 2013. The number of Bitcoin ATMs has gone from 0 to 342. Yet during the same two-year period, the number of Bitcoin transactions each day has not even doubled.\n\nIn short, there\'s a lot of excitement among Bitcoin hackers, Bitcoin investors, and other insiders. But normal people are hardly using the network at all.\n\nFor example, when I asked a friend who\'s heavily involved in Bitcoin which startups he\'s most excited about, he mentioned Blockstream, a startup that\'s seeking to improve the core Bitcoin architecture to help make it more compatible with other Bitcoin competitors. That could prove to be a valuable effort, but only if Bitcoin itself proves to have useful applications. And my friend had trouble naming a Bitcoin application that would appeal to mainstream audiences.\n\nWhy 2015 is a make-or-break year for Bitcoin\n\nOf course, some Bitcoin startup investments were only made a few months ago. Perhaps startups are about to unleash amazing innovations in the coming months that will prove the doubters wrong.\n\nI\'m still cautiously optimistic that this will happen. I\'ve long suspected that Bitcoin\'s first ""killer app"" will be international money transfers, and the growing number of Bitcoin ATMs around the world could be a step toward making that happen. But people have to actually start using those ATMs. And the numbers suggest that — at least so far — they\'re not.\n\nIf Bitcoin exhibits the same kind of anemic growth in 2015 it did in 2014, despite exponentially more investment, that could be a sign that the technology isn\'t as revolutionary as optimists (including me) thought. The Bitcoin network itself is in no danger of dying — the core infrastructure will survive for years even if most people lose interest in it.\n\nBut network technologies like Bitcoin are depend a lot on momentum. People invest in them because they expect them to grow rapidly. Another year of anemic growth could cause a lot of people to invest their time and resources elsewhere.\n\nAnd if Bitcoin startups invest hundreds of millions of dollars over several years and fail to develop any user-friendly applications, that might be a strong sign that the technology doesn\'t actually have any such applications.', ""Magma VC has invested $400,000 in decentralised social messaging startup GetGems (formerly Gems).\n\nThe funding marks the first VC investment for the widely anticipated crypto 2.0 project, which seeks to incentivise social messaging users through the use of GEMZ, a native token issued on Counterparty that allows users to profit from the platform’s growth.\n\nThe news comes amid GetGems’ ongoing crowdsale, the first hosted by IDG-backed decentralised application development platform Koinify. Since its 1st December launch, GetGems has raised $600,000 through the sale, bringing its total funding to roughly $1m.\n\nMagma VC general partner Ran Achituv framed the investment as just another example of how his firm is able to identify disruptive trends early. In addition to GetGems, Magma VC was an early investor in community-based traffic and navigation app Waze, which was purchased for $1.1bn by Google in 2013.\n\nAchituv told CoinDesk:\n\n”We are looking for disruption, differentiation, distribution and a great winning team. We felt Gems has very good characteristics in all four parameters. Chat and value transfer is a growing trend.”\n\nGetGems CEO Daniel Peled further expressed his belief that Magma VC would in turn increase its chances of success in the long term.\n\n“The additional funding will help us scale our company faster which is necessary since the mainstream instant messaging market is very competitive,” Peled said.\n\nAnnounced in October, the GetGems encrypted messaging service is now available on Android. Gems plans to introduce its basic iOS app, wallet and token system and advertising platform in 2015 using funds from its ongoing crowdsale.\n\nCommunity support proves essential\n\nUnlike a recent investment made by 10x Venture Partners as part of a crowdsale for e-commerce software developer Ziftr, Magma’s investment has not been made in the GEMZ tokens directly.\n\nHowever, Achituv indicated that the crowdsale did inform his team's decision to back GetGems, stating that the support of the community provided assurance of the project's viability.\n\n“We hope our investment as a well-known venture capital firm would also increase the bitcoin community as well as general public's trust in GetGems as a platform and therefore its cryptocurrency will have an increasing value,” Achituv added.\n\nFollowing its $100m fund in 2013, the Israeli seed-stage investment group raised a $150m fund in September. Achituv suggested Magma may seek to support additional startups in the digital currency field with this capital.\n\n“We believe in the blockchain and cryptocurrency as a macro trend and if the right opportunity is found we're open to investing,” he said.\n\nThe appeal of crypto 2.0\n\nWhile GetGems marks Magma’s first investment in the bitcoin ecosystem, Achituv said that the service, operated by Decentrlized Mobile Applications Ltd, was not the first from the industry his firm considered, having vetted a number of bitcoin mining companies in 2013.\n\nPerhaps most notably, however, Achituv voiced his belief that Gems was attractive as it is not wholly dependant on the price of bitcoin, but rather leverages its technological benefits to provide value for consumers.\n\n“We're looking for investments that control their destiny on their own and create new solutions and value. What we are seeing now is not directly on bitcoin, it's more trying to leverage the benefits of the technology for new use cases and capabilities,” he added.\n\nAchituv indicated that he believes GetGems could prove influential in inspiring other businesses to consider leveraging the capabilities of bitcoin in similar ways.\n\nImages via Gems\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This vault will form the basis for a new cryptocurrency bank aptly named ‘Space Bank‘, which is being described as ‘the world’s first satellite banking platform’.\n\nAccording to an official press release the futuristic new banking service will cater to users of both Bitcoin and Ven (a digital currency used by the social network and publishing platform Hub Culture).\n\nThe whole idea of a banking service based in space conjures up thoughts of the ultimate tax haven: off-world rather than just off-shore. Although SpaceBit have yet to comment on this tax situation, they have made it clear that they are not seeking to evade regulation or cater to the kind of secretive criminal clients who have often used tax havens in the past. In fact, they aim to remain “fully compliant and transparent”.\n\nPartnerships with established banks and exchanges will be key to SpaceBit’s plans for both local regulatory compliance around the world, and for establishing a truly borderless international service. To this end they aim to initiate a number of ‘prospective partnerships’ which they plan to announce in the ‘near future’.\n\nSpaceBit’s objectives are to create a secure decentralized banking system with common services for the whole planet, to support the expansion of cryptocurrency, to bring a new level of ethicality and transparency to banking, and to take cheap and secure payment systems to the world’s un-banked.\n\nThe company was founded by Pavlo Tanasyuk and Ian Angell and is said to be at the TRL5 stage of its development', 'There has been a lot of news lately about various governmental police agencies compromising websites and nodes that operate on the Tor network. The reason that this is news is that few people understand exactly what the Tor network is, how it works, or how police agencies accomplish such jobs.\n\nTor was not originally developed as a way to prevent the government from prying into the business of citizens. Tor was originally designed and deployed as a third-generation network routing project of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. In other words, the U.S. government designed the core elements of Tor.\n\nTor is by no means anonymous. The capacity of government agencies to pry into our affairs is sometimes beyond belief. If they want to use cryptographic engineering, the Utah facility of the National Security Agency (NSA), for instance, uses a Cray XC30 supercomputer, which is capable of workloads of more than 100 petaflops, or 100,000 trillion calculations per second. Simply put, no server or group of servers on the planet is capable by itself of resisting a brute force attack from this agency. However, they usually use different methods.\n\nTor does offer users more privacy than the surface net. Developers are able to create new communication tools with built-in privacy, individuals use it to keep family and friends from tracking them, journalists use it to communicate with whistleblowers, and nongovernmental organizations use it to allow workers to connect with their home office in countries that regularly monitor internet communications. Tor is also a lot more cost-effective than private VPNs.\n\nBoth criminals and dissidents use Tor, believing that they are shielded by its advertised anonymity, and their interest attracts the interest of governments. Government police and intelligence agencies use two basic methods to penetrate the Tor network:\n\nLocating and penetrating open or insecure nodes; and Inserting agents disguised as regular users into the system.\n\nThomas White, an exit-node operator on Tor, was recently forced to close down his nodes after spotting this type of penetration. White lost control of all of his servers and his ISP closed his account. While this method of attack by police has been on the uptick recently, it is still dwarfed by police inserting undercover agents into the Deep Web.\n\nThe fact is that if you are engaging in any type of illegal activity on the Deep or Dark webs, there is a good chance that you will deal with either an individual uncover agent, or come up against a sting operation. Pedophile and drug rings are often brought down using this method. The Silk Road, which was brought down by a multinational task force in 2013, is a good example of this technique. Agents were able to pose as trusted customers and then somehow get access to the servers themselves.\n\nThe takeaway from this is pretty simple. If you are planning to cruise the Dark Net for illegal substances or other contraband, be warned that you could eventually be caught up in a police net. But if you want to keep your communications private from individuals, you are probably pretty safe, at least for now. Tor is a useful tool, but like any tool, it can be poorly used by the uninformed.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Dozens of the GFI’s top desk heads and producers have expressed their concern to management in recent months about a BGC purchase, said two people familiar with the situation. Many are worried about working within BGC’s corporate culture, which incentivises employees via a partnership structure unique in the industry and could lead to bonus cuts. GFI management has agreed a cash and shares deal worth $5.25 a share with CME Group to sell itself to the US futures exchange, which will then offload the broking business to a management-led consortium. BGC, which holds a 13 per cent stake in GFI, has argued that the deal undervalues the business and has offered shareholders $5.45 per share in cash. Its proposal values GFI’s equity at $694m, but it has yet to secure a majority backing for its offer. BGC, which is led by chief executive Howard Lutnick, has extended its tender offer until January 6. Staff on longer-term contracts have sought new clauses that would enable them to quit GFI without breaching their employment terms or potentially facing legal action and losing deferred bonus payments if it is bought by BGC, said those with knowledge of the situation. “We’ve been pretty taken aback by the strength of feeling,” said a senior GFI executive who declined to be identified. “It’s not about people being precious. They see a very significant divide between the brokers.” The employees’ concerns underscore the delicate takeover negotiations for GFI, the smallest of the five main global interdealer brokers. The industry has been hit by a combination of profound regulatory reform of markets and its investment banking customers, and several years of low market volatility. Most acknowledge consolidation is needed, but antipathy and wariness among the industry’s top bosses has curbed dealmaking. Nearly 40 per cent of GFI equity is held by its management, who have pledged to back a deal with CME. Concerned employees have asked senior management for a new break clause to be inserted into their contracts under “change of control” that specifically names BGC. “We are having to look at this very seriously and very closely and are looking into our options on how to address this issue,” the senior GFI executive said. GFI Group declined to comment. BGC has promised that the deferred bonuses held by GFI employees would remain outstanding and vest on their existing schedules. BGC has also defended its employee incentive schemes, pointing out that it has made more than 21 acquisitions in 10 years without mass departures and has more than doubled the size of its business to 2,700 employees in the last decade. It also reiterated that GFI would remain a separate company for some time.', 'Jörg Dietz JANUARY 4, 2015 2 For more than a century, valuable insight into leadership, logistics, strategy, human resources, finance and other areas of management and business has emerged from research conducted at business schools. Indeed, business schools and business academics are the source of many concepts and practices that managers use on a day-to-day basis. At the same time, as their name suggests, the primary role of business schools is to educate the business managers and leaders of today and of the future. And, in an ideal world, there should be a strong link between research and teaching, where first-class research from business schools and elsewhere quickly percolates through to the students. The reality, however, is a little more complicated. Take the challenge of integrating research into the curriculum. Academic incentive structures invite research that is academically exciting but not necessarily practically relevant. Even where research has obvious application it is often not by design and at many schools there is no formal mechanism for identifying relevant research and ensuring it finds its way into the curriculum. Business schools can do more here. If we want research to be relevant to business managers and leaders we must consult with those who have an interest in research outcomes. Whether it is cross-cultural management, human resources, business strategy, or another area of interest, we can ask managers in organisations, their clients and our students, what are the questions on their minds? What problems do they need solutions for? True, these may be complex, big picture questions, which present their own challenge as research is invariably a simplification of the real world. But we can break down a big picture question into smaller researchable questions, each providing a partial answer to the big question. And to those calling for more relevant research, I do not believe all research should have immediately obvious practical applications. It would be a mistake to abandon basic research, as this can also produce great insight for practice. Take the research on heuristics — the mental short-cuts we take to speed up decision making. Much of this research has direct relevance for managers, yet early work on heuristics was not motivated by a desire to improve the performance of managers. This brings us to teaching. When it comes to including cutting-edge research ideas, there is inertia to overcome. Professors often have many ideas for updating their courses, partly to reflect relevant current research, yet often those changes do not happen — be it because of workload or risk aversion. A change of attitude is required. Instead of “If the course works, why change it?” a better approach might be, “Even if it works well, let’s consider changing it anyway”. A healthy injection of creative destruction creates opportunities for progress. Of course it is important that students acquire the appropriate knowledge on their programmes. There is a rich body of management knowledge, well established academic findings that should be and in many cases are taught to business students. However, as importantly, we can equip the business managers and leaders of the future with the tools they need to solve management problems themselves; to test ideas using evidence and experimentation. When managers implement promising solutions to business challenges, they are usually relying on intuition and emotion. If they get the results they hope for, they assume, rather than know, that it is down to their innovative approach. Students can be taught to approach problem solving like management detectives, using evidence. If a manager wants to try a new approach, they define their expected outcomes and should then challenge their suggested solution through counterfactual arguments, asking whether expected outcomes would result if the new approach were not implemented, or if alternative approaches would also produce these outcomes. This is the basis of experimental thinking. But experimental thinking on its own is not enough; experimental data are what is really needed. We teach this at HEC Lausanne, where students are encouraged to test their ideas. Through a practical experiment using randomly selected groups, two approaches to solving a business problem are compared — the old way of doing things and a new method. The results are often surprising and even counter-intuitive. It is a simple, but powerful process. Although business schools try, they may not be able to teach the latest and most relevant research findings to their students. However, what is better than having students learn and consume research produced by others is to teach these students how to produce it themselves so that it is immediately relevant to their company.

City analysts are predicting that the 47 per cent slide in the rouble over the past three months will lead to a sizeable fourth-quarter loss for BP on its Rosneft stake. They expect that loss to be as much as $750m, the first of its kind in Russia for the UK energy major. BP’s 19.75 per cent shareholding in Rosneft, acquired when the company sold its half of the TNK-BP joint venture to the Russian company in 2013, is one of its highest-profile investments and is prized for its long-term commercial value. Rosneft accounted for nearly a third of BP’s total oil and gas output and more than 8 per cent of underlying replacement cost profits — analysts’ preferred measure — for the first nine months of 2014. But the conflict in Ukraine, and sanctions imposed by the west on Moscow, have clouded those prospects, as has the near-50 per cent drop in crude prices since June. There is little sign of any let-up in oil’s fall, with fears of a supply glut in the first half of 2015 outweighing lower production from countries such as Libya. The collapse in the rouble, which at one point in December fell to nearly Rbs80 to the dollar before recovering to Rbs58 by the end of the month, would inflict considerable damage on earnings and threatened to almost wipe out a dividend payout that BP was due to receive in the middle of 2015, analysts warned. “Rosneft is almost certain to make a loss in the fourth quarter as a result of the dramatic fall in the rouble and oil price,” said Iain Reid, an energy analyst at BMO Capital Markets. The impact of the currency slide, in particular, would be “acute” as Rosneft’s debt was largely denominated in dollars and euros, and accounting rules forced the Russian company to restate this in roubles at the end of each quarter, said Mr Reid. The effect of this adjustment on BP, he argued, would be “serious”, leading to a fourth quarter loss of $630m on the Rosneft stake. Other analysts were not as bearish. The loss is expected to weigh heavily on BP’s overall profits in the fourth quarter, driving down the group’s earnings per share to as little as 5 cents, according to BMO. BP hit by Russian rouble crisis Play video Tudor Pickering Holt, the investment bank, also predicted “a massive earnings hit” for the fourth quarter, with BP incurring a loss on Rosneft of $750m. The erosion of export revenues and currency effects would take the Russian energy group’s full-year earnings “to a level which means virtually no 2015 dividend for BP”, it said. BMO expected the dividend payout, which contributes to BP’s cash flow, to fall by about 75 per cent from the $693m received in July. That is a fraction of BP’s targeted overall $30bn cash flow for 2014, however. BP may even write down the value of its equity stake in Rosneft. Under international accounting rules, this is adjusted each quarter and was $13.6bn in the group’s 2013 annual report. An updated figure will be included in the next annual report. Rosneft and BP declined to comment.

The group, which has a portfolio of so-called “home reversion plans” — a type of equity release scheme — did not give details of the securitisation, but people close to the company said it was looking to raise about £300m. Robert Palache, a senior adviser at Clifden, acknowledged that home reversion was a “non-standard asset class” but said the market mood was on the turn. “Investors are back in business and are ready to look at newer kinds of transaction,” he said. The issuance is intended to take place by the end of March. Clifden plans to use the proceeds from the bond issue, which will not be available to retail investors, to acquire more home reversion assets, acting as a consolidator in the fragmented UK equity release sector. The London-based property investor bought a portfolio of 1,203 home reversion assets from Grainger, the listed property group, for £87.6m last January. Home reversion plans allow property owners to raise cash on their homes while continuing to live there for life or until they move to a care home. With the properties distributed across the UK and valued at an average £180,000, the deal turned Clifden into the second-largest company in the market after Grainger, which continues to manage the portfolio for an annual fee and retains its own asset base. Property-related transactions dried up in the wake of the financial crisis as investors nursed deep losses on subprime home loans in the US and Europe. Unlike lifetime mortgages — another form of equity release — home reversion plans are not loans. If a homeowner sells 40 per cent of their property to the reversion company for a cash lump sum, the company receives 40 per cent of the proceeds of eventual sale, including any increase in the home’s value. The owner can stay in the property, rent-free, but is responsible for maintaining it. The profitability of the asset class for investors is highly dependent on rising house prices. Yet the spectacular price growth of the past decade in London and the southeast has softened in recent months. Figures this week from Nationwide and the Land Registry showed a cooling market across the UK, with prices rising at their slowest rate for more than a year. Mr Palache said the sector’s prospects were nonetheless strong in light of long-term factors, including a growing population and a persistent shortfall in government targets for house construction to meet demand. “There will always be dips\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but we believe there will be continuing upward pressure on house prices — for good or ill.” The people close to the company said that the most senior class of the bond had been awarded a AAA rating in due diligence undertaken by two leading credit rating agencies.']"

In an excess of caution, we are suspending service as we continue to investigate. We will return to service and amend our security measures as appropriate.\n\nWorries at silence\n\nConcerns had mounted for hours over Bitstamp\'s apparent silence. At 9:27 GMT, however, CEO Nejc Kodri? calmed some nerves by tweeting the following apology:\n\nMy sincerest apologies to those who are affected by our service being temporary suspended.

You should STOP SENDING bitcoin deposits to your Bitstamp account IMMEDIATELY as private keys of your deposit address may be lost. Your bitcoins already deposited with us are stored in a cold wallet and can not be affected. We will send you more info as soon as possible. Best regards, Bitstamp team\n\nIt also posted the following message on users\' main Account Balances page:\n\nThe phrase ""previously provided addresses"" led some to wonder if Bitstamp was suffering the kinds of problems with re-used random number values that plagued Blockchain wallets a couple of weeks ago.\n\nBitstamp\'s reputation\n\nSlovenia-based Bitstamp became the world\'s busiest USD bitcoin exchange in July 2013 when it overtook the troubled Mt Gox. It has since lost that crown to Hong Kong\'s Bitfinex. The three busiest bitcoin exchanges in the world by total BTC traded per day are BTC China, OKCoin and Huobi.\n\nThe company has generally been respected within the bitcoin community. In May 2014 it passed a proof-of-bitcoin-reserves audit overseen by BitcoinJ developer Mike Hearn, and in June it beat other bitcoin companies to win the Europas\' Best Virtual Currency Startup Award.\n\nCoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story and post updates as they become available.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, One Time Tip Link now allows registered users to send bitcoin tips directly to a person’s email address, using a one-time link.\n\nEmail or text tips\n\nIn fact, the recipient does not even have to have an email, as users can send tips via Skype or any kind of messaging service. This obviously expands the potential of using small tips to bring bitcoin to a broader audience that may or may not be tech savvy.\n\nAlthough the sender needs a social media-linked Changetip account, the recipient doesn\'t need an internet presence to receive the tip – the service also works via SMS.\n\nVictoria van Eyk, VP of community development at ChangeTip, explained:\n\n""I’ve used this feature to tip cab drivers who are interested in bitcoin, friends and to show others how easy it is to send bitcoin over different mediums. I plan on tipping some journalists tonight who may not have a Twitter handle.""\n\nAs for the tipper, using the One Time Tip Link is straightforward – users simply need to log into their ChangeTip account, click ‘One Time Tip’, set the amount and send their tip.\n\nAlternative use cases\n\nChangeTip said the use of one-time tips could create entirely new use cases for its service. The company pointed out that the community often uses its products in ways it hadn\'t anticipated.\n\nVan Eyk said:\n\n""Adam Guerbuez had a little giveaway – the first people to click his link won some money through the One Time Tip link. Martin Holland over at OurEverydayEarth.com set up an online scavenger hunt, by hiding money in posts online.""\n\nChangeTip added that the new feature could be used to devise and hold unique online contests, due to the privacy offered to both parties involved in the process.\n\nThe company maintains that it takes privacy seriously. Last month CEO Nick Sullivan told CoinDesk that the company enforces a strict privacy policy, dismissing recent criticism of its business model and off-blockchain tips in general.\n\nRoughly a month ago, the company announced the successful completion of a seed funding round, amounting to $3.5m.

This is a welcome move, and we can only hope that, to paraphrase Jimmy Carter, laws like AB129 will have the inclination to spread.\n\nAB 129 repeals Section 107 of the California Corporations Code, which prohibited any corporation, association or individual from putting in circulation as money, anything but the lawful money of the United States. The new law, therefore, paves the way for, and pre-empts the possibility of anyone construing Section 107 as prohibiting the use of, Bitcoin in the state of California.\n\nCalifornia governor, Jerry Brown signed AB 129 into law on June 28th, 2014. It was filed with the California secretary of state the same day, but it was set to take effect from this year, 2015. As previously mentioned, the bill was meant to remove a piece of California’s laws that would have rendered illegal the use of alternative currencies besides the US dollar. Other types of alternative currencies besides Bitcoin that now fall within the purview of AB 129 include gift cards, reward points such as are used at shopping malls and virtual tokens.\n\nPace of Crypto Regulation in the United States\n\nCalifornia’s action stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the nation. In 2014, the superintendent of the Depart of Financial Services in New York, became (in?)famous for his proposal on introducing Bitlicense, a move that would have seriously complicated the use of Bitcoin in the Big Apple. The move predictably caused an uproar from the Bitcoin community, and the DFS chose to open a public comment window on the proposed laws which lapsed in late 2014. Critics of the Bitlicense in its original form had charged that it would seriously infringe on the privacy rights of consumers, Bitcoin enterprises and others.\n\nIn late 2014, Congressman Steve Stockman (R-Texas) proposed a five-year moratorium on Bitcoin regulation when he introduced the HR 5777, or the Cryptocurrency Protocol Protection and Moratorium Act. The law would have frozen any statutory regulations on cryptocurrencies for a five-year period beginning June 15th, 2015. The bill is currently at the committee stage in the House of Representatives.\n\nDebate on How to Treat Bitcoin\n\nWith cryptocurrency in its infancy as an industry, the general consensus was that it would be more appropriate to hold off on regulation till such a time when Bitcoin and other digital currencies would have acquired quantum to a much more appreciable degree. At present, the only legal scaffolding that cryptocurrency would need is with respect to taxation. However even that seems to have run into headwinds over the ongoing debate on whether to look at Bitcoin as a currency or as commodity, and hence subject to VAT, sales tax, capital gains and other forms of taxation on commodities. Different jurisdictions around the world have taken different approaches. The United Kingdom has chosen the currency route. Australia has taken the view that Bitcoin is a commodity, whereas the Eurozone is still waiting for Brussels to pronounce itself on the matter.\n\nBe that as it may, cryptocurrency is developing at a brisk pace, and the revolution is being blockchained. California’s action over the AB 129 will be seen as supportive of its huge tech community, and could see the massive innovation that gave the world Silicon Valley moving to give new life to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. It could also enable the further development of blockchain technology, especially as the technology matures and moves to decouple itself from finance into other potential applications such as smart contracts, business applications and even governance itself.\n\nImages from JJKBACH and Wikimedia Commons.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Litecoin, Dogecoin, Blackcoin and Neoscoin requested to be delisted from Coin-Swap. The move follows the recent announcement of Josh Garza\'s Paybase’s acquisition of the cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nOn January 2, the four altcoins respectively dropped off the cryptocurrency exchange and requested Coin-Swap remove Litecoin, Dogecoin, Blackcoin and Neoscoin trading. The move, explained the four respective representatives, is overall aimed at boycotting the acquisition of Coin-Swap by Paybase.\n\n""I have been pondering about this in my head for a while, ever since I learned that GAW acquired Coin-Swap, and I made the ultimate decision to make a formal request as a Litecoin Association representative to request removing Litecoin trading from Coinswap,"" wrote Litecoin Association\'s director Andrew Vegetabile, in a public announcement.\n\n""Our position and statement on the matter coincides with what others have addressed: sufficiently questionable statements, practices, and notable \'erasures\' of past claims and promises,"" stated Blackcoin representatives.\n\n@CoinSwapNet We request that you delist #Dogecoin. We feel that an association with #GAW does not serve the shibe community. (jw) @dogecoin — Dogecoin Foundation (@TheDogecoinFdn) January 3, 2015\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to four representatives from these communities: the Litecoin Association\'s director Andrew Vegetabile, the Dogecoin Foundation\'s chairman Jens Wiechers, Neoscoin\'s lead developper Kris Borodiansky, and the Blackcoin Foundation\'s Joshua Bouw, to get their input on these recent announcements.\n\nWhile sentiment towards the previous owners of Coin-Swap was fairly positive, the recent acquisition of the exchange by Paybase raised concerns, notably with regard to the obvious conflict of interest arising from owning an exchange and launching a cryptocurrency.\n\n""This could give [Paybase\'s] parent company [GAW Miners] the ability to artificially [inflate] the price [of Paycoin],"" warned Vegetabile.\n\nDogecoin Foundation\'s Jens Wiechers told CoinTelegraph:\n\n""Dogecoin, its founders as well as the Foundation, has always advocated for transparency and accountability in the running of cryptocurrency businesses and the debacle that was the moolah.io scam of ""Alex Green"" made that lesson very clear to the entire Dogecoin community. [...] The community was initially very positively disposed towards them, but the behavior relating to their mining pool (restricting pool choice for their hosted miners etc.) as well as the establishment of Paycoin was viewed with concern by many of us. ""GAW Miners has continued to become more and more [opaque] about its business processes as time went by, and their recent acquisition of an exchange creates a considerable conflict of interest that could only be addressed satisfactorily by being very transparent. Their claims are dubious, even if one is very generous and their recent censoring and deletion of references to their previously made commitments breaks the last straw so to speak.""\n\nIn response to Paybase\'s move, the four communities decided to step up and boycott Coin-Swap, for the sake of users and the overall crypto community.\n\n""This is me not sticking my head in the sand when I have the opportunity to voice my concerns and look out for my community\'s best interest and the crypto community in general,"" stated Neoscoin\'s Kris Borodiansky.\n\n""I would prefer that this entire ordeal be somewhat of a lessons learned that the multiple communities are no longer going to sit back and watch event unfold as others continue to create bad news,"" said Vegetabile, adding:\n\n""Crypto currencies are not about making money, it\'s about helping people, [helping] the unbanked, the remittances. [It is] a way to give money back to the people. [...] We here in this channel are no longer going to take this anymore and need to protect not just our communities but each others as well in order to ensure we are all safe from this. Not to say GAW is 100% a bad actor, but I have certainly been around the block to know when I can see something crashing down and, as mentioned before, giving us all a black eye.""\n\nDenials\n\nOver the past few months, GAW Miners has been a hot topic, raising fairly passionate emotions from both fans and critics. While some believe GAW Miners\' CEO Josh Garza is launching a true cryptocurrency revolution, others have suggested he has been leading an elaborate scam operation.\n\nThe criticism and skepticism were notably raised by a series of questionable statements and the behavior of the company, among which was one claim that Paybase, a payment platform for Paycoin, had partnered up with Amazon to enable payments of merchandise in the cryptocurrency on its shopping portal. Similar claims were publicly made involving other leading companies including Target and Walmart. News media Coinfire investigated the allegations, which had all been denied by the said companies.\n\nReaching out to Amazon, Target and Walmart, here are some of the answers Coinfire received:\n\n""Amazon is not affiliated or partnered with GAW Miners or paycoin,"" said an Amazon spokesperson. ""If this company believes it can imply a partnership with Amazon we will be seeing them in court if they don’t stop doing so immediately.""\n\nA spokesperson from Target stated: ""Target does not have any record of any partnership with GAW Miners or anyone named Josh Garza. Any statement contrary to this is false. We have no intention of accepting \'paycoin\'.""\n\nAnd finally, Walmart spokesperson Tara Greco, said her company has no relation with GAW Miners, Paycoin or any other project that involves Josh Garza or GAW Miners:\n\n""Walmart has no intention of expanding our current payment options to accept PayCoin from GAW Miners or any affiliate of the company. Any statements implying this is the case are false.""\n\nWhile Garza had denied all charges of wrongdoing, some of his statements and actions had raised skepticism among the crypto community regarding the legitimacy of his enterprises and the honesty of his intentions.\n\nMeanwhile, altcoin communities have raised their voices to dispute Garza\'s involvement in the crypto sphere, firmly determined to enhance the true value of cryptocurrencies as enabling people to transact in a more efficient manner, while excluding the bad players.\n\nAlong the same lines as Litecoin, Dogecoin, Neoscoin and Blackcoin, ShapeShift.io officially announced on January 3 its decision to remove Paycoin from its exchange, primarily due to a former statement made by Garza and the cryptocurrency\'s administrators on promising traders that paycoins would be bought at US$20 each on Paybase:\n\n""Anyone who studies markets should know that guaranteeing the price of anything is a fool\'s errand. But indeed, if Garza had his alleged $100m in capital he could perhaps back the value of Paycoin at $20 per and actually make good on the promise. It\'s unlikely, but possible. ""And yet here\'s what happened: not only did Garza not fulfill his promise to back the value of Paycoin at $20 per coin, but himself and his administrators seem to be actively re-writing history, scrubbing their forum of any mention of that promise. ""This moves it from fool\'s errand to the realm of deception.""\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

After an odyssey, chronicled here, here are a few things I've learned.\n\nPlayer utilities Popout\n\nShare download Listen to the Story. PRI.org\n\nQ. After the hack and ransom, what was the first thing you changed about your own computer security?\n\nI am literally backing up my computer right now — as I type! And while I routinely ignore the little pop-up box informing me that security updates are available for my Mac and Android, now I readily agree to the installation process. The computer security expert I interviewed told me that if his mom had been hacked, he would set her up with the cloud backup service Carbonite. It’s apparently mom-friendly (and will protect your files from getting overwritten with infected versions, unlike services like Dropbox).\n\nQ. If you could tell people to do just one thing to reduce the chances of getting hacked, what would it be?\n\nResist the urge to open unknown attachments! The hackers will try to scare you with a message disguised as a legitimate invoice or receipt from a well-known brand. Like they will claim to be American Airlines following up on your recent ticket purchase and provide an attached “invoice” for your perusal. Don’t click! Brand name companies will ordinarily never send you an attachment unless it is in response to a direct request from you. Hover your mouse over the link to check the URL. Pick up the phone and call the company in question directly before downloading any kind of attachment.\n\nQ. Were you under the impression that Apple products were safe from this sort of thing?\n\nI was! But it’s not true. The CryptoWall hackers have chosen not to target Macs — so far — but there is no technological barrier preventing them from doing so. And there have been other malware schemes that have successfully targeted Macs. So we Mac users can’t afford to feel safe and smug.\n\nQ. Would you advise other people to pay ransom if they were in this situation? Why or why not?\n\nUgh. Well, I certainly don’t judge anyone who decides to pay. These are people who face losing years worth of photos and important tax information, or maybe their family business is on the line. It’s a personal decision and generally an anguished one.\n\nQ. When do you think law enforcement will catch up?\n\nThe problem isn’t when they will catch up, but whether anything can be done about it if they do. The digital breadcrumb trail usually leads investigators to smaller cities and towns in the former Soviet Union. A lot of the time, perpetrators have bribed local authorities to look the other way. If there is no political will to ensure these hackers end up in jail, there is really not much US authorities can do.\n\nQ. You used bitcoins to pay the ransom. How has this changed your opinion of bitcoins?\n\nActually it has! Not so much the experience of paying the ransom, but the long chat I had with the guys who run Coin Café (which has a Bitcoin ATM.) They are such persuasive evangelists for this new cyber currency that I found myself won over. I even decided to buy some fraction of a Bitcoin (one Bitcoin actually costs hundreds of dollars) using their ATM on a lark when I was done with the interview. The only problem was the machine didn’t work — it was overstuffed with bills."", 'Bitcoin payment processing company BitPay recently terminated its association with controversial mining equipment manufacturers Alpha Technology after receiving a series of complaints from their customers.\n\nThe US-based mining company started to take pre-orders for their ASIC mining machines – Viper Miner 5MH/s and 25MH/s – in early January last year. Despite failing to meet the delivery deadlines in October, Alpha Technology continued to take money from customers by introducing other products, among which some were rumored to have their self-developed chips. To cut the long story short, no mining equipment was delivered to the rightful owners.\n\nThe representatives from Alpha Technology however claimed that they were using the pre-order revenue for “further research and developments”. It was indeed a golden time for them, as people were constantly flocking inside the cryptocurrency market to make easy and quick returns.\n\nCustomers obviously began to see red flags in their claims, resulting in a huge number of refund claims. This eventually influenced Alpha Technology’s banking and payment partners to cut ties with the company. BitPay indeed is not the first one to take such action against the mining company. Earlier, payment transfer company PayPal also withdrew its services due to a massive amount of refund requests.\n\nThroughout 2014, we have encountered many such cases where Bitcoin related hardware was either not delivered on time, or was faulty. Just last month, a Florida group faced legal charges of fraudulently selling mining equipment.\n\nDo share your opinions on such companies in the comment section below.', 'A gold exchange company that borrows some technology from Bitcoin has raised $3.5 million for a series A financing from a group of investors that include PortVesta Holdings, Soros Brothers Investments, PowerOne Capital and Sandstorm Gold.\n\nBitGold, which is based in Toronto and announced the funding late last month, uses digital payments to help acquire, store and spend gold. The company is focused on the blockchain technology, which allows for the "". . . decentralized record confirmation and global value transfer."" The co-founders of BitGold explain in a news release:\n\n“Blockchain technology has unleashed a wave of payments innovation that will empower people the world over by lowering costs and increasing access to safe and transparent financial services,” said co-founder Josh Crumb. “We see gold, the asset bitcoin was designed to mimic, as an important element in this empowerment. The flexibility of the BitGold platform allows gold to be a core savings account coupled with digital currency for seamless global payments, or as a natural-world storage and safety valve for an inevitable internet of money. The internet of money should be rooted in choice and individual empowerment, and we provide that in a flexible and secure platform.” “Since my days as a professional investor I have wondered why there’s no easy way to own and spend gold in a legal, transparent, and tax-compliant manner,” said Founder and CEO, Roy Sebag. “Technological breakthroughs in decentralized payment technologies such as the blockchain and ripple have created a historical opportunity to solve one of the main challenges preventing gold from being useful again in daily transactions. True gold ownership requires gold to be safely vaulted and stored, making it extremely difficult to spend, especially in micro-transactions. At BitGold, we solved this problem by developing a platform that is part gold exchange, part payments technology and part custodian, resulting in a powerful user experience that advances gold from a physical element to an instantly accessible unit of account and store of value for the internet, an operating system for gold.”\n\nA great example on the power of blockchain and how it can solve a common transaction problem is written up by Fred Wilson.', 'Cap tables are not just broken, they’re stuck on Excel spreadsheets and archaic paper systems. This leaves a lot of room for human entry errors and a gaping lack of information to the shareholders. But what can be done to fix the problem?\n\nSuggestions include everything from documents shared in the cloud to adding records to the blockchain. Henry Ward, founder of eShares, an online record-keeping platform for privately held companies, says the solution is to do like public companies already do – go digital.\n\nCap tables, for those unfamiliar, are a record of all the shareholders in a company. If you are a publicly traded company, the SEC requires transparency for all shareholders via the Depository Trust Corporation set up in the 1970’s. This put a stop to the physical exchange of stock certificates and provided security and accountability for the rising amounts of paperwork that were starting to crop up in the U.S. financial industry.\n\n“Admittedly, I am surprised that the current system has worked for this long. There is something paradoxical about funding companies building virtual reality, autonomous drones, and Bitcoin markets, using Excel and paper certificates.” — Henry Ward\n\nNow you buy a certain amount of Google stock and you know exactly how much of that stock you own. You can see it right away because Google is publicly traded. However, private companies such as startups and early stage ventures are not held to those same standards and still issue shares on paper. Startups often record that amount in Excel to keep track of the ownership stakes in a company. This is known as the cap table and it’s the way most shareholders figure out how much of the company they own.\n\nThe problem is humans are human, mistakes are made and certificates get lost. “Say you give me $1000 for my startup and I give you 100 shares. We issue the paper document and then that gets recorded into Excel. But then something might’ve converted wrong or the paper gets lost somehow,” says Ward, the founder of eShares, a startup attempting to bring privately held companies into the 21st Century with a digital record-keeping platform for startup shareholders.\n\nWard’s “Broken cap tables” post on Medium hit a nerve with many in the startup world over the weekend. He says he thought he would reach maybe 7 people with his January 2nd post that detailed four major issues with the current privately held company cap table system:\n\nMost cap tables are wrong Most investors don’t track their shares Note holders are often forgotten Employees suffer most\n\nThe Twittersphere caught wind of the post and it spawned dozens of conversations within the Silicon Valley community:\n\n@henrysward @semil @fredwilson we also included it in our Fri weekly reads newsletter that went out yest morn — thx! http://t.co/2tTVmmPp4P — a16z (@a16z) January 4, 2015\n\nAngel investor Andy Palmer puts it bluntly in a post on cap tables for Koa Lab, “So here you are: because some inexperienced junior paralegal screwed up certificate administration, the employee who worked hard, did your job, sacrificed as required to make the company successful and produced results, now has to reach into their pocket and pay $15K+ for a bond that should have been completely unnecessary,” Palmer writes.\n\nOn top of this, investors and employees of the company often don’t know what they own. They know the number of shares but not the percentage. The certificate doesn’t tell you this. But then they may not even get a physical paper certificate saying they own a certain amount of stock, either. That presents a particular problem if the stock splits.\n\nSome ventures try to solve for double-entry mistakes by sharing the spreadsheet in Google docs or adding the documents to Dropbox. Law and venture firms may even keep the records on their own internal electronic system, but that still doesn’t lend to full transparency to the shareholders or ensure the document is accurate.\n\nAs Union Square Ventures, an investor in eShares, noted in its latest blog entry:\n\n“At the end of each quarter, we have the fun job of nudging the busy management teams of our portfolio companies to provide a current cap table so we in turn can accurately report our ownership positions to our limited partners. The whole process feels like snail mail and is prone to error. Not to mention the process of collecting and storing stock certificates in a third party vault, even though no one except our funds could really offer these outmoded pieces of paper as evidence of a legally valid ownership position.”\n\nWard doesn’t know how wide-spread the problem is but says it came up enough anecdotally that he decided to do something about it. His startup, eShares, attempts to take the same rules applied to publicly held companies and apply that model to private ventures.\n\nThe platform launched in beta in the spring of 2013 and shortly after gathered $1.8 in seed to test the product in the VC market. It quietly raised $7 million in Series A in November, led by Union Square Ventures. Additional funding came from Spark Capital, Subtraction Capital, and angel investor Andy Palmer.\n\nWard says the seed round was for proof of product. This last round should help the company reach beyond Silicon Valley and into the main stream mom and pop entrepreneurs market. “The first thing people think about when starting a business is incorporating. I want registering with eShares to be the second thing people think about.”\n\nMatthew Joseph Martin, founder of Muslim financing outfit Blossom Finance mentioned in a follow-up Medium post to Ward’s that venture capitalist Tim Draper requires all his investments register with eShares.\n\nAlthough Ward’s post might have struck a nerve, it’s also worth noting that it’s self-serving. He might not know how widespread the broken cap table issue is, but his solution is to move equity management to a digital platform. You know, to something like eShares.\n\nIt’s surprising that startups have been working within such an archaic paper system for this long. This is Silicon Valley, arguably the most innovation-rich and technologically forward area in the world.\n\n“Admittedly, I am surprised that the current system has worked for this long,” Ward writes. “There is something paradoxical about funding companies building virtual reality, autonomous drones, and Bitcoin markets, using Excel and paper certificates.”\n\nIs it the one electronic system to rule all cap tables? Ward isn’t sure eShares is the answer, but asserts it’s at least an answer:', 'Is your company poised to build the next Uber? Have you started imagining how cryptocurrencies could be used to shore up your company’s digital security? Have you considered that the algorithms your company uses might inadvertently be lying to you?\n\nAt the end of each year, I apply a framework to surface the most important emerging trends in digital media and emerging technology for the year ahead. It analyzes consumer behavior, microeconomic trends, government policies, market forces, and emerging research within the context of our continually-evolving tech and digital media ecosystem. My colleagues and I use a core set of five attributes to look for emerging patterns: contradictions, inflections, oddities, coincidences, and inversions. Those attributes help us identify a set of likely trends on the horizon. Then, we put each trend through what we call The Five Questions:\n\nWhere/how are people wasting their time? Where/how are people having difficulty with technology? Where/how are people looking for information? Where/how are people stuck? How do people want to be perceived?\n\nThe Five Questions help us qualitatively and quantitatively assess whether or not that pattern is actually a trend that will stick in the future. We also pressure-test the ideas borne out of the trends we identify. Our 2015 trends offer great opportunity – along with some unusual new challenges – for managers in all industries. Here are six of note.\n\nDeep learning: Artificially intelligent computers are now capable of deep learning using neural networks, which you can think of as brain-inspired systems capable of translating pixels into English. Toward the end of 2014, Google researchers unveiled a new project that uses neural networks and deep learning to identify multiple elements of a scene without human assistance. Its software “learned” how to think by processing vast quantities of data. For example, deep learning will eventually allow robots to recognize objects they haven’t seen before and navigate to new locations on their own. Deep learning intersects with numerous fields, and it will soon aid in manufacturing, medicine, retail, utilities, and beyond.\n\nSmart virtual personal assistants: SVPAs started entering the market in 2013. At the time, they used semantic and natural language processing; data mined from our calendars, email, and contact lists; and the last few minutes of our behavior to anticipate the next 10 seconds of our thinking. Most of those original apps have now been acquired. Emu was acquired by Google, Donna was acquired by Yahoo, Cue was acquired by Apple…and the list goes on. When it was still active, Emu was a clever stand-in for a personal secretary. It would monitor the conversation and automatically make suggestions as two people texted. For example, if you asked your friend to see a movie, Emu would immediately geolocate both of you, suggest a nearby theater and show films and times, then check your calendars for your availability. It would even display a preview for you to watch. Once it determined the best time for you to meet, it would help you purchase tickets and enter all the data into your calendar. And it did all of this inside a single mobile application. In 2015, consumers will begin to see SVPA technology baked into their mobile phones. For example, Google is quietly starting to release a new SVPA function for Android users: it automatically detects when you’ve parked your car, marks your parking spot for you on a Google map, and helps get you back to it once you’re ready to start driving again. All without you explicitly asking it to do so. Marketers, credit card companies, banks, local government agencies, political campaigns, and many others can harness SVPAs to both deliver critical information and to better read and understand constituents.\n\n“It’s like Uber for ____”: In spite of harsh criticism about its business practices, 2014 was a banner year for Uber. With a $40 billion paper valuation, the simple app connecting drivers to passengers is now worth more than Halliburton Corporation, Aetna, General Mills, Delta Airlines, Kraft Foods, and Charles Schwab. Uber’s fast growth is due to lightning-fast consumer adoption, and that’s because Uber does two things very well. First, it monetizes downtime. For professional drivers, Uber is a fast, easy way to find riders. It’s also been a boon for people who’ve lost their jobs, offering them a way to make money when other jobs are hard to find. Second, Uber provides a seamless payment interface. Riders don’t need to carry cash or even a credit card, as the entire transaction is handled via a simple mobile interface. Uber’s success has inspired hundreds of other entrepreneurs who want to emulate the best features of the company. In 2015, expect to see lots of new, Uber-ish delivery and intermediary businesses, including fast grocery delivery, helicopter rides, portable ATMs, alcohol delivery, in-home massage service, dry cleaning and laundry, iPhone repair, personal shopping, medical marijuana, dog walkers, and on-site car mechanics. Meantime, consumers will respond to one-click transactions that process payments in the background – meaning there’s a great opportunity for established retailers, transportation companies, banks, and others to leverage what’s becoming standard consumer behavior.\n\nOversight for algorithms: In its essence, an algorithm is simply a set of rules or processes that must be followed in order to solve a problem. In the coming year, we will also begin questioning the ethics of how algorithms can be used, and we’ll scrutinize the tendency of some algorithms to go awry. Programmers are adding in subjective judgments to algorithms and allowing them to deliver answers. As a result, those in the big data space are increasingly misclassifying objects, data, and even people. There are numerous stories of algorithms wrongly identifying terrorism suspects at airports. High-frequency trading algorithms once nearly destroyed the stock market. A glitch in Amazon’s algorithm caused the price of The Making of a Fly: The Genetics of Animal Design to spike to $26,698,655.93. During the next several months, managers should discuss how to include accountability systems for algorithms.\n\nData privacy: Ongoing breaches have continued to dismantle the public trust. According to a Pew Internet and Society poll, 91% of Americans surveyed either agreed or strongly agree that consumers have lost control of their personal information and data. Whether it’s fear of a third party monitoring our mobile phone activity or concern about the safety of online transactions, people are increasingly concerned about their privacy, and they’re pointing the finger at business, not maleficent hackers. In 2015, businesses must not only work to meaningfully encrypt their data, but they must make a public showing of the measures they’re taking to safeguard our personal information. One new area of particular note in 2015: digital consent. Lawyers could soon use our personal data against us in court. Fitbit data, processed through a third-party analytics tool, was used in a courtroom late in 2014, around the same time that the FTC began investigating Fitbit’s practice of selling users’ personal data to advertisers. We will see growing demands for digital consent agreements and increased transparency.\n\nBlock chain technology: The block chain is the transaction database that’s shared by everyone participating in bitcoin’s digital system. It’s how the cryptocurrency promises complete anonymity while using a crowd-regulated public ledger system. Think of the block chain as a sort of distributed consensus system, where no one person controls all the data. Even if Bitcoin itself never really gains traction, block chain technology has enormous promise. For instance, some people argue that a block chain system would have prevented the massive credit card breach at Target. A new company, Blockstream, plans to turn the block chain into a universal platform that can be used for anything requiring signatures or authentication. It would let people participate in “trustless” transactions, where buyers and sellers work with an intermediary like an escrow manager, a trustee, or other middlemen.\n\nIn some way, each of these tech trends will affect your business in the coming year. The best way to prepare for coming disruption is to learn as much as you can, discuss implications with others in your company, and then commit to launching small experiments internally to help you see the trends in motion.', 'La discusión mundial sobre la conveniencia de Bitcoin para los mercados mundiales, ha hecho que investigadores de los bancos centrales del mundo analicen desde perspectivas económicas y tecnológicas las implicaciones de la existencia de la nueva moneda virtual.Anton Badev y Matthew Chen de la Reserva Federal presentaron un resumen de eventos asociados a Bitcoin; los cuales podrían informar al público sobre las oportunidades y debilidades de este medio de pago.

01/06/2015,"['UK-based Bitstamp, the second largest bitcoin exchange for US dollars, suspended operations on Monday, following evidence that online thieves had stolen up to 19,000 BTC—approximately $5.2 million—from its operational store of bitcoins.\n\nThe company alerted its users of the possible attack on Monday and warned against transferring any bitcoins to the service’s old bitcoin deposit addresses. Early the following morning, Bitstamp revealed that the attack affected fewer than 19,000 bitcoins. The actual attack appeared to have occurred on Sunday, January 4, when attackers compromised the company’s operational funds, also known as the “hot wallet.""\n\n“Thank you all for your patience, we are working diligently to restore service,” Nejc Kodri?, the co-founder and CEO of Bitstamp, tweeted on Monday, adding, “To restate: the bulk of our bitcoin are in cold storage, and remain completely safe.”\n\nBitstamp is the second major bitcoin exchange to claim an attack by hackers. Less than a year ago, the then-largest bitcoin exchange, Mt.Gox, suspended its service and shuttered its doors, claiming online thieves siphoned off more than 850,000 bitcoins—including 100,000 BTC of its own digital cash—worth approximately $470 million at the time. Japanese authorities now reportedly believe that 99 percent of the loss was due to fraudulent transactions, possibly by an insider, according to a report in the Japanese press last week.\n\nThe devastating Mt.Gox attack was presaged by a smaller attack. In June 2011, the site lost the equivalent of nearly $9 million in bitcoins to hackers, an amount similar to the estimated Bitstamp loss.\n\nBitstamp processed about a quarter of bitcoins transfers to and from US dollars. The conversion of bitcoins to Chinese Yuan, however, represents about three-quarters of all transactions in the last 30 days, according to BitcoinsChart.com.\n\nBitcoin users speculated on forums whether the Bitstamp incident would follow the same trajectory as Mt.Gox. For the most part, the outcome will depend on whether the company truly had only a “small fraction” of its bitcoin capital readily accessible in a hot wallet.\n\n“A hot wallet is only supposed to have a small amount of BTC, enough that they can easily cover losses,” one user stated on the BitcoinTalk forum. “If it’s only the hot wallet and they were using the hot wallet correctly—IE only having a small amount of funds in it—then everything should be OK.”\n\nOn Monday, Bitstamp stressed that its operational funds constituted a minority of its overall stores and guaranteed that users would get their digital money back. Early Tuesday morning, the company also stated that the loss was limited to at most 19,000 BTC.\n\n“This breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp’s total bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are held in secure offline cold storage systems,” the Tuesday statement on Bitstamp’s website pledged. “We would like to reassure all Bitstamp customers that their balances held prior to our temporary suspension of services will not be affected and will be honored in full.”', 'Bitcoin’s main problem is that every transaction is public. Such a feature makes it difficult to launder stolen bitcoins. Take this $5m thief as the example. The person controlling 19,000 of Bitstamp’s coins has a problem. Anyone can follow the coins as they move between addresses. Lucky for them (or not as we’ll see), there exist tools to assist in hiding, disguising, and making it difficult to prove where your bitcoins originate.\n\nMixers combine your coins with the coins of others. Everyone sends coins to a central address. The mixer sends a transaction back to each user from the key controlling the central address. When stolen coins mix with ‘clean’ coins, they become difficult to track.\n\nCoin Tumblers swap coins between users. A Tumbler will mix coins, send transactions with various amounts to keys it controls; attempting to simulate other network transactions. Sending a tumbler 1BTC may result in you receiving multiple, smaller, transactions in return over a short time. The bitcoins returned to you will have been combined, split and transacted many, many times. Taint is the probability of tracing coins back to any given address after mixing and tumbling.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nA Google search will turn up half a dozen of these coin washing services. Many are a combination of the preceding concepts. The majority offer themselves to consumers as anonymizers protecting privacy. Whether they are tools for crime or a defense against tyrants remains in the hand of the user. As Cody Wilson, co-founder of the anonymous Bitcoin wallet ‘Dark Wallet’, has said “Liberty is a dangerous thing.”\n\nAlso read: Cody Wilson: I Will Wrestle the Bitcoin Foundation to its Suicide\n\nRegardless of their deployment, these methods are not without weaknesses. Further, still, there are other ways to launder stolen bitcoins that may not require any extra services at all. Bitcoin mixes coins in transactions all the time. You’ve probably already done it dozens of times and never noticed.\n\nHow Tumblers Launder Stolen Bitcoins\n\nA Bitcoin Transaction contains inputs and outputs. Inputs reference previous payments made to you. Outputs spend the coins by transferring ownership to a new address. A tumbler can launder stolen bitcoins by mixing and distributing them to other people and back to you.\n\nAlice has previously received three payments.\n\n1 BTC she bought on Coinbase,\n\n2 BTC from her online store, and\n\n3 BTC for selling weaponized wormhole technology to North Korea.\n\nAlice controls 6 BTC with the keys in her wallet. If Alice sent all 6BTC in one transaction it’s not only reasonable, it’s likely, that someone analyzing the block chain will assume the same individual controls those keys. The transaction would join the Coinbase BTC and North Korea BTC in the same transaction with her online store proceeds as the inputs. Worse, still, if they are a government organization or Coinbase, they will be able to trace back the 1 BTC from Coinbase included in Alice’s transaction. Effectively, Alice is no longer anonymous, and her last transaction ties her to arms dealing with North Korea. Poor Alice.\n\nEven if Alice were not laundering stolen bitcoins (or her North Korean coins), sending her coins through a tumbling service as she received them, she could have a higher chance of maintaining her anonymity.\n\nThe expertly made graphic demonstrates. Multiple users send their coins to the tumbler. The coins will be mixed, then split to many addresses, mixed to small groups, mixed to large groups, sent out again, etc. Over time, Alice will receive a number of payments totaling close to her original amount (minus the tumbler fees). Then, Alice could check blockchain.info’s taint analysis for her addresses and see the chances of being connected to her pre-tumbled coins.\n\nCoin Mixing to Launder Stolen Bitcoins\n\nIf you’re planning to steal from an exchange and planning to launder stolen bitcoins through mixing here is how that works. In the section on tumbling stolen coins, Alice could potentially dox herself anytime she mixes coins she purchased from an exchange with other coins she controls.\n\nBitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell first described a new style of transaction, CoinJoin, that uses the same principle that connected Alice’s bitcoin keys. It was not developed to launder stolen bitcoins but protect privacy. The concept takes things many steps further. Transaction inputs are completely independent of each other. If a transaction contains one input from Alice and one input from Bob, they both must sign the transaction for it to be valid. Instead of a transaction containing only Alice’s inputs and outputs, a CoinJoin transaction contains inputs and outputs from many groups of people.\n\nA group using CoinJoin agrees on a transaction ahead of time. Until everyone in the group signs the transaction, it is invalid. Including multiple people in a transaction makes it much more difficult to link other keys together based on the transaction alone. If Alice includes Bob in a CoinJoin transaction, it becomes more difficult to chip away at the walls of anonymity.\n\nMore Ways to Launder Stolen Bitcoins\n\nThese two principles to launder stolen bitcoins rely on the fact that bitcoins do not exist. The balance of bitcoins anyone controls are just numbers recorded in the block chain. When combined with a transaction, it is akin to adding “2 + 2” and breaking apart the resulting “4” into “1;1;1;1” There is no way of proving “Each ‘1’ is an equal quarter of each ‘2’ added to get ‘4’” or any other denomination.\n\nThe current Alpha release of Dark Wallet supports Stealth Addresses, in addition to CoinJoin and Multisig. A Stealth Address is another privacy-related feature in the works for Bitcoin. They don’t launder funds, so much as break the usual chain of custody the block chain provides for tracking bitcoins. Also, exchanges that implement hot/cold wallets can function as tumblers and mixers if users deposit and withdrawal from the same hot wallet\n\nIt’s important to end with the weaknesses. Both of these systems relies on a foundation of “legitimate” users to effectively launder stolen bitcoins. If the hacker, who stole BitStamp’s coins, were to offload all 18,000 bitcoins on the same tumbler or mixer at the same time, their volume would overwhelm the obfuscation they hope to attain. Similarly, including 18,000 stolen bitcoins in a CoinJoin with 100 other bitcoins would just give everyone highly tainted coins. It would take some time and effort to launder so many.\n\nDisclaimer: If your goal is to launder stolen bitcoins and you rely on this article as your sole source you will fail.\n\nImages from the author and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'BitPay has made its open-source, multi-signature bitcoin wallet Copay available for free on the Windows Phone app store.\n\nThe bitcoin payment processor launched Copay on the Windows app store Tuesday at the CES consumer electronics and technology tradeshow in Las Vegas.\n\nThe news follows the December announcement that Microsoft had begun accepting bitcoin through BitPay for select apps, games and video purchases.\n\nStill in beta mode, Copay was initially developed for BitPay’s internal use, with its multisig functionality proving to be advantageous for corporate fund management and transactions requiring multiple authorizations, the company said.\n\nCopay was released as a security solution last year as demand for multisig technology increased.\n\nCoinbase, Coinkite and Xapo are among other companies in the bitcoin space that have implemented multisig technology into their services.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.\n\nWindows phone image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The US Treasury Department plans to spell out the government perspective on financial access for money services businesses (MSBs), as well as hear concerns from the MSB community, at a roundtable discussion next week.\n\nIn response to the announcement of the meeting, the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC) has created the Financial Access Task Force and applied to make a presentation highlighting the issues that digital currency businesses face when trying to establish banking relationships.\n\nThe CDC, a digital currency advocacy organisation, is preparing industry data and comment that is currently being collected through a survey on the problems digital currency or asset-related businesses have faced opening and maintaining bank accounts – whether or not they are MSBs.\n\nHighlighting banking issues\n\nForging banking relationships is crucial for businesses dealing with bitcoin and other digital currencies and assets, as well as for the growth of that ecosystem. However, many companies large and small have had difficulty doing so, or have had their bank accounts terminated for their association with digital currency.\n\nThe CDC seeks to bring greater attention to this issue at the Treasury meeting, at which industry representatives and members of the government, regulatory community, banking and credit union sectors, and MSB sector have been invited to participate.\n\n“The purpose is to collect some real solid data on what is going on with digital currency companies and to be able to show what’s actually happening in the marketplace,” said Carol Van Cleef, chair of the CDC\'s Financial Access Task Force.\n\nVan Cleef is also the co-chair of the Global Payments practice group and a member of the Financial Services and Banking practice at law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips.\n\nShe said:\n\n“We’re hoping to encourage a more wholesome dialogue about digital currencies in the banking system. We want to work to get banking organisations more comfortable with the concept of digital currencies so that they’re not regarded as being bad actors.”\n\nDenying financial access\n\nThe CDC is taking this action in part a result of FinCEN’s determination that certain types of digital currency companies are considered MSBs.\n\nVan Cleef said:\n\n“We are really at another inflection point in the MSB industry and unfortunately digital currency companies are in the wrong place and at the wrong time, and are getting sucked into what’s going on.”\n\nThe passage of the Patriot Act brought increasing pressure on banks in the early 2000s to look more closely at their customers, determine if they were money transmitters or MSBs and make decisions about whether they wanted to keep those customers.\n\nAs a result, the banking industry effectively became a de facto regulator for MSBs, loading them with more compliance requirements in just a couple of years than money transmission regulators did over decades.\n\nIt also led to many MSBs’ bank accounts being closed for any number of reasons – often that they were unlicensed or that they were unregistered – but in a lot of cases because the institutions didn\'t have the resources to carry out the due diligence being demanded from them in order to bank new customers.\n\nNow, many banks will simply refuse service to MSBs because companies classified as such aren’t included in their risk profile, Van Cleef said, adding that it isn’t uncommon for banks to treat a business as an MSB without first understanding if it falls under the status of an MSB, or how it differs from a business that does.\n\n“Money transmitters are where the regulated piece of the digital currency business seems to be lumped into,"" she explained. “They have been a very factionalized industry and they haven’t been able to put forward a strong voice or position on this issue.”\n\nAssistance with compliance\n\nThe CDC aims to bring digital currency companies up to speed regarding their obligations for compliance, federal money laundering and criminal statutes, and teach them what anti-money laundering (AML) compliance is and how to manage it correctly.\n\nThe initiative, Van Cleef said, is underscored by the recent sentencing of Charlie Shrem for aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\n“Silk Road allowed us to more carefully distinguish between illegal currency and illegal use of something that\'s very legitimate,” she said. “But that distinction often gets lost on very busy compliance officers.”\n\nAdditionally, the reports of continuing growth since the demise of Silk Road of listings for illicit goods and services that can be paid for in bitcoin, she added, doesn’t ease the nerves of bankers or regulators.\n\nBut compliance, she continued, is the name of the game. Teaching people what compliance is all about, how to think about it and how to act within its boundaries, will be key to getting businesses, banks and regulators on the same page.\n\n“There’s probably not too many banking institutions that haven’t been tested at some point or another by criminals, and they’ve learned how to cope,” she said. “And that\'s where AML compliance systems come into play.”\n\nTreasury building image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

You might say the age of cryptocurrency has arrived. Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey, who write about cryptocurrency for the Wall Street Journal\'s MoneyBeat blog, certainly think so. They co-wrote a book on the subject called, appropriately, The Age of Cryptocurrency, out on January 27 2015 from St. Martin\'s Press. I recently spoke to them about the book, currency markets, the global economic order and high-net-worth investors. The central question they are trying to answer: Is bitcoin becoming money? And if so, will it allow us to bypass banks all together, and the giant tax they levy on the global economy? They see bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ushering in a kind of radical Globalization 2.0. These new forms of money will have important implications for the world\'s wealthy. Below is an edited excerpt of our conversation.\n\nAPRIL RUDIN: What is the purpose of money?\n\nMICHAEL CASEY: This is a really a deep question because once you go beyond the functional aspects of money, you end up discovering that money is one of the key pillars of civilization. Before money emerged as an expression of status and economic power, hierarchies were determined solely by brute force and the capacity for violence.\n\nPAUL VIGNA: This is probably the one question above all others that gets into your head once you start taking bitcoin seriously, and it was one that drove a lot of what we tried to do in the book. On one level, we all know what money is, we all get it and understand it and use. But we do it without any thought to what it really represents, what it really means. When you start examining bitcoin, you start to realize those hierarchies never really went away, the means of control just changed. Money is a means of control.\n\nAPRIL RUDIN: What makes the monetary system so ripe for disruption?\n\nCASEY: The monetary system - and the payments system that comes with it - is ripe for disruption because it is structured around the biggest, most powerful and therefore most costly of intermediaries: banks. Until now, we\'ve depended on banks to resolve the fundamental challenge of being unable to trust the strangers with which we do business. Banks have resolved that problem by acting as the middlemen in that exchange. In so doing, they\'ve put themselves in the middle of our economic system - as have other financial service providers that have piggy-backed on that system - which allows them to act as the ultimate tollgate keepers to the $80 trillion global economy, drawing fees from nearly every transaction and credit transfer. All of that works like a giant tax on the global economy. If we can find a way to bypass those banks, to resolve the trust issue without having to use these fee-grabbing intermediaries, we can make the economy more efficient and create countless new opportunities for commerce. This is what bitcoin promises to achieve. This is what is exciting about it.\n\nAPRIL RUDIN: Who should read your book and what will they learn?\n\nVIGNA: Well, certainly anybody who\'s interested in bitcoin. But one thing we discovered is that the deeper we got into the story, the more we realized it isn\'t just about this technology that was created in a vacuum. It\'s a response to all the things that had gone wrong and led up to the Panic of 2008. Even if you don\'t believe in bitcoin, it\'s entire case rests on the shortcomings of the existing monetary system. Bitcoin is trying to answer the question ""Is there a better way?"" For anybody who\'s wondered that themselves, this book takes up the inquiry.\n\nAPRIL RUDIN: What do you predict will be the path to wider acceptance?\n\nCASEY: I personally think that wider adoption will come when large institutions - be they governments, banks or private corporations - start to use decentralized cryptocurrency technologies for their own procurement activities and for other purposes, such as managing their databases. It\'s not enough to say that many merchants are accepting it as an option; until a large enough group of consumers feels motivated to use bitcoin, transaction volumes won\'t be large enough to stabilize its value. And it\'s not clear that there are enough incentives for ordinary people to flock to it. So you need the push to come from big, multinational institutions for whom bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency can function as huge boost to efficiency and a way to save money. We need to see these kinds of entities adopt it as a back-office technology for bitcoin to gain the critical mass it needs to take of.\n\nAPRIL RUDIN: What kind of opportunity does bitcoin represent for the high net worth?\n\nCASEY: For high-net worth individuals, I see bitcoin as an alternative investment. It\'s the kind of investment that HNW investors and family offices would hold as say, 5% of a balanced portfolio. You might compare it to holding a portion of a portfolio in gold or in gold coins, because it could be seen as a hedge against problems with fiat currency.\n\nBut it\'s really a strategy that includes investing a risk-tolerant portion of a portfolio with an all-or-nothing possibility of very high returns. It gives these people some exposure to the prospect that cryptocurrencies one day fulfill their promise and bitcoin becomes an integral part of the global payments system. Even if bitcoin ends up playing that role in the background, functioning as the go-between currency and payments technology for transfers in traditional, fiat currencies, demand for the currency will surge, along with its value.\n\nHNW investors would also benefit from the cheaper payments option that bitcoin offers. For people who move large amounts of money around the world - say, to purchase real estate in a foreign country - the 5-10% charges that comes with a mix of bank fees and foreign exchange costs can really add up and cut into the value of such transactions. Moreover, the structure of bitcoin with its anonymity features makes it harder for governments to block or confiscate such funds as they move across borders. All of that is of benefit to high-net-worth individuals, especially when it involves moving money in and out of countries with a propensity to impose capital controls on their citizens such as China, Argentina or Russia.\n\nVIGNA: Honestly, I\'m not sure I see the case for bitcoin as an investment right now, except for speculative investors. Even if it takes off as a thing, and I do believe it or some form of digital technology will, I\'m not sure the price is going to take off. The price spike in 2013 was based on pure speculation. Now we\'re seeing bitcoin grow, and expand, and become more useful. We\'re understanding its utility.\n\nBut all of that I think undermines the speculative case. Bitcoin is useful, like a dollar is useful. You wouldn\'t pay $1,200 for a dollar. You\'d pay a dollar. I may not be explaining it well, but I\'ve a gut feeling that as bitcoin becomes more widely accepted, its price is actually going to drop. You don\'t pay speculative-fervor money for utilities.\n\n\n\nAPRIL RUDIN: How can you describe the enormity of this potential change? Does it impact everything?\n\nCASEY: Yes, it impacts everything. Cryptocurrency technology has the capacity to upend the entire global economy and create enormous efficiencies. What\'s more, taken to its logical end it will also disrupt a host of industries and lead to major job losses for people working in legacy industries whose services won\'t be needed anymore. It might even change the very structure of government and challenge the power of the nation-state.\n\nJust looking at the payments side of thing, let\'s start with the fact that the global economy is worth $80 trillion. If we shave 3% off that - which is about the average saving that cryptocurrency transactions offers on payments - that\'s $2.4 trillion, 17 times the value of the overseas development aid expenditures of all governments combined. But that\'s only beginning to scratch the surface of the potential impact.\n\nAPRIL RUDIN: What will it take for people to accept the arrival of digital currency when they are accustomed to seeing representations of money like leather wallets stuffed with dollar bills?\n\nVIGNA: I understand your question, but I think your perspective is keeping you from getting the answer. Look, I\'m actually the last person in the world you\'d expect would get interested in bitcoin. I still use cash. I hate credit cards. But I\'m also 46 years old. My formative years came when cash was still your primary option.\n\nThese kids coming up today, they don\'t use cash. They think credit cards are cumbersome. I was in a bodega recently, and the kid in front of me used his credit card to pay for a cup of coffee, and was annoyed when the cashier wanted him to sign the bill. He grudgingly scribbled something on it, left the reciept on the counter, and huffed off. My point is, the generation coming up does not have the same associations with tangible money that we do. They\'ll have no problem adapting to digital money.', 'While the bitcoin community has grown over the past year to include hundreds of new global merchants, there remains a strong market for person-to-person transactions as evidenced by existing marketplaces like LocalBitcoins and Brawker.\n\nStill, interactions on such platforms remain difficult according to Gliph. The self-described secure messaging and bitcoin payments startup has released a marketplace feature in its app with the aim of enhancing person-to-person commerce with bitcoin on smartphones.\n\nGliph CEO Rob Banagale explained that by launching Gliph Marketplace, his company is trying to insert bitcoin into the person-to-person buying and selling process, aiming to help people save money by using bitcoin instead of other payment methods.\n\nHe told CoinDesk that the goal of Gliph Marketplace is to place bitcoin in the middle of day-to-day transactions, saying:\n\n""I feel like the challenge with bitcoin is that it is so new and it is so hard to get into your daily life. It’s very hard to make it practical for a lot of people.""\n\nEnter Gliph Marketplace\n\nGliph has long been known as a messaging platform with a bitcoin layer on top. By allowing users to connect their Gliph account with a Coinbase or Blockchain wallet, the app enables users to attach bitcoin to messages on its platform.\n\nNow, with Marketplace, Gliph is adding peer-to-peer commerce functionality where users can buy and sell items. Additionally, buyers can message sellers and conduct bitcoin transactions directly in the app.\n\nBanagale argues that communication through sites like Craigslist often happens through third-party email services and requires an additional third-party platform like PayPal to send money in exchange for goods or services.\n\nGliph Marketplace, by contrast, reduces each step to one application available for iOS, Android and desktop via the web.\n\n“With Gliph Marketplace, we’ve tried to solve a lot of the problems around traditional peer-to-peer transactions that you find on Craigslist. And try to do better - way better,"" Banagale said.\n\nGetting the transactions flowing\n\nBanagale said Gliph has focused on ""the hardest, crappiest parts of doing a Craigslist deal"" to build a better experience with Marketplace.\n\nAs Craigslist users might know, the site leaves a lot to be desired in terms of usability. The site has only a few features and does not always seem an easy place to actually conduct online buying.\n\nWith Gliph Marketplace, the two payment options are bitcoin and cash. There\'s also a value-add opportunity for bitcoin users that want to save money. Sellers have the option to offer a discount of up to 40% off the listed price for buyers that want to pay in bitcoin.\n\nFurther, users have the option to make in-person cash transactions that would be confirmed on the app.\n\nBanagale hopes this feature of Marketplace will help users understand the cost effectiveness bitcoin provides as an electronic payment mechanism.\n\n""In order to solve [adoption] problems, you can’t just demonstrate how bitcoin works,"" he said.\n\nGaining traction\n\nBanagale conceded Gliph Marketplace does not have the type of mass exposure Craigslist has built. But even so, he believes the idea of supporting bitcoin will attract both buyers and sellers to the app.\n\n""We hope people use Gliph Marketplace because they want to see a product that supports bitcoin, to make bitcoin a real thing,"" he said.\n\nGliph hopes to see return use of its app not just for commerce but also communication – the original purpose of the app itself is secure messaging using AES-256, and SSL. As such, people remain contacts on Gliph after a marketplace transaction.\n\n“We allow people to become contacts with one another. They are now contacts, they are going to be able to continue to have a conversation,” said Banagale.\n\nThough it may have a tall task in trying to counter Craigslist in the long run, Gliph has support as a veteran of bitcoin startup accelerator Boost VC in 2013. The company also has backing by investors such as Pantera Capital and Tim Draper.\n\nUsers can download the latest version of Gliph with Marketplace functionality from the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store. A web-based desktop version can be also used from the company\'s official website.\n\nGliph logo via Gliph\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Just when it was announced that it was the worst performing currency in all of 2014, then now comes the news that it has slumped below the psychologically critical $300 mark. We are now talking about $270 support levels, and it would be safe to say that even the most ardent bit-believer must be skipping a heart bit (pun intended) right now, if not on the verge of an outright coronary.\n\nBut there is a ray of sunshine in the announcement today by BitMEX, a leading Bitcoin derivatives exchange that they have launched the world’s first 30 day Historical Volatility Futures Contract or BVOL.\n\nIt is a product that will allow traders to speculate on the 30-day historical volatility of Bitcoin against the US dollar as observed on Bitfinex. Traders will be able to profit on the increase or decrease of Bitcoin price volatility without taking a position in the exchange rate.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Exchanges QuadrigaCX and BitMEX Integrate with Vogogo\n\nHow It Works\n\nBitMEX has constructed a 30 day historical volatility index. The index takes the daily 1-minute Time Weighted Average Price or TWAP for Bitcoin / USD on Bitfinex between the hours of 10:00 – 12:00 GMT. Each daily value represents the realized volatility over the past 30 days. The futures contract on settlement will be equal to the index value on that day.\n\nThe futures contract expire on the last Friday of every calendar month at 12:00 GMT, and is quoted in annualized volatility percentage points. A futures price of 50.00 corresponds to an annualized volatility of 50%. For each percentage point movement, traders will either make or lose 0.01 Bitcoin.\n\nMargins and Leverages\n\nThe futures contracts will be margined the same as all other BitMEX futures contracts. In commodity trading, you are likely to hear about futures margin quite often. Futures margin is simply the amount of money you have to put up in order to control a futures contract. Futures margin rates are decided upon by the exchanges themselves, in this case BitMEX. Sometimes, the exchanges may add extra premiums on the rate so as to cover their exposure to risk.\n\nTo illustrate, let us take an example from the stock market. If you were to trade stocks on up to a 40% margin, it would mean that you could buy up to US$100,000 worth of stock for only US$40,000.\n\nBitMEX has two kinds of margins. The first type is the Initial Margin which is the percentage of the value of a contract at the order price that must be kept in equity in order to open an order. The rate is 30% to which are padded an entry commission and an exit commission. The second type is what is known as the Maintenance Margin, which is the percentage of the value of the contract at the current price that must be kept in equity so as to maintain the position. The BitMEX rate for this is 20% plus exit commission.\n\nThe initial leverage will be up to five times. Trading on leverage means that a trader would be able to buy the Bitcoin Futures contract on credit as it were. Let us take the previous example from the stock market, in which the margin requirement of the stock was 40% or US$40,000. The remaining US$60,000 would be considered as the leveraged amount. Though they have the perception of being risky, leveraged trading is often used by professional traders as it allows them to trade more contracts with less trading capital.\n\nBitMEX’s BVOL is, therefore, an indication that Bitcoin is maturing as a trading commodity something that both the SEC and the CFTC have openly or tacitly acknowledged.\n\nImages from BitMEX, jabiru and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'In the wake of falling bitcoin prices, critics are asking a familiar question, “What makes a bitcoin valuable?” There is a misconception that the Bitcoin Blockchain can be separated from bitcoin the currency, individual units representing a portion of the Bitcoin network. If a Bitcoin was worth $0, then a Bitcoin miner has no incentive to allocate their computing power to the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe incentive for allocating computing power to process Bitcoin transactions is a payout in Bitcoin, collected via transaction fees or block rewards and distributed proportionally based on computing power. The Bitcoin network currently has a limited degree of value as a near-frictionless, non-censorable value transfer network. As long as the value of a Bitcoin is larger than 0, an incentive will exist for the allocation of some degree of computing power to the Bitcoin network. That is the floor. The ceiling is nearly limitless due to the future functionality offered by the world’s first distributed immutable ledger. This future value will be realized through the creation of Bitcoin specific applications. These applications will involve value, such as gambling or a decentralized competitor to eBay, but will operate using cryptocurrencies instead of fiat currencies.\n\nOpen Bazaar is a developing project with the aim of revolutionizing peer-to-peer transactions. While an eBay transaction can cost upwards of 10% of the total value involved in the transaction, Open Bazaar plans to offer a similar functionality for a fraction of the cost through a decentralized autonomous model. The most important component of this decentralized system is the rating mechanism. As a buyer, you will logically only do business with a seller who has a perfect feedback rating. A seller will be accountable to a buyer because a negative review will hurt their future sales. A buyer with a history of leaving exclusively bad seller reviews will not be sold to.\n\nThis system is a transparent, pseudo-anonymous alternative to traditional centralized methods of doing commerce over the web. This option will gain traction through being a cheaper alternative to existing models. It will also be the first true international marketplace, as it will not physically exist in one location and will allow anyone, from any country, to sell anything they would like, assuming they are able to transport their goods to the buyer to complete the sale. When thinking solely of physical goods this can be quite limiting, though it still offers immediate benefits to those with access to international shipping. While most transactions are made for physical goods, what about digital goods like an e-book or Netflix subscription? This would allow a consumer in a country with an undeveloped banking structure to pay for a video streaming service to use on their laptop.\n\nIn the United States, online gambling has been outlawed and this ban is enforced through payment processors. Without a method of funding or receiving USD, online gambling in the United States dried up. This ban could be challenged by Bitcoin by reintroducing a funding method to the existing online gambling infrastructure. If a future gambling platform was set up in an autonomous manner, like Open Bazaar, it would be impossible to shut down.\n\nOpen Bazaar and a number of existing and developing gambling applications are immune to censorship because they do not exist in one physical location and maintain themselves automatically through minimal fees associated with use of the program. For instance, a gambling program could pay for itself to remain hosted on the Namecoin protocol (A decentralized web protocol built on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain) by charging a minimal rake fee. This fee would be collected and allocated for .bit domain maintenance, all of which would be done without human interference.\n\nI predict that we will see the development of profitable DACs (Decentralized Autonomous Companies) as distributed data storage solutions emerge, such as Storj. As smart contracts are developed by Counterparty and other Bitcoin 2.0 protocols, it will become possible to issue tokens that will contain a contractual right to a portion of a dividend automatically issued by an autonomous program. There are already multiple successful instances of crowd funding through tokenization, notably Swarm, Koinify, and Storj. The arrival of programmable money offers the capability for computers to complete immutable programmable commerce. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.', 'ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - The Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl reported it earned the highest primetime cable TV ratings on Dec. 26, exposing 3.3 million everyday people to the bitcoin brand.\n\n[Web extra: Map of Stores that accept Bitcoin]\n\nBehind that bitcoin marketing was Bitpay, a company that helps businesses accept bitcoin and aims to bring bitcoin into the mainstream. Before Bitpay raised tens of millions in investments -- with the help of people like Richard Branson -- Bitpay co-founder Tony Gallippi was sitting in a downtown Orlando bar during bitcoin meetups.\n\n""He used to head the Orlando bitcoin meetup. They\'d meet at Whiskey Dick\'s downtown,"" said Chris Connor, who built the ""first bitcoin musuem"" in Seminole County.\n\n""I got into it here, one of the very exciting times,"" Connor said, pointing to a monitor tracking bitcoin\'s value against the dollar. ""If you can imagine a 1,000 percent return in two months. It\'s hard to imagine.""\n\nConnor was one of the lucky ones who bought bitcoin before its value spiked to about $1,000 US dollars in late 2013. Lately it\'s hovering around $270. But those who bought bitcoin back in 2010 -- when one bitcoin was worth less than 10 cents -- are still way ahead.\n\n""We have a lot of people who started in bitcoin a few years ago, when bitcoin was under $5,"" said Bitpay\'s Ashley Wheeler. ""They bought a ton of bitcoin and now we call them our bitcoin millionaires.""\n\nDuring the bowl, Wheeler helped get the word out about bitcoin to a new group -- everyday people who use it to buy products, rather than investors. People don\'t have to buy an entire Bitcoin, but can instead buy any dollar amount worth of Bitcoin they choose.\n\n""It\'s like having cash,"" Wheeler said. ""So if I were to go into Ferg\'s Sports Bar and buy dinner for $50, I would pay in bitcoin and it would be like me paying cash.""\n\nBitcoin is catching on at Ferg\'s, and even major businesses like Microsoft, partly because there\'s not a three percent transaction fee for businesses like they face with a credit card.\n\n""It\'s growing by the day, we have about 40,000 merchants worldwide, and that\'s just in Bitpay,"" Wheeler said.\n\nConnor said businesses may even offer discounts to customers who pay with bitcoin, because it saves the business money.\n\nEven though the value of bitcoin has been trending down, it\'s less of a concern if you buy bitcoin the same day you spend it -- rather than if you\'re buying Bitcoin as an investment.\n\nBut bitcoin has generated negative buzz as well. It\'s earned a reputation for helping criminals hide spending. And hackers just struck Bitstamp, a major European Bitcoin exchange.\n\n""It\'s the early days, there\'s going to be some hiccups,"" Connor said, but added he believes in the future of cryptocurrency, considering the millions and millions of dollars going into its infrastructure.\n\nAlthough he admits getting mass adoption in the marketplace won\'t be easy.\n\n""You have to sponsor a football game you hope people watch, and just hope it takes off,"" he said.

01/07/2015,"['LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Bitstamp, one of the largest exchanges for the digital bitcoin currency, said on Wednesday it expected to resume trading within 24 hours after suspending operations because of a security breach on Sunday.\n\nCustomers would not lose money because of the breach and security would be increased, said Damijan Merlak, one of Bitstamp’s two Slovenian founders.\n\nBitstamp had suspended its service after the breach resulted in the loss of around 19,000 bitcoins with a value of some $5 million.\n\n“Trading will resume as soon as the new infrastructure will be in place and tested. We expect that is likely to happen within the next 24 hours,” Merlak told Reuters in an emailed message on Wednesday.\n\n“In the future we will strengthen security measures while the most important thing for clients is that they will suffer no financial damage as that will be covered by our company,” Merlak added.\n\nHe gave no further details of the problem.\n\nLast February, Bitstamp claimed that developers had come up with a solution to thwart cyber attacks against its platform after Mt. Gox, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchanges, lost an estimated $650 million worth of the virtual currency when its computer system was hacked.\n\nThe Bitstamp breach represented a small fraction of its total bitcoin reserve and the majority was held in secure offline systems, the Slovenia-based firm posted on its website on Tuesday. (bit.ly/1eTIPEt)\n\nBitstamp had said it believed one of its wallets, which store the digital credentials for a customer’s bitcoin holdings, had been compromised.\n\nIt had notified all customers after learning of the breach, requesting them not to make any deposits to previously issued bitcoin deposit addresses.\n\nBitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, started circulating in 2009. Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is generated by computers and is independent of control or backing by any government.\n\nA bitcoin is currently worth $276.80 BTC=BTSP.\n\nMerlak is one of two Slovenians who founded Bitstamp in 2011. The company has made its two founders millionaires, according to the Slovenian media.', 'Bitstamp, a European web service that allows users to buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for ""real"" currencies like dollars or yen, was just taken for $5 million. Nobody knows by exactly whom, or exactly how it was done, and that\'s a big problem for the ""future of money.""\n\nThe theft, carried out by an unknown party at an unknown location, snatched a pretty hefty sum, reports, CoinDesk:\n\nBitstamp has released a new statement regarding the security of its website, admitting that it has lost ""less than 19,000 BTC"", about $5.1m at press time. The revelation follows the disclosure that Bitstamp\'s wallet system was compromised, prompting it to halt deposits and later shut down its platform entirely.\n\nThe ""wallet"" in this case is a virtual storage system for the bitcoin funds of others, held temporarily before being bought or sold for other currencies. Someone managed to break into this virtual vault and take the bitcoins for themselves—but unlike an actual vault at an actual bank, there\'s precious little evidence to go on. Reddit\'s zealous bitcoin community is predictably pissed (""I imagine their\'s [sic] more than a few of us who saw this coming a mile away, and stayed the fuck off Bitstamp""), and the company has so far only issued vague apologies:\n\nThis breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp\'s total bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are held in secure offline cold storage systems. We would like to reassure all Bitstamp customers that their balances held prior to our temporary suspension of services will not be affected and will be honored in full. We appreciate customers\' patience during this disruption of services. We are working to transfer a secure backup of the Bitstamp site onto a new safe environment and will be bringing this online in the coming days.\n\nSecurity consultant Egor Homakov explains in a blog post:\n\nBitcoin exchangers must understand one simple thing: you\'re going to be hacked. That\'s the truth you have to accept and build your entire architecture around this axiom (think of Erlang\'s fault tolerance ""let it fail"") . And your business shouldn\'t collapse after it. [...] While blockchain is not exactly anonymous, it\'s nearly impossible to track the stolen money. You cannot get them back. Ever.\n\nThe same quasi-anonymity that makes bitcoin so alluring to paranoids and underworld types is what makes it so alluring to steal: you leave just as few fingerprints stealing it as you do spending it. Bitstamp swears it has enough money in reserves to cover any funds stolen, but the site has been down for two days now, and it could be out for days more. The company\'s promise that any losses will be reimbursed, and that the exchange is certainly not in any permanent trouble is alarming on its own, post-Mt. Gox.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock', 'Early Bitcoin adopter, libertarian and millionaire investor Roger Ver has been denied a US visa to to attend a conference, despite having been born in the country.\n\nVer made his fortune by buying Bitcoin in 2011 at a price of around $1, but renounced his US citizenship last year. Speaking to Coindesk he said that he had sought legal advice prior to the move and had been assured that he would have no trouble getting visas.\n\nIn a tweet Ver complained that the US rejected his application within weeks of him paying a $325,000 tax bill to the country. Under US law even those who renounce citizenship can be liable for tax for up to a decade.\n\nHe also included in the tweet a photograph of himself wearing a tee shirt with the slogan “borders are imaginary lines”, which he reportedly wears whenever crossing international borders.\n\nA letter from the US government informed him that: “You have not demonstrated that you have the ties that will compel you to return to your home country after your travel to the United States.”\n\nVer officially lives in Tokyo, where he moved in 2005 after serving a ten month prison sentence in the US for selling large firecrackers on eBay, which the Department of Justice described as “dealing in explosives without a license”. However, he has a second home on Saint Kitts, a small island in the West Indies, which is where he was applying for the visa from.\n\nBloomberg reported in June that Ver had started a service offering a passport from the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis - which allows international travel to many countries without the need for visas, and a low level of taxation - in return for a Bitcoin payment. The small government had offered a similar service since 1984 but residents of some countries had found it difficult to get the necessary $400,000 real estate investment out of their own countries. Ver hoped that the unregulated nature of Bitcoin would make that process easier.\n\nWhile forcing me to pay taxes @USEmbassyBbdos tyrants won\'t allow me to attend #CES2015, #TNABC or anything in the US pic.twitter.com/8dl6qpPjUM — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) January 6, 2015\n\nSpeaking to Coindesk, Ver said: “I would be fine with them denying my visa if it was for a valid reason, but they are either lying, ignorant, or stupid when they claim that I plan to secretly overstay my visa and live as an illegal immigrant in the USA.""\n\nVer bought his first Bitcoins in 2011 at a price of around $1. Since then they have risen dramatically to as high as $1,242, but have since fallen back to around $287.\n\nSince then he has been extremely active in the Bitcoin startup community, funding several companies and often handing out coins for free in order to raise awareness of the currency, earning him the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus”.', 'Blink and you\'ll miss it. Every second (or less) there\'s another bitcoin transaction—converted to U.S. currency, some are for a few dollars while others top $500,000. The audience at the Boise Public Library\'s main branch could be excused, Dec. 11 if they weren\'t fully paying attention to a presentation entitled, ""Bitcoin 101: The Digital Currency Revolution,"" as a live Internet feed from blockchain.info was beaming a rapid-fire stream of real-time bitcoin transactions on the screen behind presenters Grant Anderson and Ronnie Baird.\n\n""One of these transactions, just last week, topped $32 million,"" said Baird, glancing over his shoulder to look at that evening\'s numbers—one of which approached the $1 million mark. ""Look, there\'s a transaction that\'s close to a million.""\n\nBaird isn\'t necessarily a bitcoin expert, but he\'s as close to one as Idaho has.\n\n""Who\'s the smartest bitcoin guy in Boise? I\'m probably No. 3 and Grant is No. 1,"" Baird said, pointing to Anderson. ""Honestly, we don\'t know who might be No. 2.""\n\nBaird doesn\'t provide bitcoin services, per se, but he\'s certainly an advocate and possibly the biggest bitcoin evangelist in the region.\n\n""It\'s difficult to know how many of us are here,"" Baird told Boise Weekly. ""But I\'m out there; I\'m more of an extrovert.""\n\nWhile bitcoin may still be a mystery to many Idahoans, it\'s not uncommon to see Gem State buyers, sellers and even donors using the controversial currency. The Connections Church in Meridian accepts bitcoin in its online ""collection plate."" BYU-Idaho students can pay for off-campus housing with bitcoin and a North Idaho real estate agent\'s listing for 660 acres of prime real estate on Lake Coeur d\'Alene asked for payment in bitcoin.\n\n""I don\'t want U.S. dollars,"" realtor Alan Golub told the Coeur d\'Alene Press in March 2014. ""I want bitcoins for it.""\n\nBaird, who prefers to be called Ronnie B., is a commercial pilot by trade and many of his long-distance flights are where conversations regarding bitcoin happen.\n\n""I fly rich people, billionaires, to and from Silicon Valley all the time,"" Baird told the library gathering in December. ""And they tell me about the tens of millions of dollars that they\'re putting into bitcoin technology.""\n\nBefore Baird went much further in his presentation, he needed to bring the public up to speed on what exactly bitcoin is and address some of its controversy, including its dramatic inflation through much of the latter portion of 2014.\n\n""Think of this like the Internet in 1991,"" said Baird.\n\nBitcoin came into the world in much the same way. The currency was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 but to this day, it\'s not known whether Nakamoto was a name or a pseudonym—or even a single person at all. By 2009, bitcoin\'s protocol, transaction-tracking software and units of currency had been published by Nakamoto, and it didn\'t take long before bitcoin\'s infancy was influenced by suspicious actors. In 2011, the Silk Road drug market website launched its online clearinghouse for illegal activities and within two years, federal agents shut down the site and seized tens of thousands of bitcoins used in online exchanges for cocaine and heroin—but the shutdown of Silk Road was only one head of the hydra. So far, American authorities have closed at least 400 sites on the deep web trafficking illicit goods using bitcoins. As recently as Dec. 14, 2014, bitcoin pioneer and advocate Charles Shrem was sentenced to two years in a federal prison after admitted to aiding and abetting unlicensed money to Silk Road.\n\nAdditionally, the Idaho Department of Finance weighed in on bitcoin in April 2014 when Finance Department Director Gavin Gee cautioned investors to ""consider the risks"" of virtual currency, particularly pointing to bitcoin and how one of its largest exchanges shut down—losing more than $350 million in value—after claiming to be the victim of hackers.\n\n""Unlike traditional currency, these alternatives typically are not backed by tangible assets, are not issued by a governmental authority and are subject to little or no regulation,"" said Gee. ""The value of virtual currencies is highly volatile and the concept behind the currency is difficult to understand even for sophisticated financial experts.""\n\nWhat Exactly is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin has no central repository; rather, bitcoin is purchased via wire transfers, bank cards, credit cards and even cash, using select ATMs in some cities, at multiple exchanges across the globe. Simply put, bitcoin is not much more than a mobile app or computer program that moves funds in an out of a so-called bitcoin ""wallet."" Transactions are attached to digital signatures from the sender\'s and receiver\'s online address. Additionally, transactions can be pushed through specialized hardware by select individuals who earn bitcoin rewards for offering the service—it\'s called ""mining."" The most common transfer of bitcoin payment occurs in one of three ways: One, entering the payment amount and recipient\'s address online; two, scanning a QR code from a piece of bitcoin paper; or three, simply touching two smartphones together with NFC (near field communication) technology, similar to the recently developed Apple Pay.\n\nBitcoin prices have fluctuated wildly. A year ago bitcoin peaked at more than $1,100 per unit; but as Boise Weekly was going to press it was closer to $300, leading Bloomberg News to dub bitcoin ""The World\'s Worst Currency in 2014.""\n\n""Most of bitcoin\'s supporters, meanwhile, seem to be hackers whose resources depend upon the Ponzi-scheme nature of the enterprise itself,"" wrote Bloomberg\'s Mark Gilbert.\n\nBaird told BW that Gilbert\'s comments were malarkey.\n\n""That\'s just not accurate. Bitcoin is not the world\'s worst currency,"" Baird said, adding that explaining the phenomenon was ""very complex.""\n\n""The problem I have with talk about bitcoin is that it\'s very complicated to explain monetary policies to anybody who doesn\'t study these things,"" Baird said. ""A lot of people just don\'t understand until they get into it.""\n\nGrasping the inflation of bitcoin currency is a big part of that understanding. Baird estimated that the global market is flooded with more bitcoin every day.\n\n""You need to remember that there are 3,600 new bitcoins coming in every day. In 10 days, that\'s 36,000 bitcoins being dumped into the market,"" he said.\n\nEconomics 101 tells us that prices can\'t stabilize until demand follows such inflation. Thus significant amounts of bitcoin being dumped into the market continue to contribute to its volatility. Though there is no regulator, bitcoin users insist there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins created, but it is not uncommon for transactions to be parsed into smaller sub-units of bitcoin. For example, there are 1 million bits in 1 bitcoin, and they can be divided into even smaller units as users make bitcoin purchases for very small amounts, which is not uncommon when looking at the real-time blockchain.info marketplace. During the bitcoin presentation at the Boise Library, multiple transactions flashed across the screen indicating payments of just a few dollars; others still were less than $1.\n\nWho Needs Banks?\n\nAnderson, the co-presenter at the Boise Library discussion on bitcoin, said he spends his days as a financial analyst for St. Luke\'s-Elks Rehabilitation in Boise, but he\'s also a bitcoin evangelist.\n\n""My story begins with a friend of mine who had been working in Uganda. She needed some particular goods, and I wanted to help, but transferring money to her could have cost considerably more than the money I wanted to send. Fees are easily 10 to 20 percent to transfer funds,"" said Anderson. ""But I found a man in Kampala who traded in bitcoin. So I got the bitcoin funds to him in order to purchase the necessary goods for my friend.""\n\nBitcoin\'s acceptance by traditional financial institutions is as volatile as the virtual currency\'s value. In December 2013, the People\'s Bank of China prohibited financial institutions from handling bitcoin. In July 2014, the European Banking Authority advised its banks not to deal in virtual currencies.\n\nIn the U.S. there are few, if any, regulations on bitcoins. In fact, a growing number of businesses are now accepting bitcoin as formal payment, including Dish Network, Expedia.com, Overstock.com and even Time magazine takes bitcoins for subscriptions.\n\n""I think we purchased about half of our Christmas gifts this year, using bitcoin,"" Baird told BW. ""When we need bed sheets, a new TV, I try to find websites that take bitcoin. Plus there\'s a new intermediary website where I can create an Amazon.com wish list, put it out there and work with someone else who uses bitcoin to get the items I want from Amazon.""\n\nBaird said for now, Idaho is at the back of the bitcoin line.\n\n""We\'re as far behind as you can get,"" he said. ""A lot of people don\'t even know that a race is going on, let alone that the race is happening today. Think of this like a huge sale at an outlet mall, and the first people there are buying huge televisions for $200. Well, by the time everyone else hears about it, those TV sets will be sold out.""\n\nBaird insists that the real bitcoin boom will occur when more user-friendly technology takes hold.\n\n""Bitcoin is going to change the way we write code, the Internet, all of our interfaces; this is going to be like when the Internet exploded and the U.S. needed web developers that we just didn\'t have at the time,"" Baird said. ""This is going to be very similar to that. We\'re slow to adapt, but when it happens, wow.""\n\nMeanwhile, consumers across the globe are clearly adapting as their transactions flash across the blockchain.info tracker each day—nearly 700 more have occurred in the approximate time it took to read this story.', 'South African bitcoin exchange ICE3X has launched bitcoin trading in Nigeria for the first time, opening up a potentially huge market for bitcoin in Africa\'s most populous country.\n\nThe company has formed an exclusive partnership with Nigerian payment processor VoguePay, allowing users to buy and sell bitcoins using the local currency, the naira, directly from existing VoguePay wallets.\n\nICE3X is also planning to roll out merchant services allowing local businesses to accept bitcoin.\n\nBreaking new ground\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, ICE3X (pronounced \'ice-cubed X\') founder Gareth Grobler described Nigeria as ""virgin territory"" for bitcoin, with only a small number of traders and hobbyists involved so far.\n\n""The market, however, is potentially massive. VoguePay have spotted the opportunity bitcoin offers, seeing as one of the primary attributes of bitcoin is its security. Nigerian online consumers simply do not have the same access to goods and services from international vendors due to one simple thing – credit card fraud. Bitcoin solves that problem.""\n\nSetting up in the country was ""pretty straightforward"", Grobler added, saying it was simply a matter of expanding the business and infrastructure ICE3X already operates in South Africa.\n\nBy building a more advanced online payment system in Africa, a VoguePay spokesperson said, the company will pave the way for young African entrepreneurs to foster better business relationships, making the online markets more accessible to millions of Africans.\n\nVoguePay\'s executive and research teams are based in Canary Wharf, London, while its development, operations and professional services groups are located in Nigeria\'s largest city, Lagos.\n\nMassive youth market\n\nNigeria has over 177 million people, 33.6 million of whom are in the 18–35 age bracket, making it home to one of the largest youth populations in the world. Depending on the statistical methods used, it is also considered Africa\'s largest economy.\n\nAccording to the Nigeria Communications Commission, in June 2013, the country had 48.1 million active Internet subscriptions through mobile phone networks, yet ICE3X says this space has been largely ignored by the digital currency advocates.\n\nSetting up a bitcoin exchange may have been the easy part, though – Nigeria may have other hurdles to overcome if it is to participate in the global bitcoin economy.\n\nIt is the country that gave name to, and is synonymous with, the notorious \'419 scam\' phenomenon, which should be familiar to anyone who has ever used email.\n\nBitcoin may not be able to prevent such crimes from occurring, but it\'s important to remember 419 scams have operated just fine for decades in the fiat currency space without bitcoin\'s help.\n\nAdditional security measures enabled by bitcoin, such as multisig wallets and escrow accounts, could help overseas customers transact with legitimate Nigerian businesses with greater peace of mind.\n\nThat\'s exactly the problem bitcoin solves, Grobler said.\n\n""The idea is that, for example, a farmer in Nigeria can buy a tractor from a supplier in the USA, and both parties could benefit from the near instant, secure and transparent funding solutions underpinned by the bitcoin technology.""\n\nFuture impact\n\nIt is ""only natural"" for Nigeria to want to take part in these new opportunities, he continued, and is a market that simply cannot be ignored any longer.\n\nThis is true even if bitcoin is not quite ready for everyday use as money.\n\n""We have to be realistic though, bitcoin technology has yet to be packaged and applied correctly for it to be a mainstream alternative currency, but as an agnostic payment settlement mechanism within a larger framework it ticks all the boxes and could perhaps have a significant impact on shaping the Nigerian digital economy landscape.""\n\nBuilding a solid customer base in Nigeria aligns with ICE3X\'s longer-term product development strategy to have a robust, well tested infrastructure from which to launch its solutions.\n\nICE3X ""cannot forsee"" entering any additional African markets at this stage, Grobler said, but does plan to launch a USD market later this month.\n\nNigerian currency image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitpay, which automatically converts Bitcoin to conventional currency for retailers, lists 44,000 merchants that use its software to accept bitcoins, though it’s not clear how many accept Bitcoin in-store or have NFC point-of-sale devices. There are about 220,000 NFC-equipped stores in the U.S. (according to MasterCard) that can accept contactless payment cards and NFC-based mobile payments such as Apple Pay.\n\nWhile that number hasn’t grown in the past several years, enthusiasm for Apple’s iPhone-based mobile payments could change things. Juniper Research predicts that by 2019, 500 million people will be making transactions via NFC. That’s due in part to the October 2015 deadline that merchants face to upgrade card-reading terminals in order to avoid increasing credit- and debit-card fraud liability.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin may still be too volatile in value and have too small a user base for merchants to want to commit to it. Still, a growing number of merchants, ranging from Home Depot to Time Inc., now accept bitcoins and may welcome the tap-to-pay option.', 'Edwardo Jackson will gladly drop a Bitcoin primer on anyone who\'s curious. Beyond his outer enthusiasm for the digital currency—when he talks about Bitcoin, he speeds up as if discussing a newly-discovered oil reserve in his backyard—he loves trading it and tracking its movement in the markets. In 2013, Jackson, a 39-year-old Las Vegas-based pro poker player and former writer for Upworthy, started spreading the gospel of the currency via his blog, Blacks in Bitcoin, where he claimed that he would “spontaneously combust” if he had no other outlet to voice his obsession with the digital barter. “Can you imagine what it would have been like to own a piece of email technology in 1994?” asks Jackson, who believes the currency is still very much in its early adoption phase. “That’s what Bitcoin is like right now, and it’s only getting bigger.” While it\'s still being debated whether Bitcoin will ever gain a full foothold in the global financial ecosystem, there has been less discussion about the currency’s potential effects within communities that aren’t well served by traditional financial services. Bitcoin’s promise in the African American community has been especially overlooked—more time has been spent worrying that the currency would facilitate criminal activity.\n\nJackson doesn’t neatly fit the image many have of the typical Bitcoin user—the affluent, white, libertarian-leaning male. Jackson isn’t white, and he’s neither an Austrian School devotee nor a card-carrying member of the Seasteading Institute. (“I’m not what you would call an anarcho-capitalist,” he says. “I do believe that government can provide basic rules so that everybody can get along.”) As overall awareness of Bitcoin has grown, African Americans like Jackson might be able to serve as the currency\'s cultural ambassador to certain minority communities. From the looks of things, that’s where the currency needs a higher profile. A study conducted in May 2014 by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the Massachusetts Division of Banks showed that African Americans are less likely than whites and Hispanics to have heard about virtual currencies in general. Another study, released in July 2014 by the digital media company Morning Consult, found that African Americans are less likely than white and Hispanics to know “a lot” about Bitcoin. Bitcoin traders might interpret those findings to mean that there isn’t a market for the currency in the black community. Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist of the brokerage firm ConvergEx Group, doesn’t believe that’s the case. Having written online commentaries and appeared on cable financial-news outlets, Colas is one of Bitcoin\'s earliest and most vocal evangelists. He believes the currency would be useful to a variety of demographics. “Bitcoin is a Rorschach test for anybody interested in banking, because different people see different things in what Bitcoin can offer different communities,” he says.\n\nWith the African American community, Colas sees the currency filling a significant financial-services void. As support, he cites a Senate committee letter written in 2013 by then-Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, along with a Bitcoin primer published by the Chicago Fed. Neither offered any official endorsement of the currency, but both missives noted the possible benefits of facilitating low-cost transactions in communities where currency exchanges, pre-paid cards and payday loan services are prevalent. “That’s where the promise is for the African American community, because in a finished form, it allows for a cheaper money-transfer system than anything that the current financial system can provide,” Colas says. “The fact that many African Americans don’t use PayPal…demonstrates this lack of trust in financial institutions."" According to Shawn Wilkinson, the founder of Storj, a cloud-storage service, Bitcoin could enable people to engage in online microloans. “Bitcoin, or some kind of cryptocurrency, has the ability to decouple African Americans from the economic system in a positive manner,” he says. “With Bitcoin, there are a lot more methods with microlending, where you can have communities using cryptocurrencies to help themselves without any intermediaries.""\n\n\n\nWilkinson, who became fascinated by Bitcoin in 2012 while studying computer science at Morehouse College, is more interested in the currency as a way of teaching people about how technology works. Beyond microlending, he sees the real value of Bitcoin for African Americans coming from mining the currency—the process of using software programs to solve complex algorithms verifying Bitcoin transactions, which grants Bitcoin to individuals for their efforts. Mining, Wilkinson believes, will influence more African Americans to become knowledgeable about back-end technology. “In terms of the Bitcoin ecosystem among African Americans, it really doesn’t offer any benefit over any other demographic,” he notes. That said, he does think it could be quite useful for Africans and Afro-Caribbean natives living in America who want to send money, at a lower cost, to relatives in other countries.\n\nNicholas Pearce, an assistant professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, does perceive some value in African Americans adoption of Bitcoin, particularly among those who rely significantly on pre-paid cards and currency exchanges to manage their money.\n\n\n\n“Bitcoin can be a very useful tool to engage historically under-engaged populations into more digital transacting,” Pearce says. “One thing that is true of any type of innovation of this sort is that there are going to be some people who are early adopters, and Bitcoin is an answer to a problem they have had for years.” ""Just like with poker, Bitcoin right now is a very egalitarian game."" Nonetheless, Pearce stops short of a full-on embrace of the currency, and he\'s not convinced that anyone besides early adopters will start using it in the black community. “For African Americans in particular, I think the issue with Bitcoin is that it stimulates arms-length transactions,” he says. “In the African American community, by and large, people tend to be more relationship-oriented than transactionally-driven."" Pearce believes there\'s a distrust in the black community of the financial landscape at large—a distrust that might go back as far as the bank runs from the Depression era. “The fact that many African Americans don’t use PayPal,"" he says, ""or are even afraid to do retail banking, demonstrates this lack of trust in financial institutions, even when there is a face on the other side. Many times, you’ll hear them say, ‘I don’t trust banks, I’d rather put my money under a mattress and risk it being stolen than put it in a bank for some unnamed institution to steal it.’”\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin\'s volatility might raise red flags in the black community. African Americans are, to be sure, a powerful consumer force—a Nielsen study last year projected that the buying power of the demographic would reach $1.3 trillion by 2017. But black wealth continues to lag considerably behind that of whites, and according to a study released last year by the Center for Global Policy Solutions and Duke University, black households own only five cents of wealth for every dollar owned by whites. That level of economic disparity means that African Americans accumulate less less in savings and stock holdings compared to other groups—which doesn’t make the strongest case for owning an asset as volatile as Bitcoin. And this is to say nothing of the security worries surrounding the currency, which were proved at least somewhat valid after Mt. Gox, the leading Bitcoin exchange, was hacked in 2013, costing investors hundreds of millions of dollars. For most African American investors, these effects can be disproportionately devastating. Even a financial analyst as bullish on Bitcoin as Colas acknowledges these concerns should not be taken lightly. “Typically, lower-income households should primarily focus on trying, as best they can, to build up a small savings buffer,” he says. “That isn’t necessarily well-served by having it in Bitcoin because of the volatility of the currency.”\n\nColas does believe those concerns will be assuaged over time, as mining activity picks up and more Bitcoin is released into the virtual monetary supply—Bitcoin mining isn’t estimated to end until 2140—potentially bringing more stability to the currency’s price and drawing in more users. This could also lead more businesses to accept Bitcoin as well. With these developments, perhaps Bitcoin could exist alongside the historically “relationship-oriented” transactions that Pearce describes. Still, if those issues get ironed out, there is still the question of whether Bitcoin is conducive to criminal activity. It’s not an issue that applies only to African Americans; the biggest investigation of illegality funded by Bitcoin is currently underway in Australia. ""Bitcoin is not going to be the cause of illegal activity. People are the issue."" But in economically-distressed black communities especially vulnerable to the ravages of drugs and violence, the prevalence of Bitcoin could be particularly unnerving. In addition to his academic post, Pearce is an assistant pastor of the Apostolic Church of God in the Woodlawn neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side. For years, parts of Woodlawn have witnessed rampant drug use, violence and gang activity (the well-known Blackstone Rangers gang was established there). As a notable figure in the neighborhood, Pearce can empathize with residents looking at Bitcoin with a wary eye.\n\n""There\'s no question that Bitcoin has the capacity to accelerate other activities in the community that are destructive, because of its arms-length nature,"" he says. ""I think for many people in the black community who have heard of Bitcoin and have associated it with the an illicit marketplace, they will keep away from it so as not to introduce it into a community that has enough issues with alternative economies."" Ultimately, Pearce doesn\'t foresee Bitcoin exacerbating black communities\' socioeconomic ills any more than he foresees it promoting African-American financial empowerment. ""Bitcoin is not going to be the cause of illegal activity,"" he says. ""People are the issue.""\n\n\n\nColas, for his part, thinks the concern of criminal activity can be dealt with as the currency moves into the regulatory sphere of the financial system, both at the state and federal level. The New York State Department of Finance, for example, has been one the more prominent regulatory bodies, attempting in the past year to establish regulations. “As Bitcoin gets cleaned up, as regulators put rules around it, that will get resolved,” Colas says. Given that there are demonstrable upsides to using Bitcoin, how might more African Americans come around to using the currency in their everyday lives? Kinnis Gosha, an assistant computer-science professor at Morehouse College, says that African American merchants could play a large role, since they are ever-mindful of transaction costs. ""If you\'re a small business owner, and you say, \'We\'re not doing PayPal, we\'re only doing Bitcoin,\' and it is actually in places where African Americans shop, it\'s going to be hard to get African Americans to refuse it.”', 'Precious metals dealer Amagi Metals announced it is now paying its entire staff in bitcoin via payroll service provider Bitwage.\n\nThe move forms part of the company\'s plan to \'divorce\' the US dollar by 2017, where it will stop accepting the fiat currency as payment method.\n\nAmagi Metals has worked with bitcoin for two years and, according to company data, 30-40% of its costumers currently pay with the digital currency.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, CEO Stephen Macaskill said he wanted to find a company that could handle bitcoin payroll seamlessly and test it with his own paycheck. Later, he put the proposition to others at Amagi:\n\n""I made a comment about it at a staff meeting and was surprised, and excited, to find out that everyone was really eager to go full steam ahead with this. So we made this as a voluntary option, and everyone jumped on board immediately!""\n\nEvery employee at Amagi Metals has set a percentage of their paycheck, both big and small, that they wish to be paid in bitcoin. To demonstrate his support, Macaskill will personally be paid roughly $40,000 of his salary in bitcoin this year.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by operating a business with bitcoin, Macaskill expects a higher degree of stability in the long run. He said:\n\n""Bitcoin volatility may have concerned me a year ago, but now there are so many different options to hedge bitcoin against fluctuations, that I\'m not too concerned. I also think that if you\'re in it for the long run, it is inevitable that volatility will continue to drop as adoption grows.""\n\nA popular paycheck\n\nMany other bitcoin-friendly companies have already adapted to a bitcoin payroll. At wallet provider Blockchain for instance, all workers are paid in the digital currency. A survey from Bitwage last year revealed that 47% of bitcoin companies are open to paying their employees in the digital currency.\n\nOne of Amagi\'s competitors, Bullion Bitcoin, has been paying all of its employees\' salaries in bitcoin since the company was set up in 2013. Founder Adam Cleary told CoinDesk he welcomes Amagi Metal and other businesses to the community:\n\n“It helps to contribute to build the bitcoin ecosystem if people are willing to treat bitcoin as a currency in its own right and to accept it as a mean of payment.""\n\nBullion Bitcoin is an online exchange for physical gold bullion and bitcoin, and it deals with no fiat currencies. Cleary said that no employee has yet asked to have their salary paid in fiat money, and ended:\n\n""Our staff think it\'s cool.

The name change coincided with a shift in the company’s services, from operating a small fleet of bitcoin ATMs in the greater Boston area to adding an in-person bitcoin buying network supported by 2,500 US merchants.\n\nCo-founder Chris Yim explained that the capital will be used to grow the LibertyX team, which today consists of just three employees, while expanding its presence in the US.\n\nYim told CoinDesk:\n\n""We\'ve bootstrapped everything to-date and I am proud of what we\'ve accomplished with just the three of us. This round will allow us to add staff to help address the growth we are experiencing across the board.""\n\nLibertyX has already put the funding to use since it was completed on 22nd December, hiring a dedicated CTO to the team. Yim said additional staff will be added in 2015.\n\nThe company is formally registered under the name Moon, and an SEC filing for the deal reveals the total funding received was $404,104.\n\nWith the move, LibertyX joins additional Project 11 portfolio companies including online catering company Phoodeez, location analytics company Locately and electronic tipping startup DigJar.\n\nCapturing market interest\n\nOperational for roughly one year, LibertyX has also arguably benefited from its early and timely entrance into the bitcoin market.\n\nAs Liberty Teller, for example, the group launched what is considered to be the second bitcoin ATM ever installed in the US in Boston’s South Station last February. A Lamassu model that debuted in a cigar bar in New Mexico, and was later removed, is believed to be the first.\n\nControversy aside, the group has remained relevant, strategically placing machines in high-profile locations near the tech-friendly campus of MIT at a time when bitcoin activity on the campus has been of international interest.\n\nThe company has also struck key partnerships both as a graduate of the MassChallenge startup accelerator and a partner of transaction processing specialist Qpay, which enables it to reach an extensive network of retail partners in its home market.\n\nOpportunity for ATM operators\n\nAs LibertyX has quickly expanded beyond owning and operating four bitcoin ATMs, Yim expects that the move is a sign that other ATM owners may begin to announce more ambitious plans.\n\n“Most operators today manage few machines where external funding is not necessary. But, I believe it\'s only a matter of time,” Yim said, alluding to new funding rounds that could occur in 2015.\n\nThough he sees much opportunity in the space, Yim also suggested that this window of opportunity could be limited, as he predicted increased VC interest would coincide with a consolidation of market participants.\n\nFirst introduced in late 2013, the bitcoin ATM sector experienced an impressive year of growth in 2014, expanding from just a few units to hundreds around the globe.\n\nMore data regarding bitcoin ATMs can be found in CoinDesk\'s ""State of Bitcoin 2015"" report.\n\nHiring image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

And in November, the organizers held a successful six month anniversary event entitled “Arnhem Bitcoin Metropolis,” which attracted nearly 100 people who made over 175 Bitcoin transactions.\n\nFirst Stop: Bitcoin City\n\nWhile on vacation in the Netherlands during the holiday break, I decided to bring my bitcoin-filled digital wallet and pay a visit to Arnhem Bitcoinstad, a city with a population of just over 150,000 people, to get an idea of what is actually happening on the ground. My goal was also to rely as little on fiat currency as possible.\n\nI had to pay for the 30-euro roundtrip train ticket from Amsterdam in euros, but the good news was that I withdrew the fiat from a two-way Mr. Bitcoin BTM in Amsterdam. So far so good.\n\nAfter an hour-long trip by train, I finally arrived in Arnhem, Bitcoin City and arranged to meet one of the organizers of Bitcoinstad, Patrick Van Der Meijde of Bitkassa, a Dutch payment processor.\n\nNaturally, the meeting place was the local Spar supermarket, the first Dutch supermarket to accept Bitcoin, conveniently located right next to the train station.\n\nThe Spar supermarket proudly displayed their “Wij accepteren bitcoin” sticker on their front doors, along with a multitude of other payment methods. “Of course you can pay with bitcoins,” said the cashier. So after buying an orange juice and a coffee with bitcoins for the first time in a supermarket, to my excitement, I sat down and waited for Patrick to arrive.\n\n“I believe you just made a payment over here at Spar,” remarked Patrick upon arrival. “Well, it’s in the statistics and the minute you pay for something, it shows up on our website.” (You can check out the stats on the Bitkassa website here). As far as growth is concerned, he added:\n\n“It is still small, but we do see a rise in sales.”\n\nPatrick went on to explain why he is so passionate about Bitcoin, calling it “an alternative to the current financial system and the banks that caused the financial crisis.” He also expects another crisis “within a few years” because “the system has not changed and an alternative will be needed.”\n\nEstablishing and fostering a Bitcoin ecosystem in his home city could, in fact, give the local economy the necessary tools to weather yet another crisis that is almost guaranteed by the boom-and-bust cycles inherent in the traditional financial system.\n\nThe Challenges of Mainstreaming Bitcoin\n\nOur discussion shifted to the challenges Bitcoin is facing in getting more people onboard. “It’s too technical for most people,” explained Patrick. “It takes them a while to understand how it works and it’s so different than the things they are used to.”\n\nIndeed, I have noticed this when traveling around the Netherlands. The usual reactions from people when I pull out my phone to scan a QR code vary from looking at me as if I’m from another planet, to showing interest and inquiring about Silk Road, Mt. Gox and other juicy headlines they might have encountered in the past year.\n\n“They’re used to something tangible and a government or bank that they can rely on,” he added. When explaining Bitcoin to regular people he told me that he usually tries to make “a connection with email … explaining how there is no director of email or director of the internet.”\n\nThe Origins of ‘Bitcoin City’\n\nThe challenge of getting more people to use Bitcoin is exactly the reason why the Bitcoin City project was launched. “The first couple of merchants were the hardest to get on board,” said Patrick. He further explained:\n\n“We started it because we live in Arnhem. We thought it was cool if we could pay our expenses ... in bitcoin. And of course it would be nice if other people join us and use bitcoin as well.”\n\nThus, the typical “chicken or the egg” issue facing Bitcoin was the driving force behind the project. Merchants don’t see the need to accept it if customers do not use it, and customers do not use it, since no merchants accept it. Bitcoin City is attempting to tackle this problem head on by not only onboarding local businesses, but by also giving out paper wallets with a small BTC balance to familiarize people with the technology. They are closely working and exchanging feedback with merchants and customers, and maintaining a constant communication line with local businesses.\n\n“Now if you could just use bitcoins to pay for your utility bills and at a gas station, then you would pretty much have all of your expenses covered,” I said jokingly. Patrick agreed, confirming that’s precisely the goal right now, while also mentioning that he is currently in talks with a local dentist who has shown interest in accepting bitcoins for his services.\n\nIn addition, Patrick also described the project’s beginning from a legal standpoint:\n\n“When we started Bitkassa, we got a call from the local tax services and they asked if they could have an appointment. We talked about our plans and we actually educated them about Bitcoin, since it was new to them as well. I found out a lot about Bitcoin and taxes in Holland. Someone at the tax services was also writing a paper about [Bitcoin] and I emailed them the paper of their own colleague and the conclusion was that Bitcoin should be free of VAT.”\n\nAt least for now, the Netherlands are leaving cryptocurrencies alone, although its definition as a currency or commodity still occupies a grey area, depending on whom you ask. Patrick cited a general statement by The Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM), which says that “according to the law, Bitcoin is not a currency, so it’s not our business.”\n\nInside Bitcoin City\n\nI used the Bitcoin City map that Patrick gave to me and I went from business to business. One of the most promising aspects that I witnessed was how much of a grassroots movement this project actually is. Patrick seemed to know every single Bitcoin merchant in the city, whose numbers have grown to over 45 in seven months, on a first-name basis.\n\nThe merchants who are already accepting Bitcoin are increasingly recommending other businesses who would possibly be open to using the cryptocurrency. “That’s how I got more merchants,” he explained. “The first ones were the hardest.”\n\nCafe Njoy was the first business to accept Bitcoin in the city, and neighbors of the cafe actually recommended it when they were hesitant to accept it themselves. Over time, it has become easier to sign up more businesses. Positive press coverage allows Patrick to reference such articles when talking to local merchants who might otherwise be ambivalent or reluctant to accept a currency that mass media often stigmatizes and associates with illegal activities.\n\nSlijterij van Pernis was another business among the first to sign up. Patrick told me that the owner explained why he chose to accept Bitcoin:\n\n“I can tell you more about beer than about Bitcoin, but I got more customers as a result and it doesn’t cost me anything, so it’s ok with me.”\n\nUnfortunately, I did not have the time to visit every bitcoin business, but one of my first stops was a sandwich shop, popular among students, called Mo Lón Sandwiches. “Their POS tablet was stolen,” said Patrick, “so now they just flash the QR code on the big screen near the counter.”\n\nThis wasn’t a problem. I simply scanned the code on the screen and paid for our meal (which tasted amazing by the way) in a matter of seconds.\n\nFrank, the owner, later told me that he sees about three customers per week paying with bitcoins, and admitted that it has not been growing as fast as he had hoped. However, offering an additional payment option for his customers at no additional (and even lower cost compared to credit cards) to him was a no-brainer.\n\nFor the sake of brevity, I will not delve into every other transaction I made in Arnhem, as I had no problem paying with bitcoin at any of the locations on the map. Some of the other spots I visited included:\n\nEvery reaction in Arnhem I received from owners when opting to pay in bitcoin was very positive. Every time I asked about the paying with BTC, the reply was always:\n\n“Oh, so you want to pay with the bitcoin, great!”\n\nHowever, a few times, I did encounter some staff members who were not yet familiar with how to use the POS tablet (although this problem was more common in Amsterdam, which I will cover later). Nevertheless, this wasn’t a major hurdle, as I demonstrated how simple it was to use their Bitkassa terminals to enter the amount in euros and bring up the QR code on the screen.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nOne of the most exciting takeaways from my experience was the fact that some Bitcoin-accepting merchants are “in talks” about conducting business between each other using bitcoins. For example, a cafe could buy their organic coffee from a local eco-supermarket and remove fiat currencies from the equation altogether.\n\nA major boost to Bitcoin adoption could come as a result of local businesses not only simply accepting bitcoins, but also conducting their B2B transactions in cryptocurrency. On the supplier side, if local coffee producers in Ethiopia, for example, also use bitcoins, then middle-man fees could be significantly reduced across the entire supply chain, reducing costs for producers to consumers.\n\nIf you’re looking to get the most out of your bitcoins offline, then Arnhem Bitcoin City is probably your best shot right now. There is also a hotel accepting bitcoins, as well as a massage therapist, a postal service, a hair salon, and even a tire repair shop.\n\nWith the Bitcoin City project setting its sights on museums, cinemas, expositions and libraries, all of your needs will soon be covered and payable with bitcoins. Perhaps the boost to the fledgling ecosystem might come not from bitcoin enthusiasts, but from the sputtering global financial system itself.\n\nSince almost everyone agrees that it’s not a question of if but when—when the next financial crisis hits—Arnhem, will already have the infrastructure in place to wean itself from the traditional banking system and ride out the storm better than other municipalities.\n\nFull disclosure: I paid 50 cents in fiat, twice, to use the restroom in Arnhem Central station.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Buy from Amazon.com\n\nUpgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors’ Picks newsletters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBITCOIN may well be the world’s worst-performing currency. In 2014 it lost more than half of its value against the dollar, beating even Ukraine’s hryvnia and the Russian rouble. But measured by the number of new books it has inspired, bitcoin is top of the pile. Nearly 200 titles about the crypto-currency came out last year, according to Amazon. Another dozen will hit the shelves in the coming months.\n\nBe warned, though, some are pretty bad. Brian Kelly, an investment manager and talking head on CNBC, takes several stabs in “The Bitcoin Big Bang” at explaining how the crypto-currency works, only to confuse the reader with his odd metaphors: “Let’s call the first bitcoin a socialite named Genesis.” Dominic Frisby is a comedian and a financial writer who in an earlier book outed himself as an anarcho-capitalist. In “Bitcoin: The Future of Money?” he suggests that bitcoin will change the world as we know it because governments will be unable to raise money for long wars if the currency is widely adopted. “It is a force for peace,” Mr Frisby insists.\n\nFor any book on bitcoin to be worth reading, though, it has to delve further: into the crypto-currency’s ideological and technical roots, for instance, or what it adds to the narrative of money, or even what its economic and political impact may be. The currency’s dollar price may be three-quarters down on its peak, but the underlying technology also provides plenty of intellectual fodder—and is unlikely to go away. So there is plenty to write about if you are serious.\n\nPaul Vigna and Michael Casey, two journalists at the Wall Street Journal, are certainly serious. In their new book, “The Age of Cryptocurrency”, they don’t waste time projecting millenarian political beliefs or searching for bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, though they argue that the crypto-currency’s quasi-religious “creation myth” has been an important factor in creating a community around the project. Before he went offline in 2011 without leaving much of a trail, Mr Nakamoto had cleverly combined ideas developed by others with his main invention: the “blockchain”, a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions. The blockchain lives on the system’s global network and is maintained and protected by “miners”, operators of specialised computers who are rewarded with bitcoin for their efforts.\n\nRather than begin their book with a breathless account of how bitcoin could change everything, Messrs Vigna and Casey start with a brief account of the centuries-old debate about the nature of money. The “metallist” school sees money as a commodity, a thing with its own inherent value—which governments should leave alone as much as possible. By contrast, “chartalists” view money as a complex system of credit relationships, which allows value to flow within a society. For these people currency is just the token around which the monetary system is arranged. And governments have a role to play in managing this system and thus the economy.\n\nThis philosophical division is also present in the debate about bitcoin. Libertarians treat it as a scarce commodity that needs to be “mined” (to create bitcoin and maintain the blockchain, miners solve mathematical puzzles, meaning that bitcoin is willed into existence by burning energy—see article). But for a growing number of geeks and venture capitalists bitcoin is less a currency than a technology that can be used to transfer money and other assets cheaply and securely.\n\nMessrs Vigna and Casey predict that bitcoin’s main calling will indeed be as a disruptive payment system. Before the crypto-currency, societies had to rely on banks and other centralised institutions to keep track of payments and guarantee the financial system. This position as gatekeeper has allowed these institutions to capture much economic rent. The blockchain technology cuts away the middlemen by taking over the role of ledger-keeping. “At its core, crypto-currency is not about the ups and downs of the digital currency market,” the authors write, but “about freeing people from the tyranny of centralised trust.”\n\nThe book is at its liveliest when it discusses the potential impact of bitcoin. The currency may not be a must-use in rich countries with well-developed payment services, but it could help the poor world’s 2.5 billion unbanked to connect to the formal financial system (the book opens with the story of an Afghan woman who gets paid in bitcoin for the articles she writes for an American website). What is more, because no one controls the blockchain it has already become the foundation (“platform” in the parlance) for a growing number of start-ups. And the technology may also undermine other centralised institutions in the “trust business”, such as stockmarkets, or give the sharing economy a boost (some have speculated that in future taxis may be not only self-driving, but self-owned—meaning they are effectively owned by the blockchain).\n\nWisely Messrs Vigna and Casey do not predict that this will happen overnight, or that the technology is a panacea. Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies will continue to grow, they write, not alongside the offline world, but attached to it, with institutions and businesses adopting it to suit their needs. Bitcoin may well trigger a revolution, but it will be a slow one.', 'As customers ate lunch at a popular restaurant in Washington’s Adams Morgan neighborhood, few had any inkling they were on the front lines of an international monetary war that’s featured FBI raids, the Deep Web, allegations of money laundering and millions vanishing in a nanosecond.\n\nNot to mention predictions of the demise of cash.\n\nThe Diner, as the Adams Morgan eatery is aptly named, recently installed Washington’s first ATM for bitcoin, a controversial digital currency with fierce advocates and ferocious critics.\n\nBitcoin fans, who tend to have a libertarian bent, say it’s a revolutionary way to move money quickly and anonymously from one point to another – whether around the corner or across international borders – with no middlemen, no fees, no central banks, little regulation, no collection of personal data and almost impenetrable computer security.\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Ron Paul, who first ran for president in 1988 as a Libertarian Party candidate, said the bitcoin was a welcome newcomer in “the terrible monetary system” that held sway in the United States.\n\n“We have a government that purposely counterfeits and debases the currencies, and I believe that the alternative would be a competition,” Paul told the Quora online-interview website last spring. “Anything that wants to substitute for the American dollar should be permitted. There should be no prohibitions; there should not be a monopoly and a cartel running our monetary system because it so often benefits the privileged few. . . . Bitcoin is an introduction to that.”\n\nBecause bitcoin is an encrypted “ cryptocurrency,” with each transaction tied to a unique 32-digit code of randomly generated numbers and letters, it can’t be stolen from a gas pump the way thieves use a simple device to lift credit card account numbers.\n\nSix “core developers” – some of the world’s best software engineers – oversee the bitcoin’s international network, tied to 100,000 computers.\n\nHelped by hundreds of anonymous “miners,” they maintain a public “ blockchain,” a digital ledger that records every bitcoin transaction with a 32-digit code. Each public code, in turn, is linked to a 32-digit private code known only to the bitcoin owner. The miners use mathematical equations and algorithms that bounce around the globe instantaneously to verify the authenticity of each transaction.\n\n“Before I got into bitcoin in July 2010, I thought it was impossible,” Jeff Garzik, an Atlanta-based software engineer who’s one of the core developers, told McClatchy. “They proved me wrong.”\n\nMysterious beginnings\n\nTrue to its enigmatic status, the bitcoin’s origins are shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn 2008, someone using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto posted a white paper outlining the bitcoin in concept to an e-group of computer geeks. The following year, the anonymous genius uploaded open-source software to the Internet to implement it.\n\nGarzik and the other core developers emailed with Nakamoto for two years as they expanded the digital currency Nakamoto had invented and learned how to run it. Despite their skill at tracking all things digital, however, they never learned Nakamoto’s real name, gender, nationality or location. Then, circa 2011, Nakamoto went silent. No one has heard from him or her since.\n\n“Basically, he signed off a few years ago,” Garzik said.\n\nUsing the kind of understatement brilliant software engineers are prone to employ, Garzik added: “He was above average at protecting his anonymity. He didn’t leave any data points.”\n\nBy now, bitcoin has attracted an intense, if limited, following.\n\n“I’ll tell you why the bitcoin is one of the best things ever invented,” Andy Mahoney, an ATM scout who finds merchants willing to accept the machines, told McClatchy. “For the first time, a person can send another person money anywhere on the planet instantaneously with virtually no costs. It’s completely safe and secure and encrypted, which means you’re sending your money anonymously.”\n\nDetractors counter that these purported strengths of the bitcoin, which is currently trading for about $298 apiece – it varies slightly on different exchanges – are really weaknesses.\n\n“The underlying technology has great potential, but I’m skeptical of the raw, unregulated, anonymous form of bitcoin,” said Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve examiner who teaches finance at Boston University. “It avoids the controls that have been created by our banking system, and it’s void of consumer protections. If your ‘bitcoin wallet’ gets picked digitally, there’s no way to trace it back to the culprit. You’ve lost everything.”\n\nWilliams has earned the ire of bitcoin enthusiasts, who’ve taken to superimposing pictures of Dr. Evil on his Internet photos. He delivered critical testimony to Congress last year and made a skeptical presentation to the World Bank. He also went toe-to-toe with Netscape founder Marc Andreessen, a big bitcoin investor, in dueling opinion columns.\n\n“I call these bitcoin ATMs ‘automatic betting machines,’ ” Williams quipped to McClatchy. “It’s the only machine where you can put in real money and get out fake money.”\n\nHard-to-trace transactions\n\nMost people who use a BTM – insider lingo for a bitcoin ATM – have an app-like “bitcoin wallet” downloaded to their smartphones, which has an embedded bar code that they hold up to the BTM screen during an exchange.\n\nBitcoins, or digital fractions of them, flow into or out of the virtual wallet depending on whether they’re being bought or sold. Ninety percent of the transactions at the 310 or so BTMs worldwide, with about 60 in the United States, involve people exchanging dollars for bitcoins.\n\nThere’s thought to be about $4 billion worth of bitcoin in circulation, but only a portion of that is being used – partly because speculators are hoarding it, partly because few merchants accept it.\n\nMost bitcoin transactions don’t involve BTMs or purchases, but are instead direct person-to-person transfers. Want to send your college daughter some money? Open your phone’s bitcoin wallet, enter the amount and punch in her wallet’s unique code. She’ll have the money moments after you hit the SEND icon.\n\nWilliams and other critics, however, think the bitcoin is tailor-made for Internet pornography, gambling, money laundering and other illicit activities because it’s hard to trace and operates outside long-standing fiscal institutions.\n\nIn one bust, on Oct. 21, 2013, FBI agents raided the San Francisco offices of the Silk Road, a bitcoin-based online black market. They shut down its operations and arrested its proprietor, Ross William Ulbricht.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts, Ulbricht is accused of selling illegal drugs via a hidden Internet service called Tor on what’s called the Deep Web, or Deepnet, because it’s configured to elude standard search engines. His trial begins Jan. 13.\n\nFor BU’s Williams, the bitcoin’s wildly fluctuating value – which spiked to almost $1,200 a year ago but has dropped to its current rate of about $298 – makes it much riskier than standard currency and even gold or stocks.\n\n“In its current form, the bitcoin is extremely dangerous,” Williams said. “It needs to be amply tested before it’s allowed to be unleashed in our global economy.”\n\nWilliams acknowledges that Andreessen, venture capitalist Tim Draper and other Silicon Valley heavyweights are investing heavily in bitcoin-related firms.\n\n“You have a lot of smart money behind bitcoins, but smart money can make bad decisions,” Williams said.\n\nBitcoin Boulevard\n\nEven Garzik, as big a bitcoin booster as they come and more knowledgeable about it than virtually anyone else on the planet, said its future might not be as a widely used currency but rather one that saw its technology adapted toward other useful and profitable ends.\n\nGarzik foresees the day when the underlying software and related technology will be used to move other things of value securely among people, almost instantaneously and with full transparency.\n\n“There are various projects to try to use that technology not for currency purposes but to repurpose it to track ownership of stocks, cars and houses,” he said. “You could take one-thousandth of a penny worth of bitcoin and attach it to a property deed, a car contract or a stock certificate and transfer ownership using the blockchain. In that case, the bitcoin itself would be just a token. Its monetary value would be functionally worthless.”\n\nAlong those lines, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, 2008 U.S. Olympic rowers who’ve become major Internet entrepreneurs, place the value of the overall bitcoin system at $400 billion – 100 times greater than the value of all the bitcoins in circulation.\n\nWhatever its eventual fate, bitcoin as currency has relatively few users so far – whether consumers or merchants – except for some hotspots in Portland, Ore., New York, Las Vegas, British Columbia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong and a handful of other locales.\n\nLast month, financial services regulators in New York, the first state to craft rules for digital currencies, said start-ups and other small business that wanted to use bitcoin could get two-year BitLicenses.\n\nIn The Hague, the Dutch seat of government, which aspires to become the bitcoin capital of the world, 100 BTMs are being installed in the central district. In March, nine restaurants and an art gallery on two facing canal streets began accepting bitcoins as payment on what they pegged Bitcoin Boulevard.\n\nEvan Rose is the chief executive officer of Genesis Coin in San Diego. His firm wrote the software used on the BTM in the Adams Morgan diner and in scores of other bitcoin ATMs elsewhere in the world.\n\nWhile Rose is uncertain whether bitcoins will become widely used currency, he thinks that more consumers are spending them now than meets the eye.\n\nAn online firm called coinforcoffee.com, for example, allows Starbucks drinkers to use bitcoins by converting them into digital Starbucks cards. More broadly, gyft.com converts bitcoins in selling virtual smartphone gift cards to dozens of the country’s biggest retail outlets.\n\n“There are a lot of third-party services that integrate bitcoins with merchants,” Rose said. “Starbucks, Best Buy, Wal-Mart and other stores may be accepting bitcoins without knowing it.”\n\n‘We’re going to wait and see’\n\nDespite bitcoin’s slowly growing popularity, Germany is the only country known to have classified it as a currency.\n\nMany nations place heavy restrictions on bitcoin’s use, while China and Russia are among those that have outlawed it as legal tender.\n\nThe U.S. government regulated bitcoin commerce for several years through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the Treasury Department – not exactly a show of confidence in the digital currency.\n\nEleven years ago, Mahoney convinced Constantine Stavropoulos, owner of The Diner, to put an ATM in the restaurant. Earlier this year he persuaded the Greek-American entrepreneur, who has six eateries and coffeehouses in Washington, to host a BTM.\n\nThe BTM, near The Diner’s entrance, has done 74 transactions since it was installed Nov. 24.\n\nJohn McKee, who owns and operates both machines, had to jump through endless regulatory hoops to install his BTM. It took eight months of wrangling before officials with the Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking in the District of Columbia signed off on the plan.\n\n“They had a lot of questions,” McKee recalled. “It wasn’t on their priority list; let’s put it that way. This is a new technology. The lawyers were trying to figure it out, the regulators were trying to figure it out, everyone was trying to figure it out. There were a lot of hands in the pot trying to make a yes-or-no decision.”\n\nMcKee must carry tens of thousands of dollars in cash as he restocks dozens of traditional ATMS in the greater Washington region. By contrast, the BTM at The Diner, his first and only so far, requires only a few thousand dollars because it’s seeing less action.\n\nPart of the reason may be Stavropoulos himself, whose contradictory approach to bitcoin symbolizes the broader debate around the digital currency.\n\nDespite being excited about hosting the city’s first BTM, Stavropoulos doesn’t accept bitcoin for payment at his six establishments.\n\n“We are going to discover whether or not this thing is going to be the wave of the future or just a fad,” Stavropoulos said recently as he nursed a cup of coffee at The Diner’s counter. “We’re going to wait and see. If it turns out that a lot of people use bitcoins in the city, we would probably considering accepting them.”\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article gave the wrong last name for ATM scout Andy Mahoney.', 'Apple has approved a retro-styled iOS game that tips players in real bitcoin, recently releasing it onto the iTunes store.\n\nThe game, SaruTobi, lets users swing a monkey from a vine, building up momentum before releasing him to collect power-ups and bitcoin tokens as he frolics though the air.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, developer Christian Moss said:\n\n""SaruTobi is literally Japanese for \'Monkey Fly\', and this is pretty much the premise of the game. The user ... flings him across an 8-bit jungle collecting floating bitcoin along the way.""\n\nIntroduction to bitcoin\n\nMoss says he was in the process of adding typical Super Mario-style coins into the game when it occurred to him to use bitcoin instead. “I thought it would be a nice way to introduce bitcoin to people who are not familiar with it yet,” he said.\n\nThe iOS game has three main aims – attaining the greatest distance, collecting bitcoin tokens to be spent on in-app items, and collecting the letters \'SARUTOBI\' to unlock a bitcoin \'boost\' to spend on in-game items.\n\nMoss said: “The bitcoin tips come from the game’s shared bitcoin wallet, called a ‘pot’, revenue generated by the game (from in-app purchases and ads) is converted into bitcoin and added to the pot.”\n\nAfter the user has played the game for a certain amount of time, the game will reward the user by sending them a bitcoin tip.\n\nPlayers can view how much bitcoin is currently in the pot and also donate to keep it topped up. The more bitcoin there is, the more players will be tipped.\n\nInternational appeal\n\nThe main focus of the game is not to receive bitcoin tips, instead Moss considers them a way of rewarding players for using the game.\n\nBitcoin is also perfect for international use, he said, calling it a “people’s currency”. He pointed out that a player in Africa should feel just as at home with the digital currency as a player in America or the UK.\n\nLike other bitcoin games, such as Coinding, SaruTobi uses micro-transactions to send small amounts of bitcoin. However, where most games generally want the user to spend bitcoin, SaruTobi rewards them with it.\n\nMoss said:\n\n“I have come across a few concept games that use bitcoin micro-transactions, however nothing on the iOS app store … I believe having a popular iOS app that incorporates bitcoin can go along way to helping it become mainstream.”\n\nAdditionally, Moss indicated that he is currently working on a new bitcoin mining game. ""it’s still in the early stages of development,"" he said, ""but the player will be able to dig, similar to Minecraft, and collect real bitcoin.”\n\nSaruTobi is now available on the iTunes store for free download.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was one of the more vocal US government entities on the subject of bitcoin in 2014, holding a hearing to discuss its role in options and futures, claiming regulatory oversight over the derivatives market and speculating on how it might intervene in the digital currency ecosystem.\n\nPerhaps most notably, however, CFTC Commissioner Mark Wetjen penned an opinion piece heralding the technology’s potential to transform the industries his agency oversees.\n\nBut while the CFTC and Wetjen in particular have been open with their views on bitcoin, the organisation as a whole has been less clear on how it will proceed with providing more clarity to bitcoin businesses going forward.\n\nOutstanding questions include how bitcoin fits under existing definitions of commodities, what would inspire the agency to investigate potential market manipulation and how it views activities in the global bitcoin derivatives market.\n\nDuring a new interview with CoinDesk, Wetjen opened up about these issues and more, although he suggested that the agency itself currently has no way forward on any of these concerns. Rather, it is the bitcoin industry that will decide when and how further action will occur.\n\nWetjen said:\n\n“It depends on whether there is anything bitcoin-related for the CFTC to consider. At the moment, there\'s nothing before the CFTC itself to decide upon.”\n\nHe suggested that the CFTC would consider platforms and contracts that incorporate bitcoin to examine how they fall under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), but noted that the agency can only react to proposals it has received. To date, the CFTC has approved only one bitcoin derivative, that issued by New Jersey-based swap execution facility TeraExchange.\n\nThe interview, however, follows a year when bitcoin derivatives and other forms of advanced financial trading were more widely embraced by the industry globally as a way to hedge against volatility, thereby helping to stabilize the price of bitcoin.\n\nWetjen is one of four CFTC commissioners appointed directly by the US president and Senate, and accountable to organisation chairman Timothy Massad.\n\n‘No choice’ but to examine bitcoin\n\nWhile Wetjen admitted he has been personally excited to learn more about the technology underlying bitcoin, he said the agency itself had “no choice” but to focus on the subject last year.\n\nHe explained that, when faced with TeraExchange’s filing for its now-approved derivatives contract, the organisation had to respond appropriately.\n\n“In that respect, the issue was forced upon us in some ways,” he said.\n\nHowever, Wetjen said that the 9th October hearing that addressed bitcoin was more of a passion project given his fascination with digital currency.\n\n“I had an interest in this emerging technology and I believed it was important to have a public discussion about the technology and how it might impact our work at the Commission. As a vehicle for that discussion, I used an advisory committee that I sponsor,” he explained.\n\nIn this instance, the hearing also turned out to interest others. More than 5,000 people logged on to view the webcast, a figure that was said to be the largest the organisation has had for any of its meetings.\n\nThe role of market manipulation\n\nOf note, is that, while the CFTC has stated that bitcoin is a commodity, the agency has yet to define precisely what type of commodity it is.\n\nAs noted by New York Law School professor Houman Shadab, author of one of the more comprehensive papers addressing bitcoin and the derivatives market, the CEA classifies commodities into three categories: agricultural commodities, such as soybean and wheat; excluded commodities, such as prices and price indices; and exempt commodities, a catch-all term that includes precious metals.\n\nWetjen indicated that while bitcoin has attributes of both excluded and exempt commodities, the CFTC has not yet had the opportunity to provide a definitive answer.\n\nStill, he outlined how he thinks such a decision could come to pass, stating:\n\n“I believe what might precipitate more serious consideration of the issue is if someone from the market were attempting to manipulate the bitcoin cash market to benefit a position that they have in a bitcoin-derivative position. CFTC staff would be responsible for investigating and determining whether that activity constitutes a violation of the CEA.”\n\n“At that point, staff would begin a more analytical approach to determine where bitcoin fits into our statute’s commodity definition,” he explained.\n\nBitcoin under the CEA\n\nBarring such an instigating event, Wetjen emphasized how bitcoin is currently captured under the CEA due to the broad nature of the document. In particular, he noted a passage he believes best provides evidence that bitcoin falls under its mandate.\n\n""One of those component parts provides that a commodity includes any ‘rights or interests in which a contract for future delivery is or will be dealt in,’ and it\'s that part of the definition that I think best captures something like bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nStill, he stressed the limited the nature that such an interpretation affects the CFTC, stressing that the CEA grants the commission the authority only to regulate contracts for sale of a commodity at a future date that are then traded on regulated exchanges.\n\nThe CFTC, he said, does not have extensive oversight over bitcoin exchanges that do not offer derivatives contracts.\n\n“Where market participants are simply buying and selling bitcoin on an exchange, we wouldn\'t have oversight responsibilities for those exchanges,” he added.\n\nHere again, the subject of market manipulation, and how it could inspire the CFTC to further examine bitcoin, was reiterated. Wetjen, for example, said that the CFTC does have anti-manipulation and fraud authority in the cash markets.\n\n""In an instance where there are manipulative or fraudulent activities in the cash market, that is the type of case where the definition of a commodity comes into play and we can use that authority to prosecute bad behavior in the cash market,"" Wetjen clarified.\n\nNo intention to \'skew market\'\n\nWetjen also speculated on the role the CFTC could play in helping to shape an industry that is still in its early stages.\n\nFor example, he suggested that he doesn’t believe that regulation will encourage already-regulated companies, such as TeraExchange, to move quickly in the market, thereby potentially threatening any startups.\n\n“I don\'t really look at it that way. If someone wants to hedge their bitcoin exposure, and if they\'re US persons, then they need to do that on a regulated, licensed exchange, such as a swaps execution facility, designated contract market or a foreign board of trade,” he said, adding:\n\n”We\'re not trying to skew the market. We\'re trying to make sure that our statutory mandate is being met and that the public is being protected accordingly.”\n\nHowever, he issued a somewhat stern warning to US bitcoin merchants that may already be using derivatives platforms that aren\'t yet registered with the CFTC.\n\n""If they are a US person, trading a derivative contract and the derivative contract is listed by a company that is not licensed by the CFTC, then they should be concerned. Depending on the facts, there could be a violation of our rules,"" he said.\n\nFurther action \'far off\'\n\nGenerally positive about the ecosystem as a whole, Wetjen speculated that his agency won’t likely be bringing any added attention to digital currencies anytime soon.\n\nWhen asked how it would move forward on the subject in 2015, Wetjen reiterated that this is dependant on the bitcoin market itself.\n\n""Looking out over the first quarter of next year, I, for one, don\'t see compelling reasons to host another meeting, but things could change,"" he said.\n\nFor now, this means the CFTC may be simply interested observer of the bitcoin market even as larger questions linger, a role that Wetjen suggested perhaps best defines himself at the moment.\n\nWetjen concluded:\n\n“There are plenty of other use cases for the underlying technology beyond or apart from the need for hedging against changes in the value of bitcoin. The other potential uses of the bitcoin technology are as interesting to me as the role we have as an agency.”\n\nMark Wetjen image via the CFTC; US capitol via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, the FTC is still suing the company as part of an ongoing case, and a number of customers have taken separate legal action against the company in a bid to recover damages for shipment delays.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Butterfly Labs vice president Jeff Ownby explained his company\'s view on the developing situation:\n\n""On 23rd December, the Court handed control of the company and assets back to Butterfly Labs. Monarch shipments resumed on 29th December. Bank and bitcoin accounts were returned to us on December 30th. Payment of refunds in bitcoin resumed on December 31 and activations of cloud mining service also started on this day.""\n\nAlthough Butterfuly Labs was allowed to resume limited operations in October while it was managed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company’s options remained limited until late December.\n\nCustomer impact\n\nOn its website, Butterfly Labs states that its operations are still ""severely limited"", and that it needs to assess all aspects of its business and determine the damage caused by the temporary shutdown last year.\n\nCustomers who ordered Monarch miners could see their shipments fulfilled with added discounts, or can submit a request for a refund. Refunds can be requested on the customer dashboard, via the Refund Request page.\n\n""Had the company not been shut down, the order queue probably would have been fulfilled by early November 2014,"" Ownby asserted.\n\nRefund pricing information can be found on the updated website.\n\nRefunds resume\n\nButterfly Labs said refund and rebate payments will be processed in the order received, including those which were on hold during the FTC action.\n\nOwnby also dismissed rumours that the FTC forced the company to start refunding customers, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""Contrary to reports in some publications that we\'re only now paying refunds due to the FTC, we were paying refunds well before the shutdown. In fact, the shutdown stopped all refunds. Now that we\'re back in control, refunds have resumed.""\n\nThe company clarified its timetable for fiat and bitcoin refunds, as well, in formal announcements.\n\n“We will resume paying refunds and rebates as soon as we’re operationally ready,"" the company said. ""We anticipate being able to start paying refunds in bitcoin in January. Because the cost of the temporary receivership and our legal defense against the FTC have consumed a substantial portion of our cash reserves, we anticipate being able to resume cash refund and rebate payments in late January or February.”\n\nButterfly Labs also said it is handling all return merchandise authorization (RMA) requests and getting in touch with customers that submitted requests and did not hear back from the company, advising customers to check their dashboards and spam folders for messages.\n\nComputer mining image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Copay is an open-source project led by BitPay, which processes Microsoft’s Bitcoin payments. The app made its debut on Tuesday, the first day of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nBitPay said in a press release issued Tuesday that it had been steadily designing and building the app since early last year for its own corporate use. The firm built Copay’s software with the aim of offering an open-source foundation on which ultra-secure Bitcoin wallet services can be developed. Bitcoin said the software is used for transactions that need multiple authorizations, making it ideal for corporate fund management.\n\n“This is one of our contributions to the Bitcoin technology,” said BitPay CEO Stephen Pair in the news release. “Microsoft’s support has enable us to make our code available to a new group of developers and companies. We look forward to seeing how Copay evolves.”\n\nBitPay is encouraging developers to review and build upon the Copay software, as well as produce robust wallets and commercial services based on the software.\n\nOn its official blog, BitPay notes that Copay, which is the first Bitcoin wallet platform available on Windows Phone, is still in beta, so the demo should not be used for large transactions or storage.\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase announced Wednesday a revamped version of its mobile applications for Android and iOS. The company said on its blog that the apps have been redesigned from the ground up, leveraging the latest versions of Android and iOS to offer users the best possible wallet experience.\n\nWith the redesigned apps, users can:\n\nInstantly buy and sell Bitcoin in 19 nations;\n\nSend and request money by Bitcoin address, email, and QR code;\n\nShop with merchants who accept the digital currency;\n\nView balance, transaction history, and transaction details for multiple accounts; and\n\nAccess their Coinbase account on the go in a secure and convenient manner.\n\nCoinbase said the revamped apps are equipped with new security features, including:\n\nSupport for TouchID on iOS;\n\nSupport for 1Password if users store their passwords with this service;\n\nRevoking the app’s access from coinbase.com if a user’s device is lost or stolen; and\n\nEnhanced PIN lock functionality.\n\nCoinbase is welcoming feedback on its apps, and also encouraging users to share what they would like to see in future versions.', ""Mike Hearn one of the Bitcoin project's core developers is preparing to launch the beta of the Lighthouse crowdfunding platform, one which looks set to change how core Bitcoin development is funded.\n\nMaking use of an under-implemented conditionality function built into Bitcoin's central code, Lighthouse opens the door to users easily creating contractual and crowdfund style Bitcoin transactions.\n\nAnnouncing the beginning stages of pushing Lighthouse into it's beta state on the Google groups page,\n\nHearn's project has been tipped as the future way in which the core code development of Bitcoin can be funded outside of contributions from the Bitcoin Foundation. The developer has made his concerns about the state of the central code known, speaking in 2014 he explained that “it's pretty terrifying how big this thing has become on such a shaky foundation”. Having a native crowdfunding platform would allow supporters to back Bitcoin development by pledging funds to specific projects with the platform.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to Hearn about what he hoped the Lighthouse platform would allow Bitcoin users to start doing:\n\n“My biggest hope for Lighthouse is that it helps prove to the world that Bitcoin's features aren't just hype at conferences - they can be converted into real products that help real people. Existing crowdfunding platforms can easily soak up 10% of the funds you raise, and aren't even available in most countries. Lighthouse is a great demonstration of how Bitcoin can dis-intermediate expensive middlemen - it's free, fast, works everywhere and puts the user in control”. “More specifically Lighthouse can do ‘crowdfunds’ that don't fit our pre-conceived notions of what a crowdfund is. Think about friends doing a group buy for concert tickets, a drama group raising money to put on a show, and so on. These projects don't fit existing platform policies and the overheads would be too big anyway. With Lighthouse, they could make sense. I'd love to see people explore new ways to use all-or-nothing fundraising.”\n\nThe ongoing development is mostly funded by the Bitcoin Foundation, an organization that has come under fire for paying only three developers. Mostly funded through corporate and private donations, the Bitcoin Foundation has been accused of a lack of transparency on decision making with Hearn suggesting that “people aren't always motivated to donate when they don't feel they have any impact on how the money will be spent.”\n\nThe Lighthouse platform for crowdfunding in Bitcoin, would allow core development projects in Bitcoin to be suggested and backed by the same corporations and private individuals, but with greater control over the direction and force of the projects. Bitcoin millionaire Olivier Janssens has already pledged US$50,000 to the first Bitcoin development project to be listed on the site. The lack of fees, and decentralized nature of Lighthouse will also allow users to begin crowdfunding projects that don't fit well with existing platforms such as Kickstarter and IndieGoGo.\n\nHearn, the former Google engineer and architect of Bitcoin's Java implementation “Bitcoinj”, made headlines in 2014 winning a US$ 40,000 bounty payment for the early proofs of Lighthouse's ability to create projects and allowing users to pledge Bitcoin funds to them. The bounty was another part of the overall US$100,000 offered by Olivier Janssens to develop a system that would work independently of the Bitcoin Foundation to fund future core Bitcoin development projects. Criticizing the Bitcoin Foundation's internal structure Janssens explained:\n\n“Bitcoin is the currency of the internet generation. It puts the power back into the hands of the people. You cannot expect its main representative organization to be exactly the opposite: A non-transparent, political and secretive elite.”\n\nHearn's imminent launch of the beta of Lighthouse will surely please Jannsens but, more importantly, it can open new doors in the way people crowdfund a whole new type and range of projects.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

In the end, the project consumed more than six days of his time, although it also seems to have found an interested audience.\n\nAccording to Scott, the database has already been viewed more than 8,000 times six days after it was published on 30th December. The project is funded by donations (he has received about £100 so far) and he encourages users of the database to tip him in bitcoin.\n\nQuality of work varies\n\nThe self-titled \'alternative finance explorer\' is the author of The Heretic\'s Guide to Global Finance, a book about the financial system and how ordinary people can use it for ""guerrilla finance"" and ""activist entrepreneurialism"".\n\nHe gave the quality of research on bitcoin that he found a relatively good grade overall (B+), but with the addition of some important qualifiers.\n\n""Quality to some extent is in the eye of the beholder, but I\'ll be honest – there is a fair amount of crap research out there,"" he wrote in a blog post introducing his database.\n\nScott himself has a fair amount of academic experience. He is a lecturer at the Camberwell College of Arts and carried out research at Cambridge University under the noted economist Ha-Joon Chang. In between, he has been a derivatives broker and a fellow of the Finance Innovation Lab, an incubator, in London.\n\nCrunching the numbers\n\nAn analysis of Scott\'s database shows a rapidly rising quantity of research centred on bitcoin, revealing an academia that is increasingly grappling with the subject.\n\nThe amount of published work grows from one in 2008 – Satoshi\'s seminal white paper – to none the following year, and then one paper in 2010. It increases eight-fold the following year before tripling in 2012. The next year again sees a three-fold increase, to 61 papers, before an explosion of 205 papers hits the reading public in 2014.\n\nScott predicts that this year will see even more research on the cryptocurrency. He also notes that the peer-review process for the most prestigious journals can take years, so a lag in in published work is to be expected.\n\n""There will be a big flood of research ... good research takes a while to do, especially in the social sciences,"" he wrote.\n\nSocial sciences \'underrepresented\'\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly the bulk of research is technical, delving into cryptography, computer science and systems design, Scott finds.\n\nThere is a also a large amount of work on the regulatory and legal questions surrounding bitcoin. The economics of the digital currency are another area of academic fascination, with an Austrian flavour to the work.\n\nCrunching the numbers of Scott\'s database shows that, apart from independently published efforts, the two sources with the most bitcoin research are the papers collected from last year\'s Financial Cryptography and Data Security conference and the Business Information Systems Workshops that also took place last year. The Journal of Peer Production is the third most popular host for bitcoin work.\n\nThe open-access platform arXiv, operated by the Cornell University Library, is the most popular place for independent researchers to publish their work, with 35 pieces accounted for in Scott\'s database.\n\nThe social sciences are underrepresented, Scott says. He calls for deeper ethnographic and geographic analysis of bitcoin, as well as critical engagement with the implications of a decentralised, algorithm-driven system.\n\n""This research remains hugely underrepresented, which is ironic, because it\'s by far the most important area of research,"" he writes.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It is a market that simply just cannot be ignored any longer,” said iceCUBED founder Gareth Grobler in a media statement.\n\nBitcoin has been extremely popular over the last couple of years, and has been made available in more markets than ever before. The price per Bitcoin skyrocketed to a high of $1 242 (R14 000) at the end of November in 2013, after which it started to steady lose value. Currently, one Bitcoin will cost you around $300 (R3 500).\n\nOfficial trading in Naira will begin on the 12th of January, and potential traders can sign up to verify their accounts from today.\n\nAdvert\n\nIn case you are still not sure how the cryptocurrency works, you can check out the video below:\n\n[Image – Bitcoin.org', ""For those who exist in the gray and darker areas of the legal spectrum, pre-paid “burner” phones offer a convenient, workable way to avoid surveillance. Buy a phone at a gas station with some prepaid minutes, call or text your clients, get rid of the phone before the authorities are even aware of the number.\n\nThere are problems with that method. The hardware is an unnecessary expense, gas station attendants might wonder why you keep buying new, cheap phones and of course there is a stigma attached to carrying multiple phones. Not everyone with the need for a disposable number exists in that aforementioned gray and dark areas, after all.\n\nThere are mobile apps that act as a burner, but they require connections to credit cards and other personal information and the most popular ones expire if you don't pay a monthly fee.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies aren't going to make communication cheaper. That is the Internet's job and it is doing it very well. Whatsapp, Skype, WeChat, and similar apps are the tools that the old guard fear, because with them, we have little need for traditional telecommunication companies. It is worth pointing out that ChiliPhone has reportedly come in with lower prices than long-distance phone companies, it seems unlikely that it can compete with internet based chat clients.\n\nWhat BitSMS has been doing and what ChiliPhone is now doing, (intentionally or not) is letting users pay a small premium to not have that thread of communication picked up by traditional surveillance methods.\n\nIt should be pointed out that these services aren't completely anonymous. If the NSA or GCHQ or another well-funded spying organization wants to look at your communication specifically, they likely can. While BitSMS and ChiliPhone don't require any personal information, your PC itself could be being monitored by authorities, including everything you record or type.\n\nStill, when dealing with local law enforcement who rely on more traditional methods like tapping phones, or wanting to avoid the massive and indiscriminate spying “sweeps” of organizations like the NSA, BitSMS and ChiliPhone can be easy to use tools.\n\nBitSMS recently lowered their prices (to about US $0.11) per text, and they accept a few altcoins in addition to Bitcoin (Sterlingcoin, Guldencoin and Darkcoin). Better yet, you can send any of those cryptocurrencies through text message using BitSMS. If you wanted to buy something from your friend anonymously, or pay him or her back for a previous debt, you could send the payment and the details in the same message.\n\nChiliPhone allows you to make phone calls using bitcoin. You simply put in a phone number, they will price in in mBTC per minute, hit connect, and the call goes through. The cost is small: domestic calls were on the order of 0.07 mBTC (or 0.00007 BTC) per minute. Not insignificant, but not too high of a barrier of entry. Any unused bitcoin will be returned to your ChiliPhone wallet, which can be emptied at anytime and will automatically return any remaining bitcoin to the addresses that sent it originally, every thirty days.\n\nThese solutions to the “The Great Millennial Spying Problem” are not complete ones. They are not even on the level of something like Silent Circle. The so-called “Five Eyes” governments spy on the vast numbers of people in some way. Most of them, even the guilty few, use regular methods of communications. Most drug dealers for an example, still communicate with simple text and phone conversations. BitSMS and ChiliPhone let you dodge at least the vast sweep up of conversations without forcing the party on the other side to participate. Agencies will still pick up your message, but at least they won't know who sent it without doing some digging.\n\nThese two companies may not enjoy my characterization of them. It is important to note that nothing on either website talks about the ability to send messages while avoiding the NSA, or promoting any kind of activity that would catch their ire. They aren't even real privacy tools. But, when I see their ease of use and crypto integration, I can't help but think first line of defense, and that is something that can't be said for the likes of Skype.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

01/09/2015,"['Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp has resumed services after having gone offline following a damaging hot wallet attack on 5th January that saw the exchange lose 19,000 BTC.\n\nThe exchange announced today that its website is once again open for business and made note of a host of new services being offered to Bitstamp customers.\n\nBitstamp\'s blog post announcing its return to business details how the exchange has rebuilt its systems ""from the ground up"" in an effort to prevent a repeat of its recent security breach.\n\nUpdates to the exchange service include a migration to Amazon\'s AWS cloud infrastructure, new hardware systems and the integration of BitGo\'s multi-signature wallet technology.\n\nAs a consolation for being offline in recent days, Bitstamp is also offering commission-free trading to all of its customers until 17th January at 11:59pm UTC.\n\nBitstamp\'s website indicates trading will resume at 21:00 UTC 9th January.\n\nWe are pleased to confirm that customers have resumed normal bitcoin transaction activity on http://t.co/4J0wH6JrRG — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) January 9, 2015\n\nTimeline of the attack and outage\n\nThe hackers struck on Sunday, 4th January, and on Monday Bitstamp reported a hot wallet issue, advising customers not to deposit bitcoin to old addresses. Later that day the exchange revealed that it lost roughly 19,000 BTC in the breach, valued at upwards of $5m at the time of the attack.\n\nBitstamp said a number of wallets were compromised and, upon learning of the breach, the exchange issued warnings and started to suspend operations. Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodri? said the breach represented a “small fraction” of the exchange’s total reserves, as the majority of the reserves are held offline in cold storage.\n\nOn Tuesday, Slovenian media reported that the site would resume operations within 24 hours, quoting Bitstamp co-founder Damijan Merlak. Merlak told Slovenian state-owned news agency STA that the exchange had enough liquid assets to meet short term-obligations and that it was in the process of setting up a duplicate infrastructure in cooperation with experts in San Francisco.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Kodri? tweeted that the redeployment is being filled with backup data for testing, giving an ETA of 24-48 hours for the re-launch.\n\nOur redeployment is up internally and is being filled with backup data for testing. Relaunch ETA ~24-48h. Thank you for your patience! — Nejc Kodri? (@nejc_kodric) January 6, 2015\n\nKodri? also used Twitter to reassure customers that their balances held at Bitstamp prior to 5th of January are safe and will be honoured in full. He went on to tweet several updates, pointing out that he still does not have an exact time for the re-launch yet.\n\nMy earlier tweet of 48 hours was a rough timeframe. We are testing our redeployed system internally before going live again to customers. — Nejc Kodri? (@nejc_kodric) January 7, 2015\n\nKodri? said he would keep Bitstamp users informed via Twitter updates and the company website.

Almost exactly a year ago, the company announced it would be accepting bitcoin as a form of payment on its website, and in the release today Overstock said more than $3 million worth of Bitcoin purchases have been made to date.\n\nAllowing employees to receive their salaries in bitcoin will be a step toward making the currency more mainstream, said CEO Patrick Byrne. In fact, the company is taking another step: it’s installing a bitcoin ATM in its Salt Lake City, Utah, headquarters.\n\n“Moving cryptocurrencies out of the realm of geeks and into the realm of the rest of us requires making changes at all levels of the financial ecosystem,” Byrne said in a release. “An important part of this effort is making digital money ATM accessible.”\n\nThe ATM will be available to the public too, allowing users to convert U.S. dollars into bitcoin, and vice-versa. It will be open 24 hours a day.\n\nBitcoin is becoming increasingly popular for retailers, with major companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Fortune publisher Time Inc. (TIME) announcing in recent months that they’ll be accepting the cryptocurrency.\n\nThis is a far cry from the early days of the bitcoin craze, when the currency was largely linked with the now-shut down “Silk Road,” which was allegedly used to sell drugs and other illicit items.', 'Bitcoin had a rough 2014, but there was one silver lining: Over the past year, a steady trickle of large companies have begun taking bitcoin as payment. Ever since Overstock.com announced it would start accepting bitcoin roughly one year ago, a number of major brands, including Microsoft, Dell, and MONEY’s own publisher, Time Inc., have done the same.\n\nThis has been a ray of light in an otherwise dismal period for bitcoin supporters, and few have missed the chance to trumpet such adoption as an indicator of bitcoin’s success. One WIRED article even used the currency’s recent adoption by a section of the Fortune 500 as the core piece of evidence for bitcoin’s importance.\n\n“Irrespective of your opinion, the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies cannot be ignored,” the post reads. “Today, there are a number of billion dollar businesses that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. These include Dell, Reddit, Expedia, PayPal, and most recently, Microsoft. So for the uninitiated who have not yet grasped what Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are, you ought to catch up.”\n\nIn other words, Hey haters, look at all these huge companies that are accepting bitcoin! How can you ignore that kind of support?\n\nWell, there’s just one problem there: Almost none of the businesses mentioned above technically accept bitcoin. Instead, they partner with a middleman—generally either Coinbase or BitPay—who takes a customer’s bitcoin, immediately converts it into cash, and then deposits the cash in the company’s bank account.\n\nIn other words, Dell, Expedia, Microsoft, and Time, Inc. don’t actually “accept” bitcoins, per se. They accept U.S. dollars. It’s their bitcoin processing partners who accept bitcoin. They, in turn, make money on transaction fees (in the case of Coinbase), or by selling their software and services as a subscription (in the case of BitPay).\n\nBitPay, which has partnered with Microsoft, Newegg, and other merchants, confirmed to MONEY that the majority of its major clients ask that their bitcoins be instantly converted to cash. “I would say as a general trend most of our larger business do choose a settlement in 100% U.S. dollars because that’s how they do their accounting and finance,” said Tony Gallippi, co-founder and executive chairman of BitPay.\n\nThat’s a rather charitable explanation of why companies take fiat over bitcoin when given the choice. In reality, it’s probably because they simply don’t trust bitcoin as a stable store of value. Since Dell began accepting bitcoin through Coinbase in July 2014, bitcoin’s value has dropped by over 54 percent. If Dell had actually kept the cryptocurrency it received, its revenue from bitcoin sales would have essentially been cut in half.\n\nEven Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne, one of bitcoin’s most outspoken supporters, doesn’t think bitcoin is worth embracing in full. His company, which also uses Coinbase, keeps 90% of bitcoin transaction revenue in dollars. Considering the magnitude of Bitcoin’s price drop, Overstock has likely still paid a heavy price for Byrne’s enthusiasm.\n\nAll of this is not to say more companies taking bitcoin—even through a middleman—is a bad thing for the currency. At the very least, it gives bitcoin holders something (legal) to spend their money on, and increases bitcoin’s utility, which, in the long run, could make it a more viable medium of exchange. Cryptocurrency fans should be naming their first born children after Coinbase and BitPay executives since there would probably still be no major businesses accepting bitcoin at all without these companies offering full conversion services.\n\nBut make no mistake, just because Dell and the like are letting their customers pay in bitcoin doesn’t mean they believe in the currency. It’s just that intermediary services have made it possible to accept bitcoin without really accepting it. If anything, that shows corporations still don’t trust bitcoin with the one thing a currency needs to do: hold its worth. That’s the metric we should be using to measure bitcoin’s success, not by counting the number of merchants with a Coinbase link on their checkout page.', 'Even Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive creator of bitcoin, admitted that his invention is hard to explain–because there is nothing you can compare it to. Here is how a bitcoin transaction is processed:\n\n1) Payers initiate a bitcoin payment using ""wallet"" software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) This and other pending transactions are broadcast on the global bitcoin network.\n\n3) Once every ten minutes or so, ""miners"", specialised computers (or groups of computers) on this network, collect a few hundred transactions and combine them in a ""block"".\n\n4) In order to mine a block and validate the transaction, miners compete to solve a difficult mathematical equation (a ""hash function""). The miner that solves the equation first further processes the block and broadcasts this ""proof-of-work"" to the bitcoin network.\n\n5) The other miners check the proof-of-work and the validity of the transactions. If they approve, the winning miner gets a reward of 25 newly minted bitcoin (about $6,900 at current prices), which is the incentive for miners to provide computing power. Adjusting the difficulty of the puzzle ensures that the supply of new bitcoins remains steady.\n\n6) The mined block is added to the ""blockchain"", a big, unbreakable ledger that lives on the bitcoin network and serves as a record of all transactions.\n\n7) The payee can use his wallet software to see whether the bitcoin have arrived.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nMinting bitcoin has become a big, ruthlessly competitive business (Jan 2015)\n\nThe Economist explains: How does bitcoin work? (April 2013)', 'The notoriously difficult Apple App Store approval process has given its blessing to a game that tips users directly in BTC. Ad-supported, Super Mario-style game SaruTobi, which is Japanese for “flying monkey,” lets users earn BTC by playing well or simply by playing a certain amount of time. According to Reddit user bubbasparse, this length of time was “after a few tries of playing.”\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Gaming Cryptocurrency HYPER Launches 10 Game Servers\n\nThe obvious benefit to the Bitcoin ecosystem is the introduction of unassuming iOS gamers looking for a free game to play becoming initiated in Bitcoin, and this is not unintentional. Speaking to CoinDesk, developer Christian Moss said:\n\n“I thought it would be a nice way to introduce bitcoin to people who are not familiar with it yet.”\n\nThe tips are provided by a communal pool of bitcoins that is derived both from in-game purchases and advertising revenue. Users can buy Bitcoin to spend in the environment with the click of a button, presumably through their regular App Store channels. It is the first game in the Apple atmosphere to successfully navigate the channels of approval and deliver a quality experience while still introducing people to the digital currency.\n\nThe game works in a similar fashion to Flappy Birds, where it doesn’t end in levels but becomes progressively more difficult as your monkey swings ever further to the right of the screen. The further you get and the more power-ups you collect, the more Bitcoin you potentially earn. Users are able to monitor the status of the communal pot which pays out tips to dedicated users, an important feature that could ingratiate the game over others in the user’s mind and create a feeling of loyalty.\n\nWhile not the first game to reward users for playing by giving them bitcoins, Bitcoin2048 being a notable example, it is the first and hopefully not the last to penetrate the Apple digital goods store. It is available for free here (requires iOS 8.1 or later) and currently lacks reviews that improve its standing in the marketplace.\n\nImages from Bloomua and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'London-based startup Tibdit is to officially launch its new service on 19th January, allowing online content publishers to collect bitcoin micropayments through a WordPress website plug-in.\n\nThe new service could add to the rising interest in micro-transactions characterised by ChangeTip, a social media tipping tool.\n\nPayments to Tibdit can be made in bitcoin or with a credit or debit card, but must be collected in bitcoin. As a result, publishers will need a bitcoin address in order to cash out their funds. A demo of the service can be experienced here.\n\nThe company sets out a variety of scenarios in which Tibdit could be used for collecting tips, charitable donations or paid content. Bloggers, forums, reviewers, news sites, artists and local groups could all benefit from the service, it says.\n\nTibdit\'s founder and CEO Justin Maxwell said:\n\n""We hope it will result in people who will otherwise not have looked at bitcoin to get themselves a bitcoin address.""\n\nTibs not tips\n\nMaxwell said his service is currently used by only two blogs as the firm has not begun to market its service widely yet.\n\nTibdit plans to market itself to bloggers before approaching established publishers. Maxwell said his service is still in \'beta\' and that his team of four is looking to identify and resolve any problems that may arise with it.\n\nUsers who want to send funds on Tibdit have to purchase a bundle of \'tibs\' from the service using either bitcoin or a fiat payment card.\n\nUsers set the value of each bundle of tibs before they are used. When the desire arises to tip or donate to a site, users click the Tibdit button to send a tip of that pre-determined value.\n\nTibdit charges 1.5 pence per transaction for its service.\n\nTipping trends\n\nMaxwell met co-founder Pauline Hunter when they both worked in the British civil service at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

One user´s account was closed after he used his coins to buy cannabis seeds and another was closed because he bought coins on Coinbase and apparently sold them on Localbitcoins. While the use of coins to purchase such seeds could be questionable from a legal standpoint, selling your coins on another website is certainly not.\n\nThe California based company defended itself by claiming that these steps were necessary if they wanted to remain in compliance with regulations. Of course, these regulations do require companies to verify identities (Know your Customer) and monitor for possible criminal activity such as drug purchases and money laundering. But do these regulations require a company to pry into a customer’s credit history?\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke via telephone today with Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, on the need to verify its customers’ credit history:\n\n“Regulations require us to verify the identity of our customers. We use a number of methods to accomplish this, such as requiring identification and addresses and in many cases rely on third parties for verification. Because some of these third parties include credit history checks as part of their process we changed our user agreement to inform our customers of this possibility so that we could maintain transparency with them.”\n\nArmstrong wanted to make it clear that user privacy was important to Coinbase, but if the company was going to be able to provide customers the ability to move between Bitcoin and their banks, regulations must be complied with fully.\n\nThe company does accept verified credit cards and recently began allowing instant use of Bitcoin through its “USD Wallet”, which allows users with a US bank account to do an instant ACH bank transfer.\n\nCoinbase Users Not Happy\n\nExpectedly, Coinbase users are not happy with the new policy. One longtime customer, BitttBurger, said in a recent Reddit post:\n\n“I've been with Coinbase literally since day one. Love their service. Love the site. And I'm the last guy to care about regulations or rules or authority. But I'm not comfortable with them running my credit report. So I guess I have to cancel. “As a side note, the URL provided to cancel doesn't work. Redirects back to the Agreement. Guess I'm stuck.”\n\nAnother user, jimmajamma, made a much more interesting point: Most of us pay little attention to long and rambling Terms of Service and User Agreements. But he also added commented:\n\n“I think using bitcoin is like taking the red pill. You can now see the reality of the situation. Your money, simply a physical manifestation of your labor, is not really yours to save and spend as you please. It's monitored as you make it, as you deposit it and as you spend it. I think that concept is something people need to really do more thinking about. Essentially, you are not free to transact your physical labor. I don't think the state really has that right, but that's also another story going back to 1913.”\n\nConclusion\n\nThe fact is that Coinbase is a business that seeks to work within the legacy economic system, which of course means following the rules. But Coinbase is also an enterprise that wants to take advantage of any profit potential that might become available. Anyone doing business with companies such as Coinbase should understand this and, if privacy is an issue, then it is probably better to find a less intrusive Bitcoin service provider to use as your wallet.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

However, Coumans\' public appearances at conferences like Inside Bitcoins Hong Kong and office visits conducted by local bitcoin miners and media provided many customers with the required confidence to make purchases.\n\nCustomers were required to pay 35% of the production costs upfront, while miners were expected to be shipped in Q3 2014.\n\nTurning tide\n\nBusiness seemed to turn sour for MAT around the time the machines where supposed to ship in September. Scam accusations began to appear on several massage boards soon after.\n\nCustomers levied accusations of fraud and false advertising, claiming Coumans willfully lied about the speed of the chips. It was even asserted that no established partnership between MAT and Dream Chip Technologies existed. Dream Chip Technologies did not confirm or deny its involvement with MAT.\n\nMoreover, as the end of the September approached, only a small fraction of customers had received their machines. According to e-mails sent out by Coumans, there was a problem with the air cooling of the chips, which he said should be resolved shortly.\n\nControversy remains\n\nAccording to a source close to MAT that wishes to remain anonymous, the company had been in trouble since June, months before it stopped pre-orders.\n\n""MAT agreed to a joint venture with ASIC manufacturer Alcheminer, costing roughly $2m. As it turned out, however, pre-orders at MAT didn\'t add up to $2m-worth, which meant that MAT did not receive enough chips to meet all of these pre-orders,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nAlcheminer claims to have provided all of MAT\'s chips as promised, but says it hasn\'t been paid off in full. The source suggested MAT had insufficient funds to cover other costs required to build the ASIC miners, such as the cost of software and additional hardware, and that MAT engaged in questionable activities regarding its cloud mining operations.\n\nSuch statements were strongly contradicted by Coumans in a statement to CoinDesk.\n\n""All of this is a blatant smear campaign,” Coumans said. “Because of these false allegations, a lot of our customers became scared they would lose all of their downpayments. This led to many of them asking for refunds, while some big customers even canceled their contracts with us.""\n\nHe added: ""This is what led to MAT\'s bankruptcy.""\n\nCustomers remain waiting\n\nAppointed bankruptcy curator Spreksel only just started to research the company\'s bookkeeping and history this week, but told CoinDesk that it will take another three to five weeks before any sort of meaningful conclusions can be drawn.\n\nEstimates suggest that more than a dozen customers lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in investments with MAT, Spreksel said. Spreksel added that the prospects of any of MAT\'s customers and creditors having any money returned to them seems quite grim, but emphasized that it\'s too soon to know for sure.\n\nCoumans told CoinDesk that he was unable to provide any further information at the time of publishing, due to legal reasons.\n\nBankruptcy image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Circle, which launched its service in September, is cautiously optimistic that one way to capture the mainstream consumer\'s attention is with a technology that has experienced a resurgence of sorts thanks to Apple Pay.\n\nCircle earlier this week announced it added NFC functionality to its Android app. This comes almost two months after bitcoin processor BitPay added NFC support for its merchant-facing Checkout app to enable such payments between compatible devices.\n\n""Our customers wanted to use NFC and we have a partner like BitPay flushing out that functionality,"" Circle CTO Sean Neville told Mobile Payments Today in an interview. ""Based on the [customer] demand and presence on the merchant side, it was something that made sense for us to do.""\n\nNathalie Reinelt, an Aite Group analyst who tracks virtual currencies, said Circle\'s NFC addition to its Android app makes sense considering the current buzz about the technology.\n\n""It\'s not surprising that bitcoin wallet providers are attempting to ride the Apple Pay wave on NFC,"" she told Mobile Payments Today. ""Apple Pay received an enormous amount of press attention and by adding NFC; Circle is likely hoping it will make their bitcoin wallet more palatable to mainstream.""\n\nBoston-based Circle emerged from its beta phase in late 2014 and did not limit its online bitcoin digital wallet to the U.S. It focused on the international market from the start and made its website available in seven languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish. Since then, Circle has released iOS and Android apps and made them available in 31 countries.\n\nCircle saw customer demand for NFC functionality within the Android app from ""everywhere,"" not just from countries such as South Korea and Japan that have more mature contactless infrastructures than the U.S., Neville said.\n\n""It\'s kind of interesting because in the iOS world, there\'s a lot of debate over BLE and NFC versus other alternatives,"" Neville said. ""But as far as Android goes, the clamor for NFC support was pretty loud early on.""\n\nWhether the concept of NFC-enabled mobile bitcoin payments is enough to entice mainstream consumers to adopt the cryptocurrency for purchases seems like a stretch at this point. Neville said there is some optimism within Circle about NFC attracting more users outside of early adopters, but there are other issues that need to be addressed with those potential customers first.\n\nBitcoin wallet providers such as Circle will need to convince the non-early adopter crowd about the cryptocurrency\'s benefits before it has the chance to become a mainstream payment method, Neville said. The technology\'s enthusiasts have trumpeted those perceived benefits from the beginning and include the ability to use bitcoin as faster funds-transfer mechanism that costs pennies to use compared with traditional outlets such as Western Union.\n\n""As those mainstream users reap the benefits of cryptocurrencies, they may be pulled deeper into it and be aware of the underlying protocol of using it,"" Neville said.\n\nA bitcoin wallet provider\'s desire to attract more mainstream consumers might have become more difficult over the weekend when U.K.-based exchange Bitstamp suspended operations because it was hacked and lost 19,000 bitcoins worth $5 million. Bitstamp planned to resume operations by the end of the week.\n\nReinelt notes that obstacles remain for bitcoin wallet providers to attract more mainstream customers, maybe even more so now thanks to the Bistamp issue.\n\n""Simply adding NFC isn\'t going to be compelling enough to attract a significant number of mainstream users once consumers realize they have to set up a whole new account for bitcoin, transfer money from their existing bank account to their bitcoin account, take on the risks associated with bitcoin\'s volatility, and in light of the recent Bitstamp theft, continue to expose themselves to possible losses in the event those platforms are hacked, since consumers have zero insurance on bitcoin losses,"" she said.\n\nCircle does provide insurance to its users in the event of a unforseen circumstances.\n\n""There\'s a matter of helping to educate the public on how their money can be safe and how they can take control of their own funds,"" Neville said when asked about the Bitstamp situation. ""There is a need to insure that companies either in the traditional finance space or in this new cryptocurrency space have good cybersecurity and things like insurance to protect consumers.""\n\nMeantime, Circle plans to move forward soon with new product plans. Neville could not share specifics but said the company has seen healthy demand for its digital wallet.\n\n""In general, the response has been great and maybe a little better than we had reason to expect,"" he said.']"
01/10/2015,"['People are wondering when and at what price bitcoin will bottom and there are many opinions on this matter.\n\nThis article will not explore a certain price or date when bitcoin will bottom but some of the characteristics that need to be shown to know that a real bottom in place. Instead, this article will explore the concepts of panic selling and capitulation as well as what a bottom will look like if these things occur. To date, you have not seen either of these things play out in the bitcoin price, as the selling has been very orderly for quite a while.\n\nWhat are capitulation and panic selling?\n\nEssentially, capitulation comes from panic selling. In essence, capitulation is the final phase in an extreme downtrend when sellers are willing to get out at any price (this is where the term “panic selling” comes from). It happens on tremendous downside volume at time when there are no buyers to be found. This can be called a “buying strike.” This leads to a cascade of selling that becomes disorderly and looks like it may never end. This image defines it:\n\nNotice the orderly steps down at the beginning followed by a free-fall. The free-fall looks like the bottom but there is usually one more step down, which leads to despondency and malaise. It generally ends in a selling climax. The selling begets more selling and it looks like the price will never stop going down. Below is a chart of the S&P 500, which I have labeled based on the famous Fear and Greed cycle chart.\n\nHere is the S&P chart from 2007 until now:\n\nNotice in the chart above the increase in volume on the downside. Volume generally increases dramatically in down moves. The red line going through the volume is a 50 day moving average of volume and shows a massive increase as we entered panic selling and capitulation.\n\nAt bottoms, volume generally falls. This is because the selling reaches a climax and there is no one left to sell and the buyers have left the building. However, there are signs that finally the selling is done in the form of different chart patterns forming something that resembles a Bullish Engulfing Pattern or a Hammer with a very long tail (if you use Japanese Candlesticks). Tone Vays has done a great job of discussing these patterns here and showing what they look like.\n\nThe Bitcoin picture\n\nThe bitcoin chart has reached a state of denial according to the greed and fear cycle. Despite all of the good news, including the reopening of Bitstamp the price keeps heading lower.\n\nThe bulls keep holding on thinking the price has gotten low enough. Unfortunately it hasn’t. Until the perma-bulls start to get scared and start selling thinking the price is going to 0 as well as we see shuttering of mining activities and businesses closing their doors, it’s very hard to say we have a true bottom.\n\nBelow is the BTC chart where the selling has been too orderly and no bottoming patterns have taken shape.\n\nOnce we get to a point where people are no longer focusing on the price as the main indicator, the innovation in Bitcoin will become the focus again (which it should have always been) and there is a good chance that’s when we will see the real bottom as well.\n\nAbout the author\n\nGeorge Samman is the co-founder of BTC.sx, the world’s first Bitcoin-only trading platform.

But stability is important too: just over a year ago a bitcoin was worth four times as many dollars as now. The Mt.Gox affair and the recent problems at Bitstamp show that the Bitcoin economy still has many threats to face.\n\nThe media tend to report only the huge swings of Bitcoin price (and, recently, the fact that it always seems to go down). But these are not the only aspect of the Bitcoin story, and not the most important, as we have often said on CCN. The Economist confirms:\n\n“The price collapse and the exchanges’ woes do not tell the whole story, though: increasing numbers of businesses are accepting payment in bitcoin, including Time Inc and Microsoft; and whatever the fate of bitcoin, the technology may spawn a range of alternative crypto-currencies and provide the basis for other businesses involving such things as the transfer of assets.”\n\nThe article underlines the importance of providing incentives to the Bitcoin users who maintain the blockchain, and predicts that, with the decreasing profitability of mining, transaction fees will become the main incentive.\n\nAlso read: Post-Mining Bitcoin – Collapse or Sustainable Growth?\n\nNow, mining is big business. Individual home miners have given way to large operators that invest substantial money in mining farms in far away places with low temperatures and low electricity costs, and it can only be expected that the trend toward professional mining will continue.\n\n“Like other energy-intensive industries such as smelting aluminium, minting bitcoins is more efficiently done at scale, and in places where electricity is cheap and reliable. It also helps to be somewhere cold, to reduce the cost of cooling the machines. KnCMiner’s hangar is near the Arctic Circle and right next to a hydroelectric dam.”\n\nOf course, large-scale mining has environmental impacts, and if only a few large operators maintain the blockchain, then the stability of the Bitcoin system is threatened by 51% attacks. These factors will play a role in the more and more professionalized Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Since a few days ago, German bank Sparkasse, has been blocking cryptocurrency orders, returning money to customers, said Dutch cryptocurrency exchange Anycoin Direct.\n\nSeveral users banking at German bank Sparkasse, reported to Anycoin Direct that they were contacted by their banks with the message that the transactions to buy cryptocurrencies were blocked. Investigating on the matter, Anycoin Direct said that all payment methods available at Sparkasse are affected, including Sofort, online bank transfer and SEPA.\n\nSpokesperson Bram Ceelen told CoinTelegraph they had not been warned by Sparkasse, although Anycoin Direct tried desperately to contact them. Ceelen stated:\n\n""I don’t know why they have taken this action, especially without contacting us and ignoring our attempts to contact them [...] [Banks] abuse their power without any good reason or explanation.""\n\nThe company is still filing all the events in order to have a full report on what happened. So far, Anycoin Direct had received 6-7 reports from customers.\n\nFinancial damage is yet to be determined as Anycoin Direct used to send the cryptocurrencies once payments are said to be successful by their system, resulting in the exchange to send coins before realizing that payments to Sparkasse were blocked. The company stated it will no longer operate this way and will have to wait until the money arrives at their bank account before sending cryptocurrencies to users’ accounts.\n\nThe crypto exchange platform said it has been running an honest business and expressed confusion regarding the sudden change of position from Sparkasse.\n\nAnycoin Direct seems to be the only cryptocurrency exchange facing difficulties with Sparkasse. American Bitcoin exchange Kraken and Swedish Safello are said to not be experiencing any issues with Sparkasse, as reported by Cryptoarticles.\n\nNevertheless, similar events had been reported from Germany.

That’s our mission: get more developers building on blockchain technologies; make it a lot easier for them.”\n\nHowever, Neuroware is just one of many API providers in what has become a rather densely populated space.\n\nChain, a San Francisco-based blockchain API provider, recently secured more than $9m in funding to build out its product for developers, and Boost VC-backed BlockCypher is also active, boasting speed and reliability as its platform\'s selling points.\n\nChange of direction\n\nA graduate of 500 Startups, Neuroware was part of the accelerator\'s $100k funding of five bitcoin ventures in 2014.\n\nHowever, at that time, it wasn\'t focused so much on infrastructure. Neuroware was originally working on a brain wallet product at the incubator’s California office, but the company did what the founders called a ""mini-pivot"" – shifting to providing APIs for accessing cryptocurrency blockchains instead.\n\nGiles said:\n\n“Although it was the brain wallet that got us into 500 Startups, our conversations while we were in the accelerator program led us to expand and tackle a slightly bigger problem.”\n\nThe problem Giles is referring to is the tough task of building products using blockchain technology – something the founders experienced firsthand while trying to build the brain wallet.\n\nNeuroware CTO Mark Smalley, who himself has a background as a front-end web developer, began to realize there would be many UI-focused developers needing a platform for easy API access into the blockchain.\n\n“[Bitcoin] is just complicated for the majority of developers,” Smalley said.\n\nNow, with Blockstrap, Neuroware is currently supporting six different blockchains: bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin and their three respective \'testnets\' – the latter allowing for experimentation without actually spending valuable cryptocurrency.\n\n“Because we’re targeting developers, support for testnets is essential,"" said Giles.” If you are experimenting, you don’t want to do it with real money.”\n\nModular focus\n\nNeuroware doesn’t want to limit Blockstrap\'s potential usefulness to the aforementioned cryptocurrencies, however. The company believes that there will be demand for many different blockchains in the future.\n\nGiles pointed out:\n\n“You find the different chains have different personalities. We want to give developers the opportunity to play on each [blockchain].”\n\nBecause of this, Neuroware has built what it calls a \'modular\' platform that will allow developers to work on whatever comes in the future for cryptocurrencies.\n\nEffectively, once a developer has become familiar with using Blockstrap, they will be able to easily operate within its existing framework even as new blockchain-based technologies are adopted in the future.\n\nThis way, developers will already have an understanding of the Blockstrap platform, yet will be able to utilize different types of blockchains – if that’s what the future entails.\n\nSmalley said: “We have to be modular to ensure we’ll be able to adapt for the long-term.”\n\nRipple and Stellar are examples of other platforms that Blockstrap has an interest in integrating with at some point. Whatever developers ultimately will want to utilize, Neuroware wants Blockstrap to provide, and it hopes the modular stack will enable this.\n\nCrowded marketplace\n\nWhat’s interesting about Blockstrap is that not only does it have its own blockchain API, but it also features some neutrality for developers.\n\n“The ecosystem needs a lot of different options and lots of different companies,” Giles noted.\n\nWhile including its own data service on the platform, Blockstrap allows developers to choose from a variety of other blockchain data providers. Currently, it supports the SoChain, Hello! Block and Blockr APIs, although only SoChain can match the six-chain versatility of Blockstrap\'s API.\n\nThe Neuroware founders also offer some value by providing outputs in different ways.\n\nFor example, it uses ISO-standard date formats and gives developers the ability to calculate values using smaller satoshis (each being a 100 millionth of a full unit) or decimal-format numbers (eg 0.00123 BTC).\n\nBy providing something different, the company is hoping to separate itself from the cryptocurrency API pack.\n\nGiles said:\n\n“If you’re just giving access to the blockchain, you’re only solving about half the problem. [It’s] incredibly hard to add value in the space.”\n\nGap in the market\n\nA number of companies in the developer API space see places like Silicon Valley or the entirety of North America as the lucrative market to attract development-focused users.\n\nHowever, Neuroware is currently operating out of Malaysia in hopes of building out distributed payment infrastructure in Southeast Asia, where electronic funds transfer mechanisms are still antiquated.\n\n“There are no payment gateways out here. We don’t have access to Square or Stripe or anything out here [in Asia],” said Smalley.\n\nThe founders conceded that getting developers to use Blockstrap would be their biggest challenge. That said, Neuroware believes developing countries in the Asian market may help to define blockchain technologies.\n\nA refusal to focus solely on bitcoin could also be in the company\'s interests. The recent fervor for \'sidechains\', which builds everything off only the bitcoin blockchain, has created a different atmosphere for cryptocurrency in Western markets.\n\nGiles said:\n\n“We tend to be more opportunistic about the blockchain technologies rather than bitcoin specifically. So, it made sense to support cryptocurrencies that operate in the same way.”\n\nDespite what may come in the debate concerning sidechains versus altcoin blockchains, Neuroware remains convinced that distributed currency-based consumer technologies will require back-end support from systems like Blockstrap.\n\n“We saw a huge hole in the market,” Smalley concluded.\n\nBlockstrap is currently available from its official website or on GitHub.\n\nImages via Neuroware\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The news comes in the midst of the Paycoin controversy that CoinTelegrah covered Friday.\n\n“The community’s response to this issue has developed rapidly over the last few days,” said Moe Levin. “The organizers of the North American Bitcoin Conference remain committed to maintaining a policy of transparency and neutrality in controversial issues.”\n\nLevin’s full announcement reads as follows:\n\n“Our role is not to encourage witch hunts. Our role is not to promote scams. Our role has always been, and will always be, to provide a public forum for intelligent, productive discourse on the issues that matter to the community, however controversial. We intend to provide that public forum next week at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami. We have heard from multitudes of Paycoin supporters, just as we have heard from its detractors. Troublingly, though, we have heard from those – on both sides of the issue – who wish to suppress the open discourse of next week’s forum. They have demanded either that Josh Garza be prohibited from speaking, or that the public be prohibited from responding. These people believe that the public will be somehow duped or entranced by the words of those who disagree with them. Worse, they believe that the North American Bitcoin Conference itself is somehow corrupted by the participation of the other side, that it is somehow less valuable because of it. They believe that only the side they have chosen should be heard – that only their side should be permitted a forum to speak. In short, they believe that the North American Bitcoin Conference should become an echo chamber. That would be unproductive, and it would be unfair to those who will travel thousands of miles to attend. We believe that the value of a forum is not diminished by the participation of different perspectives, the provision of new facts, and the exposition of controversial positions. To the contrary, we believe the value of the conference will be greatly amplified by it. To that end, Josh Garza will have an opportunity to speak, and attendees will have an opportunity to respond.”\n\nFinally, Levin concluded that:\n\n“We will not censor this conference. We ask that you do not censor yourselves. We look forward to seeing you all next week.”\n\nBack in November, Garza and some other GAW team members held discussions where a US$20 price floor for Paycoin (which currently sits at US$3.72 at the time of writing) was proposed but no “guaranteed” via Google Hangouts Q&A session to address curated questions from the community.\n\nOKCoin’s CEO Star Xu also expected\n\nIn other related news, OKCoin, the Beijing based digital currency exchange, announced on January 8 that its CEO, Star Xu, will be making his first speech on US soil at The North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami on January 17.\n\nStar will cover the topic of “The Future of Bitcoin” while also addressing the role of OKcoin as one of the fastest growing exchange platforms offering USD spot exchange and the recently introduced trading tools in an effort to become the market leader.\n\n“Speaking at the conference will offer a unique opportunity to connect with other relevant players in the Bitcoin market,” Star affirms.\n\nAn OKCoin spokesperson also added that “BItcoin is global and so is OKCoin.

The reason put forth by the American embassy in Barbados was that there is not enough evidence to suggest that Ver would leave the US following the event.\n\nVer told CoinDesk that despite having his application rejected numerous times already, officials have refused to review his documentation and other evidence he provided to support his request.\n\nIn response, Ver tweeted the following:\n\nWhile forcing me to pay taxes @USEmbassyBbdos tyrants won't allow me to attend #CES2015, #TNABC or anything in the US pic.twitter.com/8dl6qpPjUM — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) January 6, 2015\n\nTNABC Miami, the Place to Be\n\nThe North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami comes at a crucial time.

Tyler Roye, the CEO of eGifter, has been working hard to bring more and more cards to the digital realm.\n\nAlso read: Interview with Tyler Roye, CEO of eGifter\n\neGifter and eBay\n\nCCN had an opportunity to speak with him about adding eBay.\n\nHow did the deal come about to be able to sell the eBay cards?\n\neBay has been on our list of brands we wanted to add since day one. We kept asking and were contacted in late November by their distributor telling us that we had been approved and would get the card in December. We were very happy to hear the good news.\n\nThe December timing was great as it allowed people to use their Bitcoin for the holidays on eBay or give them away as gifts. The prepaid card industry is huge which Forbes contributor Tom Groenfeldt predicting the industry would bring $200 billion in merchant sales in 2014.\n\nIn 2014, retail purchases made with prepaid cards will top U.S. $200 billion dollars, equaling five percent of all retail spending in the U.S. The purchase volume numbers include prepaid debit, payroll cards, open (from a major card company like Visa V -1.48% or MasterCard MA -1.27% and which can be used anywhere) and closed-loop gift cards (like Starbucks SBUX -3.3%, for example), and open and closed-loop consumer incentive cards.\n\nThe opportunity shows the kind of a growth market that eGifter has positioned itself in with Tyler’s leadership. eGifter keeps expanding offering more and more products.\n\nGetting eBay is a big deal in the electronic gift card for Bitcoin sales world;could you tell me your feelings about it and what we can expect?\n\nWe carry over 200 major brands for bitcoin at this point and add more interesting brands every month, but the eBay card is really an exciting addition. We have started to spread the word and are already seeing a very strong response. Adding great brands like eBay just sends a signal to other brands that they should be considering opening themselves up to cryptocurrencies one way or another. If they are not ready to do it on their own site, then doing it with a digital gift card via eGifter is a great option.\n\nCould you tell CCN how eGifter has been doing these last few months? With BTC value up and down… Have sales still been strong?\n\nSales have really been incredible. We had a very strong holiday, and for January, the sales growth is tracking well above our expectations, even with bitcoin prices dropping. In November, we also became the only company approved by Amazon to sell their eGift card for bitcoin in the UK, France and Germany, and this is growing very rapidly.\n\neGifter Powers Smaller Companies\n\nWhat things do you have in store for eGifter in the near future you can speak about now?\n\nWe have more international expansion coming soon.

We plan to do a lot of this in 2015.\n\nAs we help more smaller companies with their eGift card programs, we intend to educate these companies about the benefit of adding crypto payment options.

Net inflows into the US fund company’s funds surged to $243bn last year, an increase of 61 per cent on the previous record of $151bn the company set in 2013. Bill McNabb, chairman and chief executive of Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, said the company was “firing on all cylinders” and predicted further significant growth for index-based investing. “We did not do anything dramatically different in 2014. This is the culmination of efforts over a number of years. The most important thing for Vanguard is to take care of our clients properly,” he said. Passive funds account for around 35 per cent of all mutual fund assets in the US, compared with just 2 per cent 20 years ago. However, penetration by index trackers in other mutual fund markets is far lower, generally below 10 per cent. This, said Mr McNabb, illustrated the potential for future expansion. Vanguard’s mutual fund structure, which means it is owned by its clients and not shareholders, is unique in the asset management industry. This structure would help Vanguard to keep exerting downward pressure on fees as its assets continue to build, said Mr McNabb. Luke Montgomery, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said: “The Vanguard sales pitch is extremely compelling right now. Their low-cost mantra really resonates with investors. “Active management is going through a very challenging period. Many financial advisers had negative experiences with active managers during the financial crisis and the poor performance of active managers again in 2014 has been widely reported.” In the same way Vanguard led the way in popularising low-cost index-tracking funds for millions of investors, executives at the company’s Pennsylvania headquarters plan to revolutionise the provision of financial advice. ETF industry scales new peaks Play video Vanguard intends to launch a low-cost advice service across the US by the middle of this year. The pilot programme for the new portfolio advice service, which is expected to charge just 0.3 per cent of assets annually compared with an industry average of more than 1 per cent, has attracted 5,000 clients and around $4bn in assets. Growth for Vanguard’s non-US operations accelerated sharply in 2014. Inflows into its international business more than doubled to $28.6bn last year, from $13bn in 2013. Vanguard, which launched its first European-listed ETFs as recently as 2012, became the second-fastest growing ETF provider in Europe last year behind BlackRock. “Wherever Vanguard appears, it changes the landscape,” said Detlef Glow, head of European research at Lipper, the data provider. Outside the US, Vanguard is prioritising the UK and Australia for growth. Reforms in the UK pensions market, including the ending of compulsory annuitisation, have provided a catalyst for further changes, said Mr McNabb. Observers believe this signals that Vanguard will make a push into the UK defined contribution pensions market in 2015 as it is already the largest provider of 401(k) pension plans in the US, where it has experienced strong demand for its target-date retirement funds, particularly among younger investors. In Australia, Vanguard plans “further sizeable investments” to meet the needs of the country’s sophisticated pensions market. It is also studying developments in China’s retirement market “very hard”, according to Mr McNabb. Vanguard is further considering selling directly to investors in Europe, as it already does in the US. Currently, its European-listed funds are distributed via financial advisers and third-party platform providers. Such a platform would require a substantial initial investment and a conviction that suitably high sales could be achieved. “Stay tuned,” said Mr McNabb.', 'Chris Newlands JANUARY 11, 2015 0 Threadneedle Investments is to be renamed Columbia Threadneedle Investments as the 20-year-old City fund manager merges its investment capabilities with US sister company Columbia Management. Threadneedle, named after Threadneedle Street in London, the home of the Bank of England, will be rebranded during the first half of this year to coincide with a move to new headquarters at Cannon Place. Together, Threadneedle and Columbia, which Threadneedle’s parent company, Ameriprise Financial, acquired from Bank of America in 2009, will become the world’s 30th-largest asset manager, with combined assets of $505bn. “This is a very good yin and yang merger for us,” said Campbell Fleming, chief executive of Threadneedle, who will become chief operating officer of the combined business. “There is very little overlap between the two firms — it is going to be a powerful combination.” Mr Fleming stressed that no jobs would be lost as a result of the rebrand and the legal and regulated company structures of Threadneedle and Columbia, which manages $358bn of the combined assets, would not change. “We have been telegraphing this change to staff for some time and there has been real excitement about the launch of a new brand,” he said. The new entity will employ more than 2,000 staff. Ted Truscott, chief executive for global asset management at Ameriprise Financial, added: “We are introducing the Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand to reflect the significant resources and expertise available to our teams around the globe. “By working together we add depth to our offerings, enabling us to make better investment decisions and ultimately generate better performance for our clients.” Threadneedle, currently based at St Mary Axe next to the Gherkin, instructed property adviser CBRE to search for new offices at the end of June last year. Its new headquarters at Cannon Place will also house fellow asset manager Franklin Templeton Investments.

01/11/2015,"['A huge aircraft hangar in Boden, in northern Sweden, big enough to hold a dozen helicopters, is now packed with computers--45,000 of them, each with a whirring fan to stop it overheating.\n\nThe machines work ceaselessly, trying to solve fiendishly difficult mathematical puzzles.\n\nThe solutions are, in themselves, unimportant. Yet by solving the puzzles, the computers earn their owners a reward in bitcoin, a digital ""crypto-currency"".\n\nThe machines in Boden are in competition with hundreds of thousands more worldwide. The first to solve a puzzle earns 25 bitcoins, currently worth $6,900. Since bitcoin\'s invention in 2008 by a mysterious figure calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto, people have increasingly traded it for real money, albeit at a wildly varying price (see chart).\n\nAlthough there are only $3.8 billion-worth of them in circulation--about twice the value of Paraguayan guaraníes in use--bitcoins have three useful qualities in a currency: they are hard to earn, limited in supply and easy to verify.\n\nBut stability is important too: just over a year ago a bitcoin was worth four times as many dollars as now. But then Mt Gox, the crypto-currency\'s biggest exchange, collapsed and the bitcoin bubble burst.\n\nCritics make comparisons with 17th-century ""tulip mania"", and predict that bitcoin mania will fizzle out in similar fashion. On January 5th Bitstamp, another bitcoin exchange, halted operations and reported that 19,000 of the currency units had vanished in an apparent hacking attack.\n\nThe price collapse and the exchanges\' woes do not tell the whole story, though: increasing numbers of businesses are accepting payment in bitcoin, including Time Inc and Microsoft; and whatever the fate of bitcoin, the technology may spawn a range of alternative crypto-currencies and provide the basis for other businesses involving such things as the transfer of assets.\n\nWhen Mr Nakamoto announced his invention (but not his true identity, see book reviews, ""Bitcoin: Much more than digital cash""), several digital-cash schemes, including DigiCash and e-gold, had failed, or were in their death throes. But whereas some had tried to create the electronic equivalents of bills and coins, bitcoins only exist as entries in a giant electronic ledger called the ""blockchain"".\n\nThis contains the history of every transaction in the coin, and copies of it are held on many computers around the world. What this means is that unlike conventional currencies and earlier digital ones, bitcoins do not need trusted third parties to handle flows of money or a ""central bank"" to issue it.\n\nThe computers that solve the puzzles also process transactions in the currency and update the blockchain. Every ten minutes each machine or group of machines takes a block of pending transactions, and uses it as the input for a mathematical puzzle. The first to find a solution announces it to the rest, which check that it is right, and that the transactions are valid. If a majority approve, the block is cryptographically attached to the ledger and the computers move on to a new set of transactions.\n\nIf a fraudster wanted to spend a bitcoin twice, he would need to disguise it by rewriting the ledger. To do this he would single-handedly have to control more than half of the network\'s computing capacity. But such a ""51% attack"" would be prohibitively expensive: Coinometrics, a data provider, reckons it would cost $425m in equipment and electricity.\n\nThe enigmatic Mr Nakamoto designed the system to keep everybody honest.\n\nFor instance, successful miners have to wait for a further 99 blocks of transactions to be processed before they get their rewards--so there is a constantly refreshed pool of participants with an interest in ensuring that everyone else keeps to the rules.\n\nThe system of rewarding successful miners with bitcoin has proved an effective way to get the currency into circulation.\n\nOperators of conventional payment systems live on transaction fees, but that business model would not have worked for bitcoin in its early days, because of a lack of users.\n\nHowever, as bitcoin becomes more popular, the idea is that miners will be able to start charging significant transaction fees, and that these will become their main source of income. It will need to: the system cuts the reward for solving puzzles every four years or so.\n\nDespite the slump in bitcoin\'s value--last year it performed even worse than the Russian rouble and Ukrainian hryvnia--the combined mining power on the network is still increasing, and some miners are still investing in upgrading their machines, making this one of the fastest-moving parts of the IT industry.\n\nBrew your own money\n\nIn the crypto-currency\'s early days, most miners were small-scale, trying to mint money on their home computers. This was Mr Nakamoto\'s libertarian dream: home-brewed money, without the need for central authorities. But as bitcoin\'s value rose, it all became more businesslike. Individual miners started to combine their computing power and share the rewards. Most mining today is provided through such ""pools"".\n\nStartups from all over the world began building specialised hardware powered by custom-built chips, known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Leaving the amateurs behind, these firms soon became locked in a digital arms race. Microprocessors usually double their power every 18 months, a rhythm called Moore\'s law. In the case of mining ASICs, this doubling has occurred every six months.\n\nMining has also moved into the cloud. Firms have started selling online mining capacity in ""gigahashes per second"", or Gh/s--that is, for a fee they will provide enough computing power to make one billion attempts a second to solve a ""hash function"", as the puzzles are called. For instance, Genesis Mining charges $702 for 1,000 Gh/s plus a small fee for electricity.\n\nGiven the nature of the business, one would expect the bosses of bitcoin-mining firms to be super-geeks. But instead of coming from Silicon Valley, they typically hail from places like Sweden and Georgia--and talk (and often look) more like real miners. ""I\'m no libertarian but a businessman,"" says Sam Cole, the ""C"" in KnCMiner, the operator of the giant mining facility in Boden and a maker of mining computers.\n\nLike other energy-intensive industries such as smelting aluminium, minting bitcoins is more efficiently done at scale, and in places where electricity is cheap and reliable.\n\nIt also helps to be somewhere cold, to reduce the cost of cooling the machines. KnCMiner\'s hangar is near the Arctic Circle and right next to a hydroelectric dam.\n\nThe makers of mining computers benefit from the way the bitcoin system adjusts the difficulty of the puzzles, every two weeks, according to how much computing power is hooked up to the system.\n\nIn theory the difficulty can be adjusted in both directions: upwards, to ensure that the system does not get swamped by an excess of prize-seeking machines; and downwards, to encourage miners to keep their machines online when things get too quiet.\n\nBut until now the difficulty has mostly gone upwards: since the first ASIC chips were introduced in early 2013, it has increased by a factor of 10,000. As a result, new mining computers, which each cost several thousand dollars, have been becoming obsolete in a matter of months.\n\nWhen the bitcoin price was rising, many of its fans thought investing in mining equipment was a better bet than simply buying and holding the currency. They were willing to plunk down top dollar months ahead of delivery of the computers. These advance payments allowed KnCMiner and other makers to manage without having to raise any financing.\n\nWhat happens in the wake of the bitcoin price collapse is unclear. The long queues for mining rigs have dispersed. Demand for renting cloud-based hashing-power is stagnant.\n\nMany equipment-makers have ended up running the machines for their own benefit--and selling some of their stock of bitcoins to cover costs. Some people say this is why the currency has kept falling.\n\nPeople in the industry are already discussing at what price mining becomes unprofitable. But Mr Cole is unfazed. Where others see a weak price, he just sees all the bitcoin yet to be mined, and lots of struggling rivals set to exit the business.\n\nHe recently raised $14m in venture capital, looking forward to a bigger slice of a less competitive market. If other miners do give up, the difficulty of the puzzles may fall--so winning bitcoins would get easier.\n\nPerhaps it is a good thing that the breakneck growth of a year ago has ended: had it continued, the system would soon have hit the limits of its capacity. The bitcoin protocol in its current form can only process seven transactions per second--nothing compared with the capacity of conventional payment systems such as Visa, which can handle 10,000.\n\nNot very green\n\nA more fundamental worry is that digital-currency mining, like other sorts of mining, has environmental costs: all that number-crunching uses a lot of electricity, and not all of it comes from renewable sources, as it does in Boden.\n\nThe rapid development of the ASICs chips has made the machines more efficient, but even if all mining worldwide were carried out in modern facilities like Boden\'s, the combined electricity consumption would be 1.46 terawatt-hours per year--the consumption of about 135,000 average American homes.\n\nA bigger concern is that, as the mining pools have got bigger, it no longer seems inconceivable that a bunch of miners might amass enough capacity to dominate the system and become capable of mounting a 51% attack. Last June one pool, GHash.IO, had the bitcoin community running scared by briefly touching that level, before some users switched to other pools.\n\nSuch is the complexity of the system that some analysts wonder if it might be possible for a rogue pool to launch an attack with a much smaller share. And the truth is that no one is sure how concentrated the industry already is. About a fifth of mining power is classified as ""unknown"", meaning it is not clear who owns it.\n\nChances are that many of these mystery machines live in China. At any rate, mining is likely to grow rapidly there. Miners in Inner Mongolia--where electricity is cheap thanks to abundant coal, over-investment in power plants and lax environmental rules--are reportedly building data centres much bigger than any in the West.\n\n""I\'ve always feared that mining will concentrate in a few countries,"" says Yifu Guo, a founder of Avalon, a designer of mining chips. He even worries that a hostile government might seize control of the bitcoin system. Others worry that it might, at least, end up as a monopoly.\n\nWhether the bitcoin system can avoid such outcomes will depend on whether its participants can agree on reforms to stop it becoming too concentrated. However, it may have become too successful for its own good: when billions are at stake, vested interests tend to defend the status quo.\n\nAs with the internet, the governance of bitcoin follows the principle of ""rough consensus and running code"". Everybody can pitch in on online forums. If there is general agreement and the solution has proved workable, the system\'s software code is updated by one of its five main developers--who ""emerged"" as pre-eminent figures during bitcoin\'s early days.\n\nThen follows the real test: whether miners accept the changes. They ""vote"" in favour of a software update by installing it on their machines. And it only becomes part of the system if a large majority do so. That has not been a problem so far. But miners may still balk at any future changes they fear could cost them money.\n\nGavin Andresen, one of the five main developers, is optimistic this can be avoided. If miners did block better solutions, there would be a ""fork"", meaning that a part of the bitcoin community would start a new currency.\n\nSome groups have already launched their own crypto-currencies. Many of these ""altcoins"" are the bitcoin equivalent of stock markets\' highly speculative ""penny stocks"". But some offer real innovation: Ripple and Stellar do away with mining altogether and use other mechanisms, such as voting, to create the currency and update the blockchain.\n\nNow there is much talk about ""side-chains"", new blockchains pegged to that of bitcoin in such a way that the currency and other assets can be transferred between them, which could unleash even more experimentation.\n\nOther groups are using the blockchain in ways Mr Nakamoto never intended. Some, such as CoinSpark, are offering services to transact in any asset over the network, including stocks and bonds, or use it for notarized messaging (by embedding the location and a summary of the message in a bitcoin transaction).\n\nWhere all this may lead to is a constellation of linked crypto-currencies and blockchains, with all sorts of uses: stores of value, means of exchange, mechanisms for transferring assets and verifying transactions, whatever. The original bitcoin may remain at the centre of this constellation--or not.\n\nWhether its price recovers from last year\'s slump may not matter. Whoever and wherever he is, Mr Nakamoto can be proud of having unleashed a wave of financial innovation, and founded what looks set to become a sizeable new branch of the global IT industry.\n\nClick here to subscribe to The Economist\n\nThis article was from The Economist and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.', 'One of the most convenient, non-technical ways to get involved in Bitcoin is to simply buy some with fiat money. Larger exchanges allow for this but then there are also a number of places online where this process is streamlined. CashCoin.io was one such place until very recently when they abruptly put up a notice:\n\nThank you for being a CashCoin customer. We have decided to suspend selling bitcoins indefinitely and are focusing instead on building applications such as cross border remittances on top of the block chain technology.\n\nAlso read: Taiwanese Can Now Buy Bitcoin at over 5000 Convenience Stores, Including Hi-Life and OK Mart\n\nWhat Does it Do?\n\nBuilding cross-border remittances on top of the block chain technology. Sounds cool, but what does it mean?\n\nAs far as we can tell right now, it appears to be a fee-less means of transferring money designed specifically for migrant workers, manifesting itself in an app called Zed. Rather than charge fees, the ZipZap team (formerly of CashCoin.io) will make money by pooling funds for the best foreign exchange rates. What that means for the consumer is that the desired amount of money will make it to the destination while ZipZap will profit when the right swaps are made at the right times using the funds being transferred. While they might only make a few pennies off any one individual’s transfer, they’ll make larger sums off the larger amounts they’re moving, all without costing the consumer anything.\n\nUsing the digital currency platform as well as traditional payment rails, Zed will automatically find the most efficient way to move funds instantaneously around the globe, at no costs and at very low currency conversion rates.\n\nThe market for a product like this is vast, with Western Union, MoneyGram, and the like being the traditional options, especially for folks not versed in technologies like Bitcoin or PayPal. According to the available information, transfers will be instant. Sometimes traditional payment networks will be used and other times digital currency platforms will be utilized.\n\nSupposing this app delivers on its promises and manages to stay legal in all the places it intends to operate, Zed could easily become the killer financial app of 2015.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Getting those tax records together for the 2015 filing season? Don\'t forget about Bitcoin.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance to taxpayers in 2014 on how to treat Bitcoin – and other virtual currency – for federal income tax purposes. That guidance, IRS Notice 2014-21, (downloads as a pdf) indicates that Bitcoin and other ""convertible"" virtual currencies are to be treated as a capital asset. ""Convertible"" virtual currencies are generally defined as virtual currencies with an equivalent value in real currency or those that act like a substitute for real currency.\n\nFor taxpayers, this means that Bitcoin and other similar virtual currency will be subject to capital gains rules for any applicable gains or losses. That treatment does have an upside for taxpayers since capital gains rates are generally pretty favorable to taxpayers. For 2014, capital gains rates for long term gains (those held more than a year) is no higher than 15% for most taxpayers (20% for those with taxable income at or above $406,750 for individual taxpayers; $457,600 for married taxpayers filing jointly or qualifying widow(er); $432,200 for head of household, and $228,800 for married taxpayers filing separately).\n\nAnd losses are really losses: capital losses can be netted against capital gains and excess losses can be deducted from ordinary income (up to $3,000 each year).\n\nFor those buying and selling Bitcoin as an investment, calculating gains and losses are figured the same as buying and selling stock. For those treating Bitcoin like cash – from paying for services to shopping for patio furniture on Overstock.com – individual transactions may result in gains or losses: while the triggering event (the transaction) is easily determined, it may be difficult to figure cost basis – or the holding period - so you may need to do a little bit of digging in your records.\n\nAnd don\'t assume that using Bitcoin to pay for services changes the playing field: normal reporting rules related to bartering, independent contractors and self-employment tax still apply whether you’re paid in virtual currency or cash. This is of particular importance to those who ""mine"" virtual currency as a trade or business (as compared to an employee); the net earnings from self-employment resulting from those business activities are considered self-employment income and are subject to the self-employment tax.\n\nFor purposes of issuing information reports like forms W-2 or forms 1099, the normal reporting rules also apply. Payments of virtual currency required to be reported on a form 1099- MISC or similar should be reported using the fair market value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date of payment.\n\nBitcoin has been around for a few years now. This guidance is admittedly late in coming. As a result, the IRS also made it clear that prior reporting inconsistent with this guidance may be eligible for penalty relief. If you\'ve reported Bitcoin on a prior year tax return using a different position, be sure to check with your tax preparer about your options.\n\nAnd don\'t forget about those FBARs: while FBAR reporting is still a few months away (those are due in June, not with your return filed in April), you don\'t have to scramble to get extra documents together. For now, the IRS has taken the position that ""The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which issues regulatory guidance pertaining to Reports of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBARs), is not requiring that digital (or virtual) currency accounts be reported on an FBAR at this time but may consider requiring such accounts to be reported in the future. No additional guidance is available at this time.""', ""Calling Reddit a community is a bit like calling Los Angeles a community. It is actually a network of countless sub-communities (conveniently called 'subreddits') held together by an absolute respect for anonymity, free speech and the democratic process.\n\nIf you post what you want, upvote what you like and downvote what you don't like, what will emerge is an aggregate of what the community finds valuable. That's the idea, anyway.\n\nReddit's radical libertarianism works quite well in bringing together large groups of people with niche interests to experiment with new ideas. Redditors can hash out novel concepts well before the mainstream media has had the time or the incentive to formulate a uniform take.\n\nIn particular, in the last few years, Reddit has lit up with discussion and controversy surrounding new digital currencies.\n\nIts largest subreddit dedicated to cryptocurrency, r/bitcoin, was a vital part of the bitcoin scene well before the cryptocurrency inspired widespread public fascination.\n\nAnyone can post or comment on /r/bitcoin, but a few recognizable stock characters often dominate the conversation.\n\nHere are the five most common cryptocurrency caricatures you'll meet wandering the pages of r/bitcoin.\n\n1. The Booster\n\nIt takes a certain degree of enthusiasm to invest time, for free, in sharing knowledge, ideas, and jokes on Reddit. Needless to say, /r/bitcoin draws a disproportionate number of active members who are really, really psyched about bitcoin.\n\nWhile the Booster has played an important role in publicizing bitcoin and encouraging its use and development, he can sometimes be more than a tad embarrassing.\n\nFor example, witness the people who thought the Silk Road bust and the collapse of the Russian Ruble were good news for bitcoin. Or the guy who got banned from his favorite Chinese restaurant for trying to tip in bitcoin, behaving like a violent jackass when it wasn't accepted, and bragging about it.\n\n2. The Early Investor\n\nIt's easy to mistake the Early Investor for the Booster, and it's important to examine all posts closely and maintain a healthy skepticism about their underlying motives.\n\nLike the Booster, the Early Investor sank a lot of time and money into bitcoin before it was cool. But the Early Investor sometimes has more cynical motives for pumping everyone's enthusiasm.\n\nSince bitcoin is a deflationary currency that rewards early adopters over latecomers, it is in the Early Investor's interest to encourage ongoing risk. Early Investors will drive up bitcoin's price to dangerous levels in hopes of cashing out at newcomers' expense.\n\n3. 'John Galt'\n\nWhen bitcoin is in crisis, such as it was after the collapse of Mt Gox, a 'John Galt' will check in with a pompous pep talk. A John Galt is often a worried Early Investor or a cozy VC who can sustain a loss that might cripple less well-padded users. Or he may just be a random dude who enjoys speaking in lofty, imminently mockable proclamations. The nickname is likely a reference to a character in Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged.\n\n4. The Altcoiner\n\nWhile bitcoin alternatives such as litecoin and dogecoin have their own tightly knit communities on Reddit, sometimes altcoiners check in at /r/bitcoin to see what's going on.\n\nMany /r/bitcoin denizens harbor a disproportionate animus for altcoins, particularly dogecoin. This can lead to dark comedy when, for instance, a dogecoiner finds a recently washed-out former bitcoin millionaire and offers a doge tip, the equivalent of tossing pennies.\n\nDogecoin was largely satirical from the get-go, and its adherents derive a lot of laughs from their feud with bitcoin. Light tussles can escalate quickly when Boosters take dogecoin as an existential threat and leap into comedy quicksand. A lot of dogecoin's inside jokes have taken on added life in /r/bitcoin. If you were wondering what the deal is with the 'To the Moon!' guy, there you go.\n\n5. The Troll\n\nThere is some overlap here with the Altcoiners, but the most adamant /r/bitcoin trolls have no faith in bitcoin as a currency or an investment, and consider it their moral mission to debunk the hype surrounding it.\n\nThey get a lot of traction because Boosters, Early Investors, and particularly John Galts fall so easily into their negativity traps. More level-headed /r/bitcoin users often waste hours and hours explaining to them, again and again, that their community's most over-the-top elements are more visible than they are influential.\n\nThe only way to get much out of the valuable ideas and discussion on /r/bitcoin is to maintain a strict don't-feed-the-trolls policy.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, CoinDesk.\n\nComputer users image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Speaking to CoinDesk he said he decided to go all-in on bitcoin and blockchain tech in order to disrupt what he considers outdated business transaction systems.\n\nForzley explained:\n\n“The interesting thing about the blockchain is its ability to essentially outsource payment processing to endpoints – removing intermediaries.”\n\nThe idea\n\nThe intermediaries Forzley plans to bypass are the arguably complex tangle of banks that international fiat payments are currently forced go through when crossing borders.\n\nPreviously, Forzley founded a company called eBillme, an alternative payment method that plugged into shopping carts and connected directly with users' online bank accounts.\n\nThe firm boasted Sears, Buy.com and Tiger Direct as customers, and was sold to Western Union in 2011.\n\nForzley said that in his ample time studying payment networks, he kept coming back to one realization: the banking system was highly antiquated.\n\n“These systems are very domestic in their construction, designed pre-Internet,” he said.\n\nFor example, SWIFT, a payment order network used by banks across the world, is one of the systems that today powers the global payments system.\n\nForzley believes that payments don’t necessarily have to be beholden to SWIFT, though, that they can use newer technologies. “These systems can be tied together through a different protocol called the blockchain,” he said.\n\nForzley added:\n\n“The reason why [Align Commerce uses] the blockchain is, if you look at flows of funds around the world, the most difficult transactions, the most expensive with the most friction, are basically cross-border transactions.“\n\nBitcoin as a container\n\nWhat Align Commerce is doing can be compared to a shipping container that moves goods from different countries – point A to point B.\n\n“It’s a container that has value,” explained Forzley.\n\nFor example, a payment sender can have US dollars at point A and a euro receiver at point B. To facilitate this type of transaction, Align Commerce uses bitcoin in the middle of the transaction as the container.\n\nForzley added:\n\n“We are using the blockchain as a way to carry the transaction. This transaction would have gone through correspondent banks; this is a simpler way to carry the transaction from the sender to the receiver.”\n\nReal-world benefits\n\nThis concept improves over existing models used for cross-border payments in terms of higher transparency and efficiency, Forzley argues.\n\n“[Payments] end up being recorded as transactions on the blockchain. You’ll see [Align Commerce transactions] just like any other transaction,” he said.\n\nThe Align Commerce system, in essence, requires the use of bitcoin exchanges with liquidity to move various denominations of fiat. Along with improved transparency, Align Commerce believes bitcoin is a faster and more efficient method of moving money because it avoids the complex foreign exchange currency market.\n\n“We work with all the [bitcoin] exchanges in the market that have volume. [The] transaction comes in, it hits our account. We then move it to the exchange, convert, move, convert again,” Forzely said.\n\nAlign Commerce was part of the Boost VC Tribe 5 group of startups, and already has a number of investors backing its ideas, including the Bitcoin Opportunity Corp.\n\nIn addition, Align Commerce already has customers, according to Forzely:\n\n“We have accountants, lawyers and exporters and importers. Different e-commerce merchants. These are all different markets.“\n\nRegulation and overall cost\n\nAlign Commerce clearly depends on bitcoin wallets, exchanges and blockchain API companies in order to operate, but it largely avoids the existing payments system – meaning a reliance on the still-nascent bitcoin economy\n\nSo, the question remains, at a time when Western Union indicates its service is expensive because of regulation in regular payments, how will Align Commerce deal with that issue when it ultimately comes to bitcoin?\n\n“There will be regulation,” Forzley said. “You will need to run know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulation. You need to run risk management and you need to have a business and you need to make money.”\n\nAlign Commerce’s strategy centers on providing expedited service and improved tracking ability compared to what banks offer right now. The company is steadfast in its resolve that the blockchain will help it compete in cross-border payments, even if increased regulation means higher expenses.\n\nForzley said:\n\n“When all these [regulatory] costs pile up, they will add up. Despite all this I do still think you can operate at a cost structure that is more efficient than what exists today.”\n\nAs a result, the issue of payments-based regulatory compliance is not going to disappear just because of cryptocurrency's emergence.\n\nStill, Forzley believes Align Commerce will be able to obtain customers looking for payments solutions with the bitcoin and blockchain value-add of global transparency and efficiency.\n\nSell global, get paid local\n\nWith his previous company, Forzley was able to add online banking to e-commerce shopping carts. But, what about implementing that concept globally?\n\nAlong with business-to-business payment invoicing, Align Commerce is executing on that idea with a product called Payinlocal.\n\nUsing the aforementioned bitcoin container concept, Payinlocal allows an e-commerce merchant the ability to accept many different types of currency.\n\nAccepting electronic payments is one of the biggest problems businesses have in some regions. This is especially true in places where credit cards or other digital payment solutions are not very good options.\n\nForzely said:\n\n“Payments are a difficult thing to do if you’re growing your business and you need to collect money from around the world.”\n\nWith Payinlocal, Align Commerce allows an e-commerce site to receive local currency as payment. By using bitcoin as a transport method, these payments can be completed even if customers are located across the globe – and using a completely different currency.\n\nIn essence, Payinlocal allows ecommerce businesses worldwide access to potential customers. In the end, this is all possible because of the borderless potential of using bitcoin as container and its blockchain technology as a device for tracking.\n\nAlign Commerce is currently operating in a private beta.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

You instead cut out the tumor.”\n\nCoinTelegraph: We can start with your new project, Medici. How have Wall Street traders and executives reacted regarding your plans to build a crypto-security application? Has it been positive or negative overall?\n\nPatrick Byrne: Well, first of all, we must understand that any of these crypto-security conventions that you attend, there are a lot of spies there, sent by the banks. They identify themselves as working for one company or another, and say that their job is keeping track of the crypto revolution. They understand that this is going to be extraordinarily disruptive. Generally, these people are nice to me. But there are people who get how disruptive this is.\n\nThe banks, regulators—in particular, people from the CTFC— understand that an industry that has done things the same way for between 150 and 800 years might not be able to cope with crypto, which changes all of that. Actually, I would have thought that they would be less hospitable, but the truth is that they seem to be bending over backwards to be nice to me. Maybe they understand that we are good guys to be nice to at this point.\n\nCT: Will Medici only be working with Counterparty?\n\nPB: No. There are two different projects. Medici is one product, and Counterparty is a different set of developers. They are not tied together, although they will have certain shared relationships.\n\nCT: What and when is the first deliverable for Medici?\n\nPB: The technology platform that would allow us to issue a crypto-security and have our own crypto-coin, we can finish in Q1 [first quarter], but then we have to convince the government to allow us to issue it. It is difficult to say how long this might take, but so far the regulators have been open. They have made it clear that they see that this is a revolution coming, and only want to see it develop in a proper way.\n\n“Generally we want to trade with each other and treat each other on a fair basis. But there are those who would abuse the system, find loopholes to take advantage of others. My goal is to destroy those institutions that these people use for cover.”\n\nCT: It seems to be a common misconception in the Bitcoin community that regulators are “out to get us.” The regulators seem to think that everyone in the Bitcoin community is adverse to any regulation. What we have is two sides of the same coin not being willing to flip over.\n\nPB: Well, I am not totally sympathetic with that idea. Personally, I think that some of the institutions that we now have need to be ended. I think most humans are the same, but not all. There is a class among us that can best be described as “predators.” Generally we want to trade with each other and treat each other on a fair basis. But there are those who would abuse the system, find loopholes to take advantage of others. My goal is to destroy those institutions that these people use for cover.\n\n“The current system is filled with people who have figured out how to gain things without adding any value to society, driving Porsches that are paid for with other people’s savings. This has been building for a long time, and it is why I get so excited about crypto.”\n\nCT: Can you tell us what those institutions are, and what experiences did you have that made you decide that you had to do something about this?\n\nPB: Well, Wall Street has predatory institutions, and ultimately the Central Bank is predatory, and as Thomas Sowell said a couple of years ago, “It is a cancer on America.” When asked what we replace it with, he said that you do not replace cancer. You instead cut out the tumor. I also think that the DTCC, the central party clearing system on Wall Street, at least structured as it is now, is inherently predatory. The settlement system for the stock market is another example. It was built to allow fault tolerance. This is good, but unfortunately predators have figured out how to use fault tolerance loopholes to rig the market. This does not happen on the whole market. What they do is rig the apparent supply to affect prices.\n\nThe problem is that most people do not connect the loopholes to the scams. I made a statement to a Columbia class back in 2005 that was used by Fortune Magazine to try to make me look crazy. I said, “There are grandmothers eating dog food for dinner so that some asshole on Wall Street can drive a Porsche.” That was in 2005, and over the last decade we can see that what I described back then is actually happening today. The current system is filled with people who have figured out how to gain things without adding any value to society, driving Porsches that are paid for with other people’s savings. This has been building for a long time, and it is why I get so excited about crypto.\n\nCT: Will your platform support trading of all US stocks and ETFs, or a subset?\n\nPB: I believe that we will be a national market system compliant and able to trade everything.\n\nCT: How is the process of price discovery going to work? In other words, how will the platform integrate with legacy trading environments?\n\nPB: I do not want to give too much away, but it will be fully integrated with legacy platforms and wired into the national market systems.\n\n“This technology is so overwhelming, so disruptive, that we tend to think that everyone is sitting there plotting on how to stop it.”\n\nCT: What are some lessons at this point in the project with respect to technology issues and interactions with regulators that you have learned and that other people can grow from?\n\nPB: This technology is so overwhelming, so disruptive, that we tend to think that everyone is sitting there plotting on how to stop it. Maybe some are, but there are also many who are thinking about how to get on top of this before it disrupts us. Basically, these people do not want to be the “buggy whip manufacturer,” putting all of their effort into stopping something and falling behind, when the smarter move would be to think about how to start making auto parts instead of buggy whips.\n\nCT: Where are the biggest pain points that these predatory people attack, who is the most vulnerable, and how do we protect them?\n\nPB: There are a lot of people doing startups with a crowdfunding model that looks really close to issuing a security. Doing that is basically giving yourself as a hostage to fortune. The reason is that you can get halfway into your funding and here comes the SEC to shut you down over some obscure definition of a security as compared to a coin. Doing anything that is not KYC [Know Your Customer] compliant will also bring federal agencies down on you before long. There are a lot of companies that, while they probably had no ill intent, went down because of problems like this.\n\nCT: One of the things we are in dire need of is regulatory clarity. There is a large disparity between what we have with Bitcoin and these legacy systems. How can these grandmothers who are losing their savings be protected from the predators who are still using these old systems? Can we build a solution within the crypto system?\n\nPB: Those people can be helped by having a crypto version of the stock market, removing the need for a centralized settlement system. This will be a big idea in the developing world because it would open the door for a land-titling system. There is an economist from Peru named Hernando de Soto who argued for a valid land-titling system. He used Haiti as an example. In that country it takes 36 years to get your land titled. This essentially means that people cannot approve their land, and banks will not give loans without clear titles. If we build a land-titling system in crypto, it will dramatically speed this process up and change the world by allowing capital to flow more freely.\n\nOne of the things we are doing is building a “crypto incubator.” We are hiring developers and crypto experts to come up with new ideas on how crypto can be used to improve the way we live and do business. We are going to have quite a crypto team here over the next few months.\n\nCT: Do you think Overstock.com and other e-commerce giants are going to be affected by projects like Open Bazaar?\n\nPB: I really do not think it will affect Overstock. There are a lot of things that we do, such as advertising and warehousing, that go far beyond building a financial transaction system. They do have an interesting project though.\n\n“The day will come when [Bitcoin] will be a major source of revenue, when people will be looking for a place to buy coffee with bitcoin.”\n\nCT: Do you have any recommendations to business owners who are considering accepting Bitcoin?\n\nPB: Bitcoin is easy to integrate and it will generate more revenue. It may not rock your sails now, but the day will come when it will be a major source of revenue, when people will be looking for a place to buy coffee with bitcoin.\n\nCT: You are known as a person who thinks outside the box. Where are the areas that you would consider yourself more of a traditional thinker?\n\nPB: Well, I think in terms of ethical obligations to my shareholders. I think of myself as working for 6,000 little old widows and orphans who have given me their capital, their life savings, and they are asking me every day, “What have you done with my money?”\n\nCT: Have you experienced any backlash from either your customers or shareholders over your acceptance of Bitcoin?\n\nPB: No, not at all. Actually the shareholders are grateful for the worldwide publicity that we have received.\n\n“I started out in online sales in 1999, and we had a sense back then that we were doing something as revolutionary as the people who were printing the Gutenberg Bible were. I get that same feeling when I think about Bitcoin and crypto.”\n\nCT: What percentages of purchases are made in bitcoin on a daily basis?\n\nPB: It’s still less than one tenth of one percent. It has been going up, but it is hard to separate which part comes from publicity and which part comes from the Christmas season. I started out in online sales in 1999, and we had a sense back then that we were doing something as revolutionary as the people who were printing the Gutenberg Bible were. I get that same feeling when I think about Bitcoin and crypto. I suspect that this will be as great a revolution as the internet was when it began.\n\n[Q&A by Toni Lane Casserly, written by Carlo Caraluzzo.]\n\nDid you enjoy this article? You may also be interested in reading these ones:', 'The past 12 months have seen a veritable explosion in the number of alternative digital currencies, otherwise known as altcoins.\n\nThe numbers for exactly how many altcoins are in existence vary depending on the measure. CoinMarketCap.com lists 554 cryptocurrencies at the time of writing – up from around 67 a year ago.\n\nAccording to some estimates, however, thousands of altcoins have seen some level of circulation since the bitcoin protocol first became available for use and adaptation.\n\nMany altcoins set out with legitimate uses, strong communities and active development teams. Some have descended into parody, with collapsed values and eerily quiet forum pages. Yet others were heavily pre-mined scams, or joke coins that never seriously aimed to have a real future as a digital currency.\n\nOne could argue which altcoin is the most innovative, the most noteworthy or the most notorious of 2014 until you were blue in the face. And many altcoin fans love to do just that. It\'s perhaps more fun, though, to take a look at some of the more unusual coins we encountered in the past 12 months.\n\nIn that spirit, here are some of the weirdest altcoins that appeared in 2014.\n\nGoldenloaf\n\nWhen the Ukrainian government led by Viktor Yanukovich collapsed in February, the presidential palace Yanukovich resided in at the time was seized by protestors and its contents made known to the world.\n\nThose who took over the grounds quickly found that the now-ex president possessed a vast collection of antique cars, crystal-encrusted chandeliers, incriminating documents and a full-size replica Spanish galleon.\n\nWhat they also found was a 2kg piece of gold shaped like a loaf of bread, an object that briefly became the focus of media attention and speculation.\n\nSome months later, the now-infamous golden loaf served as the inspiration for the aptly named goldenloaf (sign: GLY) altcoin, which also circulated under the name goldenloafyanukovichcoin.\n\nAs explained in the alt’s Bitcoin Talk thread, GLY ostensibly tied its value to the loaf’s weight of 2 kilograms of gold.\n\nSome of the replies in the thread dismissed the project as a scam, and later posts suggest that those concerns were valid. GLY saw a brief period of trading activity mid-summer before the price crashed at the end of August. The thread hasn’t been updated since September.\n\nRobot Sex Nickels\n\nWhat’s in a name? For robot sex nickels (RSN), the name implies just about everything you need to know about this altcoin.\n\nWith a self-described “bouncy bouncy coin distribution” and a 600-year mining cycle, robotsexnickels had all the trappings of a coin built to be strange.\n\nAs the project’s Bitcoin Talk thread explained:\n\n“Robot Sex Nickels is a secure anonymous cryptocurrency with a primary purpose of providing slick lubrication for frisky robot jiggy-jiggy. There is a 1% premine to cover bounties and web hosting costs. No humans.”\n\nRSN saw most of its development over the summer. Activity dropped off in October, but by the looks of things, the few who stuck around with the coin appear to have been throwing hashes at the network for fun.\n\nCantorcoin\n\nFormer House Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s primary election loss in June was one of the United States’ notable political upsets of 2014.\n\nCantor lost to a more conservative opponent during the election, and stepped down from his leadership post shortly after the loss. Long considered the Republican Party’s strongest link to the Wall Street giants that finance the party, Cantor resigned from his seat in August and has since taken a position at a New York investment bank.\n\nCantor’s loss – which stunned the conservative political establishment in the US and catalyzed the Tea Party movement – was immortalized by cantorcoin (EIC), a short-lived cryptocurrency that tied its hardcoded properties to the occasion and sported the tagline “Moderately Rare – Conservatively Secure”.\n\nPitched as a commemorative coin marking the event, the coin never gained traction as an asset, but certainly provided a brief, if not utterly strange, way to bid farewell to Cantor’s tenure in office. The short-lived alt went quiet in July, according to its CryptoCoinTalk forum thread.\n\nConfessioncoin\n\nThe search for that so-called killer app of the Bitcoin protocol could be a defining factor in 2015, though whether explorations of this idea conducted in 2014 have any bearing on new developments remains to be seen.\n\nOne strange application CoinDesk came across was confessioncoin, an alt that essentially gave users an outlet to pseudononymously imprint their sins on the confessioncoin blockchain.\n\nThe cost: a fee of confessioncoin determined by a so-called ""confession wizard"" mechanism. As the developer noted about the project in May:\n\n""Peace of mind is surely worth the small price! In exchange for your penance, your confession will be stored anonymously in the blockchain, immortalized forever.""\n\nForum posts suggests that development may have dropped off in early December after suffering block processing problems in October. According to posted pool stats, it appears that at least some miners are keeping the compendium of confessions alive.\n\nWatcoin\n\nA plethora of so-called ""memecoins"" took to the proverbial stage in 2014, as developer sought to ride the same level of enthusiasm sparked by the memecoin supreme, dogecoin.\n\nWatcoin was a peculiarity among peculiarities given its rather unusual coin image, as well as the stated determination by its then-active development team to seek out the eponymous Wat Lady in order to grant a cryptocurrency gift.\n\n""Wat"", for those not in the know, has become, among some, an effective way to declare confusion, resignation or alarm in a digital setting.\n\nIndications on Bitcoin Talk suggest that watcoin was the subject of a community takeover over the summer, which resulted in a brief rebranding effort that saw the coin dubbed ""Wanted Attainable Traded"", or WATcoin. However, the thread seems to have gone silent in August.\n\nWhich altcoin(s) do you think stood out in 2014? The most innovative? Disruptive? Notorious? Bizzare?

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'A recent blog post titled “When Banks Become the Lawmakers” sparked a realization that banks, and companies that provide financial services in general, are now doing much more than that.\n\nIn a utopian world of free markets, the interests of any private corporation including banks would need to balance out against the interests of the consumers. In today’s world of continuously growing government, however, the now 3-way scale is heavily skewed against the consumer.\n\nThe Problem: The debts in the western economies have reached levels unlike anything in history. As a lifetime of work by Martin Armstrong demonstrates, all great dynasties from Athens to Rome eventually went to great lengths to confiscate the maximum amount of wealth from its citizens to prevent the inevitable collapse. So it is not surprising that today, the US as the global supper power has deputized financial institutions to levels not seen before. While at the same time the common view on the street is that the financial institutions are the demons in the equation.\n\nThe Outcome: The hunt for Tax Revenue is reaching new levels as stricter enforcement of laws like FATCA along with filling out FBAR paperwork. Banks can now be held legally liable or be boycotted from the global financial markets if they do not collect all information on their customers and report certain things to the authorities. Perhaps many of these laws have always been on the books, but it’s the level of enforcement that maters.\n\nDomestically in the US, it’s becoming very clear that every transaction is being monitored. Most people probably know that all transactions over US$10,000 are monitored by the FBI even though that amount is definitely not worth what it was when the law was put in place.\n\nRecent incidents however, are demonstrating that even small transactions are monitored as well. Most likely it’s because banks have gotten to a point where everything is suspicious to appease the government that is demanding a report on anything they feel might be a tax avoidance. In this example, a Mexican restaurant had its bank account (with an ‘unreasonable’ sum of US$33,000) seized, all because this small cash-only business was always making deposits of less than US$10,000.\n\nThe fines in regard to those the government deems as being tax evaders are reaching unrealistic levels. In cases of unreported foreign accounts, it is now impossible to tell whether these fines were meant as a deterrent, or simply as a way to “confiscate the car” because the driver was either lazy, forgot or decided not to turn on his signal when switching lanes.\n\nFor a hypothetical example, let’s say someone is holding US$1 million in a foreign account that was never declared to the US Government in an FBAR filing. After four years of depriving the US Government of its birthright to taxes on the interest, this account earning 1% a year in interest would come with a tax bill of approximately US$14,000 total.\n\nHowever, if the bank was to report the account holder to the US authorities, the regulation calls for a penalty of up to 50% the account’s value for every year of non-reporting. So the IRS can go after the account holder for over US$2 Million or approximately double the value of the account.\n\nBefore anyone says that their government would never do that, and perhaps when the law was put on the books that type of overreach was not in consideration, it was exactly what was done in the case of Carl Zwerner of Miami. In a more egregious example, Ty Warner, the brains behind the Beanie Baby craze, was fined US$54 million for keeping money in foreign accounts that deprived the United States of less than US$1 million in interest tax revenue.\n\nHe will forever be branded as a tax cheat by the Main Stream Media, but more importantly, anyone who thinks the government will put the US$54 million to a better use than this entrepreneur, will have a tough time surviving in the near future as the collapse of the unaffordable socialist system unfolds.\n\nOne of the worst things that the financial industry is currently doing is choosing who can and can’t operate accounts in order to appease the Government. We all know about the trouble the Bitcoin industry has had in maintaining banking relationships, but it appears that they are just scared of any advancement in technology and privacy. Lately it seems that\n\nPayPal is shutting down accounts on a whim; with perhaps one of their most high-profile incidents came with ProtonMail’s crowd funding account. The inquiry yielded the following statement from a PayPal representative to Andy Yen, CEO of ProtonMail:\n\n“He questioned whether ProtonMail is legal and if we have government approval to encrypt emails.”\n\nWe already see this trend happening in the Bitcoin space as well as with recent reports about Coinbase selectively shutting down accounts. Of course, the problem is not that Coinbase wants to shut down anyone’s account, it’s all because they are interfacing with the legacy fiat financial system, and they are not to be alone. Companies like Circle and approved exchanges will all do this government bidding. Once again, there is a very blurry line about who is in control between the consumer, the service provider and the government, with its arbitrary financial laws preying upon everyone.\n\nThe Solution: Attempting to change the system from the inside by electing the right politician or adding more laws on top of laws will never solve the problem. And there are too many incidents to name of what happens to those who attempt to expose the truth starting with Edward Snowden. Perhaps this is one of the reasons Satoshi Nakamoto remained anonymous when bringing Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology to the world.\n\nAs Bitcoin pioneers like Charlie Shrem are now going to jail for spreading the power of new technology around the world, it’s clear that the solutions need to be built into the system. The more dependence and interaction the Blockchain has with the legacy financial system, the more these innovative new companies would be expected to be law enforcement deputies.\n\nBitcoin is providing the power for everyone to be their own bank, but the public must first understand why this is important and start taking steps to be more responsible when it comes to securing their wealth.\n\nThis movement began because financial law enforcers like PayPal along with Visa and Mastercard decided to do the government’s bidding with their dislike for Wikileaks as they shut down their accounts. We might look back upon those days in irony of how the financial law enforcers were instrumental in their own demise.\n\nLet’s just hope that the next time there is a similar overreach, whether by the legacy financial system or Bitcoin companies trying to appease debt ridden Governments, it drives more and more people into direct peer-to-peer crypto currency transactions.', 'Richard Fairman JANUARY 11, 2015 0 Time moves on. The young players from the back streets of Caracas who captured the public imagination when they toured the world’s musical capitals as the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra are no longer as young as they were. The word “Youth” was dropped from the orchestra’s title five years ago. The players look as if they are nearing their thirties. Otherwise, though, nothing seems to have changed. This concert, the first of two at Southbank Centre, brought them back to the scene of some of their most memorable successes, once again with Gustavo Dudamel as conductor, and playing with the same combustible mix of raw energy and wide-eyed enthusiasm that set the audience cheering at their Proms debut back in 2007. In short, they still play like a youth orchestra — for good or ill. It is always exciting to see a concert platform heaving with players, as it usually is with youth orchestras, and the massive sound made by the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra governs the kind of music-making it can offer. Subtlety is barely an option and that is not Dudamel’s style anyway. He stamped out the opening motif of Beethoven’s Symphony No.\u20095 with the orchestra’s full force, not so much fate knocking on the door as almost breaking it down. Conductor and players threw themselves into the music, riding roughshod over patches of rocky ensemble and careering around precipitous changes of tempo. The finale was a blaze of brassy triumph. This was all-or-nothing Beethoven and quite gripping. After the interval even more players appeared (12 double basses alone). Excerpts from Wagner’s Ring might seem to invite excess, but now the sheer size of the sound became unwieldy and Dudamel’s heavy-handed conducting did not help. There was some good individual playing, notably some poetic wind solos in the “Forest Murmurs” from Siegfried, but brass tuning was poor and massed strings were on the clumsy side. The gods entered Valhalla so slowly that it sounded as if they did not want to go. Siegfried’s Funeral March dragged its feet. Only with a rousing “Ride of the Valkyries” did Dudamel and his players get airborne with the uplifting sense of exhilaration that is their trademark. At last that youthful spirit was in the air again. southbankcentre.co.uk Photograph: Nohely Oliveros Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'The man accused of running the Silk Road, the Internet\'s biggest drug market, is about to get his day in court. Prosecutors and defense lawyers are already poring over juror questionnaires, and a panel of New York citizens will be selected on Tuesday.\n\nThere still isn\'t much that\'s been made public about how the trial will proceed. Whatever happens, the trial, expected to last at least four weeks, is sure to reveal more about the dark corners of the so-called ""Darknet"" and the authorities\' efforts to master it.\n\nRoss Ulbricht, the 30-year-old Texan who prosecutors say was the mastermind of the drug trafficking website, has remained steadfast in his innocence since his arrest more than a year ago. Barring a last-minute deal, his fate will soon be in the hands of a jury. If convicted, he faces decades in prison.\n\nSilk Road wasn\'t the first place on the Internet that sold drugs, but it quickly became the biggest, and boldest. The site was founded in early 2011, and burst into the public consciousness in June of that year, when Gawker published an article showcasing ""The Underground Website Where You Can Buy Any Drug Imaginable."" Everything on Silk Road was bought and sold using bitcoin, a peer-to-peer digital currency.\n\n""Right now you can buy an 1/8th of pot on Silk Road for 7.63 Bitcoins,"" explained reporter Adrian Chen, who noted that a single Bitcoin was worth $8.67 when his article was published. ""That\'s probably more than you would pay on the street, but most Silk Road users seem happy to pay a premium for convenience.""\n\nThe openness of the market—screenshots of product, quality reviews akin to legitimate sites like eBay—outraged some politicians, who called on police agencies to shutter the site. ""It\'s a certifiable one-stop shop for illegal drugs that represents the most brazen attempt to peddle drugs online that we have ever seen,"" fumed Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), in a press conference arranged days after the Gawker scoop.\n\nSilk Road wasn\'t just bold, it was effective. An earlier marketplace, the Farmer\'s Market, saw about $1 million in drug sales between 2007 and 2009, according to the indictment against that site. A 2012 study on Silk Road found it was selling more than about twice that amount every month. The site\'s administrator, who called himself Dread Pirate Roberts, didn\'t ship product himself. Instead, he took a cut of each sale, between 8 and 15 percent depending on size, prosecutors say.\n\nDuring the site\'s lifespan, authorities said it had facilitated well over one million transactions, with a total value of about $1.2 billion. DPR got $80 million in commissions.\n\nFor the most part, the site\'s sellers kept their customers satisfied. On a five-star rating scale, 96.5 percent of buyers gave five-star ratings, and 1.3 percent gave four-star ratings, while just 1.1 percent gave the lowest rating of one star.\n\nThe Silk Road was finally shuttered in October 2013. Federal agents burst into a public library in San Francisco, where they arrested Ulbricht, who was sitting in the science fiction section working on his laptop. This, they said, was the Dread Pirate Roberts, the admin who held the site together. Not only was he the center of an online drug empire, he stood accused of using violence to defend it: Ulbricht had ordered the murder of no less than six people, according to the indictment.\n\nThe site\'s phenomenal success bred imitators. Within a month of the site\'s collapse, the Darknet featured ""Silk Road 2.0,"" which used almost everything from the model of the original site, down to the green camel logo. The site was infiltrated by law enforcement, almost from the inception; in November, Blake Benthall was arrested and fingered as ""Defcon,"" the new site\'s admin. Like Ulbricht, he is a young, tech-savvy man, living a modest life in a shared San Francisco apartment.\n\nIdentity\n\nThe biggest question of the trial is clear: is Ross Ulbricht Dread Pirate Roberts? In order to convince a jury that he isn\'t, there\'s a lot of evidence Ulbricht\'s attorney, Joshua Dratel, will have to explain.\n\nThe evidence pointing to Ulbricht dates from the earliest days of the site. The jury will see the posts on forums like shroomery.org and Bitcoin Talk, that sought out engineering talent and advertised an ""anonymous amazon.com."" The early posts pointed to silkroad420.wordpress.com, a site with instructions about how to get to the Tor-only, anonymous site. One of those posts directed interested respondents to email ""rossulbricht at gmail dot com.""\n\nThat same Gmail address was attached to an account on Stack Overflow, where Ulbricht asked programming questions like: ""How can I connect to a Tor hidden service using curl in php?""\n\nThe toughest evidence to explain will be what authorities pulled from Ulbricht\'s laptop, the computer he was using when he was arrested in the public library. Prosecutors say he kept a log on his computer, which seems to correspond to DPR\'s attempts to take out his enemies. According to the government, in April 2013 Ulbricht was making notes on his computer that said ""sent payment to angels for hit on tony76 and his 3 associates,"" among other incriminating statements. The dates correspond with DPR\'s messages captured through the Silk Road system.\n\nEven though the government didn\'t feel like it had enough evidence to actually charge Ulbricht with attempted murder, the judge is allowing all of that evidence into the trial. She accepted the government\'s argument, that the evidence is part of a story that points to Ulbricht as the real boss of Silk Road.\n\nThe first of the six ""hits,"" against a former Silk Road employee who DPR thought had stolen money, was set up by a government agent. DPR was sent a fake photo ""confirming"" the murder, before he sent over the rest of the $80,000 fee, prosecutors say. As for the next five murders, offered up to DPR by a user named ""redandwhite,"" the government admits it has no evidence any violence took place. Roberts paid $650,000 for what may have been an elaborate scam.\n\nGetting the murder-for-hire evidence in the case puts the authorities in an excellent tactical position: they can talk about the accusations of violence, without needing to prove them. That\'s helped them at every stage of the case, especially in making sure Ulbricht didn\'t get bail. Last week, Ulbricht\'s lawyer lost his attempt to keep the murder-for-hire evidence out of the case; the jury will hear all the gory details, even though they won\'t render a decision on it.\n\nTechnology\n\nAs the government lays out its case, it will have to reveal more detail about how the Silk Road was taken down. The most valuable evidence from the government will likely be what they found on Ulbricht\'s seized computer, which prosecutors say includes logs describing the attempted murders, as well as spreadsheets detailing Silk Road\'s finances. At the time of his arrest, he had opened a page called ""mastermind"" which showed the site\'s recent transactions.\n\nDespite the lack of attempted murder charges, those accusations are critical to shaping the perception of Ulbricht that prosecutors want to take hold in the minds of jurors—and the public. The trial won\'t be all digital forensics; both sides will have to make a case about what Ulbricht\'s intent was, to explain whatever involvement he had in the site.\n\nComparing that data to the data they copied from the Silk Road servers will be a critical part of the case. But it still isn\'t completely clear how the government found the Silk Road servers at all. Early on, Ulbricht\'s lawyer suggested that the NSA might have helped out.\n\nTo counter that allegation, the FBI had to show more of its cards. ""Ulbricht conjures up a bogeyman – the National Security Agency,"" wrote prosecutors in September. They said the FBI was able to find the server through an error in the Silk Road login page that leaked an Icelandic IP address. Reykjavik police went to the data center that held Silk Road\'s server and secretly made a copy of the data.\n\nSilk Road used a CAPTCHA service that pulled data from the open Internet, which ""leaked"" the true IP address. Some security researchers saw problems with that story, though; Nicholas Weaver, a computer researcher at UC Berkeley, looked at the Silk Road traffic logs made public by the FBI, and said ""the leaky CAPTCHA story is full of holes.” Other observers said the FBI\'s tactics looked more like hacking than a lucky break caused by security error.\n\nIn any case, law enforcement arrested a variety of Silk Road vendors, apparently without the help of any special technology—they simply bought drugs, then apparently found the shippers didn\'t cover their tracks well enough. One such arrest was Cornelis Jan Slomp, a 22-year-old Dutch seller named ""SuperTrip,"" arrested in the summer of 2013, when Silk Road was still doing a brisk business.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe government tried to get an order banning any mention of Ulbricht\'s libertarian politics; the judge denied that request as moot, saying she was satisfied with the defense\'s assurances that they are “well aware of the limits on appropriate argument.""\n\nDPR talked a big game when it came to how idealistic the site was. In his single extensive interview, conducted with Forbes just two months before the bust, DPR emphasized that the site refused to sell anything that could ""harm innocent people."" Stolen goods, counterfeit money, hitmen, child pornography—none of that had a place in his market.\n\nWhen it came to selling drugs, though, DPR had no remorse. He said:\n\nI am proud of what I do. I can’t think of one drug that doesn’t have at least some harmful effects. That’s really not the point though. People own themselves, they own their bodies, and it is their right to put into their bodies whatever they choose. It’s not my place, or the government’s, or anyone else’s to say what a person does with their own body. Giving people that freedom of choice and the dignity of self-ownership is a good thing.\n\nHis view of peer-to-peer technology was utopian. ""This is just the beginning,"" DPR explained:\n\nIt’s really part of a larger transformation, driven by peer-to-peer technology and the internet as a whole. The people now can control the flow and distribution on information, and the flow of money. Sector by sector the state is being cut out of the equation and power is being returned to the individual. I don’t think anyone can comprehend the magnitude of the revolution we are in. I think it will be looked back on as an epoch in the evolution of mankind.\n\nThe tone is reminiscent of things Ulbricht said in a public LinkedIn post. ""I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind,"" he wrote. ""I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.""\n\nBut while Ulbricht\'s politics won\'t necessarily play a big role at trial, they matter to his supporters. Ulbricht\'s arrest has motivated his friends and family, as well as supporters of legalizing drug laws, who have shown up since his first court appearances. His supporters have posited the case as being about Internet freedom itself. On Tuesday, some of them have made clear their intention to show up to the federal courthouse in Manhattan where Ulbricht will be tried.\n\nArs will also be there, describing the scene in court.']"

KPMG’s accreditation is an important milestone, as it demonstrates our commitment to delivering both best-in-class technology and deep operational expertise.”\n\nSmith added that Elliptic is “absolutely confident” in its technology, but went on to note that a bitcoin storage company needs to offer more than its own confidence.\n\n“This report demonstrates to our customers that we have the rigorous internal processes and controls expected of any traditional financial services provider,” he said. “Combined with our comprehensive insurance protection, they provide the robust infrastructure required for institutional involvement in digital currencies.”\n\nElliptic’s focus on security\n\nSince its inception and launch a year ago, Elliptic has tried to differentiate itself by offering “deep cold storage” techniques for bitcoin, backed by insurance ""providing protection against theft of stored bitcoins"".\n\nAfter an early attempt to gain cover from Lloyds of London broke down, the company was forced to look for alternative insurance providers and eventually managed to insure its holdings through insurance brokers CBC Insurance.\n\nA few months later, in July 2014, Elliptic managed to secure $2m in seed funding from Octopus Investments.\n\nKPMG offices via Gordon Bell / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The customer has allegedly not been paying its bills for services it has been receiving from the Bluffdale, Utah-based data center provider.\n\nThe lawsuit, in which the plaintiff is seeking to recover about $5.4 million in damages, comes at a difficult time for all players in the bitcoin ecosystem. The digital currency’s value has been falling steadily since hitting a high of nearly $1,200 at one point in 2014.\n\nIt is currently below $280, prompting one cloud mining service provider, CEX.io, to halt mining altogether, saying it was no longer profitable. The company’s CIO Jeffrey Smith told CoinDesk that it will start mining again if the price exceeds $320.\n\nCoinTerra manufactures and sells bitcoin mining hardware and hosts and manages mining hardware for customers as a service. A Redditor who claims to be a customer of CoinTerra’s bitcoin mining services said in a Reddit post two day ago that the company did not send him or her their weekly payout.\n\nThe Redditor pasted a statement they received from CoinTerra’s legal department, saying the company had defaulted on debt, and that its lenders had liens on all of its assets, including servers.\n\nCoinTerra has been a C7 customer since April 2014, using its colocation, hosting, monitoring, and management services. The 18-month contract is for services in three separate C7 data centers, according to summary of the allegations in the lawsuit.\n\nAs of early December, CoinTerra’s past due balance was about $1.4 million, but C7 is seeking $5.4 million or more in damages, which includes total cost of services for the duration of the contract and other damages.\n\n“Upon information and belief, CoinTerra chose to pay C7 less than the amounts due in bad faith,” the allegations read.\n\nCoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar did not return a call seeking comment in time for publication. We’ll update this post once we hear back from him.\n\nPower is the biggest cost of providing data center services. C7 said it has been paying more than $12,000 per day just to supply power to CoinTerra. C7’s latest invoice issued to the client was for about $430,000, and about $350,000 of the total was for electricity.\n\nThe data center provider also claims it has incurred losses by turning down other potential customers to accommodate CoinTerra’s needs.\n\nC7 is not the only data center provider CoinTerra uses. CenturyLink Technology Solutions announced in July 2014 a big colocation deal with the bitcoin mining company. Iyengar told Data Center Knowledge at the time that the deal was for north of 10 megawatts of capacity.\n\nA CenturyLink representative declined to comment, citing confidentiality of the contractual agreement between the two companies.', ""Bitcoin mining service CEX.io has announced it will suspend its cloud mining activities.\n\nThe company stated in a 12th January blog post that it is no longer profitable, blaming declining revenues amid a dropping bitcoin price. CEX chief information officer Jeffrey Smith told CoinDesk that operations would resume if the price of bitcoin climbs above $320, calling the move “temporary”.\n\nThe suspension comes after CEX customers experienced disruptions to their cloud mining service, which the company at the time attributed to third-party complications. Smith said that the two issues are unrelated; that the economic impact of a drop in bitcoin prices cut into its ability to offer its clients profitable mining services.\n\nIndications from CEX’s forums suggest that customers were informed over the weekend about both the risk of unprofitability as well as stipulations in the customer terms of service related to potential stoppages. On Friday, a CEX spokesperson cited the former when asked about reported customer compensation issues.\n\nSmith told CoinDesk:\n\n“Our decision is based on the fact that we pay for maintenance in [US dollars], and mine bitcoins, and if you do the math – you will see that with the next mining difficulty rise – maintenance costs will be greater than the profit from mining.”\n\nNo broader company impact\n\nAccording to CEX, the company will continue to honor customer balances for cloud hashing power and previous discussions to secure cheaper resources will continue. Smith added that clients will also have the option to turn on their cloud mining capacity should they choose.\n\nSmith acknowledged that CEX had foreseen the risk of unprofitable mining, and said that the company is actively seeking solutions to both address the problems related to its cloud mining unit, as well as continue to push development of both its cryptocurrency exchange and mining pool, GHash.io.\n\n“Now we are going to concentrate all our resources on building out the best crypto exchange and on the search of hardware providers and cheap electricity,” he said.\n\nHe added that CEX has no plans to significantly adjust its operational strategy in the wake of the cloud mining suspension, though he noted that the company could be impacted in the long term as it moves to diversify its services.\n\nCustomers react\n\nSmith’s announcement on Twitter elicited a response from observers and customers, prompting some to speculate about CEX’s future and what led to the cloud mining stoppage.\n\nSigns from the CEX marketplace for hashing power suggest that some customers may be selling their holdings in the wake of the suspension. Questions have also been raised about whether or not other companies that offer cloud mining services have been impacted by the recent drop in the price of bitcoin.\n\nNews of the suspension among the wider community has been met by a mixture of dismay and frustration. On the company’s official forum, one customer said that the suspension should have been put in place before the problems worsened, writing:\n\n“Maintenance costs are just too high. No profit can be made. Heck, I was losing money by owning GHs from CEX. Even worse, I sold all of my GHs and, because I had additional hashing power from referrals, I was still losing money.”\n\n“I have faith that CEX will rebound from this,” the user added. “But, these exorbitant fees have got to change otherwise it'll be the end of CEX.”\n\nImages via CEX.io, Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

To complete the withdrawal, the user enters both codes into the ATM. Users can locate the nearest participating ATM by searching on the Hal-Cash website.\n\nThe app\'s apparent speed and ease of use as well as the accessible nature of the service have been highlighted as its main advantages.\n\nCommission rates\n\nLike most bitcoin ATM services, Bit2Me commission fees are higher than more traditional alternatives. As such, CoinDesk found some concern among Spain\'s bitcoin community over Bit2Me\'s planned cost structure.\n\nCurrently Bit2Me is running a special offer charging its users a 1% commission per transaction. As of February, the service will incur a variable charge based on the withdrawn amount. For example, if a user withdraws €100 they will be charged a 4% fee. Fees of €1.5 are also applied by the user\'s bank.\n\nJorge Ordovas, a Spanish bitcoin enthusiast, said:\n\n""The fee is somewhat high compared to other alternatives, but the high number of available and easily accessible ATMs might make it worth it.""\n\nFerreira admitted that Bit2Me\'s costs are somewhat high, saying ""it is not the cheapest option out there, [but] it is the easiest and fastest way of converting bitcoin into euros"".\n\nDaniel Diez, a Spanish startup mentor and cryptocurrency expert, added that although the current fees are high, Bit2Me is still in its early stages and should be able to adapt its pricing to the response of its users.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'In Hanover, Germany, a new company is using Bitcoin to get electronic payments accepted by local merchants.\n\nMost restaurants and stores in Hanover only accept cash. Credit cards are not the phenomenon they are in the States, and merchants have to pay very high fees to accept debit cards. That means consumers always have to carry cash. But serial entrepreneur Ricardo Ferrer Rivero decided he wanted more options. Rather than work with banks, Rivero reasoned that getting merchants to accept Bitcoin could be a workable solution.\n\nSo he gathered a few local technologists, developers, and industrial designers to create a 3D-printed Bitcoin point of sale that doesn’t cost a thing to use.\n\nThe project came together because Rivero had extra time on his hands after one of his companies sold to Atlassian. He asked merchants what it would take for them to accept Bitcoin, and they said their major concern was that working with Bitcoin would be too complex and that the currency was too volatile.\n\nSo Rivero, a perpetual tinkerer, started thinking and talking to friends about the project. The idea was to develop a Bitcoin standard that every wallet could integrate with, so it would be easy to use for consumers. The product also had to be simple and low risk for merchants.\n\nUsing old Google Nexus 7 phones bought off eBay, he and some friends got to work. They first installed a new version of Android and then customized both the software and hardware. BitPay agreed to work with them as the payment processor and also developed a tailored system for Hanover’s merchants that lowered risk from Bitcoin price fluctuation. But the customer experience needed work. In order to get Android phones enabled with NFC to communicate with other NFC devices, you have to put them back to back.\n\n“Its kind of awkward,” said Rivero. With a little soldering, he and his colleagues reconfigured the device so that the merchant could punch in the cost of the item, and created a surface where the customer could easily approach with their phone and tap to have their transaction information transferred over. It was a crude hack, but it worked. Meanwhile the industrial design team had created 3D-printed housing for the phone.\n\nWhile the company was in the midst of tweaking its POS, Apple’s NFC enabled mobile payment option, Apple Pay, rolled out. It immediately raised Rivero’s expectations for how his mobile payment platform should be.\n\n“We wanted to reach that standard of usability,” said Rivero. “But I noticed it wasn’t going to be possible through the normal channels.”\n\nApple Pay enables users to open their phone and pay in-store with the touch of button. While there are criticisms of how well Apple Pay works in practice, it’s still fairly elegant compared with other mobile pay experiences. To get a similar effect, Rivero and his team installed an iBeacon on terminals, so that when consumers get within a few feet of the iBeacon, a push notification gets sent to their phone. Clicking on the link automatically opens an app to facilitate the transaction. But, in order to get the wallets to auto-launch, Ferrer needed to collaborate with existing wallets like Coinbase or Blockchain. He also had a self-imposed time constraint: He wanted to get this thing up and running in a few weeks’ time.\n\nThe Bitcoin wallets Rivero had reached out to were enthusiastic about the project but could not commit to putting together a solution in a such a short period of time. Luckily, around the same time, an iOS developer reached out to Ferrer expressing interest in joining the project. That’s when Ferrer and his crew decided to build their own app that would launch whatever Bitcoin wallet the user linked to it.\n\nWhat started as a project has turned into a company, called Pey. So far, 50 Hanover merchants have agreed to accept Bitcoin, and 12 units have already been installed in stores. But, Rivero wants to grow that number to 100. Merchants have good reason to sign-up: Pey is giving the terminal and its software away for free as well as providing the Internet connection.\n\n“We currently charge no fee, basically because we see ourselves as a hardware company. So we’re giving it to people and trying to learn from it,” said Rivero.\n\nEventually the company plans to sell the terminal — or potentially lease it — but it’s still working out the details. In any case, it will likely be a while before Pey starts charging for its system. In the meantime, it’s building a beta ecosystem where the company can test and tweak until it’s ready to roll out a finished product. Already the company is working on a next generation version of the terminal built on Raspberry Pi.\n\nPey is also going to start raising capital.\n\nPerhaps most striking about Pey is that it’s using Bitcoin to solve an actual problem. In places like the U.S. and U.K., which have their own ecosystem of Bitcoin companies, there isn’t a lot of need for Bitcoin. Banking infrastructure is strong, credit is plentiful, and there are a variety of ways to transact money digitally. But in Hanover, Pey has the potential to solve the problem of enabling cashless transactions without having to change the region’s existing banking infrastructure. If Pey can target more regions like Hanover, it may have some real potential to grow.\n\n*Updated: An earlier version of this article left off Ricardo Ferrer’s last name, Rivero.', 'Post-Trade Settlement will Allow Some Customers to Trade Prior to Making a Deposit.\n\nCoinsetter bitcoin exchange, has announced the ability for “select business customers” to trade on margin accounts. and “post trade settlement”. Post-trade settlement allows customers to place trades on Coinsetter’s order book before making a deposit. This feature allows customers to trade without holding large balances on an exchange, and his described as thus limiting their exposure to third-party risks. Certain customers will now also be allowed to Short Bitcoin as well.\n\nJaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of Coinsetter, said:\n\n“We have been testing a post-trade settlement offering with select business customers since December, and its value is apparent. Coinsetter’s business customers, many of whom represent important institutions in the bitcoin space, can now access liquidity without having to worry about bitcoins being hacked or USD holdings becoming tied up. The program also helps growing companies reduce their working capital burdens.”\n\nCoinsetter believes its new features improve security and infrastructure in the bitcoin market – something that was tested last week in the fallout from the Bitstamp hacking attack. After depositing collateral in the form of bitcoin, Coinsetter will allow select businesses to buy and sell bitcoin on margin, settling balances after trades are executed. This model is aligned with the settlement method of exchanges in other markets on Wall Street.\n\n“The experienced team at Coinsetter is committed to providing clients with the most advanced bitcoin exchange in the world. The features announced today raise the bar even further.” Lukasiewicz added. “Our top priority remains security, and all users benefit from Coinsetter’s Securicoin technology. Bitcoins held in the Securicoin® system are contained in highly protected offline wallets that never directly touch the internet. Furthermore, a human is always involved to verify the validity of each withdrawal.” .\n\nCoinsetter, founded in 2012, is described as “Wall Streets’ leading bitcoin exchange for firms and individuals”.', 'Photo: Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWho do you call if you want to call Bitcoin?\n\nFor officials in Washington, the question might not be as vexing as its Europe-related counterpart, sure. But it is one that Jerry Brito, formerly of the free-markets-loving Mercatus Center at George Mason University, started to ponder last year.\n\nWith the infamous Satoshi Nakamoto unavailable, there were scant resources available for policymakers and regulators when they had questions about the mechanics of the block chain, or the theft of huge sums of the currency, or its wild swings in value. Moreover, Bitcoin had few advocates on the Hill as the wonks in Washington started to ponder whether and how to regulate the technology-slash-currency.\n\n“Folks in Washington have heard about Bitcoin, and they understand it’s something they have to start paying attention to,” Brito told me. “But they have the general public’s understanding of it.” He paused a beat. “That means they don’t know a lot about it.”\n\nTo fill the gap — and backed with a million dollars in industry cash — Brito launched a nonprofit, Coin Center, in September. (It got a spiffy new website this month.) The mission is threefold, he said: educate lawmakers and regulators about what Bitcoin is and is not; perform policy research; and act as a booster for Bitcoin.\n\n“We’re advocates,” Brito said. “We’re not advocating on behalf of any particular company or industry. We think simply that this technology offers a lot of benefits to consumers and to the wider economy and the world generally.”\n\nFor the venture-capital types with millions of dollars — or bitcoins — on the line, the interest in having some muscle on the Hill seems more straightforward.\n\nTo many legislators, Bitcoin is not so much a potentially transformative network, but a conduit for drug money, a speculative punt, a way of making untraceable financial transactions, and a vehicle for shirking taxes. Last year, Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, called on federal regulators to ban it outright. “The clear ends of Bitcoin for either transacting in illegal goods and services or speculative gambling make me weary [sic] of its use,” he wrote. “Before the U.S. gets too far behind the curve on this important topic, I urge the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans.”\n\nNot all legislators are so averse, of course. In response to Manchin’s letter, Representative Jared Polis of Colorado called for a ban on dollar bills. “The exchange of dollar bills, including high denomination bills, is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly subject to forgery, theft, and loss,” he wrote. “I urge regulators to take immediate and appropriate action to limit the use of dollar bills.”\n\nBut one way or another, any number of agencies and offices have gotten interested. (See this recent Securities and Exchange Commission action, for instance, or this licensing proposal from New York state.) In response, the community of Bitcoin investors and activists has bulked up their Hill operations over the past year — with some arguing that regulatory clarity would help Bitcoin grow and make it more legitimate in the eyes of the business community at large, and some arguing that the crypto-currency needs regulators’ hands off.\n\nLast year, the Bitcoin Foundation retained a lobbying firm “to carry information about Bitcoin” to legislators. “Governments cannot eliminate Bitcoin from the globe, of course — it’s an idea whose time has come,” the foundation’s Jim Harper wrote. “But they will have a large role in determining Bitcoin’s adoption rate.” The nonprofit Chamber of Digital Commerce launched, also promising to be an “authoritative representative for the industry.” And individual companies hired or registered some political muscle, too, among them Falcon Global Capital and MasterCard.\n\nNow there is Coin Center. Right now, Brito said, the challenge is to ensure that Washington does not trample or delimit the technology, which remains embryonic, like the internet in the early 1990s. “It’s one thing that people miss about Bitcoin and the block chain,” he said. “It’s what they missed about the web, too: They’re open platforms for innovation. Back in 1995, when people were talking about the web, we couldn’t imagine a Facebook. We couldn’t imagine a Twitter.” Right now, people tend to think of Bitcoin as a payments network and alternative currency, he said, but that’s “just one application.”\n\nAnd when legislators do have questions, at least there’s someone to call.', 'The organizers of a large-scale project to make bitcoin available over the counter at thousands of Taiwanese convenience stores have spoken about the efforts it took to bring their plan to fruition.\n\nThe main hurdles were overcoming lack of knowledge about bitcoin and local regulatory fears among mainstream businesses, according to local exchange BitoEX.\n\nDespite these, the company still managed to launch a fully operational bitcoin-purchasing service in October, with a rollout to 2,980 Family Mart stores. It then expanded to over 5,000 stores in total, with the addition of the OK MART and Hi-Life chains.\n\nBitoEX anticipates the total number of stores could reach 12,000 by March this year, and told CoinDesk about plans to extend the service to other countries in Asia.\n\nThe company says it is funded by its founders\' own capital, along with input from angel investors, with a total of $2.5m raised so far.\n\nCautious approach\n\nCEO Titan Cheng said his company had been through ""quite a hard time"" in its negotiations with its new partners, particularly concerning local regulation.\n\nThe firm began negotiations with Family Mart representatives shortly after it launched in May 2014.\n\n""We spent at least three months discussing the regulation and taxation problems with them. After determining compliance with the laws and regulation in Taiwan, we formally signed contracts and started the cooperation.""\n\nAlthough customers can pay for and receive bitcoins over the counter within a minute, under the deal, convenience stores will only return the fiat funds to BitoEX a week later.\n\n""The more convenience stores in cooperation, the more working capital we need to prepare in order to cope with the huge number of transactions.""\n\nThis meant that BitoEX needed to partner with larger bitcoin exchanges in other countries for liquidity. Supplying the required quantities of bitcoins to Taiwan are international exchange OKCoin, and Hong Kong-based KBBEX.\n\nHow the service works\n\nUsing existing multi-service touchscreen kiosks located in the convenience stores, customers enter the amount of bitcoin they wish to buy in Taiwanese dollars (plus a roughly $0.75 service fee) and their mobile phone number.\n\nThe kiosks print a receipt for customers to take to the counter and pay with cash, while an SMS message is sent to the mobile number with a link to BitoEX\'s website. Upon visiting the site, customers can specify a bitcoin address to receive the funds.\n\nThe system presupposes a degree of bitcoin knowledge and existing address to use, though is no more complex than receiving coins from a bitcoin ATM – and much less so than ATMs requiring ID-verified accounts.\n\nCustomer Jason Gatewood made the video below to demonstrate the bitcoin buying process:\n\nBitcoin in Taiwan\n\nDespite the size of its population (23.4 million) and its GDP (20th in the world) Taiwan hasn\'t appeared often on the bitcoin radar – at least, not in the retail sense.\n\nDigital entertainment company Wayi announced in December 2013 it would become a bitcoin exchange and accept bitcoins at its online mall, though a year on there appears little if any mention of bitcoin on its main site.\n\nIn January, Taiwan\'s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) threw a roadblock in front of bitcoin\'s advance when it prevented one of the earliest rollouts of Robocoin bitcoin ATMs.\n\nAt the time, the FSC cited bitcoin\'s lack of status as a legal currency to justify its action.\n\nBy May, however, there was at least one Lamassu one-way machine operating in Taipei.\n\n""Taiwan is a country that attaches great importance to the interests of consumers,"" Cheng said.\n\nWhile there are still not many businesses accepting bitcoin in Taiwan so far – with most users seeing it as an investment – BitoEX plans to promote the use of digital currency by opening up its API and holding a hackathon to develop new use cases.\n\nLiquidity partners\n\nKBBEX CEO Patrick Lam said it had initially been a ""great surprise"" to hear that BitoEX had been successful in penetrating the convenience store space.\n\nRealizing the two companies had a common goal to promote bitcoin development, he communicated with Cheng and negotiated the two companies\' cooperation.\n\nKBBEX began trading bitcoins over-the-counter about a year and a half ago, and launched its main exchange platform in December after receiving $1.5m from a private equity fund a few months earlier.\n\nThe exchange serves clients primarily in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, plus other Asian countries. English and Simplified Chinese versions of its site will launch this month, and services will extend to mainland China in the first quarter of the year.\n\nOKCoin, the more established exchange, is one of the world\'s busiest in both USD and CNY (yuan) volumes. Its Chinese operation, OKCoin.cn, is headquartered in Beijing and its international arm, OKCoin.com, is registered in Singapore.\n\nThe company now operates a multitude of bitcoin exchange services for amateurs and professionals, including margin trading, futures, mobile apps and now P2P lending to earn interest. Notably, it passed a cryptographic audit of its bitcoin reserves last August.\n\nTaiwan street image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A ""clearnet"" version of Silk Road Reloaded can also be accessed from normal browsers.\n\nUnlike many online marketplaces that only accept Bitcoin or a limited range of cryptocurrencies, Silk Road Reloaded claims to accept pretty much any form of payment. Bitcoin, Anoncoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin are all accepted with transactions being converted into Bitcoin before being processed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDozens of copycat marketplaces have cropped up on the dark net trying to cash in on Silk Road\'s success. The alleged founder of the original Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, AKA Dread Pirate Roberts, is soon to face trial in New York. During the site\'s lifespan more than one million transactions were made totalling $1.2 billion (£795m). It is estimated that Dread Pirate Roberts took $80 million (£53m) in commissions from these transactions. Both Silk Road and Silk Road 2.0 have been shut down by the FBI.\n\nThe founder of Silk Road Reloaded has been promoting the new site on Reddit but people have criticised it for trying to cash in on the Silk Road name. One user said that nobody would touch a website named Silk Road ""with a ten foot pole"".', 'The way the community thinks about the bitcoin network is wrong, at least in the eyes of Buttercoin CEO Cedric Dahl. Maybe he won’t say it exactly, but it’s there, in the words he uses to describe the US-based “bitcoin marketplace” he heads, and the words he doesn’t.\n\nAt face value, Buttercoin’s market approach may seem simple – it’s a place where you can buy and sell bitcoin. But to Dahl, it’s a subtle but sizable change in the way we think about financial services enabled by both bitcoin and the Internet.\n\nTake, for example, the business he most often cites in conversation, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the e-commerce giant’s cloud computing platform for enterprise businesses. Though AWS’ revenue figures are not publicly available, estimates suggests it earns $3bn each year by removing the pain points that used to make the launch of websites prohibitive.\n\nIn a new interview with CoinDesk, Dahl explained that he sees Buttercoin as providing a similar service to US bitcoin businesses, only instead of hosting computer servers and supporting infrastructure, it will extend its ability to buy and sell bitcoin to other businesses to form the underlying platform for the bitcoin economy in the same way. Notably absent is any comparison to a business that would perform traditional financial services, with Dahl preferring to keep the conversation in terms of the web.\n\nBy achieving its vision, Dahl argued his 10-person company can provide what the bitcoin ecosystem truly needs, a way for new entrepreneurs to quickly launch new businesses.\n\nDahl explained:\n\n”It took us 18 months to be able to do this, and we’ve had fantastic backers. For the average developer out there, they don’t have a lot of options, but by providing these options, we feel strongly that we’re going to be able to increase the amount of innovation in the bitcoin space – specifically in the US.”\n\nIf Dahl sounds confident, his business’ resume has the credentials to color his conversation. Buttercoin’s investors include Google Ventures, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Wedbush Securities and Y Combinator – and figures show it has raised upwards of $1.25m to date.\n\nMoreover, Buttercoin today is operating in a US bitcoin market that has still yet to see the proliferation of trading platforms. With New York’s BitLicense still in limbo, the US is home to just a handful of businesses that provide buying and selling services to other businesses and institutions, including Coinsetter and Mirror (formerly Vaurum).\n\nRule of threes\n\nThe number three seems to reappear in conversation, whether Dahl’s talking about the “three tiers” under which existing bitcoin businesses fall or the company’s own market strategy, which he divides into dinner courses – appetizer, dinner and dessert. Having formally launched in November, Buttercoin is currently in the appetizer phase, he said.\n\n“Appetizer is all about bitcoin marketplace, make sure we’re able to provide a large amount of liquidity to bitcoin businesses and foundational services, really empower businesses to build on top of us,” Dahl stated.\n\nDuring this phase, Buttercoin is running a variety of what Dahl called pilot programs, where select companies and developers have been allowed into the ecosystem to begin building on its platform.\n\n“It’s a closed garden, we’ve invited about a dozen people, and I know you know them all, and this is part of us just operating quietly,” Dahl asserted.\n\nDahl explained that Buttercoin has been relatively silent about its partners, but that this is consistent with its goal of falling into the background. Though the interview finds Dahl in the middle of a “press push”, he views discretion as part of his company’s strategy:\n\n“We want to let the brands that decide to work with us decide when they’re comfortable doing so, so people get to keep their brands front and center.”\n\nMain course\n\nOnce its place in the US is established, Buttercoin plans to build similar marketplaces around the world, catering to businesses and large institutions while remaining in the background.\n\nDahl cautions that the company is not there yet, but that should it be able to take the technical and compliance burden off global startups, it is likely to find success wherever it decides to take its model.\n\n“When you think about bitcoin wallets, most of them get the majority of their volume from marketplaces like ours,” he said.\n\nIt’s here where the concept of Buttercoin, and other marketplaces, as a foundation comes into play. On top is Buttercoin’s target demographic, the payment processors, bitcoin wallets and mining groups – as well as businesses that are more universal in their market approach.\n\nLastly, there are more mainstream payment processors, those who have recently sought partnerships with businesses in the second tier like PayPal or Stripe.\n\nBut, while in the US the top two layers are already developing, Dahl argues the first layer has been hampered by a variety of factors, leading US businesses to turn to overseas exchanges such as Bitstamp, which most recently suffered a $5m hack that analysts suggest could have been worse.\n\n“If you think about the ecosystem in these three layers, then everyone is dependant on marketplaces and there is no good marketplace in the US,” he said. “What that means is if you’re a bitcoin wallet or a merchant processor, you’re going to have to wait weeks to turn bitcoin into cash or cash into bitcoin.”\n\nBy contrast, he said Buttercoin can reduce this timeline to days, removing yet another pain point for its customers.\n\nProof of work\n\nWhile Buttercoin will clearly attract interest by providing a stable place to buy and sell bitcoin, it remains unclear just how the company will be affected by the larger questions that still hang over the US sector of the industry.\n\nThough he doesn’t use the same term to describe Buttercoin, he does view the platform as being a competitor to the international bitcoin exchanges that currently serve US entities. Dahl also declined to talk about regulation, an issue that has emerged as one of the major topics of discussion in the industry.\n\nStill, there is evidence Dahl’s interpretation of the bitcoin ecosystem is finding favor with customers. Bitcoin processing giant BitPay and distributed mining company MegaBigPower, for example, have been vocal about their use of the platform.\n\nThe development, as well as what Dahl claims is the steady growth the company is seeing, lead him to be confident that, at a time when his competitors are struggling, Buttercoin has found the right combination to thrive in a difficult market.\n\n“Very few companies have figured out how to make this work, and those that have don’t really have a lot of incentive to to enable other people to use what they built,” he said. “Not only have we built something that works, but we have the right incentive position to let everybody build on top of us.”\n\nFor the time being, however, Buttercoin’s focus will be on the kind of slow growth that it hopes will encourage the wider development of the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n“Right now, we’re just happy doing what we can to make sure we have healthy volume on the system and over time,” Dahl concluded.\n\nCedric Dahl image via GitHub; Featured image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

01/13/2015,"['The bitcoin price has plunged below $250 and appears to be falling further, as sell orders pile up at major exchanges.\n\nThe price opened the day at $267.08, but quickly fell after just two hours of trading. Soon after 3am (GMT), the price plunged through the $250 mark, which market watchers see as an important psychological barrier for the price.\n\nThe price held steady, but then plunged again about seven hours later, at around 10am. The price then fell about $14 to fall under the $230 mark, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. At press time, it stood at $226.\n\nMarket-watchers have previously warned that if the price falls below $250, then further losses could be in the offing.\n\nArthur Hayes of derivatives firm BitMEX, writing in his weekly trading newsletter yesterday, offered that $200 was the next resistance level after $250.\n\n""If you were hoping for a violent rebound, that hasn\'t happened and it is time to move net-short [BTC],"" Hayes wrote.\n\nOrder books showing large sell orders\n\nOrder books at the major USD/BTC exchanges today are showing a spike in volume, largely from sell orders.\n\nBitfinex, the largest USD exchange by trading volume, shows sells dominating the order book, comprising 70% of total volume over the past hour, at 10:55am. Sell orders have comprised 64% of the Bitfinex order book over the last 24 hours.\n\nShort swaps on Bitfinex have also spiked several times today, hitting a high of 70.5% of the active hourly swaps at around 2am. Current hourly swap activity is in favour of longs, which account for 74% of the instrument.\n\nAt recently revived Bitstamp, which had been offline for four days following a security breach and theft of $5m, selling pressure is piling up. The depth chart it offers shows a sharp increase in the quantity of sell orders of around 1,000 coins around the $244 mark. Hundreds of coins are joining the queue at current prices of around $231.\n\nOKCoin, usually behind Bitfinex and Bitstamp in the amount of bitcoin-dollar trade done, is reporting consistent selling pressure. The price fell about $4 over 45 minutes, with 1,556 coins changing hands from 10am.\n\nAs bitcoin investors on the US east coast start their day to a sea of red candlesticks and a price that has lost more than $30 overnight, a further cascade of selling pressure may hit exchange order books.\n\nMiners pull the plug\n\nThe plummeting price of bitcoin has had ripple effects throughout the bitcoin economy. While traders may be scrambling to top-up their margin accounts or to pile on the short swaps, some miners are apparently beginning to find their positions untenable as well.\n\nCloud mining outfit CEX.io, for one, said it would temporarily suspend mining because the price had fallen too low. Mining difficulty, meanwhile, has plateaued and dipped over the past 30 days, but remains at an all-time high.\n\n""[This is] the result of cloud mining costs exceeding mining profit,"" CEX.io chief information officer Jeffrey Smith wrote in a blog post announcing the suspension yesterday.\n\nSo how far more does the bitcoin price have to drop? As yesterday\'s Markets Weekly noted, several observers think it could go well below $200, after it has plunged past $250.\n\nMartin Tillier of the Nasdaq\'s trading blog believes bitcoin\'s fair value lies somewhere in the $140 region, at a slight premium to the level it was trading at, around $120, before the bull-run in the autumn of 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin believers looking at a bitcoin price apparently in free-fall, might be left to reassure themselves that it\'s the underlying technology, not just the currency price, that matters most.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'When Bitcoin first launched, there was a great deal of interest in the digital currency. Bitcoin investors were all over the news, talking about the virtual pot of gold they saw in Bitcoin, and encouraging everyone else to get on board. It seems that, perhaps not shockingly, this was bad advice. Bitcoin has seen its value collapse over the last few months, and in this article, Australian professor David Glance explains some of the fundamental flaws of the Bitcoin model. – FD\n\nBitcoin’s continuing price fall unmasks its underlying flaws. Is this its end?\n\nBy David Glance, University of Western Australia\n\nBitcoin was dubbed the worst investment of 2014. As predicted however, 2015 has seen the continued fall in value of the currency that was supposed to fuel the digital age. In the last 10 days alone, it has lost 26% in value.\n\nIf 2014 was a bad year for the digital currency, 2015 looks like it will be even worse. Barely days into the year, UK-based Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp was “hacked” and 19,000 Bitcoin stolen. At the time, this loss was valued at US $5 million. Bitstamp has since come back online, with revamped security from BitGo. It may however, all be a bit too late.\n\nHacks of Bitcoin exchanges have come to characterise the Bitcoin world. It isn’t something that is necessarily inherent in Bitcoin itself, but more of a feature of the types of companies that have sprung up around the troubled technology. At best, the hack of one-time leading Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, was a result of sloppy coding and business practices. At worst, it was an inside job, defrauding its customers of $487 million.\n\nA more ominous problem has cast its shadow on the future of Bitcoin. Bitcoin relies on people to engage in “mining” to validate every exchange of the virtual currency. Miners, do some agreed calculations, and if they are fast, or lucky, enough, will succeed in winning some newly produced Bitcoin in exchange for adding the transaction onto the Bitcoin ledger called the Blockchain.\n\nThe strategy of mining has become Bitcoin’s achilles’ heel. The design of Bitcoin dictates that the difficulty of mining will increase as more Bitcoins are produced and more miners get involved. This has led to mining being dominated by companies that can scale to the point where they can guarantee to earn a certain percentage of Bitcoins created each day. As Bitcoin’s value has dropped, the economics of the mining operation have changed, to the point that mining ceases to be economically viable.\n\nCloud mining company CEX.io suspended their mining operations this week, declaring that it needed the price of Bitcoin to be at least $320 before it would be able to resume its operations. Unfortunately for them, the price has dropped even further since and the likelihood of it climbing back to $320 seems slim.\n\nAnother mining company, CoinTerra, is being sued by a data centre provider for $5.4 million for unpaid fees. The cost of power alone to run CoinTerra’s services was $12,000 a day.\n\nThe underlying protocol of Bitcoin does allow for the relative difficulty of mining to be eased if it becomes to hard for miners to stay in operation. In fact, this happened last month for the first time since 2012. It could theoretically continue to become easier as the Bitcoin price drops. The issue is however, that this wasn’t supposed to happen. Bitcoin’s price was supposed to keep increasing as more Bitcoins came onto the market.\n\nBitcoins value relies purely on the belief of the people who buy and sell it. There is no central bank or government around to support it in the case of its value crashing to zero. Once that belief is questioned, Bitcoin becomes unsustainable. Even if the price of Bitcoin doesn’t go to zero, the chances the Bitcoin community convincing the wider public, governments, and industry that Bitcoin really represents the future of the world’s digital economy will become extremely unlikely.\n\nFor the time being, Bitcoin still has enough devotees who believe that the currency will eventually recover and still claim the crown as the future enabler of all digital commerce. However, even they are having their doubts that this grand technological experiment may have run its course.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.\n\nRead the original article.', ""[Update: The number of blocked sites now totals seven. One of these sites is reported to be bitcoinconf.ru]\n\nThe Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications (Roskomnadzor in Russian) has blacklisted five Bitcoin-related websites.\n\nRoskomnadzor has effectively blocked access to Bitcoin.org – an online community of cryptocurrency users and specialists supported by the Bitcoin Foundation - entering it into a registry of prohibited websites despite the site not having any user-submitted content.\n\nUpon accessing Bitcoin.org, users have been receiving the following:\n\n-- Access Denied. Access to the requested resource was blocked in accordance with the current law of the Russian Federation. Please contact us if the specified resource was blocked erroneously.\n\nInformation about the newly imposed ban was announced on January 13 on the official website of Roskomnadzor. The following screenshot was posted on Tjournal.ru:\n\nThe other sites affected by the move include:\n\nBitcoin.it (wiki-encyclopedia dedicated to Bitcoin)\n\nBtcsec.com (online Russian BTC community)\n\nCoinspot.io (online Russian BTC community)\n\nIndacoin.com (Bitcoin exchange)\n\nHasbitcoin.ru\n\nBitcoinconf.ru\n\nThe reason for why these specific websites (and not others) were targeted has not yet been revealed. The popular Bitcoin.org website contains information on the benefits of Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies as a whole) and methods for using the cryptocurrency by both individuals and companies, including links to the other related online communities.\n\nThus, the move was not entirely unexpected as CoinTelegraph reported back in August that the Russian government was planning to clamp down and “restrict access to information sources, which produce Bitcoin and carry operations with their use, with the establishment of appropriate administrative sanctions.”\n\nHowever, Roskomnadzor press secretary Vadim Ampelonskyi did confirm to Tjournal that the Bitcoin websites were blocked in accordance with the ruling of the Neviyanskyi Municipal Court of Sverdlovsk Oblast, but did not share any further details.\n\nCCFR (Cryptocurrency Foundation Russia) Chairman, Igor Chepkasov, commented on the news to CoinTelegraph via email:\n\n“Given the remoteness of the [the Ural, Sverdlovsk region] region and the ‘features’ of the court decision enforcement (issued on September 30 and entered into the registry of blocked sites only on January 13), we can safely say that this is a dress rehearsal for the Prohibition of Bitcoin in Russia. “Furthermore, the owners of these sites never received any advanced notice or official letters from government and regulatory agencies (including a list of claims and recommendations). Also, none of these websites were ever summoned to court. We see that the Russian Bitcoin community is facing judicial arbitrariness and telephone justice at the state level. “Now that Bitcoin enthusiasts and entrepreneurs are faced with real restrictions, we can see how the Russian Bitcoin community is organized and whether it is ready to fight for their rights. “On behalf CCFR I urge all enthusiasts to unite and fight for their rights. I appeal to the victims and notify you that we are ready to provide them with all possible support - consulting, legal and other.”\n\nBack in December, CoinTelegraph reported that Russia was expected to fine cryptocurrency users up to 1 million rubles. Because of concerns that the cryptocurrency facilitates crime, Russian officials have threatened to use legal action against miners and anyone who converts the currency into “real money.”\n\nSince Bitcoin provides a certain level of privacy, government officials believe it could facilitate illegal activity—like online drug purchases and money laundering. And given the cryptocurrency's volatility, banning it would only protect consumers, officials argue.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The app, which has been downloaded 150 times in the last month, is available worldwide (except China) but as it works alongside the terminal it is only fully functional in Germany.\n\nThe terminal software processes payments via payments processor BitPay, which immediately converts bitcoin into fiat currency to address merchants\' concerns about price volatility.\n\n\'No brainer\' for merchants\n\nRicardo Ferrer Rivero, creator of the terminal, said he was prompted to create the device after noticing the lack of low-cost bitcoin payment solutions available in the country.\n\n""It\'s a no-brainer,"" he said. ""If you offer a merchant the possibility to accept payments without a fee and still have the benefits of electronic payments without using cash, it would be hard for them to say no.""\n\nAlthough initially met with varying levels of scepticism, the project has grown in popularity. A total of 50 establishments have already agreed to accept bitcoin using the PEY terminal and a dozen retailers already have their own terminals up and running in store.\n\nPlans to charge for the service are on hold until information surfaces about the service\'s in-market performance.\n\nWhen asked about his business plan, Rivero said that ""bitcoin payments do not currently make up a large part of the shop\'s revenue so we will have to wait for the market to develop before we assess how to proceed"".\n\nHow it works\n\nThe terminal integrates secondhand Google Nexus 7 mobile phones with a 3D-printed case that can easily be placed on a merchant\'s counter.\n\nPEY uses iBeacon technology so that users who have the app installed on their Android phone or iPhone will receive a push notification informing them that a local retailer accepts bitcoin payments. As the PEY app communicates directly with the PEY terminal, users are spared from having to search through various pages of apps to find their bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe app uses NFC (Near Field Communication) to transmit the information if their phone offers that technology. Alternatively, users can simply scan the QR code generated by BitPay in order to complete the transaction.\n\nUsers without the PEY app can use the QR code to pay via any other mobile wallet.\n\nThe prototype version of the PEY terminal is currently based on Android phone, but Rivero hopes to be able to replace it with a Raspberry Pi in the upcoming version.\n\nAlthough current adoption figures indicate a reasonable amount of success, Rivero insists that improving the app is an ongoing project and that new features are due to appear in the near future.\n\nHe said:\n\n""We are including a map of all [merchant] locations and are working on streamlining the invoicing process so that it can be paperless.""\n\nBitcoin schemes on the rise\n\nAlthough it is a pioneering service in Germany, PEY\'s launch comes after a series of similar local schemes launched in the Netherlands and United States.\n\nAmsterdam-based BitStraat and BitPay teamed up last November to give away free 100 bitcoin payment terminals across the Dutch capital city.\n\nAnd in the San Francisco area, bitcoin payment solutions provider snapCard launched its ""#IntegrateSF"" campaign among 500 merchants in October.\n\n""We love to see our users come up with innovative ways to use our technology.""said Wouter Vonk, BitPay European marketing manager of Rivero\'s offering.

Bitcoin is an application that runs on the Blockchain, which is ultimately a more interesting and profound innovation.\n\nThe Blockchain is a secure transaction ledger database that is shared by all parties participating in an established, distributed network of computers. It records and stores every transaction that occurs in the network, essentially eliminating the need for “trusted” third parties such as payment processors. Blockchain proponents often describe the innovation as a “transfer of trust in a trustless world,” referring to the fact that the entities participating in a transaction are not necessarily known to each other yet they exchange value with surety and no third-party validation. For this reason, the Blockchain is a potential game changer.\n\nIn 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or group of people credited with developing bitcoin, released a whitepaper describing the software protocol. Since then, the network has grown and bitcoin\n\nhas become a recognized unit of value around the globe. Bitcoin is extremely important because it provides a mechanism for accessing the Blockchain – but it’s not the only application that can leverage the platform.\n\nBitcoin has also been on the receiving end of some bad press, such as around the collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange earlier last year. The Mt. Gox story is not necessarily an indictment of bitcoin. For the purposes of this post, simply remember this: bitcoin is just a mechanism for transacting on the Blockchain and the Blockchain is the key innovation.\n\nThe Blockchain: Trustworthy Transactions in a Trustless World\n\nThe Blockchain enables the anonymous exchange of digital assets, such as bitcoin, but it is not technically dependent on bitcoin. The elegance of the Blockchain is that it obviates the need for a central authority to verify trust and the transfer of value. It transfers power and control from large entities to the many, enabling safe, fast, cheaper transactions despite the fact that we may not know the entities we are dealing with.\n\nThe mechanics of the Blockchain are novel and highly disruptive. As people transact in a Blockchain ecosystem, a public record of all transactions is automatically created. Computers verify each transaction with sophisticated algorithms to confirm the transfer of value and create a historical ledger of all activity. The computers that form the network that are processing the transactions are located throughout the world and importantly are not owned or controlled by any single entity. The process is real-time, and much more secure than relying on a central authority to verify a transaction.\n\nThere are many analogous concepts both ancient and modern. Technology has and will continue to transfer power and control from central authorities and distribute them to the masses. For example, time used to be determined and communicated by large clock towers that were expensive to build and maintain. Engineering innovations ultimately decentralized the quantification of time to the individual. Likewise, WhatsApp, a popular cross platform messaging app, cut the transaction cost of sending messages globally – and cut profits for the carriers. The central authority (phone carriers) lost to the application (WhatsApp) built on a decentralized network (i.e. the Internet).\n\nSimilarly, third parties that currently verify transactions (the central authority) stand to lose against the Blockchain (the decentralized network). As such, the Blockchain essentially disintermediates these third-party transaction verifiers: auditors, legal services, payment processors, brokerages and other similar organizations.\n\nWhile you may not be convinced that exchanging bitcoin is an invaluable service, there are many other examples of value transfer that are critical – and currently very slow and expensive. Consider the exchange of property: numerous intermediaries are currently involved in this process, such as a third-party escrow service that works for both parties to ensure a smooth transfer. The escrow service, like other services built solely on trust and verification, collect fees that would be mitigated by performing the transaction on the Blockchain – as would wire transfer fees, third party financial auditing, contract execution, etc.\n\nThe use case of the Blockchain enabling a decentralized currency exchange – such as bitcoin – is well defined and will likely be the dominant use case near term, however there are a multitude of innovative and disruptive use cases. Companies are already building their own Blockchains for various applications such as Gridcoin that leverages the Blockchain to crowdsource scientific computing projects. Gridcoin uses its own protocols that require much less computing power and electricity to manage than traditional bitcoin networks.\n\nThe Blockchain: and Why it Matters (Let’s Not Mess it Up)\n\nAuthors Mohit Kaushal Former Brookings Expert Partner, Aberdare Ventures S Sheel Tyle Technology Venture Capitalist\n\nThe Blockchain is a foundational technology, like TCP/IP, which enables the Internet. And much like the Internet in the late 1990s, we don’t know exactly how the Blockchain will evolve, but evolve it will.\n\nSimilar to the Internet, the Blockchain must also be allowed to grow unencumbered. This will require careful handling that recognizes the difference between the platform and the applications that run on it. TCP/IP empowers numerous financial applications that are regulated, but TCP/IP is not regulated as a financial instrument. The Blockchain should receive similar consideration. While the predominant use case for the Blockchain today is bitcoin currency exchange that may require regulation, this will change over time.\n\nHad we over-regulated the Internet early on, we would have missed out on many innovations that we can’t imagine living without today. The same is true for the Blockchain. Disruptive technologies rarely fit neatly into existing regulatory considerations, but rigid regulatory frameworks have repeatedly stifled innovation. It’s likely that innovations in the Blockchain will outpace policy, let’s not slow it down.\n\nNew TechTank Blog Posts Are Available Here', 'Following the tour de force made by an Ukranian startup that converted thousands of regular ATM into Bitcoin ATMs, a Spanish startup used the same procedure to convert 10,000 ATM across Spain.\n\nSmart-Thinking\n\nOne wise entrepreneur once said: “Why should we reinvent the wheel?”\n\nThis consideration is fully integrated in Bit2Me‘s culture, so that they didn’t spend a lot of money to build Bitcoin ATMs from scratch.\n\nInstead, Bit2Me exploited for Hal-Cash ATMs, which are revolutionary in themselves.

Fraud, in the form of chargebacks.\n\nIn a credit card chargeback, a credit-card paying customer asks the issuing bank (the bank that gave them the card) to reverse a transaction made with a merchant.\n\nThis can happen for a variety of legitimate reasons. A merchant may not have delivered the promised goods or service, or it may have been faulty. In some cases, a card may have been stolen and used without the owner’s consent.\n\nSometimes, however, the owner of the card perpetrates their own fraud, by trying to reverse a legitimate financial transaction. It’s effectively a pre-blockchain version of double spending. This can happen a lot on the Internet, where companies are dealing with large numbers of unknown customers half a world away.\n\nChargeback target\n\nThis happened to Joey Rich, who found himself at the wrong end of a steep learning curve in 2010.\n\nHaving purchased some coins, he began selling them at a profit. He lost his initial investment of $9,000, though, after his bitcoin exchange, BuyBitcoins.com, suffered a series of chargebacks from stolen credit cards.\n\nHe explained that a combination of lost credit card revenues and chargeback fees led to a loss of his funds.\n\nRich said:\n\n“For chargebacks, credit card companies charge fees of $25 to $35 in addition to the reversal of the original payment as a deterrent. So I also got hit with a huge number of those $35 fees, which is especially painful on orders of $5 to $10. As my my bank account went into the red, I started getting hit with overdraft fees as well, so it was quite a fiasco.”\n\nAside from the lost revenues, one of the nasty side effects of chargebacks is that credit card processors keep score. Too many chargebacks raises flags against your account. Eventually, his account was terminated, and Rich was added to a blacklist.\n\n“I didn\'t really know anything about credit card processing back then, and didn\'t understand how reversible those payments are,” he admitted.\n\nTo make matters worse, he explained that the credit card processor hadn’t deposited the original $9,000 into his account in the first place, due to an administrative error. That didn’t stop them withdrawing $7,000 in chargeback transactions and fees, though, putting him in deficit and incurring even more charges in the form of overdraft fees.\n\nIt took him a year to sort it out and limp away with some money. In the interim, he had closed the exchange down while he figured out a way to handle credit cards more effectively.\n\nIn 2012, Rich reopened the site, this time with identity verification features, including options for users to upload a scan of their driver\'s license, to log in with their Facebook account, and to be geolocated using HTML5 in the browser (which he claimed is far better than geolocation by IP address).\n\nSuccessful completion of all these tasks contributed to a trust score, which would help to decide whether a user’s order was processed or not.\n\nAt this point, Rich was using a different credit card processor.\n\nHe said:\n\n“Those identity verification requirements helped me to do much better, and I reached about $45,000 in sales in the month of May 2013. However, about $4,500 of those were charged back, resulting in the termination of that account.”\n\nThe chargeback minefield\n\nClearly, credit card processing for merchants is harder than it looks. The rewards are ease and convenience, though, and depending on the customer demographic, are simply too tempting for some exchanges to resist.\n\nCEX.io will happily take your credit card payments in exchange for bitcoin, confirms CIO Jeffrey Smith.\n\n“Credit card transactions are the fastest and most popular mean of payment. In order to go mainstream, an exchange has to have a credit or debit card deposit/withdraw option, among other payment methods,” he said.\n\nThe processing fees for credit cards makes them financially suitable for transactions up to $1,000, Smith indicated. After that, other mechanisms may be preferable. Wire bank transfers are good for larger amounts, but the process may take up to 10 days, he said, making it less than ideal for shorter-term investments.\n\nSmith claims that the firm has lost no money at all on chargebacks. “We avoid chargebacks by working only with the credit or debit card providers who use 3D Secure. This layer of security enables us to reduce risks of chargebacks,” he explained.\n\n3D Secure, which readers may know as \'Verified by Visa\' or MasterCard SecureCode, requires a form of identification by the issuer, in addition to the merchant.\n\nAlternative methods\n\nOthers are less trusting. One exchange CEO, who preferred not to be named, said that his demographic made it acceptable not to accept credit cards.\n\n“When you’re dealing solely with SWIFT wire transfers, as we do right now, one of the biggest benefits is that they’re irreversible. Fraud isn’t one of our worries. Something like that is more attractive to a more B2B business-focused exchange like us.”\n\nBurned by his credit card experiences, Rich now has another method of taking payments for bitcoin: PayPal. Customers paying via that service are now sent ‘bitcoin gift cards’, which are effectively paper wallets that he sends out by mail.\n\nHe said:\n\n“I left the identity verification features in, but made them less important, since security lies mainly in physical delivery of the cards. I have been accepting an average of around $3,000 in sales per month, and have not lost any money to chargebacks yet. However, I refund quite a few payments that either look suspicious or are delivered to an address where they are never redeemed.”\n\nRich delivers the service, started in August 2014, through his BitcoinGiftCard.org site. The PayPal service costs about 4% in fees, which is ""irritating"", he said, as it’s higher than those asked by the credit card companies.\n\nPassing on the risk\n\nAnother site, Brawker, has an ingenious solution for avoiding chargeback fraud: let conventional ecommerce players deal with it. Cyril Houri, who founded the site a few months ago, explained that it matches people wanting to buy bitcoin with those wanting to spend their bitcoin through non-bitcoin merchants online (see CoinDesk\'s review of the service here).\n\nIf Bob wants to buy a $200 DVD player from Amazon, but wants to pay for it in bitcoin, then he can publish that fact on Brawker. If Alice wants to buy $200-worth of bitcoin, she can bid for that order. If her bid is accepted, she then buys the goods in fiat currency, giving Bob’s address. Bob then sends the bitcoin to Alice after she sends him proof of purchase.\n\nIt’s effectively an exchange order book built atop online sales of other products.\n\nThe upside of this model is that the ecommerce provider handles any chargeback issues. If Alice decides to declare a chargeback on the DVD player, that’ll be Amazon’s problem (or Best Buy’s, or John Lewis’s, or whichever merchant is being used).\n\nHouri’s company doesn’t even have a credit card merchant account. It has a bank account to pay expenses, but that’s it.\n\n“You have the benefit of using the ecommerce infrastructure,” he said, arguing that the delivery of physical goods via ecommerce is often faster online than sending money via traditional methods. “Being able to piggyback on that makes it as convenient as possible.”\n\nThere is some inconvenience, though. Alice can only buy bitcoins in the quantity that Bob – or anyone else on the other side of the order book – wants to spend them. That makes it hard to buy exactly the number of bitcoins that she wants.\n\nHouri said:\n\n“With traditional exchanges, the commodity at the other end is fungible. In our case the commodity is a physical good. It’s someone who wanted to buy a hat, and in the other end it’s someone that is prepared to buy that hat’s value in bitcoin.”\n\nEven Brawker is exploring stronger client verification, though. After all, any form of taking Internet payments is an exercise in risk. The more than you can decrease the risk, the better.\n\nCredit cards may have their advantages when it comes to bitcoin purchases, but they also have their drawbacks. What’s interesting is how entrepreneurs try to route their way around them. On the Internet, it’s innovation that abhors a vacuum.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, CoinDesk.\n\nCredit card image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It is instead run on a lesser-known anonymizing network called the Invisible Internet Project, or “I2P” for short. I2P was released in 2003 and, unlike Tor, its developers are pseudonymous and they don't appear to be funded by a state.\n\nSecond, whereas previous Silk Roads accepted only Bitcoin for payment, SRR uses a wallet that supports multiple cryptocurrencies like Anoncoin, Darkcoin and Dogecoin. The wallet converts these currencies to Bitcoin and then delivers them to the user's account balance for shopping.\n\nWhat's Good for Conversion Is Good for Bitcoin\n\nUsers wishing to pay in an altcoin on SRR are charged 1%. This minor loss in purchasing power incentivizes users to pay directly in Bitcoin, but also enables those who wish to use more anonymous currencies to do so.\n\nA screenshot found of SRR's store (populated only with sample products) shows that the marketplace functions with all the same safeguards as other successful markets: product ratings, seller reputations and product feedback sections.\n\nThe sample offerings may now be replaced with the real stuff. The site announced on January 11:\n\n“Sample data is being removed. Current vendor(s) your products will show shortly. Thank you all for making the site launch a success!”\n\nA Marketplace Regulated by Philosophy?\n\nNoticeably missing from SRR's offerings—as opposed to other Silk Roads—is credit card data. You know, the kind used to drain strangers' accounts of their fiat.\n\nAnd credit card data may never be available on the site, as it's possible that the philosophy of the site's founders simply won't allow for it. The site reads:\n\n“We created this to allow the most basic of human activities to occur unimpeded, that being trade. It's not only a major disruption of progress but, it is an interference to control someone to the degree that their free will is compromised. We may not be able to stop this but, we certainly won't contribute to it.”\n\nAnd theft of credit card funds certainly isn't trade, is it?\n\nTor vs. I2P\n\nIf SRR turns out to be a secure shopping experience, this may cause other free markets to move away from Tor and onto I2P. Many security vulnerabilities have recently been discovered in Tor, and users are always eager for a network upgrade.\n\nHave you visited Silk Road Reloaded yet? Or what about I2P—have you tried it?

01/14/2015,"['For years, Bitcoin has been the Silk Road\'s biggest strength. Escrow wallets let money change hands safely and easily, bitcoin tumblers let users keep drug transactions at arm\'s length, and, for a while at least, it kept everyone off the radar of law enforcement. In return, the Silk Road gave Bitcoin its first major infusion of die-hard users, a base that would drive the currency higher and higher.\n\nThe so-called ""prosecution futures"" are coming due\n\nBut now, as Ross Ulbricht defends himself against charges of running the Silk Road and profiting from drug transactions, Bitcoin may be the single biggest problem for his defense. The same features that made Silk Road possible have now turned against him, and casual observers are realizing that Bitcoin isn’t as anonymous as they thought. The public Bitcoin ledger details Ulbricht\'s enormous financial holdings and a wealth of potentially incriminating transactions. Now that his wallet address has been discovered, the perfect anonymity tool has turned into the perfect source of evidence. Skeptics sometimes called the currency ""prosecution futures,"" and now it looks like some of those futures are coming due.\n\nThe problem is coming into focus because of new details about Ulbricht’s defense strategy, made clear in yesterday’s opening statement. The defense is admitting from the outset that Ulbricht created the Silk Road and ran it for the early months, a bold tactic that many are concerned may backfire. Instead of claiming a full mistaken identity, the defense is simply claiming Ulbricht didn\'t profit from the drug trade that happened on the Silk Road, having already handed off the site to an unnamed accomplice. As lead defense attorney Joshua Dratel put it in his opening statement yesterday, ""the real Dread Pirate Roberts is still out there.""\n\n""Bitcoin is insanely traceable.""\n\nAs a result, all the prosecution has to do is prove Ulbricht was profiting off the Silk Road\'s drug transactions — something that Bitcoin\'s public blockchain makes it easy to do. Every Bitcoin transaction is publicly recorded in the collective blockchain, giving researchers an easy view of how much is in any account at a given time. ""Bitcoin is insanely traceable,"" says Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at UC Berkeley\'s International Computer Science Institute. ""The Silk Road bitcoins are well known, not just the ones seized but the entire cloud of Bitcoins. Add in the known purchases from law enforcement, and it becomes downright trivial to create the ""history cluster"" that is Silk Road."" This kind of tracing has become a popular subject for Bitcoin-minded academics, and with access to the Silk Road\'s server logs, there should be plenty of evidence connecting Silk Road transactions to Ulbricht\'s personal wallet, which was seized as part of the initial raid. That\'s not the same as convincing a jury, but it\'s likely to cause serious problems for Ulbricht\'s defense in the very near future.\n\nBlockchain problems have also cropped up in the defense\'s treatment of the $28 million found in Ulbricht\'s Bitcoin wallet. The defense is claiming it was simply currency-trading revenue, created by the astronomical rise in the value of Bitcoin over the period in question — but the blockchain makes it easy to check that claim. Prosecutors can easily see all the transactions that wallet made. ""Making the claim that this was revenue from trading is a very dangerous claim to make,"" says Weaver. ""The defense attorney better hope Ulbricht really was a brilliant Bitcoin trader, because that defense is easy to shred otherwise."" If Ulbricht really did control 144,000 bitcoin in 2011, that money would show up in the wallets he controlled at the time. If the money can\'t be found, it suggests the currency-trading story isn\'t much more than hot air.\n\n""The defense attorney better hope Ulbricht really was a brilliant Bitcoin trader, because that defense is easy to shred otherwise.""\n\nIronically, it would have been much easier to conceal these assets in the traditional financial system. Conventional money laundering is still an enormous headache for prosecutors, and subpoenaing the transaction records for an offshore bank is much harder than simply checking the blockchain. Even earlier cryptocurrencies like Liberty Reserve would have made it harder to trace money as it flowed through the system. It also would have been harder to seize. As long as law enforcement doesn\'t know about a given stash, that money can also be used to pay associates under the table, an extremely common tactic for evading organized crime prosecutions. But as far as we can tell, Ulbricht didn\'t get any of those benefits. Police seized Ulbricht\'s Bitcoin wallet along with his laptop, and he\'s since filed a forfeiture motion admitting that all the bitcoins were his. It might be the simplest $28 million seizure the FBI has ever made.\n\nAll these issues stem from a misunderstanding of Bitcoin itself. The service isn\'t technically anonymous: it\'s pseudonymous. Each wallet has a hard and persistent identity and a wealth of data associated with that identity. If you don\'t know who\'s behind a given wallet, that looks a lot like anonymity, but once a person is tied to a given wallet, their financial activity becomes instantly and painfully public. That feature has been important in the past, most notably in the aftermath of the Mt. Gox theft, but it\'s never played out as publicly as it did in the Ulbricht case.\n\nIt\'s a realization that\'s already sending shockwaves through the bitcoin world. The exchange rate has plummeted in the hours since Ulbricht\'s defense attorney spoke, falling under $200 for the first time in more than a year. It\'s hard to say for sure that the drop is connected, and in the long term, it may well be good news for the currency, driving out criminal activity in favor of more innovative uses. Still, as the currency\'s most infamous customer stands trial, the world is less sure of bitcoin than its ever been.', 'The price of bitcoin is continuing to crash, dropping as low as $173 early Wednesday, according to stats from CoinDesk. It is down from about $244 just a day before, a drop of nearly 30%.\n\nSome people are beginning to worry that bitcoin is stuck in a self-reinforcing negative price cycle in which bitcoin hoarders are being forced to sell bitcoin to meet their dollar-based costs, and the excess supply of bitcoin cheapens its price — which makes dollar costs and debts even more ""expensive"" for bitcoin holders.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price continued to fluctuate at about $195.\n\nThe virtual currency is looking increasingly beleaguered, and its price had been dropping steadily in recent months. At the start of 2014, bitcoin was trading at as much as $1,000 a coin. Today\'s value is just a fifth of that. Here\'s a longer-term chart:\n\nJust Tuesday, the currency broke down through the $250 barrier for the first time since November 2013, prompting worries over further drops. The effects of the crash are already being felt, with one cloud mining service forced to temporarily halt operations because its service was no longer profitable because of the low price.\n\nCoinDesk speculated on Jan. 6 that short-selling might be responsible for the recent drop. However, TradeBlock\'s Greg Schvey suggested to The New York Times that the market might be trapped in a vicious downward spiral: Mining operations and other cryptocurrency services ""have very real fiat-based liabilities that they have to pony up for, and to do that, they\'re going to have to sell bitcoins."" This drives the price down, leaving their coins less valuable and forcing them to sell even more.\n\nThere has also been a slew of bad news and regulatory woes for bitcoin recently. Earlier this month, the news broke that the bitcoin exchange Bitstamp had been targeted by hackers, who managed to steal $5 million in the virtual currency. It is a reminder of the security issues that face any virtual currency seeking mainstream adoption, and it brings back memories of the infamous exchange Mt. Gox. Responsible at its peak for 70% of all bitcoin transactions, it shuttered in February 2014, with $450 million in bitcoin missing.\n\nCombined with bitcoin\'s reputation as an enabler for criminal activity, it is likely this public-image problem is hindering mainstream adoption. As one commenter on the discussion board Hacker News remarks, bitcoin is an ""even worse"" investment than gold, because ""normal people at least have a decent idea of when their gold is secure. A non-techie just has to trust that the online bitcoin provider or author of the wallet is doing what he/she really says and in a secure fashion.""\n\nCoinDesk reports that Nasdaq\'s trading blog predicts the virtual currency will ultimately stabilise at about $140, which is ""a slight premium to the level it was trading at, around $120, before the bull-run in the autumn of 2013.""', 'Following a lengthy silence in the media, CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar has emerged on the offensive, seeking to clarify the current state of his bitcoin mining firm, one that has recently been rocked by questions about its solvency.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk as part of a new interview, Iyengar confirmed that the Austin-based bitcoin mining company is in default, and it is currently awaiting a decision from its secured note holders.\n\nCoinTerra is in default on roughly $4.25m-worth of secured notes, according to Iyengar. The admission comes days after the firm became the target of a lawsuit filed by data center services provider C7 Data Centers. CoinTerra has launched a countersuit, contesting Utah-based C7’s allegations of unjust enrichment and breach of contract.\n\nIyengar asserted that a halt in bitcoin mining at C7’s data centers resulted in a default event for CoinTerra, telling CoinDesk:\n\n“At this point in time, things are kind of frozen. Until the next steps are clear, you know, there’s not a whole lot progress we can make.”\n\nThe CEO declined to offer specifics on a potential deal, citing non-disclosure agreements.\n\nIndications that CoinTerra was experiencing debt problems first emerged earlier this month. Iyengar said in an interview that situation has effectively left CoinTerra ""frozen"" as it pursues solutions with its debt holders.\n\nProblems not anticipated\n\nComplicating the company\'s current situation is that CoinTerra began accepting preorders for its planned 16nm AIRE Miner in September.\n\nIyengar said that at the time CoinTerra didn’t foresee the problems it is currently experiencing today, arguing that his company’s fortunes shifted as the price of bitcoin fell over the course of 2014 and network difficulty climbed.\n\nHe explained:\n\n""Things were going well. We had many different meetings, in terms of investment opportunities and all that, so there was no indication at that time whatsoever that things [would worsen].""\n\nThroughout the interview, Iyengar strived to paint CoinTerra as the victim of larger market forces.\n\n“Who would predict the downfall that bitcoin has taken, in terms of price and difficulty and all that?” he continued. “A lot of things have happened that were not foreseen.”\n\nThe legal complications, as well as the default, have put initiatives such as its next-generation mining ASICs in limbo, and Iyengar said that, like other parts of the business, its too early to suggest how that work might continue.\n\nAwaiting debt decision\n\nWhen asked about CoinTerra’s next move, Iyengar said that there are several factors, including the health and future of the bitcoin network itself, that will play into the final decision made by its debt holders.\n\nUntil then, Iyengar acknowledged, the company’s future remains uncertain.\n\nHe suggested that owners of the company’s debt are likely examining the current price of bitcoin – $182 at the time of writing – as well as any other variables as they weigh the plan put forward by CoinTerra, explaining:\n\n“I’m sure the note holders are looking at everything, the situation in the market. So, it all depends on how they move.”\n\n“It’s hard to predict,” he concluded.\n\nUncertainty visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He jumped into a car and led a chase through Los Angeles, the likes of which had not been seen since O.J. Simpson\'s white Bronco hit the freeways. That morning, Newsweek had reported in a cover story that this man was the elusive inventor of bitcoin, the notorious online currency whose price has seesawed for years between pennies and thousands of dollars apiece.\n\nBut the Japanese man, Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, eventually gave in and told the media the Newsweek report was false. The then-64-year-old, California-trained engineer said, ""I did not create, invent, or otherwise work on bitcoin. I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report.""\n\nAdded his lawyer, Ethan Kirschner: ""Newsweek terrorized Mr. Nakamoto. [The magazine] scared his elderly mother, obtained his email address by deception, and misquoted or invented quotes from both him and his brothers.""\n\nThe chase and its aftermath were perhaps the most dramatic part of an insane year for the cryptocurrency, which has drawn worldwide attention and will be discussed this weekend at the fourth North American bitcoin conference at the Fillmore Miami Beach.\n\nBitcoin was designed to be a digital form of money -- balances are tracked only online; there are no bills or coins you can hold in your hand. It can be used almost anonymously, transferred around the world instantaneously, and moved free from the prying eyes of bankers, regulators, and law enforcement. It\'s been used for good -- sending funds to farmers in remote Africa via cell phone, for instance -- and evil, like money laundering and buying drugs online.\n\nThanks in large part to media hype that had been building around it, bitcoin peaked in November 2013 at $1,216.73, just a few weeks before last year\'s Miami conference was getting underway.\n\nBut after a year in which several hacks, huge thefts, and bitcoin-related crimes illuminated the risks, the price of a bitcoin has fallen to $300. This year\'s conference takes place as two Miami men await trial for bitcoin-related money laundering and just days after a large Slovenian bitcoin exchange was hacked and $5 million worth of the currency stolen.\n\nStill, Moe Levin, a geek-chic 26-year-old in black-frame Buddy Holly eyeglasses who organizes the Miami conference, says all of these problems have only made ""bitcoin superstrong and resilient.""\n\nBorn into an Orthodox Jewish family in Toronto, Levin was sent to study in Israel at age 18. That led to a scholarship in Austria, where he met a Dutch girl, whom he followed to his current home, Amsterdam. He says he\'s a clinical psychologist in Austria and speaks German, Dutch, Hebrew, and Arabic.\n\n""Years ago,"" he explains, as though it has been eons, he got a job organizing supply-chain conferences in Europe. Execs from big companies like Starbucks would attend to scope out new technologies that might save them money.\n\nTo make something as simple as a paper cup, he explains, required multiple vendors.\n\n""Money was changing hands six or seven times, and at every step, the check or wire transfer had to clear. It was especially a problem in countries with shaky banking systems."" At conferences, attendees began to talk about bitcoin as a way to speed things up. When Levin began researching it, he found there was ""actually a huge community"" of people using the currency.\n\nHe discovered that someone named Satoshi Nakamoto (but whose real identity remains uncertain) had proposed the idea of bitcoin in 2008 in an online technology forum. It was designed with open-source software, and all transactions were recorded online. Money was kept in online ""wallets"" like a SkyMiles account.\n\nAmong the first purchases came in 2010, when a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz from Jacksonville, Florida, wanted to see if he could buy goods with bitcoin. He offered 10,000 of them in exchange for two pizzas. A computer user in England agreed, accepted the bitcoin, and had Papa John\'s deliver the pizzas to Hanyecz.\n\nLevin read about all this and started organizing bitcoin conferences in Amsterdam, Chicago, and Miami. (Not because South Florida has a great tech scene but because ""Miami in January is not a hard sell for most people in the world,"" and it\'s a gateway to lots of countries with ""shaky regulatory or banking environments."")\n\nThe conference attendees, businesses that hoped to profit from the currency and entrepreneurs, exchanged knowledge and tips. It grew increasingly popular and drew visitors from as far away as Australia.\n\nThen, in 2013, federal agents arrested Ross Ulbricht, the alleged founder of a murky site called Silk Road that had been used for drug purchases and other criminal activity. They seized 144,336 bitcoins worth millions of dollars. (His trial was scheduled to begin this week in Manhattan.)\n\nLocally, the currency has also been involved in alleged crimes. On December 5, 2013, an undercover Miami Beach Police detective searching for criminals using a website called localbitcoins.com met then-30-year-old Mitchell Espinoza at Nespresso on Lincoln Road, police reports show. Espinoza sold the cop a fraction of a bitcoin for $500, thus making an $83.67 profit, prosecutors say. The detective hinted that he planned to use the bitcoin for illicit purposes.\n\nThe men met a second time, at Häagen-Dazs on South Pointe Drive. A police report shows the detective told Espinoza he needed bitcoin so he could buy ""stolen credit card numbers from Russian sellers... He told Espinoza that he would be willing to trade Espinoza credit card numbers for bitcoin."" Espinoza said he ""would think about it.""', 'The price of Bitcoin has taken bit of a dive over the last couple of days, shedding over 20 percent of its value in the last 24 hours. The sell-off, like other sell-offs and rallies before it, draws a lot of attention and questions about what it means for the future of the technology. Here\'s why I don\'t focus on price much.\n\nBitcoin is best thought of as a 5- to 10-year project, and we\'re at the very early stages. An (admittedly imperfect) analogy is the early Web.\n\nJerry Brito About Jerry Brito is executive director of Coin Center, a non-profit research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C. focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies such as Bitcoin.\n\nLike the early Web, Bitcoin is an open platform that no one owns, and on top of which anyone can build without having to get anyone else\'s permission. And just like the early Web, success requires investors, entrepreneurs, and developers to build out the infrastructure and applications that will make it useful to average users.\n\nThe World Wide Web was conceived by Tim Berners-Lee; he published a paper proposing it in March of 1989. The following year he worked to implement the idea in code, making the first website in December of 1990. The first popular Web browser didn\'t come until 1993 when Marc Andreessen and the team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications released Mosaic. The following year Andreessen started Netscape and released the Netscape Navigator browser in 1994.\n\nThose of us old enough to remember using Navigator to browse the Web over a Winsock connection on a 56k baud modem can attest that it was not the amazing experience we take for granted today. In fact, if you couldn\'t see that the technology would evolve, you would have concluded that it was practically useless. For one thing, there was no easy way to find things on the Web. Well, we didn\'t get Google until 1998.\n\nGoogle is now the most visited website on the planet. Second to it is Facebook, and for many people the Web is virtually synonymous with social networking. Yet Facebook was not founded until 2004–a full 14 years after the Web was first conceived.\n\nSo here\'s the parallel: Bitcoin was conceived by Satoshi Nakamoto and proposed in a paper published in 2008. He worked on implementing the idea into code, mining the first block of the blockchain in January of 2009. So, if we take the Web as a parallel, we\'re at the stage in Bitcoin were we would hope to see a Mosaic level development, not a Facebook.\n\nIn other words, it\'s early days. The Googles and Facebooks of Bitcoin–the killer apps that will make the technology indispensable for ordinary users–may not come for another 5 years.\n\nUnlike the early Web, though, Bitcoin has a price ticker people look at daily, and so they wring their hands. Every dip and spike in the price gets a lot of attention and spells either doom or ""irrational exuberance."" But as Marc Andreessen has pointed out, “the price of domain names didn\'t determine the usefulness of the Internet.”\n\nWith a longer time horizon in mind, you can put the short-term drops and rallies in price of Bitcoin in perspective. So don\'t worry so much.', 'Bitcoin is dead. Bitcoin is dead, cry the critics. Like vultures at a funeral, financial pundits are circling. Each one is vying to print their “I told you, so”‘s before the other – fighting like starving dogs over table scraps.\n\nBenign Parsimony\n\nBitcoin is dead, they say again. Miner’s are shutting down. Services are running off with customer’s coins. Bitcoin is a Ponzi Scheme. The Bitcoin CEO was arrested. Bitcoin is for drugs and money laundering. The price is falling, the price is falling.\n\nHey… Henny Pennying is big business but I don’t picture these individuals as Chicken Littles. To me, they’re a pit of hungry vipers lashing out where ever their gut tells them.\n\n“With Animal Farm in mind, has Bitcoin the asset’s failure thus shone a light on a system which routinely propagandises the benefits of sharing intellectual property for free while rewarding only those who live by entirely different principles?” – Isabella Kaminska, FT Alphaville\n\nMs. Kaminska takes a dozen more wordy paragraphs of five dollar words to say so, but the fundamental flaw in Bitcoin, she claims, is “You’re just too dumb.” Yes, really. Furthermore, she presents dubiously selected excerpts from quotes of Gavin Andresen, mistakes Bitcoin businesses for Bitcoin, and proves she does not understand the underlying technology.\n\nStop listening to what they say and look at what they are doing. Just as our community rallies when the price rises, so does the community of naysayers with each bubble market correction. Our detractors are becoming a metric to gauge the popularity of Bitcoin. With each passing cycle, the numbers grow on both sides. Actually, this is good news.\n\nIgnorance is Not Tied to the Price of a Bitcoin.\n\nNo matter how badly the critics try to frame it that way. To most critics, this technology may as well be magic. Basing their opinion on the price instead of the technology reveals their ignorance. And that is not their fault. Computer Science is a specialized, creative, field. Most users of technology choose to ignore the happenings “under the hood” of their devices and software. That should not deprive them of their opinions of the devices or software.\n\nHowever, to manufacture clamorous opinions and present them to others while maintaining that ignorance is not only irresponsible but insidious – the literal pretense of knowledge and deliberate misinformation.\n\nThe critics sell themselves short. They ignore the nascent technology that grew an $8b market cap. They forget that wealth is a side effect of innovation, a creative process, and anything but finite. Bitcoin the technology is alive, well and here to stay. Bitcoin the price is just a side effect.\n\nHistory Repeats… Repeats… Repeats…\n\nBitcoin is dead and most of us have been here before. The first few times you witness the death of Bitcoin it’s scary. You may cash out coins, you may be ridiculed by your friends, it might even keep you awake at night.\n\nThe next few times you become the evangelist. Perhaps it feels prudent to remind others “The fundamentals are sound” or “Startup money is soaring.” Enjoy the blank stares of confusion when you say, “more transactions are taking place than ever.”\n\nBy double-digits, you are a seasoned professional. This script is just part of the ride.\n\n“Bitcoin is Dead” Anti-Venom\n\nFor example, let’s break apart an argument from the recent media blitz proclaiming “Bitcoin is dead.”\n\nAlphaville blogger, Isabella Kaminska, exposes the “fundamental economic flaw at the heart of every cryptocurrency.”\n\nHere are recent events she gives as indicators, before outright saying it:\n\n“A swathe of cloud mining operators are suspending operations because they’re no longer profitable at current price/hash levels.”\n\nAnd?\n\nThe money transmitter in my old neighborhood went out of business too. Things got hard after everyone stopped using dollars. I hope GoDaddy never goes out of business. Who would register the website domains?\n\nCloud Mining is a service provided by a business entity completely separate from Bitcoin. Their models are, apparently, tied to the price of a bitcoin since that’s what they sell. Bitcoin is not tied to Cloud Mining. Every cloud miner could bankrupt themselves; Bitcoin would not care.\n\n“A real-world data company is suing miner manufacturer Cointerra for delayed payments amounting to $5.4m in potential damages, and there are unconfirmed reports the company is in default to unknown senior debt holders.”\n\nOnly $5.4m? Bitcoin is dead!\n\nSo what? Butterfly Labs faced a $5m lawsuit, and they’re back in business already. BFL was the definition of fraud, customer abuse and how not to run a business. They were raided by the government, had their assets seized, were summoned to court, received death threats, the list continues.\n\nHey, how often are fiat banks held accountable? Maybe the government should have paid all of BFL’s debt with the consumers tax money and further propped up BFL so they could buy the competition and use their new station to do further damage before ultimately failing again.\n\nI ask again, what does this have to do with Bitcoin? People should be allowed to spend their money on the things they want and be free to own the repercusions – good or bad.\n\n“Sources assure us that 2-hour long block times on the blockchain are now a thing, severely undermining claims that Bitcoin is an efficient and robust payment processing alternative.”\n\n– Sources assure me the Sun won’t rise tomorrow. The Earth will shake and the sky will turn green with lemon-yellow polka dots.\n\nIt’s not hard to say anything you want without a citation. No one knows who these sources are, Ms. Kaminska never shares them. Sources say, Bitcoin is dead.\n\nThe truth is Bitcoin is working exactly as intended. Difficulty scales up as new users join the network. It also scales back down after they leave.\n\nThere is a tiny bit of truth to this one, but it’s clear Ms. Kaminska does not understand. Every 2016 blocks (roughly fourteen days) Bitcoin self-audits. It looks back on how many blocks were mined and in what period. It makes an adjustment to difficulty and honey badgers onward.\n\nHowever, if a huge portion of hash rate left, say 80%, and never returned. The network would have to make it to the next difficulty re-targetting before a return to 10-minute block times. With a significantly lowered hash rate, this would take much longer than fourteen days. So far, it’s difficult to gauge the impact, if any, of the miners shutting down.\n\n“A company that promised to double your bitcoins in just 100 hours with sophisticated marketing like this… has surprisingly failed to deliver those bitcoins. With no-one as yet figuring out that the desperate short-term nature of this scam probably represents the fact that those in the know realise and appreciate that the golden goose is about to die, so are rinsing the system while they can.”\n\nYou’re telling me consumers are making bad decisions with their money? Well, good thing fiat dollars make that impossible. No one has ever been conned out of their good ‘ole USD. Regardless, it’s none of your business what risks people take in their investments. If I ran the competition, The Federal Reserve, I would be ashamed that people were fleeing my currency in droves for a chance to make mistakes like these.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Ponzi CryptoDouble Disappears With At Least 2233 Bitcoins\n\nHer golden goose comments will make sense soon. It ties in with the “You’re too stupid” for Bitcoin to work argument.\n\n“High quality[sic] global journalism requires investment.”\n\nIs the note that precedes the copy & paste text from Alphaville’s website. Behold, high-quality journalism:\n\n“Bitcoin’s unofficial CEO Gavin Andresen has publicly declared he is cashing out of Bitcoin and investing in stocks,” – Isabella Kaminska, Alphaville\n\n“Bitcoin is wild and crazy investment that I’m diversifying out of all the time,” he says. “If bitcoin is wildly successful, I’m still holding on to a good chunk of bitcoin. It could be worth tens of millions of dollars, but it could be worth zero. It doesn’t make sense to hold more than that amount. I don’t have a desire to be a multi-billionaire. That’s not what motivates me, I have no desire to be filthy rich.” – Gavin Andresen, Chief Scientist, The Bitcoin Foundation\n\nGive me a break. Using a quote and not providing a full citation is a hack. Oh, but it gives great link back to other “Bitcoin is Dead” sensationalism. “Millionaire with thousands of bitcoins diversifies his portfolio” just doesn’t sound as good as “Bitcoin CEO is publicly cashing out of Bitcoin.” That’s manufactured hype.\n\nPeople are Too Dumb. So Defer to a Government Made of People\n\nIsabella goes on, making six points she believes are positive.\n\n1) Turns out, if you want people to learn about finance and cryptography, it’s darn useful to offer them a financial incentive to do so. (In the real world, that incentive is usually the prospect of getting a good job.)\n\n2) Based on point 1) there are going to be a lot more individuals who know a hefty amount about finance and the strengths of a well managed fiat currency from this experiment. That said, as with any university course, there are still going to be a lot of people on whom the lessons were wasted, and who will undoubtedly have to retake the course in another guise, eventually.\n\n3) An education scheme funded by its users naturally distributes capital to those who understand how the system works (the winners) and away from those who don’t (the losers). If the losers don’t use this experience as a life lesson their money will have been badly spent. One might argue, the winners presumably already had the skills in the first place, and are the equivalent of the teachers/masters who deserve to be rewarded for imparting their knowledge. Nevertheless, it’s still the case that if Biff Tannen’s version of 1985 had an education system, it would probably have looked like this.\n\nReal life naturally rewards its users based on who understands how the system works (winners) and those who don’t (losers). Pssst – Biff Tannen relied on theft, coercion and deception. He was a statist. Bitcoin is voluntary, impartial and transparent. Bitcoin is anarchic.\n\nIsabella has a problem with you going out in the world, learning more than other people, applying it in useful ways and profiting. She assumes that the majority of us will be the biggest idiots left holding the bag. When the price finally plunges below a penny, we will return to fiat with our tail between our legs. The only value we can provide at that point is contributing the knowledge we picked up from Bitcoin to the fiat system.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Price and the Federal Reserve\n\n5) Bitcoin illustrates beautifully that it’s the country and/or civil society system which puts the value into currency, not the currency which puts the value into the system. On that basis, we learn that any system that is resource dependent, badly managed, unproductive and sustains itself only by offering safe harbour to criminals and tax dodgers is unlikely to be sustainable. Apply that logic to Bitcoin, and you quickly realise, if Bitcoin was a country it would be probably be a failed state\n\nAn overpowering organization that forces everyone at gunpoint to move at the pace of the lowest common denominator is a great reason to become a criminal. Good people don’t follow bad laws.\n\nHow convenient that anyone trying to keep the entirety of what they earn are criminals. What Bitcoin offers is the same appeal that pulled people to The New World, The American West – The opportunity to make your own way, work with others to solve your problems, privacy and property.\n\nThe trail to every great frontier is blazed by those seeking freedom from the current establishment. How dangerous are these criminals who peacefully trade with one-another and then refuse to give a portion to third parties that demand it. Does it make someone a criminal if they rather their earnings go towards their family than a foreign war that destroys foreign families?\n\nWhen did it become a sin for me to want to keep what is mine and a virtue for you to covet what you do not have?\n\n“6) With all that in mind, we suggest the true economic benefit of Bitcoin may be its unwitting exposure of the hypocrisy of so-called “revolutionary” open-source systems. All they’ve really allowed us to do is replace old fashioned rubber and oil barons with tech barons happy to exploit the nameless coding workhorses contributing to open source projects for their proprietary business benefit, just as the former exploited natural resources and human labour. The only difference this time, perhaps, is that plantation workers at least knew they were being exploited. But those workhorse programers have been persuaded code for free in the name of the greater good. This makes the latter more akin to the soviet experiment than old-fashioned ruthless capitalism.”\n\nI told you earlier Ms. Kaminska thinks we’re all too stupid to use Bitcoin and that is why Bitcoin is dead. Well, This has been a long article, but Bitcoin doesn’t care. Here, in her own words, we are all idiots and Bitcoin is dead.\n\nAs ever, even in the cyber age, we therefore find ourselves at the mercy of same old suspects: “the good” (the legal government systems that supposedly defend our interests or in some cases doesn’t) “the bad” (organised private mercenary operations who have the loyalty of those who can defend our interests but which demand protection rents from us weaker common folk) and “the ugly” (malevolent predators who just want to mess with the system and/or survive by preying on the weak, and who the bad claim to defend us from.)\n\nIf that’s the case, the above is a true reflection of anacyclosis at work. It also suggests the only way society can truly preserve the stability and technological advances achieved by collaborative processes is by all of us mastering the techniques that can help defend us from the predators and destabilisers who understand how easy it is to cheat the system.\n\nAnd that, we dare say, amounts to a population-wide IT/encryption literacy campaign. Which, by definition, is a multi-generational project which will be unlikely to reap returns within the next business cycle, let alone overnight. – Isabella Kaminska, FT Alphaville.\n\nBitcoin is not for bootlickers or luddites comfortable with doing as they are told. On that, I completely agree with Ms. Kaminska and hope that she maintains a bailiwick far from cryptocurrency for some time to come.\n\nImages from HastyDiatribe/Photobucket and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The seemingly endless collapse of the world’s pre-eminent cryptocurrency continues, as bitcoin punched through $200 today.\n\nThe continued drop in value made the currency one of the absolute worst things to own in 2014. It remains so. Over the last 12 months bitcoin’s dollar value has fallen roughly 76%, outpacing the decline in both the beleaguered ruble (down a bit more than 70%) and Brent crude oil, which has fallen roughly 58% over the same period.\n\nOf course, both the ruble and crude have far more impact on people’s lives. But for those ill-advised gamblers who put some of their cash into bitcoin over the last year, they’re getting a little taste of how Russia’s currency collapse must feel, without ever leaving the comfort of their own home.\n\nCouldn’t bitcoin rally? Not today. The sharp drop in prices is being accompanied by a surge in volume, which is usually seen as a key confirmation of a market’s direction. (Though selling binges also sometimes mark market bottoms.) But for now bitcoin diehards are abandoning hope. Let’s hope they haven’t been hurt too badly.', 'It appears the article that was written over the weekend was quite timely.\n\nA few days ago bitcoin reached the Denial phase of the famous cycle, now it appears to be at a point of Fear and Desperation going into Panic. Volumes are picking up to an appropriate level and price has followed surging lower as of this writing it reached a low of US$166 and is now near US$190. See chart below:\n\nBelow is the bitcoin chart from the previous article with more comments added:\n\nAs was pointed out, the bottom did not lock in because the down move in price was too orderly without massive volume and no typical bottoming patterns had formed.\n\nTHIS IS STILL THE CASE. Volume has picked up dramatically once we broke the last visible support level at 255. It has been running well above its 50 day moving average and the down move is beginning to look more disorderly, which are good signs that we are progressing towards a bottom.\n\nIn fact, the last 2 days have brought the highest volume days of the year. Huge surges in volume are typical in big down moves. Buyers are still coming in at certain prices in an attempt to support the stock. These buyers will be overrun as we search for a bottom. As a side note, the Mt. Gox low was U$133 and I believe this area is one that we should note as the next area, especially after the price dipped to US$166 overnight.\n\nWhat is the price looking for?\n\nThis is essentially a search and discovery mission as for the most part over the last few years where bitcoin has been a traders’ paradise due to its volatility and respect of many technical levels. This is beginning to change as we move from trading on technicals to trading on fundamentals.\n\nThis means that the price will find a comfortable place to rest based on what people perceive the “value” of the technology itself is worth as well as where in the timeline of deployment with regards to the many of the projects that have been announced.\n\nThis is called price discovery and it usually happens once bubbles burst. There is an old saying: “Fundamentals only matter at extremes.” As bitcoin’s price continues its decline, we are learning this lesson right in front of our eyes.\n\nBottoming is a process and will not take place overnight as the price still has more work to do on the down side before any type of real bottom forms. Signs of a bottom include a tremendous drop in volume and a buying strike as people wait to see if a bottom has truly formed so they do not get burned again.\n\nAbout the author\n\nGeorge Samman is the co-founder of BTC.sx, the world’s first Bitcoin-only trading platform.

01/15/2015,"['MOST internet entrepreneurs dream of transforming an industry. On January 13th, one who may have done just that went on trial in federal court in Manhattan, accused of drug-trafficking, money-laundering and operating a criminal enterprise. Ross Ulbricht, a 30-year-old Texan physics graduate, is accused of being “Dread Pirate Roberts”, the founder and administrator of the Silk Road. This was the first website to make it possible to buy and sell illegal drugs online openly and with relative anonymity. His trial will raise questions not only about the extent and nature of cybercrime, but also about the limits of government snooping necessary to prevent it.\n\nThe Silk Road was shut down by the FBI at the end of 2013. It worked by combining two new technologies: Tor, which allows people to host websites without revealing where they are based, and bitcoin, a decentralised online currency which offers a close digital alternative to a bag of unmarked banknotes. On the site, buyers and sellers could trade with remarkable discretion. Over two years, deals generated 9.5m bitcoin in sales (worth $1.8 billion today, though the exchange rate has fluctuated wildly) and over 600,000 bitcoin in commission. That is enough booty to make Blackbeard throw away his cutlass and pick up a mouse.\n\nUpgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors’ Picks newsletters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prosecution has already produced evidence that Mr Ulbricht was Dread Pirate Roberts. They argue that he left a digital trail, administering the Silk Road through unencrypted connections and using his personal e-mail address to look for technical help. More sensationally, they allege that he not only set up the site, but sought to defend it violently. As the Dread Pirate, Mr Ulbricht is accused of paying for the assassinations of several people who threatened the site, including one former employee. None of these murders seems to have happened, but they prevented Mr Ulbricht from being granted bail after his arrest in 2013.\n\nMr Ulbricht says he was framed: the real Dread Pirates remain at large. His lawyers also claim that the FBI may have used illegal methods to identify and seize the Icelandic server on which the Silk Road was hosted, and from which much of the evidence comes. The FBI says the site contained a vulnerability which revealed where it really was, despite Tor. But several technical specialists think this implausible. Sadly for Mr Ulbricht, it may not matter much. In a ruling in October, a judge concluded that since he has not admitted any legal interest in the Silk Road server, he is unable to claim under the Fourth Amendment that it was illegally searched, and so the evidence from the server is admissible however it was found. This, the judge admitted, “might appear to place Ulbricht in a catch-22”. If he admits to an interest in the server, he would weaken his defence at his trial; if he doesn’t, he has no chance of getting the evidence against him dismissed.\n\nMr Ulbricht’s defence, which has been generously funded by online donations, is thus likely to focus on the strength of the evidence linking him to the online activities of Dread Pirate Roberts. Nonetheless, cyber-criminals—as well as other users of the dark web—will be watching closely. Since the Silk Road was taken offline, several similar market-places have been started, and many closed by the authorities. But it is still far from clear whether police forces can crack the anonymity given by technology such as Tor, or how deeply they can legitimately snoop on the web to uncloak the hosts of criminal networks.', 'If they handed out awards to financial assets like they did to movies, then Bitcoin would definitely be the winner of the Razzie for worst currency.\n\nBitcoin lost more than 60% of its value last year. The digital currency has already plunged another 30% in the first few days of 2015 -- and that includes a 30% rebound on Thursday!\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (XBT) briefly fell below $200 on Wednesday, an important psychological barrier, before bouncing back.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin news site Coindesk, it is not profitable for people to process transactions or mine for Bitcoins when the price falls below $200. ""Mining"" is the term used to describe the complex math puzzles solved by computer networks in exchange for new Bitcoins.\n\nSo what\'s next for Bitcoin? There is an intense debate about its future.\n\nBitcoin was a bubble that has burst. Jeffrey Gundlach, head of influential investment firm DoubleLine, is firmly in the Bitcoin bear camp. In a webcast on Tuesday, Gundlach declared that Bitcoin is ""on its way to being relegated to the ash heap of digital currencies.""\n\nThose comments may be one of the reasons why Bitcoin plunged on Wednesday.\n\nBut is it fair to focus on Bitcoin\'s price as a measure of failure or success? This is a currency after all.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin was one of the tech failures of 2014\n\nThe problem is that some fans of Bitcoin seem to think that it is also something that could be a good investment.\n\nAnd that does not appear to be the case. The price has swung violently over the past few years with little rhyme or reason.\n\nSome Bitcoin proponents have argued that the fact that Bitcoins are not printed by sovereign nations is a plus that should boost its value. There are a finite supply of Bitcoins determined by an algorithm.\n\nBut that doesn\'t justify why the price should have hit an all-time high above $1,100 back in November 2013.\n\nThe surge in Bitcoin prices back then was a classic speculative mania, just like Internet stocks in the late 1990s and houses in the mid-2000s.\n\nWhen people say that the price of something should keep going up indefinitely, that often means that too many people are chasing that asset higher ... and it\'s really due for a painful crash.\n\nBut Bitcoin is not dead. Still, it appears that the dust may have finally settled on Bitcoin. For that reason, it may be wrong to declare that it\'s on the way to obsolescence.\n\nThat\'s the argument of prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has invested in Bitcoin wallet startup Coinbase.\n\nAndreessen defended Bitcoin -- and attacked its many detractors -- in an epic tweetstorm last week. (26 enumerated tweets in a period of 48 minutes!)\n\nRelated: Spent bitcoins? Expect a tax headache\n\nHis main argument was that Bitcoin is an ecosystem, a method of payment. The focus on Bitcoin as if it were something investors should trade doesn\'t make sense.\n\nHere are a few of his most salient points.\n\n""Attacking Bitcoin for having speculative levels of volatility is missing the point of how the system was designed for this point in time,"" he wrote in one tweet.\n\n""In the short run, Bitcoin is still highly useful as a transaction and trust network in many uses cases even with high volatility,"" he added.\n\nHe is right about that. There is a reason why several big companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Dell and online retailer Overstock (OSTK) are accepting Bitcoins as payment.\n\nYou can also use Bitcoins to purchase gift cards from retailers such as Target (TGT)and Amazon (AMZN). And a growing number of local small businesses have embraced Bitcoin too.\n\nAndreessen also noted that ""cherry-picking"" specific date points to use when discussing the price changes also is disingenuous.\n\nAnyone that bought a Bitcoin at the end of 2012, for example, is still sitting on a huge gain.\n\nSo it\'s probably a mistake to declare the end of Bitcoin just yet. In fact, there\'s even a website devoted to Bitcoin obituary stories ... that have so far proven to be all wrong.\n\nBitcoin has apparently died 32 times already.', '', 'Bitcoin startup Xapo slashed prices on one of its account offerings Jan. 15, 2015, in an effort to drive customers amid rising interest in the cyber currency. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)\n\nWith interest rates so low, the next banking war could be over bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin startup Xapo slashed prices on one of its account offerings Thursday in an effort to drive customers amid rising interest in the cyber currency.\n\nXapo also launched a slew of new security features following concern over the latest bitcoin breach.\n\n""Security is keeping a lot of users uncomfortable using bitcoin and we understand that,"" Xapo founder and CEO Wences Casares told USA TODAY.\n\nXapo, which launched last March, said on Wednesday that its Vault product, which acts like a savings account for bitcoin, will now be free of charge. Xapo also added a slew of new security features to Vault, including a multi-signature authorization process.\n\nAccording to Casares, users will now need three keys to open their vaults, up from one previously. As before, the keys are held offline to ensure security.\n\nTo get the keys, thieves ""would need to physically break into three different bankers vaults,"" including one in ""the mountains in Switzerland,"" Casares said.\n\nBitcoin security made made headlines again this month when BitStamp, the world\'s third-largest bitcoin exchange, said some 19,000 bitcoins, worth about $5.4 million, had been lost to a security breach. The company reopened for business within a week, promising tighter security and guaranteeing losses — but not before the company was made fun of on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nBitcoin fans have been skittish since the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, collapsed last year. The Japan-based exchange has since been accused of mishandling customers\' accounts, leading to investigations in both Japan and the U.S.\n\nMt. Gox\'s collapse followed massive declines in the price of bitcoin — which lost a whopping 58% last year. But user adoption is growing, Casares argued.\n\nIndeed, bitcoin tracker Coindesk recently reported that the total number of bitcoin transactions in late 2014 nearly doubled from the previous year. Driving adoption has been a growing number of established companies OKing the cyber currency, including Microsoft and payments company PayPal.\n\nCasares said he sees interest in bitcoin growing even more in 2015.\n\n""This is an industry in its infancy, much as the Internet was before there was a browser,"" he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1IO0X1O', ""[Update: We received more information on this story from two CoinTelegraph sources in the Bitcoin space who asked not to be named.

At this time, we have yet to hear of a person who has successfully done so. We have reached out to 7-Eleven's South Korean corporate headquarters for final confirmation or denial.]\n\nSouth Korean exchange Coinplug is set to drive a rollout of Bitcoin gift cards, which anyone will be able to purchase from convenience stores imminently.\n\nOkBitcard, a scheme which will allow customers to purchase US$50 worth of bitcoin, is already operational in a range of merchants in South Korea, including 7-Eleven, in the form of a printed receipt. Soon, Coinplug stated, physical cards will also be widely available.\n\nThe company confirmed in a Reddit post on the news:\n\n“We are in the process of distributing the cards to convenient stores.”\n\nCoinplug is cementing its stance in the local Bitcoin market, having already partnered with ATM operator Nautilus Hyosung to bring two-way Bitcoin ATMs to the country last year.\n\nA promotional video for okBitcard released this week confirms that cards can be redeemed via a dedicated app by scanning a QR code and entering an additional confirmation code. Coinplug has since unveiled the final design of the cards, which have been optimized to resemble other gift cards commonly available on the market.\n\nThe number of merchants participating in the scheme nationally is 24,000, CoinDesk reports. While users picked up on the fact that no mention of 7-Eleven has been made to date, Coinplug confirmed the chain’s participation.\n\n“In order to buy, first you need to be in Korea :) then go to 7-Eleven and ask for the okBitcard. The cashier will print out a receipt that has the pincode, which you will redeem on the Coinplug's wallet app or web…,” it stated, adding that in future the physical cards will also be on sale.\n\nThe South Korean Bitcoin market involves a number of players and recently held its own Bitcoin conference in the capital city of Seoul, but despite more relaxed government treatment, adoption has been noticeably slower and less widespread than in neighboring China and further afield.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

However, the funds from these transactions were not added to our wallet.""\n\nA BitMarket.pl spokesperson said the company also found it “suspicious” that the transactions had very similar ID codes, when these are normally very different.\n\nGOLDUX.com’s representative said his company had also been experiencing problems with EgoPay’s API.\n\n“The issue started at the end of December when we received some fraud callbacks from the EgoPay API. After that, EgoPay disabled its API and all payments were done manually,” he said.\n\nA few days later, on 8th January, the representative received an email from EgoPay stating that a portion of GOLDUX.com’s funds had been frozen. He also noticed that payments were no longer being processed by the company at that time.\n\nWhere payments had previously been marked as “completed”, GOLDUX.com suggested they were remaining as “pending”.\n\nWhen CoinDesk tested EgoPay’s API, we attempted to make a transaction but found our funds also labelled “pending”, with no further movement.\n\nLack of communication\n\nWhen logged in as a user on EgoPay, a message is displayed notifying clients of a delay in payment processing, it states:\n\n""EgoPay Members will be experiencing higher than normal review times for all withdrawals and deposits as EgoPay is currently conducting a system migration. EgoPay will now be able to provide a more secure netywork for all members through wihch to complate their online transfers. EgoPays standard review time frames and service level agreements will return to normal and EgoPay appreciates your cooperation and understanding.”\n\nNot only are EgoPay’s clients dissatisfied with their funds being locked, they are less than pleased with the company’s lack of communication on the matter.\n\nThe site’s Live Support feature remains offline, even during the stated working hours, and the support team’s Skype accounts are also offline.\n\nA representative from BTC-e, known only as ‘Alex’, said he hadn’t heard from EgoPay since 22nd December.\n\nEgoPay’s CEO Tadas Kasputis failed to respond to requests for comment on these latest service interruptions.\n\nPast problems\n\nThe current instance isn’t the first time companies have had their funds frozen by EgoPay. On 4th August, EgoPay froze BTC-e’s account, which contained $200,000, without giving any warning or explanation.\n\nAt the time, an EgoPay customer support staff member told CoinDesk:\n\n“We were investigating a string of suspicious transactions … in to EgoPay from several outside sources. The risk involved with these transactions ranges from losses occurring due to chargebacks and external government investigations for money laundering purposes or illegal activity funding.”\n\nAlex said some of BTC-e\'s funds were released on 8th August, but that his company was then blocked entirely from accessing its EgoPay user account in mid-September, with $150,000 stuck inside.\n\nAllegations abound\n\nIn September, BTC-e voiced allegations that EgoPay was insolvent and had “stolen” its clients’ funds. On 23rd September, Kasputis responded to requests for comment, rebutting the accusations and accusing BTC-e of attempting ""to utilize client funds for personal uses"".\n\nBoth companies continued to dispute the others’ allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nIn more recent allegations, the representative from GOLDUX.com shared his belief that EgoPay’s servers were hacked in late December. He alleges that this is what affected the company\'s merchant API, which enabled false callbacks to be made to several of the merchants and exchangers that use EgoPay.\n\nFor now, EgoPay’s clients are continuing to wait to hear from the company, to find out if and when their transactions will be completed and whether or not they will gain access to their frozen funds.

The price crashed from $224 at midnight to around $175 (a drop of almost 22%) in just a matter of hours, before rebounding again.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the drop in value has set off a whirlwind of conversation about the future of bitcoin, both from within and outside the community.\n\nTwitter was awash with comments throughout the whole of yesterday, as bitcoiners and commentators pondered the causes and potential ramifications of the drop.\n\nThe mainstream media has also reacted, acknowledging the extreme price movements and predicting the potential effect on the cryptocurrency\'s future with varying degrees of level-headedness or hysteria.\n\nSo, what did they say? CoinDesk has rounded some up of the top headlines from yesterday.\n\nThe moderate view\n\nUnsurprisingly, there was no real consensus across publications. While some prophesied that the future of bitcoin was bleak, others took more measured views.\n\nThe New York Times ran with, ""As Bitcoin\'s Price Slides, Signs of a Squeeze"", in which Sydney Ember commented that confidence was dwindling, and stating that ""some mining companies have started to flash the warning signs.""\n\nAs the price of bitcoin drops, and difficulty stays relatively high, mining companies are left to assess their dwindling profit margins.\n\nMashable\'s Seth Fiegerman explained that CEX.io, which runs a cloud mining service, had been ""forced to suspend operations due to the declining prices presumably cutting into profit margins"".\n\nThe Guardian\'s piece, titled ""Bitcoin price plunge sparks new crash fears"", distinguishes between what is currently happening from what occurred in the summer of 2011 and 2013:\n\n""This time the cryptocurrency has not been the victim of a speculative bubble that then popped. Rather, the price of bitcoin has been declining fairly consistency since June 2014, when it started falling after months of temporary stability at about $600 a coin.""\n\nCNBC\'s Everett Rosenfeld, draws on recent events to explain the possible reasoning behind the current price drop, putting forward the argument that cryptocurrency speculators may have been spooked by the Bitstamp hack which saw the loss of $5m in bitcoins.\n\nThe ban imposed on bitcoin-related websites by the Russian authorities may also be a contributing factor, he said.\n\nDoom and gloom\n\nFT Alphaville\'s report reads almost like a bitcoin obituary and, in a rather surprising twist, draws on an analogy with one of George Orwell\'s most famous books.\n\n""With Animal Farm in mind, has Bitcoin the asset’s failure thus shone a light on a system which routinely propagandises the benefits of sharing intellectual property for free while rewarding only those who live by entirely different principles?""\n\nIt also goes on to question whether ""bitcoin really represented something akin to perestroika, a political movement for reform which in reality only benefitted a select bunch of shrewd operators"".\n\nOne of the most negative positions is perhaps put forward by The Sydney Morning Herald, which described bitcoin\'s entry into 2015 as ""appalling,"" claiming that the currency ""appears to be in freefall"".\n\nThe Australian newspaper also alludes to the fact that some are crediting the market\'s instability to the notable Trial of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, which began in New York City yesterday.\n\nLooking on the bright side\n\nTechCrunch\'s John Biggs throws some positivity into the mix with the headline ""The Rainbow After the Bitcoin Storm"". Although he acknowledges that the current value ""is a far cry from the heady $1,000 days of late 2013,"" he also asserts that ""unlike Robert Redford\'s sailing trip, all is not lost"".\n\nTimothy B Lee, over at Vox, claims that ""Bitcoin has already fallen 40 percent this year. That doesn\'t mean it\'s doomed"".\n\nJerry Brito, executive director at Coin Center, has his say in a Wired article, opining that:\n\n""The price of bitcoin doesn\'t matter right now.""\n\nShifting focus away from the price, Brito compares bitcoin to the early days of the Internet and its positive evolution throughout the years:\n\n""Unlike the early web, bitcoin has a price ticker people look at daily, and so they wring their hands. Every dip and spike in the price gets a lot of attention and spells either doom or irrational exuberance.”\n\nOnly time will tell what the future holds for bitcoin. At the time of press, however, the price had returned to around $224, and was largely recovered from yesterday\'s dip.\n\nNewspapers image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

01/16/2015,"[""After only three days into the trial of Ross Ulbricht, the alleged kingpin of the underground drug marketplace known as the Silk Road, the defendant's situation is going from bad to worse. I previously wrote how the prosecution could follow the Bitcoin to show that Ulbricht ran Silk Road. Its no longer speculation: I've already identified a 3255 BTC (roughly $300,000 at the time) payment from Silk Road to Ulbricht. The prosecution can undoubtedly find many more.\n\n@1mp0ster on Twitter pointed me to walletexplorer, a Bitcoin wallet explorer that uses clustering approaches and already has put in heuristics to cluster wallets. With just a couple of clicks (in fact, the first few clicks I tried), I was able to discover this Ulbricht wallet. We know this is Ulbricht's wallet because it was seized by the FBI.\n\nThis wallet was funded with two transactions on August 21st, 2013. Both transactions are believed by WalletExplorer to be from the Silk Road Marketplace. But we don't need to depend on WalletExplorer's\n\nheuristics. One of the wallets which funded Ulbricht's wallet is this one. We know this wallet is from Silk Road because it too was seized by the FBI. Thus we can generally assume that all the wallets in this transaction are Silk Road, since this was a single transaction paid to a single wallet belonging to Ulbricht.\n\nThus this single transaction of 3255 BTC (roughly $300,000 at the time) on August 21st, 2013 is directly from Silk Road to Ulbricht's admitted stash of Bitcoins. This is just the first one I've found. The prosecution, with access to the Silk Road and Ulbricht's wallets, can almost certainly show many, many more. I think the prosecution futures just paid out in full."", 'In the past week, selling pressure on Bitcoin from mining companies that process payments in the digital currency has accelerated, prompting more rounds of selling and falling prices. The onslaught pushed the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index as low as $173 on January 14 \x97 the first time it traded below $200 since November 2013 \x97 before rebounding higher yesterday.\n\nThe challenge faced by mining companies is that while they are paid in Bitcoins, their operational costs are paid in hard currencies and maintenance costs have been rising as the difficulty of mining new Bitcoins increases. As prices have declined, the payments processors earn less, yet still have to pay out expenses in hard currencies with Bitcoins that are worth less. \x93We\x92ve seen a lot of these guys folding basically in the last few weeks because it\x92s not even worth it for them to power the equipment\x94 to do the payments processing, says Greg Schvey, partner at TradeBlock, a New York\x96based Bitcoin trading data center.\n\nMining processor troubles hit the headlines January 12 when London-based Bitcoin mining service company CEX.io temporarily halted operations because they had become unprofitable. \x93Suspension of CEX.io cloud mining service is only a forced temporary measure, the result of cloud mining costs exceeding mining profit,\x94 stated Jeffrey Smith, chief information officer, in a blog post to follow on a Tweet in which he made the initial announcement. CEX.io is looking for lower cloud mining and maintenance costs based or higher Bitcoin prices to allow it to resume operations. Smith told CoinDesk that Bitcoin prices would need to rise to $320 for the company to resume operations, absent any cost savings for operations.\n\nThe next day, CoinTerra of Austin, Texas, reported it has been forced to default on $4.25 million of secured notes after being shut out of its data center where the firm ran its mining operation. CoinTerra\x92s service provider, C7 Data Centers of Bluffdale, Utah, has sued it for nonpayment of fees. \x93Who would predict the downfall that Bitcoin has taken, in terms of price and difficulty and all that?\x94 CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar told CoinDesk January 15. \x93A lot of things have happened that were not foreseen.\x94 Iyengar told CoinDesk its next step would depend on how C7 proceeds.\n\nBy any measure, Bitcoin is a volatile and inefficient market in which spot prices in hard currencies on exchanges, most of which are outside the U.S., can gyrate wildly in a single day and are vulnerable to disruptions in exchange operations and potential hacking of stored digital currencies. For example, on January 5, Slovenia\x96based Bitstamp exchange, a leading trader in Bitcoin and U.S. dollars, discontinued service after a hack of some of its wallets, raising worries of another repeat of the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange in Tokyo a year earlier. Bitstamp restored trading on January 9.\n\nSince the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index skyrocketed to a high of $1,147.25 on December 4, 2013, market gyrations have continued even as more venture capital and new start-ups expanded the reach of Bitcoin and the scope of its \x93ecosystem,\x94 as its advocates call it. In 2014 prices rode a roller coaster in the first half of the year, then began a bumpy decline in the second half, falling from $665.73 on June 3 to $319.70 on December 31, 2014.\n\nOn January 14 the dollar price of Bitcoin plunged 21.9 percent (from $226.98) to end the day at $177.28, then recovered 18.7 percent to $210.46 at the end of the January 15. Given that Bitcoin is traded around the clock, seven days a week, the Bitcoin market close is determined as the last trade just before midnight UTC, also known as Greenwich Mean Time.\n\nBitcoin veterans are undeterred by the recent volatility. \x93I\x92ve been involved in the Bitcoin space since 2011 and I\x92ve witnessed several different periods where there\x92s market movement and then new equilibrium levels are set, [and the current turmoil] is no different from what I\x92ve tended to see over the last couple of years,\x94 says Paul Chou, co-founder and CEO of LedgerX, a Bitcoin trading company that has applied for approval from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to operate as a derivatives exchange and clearinghouse.\n\nSchvey at TradeBlock says the current shakeout in payment processors will lead to a new equilibrium. \x93What happens is at a certain point miners are paid out by the network in an amount proportional to the computational power they deliver,\x94 he says. \x93So people with higher operational costs are pulling out of the market.\x94 That, in turn, will reduce the competitive pressure on surviving mining companies, \x93which means that those other people will reach profitability faster, will earn more Bitcoins for the some amount of computing power, which also means they will have less incentive to go out and dump [coins] in the market,\x94 he explains. Even if Bitcoins are worth less, by reducing operating costs, the surviving payment processors \x93will have less incentive to sell,\x94 he explains.\n\nSome market participants question the claim that selling by miners has driven down the price of Bitcoin. \x93It\x92s just an assumption people are making,\x94 says a trader who does proprietary trades for institutional investors. \x93It could be true, but where is the evidence?\x93 he asks. The trader says it is more likely that the temporary suspension of trading at Bitstamp early in January is the larger factor that has spooked the markets the same way the collapse of Mt. Gox did a year ago.\n\nRegardless of the cause, selling pressures can be mitigated if more investors come into the Bitcoin market. A U.S.-regulated derivatives market could bring in those needed investors, according to Chou at LedgerX. With a functioning derivatives market, payments processors could enter contracts to protect downside losses and avoid the prospect of having to dump Bitcoins in times of market stress, he explains.\n\n\x93Historically in other asset classes, not only Bitcoin, as people jump on and board and start to use derivative instruments to monetize that volatility, what we tend to see is that naturally the underlying spot and asset class volatility goes down,\x94 Chou says. \x93I expect to see the same thing in the Bitcoin ecosystem as well.\x94\n\nGet more on trading and technology.', 'Bitcoin value in USD took a nosedive over the first couple weeks of 2015. The price dipped well under US$200 earlier this week but is back over that mark at the time of writing.\n\nThe catalyst is unclear, but many big events could have contributed to the spiraling price: Bitstamp\'s temporary closure, the pause on CEX.io cloud mining, and Russia\'s crusade against Bitcoin websites. Additionally, others noted that Ethereum has been selling off their bitcoins and there are also rumors swirling that investor giants have been selling off in the run up to the Winklevoss ETF IPO.\n\nThe typical narrative goes something like this: Investors panic as they watch the price drop, so the selling continues, and the price falls further.\n\nBut many Bitcoin advocates are unfazed. Rather, they\'re deriding people who buy high and sell low. A recent satirical Reddit thread titled “A Guide to Quitting Bitcoin” captures this sentiment perfectly:\n\nStep 1: Panic Sell: Quickly go to your exchange of choice (preferably one located in a country other than your own) and sell all your bitcoin. Don\'t even risk owning the smallest fraction of a coin. If you really want to commit to quitting, do it right and sell everything.\n\nStep 2: Seek Validation on Your Favorite Bitcoin Forum: It is simply not enough to sell all your bitcoin. To ensure that you later don\'t have a ""change of heart,"" it is required that you announce your departure. Regular bitcoin users also like to see who is leaving, so it is important for you to tell them. You won\'t believe how much strangers on the Internet care!\n\nStep 3: Make Sure You Know Your Talking Points: People leaving bitcoin need to have a reason why. Make sure you have one in your pocket especially during step 2. Please choose one of these: ""Price Volatility"", ""Centralized Mining"", ""Fixed Supply"".\n\nStep 4: Enjoy the Freedom from Bitcoin Shackles.\n\nAnother user added another six steps to drive the point home. A few months later, Bitcoin isn\'t dead. Actually, it has soared in price. Awestruck, the investor buys at another peak. The price tumbles again. Then it would be only be natural to repeat the cycle returning to step one and sell in panic.\n\nAnd sadly, this actually happens. Case and point, a Redditor posted Wednesday: “Just sold 25 bitcoins at a US$180, good luck with your “currency”, I\'m out.” The user claimed to have purchased bitcoin at the US$1,100 price peak.\n\nThe author of the aforementioned guide responded: “Thank you for reading my guide.”\n\nThe nonchalant attitude might surprise. Bitcoin lost 40% of its value so far in 2015, yet Bitcoin advocates are laughing at the desperate sellers.\n\nThe thing is, many following the Bitcoin space have seen the currency “die” many times before—30 times now, in fact, according to the site Bitcoin Obituaries, which posts links to articles reporting Bitcoin\'s demise. Bitcoin has been known for its volatility, and these declarations were often made at a price trough.\n\nSome are laughing. Some are defending. Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin evangelist and host of the Let\'s Talk Bitcoin podcast, took to Twitter Wednesday:\n\nBitcoin is not dead. Please submit your obituaries to t.co/5KBoyRTLqK for the collection. — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) 14th january 2015\n\nChastising speculators, he added:\n\n“Bitcoin"", the speculative small-cap get-rich-quick investment scheme is definitely dead for now. Bitcoin however is fine. — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) 14th january 2015\n\nBitcoin is generally viewed as a long-term investment. In the long term, maybe these temporary price dips won\'t matter. But anyone familiar will remind you:\n\n“Don\'t invest more than you\'re willing to lose.”\n\nRight now, the whole situation looks like another example of the masses buying high and selling low from fear, panic and, yes, greed that the value will go even lower.\n\nOf course, that\'s not to say Bitcoin can\'t collapse in price. But when you\'ve seen it happen before—two times, or 30 times—it looks like just another day for Bitcoin.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Even if the cold storage device could be compromised by malware, stolen private keys would fail to be transmitted to a thief because it isn\'t connected to the Internet.\n\nHow it works\n\nVerbücheln\'s paper, which is titled, How Perfect Offline Wallets Can Still Leak Bitcoin Private Keys, sets out an attack that centres on bitcoin\'s cryptographic algorithm.\n\nThis mathematical formula, known as ECDSA or the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, is used in the bitcoin protocol to ensure funds can be only be spent by their rightful owners.\n\nWhen a bitcoin transaction takes place, it contains one or more ECDSA signatures. The number of signatures in a transaction depends on the number of inputs that it contains and are used to prove the transactions were authorised by their rightful owners. The amount of bitcoin contained in a transaction consists of the sum of its inputs.\n\nThe attacker must first create a compromised version of ECDSA. This is achieved with a kleptographic \'SETUP\', or \'Secretly Embedded Trapdoor with Embedded Protection\', which was first described in a 1997 paper by Adam Young and Moti Yung. That paper described a similar attack on the Digital Signature Algorithm, on which ECDSA is based.\n\nEach time a bitcoin transaction is signed, the signature is generated partly from a random number known as \'k\'. The compromised ECDSA uses a specific formula to select \'k\', which is in turn used to compute a further value \'k2\'.\n\nThe attacker will now watch for consecutive signatures signed by the compromised ECDSA. Because he knows how \'k2\' was computed in the first place, he will be able to calculate that value from two consecutive signatures. With \'k2\' in hand, the attacker can work backwards to calculate \'k\' and the private key to that address.\n\n""After the attacker knows \'k2\' for an ECDSA signature, it is easy for him to compute the private key,"" Verbücheln said.\n\nAn observer of the blockchain – and even the attacker himself – looking at signatures from this compromised elliptic curve would not be able to detect any faults. Unlike a general observer, however, the attacker would be running his extraction formula on every signature on the blockchain, hoping to find the \'k2\' value from signatures generated by his malicious ECDSA.\n\nEventually, the attacker will hit on the signatures signed by his handiwork, allowing him to discover \'k2\' and ultimately derive the addresses\' private key.\n\n""He can now store the extracted private keys and watch the addresses\' balance. He can use them to steal money at any point in time,"" Verbücheln said.\n\nThe good news\n\nVerbücheln said his paper has not been submitted for publication yet, although he is giving a talk on the topic at a conference in Amsterdam next week.\n\nWhile the scenario described by Verbücheln is frightening – private keys essentially leaked to the blockchain – the good news is that it\'s a difficult attack to carry out on a large scale.\n\nIvan Pustogarov, a researcher at the University of Luxembourg\'s cryptology research group, said an attempt to smuggle compromised ECDSA code into a popular open-source wallet, for example, would be discovered by the public.\n\n""In open-source [software] on a large scale ... The code will be analysed at some point in time and the malicious implementation detected,"" he said.\n\nVerbücheln largely shares this assessment, although he cautions that some pieces of open-source code are so large and complex that even a dedicated community of developers may not detect a malicious addition.\n\nBoth Verbücheln and Pustogarov say that the most likely way for such an attack to be mounted would be through dedicated wallet services running proprietary software. Devices designed specifically for secure cold-storage of coins, for example, would be prime candidates for this sort of attack.\n\n""Even if the manufacturer claims that it runs open-source code, how do you tell whether it is actually running what you compiled?"" Verbücheln said.\n\nAccording to Pustogarov, the Verbücheln paper describes an attack that is related to the \'repeated r-values\' flaw that white-hat hacker \'Johoe\' famously exploited to grab more than 500 BTC from wallet provider Blockchain.\n\n""These two issues are related. The [Verbücheln] paper describes a more general approach, and repeated r-values is a sub-case,"" he said.\n\nVerbücheln said he does not know if the attack he described has actually been carried out. Nevertheless, the possibility that one of the core cryptographic algorithms underpinning bitcoin could be cunningly compromised, allowing a thief to pick the lock of even the most secure addresses, presents a chilling scenario.\n\n""This attack has been known for many years for related crypto systems, so you can\'t know for sure,"" he said.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That is significantly down from its peak, which was near $1,000.\n\nIf bitcoin were simply a digital currency that exploded and collapsed, that would be that. We could all move on, and act like nothing happened.\n\nBut, bitcoin is more than another fad according to venture capitalists who are pouring millions of dollars into it.\n\nA year ago, when bitcon\'s value was flying to the moon, Marc Andreessen wrote an op-ed for The New York Times on why bitcoin matters. In it, he compared bitcoin to the internet and personal computers. He believes bitcoin has the potential to be that transformative.\n\nAnother influential VC, Fred Wilson, is a big believer in bitcoin. He also believes it has a chance to be a transformative technology. He has invested in companies working on bitcoin.\n\nBut now that the price is cratering, are Wilson and Andreessen going to see their investments go poof? No, at least, not in their opinions.\n\nOn Twitter, Wilson said the price collapse could actually be a good thing. He said the ""price decline will certainly have impact."" But, he added, the ""best thing to come of it may be to get people to stop focusing on & talking about price.""\n\nAnother investor in bitcoin, Barry Silbert, said he\'s seen ""no impact"" from the price of bitcoin falling.\n\nSo, what has these people so excited about bitcoin, even though the price is falling?\n\nI spoke with Scott Rosenberg about it on the podcast I do with Farhad Manjoo of The New York Times. Rosenberg is veteran technology writer who co-founded Salon. He wrote a big piece on bitcoin, and its potential for Backchannel, a new technology site.\n\nThe reason people are excited about bitcoin has less to do with bitcoin and more to do with the technology that supports it. That technology is called ""blockchain."" Essentially, blockchain creates a new type of internet. Bitcoin is just the first application on top of the blockchain.\n\nTo look at the failure of bitcoin, and say that it was just a fad, according to Rosenberg, is to look at early web products that were bad and say, ""Well, looks like the internet isn\'t going to work!""\n\nThe internet came together when Netscape was built. It took years before Google search existed. It took years for Facebook, and all sorts of other great applications to be built.

But Roger Ver won\'t be coming.\n\nVer -- a 35-year-old, self-made millionaire -- was denied a U.S. visa, even though he was born and raised in Silicon Valley. But Ver renounced his citizenship in 2014, trading the Stars and Stripes for the small Caribbean island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\n\nSee also: As Bitcoin Conference Comes to Miami, Arrests, Hacks Leave E-Currency Shaky\n\nNicknamed the ""bitcoin Jesus"" for his relentless praise of wonders of the new currency, Ver also makes money trading bitcoin on an open market.\n\nNew Times reached out to the U.S. State Department for clarification why Ver was denied entry for this weekend\'s conference. A State Department official cited immigration privacy laws in declining to discuss exactly why he was denied entry.\n\n""\u200eAll visa applicants are welcome to reapply,"" the spokeswoman says in an email. ""Visa applicants must meet the requirements set forth under U.S. Law in order to be issued a U.S. Visa.""\n\nAccording to Ver, the reason is clear: It\'s because his ties aren\'t strong enough with the Caribbean nation he now calls home. When he tried to apply for a visa through the embassy in Barbados three times, he was swiftly rejected each time, even though he paid $160 each time.\n\n""One of the most common elements within the various nonimmigrant visa requirements is for the applicant to demonstrate that they have a residence in a foreign country which they have no intention of abandoning,"" according to the official embassy rejection that Ver provided to New Times. ""You have demonstrated that you have the ties that will compel you to return to your home country after your travel to the United States.""\n\nEssentially, according to Ver, this means that U.S. officials are worried that he will overstay his visa and become an ""illegal"" citizen in his home country.\n\nVer says he renounced his citizenship to take a stand against sovereign governments. ""I actually am philosophically opposed to the very concept of citizenship,"" Ver said in an email. ""I think all human beings, regardless of where they happened to have been born, have an equal right to travel the planet.""\n\n(Of course, critics think he had a more expedient reason: Skirting U.S. taxes.)\n\nEither way, there\'s no doubt Ver has been an important advocate for bitcoin, which emerged as a new form of currency sometime six years ago. The currency operates solely in the digital world, traded anonymously, privately and with no interference from an institution such as a bank. No one knows who created it (or whether it was a person or a group) but a white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto describing the new currency was published in 2009.\n\nBitcoin can pay for anything from a meal to clothes to illicit drugs from online marketplaces like the infamous Silk Road -- a fact that has led to law enforcement crackdowns and the arrest of two Miami men last year for money laundering with the currency.\n\nTo Ver, the benefits of bitcoin are multitude: ""You can send any amount of money, anywhere in the world, instantly, at almost no cost, and it is impossible for anyone, including governments to block the payment.""\n\nTo demonstrate, Ver sent a New Times writer a small, anonymous payment of 0.27766235 bitcoins (which is worth about $60).\n\nVer is no doubt frustrated by his inability to get to Miami this weekend. All of his immediate family lives in the United States, yet it has become nearly impossible to see them. He says it\'s unfair the U.S. won\'t let him back in despite the clear evidence that he has no intention of staying.\n\n""They refused to even allow me to slide the evidence through the window for their review,"" he says.\n\nFollow Miami New Times on Facebook and Twitter @MiamiNewTimes.', 'Andreas Antonopoulos is a Bitcoin expert, host of Let\'s Talk Bitcoin and author of Mastering Bitcoin.

Within, Antonopoulos described why Bitcoin is here to stay, expressed his interest in the Reddit cryptocurrency project, and explained how to “fight” a horse.\n\nHere are our 10 favorite quotes:\n\n1.\n\n“Bitcoin will remain, in my opinion, a relentless anomaly that refuses to go away - a black swan that cannot be ignored or extinguished.”\n\n2.\n\n“Content creators now have a new way of financing their creativity, without depending on advertisers or media channels. Bitcoin can help with the evolution of kickstarter, indiegogo and other crowdfunding tools into global, borderless and massive systems for funding the arts and creative content. I can\'t wait!”\n\nIn response to a comment from a tiny production company in the middle of crowdfunding a horror film. They wanted to know Bitcoin might be applied in the arts world.\n\n3.\n\n“For the \'other 6 billion\' who don\'t enjoy international, control-free banking as we do, bitcoin represents an opportunity to become part of a global economy which up till now did not exist. For those users, bitcoin is more than just a curiosity, it might be a doorway to connect to the world.”\n\n4.\n\n“Bitcoin\'s consensus algorithm requires a very conservative approach to change, so I certainly think it is best to solve problems when they are actually problems and not before.”\n\nIn a response to a question about long term Bitcoin scalability.\n\n5.\n\n“Most of the countries with large incoming remittances flows are also countries with severely restricted currency outflows (currency controls). In those countries, many wealthy people have the need to convert their money into foreign currencies. These are counter-flows but they are asymmetric. For example, a single wealthy person extracting 10,000 currency units a week could support 1000x poor people importing 10 currency units from immigrant workers abroad or contract work for foreign companies. Successful remittances depend on matching these two needs and creating balanced flows in both directions.”\n\n6.\n\n“Decentralized exchanges would be best, but despite hard work from many, such a system has not been built so far.”\n\n7. One commenter asked: “Would you rather fight a horse-sized duck, or 100 duck-sized horses?” Antonopoulos replied thoughtfully:\n\n“100 duck-sized horses. Ducks are aggressive and predatory and are used as livestock guards in farms in England because of their aggressive temperament. Horses are by nature docile prey animals that are easily spooked and risk averse. I wouldn\'t fight, I\'d just go \'BOO!\'”\n\n8.\n\n“Security is both the biggest issue in bitcoin and the biggest opportunity in bitcoin. Solve it and you may create a massive new industry. ”\n\n9.\n\n“Bitcoin is at the same stage as the Internet in 1992-1993. At that time, it took UNIX command-line skills to send email. No way near ready for mainstream adoption.”\n\n10.\n\n“Bitcoin has a tremendous \'network effect\', in my opinion, which may give it an insurmountable early-mover advantage. In technology it is often not the best technology that ""wins"", but the one that achieves broad enough adoption and recognition early enough. Good enough beats best if deployed broadly.”\n\nAnd finally, here is a bonus honorable mention:\n\n11.\n\n“The average user should pick up bitcoin: “To experience the future of money.

01/17/2015,"['The idea behind Bitcoin is simple. Unlike modern fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin has no supervising authority, no regulation, and no central bank. Users can use bitcoins to buy and sell goods anonymously without any outside interference. The idea has caught on. Created in 2009 by an unknown entity called ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" Bitcoin has begun to enter the mainstream. Companies like Amazon, CVS, and Victoria\'s Secret now accept them as legal tender.\n\nThe trial of Ross Ulbricht , which began last week in Manhattan, doesn\'t lack for entertainment value. The 30-year-old is accused of founding and administering Silk Road, an online market that allowed users to buy and sell illegal drugs using bitcoins as currency. Founded in 2011, prosecutors allege that Silk Road generated $1.2 billion in revenue —including an estimated $80 million paid in commissions—until the FBI shut it down in 2013. Ulbricht has pled not guilty. But whatever the verdict, the legacy of Ulbricht\'s high-profile case may strike a blow against Bitcoin\'s future viability.\n\n""Bitcoin is insanely traceable,"" Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at University of California Berkeley\'s International Computer Science Institute told the Verge.\n\nAs an unregulated currency, Bitcoin appeared to be a natural fit for the illicit drug market. But while Bitcoin is anonymous, it isn\'t untraceable. When users convert bitcoins to hard currency, their name becomes linked to a ""public blockchain"" that comprises the entire transactional history of the bitcoin. This would be equivalent to a $20 bill containing a comprehensive history of every person who has touched it since emerging from the printing press. These public blockchains make it very easy for law enforcement officials, once users\' identities are compromised, to understand the full extent of their illicit activity.\n\n""Bitcoin is insanely traceable.""\n\nBitcoins, of course, are used for more than just drugs. But even in legal markets, the currency\'s volatility makes it an unattractive bet for would-be investors. Everyone knows that the fall in oil prices gutted Russia\'s ruble, which lost more than half of its value in 2014. But Bitcoin fared even worse, falling 76 percent. And unlike the ruble, which Moscow can rescue through manipulating interest rates and instituting capital controls, Bitcoin\'s lack of a central bank means there\'s nothing to stop it from sliding even further.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin so volatile? Although generally thought of (and used as) a currency, bitcoins are better thought of as an asset bubble, the Washington Post\'s Matt O\'Brien argues. The supply of bitcoins increases when investors ""mine"" new ones, a process that involves using supercomputers to solve difficult mathematical equations. Because this process is expensive, miners borrow (real) money to finance it. This routine worked well in 2013, when bitcoins were worth more than $1,000 each. But when bitcoins lose their value, investors cannot mine each bitcoin to pay off their loans—a fate that struck Mark Karpeles, a Tokyo-based owner of the world\'s largest Bitcoin exchange who was forced to file for bankruptcy early last year.*\n\nRoss Ulbricht\'s trial will focus on far more than the currency he used for facilitating the drug trade. But while Bitcoin itself will remain legal and popular, its potential to rival traditional forms of currency appear unlikely to materialize.', 'If only Piper Chapman’s girlfriend, the protagonist in the Netflix series, “Orange is The New Black,” knew the alleged Dread Pirate Roberts and his Libertarian bitcoin Web project, Silk Road, maybe she wouldn’t have had to ask Piper to carry the suitcase full of drug money that landed Piper in the slammer.\n\nNow, in a drama unfolding in a federal courtroom in New York, Silk Road’s alleged mastermind, Ross Ulbricht, aka the accused Dread Pirate Roberts is on trial with details salacious enough to be Netflix’s next miniseries. Or the sequel to “The Princess Bride.” Dread Pirate Roberts is a character in this classic book and film whose identity is never known and easily mistaken.\n\n“Ross was the perfect fall guy,” the defense claims.\n\nAnd so the drama behind the Silk Road trial has begun.\n\nIn this case, the Silk Road isn’t a story of the ancient silk and spice trading routes to Asia. It’s about drugs and bitcoins and the leader who masterminded it all. And the real identity of that mastermind.\n\nThe journey down The Silk Road since October of 2013 hasn’t been smooth sailing for Ross Ulbricht, a 30-year-old Texan with a degree in physics, who is accused of being the Dread Pirate Roberts — AKA the alleged captain of the site used for drug-trafficking, money-laundering and criminal activities. That site was sunk when the FBI busted it after a two-year investigation that followed the bitcoin trail into the newest generation of cybercrime on the dark web.\n\nBut is he the mastermind behind the scheme that will set the tone for many cybersecurity trials to come? Is the man who says on his LinkedIn profile that he “[wants] to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind” the same man who created the site that the federal government says ran the massive online illegal drug trade that brought in billions of dollars for selling heroin, cocaine and crystal meth? Those billions of dollars, however, were masked by the allegedly unsuspecting digital currency known as bitcoin that allows users to mask their true identities.\n\nOr is the mastermind Mark Karpeles? He’s the bitcoin tycoon that Ulbricht’s defense lawyers say is the true Dread Pirate Roberts — a claim which Karpeles adamantly denies. And since the Feds haven’t presented any evidence publicly otherwise, Ulbricht is the man on trial.\n\nSome computer science experts are skeptical about Ulbricht’s claims, based on what prosecutors have presented as evidence from the bitcoin collection alone. According to Forbes, the amount of bitcoins seized from Ulbricht was valued somewhere between $18 million and $20 million at the time of the seizure, which Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute, said raises more than scant suspicion.\n\n“The defense attorney better hope Ulbricht really was a brilliant Bitcoin trader, because that defense is easy to shred otherwise,” Weaver said. “Bitcoin is insanely traceable. The Silk Road bitcoins are well known, not just the ones seized but the entire cloud of Bitcoins. Add in the known purchases from law enforcement, and it becomes downright trivial to create the ‘history cluster’ that is Silk Road.”\n\nThe Journey To The Silk Road\n\nBefore traveling further down the road, let’s go back to the time when the accused Dread Pirate Roberts was arrested.\n\nIt was October 2013 and his arrest was not in some underground lab or a tech-savvy office hidden away from the portals or society. Nope, this supposed cyber-pirate was arrested in a San Francisco, California, public library — a beacon for free speech and Internet freedom.\n\nOh, the irony.\n\nThe agents had been quietly watching him for two years and the time had come to strike. The likely unsuspecting Ulbricht clicked on a message on a forum linked to the website. He logged on to The Silk Road, according to federal prosecutors, giving them what they needed to swoop in for the arrest.\n\nA federal agent, posing as a Silk Road member, had him just where the government wanted. Click. Click. Click. That’s all they needed. Ulbricht took the bait and the Feds swept in.\n\nThey wanted him online as “Dread Pirate Roberts in the marketplace,” said undercover Department of Homeland Security Agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan. And that’s what they said they got. His defense lawyers, however, say they arrested the founder of the site, but not the captain of the ship.\n\n”We have the name of the real mastermind and it’s not Ulbricht,” Joshua Dratel, Ulbricht’s lawyer, said in court Jan. 15. He’s arguing that Ulbricht was framed by Karpeles.\n\nBut Karpeles has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n“This is probably going to be disappointing for you, but I am not Dread Pirate Roberts,” he said. “The investigation reached that conclusion already—this is why I am not the one sitting during the Silk Road trial, and I can only feel defense attorney Joshua Dratel trying everything he can to point the attention away from his client,” the bitcoin mogul said.\n\nSo why is Karpeles’ name being tossed in the ring anyway – and why is that so interesting?\n\nSimple.\n\nKarpeles is the former CEO of Mr. Gox, the busted Bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo. Karpeles is also now the current CEO of Tibanne Co, a company that specializes in Web hosting, application development, network administration and business development. The nature of how bitcoin is used and traded has also become a key part of this federal investigation. As of now there is no indication Karpeles is involved as a suspect, as he is allegedly cooperating with the government’s investigation.\n\nBut the defense has’t given up. One theory in the case is that there is not just one person leading the way as the Dread Pirate Roberts, but rather the “person” in question is a “series of individuals who pass along the name and reputation to a chosen successor.”\n\nHere’s what the defense claims: Ulbricht founded the Silk Road as a free-market site to sell almost anything. It was an economic experiment that grew too large and he passed off the site to others. They then claim he was lured back by the operators of the site, baited into the library and put into the hands of the federal government as a scapegoat.\n\nBut that’s not the case the Feds have presented.\n\n“We are here to pull the curtain back on the dark and secret world. Behind that curtain was one man: Ross Ulbricht and his laptop,” assistant U.S. attorney Timothy Howard told the jury.\n\nAnd the plot thickens.\n\nThe defense’s theory that Ulbricht was framed was a key theme throughout the first days of trial as the presiding judge in the case, Katherine Forrest said the defense is still arguing that the leader behind the operations of The Silk Road is still up for debate.\n\n“The defense has been [trying to show] that Karpeles was at least arguably ‘a’ Dread Pirate Roberts,” Forrest said. “They’re trying to raise reasonable doubts.”\n\nThe defense has also relied on what is called “The Princess Bride” theory, based on the classical book and movie where the audience doesn’t knows the true identity of the Dread Pirate Roberts. Many speculating on the trial have drawn parallels to the story because the main villain was named Dread Pirate Roberts, a criminal who never leaves captives alive. The film involves a case of leadership transfer and mistaken identities — the main argument of the defense in the Silk Road trial.\n\nUlbricht’s defense attorney is claiming there was a “Princess Bride” sort of switch behind capturing the real leader behind the Silk Road. They claim that the real Dread Pirate Roberts is still at large. That was reason enough for the federal judge to say one peculiar thing to the jury after giving them instructions about not discussing the trial publicly.\n\n“Don’t go watching ‘The Princess Bride’ this weekend,” she said.\n\nIf in fact the defense’s claims are correct and there was a transfer of leadership and a case of mistaken identities, then the story is a lot different for Ulbricht. And perhaps Karpeles. But again, that’s for a jury to decide.\n\nWhat The Case Means For Internet Freedom And Bitcoins\n\nOutside of what the jury determines is the fate of the accused Dread Pirate Roberts, this case is bigger than Ulbricht, bigger than Karpeles and bigger than bitcoins, says the group that’s campaigning for his innocence. Even with Ulbricht’s life on the line since he could face life in prison if convicted, the group has highlighted what this trial could mean for all cybersecurity cases, e-Commerce trade and the the freedom of the Internet. It’s also a case that could influence how bitcoins are traded and regulated.\n\n“[Silk Road] would be a device for leveraging the value of bitcoin, and if he could create a site independent of bitcoin, you could control the value of bitcoin,” Dratel said, reading from an email written by federal investigator DerYeghiayan.\n\nUlbricht’s advocacy group agrees.\n\n“This case represents the first challenge to the government’s attempt to expand the money laundering statute to include digital currency,” the advocacy group wrote.\n\nThey also have focused on the constitutional elements of the case.\n\n“If Ulbricht is convicted, it opens the door for the censure and erosion of a free Internet. Under present law, website hosts are not held responsible in civil cases for illegal actions on their sites. This case could set precedent and open the door to criminal liability for Web hosts,” the group claims. There appears to be a good amount of public support behind Ulbricht as of Jan. 16, $339,018 had been raised for his legal defense (Ironically, but also appropriate, bitcoins are one accepted currency on the fundraising site.)\n\nUlbricht has been charged with running the global marketplace where heroin, hacking services and fake passports were sold that amounted to more than $200 million sold through the anonymous Web browser and bitcoin. Turns out it wasn’t so anonymous and bitcoin wasn’t so untraceable — at least if the Fed’s story holds up in court.\n\n“The Silk Road was more than a drug bazaar, it was seen by many as a Libertarian experiment, a non-regulated market for mostly illegal but ‘victimless’ products and services such as forgeries, firearms, and software hacking tools,” wrote David Leveille for Public Radio International.\n\nAnd that’s the question some media outlets are asking: Is Ulbricht a criminal or is he a “geeky tech entrepreneur” and philanthropist? That will be up to the jury to decide. His official charges, all of which he’s plead not guilty to, include: narcotics trafficking; computer hacking; money laundering; engaging in a criminal enterprise; and conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent IDs.\n\nAccording to Andy Greenberg, who’s covering the Silk Road trial for Wired Magazine: “[Silk Road] was a one of its kind black market that really allowed you to buy any drug imaginable using the digital currency bitcoin and this anonymity system called Tor to hide your identity. So it was a completely anonymous, completely free market on the Internet.”\n\nGreenberg also said that the defense claimed that “when the Dread Pirate Roberts sensed that law enforcement was closing in, they tricked Ross Ulbricht into being the fall guy, they lured him back in and framed him.”\n\nSo just who is the Dread Pirate Roberts? People eyeing this case, particularly the free-market Internet activists who are backing Ulbricht think it’s more a case about the “Internet experiment in free commerce, not as a massive scheme to commit fraud or drug dealing scheme.”\n\nThat’s what really matters in this case, according to Greenberg. It’s less about the drugs, but more about where and how the drugs were being traded. And even more — what that could mean for government regulation over the Internet and the free trade of commerce.\n\n“[The Silk Road trial] is going to be a case study in how the government can attack these sites, where the vulnerabilities exist,” he wrote. “I think the administrators of these dark websites that still exist and that are making millions of dollars will be closely watching to see what weaknesses they might have and if the government tips its hand in any way about how it can find the chinks in their armor.”\n\nThere’s a lot of layers in this case, and plenty of drama that will unfold in the courtroom in the coming weeks. But what’s most important now — both from the defense and prosecutor’s side — is proving the one question everyone is asking: Is Ulbricht the real Dread Pirate Roberts?\n\nWhile the jury ponders his fate, Ulbricht, like Piper, will no doubt have the chance to make new friends, and who knows, even renew old Silk Road acquaintances.', 'The UK’s biggest banks have questioned the Chancellor’s attempts to make the UK a leading global centre for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.\n\nIn a submission to the Treasury’s consultation on the benefits and threats of digital currencies, the BBA has warned that Bitcoin and others pose major risks to consumers and to the financial system.\n\nThe BBA, which represents the major British banks including Barclays, Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland, has questioned the anonymity such currencies give to users, and the potential threat for them to be used for criminal or terrorist activities.\n\nBanks “need to be able to demonstrate that transactions are legitimate and that they are not supporting criminal or terrorist activity. At present ... [banks] are unclear on their responsibilities with regards to servicing those working with, paying or receiving digital currencies.”\n\nThe BBA, in a combined submission with the Payments Council, also warns of the potential instability such new currencies might cause.\n\n“If ‘convertible’ currencies were to reach mass adoption in the UK, there is a possibility that this may have an increasing effect on sterling. The Bank of England has noted that it is monitoring this,” the submission continues.\n\nMr Osborne launched the consultation in August last year, saying: “It’s only by harnessing innovations in finance, alongside our existing world class knowledge and skills in financial services, that we’ll ensure Britain’s financial sector continues to meet the diverse needs of businesses and consumers, here and around the globe, and create the jobs and growth we all want to see in the future.”\n\nAnthony Browne, chief executive of the BBA, told The Sunday Telegraph: “The reality is that if terrorists and criminals harness these unregulated currencies they will be far harder for the law enforcement and intelligence agencies to hunt down.”\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers have warned that new EU VAT rules could mean companies that take payment in Bitcoin could be breaking the law.From the start of the year, providers of digital goods and services online have been required to pay sales tax in the country where the buyer is located.\n\nRichard Croker, head of corporate tax at the City law firm CMS, said: “Companies accepting payment for cross-border online services in Bitcoin could be in violation because these rules require them to know and be able to show the taxman where their customers are.”', 'IBM has unveiled its proof of concept for ADEPT, a system developed in partnership with Samsung that uses elements of bitcoin’s underlying design to build a distributed network of devices – a decentralized Internet of Things.\n\nThe ADEPT concept, or Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry, taps blockchains to provide the backbone of the system, utilizing a mix of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake to secure transactions.\n\nIBM and Samsung chose three protocols – BitTorrent (file sharing), Ethereum (smart contracts) and TeleHash (peer-to-peer messaging) – to underpin the ADEPT concept. ADEPT was formally unveiled at CES 2015 in Las Vegas.\n\nAccording to the draft paper, blockchains deployed within the ADEPT system would serve as a ledger of existence for billions of devices that would autonomously broadcast transactions between peers in a three-tier system of peer devices and architecture. By using an implementation of the bitcoin protocol, ADEPT could serve as a bridge between many devices at low cost.\n\nThe paper adds:\n\n“Applying the blockchain concept to the world of [Internet of Things] offers fascinating possibilities. Right from the time a product completes final assembly, it can be registered by the manufacturer into a universal blockchain representing its beginning of life. Once sold, a dealer or end customer can register it to a regional blockchain (a community, city or state).""\n\nThe draft paper outlines a number of use cases, including several based in domestic settings. When CoinDesk spoke with chief architect Paul Brody in October, he noted that IBM was looking at how, in theory, implementations of the bitcoin protocol could change the way people live, in both big and small ways.\n\nBlockchains in the home\n\nIBM and Samsung envision networks of devices that are capable of autonomously maintaining themselves. In theory, the paper states, appliances in the home would be able to signal operational problems and retrieve software updates on their own. Devices could also use ADEPT to communicate with other nearby devices in order to facilitate power bartering and energy efficiency.\n\nThe authors explain:\n\n“We demonstrate how, using ADEPT, a humble washer can become a semi-autonomous device capable of managing its own consumables supply, performing self-service and maintenance, and even negotiating with other peer devices both in the home and outside to optimize its environment.”\n\n“All this is achieved without a central controller orchestrating or mediating between these devices,” the paper adds.\n\nAccording to the paper, a Samsung W9000 washing machine reconfigured to work within the ADEPT system uses smart contracts to issue commands to a detergent retailer in order to receive new supplies. These contracts give the device the ability to pay for the order itself and later receive word from the retailer that the detergent has been paid for and shipped.\n\nThis information would be broadcast to the smartphone of the washer’s owner, a device that would also be connected to that home’s network.\n\nChallenges remain\n\nCertain issues, including scalability and the nature of cryptocurrency development today, are cited as potential challenges for ADEPT should the concept ever be applied on a grander scale.\n\nThe ADEPT team addresses the issue of network scalability within the context of a distributed Internet of Things, and according to the authors, there are no clear paths forward to scale the system as-is to incorporate billions of devices, but that work in this area is promising.\n\nThey explain:\n\n“Multiple efforts like sidechains, treechains, and mini-blockchains are ongoing to address this problem. While each approach has its merits and demerits we are yet to see consensus on a common approach across the board. A blockchain to cater to hundreds of billions of devices needs to be scalable.”\n\nThe paper notes that challenges associated with Ethereum’s existing design as it relates to ADEPT’s proposed infrastructure could pose problems, saying that those concerns “are being addressed” as Ethereum moves toward its planned launch sometime this year. The authors also cited ongoing developments around anonymizing technology for cryptocurrency as potential areas where ADEPT could be impacted.\n\nThe full ADEPT draft paper can be found below:\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nIBM ADEPT Practictioner Perspective - Pre Publication Draft - 7 Jan 2015\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A new service called Tapeke aims to help you keep them organised, across all of your wallets and exchange accounts.\n\nTapeke was conceived by Nicolò Maria Lazzarin, one of the original user interface developers for the Hive wallet. Like a Mint.com for cryptocurrency users, it enables users to track bitcoin transactions in various ways – tracking multiple wallets in one interface and allowing them to assign metadata to their bitcoin addresses and transactions.\n\nUsers can tag transactions with category tags that they define, for example, and can then graph these categories, so that you could see how much you’ve spent on a particular area over a period of time. You can also tie contacts to particular bitcoin addresses, so that you can see how much you’ve sent over time to Bob, for example.\n\nCourting a mainstream user base\n\nWill Pangman, a bitcoin community organiser and company spokesperson, said that services like Tapeke would appeal to a broader bitcoin user base.\n\n“The user base is definitely there. People are only using bitcoin less than they want to because the tools aren’t there for the masses,” he said, adding:\n\n“Things like the basic conveniences of financial management for a person with bitcoin certainly didn’t exist at all a year ago, and lately they’re getting a bit better, but it still has a long way to go.”\n\nTapeke isn’t a wallet, but it hopes to complement wallets by providing a dashboard for financial information. One of the areas where Pangman thinks this could be helpful is in monitoring bitcoin ownership for tax purposes, for example.\n\nSeveral jurisdictions, including the US, have decided to impose capital gains tax on any value accrued on bitcoins in between acquisition and sale. That’s a big administrative overhead for the average user. A tool like this would provide a way of monitoring those changes in value, and it’s a business opportunity that others have already identified.\n\nThird-party integration\n\nTo do this effectively, though, the service will have to integrate with many other services.\n\nMint.com’s developers made significant efforts to court financial institutions for online data feeds. Tapeke will need to interface with several stakeholders, including bitcoin exchanges and wallets. That’s still a work in progress, Pangman conceded.\n\n“In the future, we will have integration with HD wallets and off-chain services, like Circle, Coinbase, and exchange accounts,” he said. “We are limiting ourselves to create occurrences. It could be a platform where any service could be pulled in and managed or analysed by the user with the confidence that they have a secure environment.”\n\nEven Hive Wallet, the founder of which is listed as an adviser to the company, hasn’t undertaken any third-party integration with the service. That's unsurprising, as Hive is a hierarchical deterministic wallet, which is a category of product that Pangman admits that Tapeke hasn't yet figured out integrations for.\n\nTapeke clearly has some way to go before it achieves the ubiquitous integration that Pangman is hoping for, but he claims that the nascent service is already getting lots of interest.\n\n“We have discussions with companies in the bitcoin space for integrating with us,” he said, adding that the ultimate goal is to give people a single point of access for multiple services, so that they don’t have to handle multiple logins for different cryptocurrency sites.\n\nExpansion plans\n\nSecurity has been a big concern for the development team, said Pangman. The site comes with three levels of security (basic, medium and advanced), with the top two encrypting user data.\n\nThe user data doesn’t include private keys, however, because the service doesn’t use those – storing only public keys in order to watch addresses, not make transactions. The encrypted data in question is the metadata, such as categories and contacts.\n\nThis is all part of a bigger plan for the bootstrapped firm, which was formed 12 months ago. In the longer term, it wants to go beyond exchange and wallet integration with an API for third party apps to integrate with. The idea is to create an app store with add-ons that will enhance the service, using events within Tapeke to trigger external actions.\n\n“If I build out the Tapeke account with some app integration, I can set some preferences so that certain activities I perform are triggering certain things that I want,” Pangman said.\n\nHe explained:\n\n“So I could set up my Tapeke account to let me know if there’s a 5% slide in the bitcoin price because I want to hedge, and then I could use this or that service.”\n\nThe system would also be able to suggest particular services to users based on such events, in the same way that Mint.com can, which is where its profit model comes in, said Pangman.\n\nIn the future, the company hopes to expand the service still further, covering altcoins, and perhaps even venturing into applications with custom tokens, should there be the demand.\n\n“We aren’t limiting ourselves to cryptocurrencies. It could be a service where any platform could be pulled in and managed or analysed by the user with the confidence that they will secure this environment,” he said.\n\nFirst thing’s first, though – Tapeke has to get some funding to start building out these additions to the service, which only went into beta on 1st January. Then, it will be able to put more weight behind a desktop app, which Pangman said is already in the works.\n\nMoney management image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That’s the question raised by Nonhumans.net, a project set up to recognize enemies from Nintendo classic The Legend of Zelda as a creative force.\n\n“One day I was rewiring The Legend of Zelda, hooking it up to other computer programs, when I discovered a secret: It turns out that monsters are surprisingly capable visual artists,” the ‘Extimate Operating Officer’ of the project (who does not share her or his real name) tells me.\n\n“I learned this when I patched their x/y coordinates into to a paint program, such that their motion controlled the digital brushes.

Nonhumans.net\n\nRead next: DIY at-home image transfers onto fabric and wood', 'NEW YORK (InsideBitcoins) — Recent bitcoin hacks serve as yet another reminder that bitcoin is still in a nascent state when it comes to security. The blockchain may be a public ledger, but it’s not as easy to track stolen funds as some people might think. Innovations like mixers and tumblers can move digital currency holdings to multiple bitcoin addresses, allowing privacy-seeking users to obscure their trail.\n\nDue to repeated and significant security lapses, governments all over the globe are beginning to consider tighter legislation on cryptocurrencies. According to Fabio Federici, CEO of Coinalytics, if people within the bitcoin community can create tools that help keep users safe from hacks, government regulators might be appeased – or perhaps of a mind to invoke less rigorous restrictions.\n\n“Security and regulation are going to be two big topics this year. Even though the blockchain is secure, vulnerabilities in other spaces, like we have seen with the Bitstamp case, could potentially cause major damage,” Federici told Inside Bitcoins.\n\nCoinalytics compiles data from the blockchain and converts it into user-friendly analytics. After Bitstamp had been hacked, the blockchain data analysts at Coinalytics decided to plug in available information and visualize the direction of where the coins were heading.\n\n“I think it’s good that we’ve shown that we can handle those issues,” he said. “Being able to show the regulators that we can deal with the bad actors, that we have tools to track fraudulent behavior and keep the end user safe, is going to put us in a favorable environment.”\n\nAt its core, bitcoin allows anonymous transactions by not linking specific identities to public keys. So tracking bitcoin through Coinalytics doesn’t bring users to a person, but rather a still anonymous public key.\n\nFederici noted that the platform isn’t being built for them to de-anonymize the blockchain; it’s being developed as a tool for businesses that fall victim to theft.\n\n“Our framework allows people to add additional information, like proprietary data, supercharging that data with insights from the blockchain,” Federici explained. “They can combine that with our insights from the blockchain and get a better look at what’s going on. Basically doing that last step, for example, is connecting an address or an output to an identity on their side.”\n\nIt’s a controversial notion: the fact that there are ways to allow for de-anonymizing bitcoin transactions. Recently, ChangeTip came under fire for their ability to connect Facebook, Reddit and Twitter profiles directly to bitcoin addresses. A Cornell professor was highly concerned that eventually, ChangeTip would sell that information to interested parties.\n\n“In terms of de-anonymizing it, I think we should really focus on making sure that we don’t go too far.”\n\n“The only way ChangeTip can command a higher revenue than a measly few thousand per year on their current business plan is by selling our information,” the professor said. “And they have two pieces of amazing information that no one else has.”\n\nChangeTip says they will never sell customer information.\n\nFederici too, says Coinalytics has no interest in linking people to their public keys via there service; they simply want to develop tools to study the data that the blockchain already allows.\n\n“The data is there. The blockchain is public and we’re really just building tools to give people the best possible access to that information,” he said. “In terms of de-anonymizing it, I think we should really focus on making sure that we don’t go too far.”', 'Ok, so maybe the whole Bitcoin mining thing didn’t work out. Maybe you are a day late, and a dollar short to play with the big boys in 2015. Maybe you need just one more shot to strike it rich in digital currency. If you don’t have a supercomputer that takes up an entire bedroom, it’s probably time for Plan B. That plan might include the newest digital currency called MangoCoinz.\n\n“What’s that?” you might ask? MangoCoinz is a new digital currency that lets you mine on your smartphone, so no mega-servers are required. It can be done away from home as well, or anywhere you can take your smartphone. This was created as an experiment for computer science last year, and the way, MangoCoinz are made, is with the actual motion of energy. As you and your Android smartphone move, you can create MangoCoinz while jogging, walking, or commuting. A new way to use your smartphone when you are not really using your smartphone. Here is more information on how MangoCoinz works, and why it may be right for you, if you are ready to become a mobile miner.\n\nHow does it work technically? Is it proof-of-work or proof-of-stake? How is it verified and work with Blockchain technology, or does it work through a separate protocol?\n\nIt has nothing to do with Bitcoin, all of the technology included in this coin is made by our dev team.\n\nHas it reached the exchanges yet, and can you go over the process of getting your new altcoin approved for online exchanges. How does that work?\n\nIt has reached exchanges, currently on two exchanges right now (usecryptos.com and https://www.atomic-trade.com). Exchanges can use our API to achieve full integration of MangoCoinz into their systems. This also works for other app developers that want to use MangoCoinz as a payment system in their products.\n\nIt seems to be Android-ready currently. Does it work with Apple’s iOS yet, and when will that happen?\n\nIt is Android-ready, but we will always keep developing new things and optimizing the existing system. We will start expanding into the iOS market, we already have plenty of people asking for this to hit the iPhone, but we currently lack proper financial means to do so.\n\nWho is your target demographic for this new coin?\n\nFirst we wanted to gather enough people who are well educated in the cryptocurrency world, just to see if something fresh like this can stick around for long enough, and we can say that it went pretty well. When thinking about how easy it is to start mining and using MangoCoinz, the next step for us would be to target the fitness industry. Give people that extra push for a run by rewarding them with money.\n\nThe system will be made 100% user friendly, meaning that in order to sell their coins, users only need to click a single button and our system will do the rest. We will also re-brand the coin and change the logo to make it more fitness-like.\n\nWhat are your goals for Mango Coinz by the end of 2015. What is your vision for Mango Coinz over the next year or two?\n\nOur vision for MangoCoinz is a cryptocurrency gone viral, a unique reward system for fitness lovers, but there is always room for innovative ideas on MangoCoinz usage.\n\nNew features like a Blockchain viewer and a rich username viewer are coming soon. An official MangoCoinz intro thread on bitcointalk.org is also scheduled for this month. Production is capped at 16.75 million MangoCoins, over 4 million less than Bitcoin.

Practically, they trick us into the meet-ups: we think we are coming to the Bitcoin meet-ups, but they are only pitching about their business. There is one company called Bitonic. And they say they are an exchange but they don’t have an order book; they just buy bitcoins from people and you can go to their website and buy bitcoins with iDeal via the bank. But you don’t get money directly. Sometimes you have to wait like a week to see the funds sent to your account, like a Mark Karpeles kind of thing. “And the banks wanted to close [Bitonic] because of the regulations. People do the scams like this, they buy bitcoins from their accounts or from phishing accounts, they send them to Bitonic and then they go to the bank and say ‘sorry guys but someone stole the money, there is no money and it went to some strange Bitonic account.’ So they call Bitonic and say ‘what is this?’ So such companies will always be a problem for banks.""\n\n—Annet de Boer (Arnhem Bitcoinstad/Cryptogeld/BitKassa) and Marek Skonieczny (Mr. Bitcoin)\n\n“And the embassy practically was the answer to all of this. Because the Bitonic lobby lost their case in court, they wanted 15,000 euro to reopen it and they put a QR-code on the Bitcoin Foundation website. […] So we should pay to lobby that Bitcoin is money. And during the meet-up they wanted to vote. So we said, ‘Listen guys, we understand that if this thing gets through and if bitcoins is money, you will be the only company in Holland who will have permission from the banks to operate and we, about sixty of us, will all be without jobs.”\n\nThe regulatory situation in the Netherlands, much like cannabis, is in a grey area when it comes to Bitcoin.\n\n“In Holland they don’t want any companies who deal with bitcoins because there is too much risk,” Marek explained. “Private people who have bank accounts and they go on bitcoin exchanges to buy bitcoins—[the banks] don’t care. But if you are a company, you get a call after one or two weeks and they tell you that you are using a bitcoin exchange and that they don’t accept that money.”\n\nHe also added:\n\n“If you have ‘Bit’ in your company name, forget about it.”\n\nIronically, these are the same Dutch banks like ING and ABN Amro that CoinTelegraph reported to be taking increasing interest in blockchain technology. I asked whether the cafe that hosts the embassy had any problems with the Dutch banks. “No,” replied Marek. “But that’s because [the owner] keeps all the bitcoins and doesn’t change them.”\n\nThus, opening up a Bitcoin company vis-a-vis the legacy banking system is rather difficult in Holland due to the perceived “risk” from banks and regulators.\n\nMarek continued:\n\n“Then the next day someone mysteriously paid the 15,000 euro and they reopened their case in court. So we were very angry. The next day on the ATM, we decided to put Dogecoin and Litecoin because we say if bitcoin is money then we want everything to be money, so that was our protest. “What is a Bitcoin foundation, a foundation is an organization that has no members, so practically there are three, four people on the board and they decide for a whole community. So we decided to do the embassy. We are not [officially] registered and we wanted to do it the Bitcoin way. So we have sponsors and they pay directly to the cafe owner. So if you look, it’s like we do not exist but we are still here, it’s like a well-organized club. Maybe we will register in the future on the blockchain instead of going the old-fashioned way of the last century.”\n\nHe also explained that he has been a member of the Bitcoin Foundation for the past two years and that last May, he decided to quit for the reasons aforementioned. “I told them that I quit,” said Marek, “and then they sent me a honorary membership so I couldn’t even quit the foundation.”\n\nNow, Amsterdam’s Bitcoin locals have another option and the embassy’s opening night was a great success with “people coming from all over Europe, England, London, Brussels, etc.” He envisions the venue to be the center for all Bitcoin-related activities in Amsterdam and says it is needed to foster the growing interest in cryptocurrencies among locals and sojourners, despite admitting that it “will be very empty in the beginning.”\n\nMarek is an ardent Bitcoin believer and never misses an opportunity to familiarize people with the new technology. “I have AirBnB with 25 people passing through every month,” he told me. “Every single one is leaving with a bitcoin wallet and one dollar. And we have some people coming back already.”\n\nAnd despite the slow adoption pace, we both agreed that Bitcoin has already succeeded in one major way, particularly in hindsight when looking at the financial crisis of 2008, for example, before the advent of cryptocurrencies.\n\n“The beautiful thing about Bitcoin is that 5 years ago we were not ready for the collapse of this [financial system] scheme. And right now at least we know that there is an alternative. If it collapses, then we still have our money.”\n\n—Bitcoin Embassy mug alongside with the mug of a sponsor\n\nSince one of the most popular analogies is comparing Bitcoin to the internet, I asked Marek in what year he thinks we are currently, in terms of Bitcoin’s progression. He replied:\n\n“I still think we’re sitting with Steve Jobs in the shed. We just finished building the wooden apple.”\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

William Mougayar is an entrepreneur turned angel investor, founder of Startup Management, and currently raising his first fund.\n\n“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” – Buckminster Fuller\n\nThe bitcoin train is really made up of two revolutions in one: money and finance, based on the bitcoin protocol, and exploiting the “currency programmability” aspects; and decentralized applications, based on the blockchain’s distributed technology capabilities.\n\nBoth are grounded in similar roots (crypto-technology), but they have different branching. Both paths are creating disruptive, innovative and system-changing opportunities for startups, investors, consumers and business players. Both are joined at the hip, and that hip is the blockchain, the backbone of crypto-based transactions.\n\nTo fully understand the blockchain concept and the benefits of cryptography in computer science, we need to first understand the concept of “decentralized consensus,” a key tenet of the crypto-based computing revolution.\n\nDecentralized consensus breaks the old paradigm of centralized consensus, i.e. when one central database used to rule transaction validity. A decentralized scheme (which the bitcoin protocol is based on) transfers authority and trust to a decentralized network and enables its nodes to continuously and sequentially record their transactions on a public “block,” creating a unique “chain” — the blockchain. Cryptography (via hash codes) is used to secure the authentication of the transaction source and removes the need for a central intermediary. The combination of cryptography and blockchain technology together ensures there is never a duplicate recording of the same transaction.\n\nThis degree of unbundling is enabling a new way of writing software, and it is a spark of innovation for money- and non-money-related decentralized applications.\n\nThere are different flavors of crypto-technology-related implementations. Some are based on the bitcoin blockchain itself and others on an independent decentralized one. Some are based on the bitcoin currency and others on alternative cryptocurrencies or branded tokens. All these various permutations are creating a rich ecosystem environment for cryptocurrency-based innovations.\n\nTo say that bitcoin and its sole blockchain hold a monopoly on the future of cryptocurrency-based implementations is like saying in 2006 that LinkedIn was the only social network needed when it was barely leading, and when Facebook, Twitter and many other social platforms were still babies.\n\nWe need to view what is happening today as a rich ecosystem that represents the best blend of computer and cryptography science, and not just as an ecosystem of bitcoin-centric technologies.\n\nA future that relies only on bitcoin and its blockchain is simply not possible. The cat is already out of the bag, and innovation around cryptocurrency technologies is racing. At the center of it, trust is shifting from humans and central organizations to computers and decentralized organizations with an underlying decentralized consensus that governs them.\n\nIf the social web dominated the period of 2004-2014, the next 10 years might as well belong to the trust web.\n\nWhat most people don’t realize is that bitcoin is just a protocol, and a pretty low-level one to start with. Any heavy lifting happens on top of it, just as TCP/IP is the Internet’s protocol and a pretty low-level one. The ecosystem in and around bitcoin is actually helping to enrich bitcoin, more than weaken it.\n\nCompanies and projects such as Ethereum, Blockstream, Maidsafe, Mastercoin, Counterparty, Stellar, Factom, Codius and NXT are innovating with new technologies, services and applications that are pushing or testing the limits of Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision.\n\nToday, the bitcoin landscape is still murky, but patterns are emerging. The picture isn’t totally clear, but here’s an inventory of where we are seeing some of the most exciting and promising entrepreneurial activity, both in the money and decentralized applications segments.\n\nMoney services\n\nIf you live in the Western world, or a relatively developed country, your banking system and currency are typically stable, and you’re probably happy with the services offered. But according to studies, half the world is unbanked and undocumented, and more than 4 billion people still don’t have Internet access.\n\nTo peer into the future of decentralized banking for the masses, look no further than the success of easypaisa in Pakistan and M-Pesa in Kenya. They are both SMS-based, cell phone-centric banking services that enjoy a wide user adoption for paying bills, transferring money, buying goods and services, and several other types of transactions. Easypaisa already holds more than a 50 percent market share in mobile financial transactions in Pakistan, and M-Pesa enjoys more than 70 percent market usage penetration in Kenya (higher than Facebook’s), and accounts for over 30 percent of that country’s GDP.\n\nYou might think that SMS-based transactions are a pretty simplistic scheme, but that may be exactly what’s needed: a return to simplicity. Bitcoin is all about that.\n\nMicrotransactions and money transfer\n\nBitcoin is perfect for micro-transactions. There is no reason why any web transaction under $10 shouldn’t be done using bitcoin. Credit cards or PayPal really have no place at the low-end of transaction value because transaction fees easily eat into the total transaction itself. Some of the early applications include tipping for a variety of reasons (appreciation, reward, donations, etc.) or as promotional gifts for marketing purposes. Some bloggers are even adding tipping buttons on their sites, perhaps signaling that tipping is the new “liking.”\n\nOn the higher end of money operations, money transfers are ideally suited for bitcoin’s native network structure, and the $400 billion-plus global remittance market is waiting to get disrupted, as bitcoin is lowering the costs of transmitting money by orders of magnitude in speed and simplicity. Further, we will soon become regular users of cryptocurrency wallets with built-in logic that will allow you to initiate money transfers or payments via programmatic conditions or rules that are based on smart contracts.\n\nMoney as content\n\nOne could argue that bitcoin will have a more significant impact than the Internet itself because the Internet didn’t have its own currency. The Internet was missing a native currency, and bitcoin is just that. We can think of bitcoin as an unbundled piece of content, just like content is unbundled all over the Internet; yet it appears well-integrated in websites, applications and services.\n\nBitcoin allows money to take a new meaning. If you think of this in evolutionary terms, we used to have content in printed newspapers and magazines, then the Internet came along, and allowed content to move aggressively to digital formats. Content that wanted to be free, became freed up on the Internet, and that created new forms of innovations on top of those models. With cryptocurrency, we can easily decouple the transaction logic from the money itself. Bitcoin will become gradually integrated and embedded right into the fabric of the Internet, and we will see it as native content itself.\n\nBlockchain technology stack\n\nThere is a new technology topology that is forming for building applications on top of the bitcoin protocol.\n\nJoel Monegro of USV has suggested a five-layer architecture that is blockchain-agnostic: miners and the blockchain; overlay networks; decentralized protocols; open source and commercial APIs; and applications. It is a good depiction of where we’re headed. Whether that exact topology or a variation of it is realized doesn’t matter a lot.\n\nWhat matters more is that the blockchain concepts, and related technologies are sparking the imaginations of builders and developers who are innovating the form of services, protocols, infrastructure and applications that are decentralized. They are yielding increased consumer power, greater personal data ownership and reduced transaction costs, over the long term.\n\nDigital rights and smart property\n\nIf you’re a creator or owner of digital assets, imagine if you could link these assets to the blockchain, binding your ownership (or rights) in irrevocable ways that cannot be undone unless you decide to transfer or sell them. And it’s all within your own control, not someone else’s.\n\nIn essence, you would be creating a “smart property,” which is an asset or thing that knows who owns it. The blockchain can be used as an auditable database linked to your cryptographic signature, and your smart property becomes linked to a unique digital fingerprint based on its content. Now imagine the portability, flexibility and discoverability aspects that accompany these capabilities, and that becomes a great lubricator for decentralized peer-to-peer trading and commerce.\n\nCompanies like Mine are enabling creators to establish a persistent link between their identity, reputation, a digital file and its meta-data using the blockchain as the proof of ownership. This will unleash new marketplace opportunities for trading these assets securely and efficiently.\n\nSmart contracts based on “proof of work”\n\nA smart contract is equivalent to a little program that you can entrust with money and rules around that money. The basic idea behind smart contracts is that a transaction’s contractual governance between two or more parties can be verified programmatically via the blockchain instead of via a central arbitrator, rule maker or gatekeeper.\n\nWhy depend on a central authority if two (or more) parties can agree between themselves after they bake the terms and implications of their agreement programmatically and conditionally? And do so with automatic money releases, while fulfilling services in a sequential manner or pay penalties, if not fulfilled?\n\nAt the heart of this undertaking is the key concept of “proof of work,” an integral part of Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision for the blockchain’s role as the unequivocal authenticator of transactions.\n\nThe proof of work is a “right” to participate in the blockchain system. Expect a not-too-distant future where smart contracts based on proof of work and smart property will be dispensed and executed routinely. Smart contracts are potentially Ethereum’s sweet spot, as they represent its atomic unit at the code level, allowing anyone to write them, along with their own rules.\n\nDecentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces\n\nDecentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces are a stepped-up evolution from what we have today in the most successful marketplaces (e.g. Uber, eBay, Amazon). Actually, decentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces threaten to replace some of these existing players that operate semi-centralized markets.\n\nIn a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace, anyone sells and anyone buys, while the center controls less but facilitates more. Trust, rules, identity, reputation and payment choices are embedded at the peer level. Participants arrive already trusted and decentrally acknowledged.\n\nExamples of marketplaces and services to support them are being concocted by startups, such as La’zooz for transportation, or OpenBazaar for P2P trading. A decentralized P2P marketplace has a lot less friction at the center than traditional marketplaces. There are a lot more power and benefits at the edges than at the center. Here’s a more detailed description of the characteristics and behaviors of decentralized P2P marketplaces.\n\nCryptoequity\n\nNot only does bitcoin allow companies to mint their own currencies and tie its appreciation to their success, it can also support the full life cycle of equity issuance, governance and trading.\n\nClassical stock offerings could be replaced by a crypto-crowdfunding scheme. The meaning of “equity” is unbundled, and it is reconfigured on the blockchain, therefore potentially re-evaluating the legal nature of the corporation. This particular scenario is also related to the concept of distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs), as fully automated business entities that run by interacting with autonomous agents that contribute to its value appreciation by virtue of the collective intelligence and actions of its users.\n\nThis will allow organizations to have global IPOs from day one of their operations. Although the ramp-up can be slow, value is initially commensurate with the maturity of operations, and as users contribute more value to the decentralized operations, overall value and equity continue to increase. Companies like Swarm are enabling cryptoequity-in-a-box, along with sophisticated programmable governance based on smart contracts building blocks.\n\nDecentralized identity\n\nYour identity is yours and no one else’s. We keep our own passport (although it’s tied to a country) and use it to go anywhere, because it’s widely accepted, but we can hardly move or use our identity from one website to another.\n\nWhy not decentralize our identities (and even online reputations), along with their parameters, and own them ourselves? Why can’t we arrive at websites or web services with our own identities and move around that way? A decentralized identity opens the doors to a variety of interesting decentralized applications. Openname is working on decentralized identity as a building block protocol for decentralized applications.\n\nA tech renaissance as the path forward\n\nFor bitcoin to succeed, we need to approach the new things that were not possible before. Copying the current system is only a starting point. It’s better to invent new things instead of fighting all things, and it’s easier to create new systems that circumvent the old ones. Of course, bitcoin can replicate some of what is currently being done, but that’s not where most of the interesting developments are.\n\nTo see innovation, you need to look at the applications and usages inside new, pure bitcoin spaces, ones that are not constrained by the cumbersome legacies of the past.\n\nThink about new spaces and businesses where you own your identity online, bind your digital assets to the blockchain, and accept payments or get paid in bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, without the need to have an existing bank account. Think about choosing the rules of doing business via smart contracts that protect you. Then attach yourself as a node onto a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace in order to get discovered and do business.\n\nThat is the future of the trust web\n\nBitcoin’s economic success will not depend on a permission to transfer value to it from other financial assets. Bitcoin is its own currency and has its own technology stack, and it is creating its own wealth. Bitcoin’s native wealth creation will dwarf the current value we see from the transfer of fiat money into wallets (approximately $5 billion as of December 2014). Fiat transfers were just a starting point to boot it up.\n\nThat’s why going head-on against existing stakeholders and regulators is a futile exercise. The bitcoin economy growth will come from the creation and appreciation of its own value around its own ecosystem. For example, users will be paid in cryptocurrency in exchange for real services, decentralized apps members will add crypto value to decentralized organizations by virtue of their actions, and new crypto tokens will continue to be mined and linked to the creation of new business models built on top of blockchain protocols.\n\nThis is all starting to happen, and it is unstoppable. It’s more than a new paradigm. It’s a renaissance for technology, computer science and cryptography.\n\nFeatured Image: nuvolanevicata/Shutterstock', ""Day two of The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) was perhaps most notable for an absence of expected speakers, including Blockstream’s Adam Back, Bitstamp COO Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux and GAW Miners CEO Josh Garza, all of whom canceled scheduled appearances.\n\nHowever, the development may have been fitting given that the event succeeded at highlighting themes in the industry as opposed to any one individual, with security as the most visible topic of the day.\n\nA number of speeches and roundtables addressed security in both specific and abstract ways. The ongoing issue of how to make bitcoin more secure, whether that means boosting its struggling cloud mining sector, upgrading exchanges and wallets or developing a strategy for existential threats like regulation, seemed present in many sessions.\n\nDave Ripley, CEO of bitcoin wallet startup Glidera, summed up one of the most commonly cited aspects of this conversation, the security of consumer funds, telling CoinDesk:\n\n“Security is solved for the very technologically savvy user, it’s definitely not solved for the mainstream user.”\n\nSteven Sprague, whose security startup Rivetz presented at day one’s startup stage, articulated this point more specifically, touching on security with a nuance that is often lost in the mainstream media coverage of bitcoin.\n\n“I think everybody understands that the blockchain is an amazing piece of technology, but there’s another half of it, which is ‘How do I send instructions to the blockchain?’”\n\nThis emphasis was echoed by TNABC organizer Moe Levin, who told CoinDesk he believes the big question on display at the event was the ongoing battle between convenience and security. However, he suggested other topics might have suffered in light of this emphasis.\n\n“I don’t think enough time was given to how mass consumer adoption will happen this year,” said Levin.\n\nIn his closing address, Levin provided an appropriate dramatic weight to this conversation, advising the industry:\n\n“We’re at a juncture now, we must make wise decisions to ensure bitcoin’s success.”\n\nBitGo on security in 2016\n\n“We’ve had too many hacks, too many losses.”\n\nBitGo CEO Will O’Brien issued this statement early in the day’s proceedings in a talk that focused on his company’s multi-signature bitcoin wallet technology, as well as the larger struggles of the industry to provide users better security.\n\nO’Brien notably illustrated how he expects security to advance in the year ahead. His most direct prediction may have been that 2015 will see the industry adopt a ‘multi-institutional’ security standard that will see companies sharing the responsibility of holding and securing private keys.\n\n“By the end of this year, it will no longer be acceptable for one company to hold all the keys to a wallet,” O’Brien said.\n\nThe statements could signal a trend given that 2014 was framed as the ‘year of multisig’ by many in the industry.\n\nButerin talks sustainable growth\n\nEthereum’s Vitalik Buterin was in attendance for a talk billed as being about the crypto 2.0 industry, though it was geared more specifically toward providing a high-level view of what makes decentralization valuable.\n\nButerin naturally touched on the issues inherent with centralization; framing bitcoin as just one of many already commonly used forms of decentralized technology, though one with real uses cases.\n\nFor example, Buterin cited web link rot, whereby older outdated links die when the websites they direct to are not longer maintained, as a pressing mainstream issue that could be solved by the community.\n\n“If all these websites were stored on a decentralized network, they would at least live forever, or as long as somebody cared about them,” Buterin joked.\n\nButerin also outlined his five-layer overview of the crypto 2.0 space, a loose category term he said for what has become a “convergence of different technologies”. Overall, his talk was able to articulate how these developing parts of the ecosystem intend to work together, even if the specific details have yet to be determined.\n\nMining at a crossroads\n\nSecurity was also top of mind during a mining panel that included BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov, Bitmain’s Yoshi Goto, Spondoolies-Tech CEO Guy Corem, Aquifer’s Anthony Brough, and developer Luke Dash. The panel was moderated by Tally Capital’s Matthew Roszak.\n\nThe talk began ominously with Corem describing the ongoing issues in the cloud mining segment of the bitcoin industry, as pervasive, stating:\n\n”Cloud mining is a real problem for us, there’s lots and lots of ponzi schemes.”\n\nCorem decried some cloud mining companies as “ticking bombs”, making clear that he thinks the issues in the industry are far from over.\n\nVavilov, whose bitcoin mining company has raised $40m to date, positioned himself as the member of the group perhaps most willing to find solutions to the issue.\n\n“I may be an optimist, but I see the opportunity,” he said.\n\nElsewhere, Bitmain’s Goto indicated that his company was exploring solutions that would help it provide a stable cloud mining product.\n\nCloud mining companies aim to allow consumers a way to profit from bitcoin mining without the requirements of managing and operating the machines.\n\nGAW Miners Q&A canceled\n\nPerhaps most notably, a much-anticipated Q&A with GAW Miners CEO Josh Garza did not take place as expected.\n\nThe event, drummed up by bitcoin’s rabid Reddit supporters, had all the anticipation of a heavyweight bout. On the morning of today's event, for instance, two of the top four posts were dedicated to deriding Garza and the paycoin project.\n\nPreviously, Garza had agreed to participate in a session to be moderated by a member of the bitcoin community that addressed the controversies surrounding his company’s proposed bitcoin competitor, paycoin.\n\nThe project recently became embroiled in scandal for actions related to the launch of paycoin, including the planned market support for the project. GAW Miners has notably launched a buyback program for the altcoin, which seeks to alleviate customer complaints.\n\nGAW Miners was a sponsor of this year's TNABC.\n\nStartup stage packs surprises\n\nIf some main speakers were noticeably absent, day two of the startup stage saw the surprise appearance of some companies not advertised on the TNABC schedule.\n\nThis edition of the event featured distributed storage startup Stroj, bitcoin wallet Airbitz, blockchain rewards program Ribbit.me, decentralized prediction market Augur, Zimbabwe-based bitcoin ATM startup Crypto Counter, bitcoin wallet KrypotKit and crypto 2.0 startup Tether.\n\nThe panel of judges, including Roszak, Liberty.me’s Andrew Filipowski, Pantera Capital’s Steve Waterhouse and developer Peter Todd, was sometimes difficult on the startups, asking them pointed questions about their security and market strategy.\n\nOne of the more well-received startups was Tether, which seeks to provide users a way to move fiat currencies on the bitcoin blockchain. However, it also showed the limits of decentralized technology in its current state, explaining that it still uses banks to account for fiat dollars.\n\n“Fiat goes into a bank account, it’s audited and the number of tethers in circulation will be audited by the blockchain,” CEO Reeve Collins said.\n\nOverall, the judges seemed split on the sum of the presentations, however.\n\nTodd, a known security advocate, was less impressed, stating bluntly: “Some of this stuff didn’t convince me it would work.”\n\nRoszak, however, was more positive, speaking in his remarks to the excitement that many still feel about the industry despite its recent struggles.\n\n“Love the energy, innovating on the blockchain, we need a lot more of this,” Roszak said.\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk; TNABC\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

You may also be interested in reading these ones:', 'An interest in bitcoin and digital currency makes Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis vice president and research director David Andolfatto something of a rarity among Fed officials. However, while he may see the technology’s big picture, why he believes bitcoin is potentially transformative doesn’t exactly fall in line with the common mantras of the community.\n\nTake, for instance, the claim that bitcoin is part of a long-term trend toward “digital money”, one Andolfatto delights in debunking.\n\nToday, virtually all money used by the private banking sector, and all the money in modern economies, he asserts, is digital.\n\nIn a conversation with CoinDesk, Andolfatto went so far as to suggest that the bitcoin network isn’t that much different from the Federal Reserve, and that while ideologically opposed, both are highly similar in their structure and goals. The St Louis Fed is just one of 12 banks that make up the US Federal Reserve System, which supervises state-member banks, bank holding companies and loan holding companies, and provides educational outreach.\n\nAndolfatto said:\n\n“The way I view the Fed, and any institution, is it’s basically a computer program. Just like bitcoin, it’s an open-source computer program. You ask yourself, ‘What is bitcoin?’ It’s a protocol, it’s a computer program, it’s a constitution, it’s a law, it’s a legal code, it’s basically a constitution that governs the supply of its money and that governs the processing of payments.”\n\nStill, Andolfatto does believe bitcoin has one key advantage that he has called its “stroke of genius” in past presentations – its open-source decentralized ledger known as the blockchain.\n\nIn contrast to the Federal Reserve Wire Network (Fedwire), the US central bank’s real-time settlement system, Andolfatto believes bitcoin, or a similar blockchain-based system could pose real benefits for centralised financial institutions like the Fed.\n\nThe comments come as part of a wide-ranging interview that sought to gather Andolfatto’s opinion on bitcoin as a currency, payment network and financial tool that could grow in relevance to the global economy.\n\nBitcoin\'s competitive edge\n\nWith digital money out of the running as the big innovation behind bitcoin, Andolfatto has turned his interest to another often-cited aspect of the technology – its public ledger system, the blockchain.\n\nStill, he questions whether the bitcoin network will prove to be more cost-effective than other available payment systems, and whether another similar system might ultimately solve the key problems he still sees in its design.\n\n“The amount of money and resources you have to pay bitcoin miners is like 3% of all transactions,” he said. “That’s kind of like what Visa charges.”\n\nWith these often-cited benefits out of the running, however, Adolfatto is still interested in bitcoin because of one key benefit it has over the current system used by the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy using a distributed ledger, he said, every bank in the Federal Reserve system could have a copy of all transactions in the system, thereby guarding against potential problems inherent with a centralized approach.\n\n“What would happen on the distributed ledger is all the books would be kept simultaneously in every one of these member banks, the same way that the blockchain is on everybody’s computer,” he said. “If any one computer goes down, that doesn’t in any way violate the integrity of the blockchain because the records still exist on all these copies of this ledger.”\n\nAndolfatto indicated that such a feature could add a “robustness” to the Fed’s existing system, potentially even allowing the public more transparency during times of economic turmoil.\n\n“You could actually see which bank is sending money to which bank on this ‘Fedcoin blockchain’, so if the Fed was to make an emergency loan to one of these entities you’d be able to observe who is the recipient of the loan and how much,” he theorized.\n\nBut if the bitcoin system has advantages, Andolfatto isn’t ready to make the case that they should be embraced by the Fed. Andolfatto cautioned that he doesn’t see the immediate need for financial institutions to migrate to public ledgers.\n\n“To the extent that people would value that transparency – and I have to say that it’s not immediately clear you want that type of transparency – that would be another benefit,"" he said.\n\nBitcoin as a currency\n\nIn the past, Andolfatto has been bearish on bitcoin as a currency, arguing that distributed payment systems like Ripple come closest to unlocking the full power of bitcoin’s original ledger.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he indicated that he doesn’t see the uptick in the merchant adoption of bitcoin as payment a sign that this conjecture might be wrong.\n\n“People use all sorts of stuff as currency,” Andolfatto said. “There’s many, many currencies out there and the bitcoin currency is just one.”\n\nAndolfatto countered with the assertion that, rather than a currency, bitcoin is considered by most to be an investment vehicle, a development he suggested might limit its ability to function more broadly as money.\n\n“People see that in the long run the supply of bitcoin is capped and they see it’s demand growing, so in the long run you have to expect that it might be a good investment vehicle,” he said. “You might think the same about gold, but just because something’s a good investment vehicle does not make it a good currency.”\n\nAndolfatto ended by citing the volatile exchange rate between bitcoin and US dollars, a subject that has been the subject of increasing attention in recent weeks.\n\n“What makes a good currency is its ability to hold its value for very, very short periods of time,” he said, adding the caveat that developing markets where money is managed poorly might come to contradict his theory.\n\nHe continued, “I think there might be a big scope for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to replace or at least take a good market share of currency transactions [in these areas].""\n\nComparisons to Fedwire\n\nPerhaps most surprising was Andolfatto’s assertion that the bitcoin network is similar to the Federal Reserve, but he elaborated at length on the subject and why he believes all money is just a ledger.\n\nIn this context, he explained that all money attempts to perform a simple function, debiting an account and crediting another.\n\n“Fedwire uses the US dollar as the currency unit and the Fed serves as the third party that does the accounting,” he said. “The key difference with bitcoin is that there’s no trusted third party to do the accounting. The accounting is done by this community of miners, this decentralized system. It’s a completely different philosophy.”\n\nStill, he sees the Federal Reserve as an evolving system, one that is also “open source” due to its reliance of foundational laws.\n\n“The Fed is a set of rules that evolved over time, much like the open-source bitcoin protocol does. It takes feedback from the community, in this case the community votes, represented by the Congress. Congress is the creator of the Fed, and so there are amendments to the way the fed might operate. As long as this occurs, I see the Fed as an open-source evolving protocol, much like bitcoin,” he said.\n\nMore pressing issues\n\nWhile Andolfatto admits that he has followed the development of the bitcoin ecosystem, it wasn’t an intellectual curiosity that first lead him to speak out as part of his institution’s “Dialogue With the Fed” series. Rather, it was the work of a savvy PR team.\n\n“This is an earlier in [2014] and public interest in the phenomenon was really cresting. It was one of those things our public affairs team identified as something we wanted to know more about,” Andolfatto recalled.\n\nHe indicated that, while the darling of the mainstream tech and finance press, most Federal Reserve economists aren’t thinking about bitcoin. Of the 1,000 or more on staff, he said that he is aware of just “pockets of researchers” that have looked at the issue.\n\n“The thing to keep in mind is that there’s a lot on the minds of fed economists these days,” he added.\n\nStill, he said he is encouraged by what he’s seen of the bitcoin ecosystem, particularly the technology’s enthusiastic fan base, which he cites as key to his never-say-never view of developments in the industry.\n\n“My experience with meeting people [in the industry] has been highly, highly positive,” Andolfatto said. “They might not have a good understanding of money, monetary policy and macroeconomics and stuff like that, but they have a very, very good idea of the payment system, of how it works, the plumbing, and moreover and I\'ve come away marveling at the energy and the ingenuity that these people have.”\n\nHe added: “I mean the entrepreneurs in this space, I am just in awe of.”\n\nImages courtesy of the St Louis Fed\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'NEW YORK (InsideBitcoins) — It’s been nearly one year since the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) laid the framework for the tax treatment of cryptocurrency, categorizing bitcoin and all other “virtual currencies” as property.\n\n“If a virtual currency is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, the fair market value of the virtual currency is determined by converting the virtual currency into U.S. dollars (or into another real currency which in turn can be converted into U.S. dollars) at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied,” said the IRS notice.\n\nSome day traders make it their full-time job to watch trends and place quick bets. Along with that, are groups of day traders that utilize bots for automatic trades. Needless to say, record keeping can be quite a chore. According to Colin Mackie, creator of the tax tool BitcoinTaxes, formerly known as Bitcointax.info, anyone coming to tax season with little or no documentation is still responsible for reporting their transactions.\n\n“The responsibility does, unfortunately, fall on the taxpayer to keep records,” Mackie told Inside Bitcoins. “If they were audited, this burden of proof is on them to show what they are claiming is valid and correct.”\n\nFortunately, most exchanges and wallets have been implementing tools for customers to receive the needed documentation. Still, users without any obtainable records should seek professional tax advice, says Mackie, and they are likely going to need to estimate their tax liability from the records they have on hand.\n\nCapital gains and losses\n\nAs with any investment, bitcoin traders need to account for capital gains and losses. For example, if someone purchased one bitcoin at an exchange rate of $600, they would need to report when they sold that bitcoin, the market value at the time of the sale, as well as whether it was at for a gain or a loss.\n\n“This year is going to be a complete reversal of what we saw from last, where those reported gains and capital gains taxes will be somewhat undone by the filing of losses generated in 2014,”\n\nAccording Mackie, capital gains and losses are going to be a study in contrasts for tax year 2014 as compared to 2013, considering the price declined from near $1000 to almost $300 — with plenty of ups and downs in between.\n\n“This year is going to be a complete reversal of what we saw from last, where those reported gains and capital gains taxes will be somewhat undone by the filing of losses generated in 2014,” Mackie told Inside Bitcoins. “Since wash sales don’t apply to Bitcoins, there was likely a large number of people selling off during December in order to create tax losses for their 2014 filing. Even those that didn’t may well be thinking about it right now whilst we watch the downward trend continue.”\n\nHis interest is in how the IRS will respond to the mass amount of capital losses following a year of such high capital gains. According to a recent IRS report to Congress, taxpayers this year are likely to receive the worst levels of taxpayer service since 2001, resulting in the closing of very few audit cases in the coming year. Mackie wonders if the IRS has more important things to worry about than losses, but still believes it could be an issue.\n\n“2013 was probably a revenue windfall for the IRS with the unexpected extra capital gains taxes from the large increases over the year,” Mackie explained. “However, this year, some of those people might well be undoing a lot of those paid taxes with losses. Fortunately for the IRS, the income deduction is capped at $3,000 for investors, although they can be carried forward into 2015 and beyond. A warning, however, if you try and file as a ‘trader’ to avoid that cap is it will likely raise an audit flag.”\n\nTax tools to lend a helping hand\n\nBitcoinTaxes has an alternative to the bookkeeping mess, for anyone from day-traders to businesses and regular users. People can go to their site and import their trades, income and spending transactions. By obtaining a comma-separated values file (CSV) from exchanges such as Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken or Coinbase, users can input their bitcoin transactions and let the tool create their report. It even has options for the bitcoin core wallet and Blockchain.info.\n\nSimilar to the process that BitcoinTaxes uses, LibraTax handles tax accounting as well. It allows for importing transactions from Blockchain.info, Coinbase and CSV files and calculates capital gains and losses.\n\n“Our primary objective is to have approachable, convenient software that simplifies the end-user experience associated with taxpaying — ultimately saving users precious time and money. We’ve accomplished that without a doubt,” said LibraTax CEO Jake Benson, in a product release statement last summer.\n\nQuestions on future taxation still linger\n\nWhile the tax guidelines in place certainly set the groundwork for how the government will handle cryptocurrency, there’s a lot of questions that remain unanswered.\n\n“This was really a minimum and there are still areas to be clarified,” Mackie said, rattling off a list of unanswered questions. “How is the income of mined coined determined if there is no direct USD market? Are consumers really expected to record every purchase they make with Bitcoin and report it as a sale of asset? Do alt-coin trades benefit from like-kind treatments?”\n\nAll of these questions have no answer for the 2014-2015 tax season. Assuming that the IRS is still concerned with taxing all cryptocurrencies, it’s expected that a revised guideline will emerge after the upcoming tax season. Any quick changes could lead to less tax revenue to the IRS, making it difficult to put anything into place until audits are challenged and new rules are constructed.', 'Quietly, and to little fanfare this week, a new project emerged which may give us an early glimpse of what the internet of the future will look like. Going under the name ZeroNet, it combines torrents, the decentralized system of file sharing, with the cryptography of Bitcoin. The result of that marriage is a system for publishing and editing websites which is entirely decentralized and therefore resistant to both criminal hacking and government censorship.\n\nA growing body of computer scientists and engineers are coming to the conclusion that decentralization, with its myriad of benefits in terms of privacy, security and economics, is going to be the key feature of the next generation of internet technologies – sometimes called ‘web 3.0’.\n\nA number of high profile cryptocurrency start-ups are currently working on producing exactly that: a set of technologies to allow people to publish websites without the need for central servers to host them. Maidsafe, for example, is building its own web 3.0 infrastructure for decentralized apps on top of a distributed storage solution which shreds files and stores them across many different machines. Ethereum, another major cryptocurrency project which held a record-breaking crowdsale in 2014, is also seeking to build a decentralized web 3.0 solution, as are smaller projects such as XCurrency.\n\nZeroNet’s solution uses torrents to share a website’s files (html, css, etc). Users wishing to visit a ZeroNet website will first download its files (html, css, etc) using torrent-like software, allowing the website to then run itself locally on their machine. These sites are accessed through the browser, and apart from the web address they look like any other website. After visiting a site like this, the user will then begin ‘seeding’ those same files to other users.\n\nCurrently Bitcoin’s cryptography is used to by a website’s owner to verify ownership of the site, allowing them to edit its files. This is done ‘offline’ without producing a transaction on the Bitcoin network itself. ZeroNet developer shortcutme told NewsBTC, however, that additional applications of cryptocurrency technology are being considered for the future, such as the use of Namecoin’s decentralized DNS to allow for human-readable domain names.\n\nZeroNet can be viewed and downloaded from GitHub here: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet', ""While P2P loans are potentially risky investments, they have provided investors with exceptional returns over the last six years. Unless the economy takes a major turn for the worse, I believe that P2P loans should continue to provide investors with high single-digit returns.\n\nWhat are P2P loans?\n\nEssentially, they are unsecured personal loans to individuals living in the United States. For example, a borrower may want to refinance their credit card debt using a P2P loan. These loans are not secured by any property, like a house or car. The lender (investor) is essentially trusting that the borrower will pay the loan back. Investors in P2P loans typically invest in hundreds of loans, buying a small piece of each loan. (See article: Can't Get A Bank Loan? Turn To Your Neighbor.)\n\nWhy are interest rates and investor returns different?\n\nP2P loans usually carry interest rates that are around 2% lower than what the borrower would pay on a credit card. Interest rates on P2P loans typically range from 6% to 30% depending on the credit risk of the borrower. However, it’s very important to understand that the interest rate the borrower pays is not the same as the investor’s returns. There are servicing fees which reduce returns. However, the biggest reason that the returns on these loans are much lower than their interest rates is borrower default. A large number of people who take these loans do not end up paying them back in full. (For related reading, see: FYI on ROI: A Guide To Calculating Return On Investment.)\n\nWhat can an investor expect to earn from an investment in P2P loans?\n\nThe table below shows the investor returns, including both fees and defaults, for P2P loans based on the years in which the loans were made from the two largest P2P companies, Lending Club and Prosper. The figures for the latter years are not yet “final,” as most of these loans are still being paid off, and a possibility remains for the borrower to default. On the other hand, the return numbers for 2010, 2011, 2012 should not be changing significantly. For loans issued during those time periods, annual investor returns have ranged from 6.1% to 10.8%. If history is a guide to the future, it would be reasonable to expect a return of 7% or 8%.\n\nReturn On Investment for P2P Loans\n\nYear Lending Club Prosper 2014 10.5% 9.9% 2013 8.8% 9.9% 2012 6.7% 7.6% 2011 6.3% 9.3% 2010 6.1% 10.8%\n\nData from Nickel Steamroller\n\nWhy history may not be a guide for the future\n\nOver the last few years, the economy has been improving. The unemployment rate has been coming down. It doesn’t take a genius to know that a person with a job is more likely to pay back a loan than a person without a job. If the unemployment rate were to increase and a significant number of borrowers lost their jobs, a reasonable person would expect that loan defaults would increase. More defaults equal lower returns. (To understand how the unemployment rate is determined, see article: The Unemployment Rate: Get Real.)\n\nWhat would I tell my friends and mother about investing in P2P loans?\n\nI personally invest in P2P loans because I think that I will earn about 8%. In fact, I have been earning more than 8% during the last 3 years that I have been investing in P2P loans. I have recommended investing in P2P loans to my friends, and at least one of them has followed my lead. However, I have not yet recommended them to my mother. I know that she would be uncomfortable with potential swings in returns and would be more comfortable investing in stable government-insured investments like savings bonds.

01/19/2015,"['\'Big four\' auditing firm KPMG has published a report identifying bitcoin as both a threat and an opportunity to the banking sector.\n\nThe report, titled The Changing World of Money, outlines the factors threatening established retail banks, whilst discussing the potential of cryptocurrencies as viable payment solutions.\n\nIt states:\n\n""New challenger organisations, from banks to peer-to-peer lenders to PayPal and bitcoin are smaller, more agile and quicker to respond to changing trends.""\n\nThe document goes on to explain that these emerging forms of payments have ""greater responsiveness to customer needs"", attracting ""affluent, intelligent and profitable customers"".\n\nThe issue, KPMG says, is that banks are unable to respond to their customer\'s needs quickly. ""Their legacy systems, data management, increased costs of regulatory controls and the increasing focus on remediation"" hamper their response speed, it explains.\n\nBy considering the three fundamentals of retail banking – lending, deposits and payments – and identifying some of the threats, challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in each case, the report makes a series of tough points for bank leaders regarding the sort of organisations that will thrive in the short and long run.\n\nThe biggest issue raised, arguably, is whether the growth of electronic payments, cryptocurrencies and local trading exchanges will eventually eradicate traditional money.\n\n\'Giant ledger in the cloud\'\n\nHaving recognised the potential of cryptocurrencies, the paper encourages economists, policymakers and businesses to start thinking differently about money, whilst highlighting the shortcomings of bitcoin.\n\n""[Cryptocurrencies] need to operate as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account"", the report states before adding that:\n\n""As a medium of exchange bitcoin is constrained by the fact that so few outlets accept it in payment. It is not yet a reliable store of value because its price against national currencies can fluctuate as much as 20% a day.""\n\nDescribing bitcoin as a ""giant public ledger in the cloud,"" Jon Matonis, former founding director at the Bitcoin Foundation, is cited claiming that there is no reason why the major banks could not tap into the increasing demand for peer-to-peer cryptocurrency.\n\nBanks could look into operating bitcoin retail transactions and setting up the required systems of escrow, he is quoted as saying.\n\nPayments in a heartbeat\n\nThe fact that the future of payment is likely to include all kinds of clever new technologies, many of which are still in the very early stages of development, does not come as news to many.\n\nAs an example, the KPMG report describes a recent offering from Canadian firm Bionym, which has developed what it describes as \'the world\'s first biometrically authenticated wearable payment solution\'.\n\nThat solution, the Nymi, is a wristband that reads the wearer\'s unique individual cardiac rhythm, which are unique to each individual. Once authenticated, the device can largely be used with existing contactless payment systems.\n\nBank speculates on cryptocurrencies\n\nThe publication of the report comes after KPMG issued an ISAE 3402 accreditation – a global standard for financial reporting – to digital currency storage device Elliptic, earlier this month.\n\nThe Bank of England\'s Quarterly Bulletin 2014 report, titled The Economics of Digital Currencies, also speculated about the emergence of a banking system based on a digital currency.\n\nThe report said:\n\n""An important question that would then emerge is whether banks could be constrained in their creation of broad money without regulatory oversight or central bank involvement in the management of the underlying base currency.""\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, that not’s really the case, according to one bitcoin expert.\n\nThough it quickly became outdated thanks to bitcoin rebounding (on Friday morning it was back up to trading at roughly $210), a quote from a The Wall Street Journal article last week highlighted the volatility of bitcoin’s price in recent months.\n\n“The virtual currency, which trades mostly in unregulated overseas markets, has fallen 44 percent since the start of the year and 85 percent from the record high of $1,165 it hit in early December 2013. In total, almost $11.3 billion in value has been lost since that peak.”\n\nThe rise and fall (and subsequent fluctuations) in price of the digital currency doesn’t have bitcoin experts worried, however. Poker pro Bryan Micon, who is the affiliate manager for the leading bitcoin-only online poker site Seals with Clubs (one of many online gaming sites to utilize the technology), is one of those who isn’t concerned, especially by pessimistic headlines.\n\n“I would characterize the recent downward (then slightly upward) bitcoin price movement the same way I always characterize them: We are once again observing a small, unregulated market which is completely driven by human supply-demand,” Micon said.\n\n“If more bitcoin holders want to sell than fiat holders want to buy, the price will go down. When the opposite is true the price will go up,” he added.\n\nA recent article from Wired, titled “The Price of Bitcoin Doesn’t Matter Right Now”, made an interesting comparison between bitcoin and the early stages of the Internet itself. It took years before the internet matured into what it is today. Bitcoin might take awhile to gain that permanence and widespread economic confidence, so a falling price definitely doesn’t mean doom and gloom.\n\nLas Vegas, the gambling capital of the world, saw its first bitcoin ATM just last year.\n\nMicon added that fiat currency is obviously still what people value bitcoin against, but that those who have faith in the digital currency aren’t dismayed by downward price movements.\n\n“I feel the world will continue to embrace bitcoin over time, and as always, I’m going to continue to hold,” said Micon, who has been involved with bitcoin since 2011.\n\nMicon thinks it’s pretty crazy these days to witness “bitcoin derivatives possibly moving the market with such force” given how young the digital currency really is. It was first conceived of in 2008 by developer Satoshi Nakamoto, making it only about six years old.\n\nAs for how the price of bitcoin affects online gaming sites that use it, Micon said:\n\n“It’s been my observation that bitcoin poker players tend to play less when the price goes down. I think from a bitcoin enthusiast standpoint there is less to be excited about as the price slides. The flip side of that coin is that when the price spikes upward humans seem to be more excited about bitcoin in general, and play seems to pick up.”\n\nAccording to tracking from PokerScout, traffic on Seals With Clubs has remained pretty consistent over the past six months. Same with Switch Poker, another bitcoin poker site.', 'GUELPH — Rumours of the impending demise of the Bitcoin digital money system are nonsense, a local proponent of the innovation contends.\n\n""It\'s alive and well,"" said Zach Ramsay, a partner with fellow entrepreneur Ethan Buchman in Guelph\'s Coin Culture, which last May launched its first automated teller machine at Global Currency Services on Gordon Street South.\n\nRamsay said he\'s looking to place another such unit in Guelph and would like it to be located downtown.\n\nGlobal Currency Services founder and owner Carinta Mannarelli said the ATM at her shop appears busy and Coin Culture holds public information sessions there periodically.\n\n""It\'s in my lobby. There\'s quite a few people coming in and using it,"" she said, noting she provides the space for free because she views Bitcoin as complementary to her physical money exchange business.\n\nThe feedback on Bitcoin from users has been positive, she added.\n\nBitcoin, a decentralized virtual currency invented in 2008 and trading through open-source software on peer-to-peer computer systems in unregulated markets, hasn\'t been without its growing pains here and abroad. These include a plunge in value from about $1,200 Canadian per Bitcoin last year to well under $300 today.\n\nBut Ramsay said some media and public have misunderstood that drop, which astute Bitcoin followers see as a buying opportunity as the cost of the cryptocurrency falls.\n\nSo it isn\'t getting closer to demise. ""The economic intent is to keep it going,"" he said, noting that when the price drops ""we see an increase in volume."" When it\'s challenged by circumstances, such as a computer hacking scandal abroad, it gets stronger and more robust, he added.\n\n""People see it as a buying opportunity.""', 'While in Amsterdam during my vacation in Holland, I did not miss the opportunity to visit almost every local Bitcoin-friendly business participating in the Bitstraat program in the city.\n\nUnfortunately, I was underwhelmed—not by the number of participants, which currently totals one or two dozen, but by the problems I encountered when trying to pay for my purchases with bitcoin.\n\nFirst, the staff at many places, including the cafe that hosts the Bitcoin embassy itself, were not on-boarded when it comes to using the POS terminals. Understandably, personnel frequently changes and many new staff members have never even heard of digital currency, let alone knowing how to operate the tablets given out to merchants (the first 100 were free) by BitPay as part of the program. One time, I even had to demonstrate, to their amazement, just how easy it was (for me at least) to bring up the QR-code via Bitkassa’s interface.\n\nSecond, the infrastructure still is not where it should be. For example, the two-way Bitcoin ATM at Cafe Kobalt only worked once out of the four times I visited. Initially, the touch screen was nonresponsive and a day later, after it was fixed, the machine ran out of cash immediately after my first successful attempt, and charged 5% commission at that. Additionally, the android POS tablets were ostensibly of inferior quality and did not work on two occasions and two different locations, forcing me to pay with cash. Thus, the technology itself, while copacetic perhaps for the tech-savvy user when operational, it is nowhere ready for the mainstream.\n\n—The problematic 2-way BTM at Cafe Kobalt (left); 1-way BTM at the Bitcoin Embassy (right)\n\nAnd finally, one business told me that they did not accept bitcoin anymore, even though they were listed on the Bitstraat map, while a couple of others had to verify whether it was possible, giving me a positive answer only after I told them that they will only get my business if they accepted my bitcoins.\n\nI was not entirely surprised, and I even understood, since the technology is still in its infancy. Moreover, developed countries like the Netherlands have an efficient system where debit cards work well for nearly everyone, and most of the population is ‘banked’ and holds their own bank accounts. You don’t hear many people complaining about the difficulty of using debit cards in Holland (though some merchants that I talked to do agree that the credit card fees are a serious disadvantage by comparison).\n\nAn additional payment option using some “obscure virtual money” is probably not a pressing need for the average person unless they know the ins-and-outs of the world’s financial system, how money is created, and they understand the true value of Bitcoin with a capital ‘B,’ like Amsterdam Bitcoin Embassy founder and ambassador, Marek Skonieczny.\n\n—Bitcoin POS terminals at Mensocks (left) and Hofje van Wijs Cafe (right)\n\nBitcoin and the ‘ Other 6 Billion ’\n\nMany people forget that besides the advantage of being an alternative to the sputtering global financial system, the real potential for the technology may lie beyond the First World. Marek also operates a website called bitcoinclix.com, which introduces people to the cryptocurrency and rewards users in Bitcoin for clicking on ads and links online.\n\nLast year in April, he received an email that stated:\n\n“Hello sir, I clicked all the ads on your website, can you pay me my bitcoin, I want to buy a sandwich.”\n\nThe user with an IP address from India apparently registered the same day, clicked the ads and was set to receive about 25,000 satoshis. Not giving it much thought, Marek sent the unknown user the promised reward, after which he received three similar emails the next morning from the same IP address.\n\nThen, after repeating the process, he received 120 more emails within three weeks. Looking further into the matter, Marek found out via the IP that the emails came from a school in India. He called and got in contact with the English teacher who recognized him when he mentioned the word Bitcoin. “You are the Bitcoin man! Mr. Bitcoin!” she said in excitement.\n\nThe mysterious users were actually students from a school in Bangalore who were earning virtual currency to buy food: hamburgers for US$0.12 cents each (calculated from the price in rupees) and sandwiches (for US$0.06-7 cents each). “So practically he would be able to buy a hamburger and two sandwiches for these 25,000 satoshis,” explained Marek.\n\nAfter Marek enquired further, the teacher explained that “it was very good” and that he “shouldn’t stop,” adding:\n\n“They are kids, they’re about 9 years old and for the first five weeks they were only buying hamburgers. But now they have a secret project.”\n\nApparently, the kids in India needed just one day to figure out how to use the website and then change bitcoins into their local currency. “You have to realize what you are doing,” she explained. “You are sending them 25 cents, while their parents work in a factory and they make one dollar per day.”\n\nThese parents would normally never give their kids a quarter of their meager daily wage for a sandwich. “And then in fifteen minutes, this kid could make one quarter of what his father is earning,” exclaimed Marek, “and this is opening up new opportunities so that is the most exciting part for me.”\n\nListening to Marek’s story, I became even more certain that the greatest potential for Bitcoin lies in what it can do for developing nations such as India, where the majority of the population has no access to banking services and survives on a dollar per day. Bitcoin, much like the Internet, is border-agnostic. It has the potential to incorporate “the other 6 billion,” as Andreas Antonopoulos put it in one of his speeches, into the global economy, opening a vast number of economic opportunities.\n\nConclusion\n\nSurrounded by the noise and rumblings of naysayers, speculators and opportunists, the progression of Bitcoin, much like any other innovation, will certainly take time. And amid the endless scandals and debates about the cryptocurrency’s inherent value, price and other “First World problems,” many still choose to ignore its more important application as “the great equalizer” for the rest of the developing world.\n\nMarek added that his next goal is to design a website that will send money abroad directly. He explained:\n\n“If you think about it, it’s incredible. […] I made 3,000 transactions at 25 cents a piece to India and I spent in total 50 dollars [for transfer fees]. And with this, 120 kids could have a normal life for just 50 dollars and I don’t need to [have] any kind of organization in between. It was not possible before. This is what I think is the most beautiful part of Bitcoin.”\n\n“How many Leonardo Da Vincis will be born now because they weren’t discovered before or didn’t have the chance to be discovered?” he added. “Before, they had to work in a factory to support the family, where now they have a choice.”\n\nBitcoin is understandably progressing slowly as a currency. It is still limited to a few enthusiasts in developed countries like the Netherlands. Meanwhile, people in other nations, especially the younger tech-inclined populations, are starting to recognize and use the technology as a tool to not only solve real problems and improve their own lives, but also to plant the seeds for a truly interconnected and more inclusive global economy.\n\nUpdate (20.01.2014):\n\nIn place of the bitcoinclix.com website mentioned in the article above, kids will have the chance to collect 25,000 satoshi for every 15 minutes they learn about cryptocurrencies on the online resource www.bitsforkids.academy (currently under development). Marek has confirmed that it will be his next project after the Bitcoin Embassy in Amsterdam. In addition, he has registered the domain www.satoshischool.com, which will be the main organization that will develop various types of learning projects for children. In the meantime, you can support his projects at his website www.bitcoinaid.org where you can earn or donate bitcoins.\n\n—Marek Skonieczny\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

We see bitcoin as a way to facilitate that.”\n\nHow the product works\n\nBitwage’s international payroll solution accepts and pays out in fiat currency, but uses bitcoin in the middle to transfer the value from one place to another.\n\nSince Bitwage already has a bitcoin payroll system in the US, it was easily able to integrate with Coins.ph; sending them bitcoin to be paid out at the other end.\n\nCoins.ph customers can choose to collect Philippine pesos or preloaded cash cards, or receive their payments via bank transfers. Even door-to-door delivery of cash is possible.\n\nChester said:\n\n""Bitcoin is the best way to get cross-border payments into the hands of both banked and underbanked people.""\n\nBitwage acts as a invisible middle entity in payroll transactions. Employers usually ask an employee for bank transfer information when they first start working for the company.\n\n""They’re just routing the [transaction] to Bitwage as opposed to routing the credit to a bank account,"" explained Chester.\n\nThe Philippines market\n\nThere are a number of players looking to bring bitcoin to the Philippines market, which is largely a cash-based society with a large number of ex-pat workers that remit money home.\n\nCompanies like Coins.ph, 37Coins and Boost VC-backed Palarin are all seeking to gain a foothold in this Southeast Asian market.\n\nCheap labor costs and often good standards of English also mean there are a number of employers in the US that employ Philippine developers, transcriptionists and general office assistants remotely.\n\nHowever, it’s not easy to send money to the Philippines, as funds can take many days to arrive and transaction fees are often high. An additional hurdle is the high number of unbanked in the country.\n\nBitwage is hoping to disrupt that scenario by utilising bitcoin\'s faster transaction speed and relatively low fees in combination with Coins.ph\'s exchange service at the Asian end.\n\nBitwage is currently part of Plug and Play’s bitcoin accelerator program in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nGlobe image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

One of the main problems with Bitcoin is the point-of-sale systems used by retailers rely on an Internet connection. If this connection is unstable, Bitcoin transactions can take ages to process, or fail to go through at all.\n\nJan Vornberger, a developer for cryptocurrency wallet Hive, has now created Bitcoin Box to address this problem. Bitcoin Box is a point-of-sale system for cryptocurrencies that can process transactions offline. Instead of relying on an Internet connection for transactions to go through, it utilizes Near-Field Communications (NFC) and Bluetooth technologies for faster transactions.\n\n“So far, most bitcoin POS solutions rely on simply having the customer broadcast the bitcoin transaction over the bitcoin network. This can be unreliable, as sometimes the shop system does not see the transaction immediately, resulting in delays,” Vornberger stated.\n\nVornberger said Bitcoin Box was inspired by Apple Pay and uses the BIP70 bitcoin payment protocol to directly transmit cryptocurrency from the user’s wallet to a merchant’s server. Bitcoin Box is said to be compatible with all existing wallets and seamlessly upgrades to the updated BIP70 mechanism. The hardware uses off the shelf components and a Raspberry Pi board, and will be priced at $299 once it becomes available in three to six months time.\n\nHere’s a video showing the Bitcoin Box in action:\n\nMost Bitcoin POS are software-only, thus Vornberger sees his product as something that could help to make Bitcoin faster and easier to use, and hopefully accelerate its adoption.\n\nImage credit: Bitcoin Box via Coindesk.com', 'In 2010, more than $5 billion was sent back home from Indonesian migrant workers across the world, up 2.44 percent from 2009 ($4.91 billion). That number may seem huge but, in the grand scheme of things, it’s very small. Through the process of remittance, $436 billion looked to be sent back home in total during 2014 – before the banks took their cut through fees.\n\nAccording to a report by the World Bank, in 2013 the global average cost of sending remittances was 8.58 percent – a decline from the previous year but a large cut nonetheless. If a similar average fee remained in 2010, as a similar report suggests, that means that of the $5 billion Indonesian migrant workers were sending back home, the banks were getting their cut of $429 million.\n\nBut with bitcoin remittance services coming out of the woodwork recently, that cut could be taken down significantly. If they all only took a one percent cut of the bitcoin remittance, remittance services can make sure more than $374 million, that were once lost, can now go straight to the people that deserve it.\n\nBitspark Expanding Bitcoin Remittance Services to Indonesia\n\nLooking at this data, one can see there’s a desperate need for people to be able to send money back home through bitcoin. In fact, that’s just what Bitspark saw and decided to react. According to an announcement, Bitspark will be expanding their bitcoin remittance service from Hong Kong to Indonesia in the coming months.\n\nAlso Read: Coinapult Bitcoin SMS Wallet Allows the World to Send Remittances with Just a Text\n\n“We are excited to be able to bring our low cost service to Indonesia in partnership with PT Artabit,” said the Bitspark CEO George Harrap.\n\n“Indonesia is an exciting opportunity and a key focus for us, it’s a very different market in terms of logistics and distribution than our existing Philippines services with many people using Post Offices as the primary cash pickup location, not third party remittance stores.”\n\nThrough Bitspark, Indonesian migrant workers can send their earnings in bitcoin to their families back home with little prior knowledge of the technology. When their family is notified, they can then pick up their cash in the national currency equal to the market value at the time of transfer.\n\n“We are the cheapest option to send money to Indonesia and while other remittance services may support either bank pickup or post office pickups, we can do both, quicker and cheaper than the competition. It’s a win\xad-win for the customer.”\n\nThe best part? There’s no need for the person receiving the sent money to know anything about bitcoin – at all. They never need to know it was sent with bitcoin, and they can have more money on average than before.\n\nAccording to their research, more than 170,000 Indonesian migrant workers are employed in Hong Kong. While Hong Kong doesn’t bring in nearly as much as the worldwide remittance total, the practice of using bitcoin as a tool for remittance is something that could save a lot of people quite a bit of money annually.\n\nMost of the Indonesian migrant workers work in Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Taiwan. If bitcoin remittance took off in all of those places, money would go back in the pockets of those who earned it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Digital Currency Council (DCC) has made quite a name for itself in 2014, charting the adoption of Bitcoin throughout Western Civilization. The DCC also provides testing for Bitcoin practitioners, and a place for accountants, lawyers and other legal professionals to get the latest training and accreditation in Bitcoin in order to educate the populace.\n\nNow they are adding a Bitcoin rating system to Bitcoin’s international social strata for 2015 with the Top 30 Bitcoin Influencers in Social Media.\n\nDCC’s Top 30 Bitcoin Influencers Thru 2014\n\nBitcoin adoption continued to grow in 2014, with near 1000 new merchants joining the Bitcoin ecosystem weekly. The number of transactions conducted daily reached an all time high. And venture capital investment reached over $300 million. Yet the majority of the world is still not familiar with Bitcoin, let alone utilizing and enjoying the benefits of it.\n\nThe 30 most influential people in Bitcoin on social media are leading the charge in changing this fact. The Digital Currnecy Council has compiled a list of the most influential Bitcoiners on social media. The top 30 were then identified using measures like the amount of Twitter followers, their Klout Score, and their social Peer Index. These data points reflect a variety of factors including social footprint, engagement frequency, amplification, and citations by influential writers along with other related items. Each factor was then given a rating to derive a final data driven list of the 30 most influential Bitcoiners on social media though the end of 2014.\n\nI spoke with Digital Currency Council CEO David Berger about the study, and what he hopes to accomplish with it.\n\n“Our study was driven by the data – Twitter followers, Klout Scores, and Peer Indexes – and yielded some obvious and some surprising results. The Bitcoin community is going through a maturation process, which many of these influencers have been driving. And it will further mature, as more articulate leaders emerge, over time, and grow their social media followers and influence. Sharing the facts (about Bitcoin) in a clear, insightful, and engaging manner is the best way to build (social) influence.”\n\nAlso Read: Survey Reports British Residents Aware of Bitcoin, but Not Embracing It Yet\n\nThere is one important thing to understand also when evaluating this list of Bitcoin social influencers. This does not factor in major Bitcoin community communication avenues, such as BitcoinTalk, ZapChain, or Reddit. This study was used by DCC to focus specifically on metrics measuring influence outside the Bitcoin community. The goal is to find those movers and shakers who are helping to grow the Bitcoin brand towards the broader mainstream, not preaching to the converted.\n\nThose listed provide consistent, clear, and factual communication to individuals who are not yet familiar with the technology. Here you will find leading investors, entrepreneurs, cryptographers, journalists, and other professionals. These individuals exert significant influence within the Bitcoin community as well, but are now being recognized for their influence on social media outside the community, leading to increased adoption in the mainstream. They spend considerable time educating people outside of the Bitcoin community, and are consistently looking to expand Bitcoin’s sphere of influence.\n\nHere is the list effective of the Top 30 Bitcoin Influencers, effective January 1st, 2015:\n\nImages supplied by DCC.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Australian bitcoin company Digital CC Limited, which trades as 'digitalBTC', experienced a big selloff on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) last Friday.\n\nThe sudden and drastic increase in trading volume prompted the ASX to send a formal notice to the firm the very same day, asking whether or not there was any undisclosed information that could have prompted the selloff.\n\nThe firm started trading on the ASX following a reverse takeover of Digital CC Limited last year.\n\nFollowing the bitcoin price crash on 14th January,digitalBTC's trading volume spiked from under 10,000–48,000 shares per day to 416,125 shares last Friday.\n\nCompany blames bitcoin slump for spike in volume\n\nIn response to the ASX notice, Digital CC secretary Rachel Jelleff said the company was not aware of any information which would explain the recent trading spike, as all relevant information was disclosed to the market already.\n\nJelleff went on to explain that the low price of bitcoin was the most likely culprit behind the selloff:\n\n“In recent days the bitcoin price has hit a 12 month low of $173, from a price of over $800 in January 2014. The current bitcoin price impacts the profitability of the company’s ongoing bitcoin mining activities and the value of its bitcoin inventory, which is what the company believes is the reason for the recent price movement.”\n\nJelleff said Digital CC Limited is continuing development of consumer applications and is seeking to fast track the launch of these products in the coming months to become a “vertically integrated payment technology company”.\n\n“These new consumer bitcoin applications will be the focus of the company’s resources and a key driver of its future growth and value,” said Jelleff.\n\nDigital CC stock takes a beating\n\nShortly after it was listed on the ASX, the company’s share price passed AU$0.30 and six months ago it was relatively stable in the AU$0.32–AU$0.34 range.\n\nHowever, as the price of bitcoin went down in the second half of 2014, so did Digital CC’s share price and by mid-October it had dropped below the AU$0.20 mark.\n\nThe share price was holding steady near the AU$0.15 mark for several weeks leading up to the selloff, but on 16th January it dropped to a new low. The share price currently stands at AU$0.091. The company has 84.41m outstanding shares and at press time the market capitalisation was AU$7.68m.\n\nJelleff said the company “has been very fortunate” to be at the forefront of bitcoin mining, which generated nearly $10m in revenue over the last nine months, describing the result as exceptional for a tech startup.\n\n“To maintain profitable operating margins in its mining activities given the recent decrease in the price of bitcoin, the company has been renegotiating power and other operating costs to maintain competitiveness in a lower bitcoin price environment which currently exists,” she said.\n\nStaying competitive in the current climate\n\nDigital CC started exploring alternative energy sources several months ago and, in August 2014, entered a multi-year hosting and power supply contract with an Icelandic company.\n\nThe company released its Q3 earnings report in October 2014, In the Q3 report, the company reported an operating loss of $261,000, but also confirmed that it had a substantial bitcoin cache of approximately 8,800 BTC. The Q4 2014 report is due to be published soon.\n\nSince it is currently the only bitcoin mining company listed on a major stock exchange, digital CC offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of mining operations through its regulatory filings.\n\nPrivately owned mining operations tend to be secretive and, with no reporting requirements, such information is usually hard to come by.\n\nShare price image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Click the video below to listen. (If you missed the first two parts of this series, go here for Part I, or click here to listen to Part II.)\n\nRobert Williams\n\nFounder, Wall Street Daily\n\nTranscript:\n\nRobert Williams: Hi there. Robert Williams here, the Publisher of Wall Street Daily. I have bestselling author Peter Schiff with me today. Peter predicted the implosion of the housing market and stock market in his book, Crash Proof, but warns in his latest book, The Real Crash, that an even bigger crisis is on our front doorstep. In our first two parts of our interview, Peter described how the United States is already bankrupt and that policymakers would be well advised to take the pain of a bankruptcy now in a controlled fashion rather than risk chaos in a crash later. Now today, Peter, let’s discuss where to invest in 2015, which seems like a real challenge considering how sick the world is. Are there any safe havens left anymore?\n\nPeter Schiff: Yeah. Well, again, from the short run, there’s no necessarily safe havens where you can put your money there and, you know, when you go to look at your account, that it’s not gonna go down because, you know, ’cause I think the safe havens are outside the U.S., which means you’re subjected – you know, vulnerable to a rally in the dollar. So the dollar goes up and, you know, your investment’s gonna go down if it’s in one of these safe haven countries. But I think you just have to understand the big picture and be – you know, be confident that you’re right and just have the courage in your convictions and ride it out.\n\nRobert Williams: How about commodities at these beaten-down levels, Peter? Do they have appeal?\n\nPeter Schiff: Yeah, definitely. I guess I think that, when the Fed is forced into QE4, that’s gonna be a big benefit for commodities, ’cause right now commodities are factoring in and tied with the Fed. Higher interest rates, a stronger dollar. When they don’t get that, when they get the opposite of that, you know, more QE and a weaker dollar, commodity prices are gonna rise sharply.\n\nRobert Williams: Let’s talk about Bitcoin for a moment, Peter. I know you’ve been a vocal skeptic of the cryptocurrency. Do you still have your doubts or is it time to look at Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value?\n\nPeter Schiff: No. I mean, I don’t really think there’s any value to store in Bitcoin, so that is its inherent flaw and, you know, so far this year my warnings on Bitcoin, you know, have proved prescient so far because Bitcoin has dropped on the year. You know, it’s down better than 50% since the beginning of the year, and we’re not even getting any kind of a big bounce. I think the fact that Bitcoin is not benefiting at all from the weakness in the ruble – let’s remember a year ago how much Bitcoin benefited from the problems in Cyprus and Cyprians, you know, buying Bitcoin to kind of protect themselves from what was going on in their banks and, you know, Russia’s certainly a much bigger economy than Cyprus, and where are all the Russians, you know, buying Bitcoin, right, to protect themselves against the drop in the ruble?\n\nSo I don’t think it’s – you know, I think this shows that the appeal of Bitcoin is already wearing and people are not seeing it as a store of value or safe haven. And so I think there’s still a lot of downside left in digital currency. In fact, all digital currencies, not just Bitcoin. In fact, I think there’s a lot of risk between now and the end of the year. We’ll see [a lot of risk] because one thing that they’ve never had in Bitcoin is tax loss selling. And I don’t know how much they might have had this year but, you know, the IRS was kinda unclear about the tax rules before, although everybody had gains in Bitcoin up until this year ’cause it had only gone up. But now, you know, a vast majority of people who own Bitcoins have losses and, you know, they might want those losses. They might want to use them, so it could be, you know, some selling coming in the Bitcoin market here in the next couple of weeks as people – you know, you have to sell them before the end of the year to use the loss this year. And the market has never had to deal with that before, you know, so, but, you know, if you get a lot of selling into that market, you know, what could that do to the price? I mean, I think if we crash below 300, I mean, who knows. We could end up – we could go sub-200, you know, so we’ll see.\n\nRobert Williams: Peter, I’m receiving a lot of messages from our readers about oil at these levels. There’s some belief that we’re seeing a historic buying opportunity. Should my readers be excited or is this still a “buyer beware” market?\n\nPeter Schiff: Well, you know, I don’t know for sure. I mean, if I did, you know, I suppose I could make a lot of money if I knew for sure, but I would agree with your readers in that, you know, I don’t think oil can sustain itself at these levels, so can oil go to $40 or $30 a barrel? Sure. But can it stay there for an extended period of time? No. There’s not enough production that’s economical at those levels because, you know, the cost of producing oil has gone up a lot over the past 10 years, and so, you know, most companies aren’t even close to being productive at those prices. So what would happen is you would have massive capacity coming out of the oil market. Drilling would, you know, and exploration would go away, drilling would go way down, and so the supply of oil would plunge, and so that would make the price go back up so, you know, that’s one.\n\nAnd number two, is, I think the weakness in the oil price is also a precursor to global recession. I mean, oil prices collapsed in 2008 from $150 a barrel to $32 a barrel, something like that. So that was an even bigger collapse than this, and that was basically the beginning of the Great Recession. And so I think what’s happening in the oil market is also a function of global economies weakening, including the U.S. economy. I think all this optimism about the U.S. economy is unwarranted, and I think that one of the reasons that oil prices are coming down is also because the U.S. economy is gonna be slowing down, and I think it’s also because the Fed is removing the monetary combination, and I think that is not just gonna affect oil, but it’s gonna affect stocks, it’s gonna affect real estate, and so if falling oil prices are basically a harbinger of a recession, and if they’re coming down because of the general weakness in asset markets, then what is the Fed going to do?\n\nThe Fed is going to print more money. The Fed is going to call off the rate hikes, it’s going to come back with another round of quantitative easing, and that will be extremely bullish for oil prices, just like it was bullish for oil prices in 2009. And so the question is: Where is the bottom? You know, how low will it go before it turns around and then how high will it go after it does? But yeah, I’m certain that oil prices are gonna be much, much higher than $55 a barrel a year from now. I just don’t know how much lower they’re gonna go in the short run. You know, they could get a lot lower. You know, I don’t know. The market’s dropping like a stone here.\n\nRobert Williams: And, Peter, we can’t even trust gold in this environment. I mean, in this – in the face of this coming crisis and all the debt in the system, you would think that gold would be marching higher, but it isn’t. Is that going to continue into 2015 or could we see a reversal in gold?\n\nPeter Schiff: Gold should be going up, and it would be going up if more people understood the problems, but I think there still is a lot of speculators that are shorting gold and are so convinced that it’s gonna go down, but ultimately when they’re overwhelmed, the rally in gold is gonna be enormous, and the losses for speculators who are shorting it are gonna be even more enormous. So right now you’ve got people piling short gold, but this is gonna be a devastating trade for them, you know, once the tide turns, and it could happen [to be] a spectacular 2015 based on, you know, these forces reversing and the speculators having to throw in the towel.\n\nRobert Williams: Well, Peter, thanks again for your time. We’ll be sure to circle back with you in the second quarter of 2015. Oh, and if any of our readers missed the first two parts of our interview where we talk about the coming crash, well, we’ve archived those interviews on the website. For Wall Street Daily, I’m Robert Williams.\n\n[End of Audio]']"
01/20/2015,"['The trial of the alleged mastermind behind the world\'s biggest online drugs marketplace began last week, and the case could have significant implications for online anonymity and the regulation of digital currency.\n\nRoss Ulbricht, the alleged founder of Silk Road, has been charged with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking, and money laundering.\n\nUlbricht\'s lawyers tried to get out of money laundering charges last year by claiming that Bitcoin, the digital currency used to purchase goods on Silk Road, is not real money. The judge didn\'t buy it , however, ruling that "" Bitcoins carry value — that is their purpose and function — and act as a medium of exchange.""\n\nThis decision to equate bitcoins with real currency could subject the digital cash to a whole host of new laws. The prosecution showed last week that Silk Road vendors could sell their bitcoins directly on the site for real money and t his, according to the government, amounts to money laundering in the most basic sense: liquidating proceeds from illicit transactions to mask the source of the funds.\n\nProsecutors allege that Silk Road generated an estimated $1.2 billion in revenue between 2011 and 2013, including an estimated $80 million paid in commissions.\n\nWhile Ulbricht\'s supporters have challenged the idea that virtual currency — and, by extension, the dark net — can be regulated as such, others argue that the government\'s powers do not end at the internet.\n\n""Taking things out of the Bitcoin arena, you\'re not allowed to have a flea market where you\'re dealing drugs,"" corporate attorney Marcus Asner told Business Insider. ""If you buy into the notion that the government gets to regulate narcotics, then the fact that it [regulation] is done online makes no difference.""\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan admitted last week in a testimony that at one point he was convinced that Mark Karpeles, the owner and operator of the world’s largest (and now-bankrupt) Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, was running Silk Road to drive up the value of bitcoins, the New York Times reported. Karpeles has denied any involvement.\n\nBitcoin may have begun as a libertarian project, but it has gained widespread appeal among those who value its relative anonymity and lack of regulation. With more mainstream appeal, however, has come more government oversight: Mt. Gox accounts in the US holding nearly $10 million worth of bitcoins were seized in 2013, and law enforcement officials now have tools to investigate the criminal organizations that try to use the currency for illegal purposes.\n\nAsner, former chief of the Major Crimes Unit in the US Attorney\'s office in Manhattan, believes the Bitcoin industry not only supports reasonable and effective regulation, but that total anonymity was never its strength in the first place.\n\n""If you wanted to transfer money secretly, Bitcoin would be a bad way to do it,"" Asner said.\n\nThis is because law enforcement officials can easily trace the IP addresses of buyers and sellers by accessing the transaction\'s online ""blockchain."" Bitcoin is anonymous, but it is not untraceable.\n\nPeople are still innocent until proven guilty, however, which is why a matching IP address is usually not enough for a conviction. Just as an incriminating phone call can only be traced back to the phone and not the individual who placed the call, an incriminating IP address can only trace back to a computer and not its user at the time the transaction occurred.\n\nThis burden of proof is currently on the prosecution at the Silk Road trial, as it always is in criminal cases. While the government has claimed to have traced Dread Pirate Roberts\' — the marketplace\'s operator — back to Ulbricht\'s IP address, Ulbricht\'s defense team has challenged them to prove that Ulbricht was actually running the site from the time it was launched in February 2011 until it was shut down in late 2013.\n\nIn opening statements, the defense claimed that Ulbricht had created Silk Road as an ""economic experiment,"" but later handed it off to someone else once it became too chaotic. This ""someone else,"" the real Dread Pirate Roberts, is still out there, Ulbricht\'s lawyers argue. The defense says its client was just a ""fall guy.""\n\nUlbricht, a 30-year-old Texas native and former Eagle Scout, studied physics as a grad student at Pennsylvania State University. Soon after he graduated, Ulbricht became a passionate Libertarian, writing in his LinkedIn profile that ""the most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments.""\n\nIn Austin, he was also the CEO of Good Wagon Books , a nonprofit that donated used books to prisons, we have previously reported.\n\n\n\nHe moved to San Francisco after grad school under the name ""Joshua Terrey,"" claiming to be a freelance currency trader, and was arrested at Glen Park Branch Library in San Francisco in October 2013. Prosecutors claim he was caught red-handed, ""literally with his fingers at the keyboard, running the Silk Road"" when agents surrounded him.', 'Coinbase has raised $75 million in Series C funding, in what is believed to be the largest-ever funding round for a Bitcoin-related company.\n\nDFJ Growth led the round, and was joined by The New York Stock Exchange, USAA, BBVA (Spain), NTT Docomo (Japan), Valor Capital Group, Vikram Pandit, Tom Glocer and Carlos Rodriguez Pastor. Returning investors included Andreessen Horowitz, Reddit Capital and Union Square Ventures. No word on valuation, although an earlier Re/Code report suggested that the deal would value Coinbase at around $400 million.\n\n“Our original goal at the beginning of October was basically to raise around $50 million at a reasonable valuation,” says Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, who declined to elaborate on ‘reasonable.’\n\nEhrsam adds that earlier rumors of a $100 million target at a significantly higher valuation were unfounded: “I don’t entirely know where all of that came from, except that people in the Bitcoin community try to over-hype everything because everyone has a stake in Bitcoin.”\n\nCoinbase’s fundraising success — particularly from established financial groups like NYSE and BBVA — must be welcome news to that community, which has seen the value of Bitcoin erode by around 75% over the past year. Ehrsam says that the price decline did not affect investor interest, and optimistically suggests that it will ultimately improve the Bitcoin ecosystem by teaching important lessons about cyclicality and expense management to cryptocurrency miners.\n\n“Price volatility isn’t good for certain uses of Bitcoin but, in that same time period, we went from 600,000 users to 2.1 million users, so it hasn’t caused the number of people signing up on our site to go down,” Ehrsam says.\n\nCoinbase has now raised over $105 million in total VC funding since its 2012 formation. It currently employs around 100 people (50 of whom are full-time in the company’s San Francisco headquarters), and is hoping to soon roll out a new sort of site for outside developers who want to build apps on top of Bitcoin.\n\nSign up for Term Sheet, our daily newsletter on deals and deal-makers.', 'Robert M Faiella, the bitcoin trader charged alongside BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem, has been sentenced to four years imprisonment in New York.\n\nFaiella, otherwise known as \'BTCKing\', pleaded guilty to operating an illegal money transmission business after he exchanged fiat currency for bitcoins that were then used to buy drugs on the Silk Road marketplace.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, Faiella said:\n\n""At the time of the event, I saw no other way ... it still doesn’t mitigate that I broke the law.""\n\nFaiella, a 53 year-old Florida native, is a former plumber who claimed he had turned to the bitcoin exchange business to support his family after becoming disabled with back problems. He and Shrem were arrested in January 2014.\n\nSentenced by US District Judge Jed Rakoff, who also presided over Shrem\'s case, Faiella faced a five-year maximum term.\n\nRelated cases\n\nShrem himself was sentenced in December to two years in prison after making a plea deal with prosecutors. While currently living at home, he must surrender himself at a date yet to be determined and any travel prior to that needs to be approved by a judge.\n\nHe was not able to obtain permission to attend the recent North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami.\n\nShrem also admitted his actions had broken the law, and said his sentence was light considering the 30-year maximum he had faced, and up to 60 months even with the plea bargain.\n\nHe also had to forfeit $950,000 in profits and will have three years of supervised release after his sentence is complete.\n\nRoss Ulbricht, accused of being the ringleader of the Silk Road operation called \'Dread Pirate Roberts\', is currently on trial for drug trafficking, money laundering and computer hacking in New York.\n\nUlbricht has not made a plea deal and faces life in prison if found guilty.\n\nGavel image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The profit margins have become thinner and thinner, and now may be non-existent for many in the industry. Some reports have as many as 30,000 miners leaving the industry since BTC has entered the $300-and-below range. Many Bitcoin critics are eager to take this as a sign of Bitcoin’s inherent weakness of value. Is that the case? Can this purging of clouded, corporate miners, in fact, be a good thing?\n\nIn order to take advantage of the swollen BTC price in late 2013, the “Cloud Hashing” or corporate cloud mining industry took off. Plenty of people worldwide suddenly became very interested in investing in the cloud mining concept. The amount of miners has passed 75000 in total. Question is: Does Bitcoin need 75k+ miners to be effective?\n\nMIT’s Technology Review spoke with Harvard Associate Professor Benjamin Edelman. His research on Bitcoin says to him that these current issues can cause a more widespread problem in the industry.\n\n“I think that miners are pulling out and dumping Bitcoin to make up for lost revenue, which itself changes the value,” says Edelman. Those that do continue mining will contribute to the problem because they will have to immediately sell any Bitcoins they mine, he says.\n\nAlso read: HashCoins Provides Hosted Mining Services You Can Trust\n\nAnother reaction by the Bitcoin community could be that home miners re-enter the market. This war of attrition doesn’t necessarily mean there aren’t enough miners. The mix of corporate investors and small-time home miners can change back to the mix it was before the bubble in late 2013. Maybe the problem with Bitcoin has been too many chefs in the kitchen? Bitcoin price in US Dollar values didn’t have any problem rising thousands of percent in value annually when cloud mining was just a novel idea not ready for prime time. It seems the mom-and-pop miners, who were working from home, were doing a fine job by BTC. The difficulty in the algorithm is adjusting as we speak so the CPU rate remains consistent.\n\nWhat I know about mining fits in a thimble, but you have to admit Bitcoin price, if that is a measure of strength you use (I do not), was rising very consistently before the era of Cloud Hashing. I would rather have more mining jobs, and more decentralized mining than larger groups of investors and corporations dominating the heart of Bitcoin, just to earn a fast buck. Maybe a “back to basics” approach to mining is just what the doctor ordered for BTC, and it is price?\n\nTo me, it matters not, because Bitcoin’s value goes well beyond any mere US Dollar price. If you simply see Bitcoin as an investment, that’s a bigger problem than any relative price drop. Bitcoin is a revolutionary global information technology long before it was a speculative investment asset. Govern your actions accordingly.\n\nWould you notice if cloud miners went away tomorrow? Does the Bitcoin currency and community need more home miners who can compete without several blade servers? Share above and comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Lighthouse, the bitcoin-powered crowdfunding application, has officially launched.\n\nThe beta version of the app, which developer Mike Hearn described as a specialized wallet for decentralized crowdfunding, is now publicly available for download.\n\nThe release follows months of development, which included an investment from noted bitcoin entrepreneur Olivier Janssens.\n\nThe app is designed to function as a streamlined tool for using smart contracts to commit pledges to particular projects, which can range from bitcoin development initiatives to charity drives. Currently, the only project available for Lighthouse is a 3.5 BTC fundraiser for Medic Mobile.\n\nHearn said in an interview that Lighthouse differs from platforms like Kickstarter for a number of reasons, including a lack of processing charges and a built-in gallery of projects.\n\nOn the latter point, Hearn suggested that project galleries should be just as decentralized as the funding element, and anticipates directories taking shape alongside a gallery he is hosting for Lighthouse initiatives.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Lighthouse is really only about moving money around, and I think this is going to be one of the things that people find confusing about it. It\'s not Kickstarter in a downloadable app that\'s peer to peer to peer. It\'s the way of handling bitcoins.""\n\nHow it works\n\nLighthouse employs a system of project files that enable users to make donations to projects of their choosing, as well as create their own. The first step involves setting up the wallet and depositing funds.\n\nSupporters of a particular initiative can then download the project file and upload it to their Lighthouse wallet, which gives the user access to the project page where they can see the total amount being raised, past pledges and supportive messages for those involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Hearn, the app doesn\'t necessarily need to function as a means for raising funds for development projects. Rather, he sees Lighthouse as a potential funding vehicle for a variety of purposes.\n\n""I think its perfectly usable for people who are comfortable with bitcoin, but aren\'t developers or are tech-savvy. You could crowdfund, you know, me and my friends go to a concert and we\'ve got to \'group buy\' concert tickets, or group buy a laser tag day or something.""\n\n""It\'s not a tool that I want or intend for only bitcoin developers to use,"" he added. ""Even though that may be where it starts.""\n\nBreaking down crowdfunding\n\nIn tandem with Lighthouse lies the concept of the project gallery, of which Hearn\'s Vinumeris Crypto Projects Gallery is the first of what he hopes to be a cluster of galleries that serve – or compete for – particular markets.\n\nHearn said that because Kickstarter is, at its heart, a project gallery and a financial gateway for funding, decentralizing that process can lead to a more vibrant process by which projects are discovered and supported.\n\n""What I\'d like to see, by unbundling these things, ... is a competitive market of communities and community builders where people are building these project gallery sites,"" he said. ""People can compete on building really awesome sites.""\n\nBuilding a case for bitcoin\n\nWhen asked about demand for the service, Hearn said that he isn\'t expecting huge volumes of users given the size of the bitcoin community today, as well as the niche nature of bitcoin-based crowdfunding itself.\n\nHearn said he sees a role for cryptocurrency-based finance because of the costs associated with digital crowdfunding.\n\nIdeally, he continued, Lighthouse will attract users not necessarily because it involves bitcoin, but because of the economic benefits of using the app to conduct most cost-effective transactions.\n\n""This is building the case for bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nImages via Lighthouse, Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In an interview at the Georgia Straight office, Esmaeilpour said she hopes to learn more about the demographics of users of Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency that isn’t issued by a government and doesn’t require banks to operate.\n\n“Is it people from a higher socioeconomic background who are more likely to adopt cryptocurrencies?” the Burnaby resident asked. “Because when you don’t come from economic security, how likely are you to adopt something?”\n\nFounded in September 2014, the club aims to raise awareness and promote the use of Bitcoin on UBC’s Point Grey campus. A key to achieving its goals is the development of a Bitcoin wallet app for UBC students.\n\nBitcoin wallets are used by their owners to organize their funds and make payments. In the new book Bitcoin for the Befuddled (No Starch Press), authors Conrad Barski and Chris Wilmer explain that a wallet is a collection of addresses and their corresponding private keys.\n\nSimilar to a bank account number, a Bitcoin address is a string of letters and numbers. Once you share your address with others, they can send you money.\n\nLikewise, a private key is akin to a personal identification number (PIN). It’s a code needed to authorize the spending of money associated with an address.\n\nBitcoin wallets can be divided into those using hot storage and those using cold storage. In hot storage, the private keys exist on an Internet-connected computer or device for ease of use. Cold storage sees the private keys kept on an offline computer or even on paper for greater security.\n\nAs Barski and Wilmer note, people use wallet programs to manage their addresses and private keys. There are many programs available, each boasting different levels of safety, security, and convenience.\n\n“Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank,” the authors write. “But being your own bank comes with great responsibility and requires you to take serious security precautions.”\n\nBitcoin for the Befuddled explains wallets and other key concepts. Courtesy No Starch Press\n\nIn a joint interview, computer-science students Walter Cavinaw and Albert Kim, who are members of the UBC Bitcoin Club’s technology committee, revealed that they are working with the company Love Will, creator of the Pheeva wallet app for Android, Chrome, and iOS. In September 2014, Love Will launched a Georgia Institute of Technology–branded Bitcoin app for the iPhone.\n\nCavinaw noted the club would like to see the Alma Mater Society and businesses at UBC accept and offer incentives for using Bitcoin payments. They also hope to gain approval from university administrators to use the school’s branding in a UBC version of the Pheeva app, which could be rolled out later this year.\n\n“I don’t expect there to be a whole lot of actual use,” Kim, a Richmond resident, said at the Straight office. “I don’t expect there to be a lot of dollar transactions. But it will be one of the most effective ways of getting the word out on campus, particularly if it’s UBC–branded.”\n\nComputer-science students Albert Kim and Walter Cavinaw are working to bring a Bitcoin wallet app to UBC. Stephen Hui\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Vogel advises everyone who’s considering using a Bitcoin wallet program to look at the mobile, desktop, hardware, and web options listed on the community-run site Bitcoin.org. The Port Coquitlam resident is the cofounder and CEO of Netcoins, a Vancouver-based startup developing a web app that will make it easy for stores to sell bitcoins to their customers.\n\nVogel told the Straight he uses the Bitcoin Wallet app, which features a “simple, clean interface”, on his Android smartphone. While this mobile app gives you full control over your money, there are web wallet services, such as Coinbase, which require you to trust a third party.\n\nAccording to Vogel, newcomers should be aware that their bitcoins may not be secure in the wallet program of their choosing.\n\n“I think diversifying and keeping bitcoin on multiple platforms—keeping it in multiple wallets—at least protects you from any kind of major failure,” Vogel said at the Spring incubator’s Chinatown office. “That’s probably the best advice.”\n\nNetcoins CEO Michael Vogel warns that Bitcoin wallet programs are susceptible to hacking. Stephen Hui\n\nIn December 2014, Blockchain disclosed that a “few hundred” addresses held by users of its popular online wallet service had been compromised by a development error. A white-hat hacker withdrew hundreds of bitcoins from these addresses, later returning the funds to their rightful owners.\n\nOn January 5, leading Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp suspended service, saying that some of its wallets had been compromised. The following day, Bitstamp announced that “less than” 19,000 bitcoins had been stolen. (As of January 16, one bitcoin was valued at about US$210.)\n\nThe UBC Bitcoin Club is organizing a January 27 panel discussion entitled UBC Bitcoin 101, which will introduce attendees to the six-year-old cryptocurrency. The speakers will be Vanbex Group CEO Lisa Cheng, Digital Finance Institute chair Manie Eagar, and Quadriga CX director Michael Patryn.\n\nCavinaw asserted that UBC is an opportune place to launch a wallet app because its students are among the “most intelligent” people around.\n\n“If we were to go just out on the street, you know, we might not get people who are passionate about changing the world or whatever,” Cavinaw said. “But UBC students definitely fall into that category. They want to change the way things work. Bitcoin is important for the future, because it allows people to do things that they haven’t been able to do in the past.”\n\nThe UBC Bitcoin Club presents UBC Bitcoin 101 at the Sauder School of Business on Tuesday (January 27) at 6 p.m.', 'Trustatom has raised early seed funding to the tune of $100,000 with which it will launch CredyCo, a cryptographic due diligence service built on top of bitcoin\'s blockchain.\n\nThe round was led by a group of investors that included entrepreneur Brian Cartmell and Gyft co-founder Vinny Lingham.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Trustatom co-founder Yurii Rashkovskii framed the news as an early step in connecting the technology of bitcoin with “the real world”.\n\n“The most important thing from our perspective is to find users for bitcoin and blockchain technology outside of the traditional and core use of bitcoin,” Rashkovskii said, adding:\n\n“Unlike most of the projects that are active in the space today that cater mostly to the same bitcoin community, what we try to do here is expand that and find applications for blockchain technology.”\n\nCredyCo will be one such solution. Built on technology provided by the Canadian-based Trustatom, it is a document verification \'software as a service\' (SaaS) that Lingham envisions as a niche solution for the venture capital industry.\n\nThe company describes the service as using ""a smart contracts and identity technology built on top of the blockchain to ensure the credibility and irrefutability of all statements"".\n\nTargeting venture capitalists\n\nTrustatom ID is the heart of the company\'s proprietary technology. The company describes it as a “mobile privacy-respecting identity and credentials application”, helping businesses automate \'know your customer\' practices and allowing their customers to authorize transactions with cryptographic signatures.\n\nCredyCo will be an SaaS built on that technology, and will aim to automate document-based due diligence processes for companies seeking funding.\n\nFor example, firms will be able to record their financial and growth metrics securely, allowing investors to more efficiently assess companies’ credibility and thereby potentially shortening the closure time and increasing the number of successful deals.\n\nRashkovskii said the service will give companies seeking funding “a strong connection to identities and their credentials and just about anything that can be signed by a third party about you”.\n\n“If you think about the investment market, or rather, the way they have been operating, it hasn\'t really changed much in the last decade,” he said.\n\nHe added:\n\n“This is a way to get this portable trust that enables bitcoin in the first place, and apply it to something different and new using what already exists for things outside the monetary aspects.”\n\nBuilding bitcoin use cases\n\nLingham, who is also a Trustatom advisor, was bullish on the potential of blockchain applications, echoing Rashkovskii’s thoughts on closing the gap that separates bitcoin users from mainstream consumers.\n\n“The reality is that the price is not going to move until you find actual functional utility for bitcoins,” Lingham said. “Transferring value of bitcoins is not very interesting, in a sense, because the value fluctuates over time.”\n\nThe Gyft CEO has found success with his mobile gift card startup and its growing bitcoin customer base.\n\nHowever, on the price and functionality of bitcoin, he added:\n\n“There’s not enough volume to make this thing liquid enough – that’s why it’s so volatile.”\n\nThat is also why it is imperative that entrepreneurs and developers in the space begin to shift focus to consumers outside of bitcoin, Lingham said, by building products and services with industrial use cases like time stamping, or establishing and transferring property rights.\n\n""Blockchain and modern cryptographic tricks and schemes allow for new kinds of services to flourish,” said software developer and Trustatom advisor Oleg Andreev. “Companies that provide you with an infrastructure, tools and apps, yet almost completely reduce liability and counter-party risks for their clients.”\n\nHe added:\n\n""’Outsourcing’ soon will stop being an ‘unfortunate tradeoff’ and will be regarded simply as a mutually beneficial cooperation of professionals.”\n\nImages via Trustatom, Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Digital currencies such as Bitcoin are tipped to have a seminal year in igaming, with many operators , affiliates and jurisdictions looking to these ’lines of computer code’ to service a growing demand from players wishing to spend and play with Bitcoins.\n\nSBC Business Correspondent Mark McGuinness talked to Tauri Tiitsaar, the COO of Coingaming.io a leading platform provider which specializes in the provisioning of Bitcoin crypto currency solutions for the iGaming sector.\n\nSBC: For our readers that haven’t perhaps heard of Bitcoin, can you tell us about this alternative payment solution?\n\nTauri: Bitcoin is the most popular of what are commonly referred to as cryptocurrencies or internet based money. It can be described or thought of as any other foreign currency. For example if you go abroad on business or family holiday, you need to know how much things cost at your destination in their local currency, how to pay, where to pay and so forth. With Bitcoin it is very similar, but it is a global payment method. First you exchange your everyday currency often referred to as ’Fiat currency’ to Bitcoin, you get an online wallet where you store your Bitcoins and you start making payments. You can even get a debit card to make payments in stores and several large retailing companies such as Microsoft and Amazon are already accepting Bitcoin as a payment method.\n\nSBC: How large is the Bitcoin market?\n\nTauri: Compared to one year ago – it is very big! This currency has more users than some country specific currencies and therefore presents a huge opportunity for igaming brands to reach a large group of new players. Each and every person or a company using Bitcoin is directly contributing to increasing awareness by telling their friends or by announcing it through social networks and other forms of digital communication. The usage is increasing every day as people become aware of the benefits over “fiat based paper money“. Of course it may not be as big as Euros or Dollars yet but who knows, maybe one day it will happen! I am quite sure that if you ask people on the high street they will have heard of Bitcoin and with the continued distrust and disdain that consumers have towards traditional financial institutions can only contribute to further demand – after all Bitcoin is a people powered currency and payment method.\n\nSBC: What are the benefits of using Bitcoins?\n\nTauri: Over the years’ the banking industry and financial sectors have been receiving a lot of negative publicity over how they treat customers with miss-selling scandals, hidden charges, costs and so on.\n\nTherefore two of the most significant benefits of using Bitcoin by far are that there are either very low fees or no fees involved with the transactions between customer and the merchant. Another major benefit is they are fast. For example when you pay a cheque from another bank into your bank, your bank shall often hold that money for several days, because it can’t trust that the funds are really available to credit your bank account with. Likewise bank or wire transfers can be another process which always takes longer than anticipated for the funds to clear. Bitcoin transactions are far faster and can be instantaneous which means users have access to funds quicker and can use those funds for whatever they wish.\n\nSBC: Is Bitcoin trustworthy given the backlash against the traditional banking sector?\n\nTauri: Bitcoin is as trustworthy as any other currency once you know a little more about it. It can be more volatile than say the paper based Dollar or Euro, but it also offers much more flexibility. Whoever uses it should apply the same security as they would with fiat paper based currency or payment instrument. You do not share your bank account logins, debit card PIN code or cash with others. With Bitcoin you simply apply the same logic – you have an online wallet, you should keep the logins to it safe. If you are using a debit card then keep the PIN code safe as well. At the end of the day it comes down to the individual user to exercise the requisite care themselves. Bitcoin is here to stay and it is as safe as you keep it like any other financial instrument.\n\nSBC: Has there been much interest from the online gambling industry for Bitcoin?\n\nTauri: Growth was perhaps slower a few years back, but since Bitcoin has grown in popularity more and more people from the online gambling sector are starting to see the growth potential. Gambling businesses are of course very much driven by numbers and return on investment, so the early adopters of Bitcoin enabled gambling products are showing strong growth numbers which makes others wish to jump on-board the bandwagon.\n\nGiven the lower transaction fees associated with using Bitcoin both from a player’s perspective moving money into and out of the operators’ gaming platform and for the operators over other more traditional payment methods, provides a strong business case and justification for more gaming operators and platforms to enable Bitcoin acceptance.\n\nSBC: Does Bitcoin therefore have the potential to transform legacy gambling infrastructures?\n\nTauri: Innovation and change always polarises opinion both positively and negatively. With most disruption in the digital economy, it is consumers driving the change not so much the corporates. With that Bitcoin users tend to be a younger and therefore much sought after demographic segment that has grown up with digital technology, buying virtual goods and playing social games. They are able to embrace change very swiftly without any hang-ups or preconceptions. It’s a cliché for sure but they are the now generation not just pushing change but transformation and that means constantly challenging the status quo or legacy systems of the way things are done. Just in the same way as mobile has increased the reach and accessibility of gaming to a wider audience, it could be fair to say it was the consumers demanding the change as against the operators foreseeing the demand. Bitcoin can certainly help modernise existing gambling infrastructures and business models. There are hundreds of millions of potential consumers that are regarded as ’under banked’ and may not have access to traditional banks, ATM’s or debit cards. But yet that same group are accessing the internet and wish to buy goods and services – so it’s a numbers game and Bitcoin could by a means to service a relatively large and growing consumer market who wants to do things differently from the previous generation.\n\nSBC: How sustainable is Bitcoin?\n\nTauri: Bitcoin was made to stay, the currency at the moment is volatile, just like many traditional fiat based currencies, but the more users it has, the less volatile it is. It is already been added by PayPal; Dell is selling computers for Bitcoin, Virgin Galactic is selling space voyages for Bitcoin and Air Baltic is selling flight tickets for Bitcoin. It is clearly visible that more and more companies are adopting Bitcoin as a payment solution as they understand the benefits and continued usage by consumers. In 10 years it could play a very big part in the world economy.\n\nIn terms of igaming, a number of poker, casino and sportsbook providers have adopted Bitcoin and we are providing operators with the necessary tools to run their Bitcoin gaming business. I suppose the developments we expect and require are the same as operating any online business; you investigate trends and how to differentiate your business models. It is quite clear that crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin are here to stay, as a lot of the gaming companies have integrated Bitcoin and more will follow suit throughout this year.\n\n________________________\n\nTauri Tiitsaar COO Coingaming.io', 'BBVA Ventures, el proyecto de capital riesgo del grupo BBVA que invierte en startups, ha realizado una inversión en Coinbase, plataforma para realizar transacciones con la divisa virtual Bitcoin, según ha informado la entidad en un comunicado.\n\nCoinbase, fundada en junio de 2012 en San Francisco, ofrece a consumidores y empresas la posibilidad de comprar, vender y realizar transacciones fácilmente con Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin es la aplicación más importante a nivel mundial de la tecnología \'blockchain\', un registro \'online\' público que verifica las transacciones con la moneda digital.\n\n""En esencia Bitcoin es un protocolo descentralizado que permite el intercambio de valor entre partes en cualquier lugar del mundo, algo que potencialmente podría alterar los servicios financieros"", ha explicado el director de BBVA Ventures, Jay Reinemann, quien ha asegurado que Coinbase se encuentra en ""una de las mejores posiciones posibles"" para conocer los nuevos desarrollos y aplicaciones para esta tecnología.\n\nA enero de 2015, Coinbase cuenta con 2,1 millones de consumidores que usan su cartera virtual, 38.000 negocios que procesan pagos con Bitcoins a través de su plataforma y 7.000 desarrolladores que construyen nuevos servicios basados en su interfaz de programación de aplicaciones (API).\n\nEl objetivo de BBVA Ventures es encontrar y ayudar a las compañías más innovadoras en los servicios financieros.

01/21/2015,"['A Bitcoin exchange operator who pled guilty to supplying $1 million in digital currency to people buying drugs on Silk Road was sentenced to four years in prison Tuesday.\n\nRobert Faiella, who used the name BTCking online, had been arrested last year and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He had been charged along with Charlie Shrem, former CEO of the Bitcoin exchanger BitInstant. Shrem was sentenced last month to two years in prison.\n\nAccording to court documents, from December 2011 until October 2013 when Silk Road was seized by federal agents, Faiella, 55, operated a Bitcoin exchange on the Silk Road site that allowed drug buyers and sellers to anonymously exchange cash for Bitcoins — the only currency used on the Silk Road site to buy drugs and other paraphernalia marketed through the site. Faiella obtained the Bitcoins through BitInstant, then sold them at a profit to Silk Road users.\n\nAuthorities say Shrem knew about Faiella’s activities and personally processed his orders, giving Faiella a discount on high-volume trades of Bitcoins that he purchased for Silk Road buyers. Faiella exchanged tens of thousands of Bitcoins a week for Silk Road users until the site was closed by authorities in October 2013.\n\nTo purchase Bitcoins for use on Silk Road, Faiella submitted orders to BitInstant specifying the number of Bitcoins he wanted to purchase and provided an email address. A third company, which handled the cash transactions, replied with an email instructing where to deposit the cash. The latter included a handling fee attached to it that was designed to help the company identify each transaction to the proper purchaser.\n\nFor example, one handling fee might be .32 cents, another would be .45 cents. Customers would be told to pay $200.32 or $200.45, with no customer being given the same handling fee on the same day so that the company could deposit the Bitcoins into the proper anonymous account.\n\nCustomers would then deposit the cash in person at the specified local bank, directing the money to a bank account owned by the cash-processing firm. Once the cash deposit was verified, the Bitcoins were transferred to the customer’s Bitcoin account of choice.\n\nFaiella promised in an advertisement for his service that Bitcoins would be deposited so fast that they would likely be in the buyer’s Bitcoin account before they returned from the bank.', ""The backers of Coinbase's US$75 million investment round bring more institutional credibility to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Mixing large financial institutions with powerfully connected individuals, the group represents a continued belief in the future development and implementation of Bitcoin.\n\nAnnouncing the completion of US$75 million Series C round of funding for the digital currency platform, Coinbase has set a new record in the Bitcoin world for the largest amount of venture capital invested in a digital currency startup. More importantly though, the range of investors putting money into the company now extends beyond the tech-centric firms, such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and Bitcoin-specific groups, such as Crypto Currency Partners. The addition of USAA Bank, the investment arm of the American Insurance giant, and the New York Stock Exchange itself, will make many critics of Bitcoin, and investors previously wary of the digital currency world, re-evaluate their positions.\n\nWe will work with @coinbase to bring additional transparency to bitcoin pricing t.co/Q9xjcXMmjl pic.twitter.com/gJaOiCScNM — NYSE (@nyse) January 20, 2015\n\nWell-known investor Warren Buffett has famously referred to Bitcoin as a “mirage,” advising his followers to “stay away” from the digital currency. His position was attacked at the 2014 CoinSummit by early Coinbase investor Marc Andreessen, who likened it as the “standard trope of technology criticism by people who don’t understand technology.” But the attitude of caution around Bitcoin continues, with bitcoinobituaries.com even collecting a continuous stream of articles in the media about the coming “end of Bitcoin.”\n\nCore Bitcoin developer and CEO of Dunvegan Space Systems Jeff Garzik says that Bitcoin adoption will come instead in a series of ever larger investing cycles:\n\n“Part of bitcoin's path to mainstream financial instrument will involve experimentation (2009–2012), angel and VC investment (2013–2015+), and finally larger, Fortune 500-sized early movers. Investment comes in waves, each new waves learning lessons from the last.”\n\nThe involvement of such large players so early on in 2015 could show it to be a record year for investment. With US$314 million invested into Bitcoin companies in 2014, and just under a quarter of that already invested in 2015, critics are pointing to this growing cycle of investment as a sign of Bitcoin movement towards the mainstream.\n\nHaving financial institutions get behind the growth of Coinbase will do much to re-assure both investors and users that there is much more of substance in the industry than some had previously thought. For Coinbase itself, one important arm of its work is signing up merchants to their Bitcoin payment service. Through previous successes, including Dell, Expedia and PayPal company Braintree, the company has gained many users' trust through their association with these brands.\n\nWith the investments from the financial powerhouses involved in yesterday's funding round, we therefore might expect to see a similar effect upon the merchant side of Coinbase's business, as the digital currency startup benefits from the reputation an investor like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) brings with it. The growth of merchants accepting Bitcoin increases possible spending within the Bitcoin ecosystem, and also exposes more shoppers to the concept of Bitcoin where they may not have previously heard of it.\n\nSpeaking of their minority investment into Coinbase, NYSE President Tom Farley stated:\n\n“With this investment, we are tapping into a new asset class by teaming up with a leading platform that is bringing transparency, security and confidence to an important growth market. We look forward to supporting Coinbase’s growth utilizing our global distribution capabilities and market expertise.”\n\nAlong with the large financial funds and companies getting involved in the funding round, investment also came from two private individuals, former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit, and former Thompson Reuters CEO Thomas Glocer. Both of these again bring a level of prestige to the Coinbase brand that companies operating in the Bitcoin space are desperately in need of when they are held up against the strings of hacks, thefts and frauds that have dogged the digital currency's previous few years.\n\nGarzik expanded on his comments to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“As we saw with former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt joining BitPay's advisory board, the news that Coinbase investors now include larger institutions such as the NYSE, USAA bank, Spanish bank BBVA and former Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit demonstrates that Bitcoin is further along the path to worldwide acceptance as a mainstream financial instrument. The Winklevoss COIN ETF and SecondMarket's OTCBB vehicle becoming available to every Schwab and eTrade customer will be another huge milestone for Bitcoin.”\n\nOther payment platforms trying to set themselves apart from what's seen as the “unstable” world of Bitcoin are Circle and BitPay. All three startups have offered “automatic conversion” of BTC payments into a chosen national currency, again taking a step to reassure merchant users that the underlying technological benefits of instant payments and low transaction fees that Bitcoin possess can be separated from the recent price instability. With yesterday's record investment round, and the increased investor interest this will lead to in the sector, all three look set to make further gains on the road to widespread Bitcoin acceptance.\n\nDid you enjoy this article? You may also be interested in reading these ones:"", 'On the third day of his trial, Ross Ulbricht looked calm for a man who could soon be sentenced to life in prison. The gangly 30-year-old’s parents, Lyn and Kirk, sat behind him in a wood-paneled courtroom fifteen stories above lower Manhattan last Thursday. During breaks in testimony, Ulbricht turned in his chair and smiled broadly at them from beneath a poof of brown hair. “Did you have a good lunch?” Lyn asked her son after a pause on the third day of proceedings. Ross grinned and shook his head. “I’ll tell you about it later.” Lunch in prison doesn’t usually come with an unadulterated endorsement.\n\nUlbricht, an Eagle Scout with a master’s degree in materials science and engineering who friends say is well-liked and sensitive, is facing grave charges. Fifteen months ago, he was arrested and accused of drug trafficking, computer hacking and running a criminal enterprise, among other charges. His case has become a flash point for Internet activists, who worry a conviction could deal a blow to free speech on the Internet.\n\nUlbricht’s arrest was the culmination of a two-year investigation into the seedy online bazaar Silk Road, where the narcotics-hungry could find drugs for sale in exchange for Bitcoin, a difficult-to-trace digital currency. Silk Road was controlled by a shadowy website administrator with the moniker Dread Pirate Roberts, who prosecutors say took home millions in commissions on more than $1 billion worth of drug deals and other transactions. Roberts also allegedly used the site to order the murders of six people.\n\nThe central question in this trial is whether Ulbricht is indeed the Dread Pirate Roberts. Government prosecutors say that’s the case; they want to send Ulbricht to prison for 20 years to life for his alleged crimes. But there’s more at stake here than charges against a single man: Open Internet activists, some of whom have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Ulbricht’s defense, say his case is a matter of online freedom.\n\n(Read more: What Was Silk Road? Refresh Your Memory as Ross Ulbricht Goes to Trial)\n\nA closely-watched case\n\nTraditionally, website operators have not been held liable for illegal activity carried out on their platforms. An appellate court decision gave the social network MySpace legal immunity in 2008, for instance, after an underage teenage girl was sexually assaulted by someone she met through the website. Activists, however, see Ulbricht’s trial as a landmark case, worrying that a conviction could stifle free speech on the Internet.\n\nLast July, the judge on the case ruled that if Ulbricht created Silk Road as a drug trafficking haven as the government alleges, then he’s vulnerable to the narcotics conspiracy charges against him. But the defense argues Ulbricht only founded the site as an “economic experiment,” not as a narcotics ring—even if that’s what Silk Road became. If that argument holds up but Ulbricht is still found guilty of some charge or all charges, it could have a chilling effect on digital free speech.\n\n“At what point are you liable for what happens on a site that you start?” says Hanni Fakhoury, an attorney for the non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation who’s been watching the case as a neutral observer. “If the government indicted every time someone posted a prostitution ad on Craigslist, [Craigslist founder] Craig Newmark would be in prison all day.” While Fakhoury believes the case could have broader implications for how the government prosecutes website operators for their users’ behavior, he admits Silk Road is at “the far end of the spectrum” of normal Internet activity.\n\nThen there’s the question of how federal agents investigated Silk Road. The defense, led by Joshua Dratel, an expert but somewhat rumpled attorney who has represented high-profile terror suspects and Guantanamo Bay detainees, says the government seized data from the site’s servers without a warrant.\n\nThe judge threw out the defense’s motion on those grounds, but the claim opened up the door to several important questions: How exactly did the feds find Silk Road’s servers? Were Ulbricht’s constitutional rights violated in the process? Less than a week and just one witness into the trial, it’s hard to tell how these questions will play out. But the testimony has so far been revelatory, unveiling a federal sting operation worthy of a blockbuster script.\n\n(In the magazine: The Secret Web: Where Drugs, Porn and Murder Live Online)\n\nHow Ulbricht was busted\n\nThe government’s first witness was Department of Homeland Security investigator Jared Der-Yeghiayan. Der-Yeghiayan says he began looking into Silk Road in early 2012 after federal investigators noticed vendors were using the website to sell drugs. Der-Yeghiayan testified that he made more than 50 drug buys and logged thousands of hours on the website until it was shut down in October 2013.\n\nBy August 2013, Der-Yeghiayan managed to seize the account of a lead website administrator named Cirrus. He then used the account to communicate with Dread Pirate Roberts several times a week, with Roberts unaware “Cirrus” was now a government agent.\n\nAfter Der-Yeghiayan took over Cirrus’ account in August 2013, he began reporting directly to Dread. Dread paid Der-Yeghiayan about $1,000 per week to manage Silk Road’s forums and user questions. The pair were cordial, often asking each other how they were doing. “Thank you for looking after the forums,” Dread told Der-Yeghiayan in one chat.\n\nIn another post, Dread addressed users’ criticism that he was taking a commission on each drug trade. Some users were calling it a “tax.” Dread objected to Silk Road being compared to the government, and instead called it a broker’s fee. Like any successful private enterprise, Dread said, Silk Road needed to support itself. “Do you think this site built itself? Do you have any idea of the risks?,” he said.\n\nThe Sting\n\nIn September 2013, an investigator on the case named Gary Alford told Der-Yeghiayan that a 29-year-old former University of Texas physics student named Ross Ulbricht appeared to be a “pretty good match” to Dread Pirate Roberts’ profile. The FBI got a warrant for Ulbricht’s arrest. By the end of that month, a team of agents set out for San Francisco, where Ulbricht lived under the name “Josh Terrey.”\n\nAccording to Der-Yeghiayan’s testimony, plainclothes federal agents fanned out across San Francisco’s Glen Park neighborhood on the afternoon of Oct. 1, 2013, monitoring public places with free Wi-Fi access. The plan was to catch Ulbricht signed into Dred Pirate Roberts’ Silk Road account. That way, the government said, it could link Ulbricht the man with Dread the moniker.\n\nAt around 2:40 p.m., Der-Yeghiayan settled into Bello, a coffee shop near Ulbricht’s apartment, and logged into the Silk Road administrators’ chat. Dread Pirate Roberts was online briefly until 2:47 p.m. Just minutes after Dread signed off, federal agents saw Ulbricht leave his apartment and walk down the street in the direction of Bello, right where Der-Yeghiayan was still sitting. Der-Yeghiayan ducked out of Bello while the team watched as Ulbricht waited at a crosswalk 50 feet away before entering the shop.\n\nUlbricht left Bello almost immediately, apparently because it was too crowded. Ulbricht walked thirty feet down the street and disappeared into the Glen Park Branch Library. A few moments later, Dread Pirate Roberts signed on to Silk Road’s chat.\n\n“hi,” [sic] typed Der-Yeghiayan into a chat with Dread, posing undercover as Cirrus. “are you there?” The goal, Der-Yeghiayan says, was to get Ulbricht to log on to Silk Road as Dread, proving the man and the moniker were one in the same.\n\n“hey,” Dread responded.\n\n“how are you doing?” said Der-Yeghiayan.\n\n“i’m ok, you?” said Dread.\n\n“good,” said Der-Yeghiayan. “can you check one of the flagged messages for me?”\n\n“sure,” said Dread. “let me log in.”\n\nIt was a trap. Dread Pirate Roberts was now signed in to both the chat and the Silk Road website. FBI agents entered the library, snatched Ulbricht’s laptop and handcuffed him. Der-Yeghiayan walked up the stairs and inspected the computer. Ulbricht was signed in to Silk Road. It was Dread Pirate Roberts’ account.\n\nEven a skilled defense attorney like Dratel would have trouble accounting for Ulbricht being caught red-handed. But Dratel has an explanation: Ulbricht was framed.\n\nYes, Ulbricht founded Silk Road 2011, Dratel said, but he quickly distanced himself from the online bazaar. Ulbricht never profited from the heroin, cocaine and ecstasy deals trafficked on its pages, Dratel said, and he certainly didn’t order the murders of six people. According to Dratel, Ulbricht was lured back to the website shortly before he was arrested in late 2013 by its then-administrator: Mark Karpeles, chief executive of the Japan-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which allowed anyone to convert cash into Bitcoin.\n\n“Our position is that [Karpeles] set up Mr. Ulbricht,” Dratel said in court.\n\nHere’s the twist: Federal agents were ready to indict Karpeles for running Silk Road right up until September 2013, one month before they arrested Ulbricht. Even Der-Yeghiayan himself, after months of undercover drug buys, believed Karpeles was using Silk Road as leverage to drive up Bitcoin’s value.\n\nUnder questioning on Thursday, Der-Yeghiayan says he was ready to move on Karpeles. What happened? Dratel insinuated that Karpeles’ lawyer met with the feds and offered to give up the name of the real masterminds behind the Silk Road website. The court adjourned before his questioning ended. It’s not hard to see the defense’s argument here: Karpeles was about to get busted, so he trapped Ulbricht. Karpeles adamantly denies he was ever involved in Silk Road.\n\nFor now, the truth seems as elusive as it was to Der-Yeghiayan in June 2013, when in an email to federal agents about the identities of Silk Road users, he confessed he was clueless. “Sheesh, who’s on first?” Der-Yeghiayan said, according to testimony. It’s a sentiment the rest of the courtroom shares.', 'Bitcoin (""BTC"") isn\'t only recognized as the first cryptocurrency; it\'s also the basis for every other crypto-coin that\'s popped up since it was formally introduced in 2009. ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" (the pseudonym used by the person or the group of people who created bitcoin) designed it as a peer-to-peer system that relies on users to keep working. Also, all transactions are recorded on a public ledger (called ""block chain""), so even though no name or email address is associated with an account, the system\'s not entirely anonymous.\n\nSimilar alternative currencies follow that structure even now, though they add features of their own, as well. Litecoin, for instance, was designed for faster transactions (the average confirmation time for each bitcoin transfer is 11 minutes as of January 2015, because it has to be verified by a miner -- more on this later), while Quarkcoin promises a more secure system. Others rely on their novelty more than anything, such as Dogecoin, which likely appeals most to fans of the (in)famous doge meme and Coinye West that was seriously a thing until Kanye West went onstage to court and didn\'t let it finish had it shut down.\n\nNow, if you\'re wondering if you should invest in any kind of cryptocurrency, the answer isn\'t simple: It depends, as their values fluctuate quickly and widely. Take for example, bitcoin, which reached its current all-time high of $1,242 per coin in November 2013, whereas each BTC was worth only around $200 a few months before that. As of this writing, bitcoin\'s value is back to $210, and who knows if it\'ll ever be worth more than $1K apiece ever again. Point is, if you plan on investing your life savings on bitcoin or any other alternative, you\'ll have to study it closely and prepare for the consequences. Instead of getting your kids\' college tuition or your retirement fund when you\'re ready to liquidate, you might end up with but a fraction of what you originally invested.\n\nStill want some first-hand experience with these crypto-coins anyway? We put together some basic info you should know before getting started, using bitcoin as the reference currency.\n\nHOW TO GET CRYPTOCURRENCY\n\nThese are some of the most common ways to get bitcoins or any of its alternatives:\n\nYou can use one of the many exchange services that buy and sell BTC for US dollars/whatever your local currency is. This is obviously the easiest way to get started, as all you need to do is choose among one of the many options available. Some money changers are pretty strict and will ask for a copy of your ID and proof of address, but that\'s still easier than the other two ways below.\n\nThis is obviously the easiest way to get started, as all you need to do is choose among one of the many options available. Some money changers are pretty strict and will ask for a copy of your ID and proof of address, but that\'s still easier than the other two ways below. You can sell goods and services through bitcoin marketplaces. A quick Google search will point you to online buy-and-sell websites that accept or specifically ask for bitcoins for transactions.\n\nA quick Google search will point you to online buy-and-sell websites that accept or specifically ask for bitcoins for transactions. Finally, you can ""mine"" for bitcoins. This one isn\'t something we\'d recommend if you\'re new to cryptocurrency, as you\'d need specialized hardware (ASIC miners, in particular, which are USB-powered devices that don\'t do anything else) to do it for you. ""Mining"" is the process of verifying transactions and adding them to the public ledger or the block chain, in bitcoin\'s case. In addition, it\'s the only way to introduce new bitcoins into the circulation, as miners are rewarded for every block of transactions they process.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, cryptocurrencies aren\'t regulated by any institution, so there\'s no bank that would print more money when the need arises. Take note, though, that the system makes it harder to mine the more blocks of transactions are processed. The rewards were also designed to be cut in half every four years to prevent inflation and to keep the total number of bitcoins in circulation to 21 million at most. At the moment, the reward for each block mined is 25 BTC, and the process has become difficult to the point that you\'ll now have to join a mining pool if you actually want to earn anything. A mining pool combines the resources of a group of people to mine bitcoins and divides the loot amongst the members.\n\nSound complicated? Well, mining isn\'t exactly a simple concept. Watch the video above first, then let\'s try to visualize the idea: Imagine that you\'re an actual miner with a pickaxe in your hand, and there\'s a big boulder in front of you with golden coins hidden in its very center. To get to the gold coins, you\'ll have to chip away at the boulder: The better your equipment is, the faster you can go. Unfortunately, you\'re not the only one trying to get to the center of the boulder, and it\'s a race between you and other miners with better, more high-tech pickaxes. That\'s why the best way is to pal up with other people to get to the very center of the boulder and divide the loot. As time goes by, though, you\'ll notice that boulders become harder to break and the gold coins in the center become fewer in number.\n\nThat\'s but an oversimplification of the process, of course, but it should give you an idea of how it works. The boulder in this case represents a block or a big bunch of transactions miners have to verify and solve. Each piece of rock a miner chips away represents a verified transaction, and the gold coins represent the bitcoins a miner can earn and introduce into the circulation.\n\nWHERE TO STORE CRYPTOCURRENCY\n\nBefore you exchange your hard-earned dollars or mine for some BTC, though, you\'ll first need a wallet to keep your virtual money in. Within these wallets, you\'ll find your secret codes or keys needed to be able to spend your coins, as well as an address (which functions similar to a PayPal email, except it\'s a long code of letters and numbers) that you need to give people sending you money. Some wallets can even generate several addresses so you can give a different one to every person you\'re transacting with as an extra precaution.\n\nThere are many types of bitcoin wallets, including desktop programs and mobile apps, which are ideal if you want to pay for purchases in brick-and-mortar stores. Some of them can be accessed online, but in case you end up with an inordinately large amount of bitcoins, you\'re likely better off keeping most of it offline in what\'s known as ""cold storage."" While bitcoins stored online are more easily accessible, everything stored offline is much safer. When exchange service Bitstamp was hacked in early January, the thieves got away with ""only"" $5 million, because most of the company\'s reserves were stored offline.\n\nWe kept saying earlier that bitcoins don\'t have a physical form -- well that\'s still true, but in addition to apps, programs and online services, another way to store the cryptocurrency is through ""paper wallets."" There are businesses that will print your address and private key as QR codes on a card. Want something fancier than a paper card? A website called Casascius sells actual physical bitcoins (which you can see in the top image) with your address and private key hidden underneath a hologram. They used to come loaded with spendable BTC, but after being questioned by the feds, the owner has decided to sell them empty -- you\'ll have to find a way to load the coin on your own.\n\nFor those who think paper and flashy coin wallets are too risky, there are special hardware wallets that promise to keep your money secure while also being easier to access, such as that prototype bracelet by MEVU. Some physical wallets even take on an unusual form, like a CD or a vinyl encoded with private keys as audio files.\n\nSECURITY BREACHES AND CONTROVERSIES\n\nSince cryptocurrencies aren\'t governed by an institution -- there\'s a Bitcoin Foundation, but it merely promotes the currency\'s use and doesn\'t function like a bank -- they\'ve become ideal for transactions that, well, aren\'t exactly legal. As we\'ve mentioned earlier, bitcoin is the online black market\'s preferred method of payment, including drug and gun transactions, among other items. Prominent black market website and marketplace ""The Silk Road"" had $25 million worth of bitcoins seized by the US government during a raid back in 2013. The government ended up auctioning 50,000 BTC from what was confiscated. A bitcoin exchange executive and foundation member was even sentenced to two years behind bars for helping run an underground dollar-to-BTC operation for Silk Road regulars.\n\nAlso, because exchange services keep part of their reserve in online wallets, quite a few companies were hacked in the past year. One of the most high-profile bitcoin-related security breaches happened to Japan-based exchange company Mt. Gox, which lost 850,000 BTC and ultimately had to shut down. According to the latest info from authorities in Tokyo, it could have been an inside job. Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles has recently been accused of being Silk Road\'s mastermind who hid behind the name Dread Pirate Roberts, something that he categorically denied.\n\nSpeaking of naming people as the face behind pseudonyms, Newsweek published a piece in 2014, pinpointing Japanese-American and California-native Dorian Nakamoto as the Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto also denied being bitcoin\'s creator and even raised a legal defense fund to sue the publication as the publicity has apparently caused a major inconvenience and hurt his family.\n\nWant to know more? We have a more in-depth piece about bitcoin, if you\'d like to dig deeper into currency and the technology behind it.', 'Today I want to consider the outlook for bitcoin.\n\n2014 was its worst year on record.\n\nIt fell by 67%, from $800 to $320 a coin. In doing so, it beat the likes of the Russian rouble and the Ukrainian hryvnia, to the dubious honour of being the world’s worst-performing currency.\n\nYou know what the world’s best-performing currency was by the way? Nope, not the US dollar, but the Somali shilling. Yup. It surprised me too.\n\nAnyway, back to bitcoin…\n\nThe bursting of the bitcoin bubble\n\nSo far, 2015 has not been any better than 2014 for bitcoin. At one stage last week, bitcoin had fallen by another 47% to $170, though the price has since rallied to around $210.\n\nGiven that I’ve just written a book on the subject, you might expect me to be uber-bullish. But I’m not. I’m bullish on the tech. The tech is amazing. It’s going to change the way we operate.\n\nBut the price of a bitcoin? That’s a different matter.\n\nIn November 2013, one bitcoin cost the same as an ounce of gold – $1,240. It had risen by over 1,000% in just a few weeks. Every Tom, Dick and Harry was starting up his own currency. There was talk of bitcoin replacing the US dollar and eradicating poverty.\n\nIt bore no resemblance to what was going on in the real world. Few people were actually using bitcoins to buy stuff – which is what money is for. Bitcoin had become a speculative asset.\n\nI do think that bitcoin, or one of its off-shoots, will eventually become the global standard for online transactions. And I think it will have a role to play in bringing unbanked people in developing markets into global commerce.\n\nBut we are many years away from that. The bitcoin price at the end of 2013 suggested it was going to happen tomorrow, when the reality was that it had barely a couple of a million users. Read this Money Morning I wrote at the time. It shows how hysterical things had become.\n\nCast your mind back to the most famous bubble of recent times. I’m not talking about London property – that bubble never burst – but about dotcom stocks in 2000.\n\nComputers were slow. Most of us were still using dial-up modems. The internet had just 361 million users (5% of the world’s population).\n\nNow, almost everybody in the developed world has fast computers and broadband, and the internet has three billion users – around half the world’s adult population. And yet the Nasdaq, where most tech companies are listed, is trading 10% lower than it was then.\n\nThat’s because, even although the Nasdaq was ‘right’ – the internet did change the world – by 2000 the prices of stocks listed on the Nasdaq bore no relation to what those companies were actually doing in the real world. It was a bubble.\n\nSomething similar, but smaller, has happened with bitcoin. And bubbles take some time to get over.\n\nThere’s a long, slow road ahead for bitcoin\n\nBut just as internet usage grew in the real world post-2000, so is bitcoin adoption. The number of bitcoin wallets grew from 3.2 million at the start of 2014, to eight million by year-end, according to Coindesk’s latest State of Bitcoin report. By the end of 2015, that’s expected to rise to 12 million.\n\nOf course, given that most users have more than one wallet, you’re still talking about less than five million users.\n\nThe number of merchants accepting bitcoin rose from 36,000 to 82,000, with 140,000 forecast for 2015. Even Microsoft is now accepting bitcoin, as well as the likes of Dell and Time. Again, that is a positive development – but what proportion of these merchants’ trade is actually transacted in bitcoin? Pretty small I expect.\n\nAt the start of 2014 there were just four bitcoin ATMs. Now there are over 340. Another positive growth story, but compare 340 bitcoin ATMs worldwide to the number of cash ATMs.\n\nVenture capital (VC) is pouring into the sector – and it really is pouring. From $98m invested in 2013 to $335m in 2014.\n\nSilicon Valley alone is responsible for about 30% of this. Along with Hollywood and Wall Street, Silicon Valley is one of America’s three biggest brain pools. These people are not stupid. They can see beyond the falling price, beyond the fact that bitcoin is out of fashion (mainstream mentions are down by over 75%), and beyond the ridicule of last week.\n\nBut they’re betting on new companies that will make use of the tech, not necessarily that the price will rise next month. Of course, they’d prefer the price to be rising, but it isn’t essential to their agenda.\n\nBitcoin 2.0 – how the blockchain could change the world\n\nIn short, the initial excitement phase of bitcoin is over. Now it’s on the long, slow climb to mainstream adoption. In terms of price, we’re kind of where the Nasdaq was in 2001-03. It wouldn’t surprise me – as things stand for now, at least – to see $100 a coin before we see $400.\n\nBut the tech is amazing, and worth familiarising yourself with. It is known as the ‘blockchain’. I liken it to a supersonic database. The genius behind it is that it eliminates the need for third parties.\n\nWe already know that – thanks to bitcoin – you can send money from one person to another without the need for banks. But developers are now taking the tech and seeing what else it can be used for.\n\nThey’re finding new ways to communicate and socially network without third-party providers (the likes of Gmail, Apple, Facebook or Twitter). They’re finding ways to draft and enforce contracts without the need for lawyers (these are known as ‘smart contracts’). They’re finding ways to issue and trade shares – without the need for traditional stock exchanges and financiers.\n\nIt’s known as Bitcoin 2.0 and, for now, that’s where I think the fireworks will be.\n\nThe problem is, as yet, most of the companies operating in the field are still private, so it’s difficult to invest. But that gives you more time to get to grips with how bitcoin works. Here’s a reminder of my handy little guide to getting started with bitcoin.\n\n1. Go to Blockchain or Coinbase and get yourself a wallet. All you need is an email address and password. You will then be told your wallet address. Copy it.\n\n2. You now need to deposit some money. In the UK, you could go to Bittylicious. Paste your wallet address where it says “bitcoin address”. Now deposit £20 via your credit card.\n\n3. Get a friend to do the same.\n\n4. Practise sending each other small amounts of money.\n\n5. Go to a café that accepts bitcoins and buy yourself a coffee.\n\nWell done. You’re now part of the revolution.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>\n\nRead the original article on MoneyWeek. Copyright 2015. Follow MoneyWeek on Twitter.', 'Online payments leader PayPal held an introduction to bitcoin event as part of its monthly TechXploration speaker series yesterday, packing hundreds into its Town Hall auditorium in San Jose, California.\n\nAttendees gathered for a deep, yet entertaining, session on how bitcoin works, overseen by the digital payments innovator that took the industry by storm in its early days with email-based money transfers.\n\nLeading the talk was Lorne Lantz, a developer and technical contributor for Andreas Antonopoulos\' book ‘Mastering Bitcoin’.\n\nWhile known principally as a payments solution, however, Lantz told the audience that is a small part of what bitcoin\'s greater technology and potential.\n\nHe said:\n\n“Money is just the first app for bitcoin. Just like email was the first app for the Internet.”\n\nThe PayPal TechXploration event was held in part to promote the O’Reilly Bitcoin and Blockchain conference being held 27th January in San Francisco. Lantz is an organizer for the one-day affair, which will feature speakers such as Reid Hoffman of Greylock Partners, Balaji Srinivasan of Andreessen Horowitz and Andreas Antonopoulos.\n\nPositives and negatives\n\nThe presentation began with Lantz playing a video of various media clips often falsely portraying bitcoin, including one of famed investor Warren Buffet saying bitcoin is ""a mirage, basically"".\n\nHow bitcoin transactions are confirmed and how cryptography plays a part were important aspects discussed during the session.\n\nThe presentation also dived deep into bitcoin’s open-sourced ledger.\n\nLantz said:\n\n“The power behind bitcoin is the blockchain.”\n\nHe did not gloss over the fact that bitcoin has its drawbacks, though he did promote bitcoin as a great merchant tool that has lower fees and cash-like properties.\n\nLantz went on to note that although bitcoin could be a great tool for the unbanked, there are fewer consumer protections.\n\nPayPal and bitcoin\n\nAs a company always keeping close watch the on digital payments industry, PayPal has already integrated online bitcoin payments via its Payments Hub.\n\nThat PayPal offers educational content on bitcoin could perhaps be indicative of the digital currency\'s liftoff. That Lantz said he sees bitcoin innovating online payments – PayPal’s core business – is a promising indicator for enthusiasts of bitcoin and its wider adoption.\n\n“Online is actually taking off. It’s got some nice traction,” he said.\n\nHowever, Lantz added:\n\n“There’s a series of things that add up making it difficult for merchants to accept bitcoin offline.”\n\nOne of the big problems Lantz pointed out was the often difficult integration of bitcoin into the existing point-of-sale systems used by bricks-and-mortar businesses.\n\nImages via Dan Cawrey for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitspark coordinates with its Indonesian partner, Artabit, which enables the recipient to collect Indonesian rupiah from a bank or post office within 24 hours.\n\nThe process allows customers to deposit and withdraw cash, without touching bitcoin, while Bitspark and Artabit transact in the cryptocurrency. In the Philippines, Bitspark works with bitcoin exchange Rebit.\n\nBitspark co-founder George Harrap said:\n\n""We can now do same-day transfers in Indonesian rupiah to the other end.""\n\nDiversifying the customer pool\n\nThe firm has moved to charging a flat fee for remittances instead of the 1% cut it levied for transfers to the Philippines last month. Customers sending funds to Indonesia pay HK$25 (US$3.22), while those making transfers to the Philippines pay HK$15 (US$1.93).\n\nEven as the firm expands its remittance reach, it\'s also diversifying its pool of customers.\n\nHarrap says that his firm is now transferring more money for companies instead of individuals. Employment agencies for foreign labour in Hong Kong, for example, remit funds to their home countries regularly to meet overhead expenses there.\n\n""Employment agencies will often have an office in the Philippines where they source many of the candidates. They have bills to pay in the Philippines,"" Harrap said.\n\nBitspark is currently completing 10 to 20 transfers a day, according to Harrap, and volume has been doubling every week. Business customers are driving the higher volume, Harrap says, because they typically remit funds fortnightly compared to monthly remittances by individuals.\n\nTraditional fiat currency remittances to Indonesia from Singapore cost 5% of the transferred amount on average, rising to as high as 10% of funds, according to the World Bank. The World Bank doesn\'t track the cost of funds sent from Hong Kong, but the Singapore-Indonesia corridor is comparable.\n\nUnscathed by bitcoin price crash\n\nBitcoin\'s crashing price hasn\'t triggered any losses for Bitspark, Harrap said, although he declined to state his firm\'s methods for insulating its funds from bitcoin\'s price volatility.\n\nHe said only that he didn\'t necessarily exchange remitted funds for bitcoin immediately, and that he had figured out a ""better"" method.\n\nHarrap is among those who are trying to exploit bitcoin\'s potential as a means for cross-border transfers rather than its properties as a speculative financial asset.\n\nHe said:\n\n""For our remittance service we don\'t care if the price is $1 or $1m. Bitcoin is the means of transmission. We\'re getting the message across that bitcoin has real-world applications besides speculation.""\n\nIndonesia image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Gox heist and the incessant security threats testing the Bitcoin space, more and more exchanges (Bitstamp, Huobi, etc.) are increasingly implementing multisignature security in their wallets. The addition promises greater protection of funds by removing centralized points of failure due to the traditional custodial account model.\n\nOne of the companies at the forefront of this trend is Cryptosigma, a Singapore-based multisignature digital wallet provider. Cryptosigma has partnered with Venice-based Bitcoin API developer Gem, which recently held a US$2M funding round and onboarded former PayPal executive, Ken Miller (COO), whom we recently interviewed.\n\nBitcoin certainly suffers from an image problem and, arguably, two of the biggest issues contributing to this are security and price volatility, which are slowing adoption and hampering consumer confidence in the new technology.\n\nCoinTelegraph had the chance to sit down with Ken Miller and Cryptosigma founder and CEO, Aaron Siwoku, to discuss the pressing issue of securing customer funds, as well as Cryptosigma’s unique in-wallet auto-conversion feature, which may remove the volatility from the equation and do for the average consumer what BitPay did for merchants.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Are the much-discussed hacks and thefts that we hear so much about in the media, such as Mt. Gox, the direct result of their centralized, custodial account structure? Could you elaborate on this?\n\nKen Miller: The beauty of multisig is that when implemented appropriately, it actually provides much better security than the historical custodial account model, which is basically just a password-protection model that can easily be hacked. With multisig, instances like Mt. Gox would never happen because even if the exchange's online key is hacked, they still would need the co-signing key of the 3rd-party multisig provider. Alternatively, if the 3rd party multisig provider's co-signing key is hacked, funds cannot be touched because the exchange's keys are still needed.\n\n“The beauty of multisig is that when implemented appropriately, it actually provides much better security than the historical custodial account model.” —Ken Miller\n\nAaron Siwoku: One of the big issues that I think entrepreneurs and developers in the wallet and/or exchange space need to address is the custodial control of users’ funds. The beautiful thing about Bitcoin is that it’s decentralized money, and the moment we centralize user accounts and funds through the custodial control of their wallet addresses (private keys), rather than give each user the responsibility to control their own private keys, is the moment we cannot distinguish ourselves from the centralized banking model that has existed for centuries.\n\nCT: What is the best way to overcome this problem?\n\nKM: It can be solved by exchanges, wallet providers, payment processors, and others in the ecosystem migrating away from custodial models to noncustodial 2-of-3 multisig models, where hackers gaining access to a single online key cannot do anything with that key. As organizations migrate their platform to (or launch from the beginning with) noncustodial multisig solutions, those that remain with custodial wallets will have an even bigger target on them as they become the minority.\n\nAS: In terms of solving the problem I think that apart from the very juicy incentive for hackers to compromise a Bitcoin exchange’s centralized operational wallet or “hot wallet,” knowing that they're likely to find a large amount of funds in one place, we as the community lose the ability to distinguish ourselves from the legacy system that currently exists. It’s a lose-lose situation. The very fact that Bitcoin is decentralized programmable money affords us some unique advantages; namely increased security and theft protection based on the fact that if a hacker cannot be sure he will find a large cache of funds in one place such as an exchange’s centralized “hot wallet,” he is less incentivized to risk getting caught for a potentially small pay day.\n\n“When we see the migration of exchanges […] to the implementation of non-custodial user wallets, [coupled] with the implementation of multisig wallets, […] over time we will see a mind-numbing reduction in the percentage of wallet funds that are compromised each year.” —Aaron Siwoku\n\nWhen we see the migration of exchanges currently operating a custodial system to the implementation of noncustodial user wallets where each user is responsible for their own private key, and we can couple that with the implementation of multisig wallets that have some rules-based systems that can identify unusual spending patterns and become more artificially intelligently accustomed to a user’s spending behavior, over time we will see a mind numbing reduction in the percentage of wallet funds that are compromised each year. It’s a little bit like all the large amount of credit card fraud that was happening before SSL certificates were implemented as a standard for online shopping portals. These are normal growing pains but the sooner we move past them the better.\n\nCT: Do you see a future for the traditional custodial-exchange model?\n\nAS: I think that there will always be custodial models, whether it’s in Bitcoin or anything else. This issue being that, as a society, due to a historic lack of technological democracy, we have all become very accustomed to the concept that, in order to truly secure something, it must be done by a third party who has more technology and expertise than us and [that] it’s worth paying them a fee to do so.\n\n“[In] the 21st century, technology is becoming more democratic than ever before, and so money should hopefully follow too.” —Aaron Siwoku\n\nBut in the 21st century, technology is becoming more democratic than ever before, and so money should hopefully follow too. The second issue is that, regardless of anything, there is always going to be a group of people who don't convert immediately, or at all, to a new technology or way of doing something, for their own very specific reasons. I have a close friend my age who still refuses to use social media, but then my best friend’s 81-year-old grandad has an iPad. My point is [that] nothing ever really ceases to exist, but real problems find real solutions because the market is intuitive.\n\nCT: The multisig approach requires a bit more responsibility from the user. Do you think people will eventually warm to the idea of “being their own bank”?\n\nKM: For sure they will. If you go back to the prebank era, people were quite used to (and comfortable with) holding their own funds. They would store and carry money, and had total autonomy over who was in control of their money. There were two issues at the time, however: (1) security and (2) access. With security, theft became an issue with people frequently transporting funds to and from their homes. With access, the issue was [that], if you were in another town visiting family or buying something, not having access to your funds was a problem.\n\n“With Bitcoin, neither security, nor access needs to be a problem. Multisig platforms are arguably even safer than traditional bank platforms, and the beauty of Bitcoin is the accessibility anywhere in the world.” —Ken Miller\n\nSo banks showed up to help solve those issues. But with Bitcoin, neither security, nor access needs to be a problem. Multisig platforms are arguably even safer than traditional bank platforms, and the beauty of Bitcoin is the accessibility anywhere in the world, particularly as mobile apps develop. So as those issues get addressed, and security and access become commonplace in Bitcoin, I think we'll see that people by and large would prefer to return to the model where they are in control and responsible for their own funds.\n\nCT: Could you explain how your multisig feature works in practice, what role does your partner Gem play, and where the keys are stored?\n\nAS: When we launch, we will use an operational wallet from Gem that uses multisignature transaction signing, meaning should our hot wallet get compromised, it’s easy for us to stop signing transactions and move the funds without having to take the exchange offline for a few days while we secure the platform, as we recently saw happen with a popular Bitcoin exchange in Europe.\n\nIn addition to this, we have a rules engine that controls daily transaction volume limits and how much funds can leave our account over any given time period. Let’s say our normal 24-hour volume over the space of a month is US$1million in bitcoin. Our rules engine could be set to stop signing transactions and request authorization from someone in our team, if all of the sudden there was a spike in the hourly volume that did not fit with historical transaction volume activity. This makes it more difficult for a bad actor to move an unusual amount of funds out of the wallet in a short space of time without the system disabling itself and waiting for one of our team members to verify everything is normal.\n\nCT: Besides multisig security, you’re also offering an auto-conversion feature that removes volatility from the equation, which essentially makes you similar to processors like BitPay, albeit with a B2C approach. How does this work exactly, and do you envision a future where Bitcoin could possibly work under the hood?\n\nAS: I speak to a lot of non-Bitcoin people about Bitcoin, and the most common issue that crops up other than “what is it?” would always be “I saw the bitcoin price went from US$1,000 to $200. ... Why would I use something that will lose me money?” It’s a very legit issue, and I think sometimes hardcore Bitcoin adopters just answer this type of question with, “Well it’s a liquidity issue because Bitcoin is so new, but that will change in the future so just hold tight!” Sadly and understandably people aren't interested in what they can use in five years. People want real solutions for real problems that exist today!\n\n“As there was no consumer wallet in the market offering instant conversion to fiat currency, the same way Bitpay offers [to] its merchants, we decided it would be us.” —Aaron Siwoku\n\nI felt that this issue was a big one standing in the way of adoption and I saw large merchant payment processors like Bitpay offering instant bitcoin-to-fiat currency conversion in order to attract large merchants like Expedia and Microsoft who have no current real-world use for Bitcoin. They can’t pay staff in bitcoin, or rent or taxes ... yet. But they wanted to use bitcoin as a low cost, instant way to process transactions!\n\nConsumers are no different. We can’t easily pay for the common things in BTC, such as grocery shopping, electricity bills, [or] rent, but we do want a cheaper and instant way to remit and receive money. As there was no consumer wallet in the market offering instant conversion to fiat currency, the same way Bitpay offers [to] its merchants, we decided it would be us, and we came up with the Auto Exchange toggle function that you will find in our web wallet platform and in our soon-to-be launched iPhone app.\n\nCT: With Bitcoin known to have public image issues, can auto-conversion help it gain traction?\n\nAS: I think auto conversion that works in both directions (send and receive)—meaning a user’s wallet will convert any bitcoin they receive to their currency of choice—if the Auto Exchange function is toggled on. In addition, if I want to pay for something in bitcoin, the Cryptosigma wallet will just convert the exact amount of bitcoin necessary for that transaction. I think this will definitely help Bitcoin gain traction because it helps people use bitcoin early on as a remittance or payment protocol without having to worry about what happens if the price moves downwards 10 minutes after they receive their bitcoins, and perhaps haven't had time to log in to the exchange and sell their bitcoins for local currency.\n\nEventually when Bitcoin becomes more widely accepted and the price stabilizes, people will already be familiar with Bitcoin as the thing that has allowed them to remit money instantly and cheaply over the last few years. This creates confidence in the system. Throw into the mix the fact that the supermarket, electricity provider and petrol station now all may potentially accept bitcoin as a payment method, users no longer need to lose transaction fees selling in and out of bitcoin to fiat currency, saving even more money on fees than they were when they first swapped banking remittance for bitcoin remittance.\n\nCT: How do the fees compare when using Cryptosigma, in contrast to legacy money transfer networks?\n\nAS: Legacy money transfer networks charge anything from 3.5% to 10.5% to send money. (There are some banks who do free money transfer, but their currency exchange rates will be less than favorable.) If we look at a typical use case scenario—let’s say a Cryptosigma user already has deposited funds to his or her account in the same way you would already have funds in your bank account to remit—then this would be how a remittance between two Cryptosigma users with Auto Exchange toggled on would look:\n\nUser A wishes to send US$100 to User B. For this example, we are assuming the user sends or receives more than 20 BTC per month in transaction volume and so transaction fees are 0.1%. If the user sends or receives less than 5 BTC per month, the transaction fees would be 0.5%. We also assume it is a standard bitcoin transaction, not a priority send, which costs more in miners’ fees. Slippage has also not been accounted for, but I still feel this is a good example highlighting the rough transaction cost:\n\nUser A types US$100 into her Bitcoin wallet app on the “send money” page and clicks send. The app auto buys US$100 worth of bitcoins at market price from the bitcoin open-order book and sends it to User B (with a 0.1% transaction fee + US$0.03 miners fee). User B's wallet receives the US$100 worth of bitcoin and auto-sells it at market price on behalf of User B (0.1% transaction fee + US$0.03 miners fee), which is then instantly reflected in his account balance, minus the fees (0.1% + 0.1% + US$0.06). User B's wallet shows a balance of US$99.92 (US$100 - US$0.08 in transaction fees).\n\nThis saves between 3 and 10%, versus legacy money remittance providers or banks.\n\nCT: Could you explain the functionality and underlying costs of your Visa-Bitcoin debit card?\n\nAS: The debit card is still a tool that involves legacy payment networks such as banks, traditional merchant payment processing and ATMs; therefore, there are still fees involved. We don't profit on these fees, we simply pass them on as they are. The debit card is something we felt would be a useful tool to combine together with Bitcoin, giving people the option to use something we are all familiar with, while at the same time promoting the use of Bitcoin as an effective way to instantly load that card with funds, as and when the user wishes. As Bitcoin gains adoption, we hope to see people use the card less and the wallet app more for day-to-day payments and spending. The debit card fees are as follows:\n\nCard issuing fee - US$15\n\nPurchase transaction - free\n\nATM transaction - US$2.50\n\nATM transaction international - US$3.50\n\nCard-to-card transfer - US$0.25\n\nCT: Finally, the Cryptosigma approach seems a bit more gradual and more in tune with the financial tools that average people have become accustomed to, such as fiat currency units and debit cards. Could you explain why you chose this strategy?\n\nAS: We chose this strategy because we think it’s important to use Bitcoin and the blockchain technology to solve real-world problems today, not problems we feel may exist five years from now when the existing remittance model from legacy payment networks is no longer sustainable, or an existing currency system may need a more democratic, viable alternative.\n\n“People are not familiar with Bitcoin as a unit of value yet. […] The smartest way to do that, we believe, is to give people a transparent, easy and enjoyable platform to remit currency units they currently use, such as dollars, peso, baht.”\n\nPeople are not familiar with Bitcoin as a unit of value yet, and we are interested in bridging that gap. The smartest way to do that, we believe, is to give people a transparent, easy and enjoyable platform to remit currency units they currently use, such as dollars, peso, baht and eventually pounds, euros and shillings, but in a cheaper more effective way through the technological breakthrough that is the blockchain. When the market is ready to use digital currency in more complex formats, such as peer-to-peer loans or interest paid on fixed deposits per minute, instead of by the month, we will be there to provide that functionality.\n\nCT: When can we expect to see Cryptosigma go live?\n\nAS: If you haven't signed up for an early-access invitation to be part of our private beta launch, then now is the time to do it at www.cryptosigma.com! We are giving away a limited number of early-access invites and each invited user will receive US$10 in their account to play with, buy some bitcoin, send it or spend it. We really want you to explore our platform and give us lots of feedback. We plan to move into open beta in March, at which point anyone anywhere will be able sign up for a Cryptosigma bitcoin wallet.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

However, benefits of bitcoin over traditional forms of payment including significantly lower transaction fees, absence of chargebacks, and no intermediaries are difficult, if not impossible to underestimate.\n\nMostly unregulated, digital currency is subject to hot debate among businesses, politicians, financial institutions, and regulators around the globe. The decentralised nature of bitcoin poses many fundamental questions relating to how digital money should work in the world of traditional currency regulations. Many see that the current regulatory regime does not reflect the disruptive nature of bitcoin.\n\nDSX has chosen to take an alternative approach by drawing parallels between e-money as an established and regulated product and digital currency.\n\nThe DSX team, led by Mike Rymanov, as CEO, established Digital Securities Exchange (DSX) using the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 principles at its core. In order for DSX to stay compliant it was registered as an agent with the FCA regulated company ePayments Systems Ltd (ePayments). This simple, yet very effective move, produced something entirely unique – by running all transactions via ePayments, DSX forced bitcoin into the regulated environment.\n\n“We strongly believe that we are on the verge of drastic changes to the way people are paying and getting paid. When using digital currency, individuals and businesses should be confident that priorities are placed on safety and accessibility of funds. Regulations are there to make sure that these priorities are always met”, says Mike Rymanov.\n\nSimilar to traditional regulated financial institutions, the DSX association with ePayments guarantees that all traders are subject to comprehensive customer due diligence procedures and AML checks. Furthermore, all traders’ funds are kept in segregated, and ring-fenced, clients’ funds e-money accounts ensuring its safety.\n\nDSX is a natural stepping-stone towards creating a true hybrid e-money/digital currency trading and payments platform. Based on a tried and tested regulatory regime, yet embracing new technology, Digital Securities Exchange is set to change the world – one bitcoin at a time.\n\nDSX website: dsx.uk\n\nNotes for Editors:\n\nePayments Systems is run by that same management team behind DSX. ePayments provides a cost-effective, fast and secure way for companies and individuals to make and receive payments across international borders. ePayments is regulated by the FCA. www.epayments.com\n\n[END]', 'Bitcoins have been subject to major fluctuations, causing some investors to smile and others to frown. (Getty Images)\n\nIf you timed it right – and that’s a big if – you bought a single bitcoin for $13.30 on New Year’s Day 2013 and sold that slice of digital currency for about $1,150, less than a year later, on Dec. 4. That’s more than 86 times the original investment. Wow.\n\nIf you timed it wrong, you invested that same day and saw the value plummet more than half by Dec. 22, only 18 days later. Ouch.\n\nAssuming you held that bitcoin longer, from October 2013 ($100) to mid-January 2015, you’d have doubled your money. But you’d also be biting your nails, as the currency has dropped more than 30 percent between Jan. 1 and Jan. 15, when the price hit $207.\n\nSo is now a good time to buy bitcoins? Or is it ever a good time to invest in them? Financial experts from all corners of the traditional investment field answer with a resounding “no,” while digital entrepreneurs and their ilk say “yes,” often to the point of bullishness. Throughout 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission kept a close watch on bitcoin activity. In May, it issued a warning that ""the rise of bitcoin and other virtual and digital currencies creates new concerns for investors. A new product, technology, or innovation – such as bitcoin – has the potential to give rise both to frauds and high-risk investment opportunities.""\n\n“I’d never recommend anyone ‘invest’ in bitcoins,” says Jeff Reeves, editor of InvestorPlace.com and author of “The Frugal Investor’s Guide to Finding Great Stocks.” “It’s barely even a functional currency, let alone an investment vehicle, and the risks of volatility are enormous. It’s a quirky little tech phenomenon, not an investment or asset class.”\n\n“A bitcoin has no intrinsic value,” adds Greg McBride, senior vice president and chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. “There’s no underlying asset from which a bitcoin’s value is derived. Rather, the price is based on the ‘greater fool’ theory. In other words, that someone else in the future will pay more than you did today.”\n\nBitcoins are a decentralized digital currency that launched in 2009. No government or central bank backs it, nor is its creator known (his alias is Satoshi Nakamoto). Bitcoins have also made headlines not simply for their wild fluctuations, but also because they are nearly impossible to trace, making them a favorite of thieves and drug dealers.\n\nIf they’re stolen via computer hack, good luck, says Kim Caughey Forrest, vice president and senior analyst of portfolio management at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “There are rules about what happens if someone breaks into the bank and steals and how the account owners are compensated. That is missing from the bitcoin world.”\n\nShe also notes, “We would never tell a client to buy bitcoins as an investment. How can I ever tell if a bitcoin is over, under or fairly valued? I can’t. Neither can anyone else. This is what makes an investment. Otherwise, it’s a lottery ticket.""\n\nThat said, you may be able to buy lottery tickets with bitcoins in the future. Online retailers such as TigerDirect and Overstock.com, along with the Sacramento Kings, accept the currency. You can even make donations with them at nonprofits, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and higher-education institutions, including the University of Puget Sound.\n\nMeanwhile, the Digerati have embraced bitcoins as a sophisticated method of making financial transactions and currency investments.\n\n“I think the price is getting close to being extremely attractive,” says Vadim Telyatnikov, CEO of AlphaPoint, a New York-based digital currency exchange platform that supports bitcoin. “But I wouldn’t invest quite yet, as I believe the price may continue to decline in the short term.”\n\nHe adds, “It’s possible to intelligently predict how bitcoin will perform long term” using a “simple moving average” calculated by adding closing prices of the previous 200 days, and then dividing by 200. “That result is plotted on a chart and updated every day, so that a trend upward or downward can be identified,” Telyatnikov says.\n\nBut what of the recent steep price drops? It may sound hard to believe, but some see a silver (or bitcoin) lining.\n\n“With such extreme instability, we knew the results would be surprising, and we weren’t disappointed,” says Mike Kane, CEO and co-founder of Hedgeable, a digital wealth manager that can invest retail clients directly in bitcoin. “Most bitcoin insiders are still bullish despite the massive amount of negativity.” Based on Hedgeable’s survey of five groups, from media members to venture capitalists and angel investors, he forecasts bitcoins hitting all-time highs in three years, which would put it over the $1,150 mark.\n\nAlthough bitcoins are possibly in a “buy low” mode now, or headed there, daring investors may want to take the same approach as smart gamblers in Vegas: Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.\n\nMark Williams, who teaches finance at the Boston University School of Management and is a former bank examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank, advises bitcoin buyers to beware. “If investors, after understanding the extreme price risk, still want to invest in bitcoin, they should only commit amounts that, if lost, won\'t impact their livelihood,” Williams says.']"
01/22/2015,"['The World Economic Forum in Davos is the new Time magazine of conferences, influential but always late to the party. If something was edgy, pressing or groundbreaking years ago, Davos is on it now. In 2013, our prophets of profits tackled systemic risk in complex, interconnected systems. Last year, the Masters of the Universe got hip to climate change. This year, they’re talking about Bitcoin. On tap for next year? Macklemore.\n\nLast year at Davos, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew derided Bitcoin as a shady currency for undesirable cyber punks. This year, LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman is singing the virtual currency’s praises to attendees. Hoffman thinks that Bitcoin might be a nice thing for poorer areas of the world where people lack access to traditional banking. It’s a nice thought, especially if you’ve ever traded U.S. dollars for bundled stacks of Nigerian Naira by the side of a muddy road in Port Harcourt, choosing your exchange rate from the dozens of calculators shoved in your face by entrepreneurial money changers. But it’s also not a nice thought because Bitcoin prices are insanely volatile.\n\nFace it, if Bitcoin is a currency, it is a basket case. Bitcoins traded at over $800 at the start of 2014 and then lost more than half their value, ending the year near $200 per. In January, Bitcoin crashed again, hitting a low of $173, only to bounce back to $232.18, a 35% gain that we may be able to attribute to Davos buzz, oil prices or the European Central Bank’s plan to bring much needed stimulus to the economically struggling euro zone. Since Hoffman’s comments, Bitcoin is up about $20 overnight, anyway.\n\nOr maybe Bitcoin prices recovered for none of those reasons.\n\nThere are no fundamentals at work here. Bitcoin is purely a play on sentiment. Its price is not a measure of worth so much as it is a measure of popularity.\n\nHoffman’s idea sounds sweet and techno-Utopian, but the last thing that the poor unbanked people of the world need is to transact in a currency where the only store of value is the enthusiasm of its adherents to convert their dollars. These people will be using Bitcoins to purchase goods that are based on commodities that are priced (most often) in U.S. dollars. During a year like 2014, unbanked savers relying on Bitcoin will become new age Milton Friedmans, declaring that “inflation is always and everywhere and internet phenomenon.”\n\nBitcoin is for speculators—for people with the inclination to try to time and ups and downs and the money to lose if things go badly. For talented chartists there is probably a lot of money to be made, even during a Bitcoin bear market. Already, people have devised ways to sell Bitcoins short. A long talked-about Bitcoin ETF awaits launch and if that happens, people will be able to buy long, sell short and probably write or purchase options. Some people will be good at this game, most will be bad at it and investors are better off sticking to currencies, commodities, stocks and bonds that have intrinsic value.\n\nBy intrinsic value, I mean a bondholder’s contractual right to a cash payment outside of bankruptcy or a stockholder’s claim on corporate assets free and clear of debt. I even mean the claim that an owner of U.S. dollars can make on the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. That’s a controversial claim among Bitcoin lovers and those obsessed with gold. They criticize the dollar as a fiat currency backed by not much more than words and the largesse of the Federal Reserve. But this ignores the world around us.\n\nThe U.S. government is in debt, yes. But its debts fuel global consumption and spur global production. With its borrowed money, the U.S. has also built a gigantic, far-reaching military machine that, among other things, makes global commerce possible. The faith and credit of the U.S. government has intrinsic value because the U.S. plays a practical, important and vital role in making the economy work. As for the debt, you can’t judge a country just by the disparity between its revenue take and it’s spending. The U.S. has hundreds of trillions of dollars’ worth of assets. In 2013, the Institute for Energy Research valued just the recoverable energy assets of the country at $128 trillion. In the face of all that, the dollar seems to have much greater intrinsic value than a sentiment-driven digital currency.\n\nReid Hoffman is wrong. What poor people without banking systems need are decent banking systems, free of corruption, run in the public’s interest. Volatile Bitcoin is a ticket to Zimbabwe-style hyper-inflation at worst and, at best, a cycle of booms and busts fueled by anonymous traders accountable to no one.\n\nLeave it to the soothsayers of Davos to be talking about Bitcoin now (so 2013) when just the other day the Swiss Franc shocked the world economy.', ""Jan 22. 2015 for BitcoinMagazine.com\n\nThose within the industry understand that one of Bitcoin's most important features—and perhaps its true core innovation—is its decentralized structure.\n\nBitcoin has no central control: no central repository of information, no central management, and, crucially, no central point of failure. And yet, most of the actual services and businesses built within the Bitcoin ecosystem are centralized. They are run by specific people, in specific locations, with specific computer systems, and they are susceptible to specific legal entanglements.\n\nThis situation creates tension and certainly a little irony—we have a decentralized technology, yet most things existing upon it are centralized.\n\nTo a casual observer, and even more to a cynical one, it may appear that the claim of Bitcoin's decentralization is a myth—an overstated feature conjured up as a bullet point in Bitcoin's marketing brochure, but suspiciously not apparent in the actual product.\n\nConsider the structure of CoinBase, which is arguably the most successful Bitcoin wallet and payment service in existence. There is nothing decentralized about it.\n\nConsider CoinBase's internal policies—they resemble PayPal’s, not the distributed utopia Bitcoiners imagine. Coinbase wants to know who you are. They want to know what you're doing with your money, and they'll block you if they disapprove. They spy on you and control you as much as any traditional financial institution (and to be fair, it's not really their fault—enforcers with guns will throw them in a cage if they don't do these things; it occurs under duress).\n\nSo the question arises: How can Bitcoiners claim decentralization when the premier Bitcoin service has essentially become a bank itself?\n\nCritics point to centralized exchanges, wallets, and payment processors to condemn Bitcoin's claims of decentralization. When Mt. Gox exploded, losing half a billion dollars of customer money, critics expressed immense skepticism that Bitcoin was really anything unique at all—to them, it looked like just another new medium by which people are spied on at best, and ripped off, scammed, and defrauded at worst.\n\nSo isn't Bitcoin's claim of decentralization a lie?\n\nNo.\n\nAnd here's why: to understand Bitcoin one must understand the difference between coercive centralization and market-based centralization. Bitcoin possesses the latter, but avoids the former, and that is a crucial distinction.\n\nCoercive centralization is what we all experience in the legacy financial industry. The world's monetary system, based upon national fiat currencies created and managed by government-sponsored central banks, is coercive. It is coercive because the entities with the power over money's creation, regulation, and transfer have the will and the power to hurt you if you disobey. Not only that, but you are coerced into it in the first place, being forced to pay taxes and settle debts using only your government's anointed currency.\n\nIf you’d like to experience the coercion first-hand, try creating some dollars, and you will find yourself thrown in prison, your property taken from you. Or try transferring dollars in any way that is “unauthorized.” Then you will see what coercion means.\n\nThe entire financial system as it exists today rests upon this anti-market model of coercion—money moves only with the permission of those in control, and they're not in control by mutual contract, but by the privilege of violence. The various poisons such coercion bestows upon society are a topic for another essay, but the only reason people suffer this system is because it's been the only game in town.\n\nMarket-based centralization is fundamentally different. Its key feature is the ability to opt out.\n\nYes, CoinBase is a centralized entity. But you needn't use CoinBase to use Bitcoin. Yes, a Bitcoin exchange or web wallet is centralized, but you can always trade coins with a friend directly over the blockchain, or store it in a local wallet, without the permission of any third party.\n\nA user of fiat is always forced to utilize a centralized service. A user of Bitcoin is never forced to utilize a centralized service. This is the key distinction between centralization found in Bitcoin (which is market-based) and centralization found in the traditional banking industry (which is coercive).\n\nAnd this ability to opt out, while it may seem modest, enables wonderful things to happen, for the discipline of the marketplace can be realized. Consider: since every CoinBase user can opt out and leave the platform, this presents a natural check on CoinBase's ability to act with impropriety, and makes coercion impossible. Compare this to the model of a bank, which is able to burden its customers to a far more significant degree because it knows that if the customers want to participate in a meaningful way in the financial system, they have to use a bank and its associated fiat currency system.\n\nIt should thus be clear that Bitcoin enables users to withdraw into the neutral pasture of decentralized finance at any time, which means that any centralized service within the sphere exists only at the pleasure of its customers.\n\nAnd thus the forms of market-based centralization found within Bitcoinland needn't be feared or condemned as one would the coercive centralization of the legacy financial system. What we have is indeed something fundamentally different, which is wholly compatible with the free-market structure and intent of Bitcoin's genesis. Indeed, a free market will inevitably lead to some points of market-based centralization when economic efficiencies can be found. Every voluntary organization of people or resources is market-based centralization, and by definition, there's an inability to coerce those who partake.\n\nThe key to judging the legitimacy of centralization is always the ability of users to opt out. Bitcoin provides this, while fiat and central banks do not.\n\nThat is the difference, and it is one that the world will soon come to appreciate."", 'Today, Braintree announced that merchants in the U.S. can now accept Bitcoin via its v.zero SDK in a private beta.\n\nBraintree first announced the v.zero SDK back in July last year.

The paper proposes that if a device is registered by its manufacturer as a unique entity on the blockchain, the chain becomes in effect a massive database of device history, product revisions, firmware updates, warranties and so on.\n\nThe researchers used a Samsung W900 washing machine to demonstrate three specific case studies around servicing, consumables re-ordering, and power management.\n\nIn the first scenario, ADEPT would allow the washing machine to detect component failure, then refer to the blockchain for information on its warranty, and place a work order for an engineer to come and replace the component, all without any human interaction.\n\nIn the second scenario, the washing machine could query its peer list to determine the existence of a retail contract for detergent when it detected its own supply was running low, invoke that contract and order more detergent directly – with its owner’s permission, of course.\n\nIn the third scenario, the washing machine enters into a contractual agreement with other appliances in the home over power sharing. If it detects an upcoming peak-time spike in power pricing, it could ask the TV to power down. In IBM’s scenario, the TV refused the request because the spike was taking place during prime-time viewing. However, it compensated the washing machine with user-approved ‘tokens’ that it could then use to delay its cycle for a few hours, saving its owner money.\n\n“In such a world,” according to the paper, “we would redesign and simplify the way we design our master data management systems, after-sales systems and order processing and management. The blockchain-based, decentralised IoT can become a truly revolutionary approach to transaction processing among devices.”\n\nAcknowledging that it would be impractical to have hundreds of millions of devices all holding massive amounts of blockchain information, the paper also proposes the creation of ADEPT peers with large processing and storage capabilities, or exchanges, to manage the blockchain, possibly at a community or regional level. Smart devices would then access these peers when they needed to access their blockchains.\n\nDistributed systems like ADEPT will make our planet smarter, more efficient, and open up a huge range of economic opportunities. IBM white paper\n\nThe theorised platform would be underpinned by three open source protocols: BitTorrent for file-sharing, TeleHash for peer-to-peer messaging, and Ethereum for the blockchain technology itself.\n\nThe research team acknowledged a number of potential challenges around these platforms, noting variously that BitTorrent may lack the stability required for a decentralised IoT peer-to-peer solution, that TeleHash is still very much a work in progress, and that Ethereum blockchains are not yet scalable enough for a multibillion-node network.\n\n“Revolutions are not for the faint of heart,” the ADEPT researchers acknowledged in the paper. “There are significant challenges associated with distributed systems, not to mention issues with security, coordination, intellectual property management, identity and privacy.\n\n“We believe that distributed systems like ADEPT will make our planet smarter, more efficient, and open up a huge range of economic opportunities. We believe these technological changes represent the biggest revolution since the origin of general purpose computing and transaction processing systems.”\n\nWith the proof of concept complete, IBM’s ADEPT team, along with its collaborators in Samsung and elsewhere in the open source community, plans to move forward with the platform’s development.\n\nThe code has already been shared and an API suite development is in progress for the ADEPT core stack. The team’s work products will be made available at a later date on both IBM BlueMix and Git.\n\nIBM’s full paper can be downloaded here.', ""The world leader in payment termnials Ingenico announced today that its next generation POS terminals, the TELIUM TETRA, will accept Bitcoin thanks to a partnership with French Bitcoin startup Paymium, which operates one of Europe’s largest Bitcoin exchanges.

Will the requirements of recording every bitcoin transaction in the blockchain compromise its security (because fewer users will keep a copy of the whole blockchain) or its ability to handle a great number of transactions (because new blocks on which transactions can be recorded are only produced at limited intervals)? In this article, we’ll explore several meanings of “blockchain scalability” and some high-level technical solutions to the issue.\n\nThe three main stumbling blocks to blockchain scalability are:\n\nThe tendency toward centralization with a growing blockchain: the larger the blockchain grows, the larger the requirements become for storage, bandwidth, and computational power that must be spent by “full nodes” in the network, leading to a risk of much higher centralization if the blockchain becomes large enough that only a few nodes are able to process a block. The bitcoin-specific issue that the blockchain has a built-in hard limit of 1 megabyte per block (about 10 minutes), and removing this limit requires a “hard fork” (ie. backward-incompatible change) to the bitcoin protocol. The high processing fees currently paid for bitcoin transactions, and the potential for those fees to increase as the network grows. We won’t discuss this too much, but see here for more detail.\n\nWe’ll consider these first two issues in detail.\n\nThe role of mining: Determining consensus and incentivizing participation\n\nBitcoin (or, more generally, cryptocurrency) mining serves several functions. Mining allows the peer-to-peer network that bitcoin is composed of to agree on a canonical order of transactions, thus solving the double spend problem. The double spend problem isn’t obvious in a traditional (i.e. centralized) context. Imagine a central arbiter or clearinghouse receiving transaction requests from clients to transfer money between parties. If the clearinghouse received two conflicting transactions (i.e. checks with the same number made out to different parties, or two checks that obviously emptied an account), then the clearinghouse could easily reject one or both of the transactions. The key property that the clearinghouse has is omniscience – it has total knowledge of all account balances and pending transfers.\n\nBitcoin partially does away with omniscience. In a peer-to-peer system, one does not generally have the expectation of knowledge of all messages. However, bitcoin transactions are intended to be broadcast one-to-all by peer forwarding. Thus, in principle, every network participant should have total knowledge of account states and pending transfers. A problem arises when a malicious actor propagates two conflicting transactions to the network. The peer-to-peer network must decide which transaction came first and must invalidate the second.\n\nIn broad terms, every transaction is confirmed by inclusion in a published block. A block is simply a set of transactions plus some data, including a timestamp and the hash of the previous block. The inclusion of the previous block hash cryptographically ties the current block to the previous block, as subsequent blocks will require the current block’s hash. If anything in a block is later modified, one could compute its hash and will find a different value as the stated one (with overwhelming probability), as such, one will not accept that block. Thus, including the previous block’s hash in the current block incorporates the entire system history into the current block.\n\nLet’s return to the double spend problem. Bitcoin solves the double spend problem by imposing that honest miners accept the first transaction that they see. That transaction is still unconfirmed until it is published in a block. Blocks are found by mining, which is the process of expending computing power to solve cryptographic puzzles. Given a puzzle solution, a miner earns the right to publish a block and gain a reward for his service. Interestingly, as Satoshi argued in the original whitepaper, this imbues bitcoin with subjective value.\n\nOther miners won’t accept a miner’s block if it contains two conflicting transactions, so the miner must choose between the two in order to get the reward. On receipt of a block, a miner may choose to accept it or not. If the block is valid (i.e. contains no conflicting or mal-formed transactions), miners are expected to accept it by default. A miner signals acceptance of a block by searching for subsequent blocks and including the hash of the received block into those blocks.\n\nTrends toward centralization\n\nMany bitcoin thinkers have argued that the returns to bitcoin mining with a large group of processors will cause a tendency toward a small number of miners or mining pools winning the majority of the blocks (and, by consequence, having the most influence over the network). We can already observe empirically that more than 50% of the hashpower securing the network right now is owned by just five entities – see figure 1. This is a real security threat. Five is a small enough number that state-level actors could directly coerce all five entities without too much trouble. Five is also small enough that active collusion would be fairly easy to coordinate.\n\nWhether this distribution of mining power will be typical in the long run remains to be seen. Satoshi’s gentleman’s agreement to delay the mining arms race is clearly over. The hope that the average hobbyist could fire up the client, donate a few clock-cycles and be welcomed into the bitcoin ecosystem with a block reward is now certainly dead.\n\nGrowth Trend\n\nThe bitcoin blockchain is a massively replicated, append-only ledger. Its entries are transactions of various types, including transfers from one pseudonymous public key to another, coinbase transactions (which mint new bitcoins), and transactions that encode and store some sort of metadata on the blockchain. Full nodes must store the entire blockchain for the following reasons (and more):\n\nBitcoin balances are defined by the blockchain, specifically by the extant set of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) Bitcoin’s transaction validation / verification algorithm requires knowledge of the entire history of the protocol Mining bitcoins requires full knowledge of the blockchain (more precisely, mining requires knowledge of the hash of the previous block, which is proof, in a loose cryptographic sense, of complete knowledge of the blockchain).\n\nThe bitcoin blockchain is presently about 25 GB in size. Downloading the blockchain peer-to-peer takes about 48 hours, and of course 25 GB of disk space. This is a serious user experience flaw; though, we’ve heard that improvements are in the works.\n\nA log plot of the size of the blockchain over the last two years reveals an approximately linear trend:\n\nComputing a best fit line to the logarithmic data reveals an approximate factor of 1.8 increase in the size of the blockchain per year. It’s too early to assess the robustness of this trend, but as with many technology growth curves, we should see an exponential pattern for some time.\n\nTo assess the extent to which disk space is a problem, we need to compare to projections for disk space. Hard disk capacities per dollar have been flat for a few years, breaking a mostly exponential trend. Whether this is due to the October 2011 floods in Taiwan or some intrinsic technological barrier remains to be seen, but it’s a good reminder of both the merits and difficulties of decentralization.\n\nThe UTXO set and prunability\n\nAs mentioned before, bitcoin balances are equivalent to the set of unspent transaction outputs on the blockchain. Each transaction creates one or more new unspent transaction outputs. To verify a new transfer from public key A to public key B, the bitcoin client does (or did) a search across the whole blockchain for transactions involving transaction outputs involving public key A, to verify that the unspent transaction output referenced in the transfer is truly unspent.\n\nA possible optimization to this protocol is simply to store the set of (currently) unspent transaction outputs, rather than the whole blockchain history. The UTXO set is about 500 Mb in size (The chainstate/* directory on my machine is about 550M, but that includes metadata.), and therefore fits in memory. Its growth probably tracks the size of the entire blockchain. One can use advanced data structures similar to Patricia trees to ensure that data encoding is efficient and that lookups are very fast. “Prunability” refers to the property of transactions that aren’t spendable — perhaps they encode metadata or contain bitcoins that were intentionally “burnt” — to be removed from the UTXO set. The OP_RETURN operator is intended to allow the storage of a small amount of metadata (40 bytes) in a transaction. A script consisting only of an OP_RETURN is obviously a data storage operation that can be provably pruned from the UTXO set.\n\nLight clients\n\nLight clients allow the end user to interact with the bitcoin blockchain and to make and confirm transactions without committing the disk space and without the user experience overhead headache. Light clients do not store the whole bitcoin blockchain, nor even the UTXO set. Rather, light clients allow users to receive lightweight proofs of the existence of certain UTXOs from miners, thus allowing the users to verify their balances. Light clients assume a certain amount of trust in miners to significantly reduce resource overhead.\n\nMultiple chains, sharding and merge mining\n\nSuppose that a killer app emerges that massively increases the bitcoin transaction volume, far beyond the exponent predicted above. What could we do then, to allow the average user to still run the full verification algorithm and be assured of his bitcoin holdings? One approach is a partial-sharding of the blockchain. Before we start rolling out the distributed hash tables, we assert that content-addressable solutions to blockchain storage are not immediately applicable. The reason is that distributed responsibility schemes are not sybil proof – such schemes allow actors to be the judge in their own case(s), so to speak, by pretending to be many distinct identities.\n\nWe could potentially shard the blockchain by replacing it with many independent blockchains, interoperating in a semi-trusted manner via cross-chain miners. Cross-chain miners would facilitate transfers across different chains and respond to requests for lightweight proofs of the existence of transactions on distant chains. The end user could run a full mining and validating client on his main chain (perhaps coded geographically or otherwise) and could run light clients on other chains of interest.\n\nAssuming that all these chains are mined, this brings up the immediate problem of security. The argument goes as follows — suppose there is a fixed universe of computational power to secure all the chains, and consider two scenarios:\n\nThere exists one bloated blockchain with 100% of the computational power in the universe. There exist 100 lightweight blockchains each with 1% of the computational power in the universe.\n\nIn the second scenario, it would only take 1% of the computational power in the universe to 51% attack a given chain — to computationally “overpower” one of the honest 99.\n\nA possible solution to this problem is merge-mining. Merge-mining refers to the possibility of mining blocks simultaneously across different chains. Namecoin, a sort of blockchain-based DNS protocol, is merge-mined. One approach that has been suggested for scalability is for there to exist 100 lightweight blockchains that are separate, but merge-mined with each other for security. However, the problem is that in this setup, all miners would need to keep track of all 100 blockchains (or at least a majority of them) for the merge-mining to be secure, and at this point there once again arises the need for a class of nodes to exist that process nearly every transaction, so we are right back at square one. Thus, merge-mining doesn’t actually allow us to shard the blockchain; the tradeoff above appears intrinsic.\n\nAdvanced sharding\n\nMore advanced forms of sharding that attempt to ensure that every individual “shard” of the blockchain is implicitly protected by a large part of the strength of the entire system do exist, but with only a very small portion of the network explicitly watching each shard by default. Such schemes might involve some combination of multiple strategies. One approach is challenge-response protocols, where if a particular transaction is invalid, some node can “call attention” to the invalidity and either provide an efficiently verifiable proof that a transaction is invalid, or produce a “challenge” that must be met by a “response” in the form of some kind of efficiently verifiable proof of validity.\n\nAnother approach, applicable only to proof-of-stake algorithms, is the idea of randomly selecting, and often reshuffling, the set of miners (in proof of stake, typically called “voters” or “validators”) for a shard from a very large set taken from the entire blockchain. This means that an attacker would need to take over a substantial percentage of the entire blockchain in order to successfully corrupt even one shard, but at the same time only a very small number of validators need to actually process every transaction.\n\nA third category of approaches involves techniques from advanced cryptography, involving a category of technology called “zero-knowledge proofs.” A few approaches exist that have been very recently developed to allow you to create cryptographic proofs that a particular computation has a particular output, and these proofs can be verified very quickly without running the actual computation. This technique can potentially be used for proving block validity, though it is important to note that even with such schemes “data availability” problems might still remain in place; attackers trying to harm the network could produce blocks that are valid, and provably so, but deliberately not publish some of the information in the blocks in an attempt to throw off others. Solutions to this problem will differ depending on the specific approach.\n\nBandwidth\n\nAn average bitcoin transaction is about 250 bytes. A cable modem, running optimally at 10 megabits per second can therefore facilitate 5,000 bitcoin transactions per second. Bitcoin is nowhere near this bandwidth cap.\n\nBitcoin blocks are hard-capped at 1 MB in size. Considering the amount of data that each transaction creates and the fact that the mining algorithm is set up to allow a new block every 10 minutes (on average), this implies a theoretical limit of about seven transactions per second. When bitcoin transaction volume starts to push that limit, we might see fees go up or possibly changes to the bitcoin core. This would require a hard fork, which is generally considered undesirable.\n\nConclusion\n\nBlockchain scalability is an essential set of issues that must be tackled as blockchain technologies become more popular. It’s particularly difficult to build for scalability and to maintain backward compatibility. Solutions are being proposed, in academic papers and whitepapers, but we’ll have to wait and see what really works.', 'We’re not there yet, but in less than 10 years, I believe that the technology behind bitcoin will transform the accounting profession entirely.\n\nWhat is this technology? The blockchain.\n\nLet me set the scene by going over a few bitcoin related concepts before explaining why I think that the accounting profession will undergo a major disruption in the coming years.\n\nWhat is the blockchain?\n\nWhen most people think about bitcoin, they think about it as a currency. But there’s a much more powerful technology that allows bitcoin “the currency” to exist in the first place and it’s called “the blockchain.” Many people in the bitcoin space are unphased by the recent crash of the bitcoin price because the blockchain as a technology is far more powerful (and exciting) than bitcoin as a currency.\n\nThe blockchain is a public, decentralized, distributed ledger that is capable of storing and confirming the transactions that pass through it. This means that the ledger is not owned nor controlled by any one party. Instead the control of the network, or protocol, is distributed among the network’s users. As transactions hit the blockchain, they are confirmed as true and accurate by the network’s users, called miners.\n\nIf you see a transaction on the blockchain, the transaction has been confirmed and it cannot be reversed. If you sent me a bitcoin today, the bitcoin will transfer from your wallet to mine via the blockchain and before I receive that bitcoin, miners on the network will confirm its validity.\n\nMiners exist in order to secure the network and to confirm the legitimacy of transactions passing through the blockchain. Miners are users who run computers all day in the hopes of solving complex mathematical equations issued by the network. As these problems are solved, they are rewarded for their efforts by receiving a predetermined amount of bitcoins. When you see a bitcoin in your wallet, it’s confirmed as legitimate. To understand more about how transactions are confirmed, you would need to read up on how mining works. It’s fairly technical.\n\nIf you think about it, it’s pretty brilliant. There can be upwards of $50 million USD worth of bitcoin running through the blockchain on any given day (sometimes more), and this network is not owned nor governed by any central authority. It pretty much runs on autopilot thanks to the amazing code that backs it.\n\nThe element of trust\n\n\n\nThe blockchain is pure peer-to-peer. Just like what Napster did to the music industry, I would expect the blockchain to be doing the exact same to many other industries, only on a larger scale.\n\nWhen we are dealing with the blockchain we are not going through any intermediary except the user on the other end of the transaction. If I receive a bitcoin from you, it is sent directly from you and into my bitcoin wallet. If a bitcoin is in my wallet, it’s not held by anyone other than me.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, when you look at your bank statement for instance, the balance you see in your account is simply an IOU from your bank, or put another way, a promise to pay you back. We put our trust that this institution will honour this IOU, but why? Same thing with your insurance policy. We “trust” that the insurance company will honour the policy if ever the conditions were met. Again, why do we trust this third party without even putting thought into it?\n\nThe blockchain is capable of eliminating this trust factor. On a very basic level, when you have a bitcoin in your wallet, you do not need to trust any third party to hold their end of the bargain. Going one step further, one of the hotter topics in cryptocurrency at the moment has to do with “smart contracts,” which allows the blockchain to automatically execute the terms of a contract which is effectively the complete elimination of trust. Contracts can be placed on the blockchain and as conditions are met, the terms of the contract are executed. This isn’t something that’s happening way off in the future—it’s happening right as we speak.\n\nI’m not trying to go all anti-regulatory on you here, because I do believe in regulation, but the fact is that we blindly put our trust in different people and organizations everyday without actually giving it second thought.\n\nThe important thing to note with the blockchain is that this technology has removed the element of trust. This is why bitcoin as a currency is causing a stir. The blockchain is a technology that has allowed for the creation of a peer-to-peer network in order to transact a currency (ie. bitcoin) in a totally decentralized manner, a space that is typically one of the most centralized and regulated yet is managing to do so effectively and efficiently.\n\nI am not trying to argue that centralized is better than decentralized and that unregulated is better than regulated; I am simply saying that the technology itself has allowed for the removal of trust with bitcoin transactions.\n\nA note on ledgers\n\nAt its core, the blockchain is simply a ledger. Just like you have a ledger for your accounting records to hold information about your expenses and revenues, the blockchain acts as a ledger to hold information about the history of every single bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe blockchain ledger can never be altered and records can never be destroyed. Information can only be added to the ledger, never removed. Before anything can be added to the ledger however, it needs to be validated and confirmed by miners who secure the legitimacy of the network and the transactions passing through it.\n\nAt the end of the day, the blockchain is a ledger that stores data that has been verified as true and accurate. While it has proven itself capable of being able to transfer bitcoins, it’s also capable of doing much more than that.\n\nThe blockchain can hold more than bitcoins\n\nWe know that bitcoins can be transferred on the blockchain, but you can also transfer the ownership of just about any asset you want using blockchain technology. There are many reasons why one would want to use the blockchain to transfer ownership of one’s assets other than bitcoins on the blockchain (say, your house?). Reasons include efficiency, effectiveness, removal of third party trust and cost—but we’ll leave this for another discussion.\n\nRemember that when you sell your home, you aren’t actually physically transferring the asset, you’re simply using a piece of paper signed by you, the purchaser and the notary in order to transfer ownership of that asset. The blockchain is simply a digital way to transfer ownership of assets in a more efficient and a more effective way.\n\nTo make a distinction between different types of property on the blockchain, one method of doing so would be through the use of what some people in the space sometimes refer to as “colored coins.” Basically (and I’m really watering it down here), if you wanted to transfer title of your house via the blockchain, you would attach the deed of sale to a coin with a unique “color” or cryptographic property which would then identify this coin as your home on the blockchain.\n\nOther projects are popping up to allow for the transfer of anything of value over blockchain technology. Montreal’s Blockstream, which raised $21 million dollars in funding in November, has been working on a project that will enhance the utility of the blockchain via what they call sidechains. The project will allow for the creation of an ecosystem that speaks to the blockchain which will enable for the transfer of anything of value in a 100% trustless manner.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThe blockchain that currently fuels bitcoin the currency is just the start. The innovation that is currently taking place on the blockchain is really just in the early stages. As the technology evolves, more and more businesses will prefer to transact via the blockchain and we’ll see businesses transferring ownership of assets using this type of technology. This financial data will now be contained in the blockchain’s ledger.\n\nThe role of an accountant\n\n\n\nA financial statement is merely a summation of what happened in a company’s ledger throughout the period. An auditor’s job is to issue an opinion on the reasonableness of the financial statements that are prepared by a company’s management. They are there to basically say, “Yes, we think these financial statements make sense” or “No, we think that there is a material discrepancy between what management has prepared and what we think they should be.”\n\nThe opinion an auditor gives on a financial statement is important as outside parties sometimes rely on the auditor’s opinion and the corresponding financial statements when making investment decisions. If the company’s financial statements look promising and the auditor issues an opinion that states that the financial statements appear accurate, then an individual or a business may decide to go forward with their investment in that business. This is why it is said that the auditor has a duty to protect the public when performing an audit since the public is relying on, or “trusting,” the auditor for certain investment decisions.\n\nThe purpose of an auditor is to be an independent third party that verifies whether the financial statements are accurate. But it cannot be ignored that there is an inherent bias that exists because auditors are collecting fees (ie. revenues) from their client in order to conduct the audit and as such the bias exists to protect the client (at the expense of the public) and therefore protect the firm’s revenues. While our code of ethics, our training and our professionalism is something that we take very seriously as a profession, this bias cannot be ignored.\n\nThere is also the risk that the company’s management, for their own self-interest, “cooks the books” in a way that isn’t detected by the auditors and as such, the financial statements that outside parties might be relying on may be inaccurate.\n\nThis is where we circle back to the concept of trust. When an auditor issues an audit opinion on the financial statements and when they say that these financial statements are reasonably prepared, we trust that the auditors have done a proper job and we therefore trust the financial statements. We trust that all internal biases and self-interest has been put aside for the proper protection of the public. But this isn’t always the case. Sometimes this bias does get in the way and sometimes the public is affected by scandals like Enron.\n\nIn either case, the financial statements that outside investors may be relying on could be inaccurate and therefore not suitable for decision making purposes. This is where I think the blockchain can play an integral role in how an audit could be conducted and therefore, how the accounting profession can be affected.\n\nWhat the blockchain means for accountants\n\n\n\nA financial statement includes various different accounts such as revenue accounts, asset accounts, liability accounts and expense accounts. Each account holds a variety of transactions that comprise the balance in that account. Part of an auditor’s job entails looking at these accounts and determining which ones they want to verify during their audit.\n\nFor instance, if you have a sales account in your books that has a balance of $10 million dollars at the end of the year, the auditor may want to ensure the reasonableness of that account, so they’ll perform certain procedures on their end. They might confirm these sales with your clients, they may check your sales invoices and link the money back to your bank account, they may perform a variety of different procedures that they see fit to get comfort over that number and to confirm that these transactions have actually occurred and that they are complete.\n\nAt the end of the day, all audit procedures entail confirming transactions and balances that are stated on a company’s accounting ledger. As we have seen above, the blockchain can do this by itself, without the use of a third party, in this case, the auditor. Theoretically, everything that is on the books of the company and therefore everything comprising a company’s financial statements could occur on the blockchain.\n\nAs we have already seen that transactions on the blockchain ledger can be confirmed as true and accurate, having a third party such as an auditor re-confirm these transactions would no longer be necessary. As such, the role of the auditor, and therefore the accounting profession would be completely transformed. The role would, at best, be greatly reduced and at worst, be completely eliminated.\n\nThink this all sounds crazy? Australia, one of the world’s most forward-thinking countries when it comes to accounting, had a report issued from their Department of Industry in December 2014 entitled “Australian Industry Report.” The job most at risk of being automated, according to their report, is the accounting, bookkeeping and auditing clerk position. The bookkeeping position is already being massively transformed, and this is from simple OCR technology. The code behind the blockchain is way more sophisticated and arguably one of the most advanced pieces of tech out there since the internet. The possibilities of what it can do is pretty much endless.\n\nThe impact of the blockchain\n\n\n\nThere are those who say that something like this can never happen. They’ll say, technology simply cannot eliminate what a well trained professional can do and that a technology like the blockchain doesn’t stand a chance in replacing what some accountants do.\n\nBut look at where we are now. Our accounting firm, for instance, doesn’t meet clients face to face, we don’t touch paper and engage in zero manual data entry when preparing a client’s books. Five years ago, people in the accounting profession would have thought that this was crazy, but thanks to technology, we’ve been able to advance to a point where this is possible and the profession is currently seeing a massive disruption.\n\nThe blockchain, in my opinion, is the next level of disruption for the profession due to the parallels it has with accounting, which I had listed above.\n\nNo doubt, my peers will probably give me a bit of flack on this one. After all: I am a CPA, CA who was trained as an auditor.\n\nThis guest article was written by Ryan Lazanis of Xen Accounting.', 'Amid the rapid adoption of multi-signature technology by industry players, Gem is going from strength to strength, partnering with several high-profile cryptocurrency service providers who have learnt from the mistakes of the past.\n\nThese mistakes are addressed by exchanges, wallet providers, payment processors, and others in the ecosystem migrating away from custodial models to noncustodial 2-of-3 multi-signature models, where hackers gaining access to a single online key cannot do anything with that key.\n\n“All digital coins should be stored on wallets with multi-signature keys,” explained the CEO of LazyCoins to CoinTelegraph, Danial Daychopan. “By requiring multiple individuals to authorize transactions, you eliminate single points of failure.” He added:\n\n“Because no one person can ever access the wallet, you greatly reduce the risk of theft from hackers or internal fraud.”\n\nEthereum’s Founder, Vitalik Buterin called multi-sig “the future of Bitcoin” back in March of last year and that future appears to be quickly approaching as many security solution providers such as Gem have been trying to hone the technology.\n\nGem Secures Cryptosigma, Expresscoin\n\nSince its unveiling in September, the company has signed with both Cryptosigma and Expresscoin among others, both of whom wish to offer workable wallets for everyday consumers without the threat of security breaches being a mere step away.\n\n“From the very beginning, we wanted Gem to empower digital currency companies to focus on building great user experiences, instead of focusing on infrastructure,” Gem’s CEO and founder Micah Winkelspecht said in a press release regarding the Expresscoin deal.\n\nThe increasing popularity of multi-signature bitcoin transactions is illustrated in this chart from BitGo:\n\nSecurity issues directly affecting the average cryptocurrency user have come to the fore again recently. In 2015, amid continually growing knowledge of Bitcoin in particular, it is not just the Mt. Gox scandal which remains as a distant warning to heed, but the serious compromises at Bitstamp and several smaller exchanges as well as popular digital wallet providers. All these give the competition increasing cause for concern, and even the most confident developers are now looking to ensure complete security at any cost.\n\nGem entered the scene at an ideal time, and multi-sig security is being seen as the new standard for digital wallets; an industry best practice.\n\n“The beauty of multi-sig is that when implemented appropriately, it actually provides much better security than the historical custodial account model,” Gem’s new COO, ex-PayPal executive Ken Miller told CoinTelegraph. “With multi-sig, instances like Mt. Gox would never happen.”\n\nMiller was speaking within the context of the Cryptosigma partnership, which will see Cryptosigma launch with Gem’s wallet technology. Cryptosigma Founder and CEO, Aaron Siwoku, explained to CoinTelegraph in an exclusive interview :\n\n“When we see the migration of exchanges […] to the implementation of non-custodial user wallets, [coupled] with the implementation of multi-sig wallets, […] over time we will see a mind-numbing reduction in the percentage of wallet funds that are compromised each year.”\n\nCryptosigma will use an operational wallet from Gem that uses multi-signature transaction signing. This means that if the hot wallet is compromised, it will be very easy to stop signing transactions and move the funds without having to take the exchange offline for a few days while the platform is secured as we recently saw with a popular European exchange, which learned to implement multi-sig security the hard way.\n\nSimilarly, Expresscoin has also unveiled a two-step integration plan, firstly involving use of Gem’s API in its internal operations, with a full Gem wallet being made available to customers later on.\n\n“Gem’s cutting-edge platform offers our customers the security and flexibility they desire and allows us to focus on providing a superior service,” Will Wheeler, CEO of the Santa Monica-based exchange, said in the Gem press release, adding that Expresscoin’s “number one priority” was “keeping our customers’ funds safe while allowing them full control and manageability of their coins.”\n\nThe New Security Standard\n\nGem’s technology has garnered enthusiasm since its launch due to its ability to combine a suitable level of security with the all-important “resonance with users,” as Miller puts it, which is so vital to the success of wallets with the mainstream.\n\n“2014 was a monumental year for legitimizing bitcoin as a currency,” Miller continues. “2015 should be the year it becomes mainstream; however, crucial to its wide adoption and advancement is trust in its security, and we’re excited to provide that security to expresscoin and all other apps and services.”\n\nOf course, multi-sig security is still a work in progress and cannot solve all of Bitcoin’s security issues in one fell swoop. But keep in mind that if the only thing separating your coins from a hacker is a single private key, especially one controlled by a third party, then your account will be the preferred target compared to one that requires multiple actors to unlock the funds. Using a single-key model might very well become the equivalent of drawing a target on one’s back for hackers since their job becomes much easier.\n\nThus, it is no surprise that multi-sig security is starting to establish a firm footing in the cryptospace and is on the fast track to becoming common practice and an industry standard. Danial Daychopan concludes:\n\n“When digital currencies become part of mainstream business, multi-sig is likely to be one of the ways corporations prevent individual fraud and external theft.”\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Casey St. Martin’s. 357 pp. $27.99\n\nBitcoin is remarkably polarizing. Technology evangelists and central-bank critics ardently believe — no, they know — that the digital currency can liberate mankind from the tyranny of banks and government-backed paper money. Skeptics note that, like other new technological disruptions, bitcoin attracts innovators and hucksters in equal measure. How can a currency created by an anonymous coder and backed by no state, and whose value flaps around like a flag in a swirling wind, hope to challenge the global economic order and replace the dollar?\n\nTo their ample credit, Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey, veteran Wall Street Journal reporters, resist the common temptation to hype their trendy subject. They’ve written a reported explainer that patiently documents bitcoin’s rise, acknowledges its flaws and highlights its promise. Smart and conscientious, “The Age of Cryptocurrency” is the most thorough and readable account of the short life of this controversial currency.\n\n‘The Age of Cryptocurrency: How Bitcoin and Cybermoney are Overturning the Global Economic Order’ by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey (St. Martin's)\n\nBitcoin isn’t actually money. Rather, it’s a “highly disruptive technology” — a software and transaction verification system that lets people communicate with others — that has the modest goal of “freeing people from the tyranny of centralized trust.” It came on the scene in 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) introduced a peer-to-peer system that instructs computers how to keep track of transactions, using encryption and digital signatures, in a highly transparent way. The “blockchain” — a universal ledger that grows with each completed transaction — allows people to “exchange all sorts of digitized items of value and any manner of useful data with confidence that the information is accurate.” And it ingeniously provides financial incentives for people (or their computers) to keep the ledger up to date. How?\n\nTransactions in bitcoin aren’t completed with a handshake or the issuance of a receipt. And unlike Pay\xadPal or electronic banking, they don’t involve the documented transfer of funds in specific currencies between large, licensed institutions. Rather, computers connected to the network must “reach a consensus on the validity of each transaction.” Transactions between two individuals are validated only when a third party — a “miner” equipped with a powerful computer — performs a complicated mathematical puzzle. The first to solve the puzzle receives a bitcoin as a sort of commission and officially updates the universal ledger.\n\nThe first commercial bitcoin transaction was completed in May 2010, when a Florida programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz offered 10,000 bitcoins to anybody who would pay cash to have a Papa John’s cheese pizza delivered to his house. A fellow enthusiast in England took him up on the offer. As more users adopted the currency, Nakamoto — who had announced that he’d issue only 21 million bitcoins over time — essentially disappeared. He (or possibly she?) last posted on the bitcoin forum in December 2010. “All we have is the specter of a reclusive genius, and a hint at the godhead of bitcoin,” Vigna and Casey write.\n\nLike the Internet, bitcoin is a networks-effect business — it becomes more powerful the more people connect to it. Vigna and Casey introduce us to the array of early adopters who have emerged from the woodwork to mine and buy bitcoin — and the wide variety of uses and hopes they have for it. We meet Austin and Beccy Craig, a young couple who tried to live for 90 days using only bitcoin. In Barbados, we meet Gabriel Abed, a.k.a. Mr. Bit, who sees the digital currency’s low transaction fees as a quantum leap for small Caribbean nations that currently maintain their own currencies. In Afghanistan, a nonprofit wants to use bitcoin to pay women, thus relieving them of culturally problematic visits to bank branches. The authors take us, too, to Silicon Valley, where young hackers and establishment venture capitalists such as Netscape founder Marc Andreesen are busily backing and building bitcoin apps, exchanges and businesses.\n\nIt is impressive how a small community of enthusiasts has willed bitcoin from a theoretical concept into a cultural phenomenon. Bitcoin, improbably, has become a thing. But is it money? Here, the authors are appropriately skeptical — though perhaps not sufficiently so. “One familiar benchmark says that for a currency to become money it must function as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value,” they write. Bitcoin has definitely succeeded in becoming a medium of exchange for some — Microsoft accepts it as payment. But a store of value? Not so much.\n\n“Bitcoin’s price in dollars soared 8,500 percent in the first eleven months of 2013, but then lost two thirds of its value in the following six months,” the authors write. In June 2011, about 7 percent of the bitcoins in circulation went missing from Mt. Gox, a bitcoin exchange that subsequently went bust. Whoops! Silk Road, an online mart where people could use bitcoin to buy or sell stuff anonymously — including drugs such as crystal meth, it turns out — was shut down by federal authorities in October 201 3.\n\nThese are predictable growing pains — the early Web was a series of business debacles, and just look at it now. And the larger trends do seem to be working in favor of a payment system that avoids the high fees and political complications of banks. “This is a digital age, and bitcoin is digital money,” the authors write. “In a world where so much commerce is done online, simplicity and cost savings are in its favor.”\n\nThat’s all true. But bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aren’t really challenging the global economic order. They remain marginal, unstable and little understood, and their spread has done nothing to chip away at the dominance of the Federal Reserve and the People’s Bank of China — and the currencies managed by those enormously powerful central banks attached to enormously powerful governments.\n\nBeyond inertia and entrenched power, there are forces working against bitcoin in particular and against cryptocurrencies in general. In a world filled with ingenious hackers, digital thieves and other rogues, exclusively digital products — information, content, money — aren’t exactly safe. (Just ask Sony.) The potential for fraudulent transactions in some circumstances is also a worry.\n\nWhat’s more, money is already going digital in ways that are challenging the primacy of banks. Apps such as Venmo let people send money to one another for free. In Africa, M-Pesa, which allows individuals of very modest means to send money via text message and store it via simple cellphones, already has 18 million customers and is doing far more to disrupt traditional banking than bitcoin.\n\nThe authors are right to conclude that we shouldn’t put all our chips on bitcoin, whose value in early January stood at less than one-quarter of its December 2013 peak. “Bitcoin will end up something less than the stateless, third-party-less utopian dream of its most passionate supporters,” Vigna and Casey write. It will continue to be a thing, not the thing. Even so, bitcoin will pressure incumbents and others in adjacent fields to innovate, much the way the Toyota Prius and Tesla have placed pressure on traditional automakers to step up their efficiency game. Thanks to the occasionally reckless and cryptic innovators of the bitcoin universe, the financial system “will have some much needed competition and discipline forced upon it.”\n\nYou can bank on that."", 'Bitspark Limited, a digital currency startup based in Hong Kong, announces a partnership with Indonesian startup PT ArtaBit Indonesia to enable end-to-end remittance services from Hong Kong to Indonesia, targeting the 165,000 overseas Indonesian workers present in the city-state who commonly send funds to their families and loved ones.\n\nBitspark, which concluded a partnership with Filipino Rebit.ph back in November 2014, to enable similar remittance services to the Philippines, believes ""the benefits of Bitcoin shouldn\'t only be exclusive to tech savvy individual,"" and allows Hong Kongese to send funds abroad without the need of having a Bitcoin wallet, nor even knowing what Bitcoin is.\n\nCommenting on their recent partnership with Bitspark, Denny Muktar, business development director at PT Artabit, stated:\n\n""At Artabit, we see the true power of Bitcoin, not as a currency, but as an underlying transport protocol. Few people have an understanding of SWIFT or even have heard of it. Yet, trillions of dollars are moved on this protocol. With our Bitspark partnership, neither the sender nor their relatives in Indonesia have to understand or even be aware of the existence of Bitcoin.""\n\nBitspark utilizes Bitcoin as a mean of transmission, which drastically cuts the cost of overseas remittances and provides quicker transfers to thousands of locations throughout Indonesia and the Philippines, the company stated in an announcement.\n\nThe process for the remittance service is quite simple and requires Hong Kong senders to go to BitSpark\'s counter at World-Wide House, a popular migrant worker hangout, and hand over the amount in Hong Kong dollars they\'d like to transfer. Bitspark then coordinates with its Indonesian partner, PT Artabit, which will enable the Indonesia recipient to collect the funds within 24 hours from either a bank branch or a local postal office.\n\n""Indonesia is an exciting opportunity and a key focus for us, it’s a very different market in terms of logistics and distribution than our existing Philippines services with many people using Post Offices as the primary cash pickup location, not third party remittance stores,"" commented George Harrap, CEO at Bitspark.\n\nHe continued:\n\n""We are the cheapest option to send money to Indonesia and while other remittance services may support either bank pickup or post office pickups, we can do both, quicker and cheaper than the competition it’s a win\xadwin for the customer.""\n\nBitspark said it is currently completing 10 to 20 transfers a day, reported CoinDesk. However, volume has been doubling every week, notably due to business customers who mostly remit funds fortnightly compared to individuals who would typically remit monthly, said Harrap.\n\nHarrap further noted that his company is now transferring more money for companies than individuals. He explained:\n\n""Employment agencies will often have an office in the Philippines where they source many of the candidates. They have bills to pay in the Philippines.""\n\nBitspark charges a flat fee.

He has a long history of many years of investment and research into poverty in the Third World, and how things can be improved. Now, he has published his 3rd-annual Gates Annual Letter, which is a sort of State-of-the-Third-World address on these endeavors. It seems coincidental that it is released at the same time as the President of the United States’ State of the Union Address.\n\nWhat the Third World Needs According to Bill Gates\n\nInside, he posits three issues that are most dire in the plight of impoverished countries worldwide. One, the idea of getting Africa to feed itself, which would help eradicate famine that has killed millions of people annually. Two, the need to drop infant mortality rates and other diseases through better vaccination and medicine. And the third is the ability of these cultures to integrate new growth technologies like mobile or digital banking, in order to build a sustained economy and a middle class of their own.\n\nIn the promotion for his Annual Letter, Bill and Melinda Gates spoke to Backchannel about his views and what he sees going forward as far as helpful innovations. He was asked specifically about Bitcoin, and this is what he had to say:\n\nAre you excited about the potential of Bitcoin in systems like these as a way to keep fees low and have the system work robustly in the global sense? “There’s a lot that Bitcoin or variants can do to make moving money between countries easier and getting fees down pretty dramatically. But Bitcoin won’t be the dominant system. When you talk about a domestic economy, [you must have] the idea of attributed transactions, where if you sent it to the wrong person you could actually get the transaction reversed. [And a traditional system] doesn’t have this huge fluctuation where the value of your account is going up and down by a factor of two. We need things that draw on the revolution of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin alone is not good enough.”\n\nAlso read: Bill Gates: Bitcoin Technology is Key\n\nAn interesting take on Bitcoin, as this does highlight what many would consider a flaw in the protocol. Or is it a million-BTC opportunity? Could a person, inventor, engineer, company innovate a way to reverse a Bitcoin transaction gone bad, and make the irreversible BTC transfer reversible? Bitcoin is an incredible system, but it is not perfect, and such issues may indeed be holding it back from it’s true potential as a global currency. It’s better than the primitive and highly corruptible fiat currency system, but one of us can improve it? Where some see flaws, others see opportunity for growth. Or maybe the “core developers” can adjust the technology for this capability down the road.\n\nThis is not the first time Gates has spoken about Bitcoin in detail. We reported last year on the interview done by Eric Schatzker of Bloomberg News\n\nThe need to move money from place to place – the cost to do so: the overhead, as you put it – makes me think, believe it or not, of Bitcoin. Because, some people have said: “Hey, you know? Bitcoin is the answer to those problems!” “Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be. Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don’t have to be physically in the same place and of course for large transactions currency can get pretty inconvenient. The customers we’re talking about aren’t trying to be anonymous. You know they’re willing to be known, so the Bitcoin technology is key, and you could add to it. Or you could build a similar technology where there’s enough attribution that people feel comfortable this is nothing to do with terrorism or any money laundering.”\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\nIs the irreversibility of BTC transactions holding Bitcoin back? Should this be fixed, and by whom? Share above and comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Double standards are like mosquitoes to me: after hearing their buzz for a while, I want nothing more than to shine a flashlight their way and swat them down mercilessly. One such double standard is the harsh way in which economists and commentators criticize Bitcoin technology, while at the same time taking for granted the financial system that they live under every day.\n\nYes, the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is very volatile still, and the ecosystem that develops around them has been a Wild West so far. But in the six years of Bitcoin’s existence, the underlying technology—decentralized and open source in nature—has proven itself to be extremely robust and constantly evolving. Bad computer code is replaced over time by good code (or at least by a stable workaround), and likewise, bad companies are forced by the market to make way for better ones. Creative destruction rules the cloud.\n\nThe same things cannot be said about the fiat currency system. Banks and central banks are still running old cranky software, with systems that sometimes haven’t been updated since the 1960s. Vital parts of the service and technology is centralized and therefore frozen in time, in a spiderweb of ever-expanding bureaucratic rules. And bad banks don’t die; they are kept alive with “Bailout IVs” from the government, and they become zombie banks. In Fiat Land, it’s King Inertia who waves the scepter.\n\nFiat money itself is also increasingly fragile. According to a study of 775 fiat currencies, there is no historical record of any that have held their value:\n\n“Twenty percent failed through hyperinflation, 21% were destroyed by war, 12% destroyed by independence, 24% were monetarily reformed, and 23% are still in circulation approaching one of the other outcomes...The average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years.”[1]\n\nThe post gold standard U.S. dollar is no exception. Despite being 44 years of age, which makes it a true veteran of the fiat space, it has lost 97% of its value since inception.[2]\n\nAnd that is just touching the surface of the kind of problems the fiat system produces. As we’ll see in a moment, debt levels, certainly not a sign of economic health, are higher than ever before in history. Inflation is also on the rise in many nations—melting away people’s savings and pushing them into the arms of speculative money managers. And central banks around the world are preparing for bank holidays and bank defaults.\n\nWhen a system is virtually frozen in time and changes only for the worse, it is fair to say that it is broken, and that it needs replacing. That is exactly the state of the financial system today.\n\nNow, over to the nitty gritty. Let’s crunch some numbers to see how big the problems really are.\n\nThe Biggest Debt Crisis in History\n\nIn 2008 we saw a ferocious banking crisis, the worst since the crash of 1929. In response, central banks around the world, including those of the U.S., China, and Europe, printed unprecedented amounts of money to shore up the banking system, and governments wrote out bailout subsidies like never before.\n\nIn Europe, for example, governments committed 1.3 trillion euros[3] to prevent the eurobanks from failing. This led to the 2011 sovereign debt crisis, which was was barely contained by the ECB. It scrambled to put together another 500 billion euro bailout program.\n\nWhat have all these programs, with a combined value of at least $9 trillion, really achieved?\n\nWell, since 2008, “leverage” in the system has dropped from 25:1 to 20:1. This means that for every $20 a bank owes to customers or other banks, it has $1 in hard cash in its own possession. To adequately convey the absurdity of these numbers, an average non-financial corporation in the emerging world (not known for prudent risk management) has a leverage ratio of less than 3:1.[4] In other words, without a central bank as a backstop, most multi-national banks would have been long bankrupt.[5]\n\nGiven the avalanche of bailouts and stimulus programs unleashed since the 2008 crisis, government debt in the developed world has now risen to a record level 111% of GDP.\n\nLet’s also not forget the extremely high private debt everywhere, now at 129% of GDP in the world, and at 300% of GDP in the United States.\n\nWith all this data, it should be no surprise that the BIS estimates the size of the total debt securities market at $100 trillion. That is about $40,000 for every person in the world who has a bank account.[6]\n\nThe only way for countries to accumulate so much debt is for them to print money indefinitely, and to continuously drop interest rates. And indeed, interest rates are the lowest they have been since the Middle Ages.\n\nFrom the 1700s onwards, leading western nations borrowed at rates between 3%-7%, whereas recently we saw a drop in interest rates down to below 1% in the U.S. The rates are a little above 1% now, but German 10-year bonds are trading with interest rates as low as 0.5%. This trend is unprecedented in world history.\n\nGovernments, banks, and households borrowing from institutions that can create money out of thin air leads, of course, to inflation.\n\nIllustrating this is an inflation world map that I made in May 2013:\n\nHere is the updated January 2015 version:\n\nNow, one could argue that this just shows the dollar’s strength rather than actual inflation, but consider that the U.S. dollar still is the world’s reserve currency, and the most important way for foreign central banks to defend the value of their currency is to buy back their own currency from whomever offers them U.S. dollars. As was the case with many other collapsing currencies, the hyperinflation of the ruble in 1998 started when the Russian central bank had no more dollars with which to buy back its own currency.\n\nThat said, the long-term value of the U.S. dollar is highly questionable. Since the U.S. went off the gold standard in 1971, central banks have been increasingly diversifying their reserves, as shown below.\n\nWhereas in the 1970s central banks had no problem with holding up to 65% in U.S. dollars, that amount has now declined to 40%-45%. That certainly doesn’t signal a vote of confidence in the greenback.\n\nNational central banks are also increasingly moving physical gold back within their own jurisdiction. We’ve seen both Germany and the Netherlands repatriate 120 tons each, as well as Poland, Venezuela, Ecuador, Mexico, Switzerland and others participating in the “gold repatriation movement.” It is no coincidence that this movement started in 2011 at the time of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe; governments are afraid of defaults, devaluations, and/or hyperinflation, and want to prepare for the launch of a new currency.\n\nSeeking “Stability”\n\nTake a moment to absorb how gargantuan the problems of the financial system have become.\n\nNow consider this: central bankers often contradict each other and themselves, but one thing they unilaterally stand for is “stability.” The U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, says its goal is “a more stable monetary and financial system.”[7] Its European counterpart, the ECB, has as its mission statement “to maintain price stability and to safeguard the value of the euro.”[8]\n\nWhere is this “stability” central bankers keep talking about? How can we believe in a system that achieves exactly the opposite of that which its leaders proclaim?\n\nOver the last 10 years, central banks have created new money to the tune of $14 trillion, and that amount is still growing. Just this week, the ECB announced that over the next 18 months it will pump another €1.1 trillion into the eurosystem.\n\nHere is what Gideon Gono, Zimbabwean central banker and father of the $100 trillion bill, has to say about the newfangled post-2008 financial paradigm:\n\n“I've been condemned by traditional economists who said that printing money is responsible for inflation. Out of the necessity to exist, to ensure my people survive, I had to find myself printing money. I found myself doing extraordinary things that aren't in the textbooks. Then the IMF asked the U.S. to please print money. I began to see the whole world now in a mode of practicing what they have been saying I should not. I decided that God had been on my side and had come to vindicate me.”[9]\n\nGono is right: his example is being followed by every prestigious central bank in the world. And when journalists dare to mention the elephant in the room, they are scoffed at. In fact, this happened just this week, when ECB chairman Mario Draghi was asked whether his policy of money printing would lead to hyperinflation. He dryly responded that despite the massive stimulus programs, “Somehow this runaway inflation hasn't come yet”.[10]\n\nIn 2008 it became clear that the emperor had no clothes. By now, it should be clear that his entire court is also threadless.\n\nConclusion\n\nI will keep my opinion about what all these financial omens forebode for another time, but it should be clear by now that the fiat system is anything but stable.\n\nIn fact, the stability in our financial system only exists to the extent that people believe in it. It is a mirage much like Bernie Madoff’s “empire” was: as soon as enough people withdraw, it will come tumbling down.\n\nA new crisis is brewing in the system, as has happened every 40 years since governments started monopolizing the industry of money and banking. But this time truly is different. For the first time in history, the people have access to a decentralized, open source and globally accessible backup financial system.\n\nThere may be some problems that arise when Bitcoin technology is scaled up for millions, and then hundreds of millions of users. No doubt there is angst and volatility ahead, and for all we know the Bitcoin network will fail and some other cryptocurrency will take over. But there is no way this ingenious technology is going back into the bottle.\n\nWe now have access to a protocol that allows for honest global banking with or without intermediaries. For those eager to divest from a financial system of falling cards, I highly recommend drawing from an alternative deck: the exciting world of cryptocurrencies.\n\n[2] Since 1971, the dollar depreciated by 97% against gold, and by 83% against the consumer price index."", 'According to a new infographic, featured below, bitcoin is electrifying the non-profit profit sector.\n\n“The piece explores how Bitcoin will revolutionize charitable donations given to non-profit organisations, focusing on how it will work and what challenges donating in digital currencies face in the long run,”\n\nMax Hammond, Digital PR Executive for NeoMam Studies, said upon sharing the infographic.\n\nThe infographic details how non-profits will see benefits from bitcoin, as well as how to accept it in the first place. Bitcoin users can donate directly to the non-profit through a public key, or they can utilize Coinbase, Bitgive or even the new Lighthouse platform.\n\nIt then outlines the benefits bitcoin brings, but the new challenges ahead. It travels into the different facets of bitcoin acceptance by charitable organizations and delves into how some see the future laying ahead for these organizations that have adopted bitcoin with open arms.\n\nThe infographic also outlines how WikiLeaks, the famous information leaking site spearheaded by Julian Assange, collects all their donations through bitcoin and litecoin due to being blocked by Bank of America, MasterCard, PayPal and VISA. Through decentralized digital currency technology, such blockage is impossible and would be considered unethical and immoral.\n\n“It is the privatization of censorship, because this is being done because of extreme pressure by the U.S. Government,”\n\nsaid Kristinn Hrafnsson, spokesman for WikiLeaks. “It’s extremely important to fight back and stop this process right here and now so that we won’t see in the future, where we have the financial giants deciding who lives and who dies in this field.”\n\nNon-Profit Presence in Bitcoin\n\nNonprofit organizations like United Way, Greenpeace, the Wikimedia Foundation and Khan Academy all started accepting bitcoin last year, leading the charge for the transition. In a blog posting upon the announcement of the Wikimedia Foundation’s bitcoin acceptance, Coinbase, the partnering payment processor, made a strong case for the bitcoin-charity revolution.\n\nAlso Read: Wikimedia Foundation Receives $140k in Bitcoin Donations in One Week\n\n“The Internet has made it easier for non-profits to operate by enabling them to increase geographic reach and reduce the overhead required to fundraise. Adding bitcoin as a donation option is a natural next step for non-profits because it eliminates one of the most significant costs remaining —payment processing fees.”\n\nImmediately following, they also announced that they were dropping all processing fees for registered non-profits to accept bitcoin donations, making the venture even more tantalizing. Non-profits accepting bitcoin through Coinbase are now able to cash out their bitcoins for U.S. dollars and receive one bank transfer a day for free.\n\nCompared to donations through PayPal and VISA, it should be almost impossible for non-profits to resist. The bitcoin transaction fees are so small that it changes the way people think about owning their money. When non-profits receive nearly 100 percent of their donations, a lot of opportunities open up along the way for new ventures to change the world. All charitable organizations have a chance in front of them to accept digital currency at the cost of nothing, and it looks like many are starting to jump on board.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The speculation about the Swiss National Bank (SNB) knowing something when they de-pegged the Swiss Franc from the Euro proved true today as the European Central Bank (ECB) launched its own QE today in the form of a 1 trillion euro government bond buying program - approximately 60 billion per month, which is more than the 50 billion people were conjecturing.\n\nThis program will start in March 2015 and go through September 2016. This is the ECB’s latest attempt to battle deflation and try to reflate the Eurozone. On the heels of this news, the Euro sank to 1.14, gold touched US$1,300 for the first time since mid August, and the USD surged to 94.72 (see charts below).\n\nAlso, The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is injecting 500 billion Yuan (US$81 billion) into the nation’s largest banks, according to a government official familiar with the matter, signaling the deepest concern yet with an economic slowdown. Not to mention, Canada also slashed interest rates today as well.\n\nWe are witnessing unprecedented global stimulus to fight a major economic slowdown. Under this backdrop, it is easy to see why the USD is surging as the US has stopped QE and indicated a rate hike at some point this year. The US is perceived to have the strongest economy in the world.\n\nAs mentioned in previous articles, the USD is controlling the intermarket picture. The 15 year monthly chart shows the USD at a place it hasn’t been since 2003. Perhaps parity with the Euro will happen once again. This move is a major one as the chart below is a monthly chart and at the bottom right the 50 month moving average looks ready to cross the 100 month moving average. This is significant and proves this major uptrend is just starting.\n\nThe 5 year monthly Euro chart is almost a mirror reflection of the USD. It has blown through all major support areas. I drew Fibonacci retracements in to look for possible support areas and 111 and 104 seem like the next major areas of support.\n\nIn Spite of USD strength, gold has surged higher. The reasons for this are obvious: global deflation, global growth slowing, currency debasement globally (in fact Gold in Euro and Yens terms has been surging for a while), and doubt about the US recovery.\n\nExpect to hear the term “currency war” in the coming months as all the liquidity being provided by central banks causes massive displacements of capital. If the dollar continues strengthening, the rally in gold should be capped. At the bottom of the gold chart, where there was once a strong positive correlation with bitcoin, (eaning gold and bitcoin went up together) now we are seeing the exact opposite - a negative correlation - where gold is going up and bitcoin is going down. It seems like gold is being considered a superior store of value and flight to safety along with the USD.\n\nAs noted in previous articles, the end of July into the beginning of August is when the USD dollar started surging along with the Shanghai Composite. Gold held steady within that period and in the last month has begun its own up move. Bitcoin has dropped tremendously in that time frame and is trying to find some stability. For now, this pattern still holds. Money is flowing into other asset classes.\n\nMany people predicted the end of the dollar, a European banking collapse, and global depression. This scenario has not played out as global central banks have launched stimulus effort to fight off deflation. The US is the only one not stimulating the dollar and the US stock market has been a major beneficiary.\n\nPerhaps the collapse of oil, coupled with the worry of the ECB, the PBOC, and SNB, along with a whole host of other countries has left an interest rate hike on hold for the “foreseeable future.”\n\nWhat this all means is there’s a whole lot more liquidity sloshing around the globe and it is seeking places where it will make big returns. So far, bitcoin has not been the beneficiary of this. As I have mentioned in a previous article, the price is still searching for a bottom. Bottoming is a process and does not happen over night. In the mean time, there are a few headwinds that need to be overcome in order for the BTC price to stabilize.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The recent $75 million raised by Coinbase, especially at the point when Bitcoin’s value was at the not-so-promising $200, is a symbol that the underlying blockchain is more valuable than the potential of Bitcoins itself.\n\nIt is in this light that the blockchain ledgers are starting to be seen.

His goal, in summary, is “to take Wall Street behind the barn and kill it with an ax.” He wants to give people a chance at having property rights over their stock, which he claims is not the case today.\n\nWhen asked what crypto-equity was, he answered the question in a peculiar way:\n\n“Remember that these institutions that we have in society, like Wall Street, like government. They didn't come to us chiseled on stone from the mountaintop. They're just institutions that we set up to accomplish certain ends.”\n\n“Well, now we can accomplish those same ends using the technology of the crypto revolution,” he said.\n\nAccording to Byrne, the U.S. is “well on its way to an advanced state of oligarchy.” He claims that they “abhor anything that's peer-to-peer” because they can't control it. While the comments sound hyperbolic, keep in mind that last year a Princeton study called the U.S. a, um, well, “oligarchy.”\n\nIn more Bitcoin-esque terms, crypto-equity is a way to distribute company equity shares in “coins.” It entitles the owner to an “equal amount of equity percentage in the company.”\n\nThe Alternative System\n\n“We're building the platform that will let companies issue a crypto-equity,” Byrne said. Overstock will be the first to issue them over Medici. Each coin will represent a share of stock.\n\nIt's a new frontier, which means there are plenty of expected legal hurdles. The team is working with a “big law firm” to get approval from regulators. They're asking how to handle all these things. “Once we do all that, it will be open to other companies,” Byrne said.\n\nThe Overstock CEO thinks that the blockchain, by using its transparent ledger, will slash the possibilities for manipulation. Secondly, by embedding securities in the blockchain, stock owners will have secure property rights over their stocks, which is not the case today. Rather, right now, “you have a daisy chain of contractual rights against someone else who actually owns that property,” said Byrne.\n\n“We're creating an alternative parallel universe where everything's true. You'll really have your property rights. Trading will be peer-to-peer. It's not immobilized by some central institution that's owned by the guys who benefit from there being slop in the system. “People in 10 years are going to wonder: How did we ever think it was OK to operate that way?”\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

01/24/2015,"['Amidst a bearish price cycle and a wave of negative press, it’s safe to say that 2015 may be yet another year filled with growing pains for bitcoin. In the face of these obstacles, however, many of its veteran supporters are standing strong and banding together.\n\nGiven its longstanding support for the digital currency ecosystem, it’s perhaps no surprise that Union Square Ventures (USV) participated in Coinbase’s recent $75m funding round alongside Andreessen Horowitz and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.\n\nUSV has so far participated in three of Coinbase’s four public funding rounds, while appearing at marquee events in the industry’s history.\n\nNotably, principal Fred Wilson has also been outspoken about bitcoin’s regulatory environment and its long-term potential as a technology, often in the face of criticism for his views. Today, USV remains as bullish on the technology as ever.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk about its participation in this week’s funding, Fred Wilson echoed many of his previous positions regarding bitcoin as an investor, while shedding new insights as to what he believes are the most compelling parts of the ecosystem today.\n\nPerhaps most intriguingly, Wilson emphasized that USV is no longer as interested in the financial applications of the blockchain, stating:\n\n”We’re not interested in investing in a company that’s the same as Coinbase. I think Coinbase has a big opportunity in front of itself and so we’re careful not to investment anywhere close to what they’re doing.”\n\nWilson went on to explain that he views Coinbase as a foundational layer for a new suite of applications to be built on top of the bitcoin protocol and with alternative blockchains.\n\nFor example, Wilson cited USV’s investment in decentralised identity protocol provider OneName, which is built on namecoin, as an example of the kinds of projects he most looks forward to seeing developed in the coming years.\n\nFurther, Wilson sought to frame the immediate future as crucial to shaping how the bitcoin ecosystem will develop in the long term.\n\n“It is still very early days for all those projects,” he continued. “We’ll see whether users value the types of things that can be built on top of the blockchain.”\n\nLooking beyond finance\n\nWilson went on to describe the kinds of projects that he is most excited about seeing developed in the coming years.\n\nFor example, he cited decentralized Dropbox-like storage solutions and next-generation databases, as well as new types of marketplaces and ticketing solutions, as potential innovations that could be built on bitcoin’s underlying blockchain ledger.\n\n“There are a whole bunch of things that don’t have anything to do with bitcoin itself, or sending, receiving and storing bitcoin,” Wilson continued.\n\nStill, he stressed that these types of projects are still conceptual, and that a new generation of bitcoin innovators will have to prove that such solutions can reach everyday users.\n\nThe examples mentioned may be noteworthy given that Wilson spoke openly about blockchain-based identity solutions at TechCrunch Disrupt last year, comments that might have hinted at his firm’s later involvement with OneName.\n\nPositive signals\n\nAs for whether other participants in the round shared his views, Wilson was less sure, noting that he has only had conversations with Fortune 500 financial services giant USAA, who he described as quite knowledgeable about the technology.\n\nHowever, he voiced his belief that the participating firms all likely understand bitcoin far better than the community might expect, and that they may be aware of crypto 2.0-type applications.\n\nHe said:\n\n""We have this impression that these are big dumb companies, but they’re not. They read the research and they read the blog posts and they get it.""\n\nWilson argued that the participation of big-brand investors, however, is likely to send positive signals to the wider financial world while benefitting the team at Coinbase.\n\n“Whatever the reaction was, BBVA is a very innovative bank, USAA is also very innovative, and they have a tradition of embracing new things,” he added. “They’re good partners.”\n\nBenefits for bitcoin\n\nThroughout the conversation, Wilson also expressed his desire that Coinbase will use the funding in ways that could help expand the entire bitcoin ecosystem, becoming more global, mobile, open and secure, all goals echoed by CEO Brian Armstrong.\n\nIn particular, Wilson indicated that he wants Coinbase to focus on its APIs and software development kits (SDKs) so that developers can build on its growing platform.\n\n“Let’s just say that Coinbase has 10 million wallets all over the world, then developers could build applications for ticketing or lending,” he said. “[Becoming more] open is another very important piece of it.”\n\nWilson also sought to frame Coinbase’s success as integral to the world, speaking positively about the future he believes the company can help unlock.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n“It would be a very different world than the one we live in today.""\n\nFred Wilson image via Wikipedia\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A bunch of screenshots and forum conversations with unknown persons, claimed to be Ulbricht, is pretty flimsy evidence from where I sit.\n\nSilk Road Trial Hinges on a Stolen Laptop\n\nAt the criminal trial in New York, FBI agent Tom Kiernan was on the stand, and an item called “Government Exhibit 200” was added to the proceedings. This item happened to be a Samsung 700z laptop in plastic wrap. Kiernan told prosecutor, Timothy Howard, that this was indeed the computer he and two other FBI agents conspired to steal from Ross Ulbricht in October 2013, just before Silk Road was shut down by authorities. This laptop was so important to their case, that they stole it from the public library desk he was sitting at in San Francisco’s Glen Park section. Ulbricht was still a free man on that day, just being followed by the three FBI agents, who were ready to get more evidence against him, by any means necessary. This is how they conspired to steal the intended target.\n\nOf the three-person team, a male and female agent were going to pose as two people at the library in a large quarrel, close enough to distract Ulbricht. Upon distracting Ulbricht, the third agent would grab the open computer and gave it to Kiernan, an FBI, computer specialist. Without allowing it to go idle, and thus become encrypted, he took photographs, went through the browser history, and ultimately handed it off to another agent, who then “imaged” the hard drive.\n\nAlso read: Silk Road And Ross Ulbricht, The Trial Continues\n\nEvidenced discovered by an illegal search or seizure is inadmissible in court under what is known as the “exclusionary rule”. This means that even if the murder weapon was found and can conclusively establish that a suspect killed someone if it was obtained through an illegal search and seizure, then it is generally not admissible.\n\nThere is also a related rule of law known as the “fruit of the poisonous tree”. This rule states that evidence obtained through illegally obtained searches should also be excluded. This means that if the police illegally search a house and find a map of the locations of the suspect’s drug stashes, the map, and the evidence at the locations, is also inadmissible because the search was illegal.\n\nLaw and order in the United States are becoming sketchy at best, as far as the ability of the authorities to ethically meter out justice without becoming criminals themselves. Maybe what I know about the law fits into a thimble, but a gang of federal agents faking a fight, and stealing the laptop of someone who is innocent until proven guilty doesn’t sound like justice to me. How the thieves can turn around and submit this stolen merchandise as evidence in a court of law sounds criminal in nature to me.\n\nHow is this different than “identity theft” or and other similar act? Because someone with a badge did it, its ok? When the authorities become the criminals themselves, is justice at all possible?\n\nImage provided by CNet & Ugly Duckling House.\n\nHow about you? Should this laptop and any “evidence” within, be legally used against Ross Ulbricht or any person in a court of law?

You have the option to supply your Bitcoin wallet address to the app and after you’ve played the game long enough, you get a small amount sent to your wallet (for me it was 100 bits). Over the course of a few days, playing the game off and on, I received about 1,500 bits in total – and then it stopped. The game supposedly only pays out based off of how many bits are in the community pot, and it had run dry. There was a wallet address that you are able to send bits to in order to keep the game able to pay out other plays as well. The question is, should the plays of the game be required to keep the pot filled with bits, or should the game creator do so?\n\nThe game I was playing is available on the iPhone platform and is called SaruTobi. If you remember playing internet games in the new millenium you may remember a game called “Kitten Cannon” and this game is basically that. You have a monkey on a vine that swings around and until you release. The monkey flies through the air and you collect coins (labeled as Bitcoin) that you can then use to purchase power-ups. The coins you collect have no weight on whether or not you will receive any Bitcoin.\n\nThe game itself is rather fun and does help pass time, but the questions it brings up now is do you think that this is a good way to spread the word of Bitcoins usefulness? Also, the game did have an advertisement on the top right of the screen, but if you earn coins in the game you can disable the advertisement. If there is an advertisement, do you think the owner should provide a portion of that revenue back into the community pot that supplies players with bits of Bitcoin? How do you think that Bitcoin will alter the way games are played in the future? There are a few games available for Android users as well that pay you to play.\n\nIn the past there have been apps available to users that will supply them with small amounts of money (usually under $1 US) for viewing advertisements. These apps usually require a minimum level to be reached prior to paying and then pay via Paypal. Do you think we will begin to see an increase in apps that pay in Bitcoin? How do you feel about apps like these? Leave your opinion in the comment section below.', ""Bitcoin has made some big gains over the last year in business-to-consumer transactions, with many large retailers such as Microsoft, Dell and Overstock now accepting it as a means of payment.\n\nHowever, the digital currency hasn’t made that kind of splash in the business-to-business (B2B) world.\n\nLate last year, core developer Jeff Garzik tweeted, musing that it would be nice if someone could put a bit of research into the subject.\n\nWould love to see a case study for using #bitcoin as a replacement for B2B wire transfers and payments. Honest, not fluff. Pros & cons. — Jeff Garzik (@jgarzik) December 11, 2014\n\nBitcoin-based transfers between businesses would fix an inefficient system. Wire transfers, which are one of the most common ways for businesses to pay each other, are expensive, because banks have to deal with each other directly for each individual transfer, and they can sometimes take days to process.\n\nAn alternative, Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers, are aggregated into batches by a third party, meaning that banks don’t have to deal with them individually. This often makes them cheaper, but slower. There’s always a trade-off somewhere.\n\nCompanies that choose to trade in bitcoin, though, can eliminate fees charged by banks for moving money around the world, because the participants are going outside of the banking system altogether.\n\nIt can also be far faster to trade in bitcoin, as even getting six confirmations on the blockchain will still take little more than an hour.\n\nFurthermore, it’s ostensibly easy to make a B2B transaction in bitcoin. If you’re buying, say, car parts from a supplier in another country, then you simply send them the bitcoin, and they send you the parts.\n\nBig savings\n\nThis is exactly what Tomcar does. One of the few companies to try bitcoin-based B2B transactions, this Australian car manufacturer makes significant savings in the process, according to managing director David Brim.\n\n“Using bitcoin on business transactions allows us to save on banking charges and international exchange rate costs,” said Brim, adding that Tomcar has saved tens of thousands by paying suppliers in bitcoin.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Brim gave a figure of $20,000 saved, although he claimed $50,000 in the video below:\n\nIt isn’t quite that easy, though. For one thing, not a lot of businesses accept bitcoin.\n\n“We only really have three suppliers who accept bitcoin,” said Brim, who tries to persuade his trading partners to use it as much as possible. “Two are based in Israel, and one in Taiwan. We purchase maybe only 2% of the Tomcar vehicle’s parts from these suppliers.”\n\nHe tries to make these transactions as much like an electronic bank transfer as possible. Simplicity is important. He has strong supplier agreements, and uses standard commercial terms to ensure that he is protected.\n\nBrim also does his best to escape from the dangers of capital gains taxes, which companies can incur in some jurisdictions if they hold onto the bitcoins that receive.\n\n“We do not hold bitcoin. We only use it as a payment method. We pay all taxes involved in any payments. I have always said that if we are to use bitcoin, we would never hedge or hold the currency as an investment,” said Brim.\n\nHe added:\n\n“We make the world’s best all-terrain vehicle, and we need to concentrate on that. Investing in currency, even bitcoin, is not what we do.”\n\nTo this end, he uses bitcoin merchant accounts to transfer payments. This also keeps him outside the banking system when making bitcoin transactions. Australian banks, like many others, are extremely conservative when it comes to bitcoin, he said.\n\nOne reason that it might be difficult for banks to get involved is that bitcoin isn’t considered a currency in many jurisdictions. Instead, it’s often seen as some other kind of asset.\n\nFor Henryk Dabrowski, though, that’s a bonus.\n\nNavigating currency exchange controls\n\nDabrowski is CEO of investment and management services holding company Alternet. His firm invests in companies that focus on advanced payments technologies and got into the digital currency space in 2014.\n\nAlternet subsidiary Alternet Payment Solutions recently partnered with BitPay to resell its business-to-consumer merchant account services, but Dabrowski has another venture up his sleeve: targeting B2B transactions using cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe latest venture targets countries with exchange controls that make it difficult for them to trade in foreign currencies. There are tens of these countries, often but not always in emerging economies, ranging from Argentina to Pakistan.\n\n“In Pakistan you can’t exchange rupees for anything else. You have to register yourself as an import company and you only have a certain quota,” he said, explaining that this is a way for the country to control its currency reserves.\n\nThese exchange controls can throttle international trade for businesses operating there. Ideally, they’d simply trade in bitcoin, but if foreign trading parties don’t accept it, then they need an intermediary. That’s where Dabrowski's service comes in.\n\nHow it works\n\nA customer in a B2B transaction in a country with foreign exchange controls – say, Pakistan – might want to buy parts from another country (Germany, say). The Pakistani company has rupees, and can’t buy euros from its local financial institutions. But the German firm will only accept Euros, not rupees.\n\nThe Pakistani firm approaches an Alternet subsidiary in Panama and buys bitcoins (which Dabrowski calls a 'digital asset') with its rupees.\n\n“The digital asset is then pledged as a currency to a loan in a foreign currency. And through that loan the foreign currency is how the company pays suppliers,” Dabrowski said.\n\nIn seven days, the loan defaults, and the bitcoins become the property of the Panamanian subsidiary, which can then sell them to regain its position.\n\nThe subsidiary works with a local banking partner to send the foreign currency to the supplier, using the digital currency as an asset linked to the fiat currency for anti money laundering purposes.\n\nThis means that the transaction isn't bitcoin all the way. Instead, it's a transaction that goes through the conventional banking system, but which uses bitcoin as a means to provide customers with access to foreign currency services that they wouldn't normally have.\n\nIf Alternet’s system can be made to work, he believes that it will free up companies in a variety of exchange-controlled countries to trade legally with those in other countries. It’s one rather complex example of how a B2B transaction involving bitcoin can look, although this one has a specific target audience.\n\nAre we likely to see bitcoin used as a mainstream medium of exchange between businesses in 2015? Probably not. But the use cases are there, and, in time, the business world may see fit to give bitcoin B2B services a try.\n\nWorld Button image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The core team includes de Haas, lead developer and founder of Haasonline; marketing manager Phil Donsbach; developer Lander Vanhaverbeke; and support specialist Theo Goodman.\n\nCost: Haasbot 2.0 is available in three different pricing tiers. Haasonline uses a subscription-based model. A three-month 'Beginner' licence costs 0.22 BTC, the 'Simple' licence is priced at 0.30 BTC, while the full 'Advanced' licence costs 0.45 BTC. The company also offers 6- and 12-month licences. Payments in fiat currency are not accepted.\n\nProduct Launched: January 2015.\n\nSummary: Haasbot 2.0 provides users with a wide range of choice, with three basic bots, all of which feature a number of different presets, as well as a range of user-customisable options. Depending on the licence, users can set up several interconnected bots capable of performing a range of different functions.\n\nCoinDesk rating: 4.5/5\n\nThe Basics\n\nWhile Haasbot is a relatively familiar name in some circles, bitcoin users may not have heard of it. It is a niche software solution for bitcoin traders rather than mainstream users, a professional tool for people that know what they are doing.\n\nIn its latest incarnation, Haasbot 2.0 offers a number of new features, but the big news is the entirely reworked user interface (UI) that should improve user experience over 1.x versions.\n\nThe basic functionality remains unchanged and Haasbot 2.0 still offers three types of standard bot: Trade, Arbitrage and Maximum Order. Trade bots are supported by a range of technical analysis indicators, safeties and insurances. The 2.0 update also brings customisable Script bots and other new features.\n\nThe Advanced licence enables users to create an unlimited number of bots and use all available safeties, insurances and indicators. The Simple licence is limited to three bots from each category for a total of nine bots, while the Beginner licence supports two bots from each category, allowing the user to create a total of six bots. Beginner and Simple licences also offer a limited choice of safeties, indicators and insurances on trade bots.\n\nThe team also claims transparency and prides itself on providing support via forums and a wiki page, as well as integrating some features requested by users.\n\nHaasbot 2.0 currently supports Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTC-e, CEX-IO, Cryptsy, Huobi, Kraken and a few smaller exchanges. Users can track prices on one exchange while trading on another, so if they spot a trend on one particular exchange, they can gain ahead start on another exchange.\n\nUsing the service\n\nAs mentioned, Haasbot 2.0 is not aimed at mainstream bitcoin users. The target audience is people who understand the markets and trading. However, this does not mean that Haasbot 2.0 is not user-friendly and cannot be used by hobby traders. As always the caveat is, do not trade with any coins you are not prepared to lose.\n\nWith three different licence tiers, three standard bot classes and a practically countless combinations of safeties, indicators and insurances that can be assigned to individual bots, getting to grips with Haasbot 2.0 could be problematic for users who have no previous experience with trading bots.\n\nThis is one of the reasons Haasonline maintains a very comprehensive wiki, complete with detailed guides, walkthroughs and other useful resources. There’s also a support forum for user inquiries, suggestions and more. The sheer number of options also means that we could not test every scenario in any sensible timeframe. Haasbot 2.0 is a professional trading tool and we simply could not cover the full functionality.\n\nInstallation and setup\n\nThe new 2.0 update brings a complete overhaul of the UI and an all-new web server interface. The installation process is relatively straightforward and the developers recommend Google’s Chrome browser as the best platform for the Haasbot Trade Server. Once that is installed, it is just a matter of entering licence and API information and you are ready to start trading.\n\nWith Haasbot 2.0, you easily keep track of all active bots and set up various notifications, straight from your browser, using a convenient dashboard. The only downside is that mobile functionality remains limited, so if you happen to be on the road you may have a harder time managing your bots.\n\nCreating trade bots, order bots and arbitrage bots is just as easy, it’s a one-click affair, but setting them up and tweaking all the parameters may take a while. Effectively, it all depends on what you want your bots to do – and when.\n\nScript bots are an entirely new feature introduced with Haasbot 2.0 and they are completely customisable and programmable in C#. They do, however, require a bit more time and knowledge to set up.\n\nThe latest update also brings a new price comparison feature, along with a white server framework for more accurate and faster price tracking.\n\nHaasbot 2.0 also comes with three new trade indicators: Elliot prediction, Fibonacci and IchiClouds, and is now available in English, German and Dutch languages.\n\nTypes of available bots\n\nHaasbot 2.0 offers three basic bot categories, configurable out of the box.\n\nTrade bots use a combination of indicators, safeties and insurances selected by the user to act as a buy or sell signal. The signal is cross-referenced with the current position and the trade is executed if all criteria are met. The bot will also consider the insurances created by the user, as well as safeties.\n\nThe most frequently used safeties are Dynamic Drop Loss and Static Drop Loss, which monitor prices for a sudden drop and trigger trades based on thresholds set by the user.\n\nA wide range of indicators is available, depending on the type of licence you choose. The most popular insurance is ‘Overcome Fees’, which ensures that trades are not executed unless the profit is greater than the fee.\n\nOrder bots operate depending on a number of conditions or pre-orders. A number of conditions can be combined in a single bot to create customised bots, allowing traders to emulate support and resistance levels.\n\nArbitrage bots can be employed on exchanges with multiple currency pairs, allowing the trader to generate a profit through exchange rate variations. In such a scenario, the bot is configured to use a base currency and then monitors price differences related to the base currency, allowing automated low-risk transactions.\n\nConfiguring bots\n\nThere are myriad ways to configure bots, allowing users to create very elaborate strategies, such as virtually interconnecting bots and setting up bots that can automatically take over from less profitable bots in certain scenarios. Of course, this involves significant planning, along with some level of trial and error.\n\n'Backtesting' allows users to see how their trade bots would have performed in action over the last 3 hours to 32 weeks, using historic market data. This feature speeds up the setup and helps remove ambiguities. Backtesting can be used on trading and arbitrage bots.\n\nUsers can set various indicators to execute buys or sells, or both. Trade signals can be reversed as well. In case your strategy loses money in backtesting, you can simply reverse the indicators and proceed. Script indicators allow traders with programming skills to devise their own completely customised algorithms.\n\nTo set up an arbitrage bot, the user needs to select a base currency in which profits are to be generated. The bot works with three user-selected currency pairs, such as USD/BTC, USD/LTC and BTC/LTC. In periods of high volatility, the bot will be able to find price differences between the pairs and execute trades. The bot automatically takes fees into considerations and will not trade unless profit covers the fee.\n\nOrder bots are basically pre-programmed bots allowing users to create buy and sell orders in advance, based on price thresholds. They can also be strung together to form dependencies. Order bots can be dependent on other order bots, ensuring that the most profitable trade is executed. For example, if you have a trade bot set up to sell at $250 and another bot set up to sell at $265, the first bot won’t take action if the second bot is able to sell at a higher price.\n\nLet the trading begin\n\nSince we are dealing with an automated service, there is really not much to report. Everything works as advertised and the end result depends on what you decide to do with your bots.\n\nAs you can see, the CoinDesk test bot worked, but did not make a fortune for a number of reasons (limited time and unrealistic setup to name two).\n\nPerhaps the biggest change with the Haasbot 2.0 update is the browser interface, which I found user-friendly and relatively simple to use, given the complexity of the suite. It also adds a bit more functionality, allowing users to control their bots with less effort.\n\nIt is also possible to use a VPS (virtual private server) in order to access the interface on mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and notebooks.\n\nPros\n\nThe new web interface is user-friendly and looks good. It is a big improvement over Haasbot 1.x in terms of appearance and functionality.\n\nWide range of indicators and addition of new ones in 2.0 update, along with new features like script bots.\n\nHaasonline tends to keep things personal and is in constant touch with users via its support forum, wiki and direct contact. Developers routinely add features and tweak the platform based on community input, so if you come up with a good idea, the team may well implement it.\n\nCons\n\nWhile the web interface is accessible from mobile devices via VPS, support for mobile devices leaves much to be desired. The company is considering developing iOS and Android apps that would provide vital notifications and allow users to shut down bots on the go.\n\nHaasbot 2.0 licences are not cheap. Though this is subjective – depending on how serious you are about trading and how much you are willing to invest, the licences could be either too expensive or a negligible cost considering your potential gains. Once again, this is a specialised platform and it’s not designed for inexperienced users.\n\nCompetitors\n\nThere are already a few bitcoin trading bots on the market. Some are free, some offer free trial periods, while others use a subscription-based model. CoinDesk took a closer look at a number of trading bots in a feature last June.\n\nThese include Butter Bot, CryptoTrader and Acacia Trading, but it’s hard to directly compare the platforms due to a number of reasons. Be that as it may, Haasbot 2.0 tends to offer more functionality than competing solutions, but at a premium price.\n\nConclusion\n\nHaasbot 2.0 is more than an incremental update, as it offers a number of new features, namely the all-new web interface. The platform also offers three basic types of bots, along with new script bots that can be customised.\n\nThe extensive choice of options, safeties, indicators and interactions between the bots allows traders to devise elaborate trading strategies, provided they choose to buy the Advanced licence with no limitations. The downside is the cost of the top-tier licence, but cheaper licences are available too, which means you don’t have to spend much to try the service for a limited time.\n\nIt should also be noted that Haasonline was forced to increase pricing due to the low price of bitcoin. Remember, the company does not accept fiat payments.\n\nHowever, for serious traders used to trading dozens or hundreds of coins on a regular basis, the Advanced licence at 0.45 BTC for three months probably doesn’t sound like much.\n\nBottom line – Haasonline raised the bar with the Haasbot 2.0 update and the competition has some catching up to do.\n\nDisclaimer: This article represents the experience of the reviewer and is not a recommendation or financial advice. Please do your own extensive research before considering investing any funds."", ""The Federal Reserve Note (FRN), also called the “U.S. dollar,” was dubbed the worst investment of the last century. As predicted, 2015 has seen the continued fall in value of the currency that was supposed to fuel an advanced economy. In the last 3 days alone, it has lost 12% in value against Bitcoin. Even more shocking is that in the last 100 years, a whopping 98 % of the FRN's purchasing power was lost.\n\nTrust-Model vs. Decentralized Model\n\nThe ominous shadow on the future of the FRN is that it relies on trust – trust in a wholly centralized and largely unaccountable institution. Federal Reserve employees must be trusted not only to be resistant to corruption, but to be perfect fortune-tellers to boot.\n\nWhat does that mean? With the power to create literally an unlimited number of new dollars, Federal Reserve employees ask that people trust them to magically calculate what the “ideal” amount of money should be. They assert that people should trust they won't play favorites in distributing that new money. They state people should believe that Federal Reserve employees, and not individual lenders and borrowers themselves, somehow know what the perfect interest rate should be.\n\nThe basis of trusting unaccountable people has become the Federal Reserve Note’s achilles’ heel. The design of the dollar dictates that the first people to receive newly-created money – which happens to be big banks and the U.S. state – get to spend or lend that money before it loses its value to inflation.\n\nThis is what has caused the massive wealth redistribution over the last hundred years from the average working person to the political and banking elite.\n\nAs the Federal Reserve Note’s value has dropped, the economics of the Internet lead to the creation of the trustless, math-based and totally transparent monies called cryptocurrency (of which Bitcoin is only one).\n\nWhere Does Value Really Come From?\n\nThe Federal Reserve Note's value relies purely on the belief of the people who buy and sell it. There is no “inherent value,” but rather legal tender laws that threaten to imprison people who create or trade in competing currencies (which explains why the creator of Bitcoin chose to remain anonymous). In other words, the Federal Reserve Note is literal monopoly money.\n\nOnce the supposed virtue of monopolization is questioned, the FRN becomes unsustainable. Even if the price of the FRN doesn’t go to zero, the chances that the dollar-using community convinces those who've tried cryptocurrencies that the FRN really represents the future will become extremely unlikely.\n\nFor the time being, the FRN still has enough devotees who believe that the currency is viable long-term, and still claim the crown as the future enabler of physical and digital commerce. However, even they are having their doubts that this grand political experiment may have run its course.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

He sees the infrastructure that has been built up around it as amazing with endless opportunities. He told CCN that BitFury is making some moves to be able to make transaction processing (mining) more efficient and widespread beyond just making faster chips.\n\nIn a move that goes along with that goal, BitFury is acquiring Allied Control; a top immersion cooling company based in Hong Kong. This move will allow BitFury to expand everywhere, not just in cold climates, and be able to take advantage of the low power costs and existing infrastructure in many more areas of the world. The sheer density they will be able to pack their chips into using immersion cooling tech and refining it even further to meet their needs, will be massive.\n\nAlso Read: Interview With BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov: New Bitcoin ASIC Chips On the Horizon\n\nValery Vavilov – BitFury CEO:\n\nWe are very excited about Allied Control and its founders joining our team. This acquisition will enable us to substantially increase energy efficiency of our data centers and speed up deployment of our new ASIC chip allowing to lower overall capital expenditure. In addition, it provides an opportunity for us to enter new markets such as HPC, using the experience of the Allied Control team. The use of immersion cooling will provide BitFury with flexibility when choosing locations for our data centers.\n\nAllied Control uses 2 phase immersion cooling. They also use 3M™ Technology Partner for Novec™ Engineered fluids. Here is some relevant information on how it works.\n\nTwo-phase immersion thermal management is a viable technology for meeting the power density and energy efficiency needs of the high-performance computing market. Power densities up to 100 times higher than a typical air cooled server have been cooled this way with efficiency superior to direct water cooling.\n\nIn a two-phase immersion cooled system, electronic components are submerged in a bath of dielectric heat transfer liquids, which are much better heat conductors than air, water or oil. With their various low boiling points ( 49°C vs. 100°C in water), the fluids boil on the surface of heat generating components, and rising vapor passively takes care of heat transfer. In contrast to submersion oil cooling, liquids are clean, environmentally friendly and non-flammable. No heat sinks, pumps, and jets are required to keep hardware cool. Circulation happens passively by the natural process of evaporation and without spending any extra energy. It is this simplicity that eliminates conventional cooling hardware and results in better cooling efficiency. Compared to traditional air, water or oil cooling, this passive process results in the use of much less energy. Two-phase immersion cooling is 4000 times more efficient at removing heat from chips than the air.\n\nBitFury Next Gen ASICs\n\nSo for BitFury to be able to acquire this technology, the manufacturer will allow them to take current and next gen transaction processing ASICs and drive them to more efficient speeds. Valery hinted the next generation chip was close but would not say how close or divulge theoretical specs yet but will let me know as soon as he is ready. Valery and BitFury have a careful approach to Bitcoin, and he sees himself and his company as part of the stewardship of Bitcoin and the technology that underlies it. This news is an exciting development.\n\nKar-Wing Lau, VP of Operations at Allied Control commented:\n\nWe are very glad to partner with BitFury and to help them further increase the efficiency of their operations. Both blockchain technology and two-phase immersion cooling are very disruptive in nature. Passive two-phase immersion cooling is especially promising for blockchain transaction processors as it addresses their need for flexibility and rapid deployment while allowing to take full advantage of higher hardware power density. BitFury, with its focus on efficiency, renewable energy and innovation, is the perfect match for this technology.\n\nBig things are coming from BitFury and with Allied Control another step has been made in the progress of expanding and making transaction processing more efficient in more locations. Valery and BitFury have more coming, and we will bring it to you.\n\nWhat do you think BitFury’s acquisition of Allied Control 2 phase immersion means for their bitcoin transaction processing data centers and their future plans?\n\nImages from BitFury.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Para el 6:\n\n\n\nTiempo al tiempo, pq´no....es otra forma de pago, incluso mucho mejor q las q ahora tenemos, tanto por su rapidez, en minutos o segundos dependiendo de la moneda d q se trate, seguridad y coste nulo o ínfimo.

Roughly a year ago I wrote a post entitled “This Industry Is Completely Ridiculous.” Since then, as you probably already know, our world has gotten even more surreal. If anything the ridiculousness is accelerating. It’s like the tech industry is subject to a Moore’s Law of weird.\n\nConsider: within the last month, Burning Man announced it was accepting Bitcoin donations, while Xapo declared it was (in some unspecified way) securing its Bitcoin wallets on satellites.

Did you know there’s an app with an ‘Incest Prevention Alarm,’ to help keep you from sleeping with a cousin? Again, not making this up. Did you know there are two emoji-only social networks? No wonder SF has a new game show: “App Or Crap?”\n\nThe Bay Area’s tech boom is now reverberating through the rest of the world, too. People out there are literally raising millions of dollars for “startups about nothing.” A few brave pioneers are even daring to believe that the New Tech is No Tech. Following the failure of the Everest app, its cofounder’s new startup produces a wearable with…nothing; absolutely nothing at all. It’s just a two-tone silicone wristband. Is it satire? Is it real? Is there any difference any more? Who knows? Yo’s Law, baby. Maybe it’ll be this century’s Pet Rock.\n\nOf course, behind the weirdness you find all the tedious “Uber for” and “Instagram for” ripoffs. But who can blame them, when the once-eye-popping $1 billion that Zuck paid for Instagram looks like petty cash next to the $35 billion it’s worth now? Meanwhile, on the other side of the hockey stick, once-mighty BlackBerry has been reduced to the industry equivalent of a sideshow clown, begging governments to legally require companies to make apps for its so-called ecosystem. WTF.\n\nThe ridiculousness has metastasized. It is no longer confined within the bubble of the tech industry. Consider the Sony hack. A brief recap: somebody logic-bombed Sony back to the twentieth century. The FBI declared: “North Korea!” The security community responded: “Your so-called evidence is incredibly unconvincing!” And we we were all faced with the hilariously terrifying possibility that technology is now moving so fast that the US government can no longer distinguish a rogue state with nuclear weapons from a gang of trolls in it for the lulz.\n\nYou might think the USA’s array of fearsome Three-Letter Agencies, and their ongoing campaign to surveil the entire planet, ought to give them the benefit of the doubt…but the more we learn about those TLAs, the more they seem like bloated hives of overfunded incompetents trying to overcome their intellectual shortcomings with brute force and billions of dollars.

Instead the rest of the world will become more like the tech industry–in all its awkward, chaotic, unpredictable, surreal, unequal, infuriating, zany glory.\n\nThis is not necessarily a pure unalloyed good. But I submit that all the dystopic doomsayers out there are overlooking one extremely important factor, the one single thing that I can guarantee you about the future…which is that it will be extremely weird. And I for one believe this is an extraordinarily good thing, because rampant weirdness is a sign that our collective sphere of possibilities has expanded.\n\nSo bring on our ongoing infection of the rest of the world; bring on the ridiculous, the surreal, and the strange. Because if there’s one thing the tech industry is good at, it’s turning apparently ridiculous notions into overpowering reality–and if there’s one thing the rest of the world needs, it’s that kind of expanded sense of what may be possible.']"
01/25/2015,"['The virtual currency bitcoin is getting a very real boost on Monday with the opening of the first licensed U.S. exchange.\n\nCoinbase Inc., a startup backed by $106 million from the New York Stock Exchange, banks and venture-capital firms, said its exchange will offer greater security for individuals and institutions to trade bitcoin and monitor real-time pricing of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe exchange could bring needed legitimacy...', 'Adam Ludwin co-founded Chain.com, a bitcoin developer platform. Prior to Chain, Adam was a venture investor in companies including Vine, Slack, Kik, and Paperless Post. In this article, he addresses the distinction between privacy and anonymity in bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is often described as a way to transact anonymously. But just how anonymous is it?\n\nFirst off, it is useful to draw a basic distinction between anonymity and privacy in the context of financial transactions. We will call a transaction “anonymous” if no one knows who you are. We will call a transaction “private” if what you purchased, and for what amount, are unknown.\n\nLet’s draw a simple matrix and locate different kinds of financial transactions within it:\n\nCash or barter are the most intrinsically private and anonymous means of transacting.\n\nIn the opposite corner are transactions which are neither anonymous nor private. This includes, say, campaign contributions over a certain amount. We may also include in this quadrant credit card transactions: although not public knowledge like a campaign contribution, your identity is nevertheless connected to every purchase you make, and this information is available to the merchant, credit card network, issuing bank, and — if subpoenaed — law enforcement.\n\nCertain financial transactions are private but not anonymous; for example, the donor wall at the local art museum, which identifies the names of donors but not the amounts donated.\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, is anonymous but not private: identities are nowhere recorded in the bitcoin protocol itself, but every transaction performed with bitcoin is visible on the distributed electronic public ledger known as the block chain.\n\nThe anonymity provided by bitcoin is at once a point of attraction and a challenge for financial regulation. As the pace of adoption of the currency grows and as it comes under scrutiny by the legal and financial systems, particularly with regard to compliance with applicable anti-money laundering (AML) statutes and know-your-customer (KYC) controls, its true level of anonymity will become an increasingly closely studied subject.\n\nFor many users of bitcoin, who access the currency through one of the popular online wallet or exchange services, their participation at the outset entails linking their personal identity to their bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin for these users is effectively no more anonymous than a bank account, although this loss of anonymity takes place at the point of entry into the currency and is not a feature of the bitcoin protocol itself.\n\nFor those who wish to take advantage of bitcoin’s intrinsic anonymity, they must find an alternative entry point, such as acquiring bitcoin in a private transaction, as compensation for goods or services rendered, or as a reward for mining. Subsequent bitcoin transactions can then be anonymous, since real-world identities are not recorded on the block chain ledger: the only identifying information recorded there are the bitcoin addresses, whose corresponding private keys are held by the owners as proof of ownership.\n\nMaintaining one’s anonymity from this point forward, however, is in no way guaranteed: even supposing one manages to acquire bitcoins without giving up personal information, one’s real-world identity can still be discovered in the course of transacting bitcoin within the network. Let’s look at how this can happen.\n\nBroadly speaking, deanonymization techniques pursue one of two complementary approaches, having to do with the public nature of the transaction ledger and with the possibility of exposing the IP addresses of the computers originating the transactions.\n\nAnonymity and the transaction ledger\n\nThere is no upper limit to the number of addresses a bitcoin holder can control. All one’s bitcoins can be stored in a single address, or they can be dispersed into dozens or even thousands of addresses. Meanwhile, good practice recommends (though does not enforce) that every address be used only once: any amount left over in change from a transaction should not be kept in the old address but moved to a new one. This proliferation of addresses designedly obscures which ones are controlled by a single individual at a single point in time, and makes it difficult to track the flow of funds controlled by that individual over time.\n\nIt is possible, however, to leverage the perfect transparency of the transaction ledger to reveal spending patterns in the block chain that allow bitcoin addresses to be bundled by user. This is the domain of transaction graph analysis.\n\nTransaction graph analysis\n\nTransaction graph analysis applies a few tricks and some educated guesswork to link the approximately 57 million transactions taking place between 62 million addresses to a subset of the unique holders of bitcoin. It then allows transactional relationships between these bitcoin holders to be mapped.\n\nOne basic technique in transaction graph analysis involves transactions with more than one input address. By definition these inputs are controlled by the same person — and if either address appears elsewhere in the block chain then the associated transactions can also be linked to the same person.\n\nA second technique takes advantage of the “good practice” mentioned above: if exactly one of the output addresses in a transaction has never appeared in the block chain before, then it is a good bet that the new address is the change address.\n\nA third technique looks at the numerical precision of the amounts involved in a transaction. For example, in a transaction generating two outputs corresponding to two new bitcoin addresses, where one of the outputs is, say, 3 BTC and the other is 2.12791 BTC, then it is a very good bet that the first number corresponds to the recipient and the second number to the change. What is the chance, after all, that the change should happen to end up in such a neat figure? The address originating the transaction can thus be linked to the change address with a high degree of confidence. The same analysis can be repeated after converting to major currencies such as USD to find “whole numbers” that might otherwise be hidden in bitcoin-denominated transactions and that enable sender to be distinguished from receiver.\n\nAddress deanonymization using these methods can be thwarted by sending bitcoins through so-called mixers or tumblers, which take a set of bitcoins and returns another set of the same value (minus a processing fee) with different addresses and transaction histories, thus effectively “laundering” the coins. But these services come with serious caveats. Users must hand over control of their bitcoins and trust the service to return them. Transaction graph analysis can identify use of a mixing service and flag the user as potentially suspicious. Mixers do not work well for very large sums, unless others with similarly large sums happen to be mixing their bitcoins at the same time. Some mixing services do not work as advertised and can be reverse-engineered. Services that operate legally must keep detailed records of how the coins were mixed, which could later be hacked or subpoenaed. And the new bitcoins received might themselves be tainted by illegal activity.\n\nSeeding the transaction graph\n\nTransaction graph analysis by itself only reveals the imprint of individual agency in the block chain; it does not reveal any real-world identities. For this it is necessary to refer to information not contained in the block chain.\n\nA great deal of information linking bitcoin addresses to their identities is available publicly. Businesses accepting bitcoin may place a QR code near a cash register or on a website. Others may announce their bitcoin address through services such as blockchain.info, which identifies the owners of thousands of addresses. Thousands more addresses can be harvested from public email forums when individuals include personal bitcoin addresses in signature lines to posts. This partial knowledge of identities can be combined with the transaction graph to deanonymize a swath of the transaction ledger.\n\nRetroactive geolocation is one potential consequence of this deanonymization. Suppose a café accepts bitcoin and uses a fixed address for their over-the-counter transactions. If you are a patron of that establishment, and your bitcoin addresses become associated with your identity, then someone can easily call forth from the block chain a partial record of your personal whereabouts over time.\n\nConversely, suppose someone wanted to link your identity to your bitcoin address, and you happen to mention that you visited the same café for lunch that day. Someone can look up the address used by the café, find the subset of transactions on that address taking place over the lunch hour, and filter the results by price to exclude transactions involving just a hot drink. Perhaps a bit more information on what you had for lunch, and a look at the café’s menu, and the chances of making a successful match are high.\n\nPerfect knowledge of the transaction ledger also means that any additional information discovered at a later date can be retroactively applied, allowing further pieces of the identity puzzle to be dropped into place at any time. A single disclosure of identity, even years in the future, and every transaction on that address and those connected to it is compromised.\n\nIP address anonymity\n\nA complementary source of potentially deanonymizing information is available to every computer that participates in the decentralized transaction network by hosting a bitcoin node. This information is the set of IP addresses of the computers that announce new bitcoin transactions.\n\nAt the time of writing there are around 6,500 nodes accepting inbound connections from other nodes, and perhaps ten times that number which don’t accept requests for connections. The former maintain connections to several dozen peers on average, while the latter typically have eight peers. Both kinds of nodes generate transactions. Transaction propagation through the node network begins with the computer that first broadcasts the event to its peers, which then forward the event to their peers in an information cascade that usually reaches every node in the network within a few seconds.\n\nThe simple observation which can be exploited is that, provided one can find a way to connect to a majority of nodes, perhaps by controlling a coordinated sub-network of nodes spread over many devices, the very first node to relay a transaction is on average the originator of that transaction. The risk increases if multiple transactions are relayed from the same IP address. While a small random delay is baked into the transaction propagation protocol to help preserve the anonymity of the original sender, with the proper techniques enough signal is available through the noise to make a positive identification in many cases. And while use of a TOR router offers some measure of protection against IP address discovery, it exposes the user to other potential attacks.\n\nAn example of this kind of IP address deanonymization made public is blockchain.info, which discloses the IP address of the first node to report a transaction to its servers. The information is only as reliable as the web site’s node connectivity: with a declared 800–900 connected nodes at the time of writing, it is probably not enough to reliably pinpoint the originating IP in all cases.\n\nSo…\n\nHow anonymous is bitcoin today? Average users should be aware that it is certainly less anonymous than cash. Meanwhile, dedicated users willing to go through extraordinary lengths can find ways to acquire and use bitcoin anonymously, but the open nature of the transaction ledger and other unknowns leave open the possibility that identities and activities once considered perfectly secure may be revealed at some point down the road.\n\nWhat about the future? As bitcoin adoption continues to increase, it is not out of the question that a technology arms race could arise between anonymizers and deanonymizers: on the one hand, increasingly sophisticated data mining schemes will be developed, possibly combining transaction graph analysis with IP address discovery, to trace the movement of funds in the block chain between individuals and across borders. On the other, improved techniques will be devised to better conceal individual identity and activity.\n\nHere there are many unknowns. Will the core bitcoin code be modified to further protect anonymity or to facilitate regulation? Will bitcoin mixing services become pervasive and secure? Will transaction graph analysis reach a degree of sophistication where most user activities can be easily traced? Will an alternative digital currency or side chain arise which tilts the balance for or against anonymity? All we can say with certainty is that bitcoin is still in its infancy and that existing thinking and tools in the area of anonymity are still primitive. We have seen only the opening moves; the endgame has yet to be played.\n\nThis backgrounder was originally published by Coin Center, a non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies such as bitcoin.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Bitfinex CSO Phil Potter came under a cloud this past Thursday, after an interview in which he seemed to be admitting to insider trading at Bitfinex. The interview was contained in a podcast that was posted on Vocaroo, an online voice recording service.\n\nIn the voice recording, Mr. Potter can be heard strenuously clarifying that he was a Bitcoin investor. He adds that he had not been involved in actual trading on his Bitfinex trading platform saying that such an action would be “highly inappropriate”.\n\nBitfinex has come out in defense for Mr. Potter. Josh Rossi VP for Business Development issued a statement posted on Reddit defending Mr. Potter’s trading at Bitfinex. In the statement, he explained that Phil Potter had been managing a fund that dealt in cryptocurrencies prior to his arrival at Bitfinex. He had ceased trading once he took up his role at Bitfinex.\n\nHe also explained that the management team at Bitfinex regularly monitored the accounts of company officials, an action that was designed to create “checks and balances” on each member of the team. In the statement, Josh Rossi added that all of Mr. Potter’s orders had been limit orders, a kind of order that among other things is designed to cut losses should the asset start experiencing a bear run.\n\nSeveral comments on this statement indicated that the community was not convinced. For example, Reddit username Waldoraj asked about how they would go ensuring that employees at Bitfinex do not use anonymous wallets. Others felt that in the interests of transparency, it would be best if company officials would trade their Bitcoin assets on other exchanges so as to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nConflicts of Interest – How They Arise\n\nThe conflict of interest would arise in a couple of ways regarding Bitfinex and other bitcoin exchanges. One of them has to do with what are called margin calls. A margin call occurs when the amount posted in a margin account falls below the minimum margin requirements for a particular asset class, in this case the asset being Bitcoin. In the above example, as a senior company official at Bitfinex, Mr. Potter would have access to information on Bitfinex clients. He knows their holdings, including any hidden orders. Such information gives him a competitive advantage over other traders.\n\nTo illustrate how the conflict of interest could arise, think back to the recent collapse in Bitcoin’s price against the US dollar. When the price begins to drop slightly, all a manipulative trader will do is initiate margin calls. Several margin calls would trigger a rush to sell bitcoins thus enabling him become a Bitcoin whale by purchasing as many bitcoins as possible for as low a price as he can.\n\nAnother conflict of interest would arise from stop loss orders. Normally, stop loss orders are used by traders to hedge against loss or position in a security. Stop loss orders work well because they take the emotions out of trading decisions, and they can be employed by an investor who has to attend to other matters or may be physically away for some extended time period.\n\nA manipulative trader could easily use insider information to distort the price of an asset such as Bitcoin. Such a trader could begin to issue margin calls and stop loss orders thus enabling him to collect as many coins, in other words, build a long position. The goal is to buy as many coins as possible for the least possible price, which eventually turns him into a Bitcoin whale.\n\nBitcoin Whales\n\nAs Bitcoin’s current capitalization is still low, the effect of a whale on Bitcoin’s price can be markedly pronounced. As previously explained, a whale’s goal in the early stages would be to keep the prices low so as to enable them buy more bitcoins. With insider trading, this becomes easy to do, as all a whale would have to do is to trigger as many stop loss orders as possible in an effort to entice others investors dump their own bitcoins.\n\nThe effect of this is to avail more coins on the market for an even lower price, after which the whale would attempt to inject capital so as to increase the prices. The goal of such pumping is to inflate the value of the coins to as high a price as possible before letting the market correct itself by sending the bitcoins back to the value where they are meant to be.\n\nIn as much as Bitfinex has cleared the air on this, there is, however, a real need of ensuring transparency in crypto trading. This will become even more important as Bitcoin continues to mature as a viable digital asset.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitstamp\'s recent hacking woes suggest that security in the bitcoin world seems to be getting worse, rather than better. Whether it\'s down to external attacks, or internal irregularities as alleged at Mt Gox, it\'s clear that something has to change.\n\nWhen bitcoin wallet Blockchain experienced its own security problems in December, decentralised cryptography expert Emin Gün Sirer noted that the standard security practices among technology companies would not stand up in the bitcoin world.\n\nToo much was at stake, he said. Social media companies may hold pictures of your pets, but your bitcoin account holds something more valuable. It seems reasonable that the cryptocurrency world should be held to a higher level of account than, say, Twitter (although a hacked Twitter account can still have pretty devastating results).\n\n""We certainly need better security practices, as we have seen from the constant stream of spectacular failures of bitcoin exchanges,"" he told CoinDesk more recently. ""These services have been failing at the rate of one major failure every two months, leaving many distraught people in their paths.""\n\nSo, if we accept that companies holding real live funds for customers should have higher security standards, what should those standards be?\n\nAdvice from bankers\n\nIf bitcoin companies shouldn\'t be looking to the general technology sector for their security, then they\'ll need to look elsewhere. Perhaps the banking industry might be able to offer some sage advice. Banks have been valiantly trying to stop hackers from pilfering their customers\' data for years. Could bitcoin companies learn something from them? Given JP Morgan Chase\'s recent losses, maybe not.\n\nThe JP Morgan Chase hack was undeniably bad, but there\'s a key difference between that and a hacked bitcoin account. JP Morgan customers lost personal information, but not money. If a hacker targets your bitcoin account, your funds are gone.\n\nFormer digital forensics investigator Michael Perklin is president of the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4), which has developed a certification for cryptocurrency professionals. He argues that bitcoin companies must go beyond even banks in terms of security:\n\n""If someone breaks into a bank and someone edits their database to say \'Now I have a million dollars than I have before,\' or they wire transfer funds out of the bank to go to another bank – then all of that is traceable and reversible.""\n\nConversely, he argued that on-blockchain bitcoin transactions aren\'t, as some exchanges and other bitcoin services have found to their cost.\n\n""With bitcoin, once you\'ve taken the keys and transferred them someone else, there\'s no way to get them back without relying on traditional law enforcement,"" he warned.\n\nIf bitcoin companies can\'t look to Silicon Valley or to banks, then where can they look? Perhaps to themselves.\n\n""It\'s high time for the exchanges to realize that they are in this together, that a perception that bitcoin is insecure hurts the entire ecosystem, and it\'s in their best interest to establish practices (like the use of strong databases, multisig wallets, real-time proof of reserves, and trustworthy computing) for the entire industry,"" Sirer said.\n\nBetter software needed\n\nOne area where exchanges could improve is software development, argues Charles Hoskinson, cryptography expert and former CEO of Ethereum, who is now working on an educational project around cryptocurrency.\n\n""Exchanges need to clean up their acts and create a standards body for proof of solvency, along with smart contracts to regulate behaviour and restore trust, he said, adding that many exchanges are startups with limited resources. ""That\'s the other problem, which is that the software is pretty crummy.""\n\nBuilding secure software is difficult. In 2003, Microsoft froze its entire development cycle for months, and effectively retrained its developers from the ground up to write more secure code. It began outlawing functions in different software libraries, forbidding its developers to use them.\n\nMicrosoft even designed a whole process, called the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), to create software that was bulletproof (or, at the very least, contained fewer holes than the average lump of Gruyere).\n\nSoftware development alone is not enough, however (and in Bitstamp\'s case, it isn\'t entirely clear where the vulnerability lay that allowed hackers to steal bitcoins from the company). There are other issues to consider, too, including infrastructure management. Elements such as change control and security patching are crucial for the operation of a secure environment.\n\nInternal processes must also get better, experts say. Performing suitable background checks on personnel responsible for keys is one example, argued Perklin.\n\nThe good news is that some of these secure processes can be hard-wired into the technology used. Multi-signature technology is a good example. You may vet your senior executives responsible for accessing private keys, but having a system that requires several of them to authenticate a transaction would help to minimise, if not entirely eliminate, the risk of corruption and blackmail.\n\nTaking care of business\n\nIf they don\'t get their heads around this, the danger for organisations holding peoples\' cryptocurrencies is that they end up having someone else regulate it for them. Too many big thefts may draw interest from policymakers who may take matters into their own hands.\n\n""If there are enough customer complaints, regulators might just be compelled to step in with their usual heavy-handed approach,"" said Gun Sirer, adding that he hoped the industry pulls itself together before that happens. ""I\'m in favour of getting the industry to clean up its own act.""\n\nThere\'s certainly enough money floating into the bitcoin community to pay for some grown-up programmers. CoinDesk\'s State of Bitcoin report in January documented venture capital investments in bitcoin reaching $433m, and $335m of that happened in 2014. That\'s a lot of salaries for technical security leads.\n\nSearch image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""The latest bitcoin price crash has started a new debate on the long-term viability of many aspects of the mining industry.\n\nNotably, one of the first segments to take a hit in the days leading up to the crash was cloud mining – services that lease out hashing power from usually large-scale mining enterprises based in data centres.\n\nOn January 12th CEX.io announced it would suspend cloud mining activities due to low prices. In a blog post, the company said cloud mining is simply no longer profitable.\n\nNumber of bitcoin miners goes down\n\nOver the weekend, Organ Ofcorti published a comprehensive analysis of weekly bitcoin network statistics.\n\nThe anonymous miner and blockchain data analyst pointed out that GHash.io reported a drop from 34,000 active user accounts to 6,000 user accounts on January 13th. The number then went down to 5,500 users. The drop was attributed to CEX.io’s decision to pull the plug on cloud mining operations.\n\nAs a result, the estimated number of bitcoin miners plummeted by almost 30,000 in a matter of days. However, this does not mean the hash rate went down. Following the crash, the hash rate recovered and returned to peak levels in less than a week, after hitting a low of 229,513,534 GH/s on 14th January.\n\nOfcorti shared his thoughts on the demise of CEX.io cloud mining with CoinDesk, concluding that the effect of the drop is negligible:\n\n“I think cloud mining has had negligible effect on the network hash rate. Take for example GHash.io (the only cloud mining entity sufficiently transparent to prove this data) – their recent ceasing of cloud mining removed about 28,500 user accounts – but had almost no effect on their hash rate.”\n\nOfcorti went on to explain that cloud mining tends to appeal to those who could not afford to invest a lot in order to purchase and run miners.\n\n“Further, there are just too few cloud mining block makers and making too few blocks. If they were having a significant on the network, they'd have a larger share of it,” said Ofcorti.\n\nDigital currency consultant and entrepreneur Jonathan Levin described cloud mining as a good concept with some drawbacks:\n\n“The cloud mining market seems like a good idea in theory ensuring that the ownership of the hashing power is distributed among many participants. However the market suffers from a lack of transparency and operational risk which currently the industry from pricing the contracts efficiently.”\n\nHash rate to plateau or decrease at current prices\n\nWhile the hash rate recovered shortly after the crash, long-term projections are difficult to make at this point. Four months ago CoinDesk examined a number of problems facing the mining industry in the long run, concluding that growth rates at the time were unsustainable. Assumptions were based on substantially higher miner revenues and bitcoin prices.\n\nSince then, things have taken a turn for the worse. Although difficulty and hash rate have continued to go up, the price of bitcoin has more than halved. The cost of ASIC development, tape-outs and manufacturing is bound to go up as chipmakers transition to new FinFET manufacturing nodes.\n\n“Assuming no significant [order of magnitude] improvements in chip cost and efficiency, at the current price the hash rate will either plateau or decrease slowly. Most of the smaller players and those without low-cost electricity will leave the network once it's clear they won't recoup any losses,” said Ofcorti.\n\nOfcorti shares Levin's concerns about the possible centralisation of hash power:\n\n“I think the main problem caused by the low BTC price is increased centralisation.”\n\nWhile the question of centralisation looms over the industry, there are a number of influential industry leaders who consider the matter overblown. Gavin Andresen, the Bitcoin Foundation’s chief scientist, downplayed the risks at the annual Web Summit three months ago.\n\nAndresen argued that centralisation is likely to occur in waves and therefore can be rolled back. He said economies of scale are currently forcing companies to create huge mining farms, but as mining ASICs become commoditised, the trend could reverse and the industry could decentralise again.\n\nMining companies remain bullish\n\nHowever, a number of mining companies remain bullish and see a lot of potential in cloud mining. The pre-order business model is all but gone – as the market for individual and hobbyist sales dries up, cloud mining may be the only way for mining companies to move forward.\n\nAt the same time, some companies are exiting the cloud mining market, with CEX.io being the biggest player to pull out so far. Last week cloud mining service ZeroHash also announced that it may be forced to shut down its service due to unprofitability.\n\nHardware makers are feeling the pinch too. CoinTerra is the latest bitcoin mining hardware company to default. Earlier this year, the company found itself unable to service its debts and last week it was forced to default on roughly $4.25m of secured notes. CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar said the industry downturn was unpredictable, both in terms of price and mining difficulty.\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, some mining companies are still expanding, attracting investors and clients. They are not bucking the trend – they are simply doing what has to be done to maintain competitiveness at a time of crisis.\n\nHash rate charts via Organ Ofcorti\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Amateur- und Hobby-Trader werden diese Software aber sicherlich auch ganz nützlich finden.\n\nWer steckt dahinter: Haasbot entstand aus einem privaten Projekt von Stephan Haas heraus. Haas und sein Team haben sich jedoch dazu entschieden die Software auch für den kommerziellen Handel freizugeben. Das Team besteht aus Haas selbst, dem Marketing Manager Phil Donsbach, dem Entwickler Lander Vanhaverbeke und dem Supporter Thei Goodman.\n\nKosten: Den Haasbot gibt es in drei verschiedenen Preisvarianten. Eine dreimonatige “Beginner” Lizenz kostet 0,22 BTC, die “Simple” Lizenz schlägt mit 0,30 BTC zu Buche und die “Advanced” Vollversion kostet 0,45 BTC. Eine Zahlung in Fiat-Währungen (USD, EUR etc.) ist nicht möglich.\n\nVerfügbare Sprachen: Englisch, Deutsch, Niederländisch\n\nRelease Datum: Januar 2015.\n\nZusammenfasung: Der Haasbot 2.0 bietet seinen Nutzer ein breites Spektrum an Einstellungsmöglichkeiten. Gleich zu Beginn kann man zwischen drei verschiedenen Basis-Bots mit unterschiedlichen Vorabeinstellungen wählen. Abhängig von der Lizenz können zudem diverse weitere Bots hinzugefügt werden.\n\n\n\nCoinDesk Rating: 4.5/5\n\nDie Basis\n\n\n\nAuch wenn der Name Haasbot für einige unter uns bereits vertraut klingen mag, haben manche Bitcoiner vielleicht noch nie von der Software gehört. Bei Haasbot 2.0 handelt es sich mehr um eine Nischensoftware die sich eher an den professionellen Trader als an den Mainstream richtet.\n\nHaasbot 2.0 bietet im Vergleich zu der Vorgängerversion Haasbot 1.0 viele neue Features und vor allem am User-Interface (Arbeitsoberfläche) hat sich so einiges getan. Diese ist nun viel benutzerfreundlicher gestaltet und ermöglicht auch dem Laien eine problemlose Navigation.\n\nAn den Basisfunktionen hat sich nichts geändert und es gibt auch weiterhin drei verschiedenen Basis-Bots:\n\nTrade, Arbitrage und Maximum Order. Trade-Bots handeln im Sinne vieler verschiedener technischen Analysen, Sicherheiten und Absicherungen. Mit dem Update auf Version 2.0 kann man nun auch weitere Script-Bots selbst konfigurieren und aus einem Pool diversen neuen Features wählen.\n\nMit der “Advanced Lizenz” kann der Nutzer unendlich viele Bots erstellen und alle Sicherheiten, Absicherungen und Indikatoren Nutzen. Die “Simple Lizenz” ist auf drei Bots aus jeder Kategorie beschränkt, somit insgesamt neun Bots. Die “Beginner Lizenz” hingegen erlaubt es dem Nutzer nur zwei Bots aus einer jeden Kategorie zu erstellen (insgesamt sechs Bots). Auch die Auswahl von Sicherheiten, Indikatoren und Absicherungen ist bei der Simple und Beginner Lizenz beschränkt.\n\nDerzeit unterstützt Haasbot 2.0 die Bitcoin-Börsen Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTC-e, CEX-IO, Cryptsy, Huobi, Kraken und einige kleinere Börsen. Das bietet dem Nutzer die Möglichkeit die Trends auf verschiedenen Börsen zu beobachten und entsprechend vorausschauen zu handeln.\n\nAnwendung\n\nWie bereits erwähnt richtet sich Haasbot 2.0 an den Mainstream. Die Zielgruppe der Software sind Trader die den Markt bereits verstehen und genau wissen was sie tun. Das bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass Haasbot für den Hobby-Trader unverständlich und somit zu kompliziert ist. Man sollte sich jedoch IMMER dem Risiko bewusst sein, einen Totalverlust zu erleiden!\n\nMit drei verschiedenen Lizenzen, drei unterschiedlichen Standart-Bots und nahezu unendlich vielen Kombinationen von Sicherheiten, Indikatoren und Absicherungen mag ein Laie ohne jegliche Bot Erfahrung jedoch schnell den Überblick verlieren.Haasonline will dieser Problematik jedoch mit einem ausführlichen Wiki, der detaillierte Guidlines beinhaltet, zuvorkommen. Zudem bietet Haasonline ein Support-Forum für Nutzeranfragen und hilfreichen Tipps.\n\nAufgrund der Vielzahl an Einstellungsmöglichkeiten konnten nicht alle Szenarien getestet werden.\n\nInstallation und Setup\n\nDas 2.0 Update hat dem Haasbot einen komplett neuen Look und eine leicht verständliche Benutzeroberfläche verpasst. Der Installationsprozess der web-basierenden Anwendung ist relativ einfach und geht schnell vonstatten. Die Entwickler empfehlen Google Chrome als Standardbrowser für die Nutzung des Bots. Nach der Installation muss der Bot nur noch mit der jeweiligen Lizenz und den jeweiligen API Informationen gefüttert werden. Danach kann es auch schon losgehen.\n\nDas übersichtliche Dashboard bietet dem Nutzer in der Browseroberfläche einen guten Überblick über die aktiven Bots und alle möglichen Einstellungen. Nur die mobile Ansicht lässt noch etwas zu wünschen übrig.\n\nDie Auswahl der Trade-, Order- und Arbitrage Bots ist ganz einfach, das Setup der Bots jedoch kann, abhängig von der gewünschten Einstellung, eine ganze Weile in Anspruch nehmen.\n\nEin komplett neues Feature der 2.0 Version sind die Script-Bots die allesamt in C# programmierbar sind. Das Setup dieser Bots benötigt verständlicherweise etwas mehr Zeit und Wissen.\n\nDer Haasbot 2.0 ist in drei Sprachen (Englisch, Deutsch und Niederländisch) verfügbar und enthält neue Indikatoren wie Elliot Prediction, Fibonacci und IchiClouds.\n\n3 verschiedene Bots\n\n\n\nWie bereits erwähnt bietet Haasbot 2.0 drei verschiedene Arten von vorkonfigurierten Bots.\n\nDer Trade-Bot agiert basierend auf die vom Nutzer zuvor vorkonfigurierten Kombination von Indikatoren, Sicherheiten uns Absicherungen auf die Kauf- bzw- Verkaufssignale. Mit diversen Querverweisen wird dann der Kauf bzw. Verkauf ausgeführt. Zudem fragt der Bot vor dem Kauf bzw. Verkauf die zuvor festgelegten Sicherheiten und Absicherung ab.\n\nDie am häufigsten verwendeten Sicherungen sind Dynamic Drop Losses und Static Drop Losses, welche den Preis beobachten und bei einem plötzlichem Kursabfall und das Überschreiten eines zuvor festgelegten Schwellenwertes sofort einen Trade ausführen.\n\nBasierend auf der Lizenz stehen dem Nutzer zudem eine Reihe von verschiedenen Indikatoren zur Verfügung. Der beliebteste Indikator ist der “Overcome Fee” Indikator. Dieser tätigt nur einen Trade, wenn der Profit über den Gebühren liegt.\n\nOrder Bots handeln basierend auf zuvor festgelegte Kondition und Aufträge. Order-Bots können maßgeschneidert und nach den Wünschen des Users eingerichtet werden. Somit hat der Nutzer die Möglichkeit verschiedene Konditionen in nur einem Bot zu vereinen und eine Unterstützung oder einen Widerstand zu emulieren.\n\nArbitrage-Bots können auf Bitcoin-Börsen angewendet werden die den Handel in verschiedenen Währungen erlauben. Damit kann der Nutzer sogar Profit aus Währungsschwankungen schlagen. In einem solchen Szenario wird der Bot auf eine bestimmte Basis-Währung konfiguriert und sobald er eine Währungsschwankung feststellt, wird ein entsprechender Trade ausgeführt. Dies sind auch sogenannte Low-Risk Trades (niedriges Risiko).\n\nKonfiguration der Bots\n\n\n\nEs gibt unzählige Möglichkeiten die Bots zu konfigurieren. Dies erlaubt dem Nutzer sehr ausgefeilte Strategien anzuwenden und die Bots zusammen agieren zu lassen. Ein Bot kann beispielsweise automatisch übernehmen, wenn ein anderer Bot nicht profitabel genug handelt. Eine solche Strategie bedarf natürlich einer genauen Planung.\n\nMithilfe der “Backtesting Funktion” (Simulation) kann sich der Nutzer anschauen, wie der jeweilige Bot, basierend auf historischen Marktdaten, in den letzten 3 Stunden- 32 Wochen agiert hätte. Diese Funktion vereinfacht die Konfiguration erheblich und beugt Fehlern vor. Die Backtesting-Funktion kann an Trading- und Arbitrage-Bots angewendet werden.\n\nPro\n\nDas neue Interface ist sehr benutzerfreundlich gestaltet und sieht im Vergleich zur Version 1.0 sehr anschaulich aus\n\nEine breite Palette neuer Indikatoren und Features. Zudem überzeugen die neuen Script-Bots\n\nHaasonline ist sehr bemüht seine Nutzer zu unterstützen und bietet deshalb ein sehr gute Support Forum sowie die Möglichkeit das Team direkt zu kontaktieren. Das Team reagiert schnell auf neue Vorschläge und Anregungen. Solltest du also einen guten Ratschlag haben wird das Team diesen schnell umsetzen und ggf. programmieren.\n\nKontra', 'Miles Johnson, Hedge Fund Correspondent JANUARY 25, 2015 1 Bill Ackman, the US activist investor, has moved into the ranks of the top 20 most successful hedge fund managers of all time after his Pershing Square vehicle made a series of big bets on American stocks last year. In an otherwise muted year for the industry, Mr Ackman’s 33 per cent return in 2014 placed him at number 19 of the top 20 funds based on the total amount of dollar net profits they have made for investors after fees. Mr Ackman was the only new entrant into the annual list compiled by LCH Investments, the fund of hedge funds run by the Edmond de Rothschild group, having generated $11.6bn in returns since Pershing Square was launched in 2004. Pershing Square is the youngest fund on the list, and Mr Ackman, 48, the youngest manager. According to LCH the top 20 managers generated $25.2bn in profits net of fees in 2014, while the wider hedge fund industry made net gains of $71bn. George Soros, the veteran hedge fund manager famed for betting against the Bank of England’s attempts to defend the pound on “Black Wednesday” in 1992, remained top of the all-time list with his Quantum fund having reclaimed pole position from Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater the previous year. Mr Soros, who closed his $30.9bn fund to non-family members at the end of 2011, has largely delegated investment responsibilities to Scott Bessent, its chief operating officer, but remains involved in decision making. Quantum generated $2.3bn in returns last year, according to the data. Elsewhere there were few changes at the top of the list in a year that saw most large hedge funds generate muted returns. John Paulson, who shot into the ranks of the best performing managers after making large wagers against the US subprime market before 2008, was the biggest loser in cash terms, suffering a $1.9bn net loss. In spite of this he remains at number three on the list. Moving up were Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking, gaining two places on 2013 to climb from ninth to seventh, and the veteran Paul Singer’s Elliott Associates, which rose from 12th to ninth. Alan Howard, the British billionaire co-founder of Brevan Howard, slipped from eighth to 12th after his $24bn Master Fund posted its first loss since its launch in 2003. The LCH list does not include hedge funds driven by computer models, such as Renaissance Technologies. Rick Sopher, chairman of LCH, said that while overall hedge fund returns were lower than previous years the large sums made by some managers showed that profits could be made in a low interest rate environment. “Some of the more talented managers made exceptionally good investments which generated exceptionally strong gains for their investors,” he said.', 'Sally Davies JANUARY 25, 2015 11 Andreessen Horowitz, the US venture capital group that was an early backer of Facebook, has won a competitive bidding process to invest in TransferWise, the money transfer group that is one of London’s most high-profile tech start-ups, in a sign of growing international interest in the UK’s burgeoning financial technology sector. The $58m investment prices the company at close to $1bn, according to people familiar with the deal. Ben Horowitz, a founding partner of Andreessen Horowitz and an ardent advocate of financial innovations such as bitcoin, led the group’s rare investment in a European company and will take a seat on TransferWise’s board — his first for a start-up in the region. The news marks part of a turnround in the tech sector in the UK and Europe, which Silicon Valley investors have tended to shun in preference for the plentiful fast-growing companies on their home turf. Recently, they have shown an increasing appetite to invest across the Atlantic, with European start-up investments involving US groups estimated to be about $3.5bn in 2014, up from just $808m in 2010, according to Go4Venture Advisers, an analyst group. Google launched a venture arm last year with a mandate to invest $100m a year in European companies. Start-ups such as Shazam, a London-based music app, Adyen, a payments processor based in Amsterdam, and TrueCaller, a Swedish phonebook app, have all raised significant sums in the last six months. The investment in TransferWise comes after the Financial Times reported that Sequoia, another Silicon Valley venture capital group, was leading talks over a $50m funding round in November that would value TransferWise close to $1bn. The choice of investor came down largely to who would give the company a more generous valuation, according to people familiar with the deal. Four-year-old TransferWise was founded by early employees of Skype, and lets people send money to one another internationally in 39 countries. The company said it would use the funds to expand into the US, Germany and Australia. Its target market is young professionals and small companies sending salaries across borders — marking it out from some of other London-based money transfer start-ups such as WorldRemit and Azimo, that are more focused on migrant remittances. TransferWise said in November that its business was growing 20 to 30 per cent a month, although in a blog post due to be published on Monday Mr Horowitz indicated that figure was now 15 to 20 per cent a month. Other investors in the latest funding round included existing backers such as Richard Branson, Index Ventures, Valar Ventures and IA Ventures. Andreessen Horowitz’s investment “shows how ripe financial services are for disruption”, said Taavet Hinrikus, TransferWise’s chief executive and co-founder. “For too long, legacy providers’ dominance of the market has allowed consumers to be hoodwinked into paying huge hidden charges for services as basic as currency exchange.” Financial technology is becoming increasingly competitive, with start-ups unburdened by old legacy systems using cloud computing and mobile technology to undercut traditional players on pricing, as well as providing a more personalised experience. The sector is particularly strong in the UK, partly thanks to a favourable timezone, a less fragmented regulatory environment than in the US, and the presence of many global banks. But in the race for market share TransferWise also encountered problems. It fell foul of the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority last year over an advertising campaign claiming that banks were “secretly overcharging” consumers on international transfers, after which the company rebranded itself.']"
01/26/2015,"['Looks who’s gone legit.\n\nBitcoin, the cybercurrency beset by controversy and wild swings in its value, got a huge boost on Monday when the first regulated US exchange opened.\n\nThe exchange, San Francisco-based Coinbase, is licensed to do business in 25 states — including New York and California.\n\nWhile accounts at Coinbase and other bitcoin exchanges are not backed by any government of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, said his company has insurance — which could offer traders some assurance against loss.\n\nThe opening Coinbase appears to have given the cybercurrency a life — raising prices about 16.6 percent Monday morning to $296.63. Bitcoin has hit a 21-month low of $152.40 on Jan. 14. It had been valued at $1,200 in late 2013.\n\nCoinbase, which already has 2.2 million accounts, or wallets, on file and 40,000 businesses that use it, is backed by plenty of legit investors. It has raised a total of $106 million — including a $75 million round this month that counted the New York Stock Exchange and USAA among its backers.\n\n“To have an organized exchange that has the backing of thoughtful venture capitalists and investors addresses one of the main problems with bitcoin: its extreme volatility,” Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke University finance professor who has studied cryptocurrencies, told the Wall Street Journal.\n\n“Bitcoin has been sorely in need of something like this,” he said.\n\nBitcoin fans were rocked in recent month by the collapse of the Japan-based Mt. Gox exchange — that led to the loss of $500 million — and a security breach at Bitstamp, a Slovenia-based exchange.\n\nCoinbase will profit by taking a 0.25 percent cut of most transactions. It will not take a cut of any transaction for two months as it looks to attract business.\n\nWhile Coinbase is the first regulated US exchange, it is expected to get some competition soon. The Winklevoss twins — Tyler and Cameron — hope to get their exchange, called Gemini, up and running soon, they said in a blog post Jan. 23.', 'Getty Images Cameron, left, and Tyler Winklevoss\n\nHOLLYWOOD, FLA. (MarketWatch) — If you have gold in your portfolio, you should consider investing in bitcoin, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss said Monday.\n\nThe twin brothers are working to launch an ETF that provides exposure to the volatile virtual currency.\n\n“If you look at the GLD gold ETF, basically that’s our model,” Tyler Winklevoss said. The SPDR Gold Trust GLD, -0.20% is one of the world’s largest exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe twins went even further in praising bitcoin, saying it’s an improvement on gold. They said its advantages include being more durable and more portable, plus the brothers emphasized that a fixed supply of bitcoin is built into the rules for the digital currency.\n\nThe comments came as the Winklevoss twins headlined a session Monday at ETF.com’s Inside ETFs conference in Hollywood, Fla. The brothers, who are still best known for their legal fight with Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook’s FB, +0.05% origins, have turned into significant players in the world of bitcoin.\n\nTyler Winklevoss said a bitcoin ETF will let investors offload how they keep track of their bitcoin assets to professionals — just like how you wouldn’t keep gold at home.\n\nThe twins also argued that bitcoin’s checkered reputation is the result of a few bad actors. Tyler Winklevoss criticized media coverage, saying “don’t listen to the linkbait, flashy headlines” but instead really dig into what it is.\n\nBitcoin endured a rough 2014, when its price dropped by about two-thirds, according to a CoinDesk price index, which factors in data from several bitcoin exchanges.\n\nRead more: A Bitcoin price plunge and worries about ‘mining’ activity\n\nBeyond aiming to introduce the Winklevoss Bitcoint Trust, an ETF that’s expected to have the ticker COIN, the Winklevoss twins are working to create the first regulated Bitcoin exchange in the U.S., as a New York Times article said last week.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin basics — What you need to know', ""Security firms McAfee Labs and Symantec have issued warnings that a type of bitcoin-demanding ransomware, CTB-Locker, is now being propagated through spam campaigns.\n\nThe malware, the name of which stands for 'Curve Tor Bitcoin Locker', was first identified last year. However, the spam distribution approach appears to be a relatively new development.\n\nMcAfee published its latest advisory last week, describing CTB-Locker as a form of ransomware that encrypts files on the target computer. Anecdotal evidence suggests .jpg image files are a frequent target. The victim then has to pay a ransom to have the files decrypted.\n\nSymantec said in a recent blog that the process of dealing with crypto malware is “particularly nasty to deal with”.\n\nHow it works\n\nUpon installation, CTB-Locker injects malicious code into the 'svchost.exe' file, creating a scheduled task for moving and encrypting files.\n\nThe malware encrypts the compromised files using elliptical curve encryption, which appears to be equivalent to RSA encryption with a 3,072-bit key.\n\nOnce the encryption is complete, the user is informed of the attack through a pop-up ransom message.\n\nThe message displays a 96-hour countdown. If the user does not pay the bitcoin ransom within 96 hours, the decryption key is destroyed and the files remain permanently encrypted.\n\nThe pop-up allows the user to see the list of encrypted files, along with information on how to make a payment and get the decryption code.\n\nDetection, infection and propagation vectors\n\nMcAfee detects CTB-Locker under three different names: BackDoor-FCKQ, Downloader-FAMV and Injector-FMZ. Symantec identifies the final payload as Trojan.Cryptolocker.E.\n\nThe malware is being propagated via spam campaigns, as a .zip archive stored within another .zip file. The zipped file contains the downloader for CTB-Locker.\n\nSo far, researchers have uncovered the following names used to store the downloader:\n\nmalformed.zip\n\nplenitude.zip\n\ninquires.zip\n\nsimoniac.zip\n\nfaltboat.zip\n\nincurably.zip\n\npayloads.zip\n\ndessiatine.zip\n\nAside from standard sound security practices (eg: not opening .zip files from untrusted sources), McAfee has published a number of recommendations to mitigate the threat using McAfee products.\n\nThe Symantec blog also offers useful information on CTB-Locker for users of Symantec security products.\n\nShould victims be unwilling or unable to pay the ransom, there is virtually no way of recovering the encrypted files. The best way of reducing the impact of a potential crypto ransomware attack is to backup valuable files on a regular basis.\n\nCTB-Locker pop-up image via Symantec; Spam image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

When we get there, the most likely outcome would be more downside and if this downside has a quick reversal above US$200 we might be able to finally call the low.\n\nTwo scenarios in order of higher probabilities\n\nBearish: Since our primary case is bullish, we are keeping an eye on the opposite move. The prices have hung around the US$190-200 zone long enough that we can consider that area our new line in the sand, a break of this zone at this point, will most likely retest the lows in the US$150 are.\n\nBullish: Unless some major EU bank collapses next week sending half of Europe’s wealth into bitcoins, don’t expect much and US$250 would be a nice start. A break above that takes us to the 50-day SMA quickly moving down but currently stands at US$290.\n\nAs you can see, the move was exactly as expected and in addition today added another 20% to the price of bitcoin at its high. At the moment it is very hard to make a call as to what we can expect next week. Nothing, not even Bitcoin goes up or down in price forever so we will need to make a call if we have just topped out, or are we just getting started.\n\nAs usual we will look at the weekly chart for a long-term picture\n\nLooking at this chart, it is obvious that the move over the last few weeks has been very strong. The candle two days ago is a borderline hammer, defined as a longer wick than body (just slightly shorter in this case) coming at the end of downtrend with high volume and price reversals.\n\nSo far so good and this move has just completed the pattern now that we are sitting above the US$275 mark. You will also notice an additional trend line coming from nowhere. This trend line is connecting the bottom points from late 2011 to early 2013. It shows us that we are perhaps right where we should be historically and this recent move might have been the overshoot and capitulation some were calling for.\n\nFundamentals & News\n\nAs usual we present 3 good roundups for those too busy to keep up with it all:\n\nCoinTelegraph Weekly Roundup by Armand Tanzarian\n\nBitcoin News Roundup by Bitsmith on TheCoinsman\n\nWeekly News Roundup by Brave New Coin\n\nThe big news this week was Coinbase on multiple fronts. Their partnership with PayPal’s BrainTree is finally ready for prime time. We also learned this week that they have secured a monster $75 Million funding round and as of 5 minutes of writing this, we know why they got so much money. Coinbase has just announced the plans to open the very first US regulated Bitcoin Exchange.\n\nAs most readers know this analyst is not a fan of Coinbase on several fronts. They are a US based company and in order for them to exist, they must comply with US laws of citizens’ financial surveillance and hence have full control of a user’s bitcoin account with an ability to freeze it or shut it down. This recent news should of course come off very positively in light of all the scams and issues with exchanges, but in the long run, the jury should still be out as to whether Bitcoin’s future should be fully dependent on the exchange with the most funding and law compliance.\n\nEveryone always complains about Bitcoin’s volatility yet somehow many are starting to cheer that Wall Street is about to get involved. Bitcoin is still trying to find its identity. For some reason, however, most people try to ignore the political implication that Bitcoin brings and that is going to be the 800 pound Gorilla that will not be regulated away. The current problem with all these exchanges is that they have independent pools of liquidity, which are not even that deep. If Wall Street is able to come up with one exchange to rule them all, what happens to bitcoins independence? We will just have to wait and see.\n\nIn the mean time, it is still advised for those looking to get their hands on some bitcoins to buy it using the one and only king of Black Market & Tax Evading practices: good old US Dollar Bills. One day when the function of Local Bitcoins is deemed illegal (for your own protection of course), you will be glad you have some bitcoins tucked away for a rainy day.\n\nIn other news, Bill Gates was on late night television promoting the idea and functionality of the Blockchain. Once again we will fall into the same predicament as any other US Company in terms of the difficulty to admit the existence of a surveillance state. While the majority of Americans (and even the World) have gotten used to it, the cracks in US global domination are starting to form and over the next few years more and more pushback from US citizens and international governments over the surveillance state will emerge.\n\nAlso, sticking with our global trend, the Greece elections are over and the leftist (or one step away from Communists) patty SYRIZA has won the election. It is very easy to see how they pulled it off; the vote was coming down to all the ‘extreme’ political groups since they are the only ones with the stones to stand up to the insane economic policies of the EU. This will have huge consequences as Greece will now look to exit the Euro (unless these new heads of state can be bribed with Euros like the last bunch, which is of course likely). This will also put pressure on the entire Eurozone as the confidence in the Euro (aka European Government) begins to weaken even further and there will be many regions looking to follow in Greece’s footsteps. This is of course very bullish for Bitcoin, which we will get into next time.\n\n“Bitcoin does not need a Wall Street operated exchange, it just needs people to realize what Governments are doing to them economically, EU citizens are on deck.” --Tone Vays\n\nEducation (Spotting a Trend Change)\n\nIdentifying a long-term trend change is not easy. It is even harder in Bitcoin as oppose to traditional markets like stocks and commodities. Most people use a 3-step process\n\nA break of a trend line A move in the direction of the original trend creating a higher low (or a lower high) A big move in the direction of the new trend creating a higher high (or lower low)\n\nThe reason we bring up this topic today is that Bitcoin might be on the verge of a major trend change. The move from the US$166 low to the US$298 high as of this writing definitely qualifies as a notable move breaking whatever downward momentum there was. We are now looking for Step 2.\n\nIn the current case in regards to Bitcoin, we would like to see a move down of about 50-100 points. Then Step 3 would be an even stronger move than what we just had in Step 1. So if we did just top out at US$298 and fall down to say US$250, we would keep an eye on a strong reversal taking us all the way to US$400.\n\nAlso if you look at the Daily Chart of Bitcoin below you will notice a perfect 1-2-3 pattern taking place from early October into Mid November giving the impression for a minute that the year long bear market in bitcoin is finally over. Let’s keep an eye on the trend reversal pattern this time, and based on volume, it definitely has a greater chance of success this time around.\n\nDaily Overview\n\nHere is the usual one-year look back using daily candles.\n\nToday’s move has really been something; we broke through the horizontal resistance of US$250 and flew all the way to US$300. Obviously this is a good thing. Based on the 1-2-3 reversal pattern above, we were initially looking to top out around US$250 then coming down to test the US$200 area and then attempting to reach YS$300.\n\nToday’s move has given the bullish case much more breathing room and we can now pull back from here to the US$250 area instead and then look for the move up. Trying to guess the top is also very dangerous because there is nothing stopping this momentum to keep going for an entire week.\n\nThe Short-Term view is a little less rosy. It is showing the price is a bit overbought and is currently stuck right at the 50-day Moving average. The RSI has also hit the bottom of our trend line. While the other momentum indicators have room to run up, it would really be ideal for everyone in the bitcoin space to take a breath and absorb the latest round of news.\n\nYou will also notice how this chart has an Ascending Triangle with the target already reached. This pattern was mentioned last week but was not drawn. However, those following on twitter @Tone_LLT would have noticed it on the chart the day after the article was published.\n\nConclusion\n\nLast week we turned short term bullish, but thanks to the move being this strong, we are now turning bullish across all time frames. However, we acknowledge the fact that nothing moves up or down forever and are keeping an eye on a pull back to US$250 or perhaps even a bit lower. Because of the highflying action, it is not advisable to short this move even if prices do what we expect. As hard as it is to say, for those that missed this move up, chasing higher now is not a wise decision and neither is trying to guess the top of this news driven rally looking to profit from a counter trend pull back. The US$260-$290 zone should be treated with care.\n\nTwo scenarios in order of higher probabilities:\n\nBearish: We over shot the 50-day SMA and at the moment sitting right at it at $US383, look for a pull back to US$250 or even as low as US$200 followed by a strong rally to new highs probably on the heels of some more good news or the breakup of the Eurozone.\n\nBullish: Bitcoin has a way of making fools out of experts and now that many have given up on the currency aspect of this technology, it is a perfect time to trick everyone again. There is open air to US$340 and it can get there in the blink of an eye just like the two-day crash two weeks ago. Above US$340 we are looking to hit the 200-day SMA currently at US$385.\n\nReference Point: Tuesday Jan 26 1:00 am ET, Bitfinex Price US$285\n\nPS: As a bonus please check out my appearance on the latest episode of Jeff Berwick’s Anarchast\n\nAbout the author\n\nTone Vays is a 10 year veteran of Wall Street working for the likes of JP Morgan Chase and Bear Sterns within their Asset Management divisions.

As the price is now above the $256 resistance line, we are likely to see it settle above $300 soon.\n\nBy observing the 1 hour Bitfinex BTC/USD charts from tradingview.com (look at the below chart), we can see how the price burst up to the $300 resistance line in a few hours, before declining again to around $263. This decline reflects the market’s attempt to correct the price as traders are selling to take their profits. By examining the 1 hour charts, we can spot many signals that denote that the bullish wave is still strong and is most probably going to continue. The 1 hour charts show a “stick sandwich” candle pattern (look at the 3 candles inside the blue cloud on the below chart), which means that the bearish wave that pulled the price down from $310 to around $264 is going to reverse during the next few hours.\n\nBitfinex Bitcoin Price Chart\n\nBy studying the 4 hour Bitfinex BTC/USD charts from tradingview.com and plotting the Vortex indicator (VI) on it (look at the below chart), we can still see the blue positive trend line is crossing over the red negative trend line which denotes that the bullish wave is likely to continue supported by the current buying strength of the market.\n\nAs the $256 resistance has already been broken and analysis reflects the current strength of the bullish wave, we are likely to see the price settling above $300 soon.\n\nCharts from Bitfinex.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The Ground Floor, Monday’s office space for young companies in Rosslyn, is now open. The Metro-accessible space features a 5,000-square-foot common area that includes a kitchen, lounge area, collaborative meeting spaces, and a stage for formal presentations.\n\nBitcoin is hard to explain. It’s a “crypto-currency,” and it’s worth real money — just like Euros and pesos are worth real dollars — but it’s completely digital.\n\nBlockchain Technology Consumer Solutions — or BTCS for short — was launched in 2013 as Bitcoin Shop, an ecommerce platform that allows users to buy goods with bitcoins and other digital currencies, like Dogecoin or Litecoin. Bitcoin Shop founders Michal Handerhan and Tim Sidie, now COO and lead developer respectively, had bought bitcoins but didn’t know how to spend them. So they created a way.\n\n“They got some immediate traction from consumers and offers to help fund the company,” Chief Marketing Officer Charlie Kiser told ARLnow.com from BTCS’ Rosslyn office this month.\n\nKiser, who has worked in startups for years in the D.C. area, joined the team along with now-CEO and Chairman Charles Allen. In February 2014, Bitcoin Shop went public, raising $1.875 million in its initial public offering.\n\n“Going public is not the most traditional route for startups,” Kiser admitted, “but it’s great in terms of speed and confidence in getting something closed. The idea was we could be one of the first publicly traded companies and we could accomplish some things in an industry with a lot of unknowns.”\n\nIn fact, most of the crypto-currency industry is unknown. While the currency exists, it’s not run by a bank or a government. It’s decentralized and far more unstable than currencies of developed countries. One bitcoin was worth more than $1,000 U.S. dollars near the end of 2013. Earlier this month, it was down below $200, and currently it’s hovering around $240.\n\nThere is no mint for bitcoins, either. Instead of a government printing them, they are “mined.” BTCS has a partnership with a bitcoin mining company in Israel. How are they mined? Anyone who wants a bitcoin must provide technological maintenance to the bitcoin system. The more bitcoins are circulating in the world, the more work a “miner” must do to get a bitcoin.\n\nBitcoins are exchanged and circulated on the “blockchain,” a “de-centralized peer-to-peer network” that works “effectively as a ledger system, reporting transaction,” Kiser says. Bitcoin was simply the first use of the block chain — many more are anticipated down the road.\n\nThat’s what intrigued Allen, a former engineer who was working at an investment bank before joining the company.\n\n“I said ‘this company’s going to be much bigger than e-commerce,'” Allen said. “Bitcoin is basically the Internet in 1995. Back then, no one thought it had any use, but the technology made sense. At the heart of bitcoin, the technology makes sense.”\n\nBTCS has invested in a company that produces bitcoin ATMs and is currently developing a bitcoin wallet, similar to Google Wallet, that will help its users keep their currency secure. BTCS hopes to be an access point for anyone to enter the crypto-currency space, in any form they choose.\n\n“We’re hoping we can be a market leader into giving access to the digital ecosystem,” Kiser said. “We’re hoping BTCS is where you come for all that.”\n\nUnlike other startups in emerging industries, BTCS has public investors to answer to. Investors can look to the four investments and one partnership BTCS has made as signs of progress toward market leader status. However, it’s simply too early to tell if these early gambles will pay off.\n\n“We are long on bitcoin and blockchain,” Kiser said, “and we are getting ready to enter the valley of innovation. Whether it’s the currency or the blockchain, there’s been enough invested to know in five years whether there will be a consumer case for it.”\n\nThrough its investments and products, BTCS hopes to be the ones to usher the new technology into that era, but it’s waiting on the industry to help.\n\n“There are all these problems that the technology solves,” Allen said. “They just haven’t been built yet.”"", ""So you want a job in Bitcoin? Or Dogecoin or Darkcoin or ATOMIC? Disclosure: as someone who has a job in cryptocurrency, I give you my congratulations. Joining the future sooner than later is a smart move, not to mention a thrill.\n\nBut how to get the job you want in such a new field? After navigating the process, these would be my top five tips from personal experience:\n\n1. Compile and scout crypto company websites\n\nMany (and maybe most) cryptocurrency companies' websites feature a “Jobs” or a “Join Us” page. To save time, use lists – like the partner list found on CoinTelegraph, Coinality or CoinHR and begin to canvas these websites for jobs postings.\n\nRemember to include the many different kinds of cryptocurrency operations out there: wallet providers, investment funds, software developers, consultants, exchanges, prediction markets, casinos, media outlets, etc.\n\n2. Check forums\n\nMany crypto operations have an official discussion forum. Bitcoin has one, Nxt has one, the SuperNet has one, etc. Often, these forums feature jobs listings. If a given forum doesn't yet feature a jobs section, join the forum and ask that one be added.\n\n3. Attend crypto meetups and conferences\n\nSometimes, the easiest way to get a job is just to be offered one in-person. And the only way to make that happen is to put yourself in the same physical space as people working in crypto. Employers in the field are hungry for new talent. The market is so new that it's still quite difficult to find crypto-knowledgeable people.\n\nGo to an Ethereum or Bitcoin meetup, and consider attending one of the dozens of cryptocurrency conferences held around the globe every year. A conference will acquaint you with more crypto players in just one day than you could hope to bump into over a lifetime.\n\n4. Re-evaluate your beliefs about your skills\n\nSo you've been working as an accountant for the last ten years. Or maybe you have an advanced degree in psychology. You're convinced that your current skill set is the only one you have to work with.\n\nFalse. Joining the crypto world means potentially finding out that your current skill set isn't in very high demand here (Bitcoin takes care of the accounting itself, ya know?). This may call for learning a new skill.\n\nIt would be a disservice to say that coding isn't the top-demanded skill in crypto right now (and maybe everywhere else, too). But don't get your knickers in a twist about going back to college or something crazy like that – college isn't needed for crypto though a free introduction to Digital Currencies course at the University of Nicosia, taught in part by Antonopoulos, might help get you off the ground.\n\nOne statistic states that at least half of all people working with computers right now didn't graduate from college, while a huge chunk of them didn't even graduate from high school. New skills can be learned online, on your own, or from an individual mentor. Which leads us to. . .\n\n5. Be willing to learn a new skill (and maybe even work for free)\n\nThe irrelevancy of college degrees in tech-related fields means that a shift in educational methods is taking place. After all, until we all have download-ready computer chips in our brains, new skills still have to be learned. But the learning itself has shifted from being institution-directed to self-directed.\n\nIf someone possesses a skill you'd like to acquire, ask if you can work for them for free while learning their trade. If this sounds like a brilliant new idea, it's not – it's called apprenticeship, and it's as old as trade itself. Working for free for awhile may be expensive, but it's not nearly as expensive as college and loans.\n\nAnd remember, there's always the mother of all options: start a business yourself. Cryptocurrency is very entrepreneur-friendly, and the barriers to entry are next to none.\n\nGood luck! And may Satoshi be with you.\n\nDo you work in crypto? If so, what other tips would you offer job-seekers?\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

He was going to simultaneously defend Paycoin, an imploding bitcoin-like currency he launched in December from a horde of angry investors and detractors, and celebrate it with his legion of true believers.\n\nOn January 15, the day before the three-day conference, organizers announced Garza’s appearance had been canceled. Garza said it was a misunderstanding – it was only that the talk\'s original time and place was cancelled while the bitcoin conference looked for a more appropriate venue. But even though he was widely seen at conference events, it ended without Garza taking the stage.\n\nAs of Monday, Paycoin is the fourth largest of the so-called cryptocurrencies. But it\'s slipping fast. Last week it held the No. 3 spot. Today, the combined value of the 12 million Paycoin is nearly $35 million, down $10 million since the conference.\n\nIn the world of bitcoin and its alternatives, Garza has emerged as one of the most polarizing figures. On Hashtalk, GAW\'s official public forum, he\'s considered the savior of cryptocurrency. On Reddit and Bitcointalk, his skeptics have been calling him a con man for the better part of a year, ever since he first established a bitcoin mining operation. GAW\'s businesses have been accused on all three forums of Ponzi schemes, fraud, securities violations and censoring critics. Paycoin has been mired with unmet expectations.\n\n“There\'s this witch hunt,” said Garza in a Passcode interview in advance of the Miami conference. “You\'re automatically guilty unless you prove you’re not.”\n\nAmid a trail of controversies, even many of his faithful want to know: Is Garza a huckster, a hero being martyred by bad publicity, or simply a well-intentioned businessman in over his head? And for many of the people who have invested in Paycoin, they just want to know what\'s happening to their money.\n\nThe first GAW\n\nIn 2006, Garza was a main attraction at a campaign rally for then-congressional-candidate Peter Welch. Mr. Welch held up Garza as a prototypical Vermont business owner he would nurture to put the state ""at the front of an emerging world economy [with] well-paying jobs today and tomorrow.”\n\nGarza was 21. His two companies, Optima Technology and Great Auk Wireless, already had 20 employees. He was only in high school when he started the computer repair company Optima out of his bedroom.\n\n“Senior year I really struggled with ADD, going to the specially tailored classes but couldn\'t pay attention. So I struggled a lot grade-wise,” said Garza. “So I said, ‘Hey, I should go start a business.\' ""\n\nOptima quickly outgrew Garza’s home. “We had just enough money for first months and last rent for an office,” he said. “We were so convinced we were going to make money we bought a safe that was worth more than we’d ever put in it.\n\nGarza leveraged Optima\'s success to start Great Auk Wireless (the original GAW), a wireless broadband provider for underserved rural areas. It was his start of a career as a serial entrepreneur.\n\nYears later, detractors would use one of the original GAW’s biggest scrapes to discredit the second GAW, though it was a textbook example of why major providers avoided rural services. GAW was offered a $40,000 grant to serve Ashfield, Massachusetts, but the city went years without access before Garza gave up in 2012, unable to find a tower location. He never completed the job.\n\nGarza\'s roots in cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin is the most prominent cryptocurrency, but it’s far from the only one. There are coins that donate transaction fees to charity, coins based on Internet memes including Doge and a coin that honors Juggalos, the clown-make-up-wearing fans of the Insane Clown Posse. There are successes, scams, and everything in between.\n\nThough they are called currency, coins are more like bartered commodities, establishing market value through how difficult they are for speculators to harvest. Many cryptocurrencies are “mined,” awarded for solving complicated math problems requiring specialized computers. The value of those coins are set by the cost of the facilities to mine them.\n\nEnter Garza’s GAW Miners.\n\nGAW, now standing for “Geniuses at Work,” is pronounced like “GAWsome,” slang the company regularly uses since it opened in February. In that short time, GAW has been a mining hardware vendor, a hardware host, a cloud-based mining service, a simulated mining service, a digital wallet, and a currency. Garza moves at breakneck speed. He had only been interested in Bitcoin for a couple of months when he opened shop.\n\nGarza’s initial plan was to mine Bitcoin for himself. But everything changed when he paid for equipment that a vendor never sent.\n\n“It wasn\'t even the financial loss that got to me,” Garza told Passcode. “It was knowing that these guys had no idea whether or not I could have afforded it. I could have been someone that had a billion dollars just as easily as someone who had cashed out every bit of their life savings to make that purchase and these guys didn\'t care one way or the other.“\n\nFly-by-night mining companies cheating customers is common. Cryptocurrency is the Wild West. Just this October, the Federal Trade Commission shuttered Butterfly Labs for providing obsolete equipment.\n\nGarza sat down and made a list of companies known for scamming customers. He had decided to run them all out of business.\n\nThe second GAW\n\nIf GAW wanted to be an honest vendor in a sea of corruption, they were by many accounts pretty good at it. But by March, GAW changed business plans, the first of many times. Cryptocurrency mining gets harder over time so ever-improving hardware doesn’t inadvertently flood the market. The week it took mining hardware to ship would mathematically be customers’ most lucrative week. Now GAW would host miners they sold for free, eliminating shipping entirely.\n\n“I think we did $50,000 our first day,” Garza says. It was an immediate success.\n\nIt was here that Scott Booth got involved with Garza, first as a client and then as a friend. Mr. Booth runs the Nevada-based embedded-systems company SGB Enterprises. “I saw a little of myself in him,” Booth said.\n\nBooth became part of Garza’s inner circle. But the relationship soon began to sour when Garza again shifted the company’s focus. This time, GAW stopped selling hardware. Instead it would sell “Hashlets,” increments of processing power on a cloud-based mining network. “I explained, in a nutshell, that he needed to stick to a business plan,” said Booth. “Every three or four weeks, there seemed like a new concept he wanted to pursue.”\n\nBooth thought Hashlets’ initial price was exploitative, yet it kept rising.\n\nLike many of Garza\'s critics, Booth claims that he was banned from public comment on the forums. GAW has a reputation among its detractors for filtering Hashtalk of any negative comment and scrubbing Garza’s posts whenever new circumstances contradict them. They keep an image archive of what they claim to be Garza’s deleted posts.\n\nAs GAW amassed Hashlet sales, customers noticed something strange. Cryptocurrency mining is too complex for a single computer; users join massive, profit-splitting computing pools to up their processing power. But while GAW let users pick pools to join and paid users based on those pools\' successes, the pools themselves didn’t see any increase in traffic. GAW sold too much processing power for that to be possible.\n\nCustomers began wondering if GAW was a Ponzi scheme. “There was no solid evidence, but there were a lot of hints and red flags,” said Grant Honeycutt, a Washington financial services provider who purchased Hashlets in August and now tries to “rescue” current investors.\n\nGarza said there was nothing nefarious. As clients rolled in, he said, GAW’s processing power became too large to mine small coins without damaging market scarcity. He risked “blow[ing] them up.”\n\nInstead, Garza used the computers to make money independently of clients’ choices, but paid clients based on their chosen pools.\n\nForum posts make clear, however, that many customers claimed they were not aware Hashlets were not actually miners.\n\n“Actually, we let the customers know that a lot,” Garza said, in response to those complaints. “In some cases we might not have been as clear. In some cases we might not have let them know more than one time.”\n\nBuried within the terms of service is the line: “Selecting a Pool does not imply … mining at the selected Pool.”\n\nWhere GAW made the money it distributed is still a controversy.\n\nGarza says it came from mining Bitcoin in a private pool. This is a crucial point. If any distributed funds did not come from mining, his critics point out that selling Hashlets would be in part dangerously similar to selling securities in GAW. And since GAW never registered with the Securities and Exchange Commision, it could be prosecuted for possible civil and criminal violations of securities laws. A purported screen capture of a since-deleted Hashtalk post widely distributed on forums criticizing GAW shows Garza admitting payouts came from renting out mining hardware.\n\nBooth has led a charge to see Garza punished for this and other violations, publicly reporting GAW to agencies including the SEC.\n\nBirth of a new currency\n\nAs mining became less profitable, Garza introduced another service: loyalty points customers could exchange for an upcoming GAW cryptocurrency, eventually titled Paycoin.\n\nGarza points out he was under no obligation to even offer the points. Other mining services simply allowed their customers’ investments to collapse.\n\nPaycoin came with a series of promises worded ambiguously enough to seem implausibly profitable. Intentional or not, the ambiguity came back to bite investors – and Garza, too.\n\nGarza promised ""top tier"" retail partnerships and the ability to use Paycoin at Amazon, Target, and Walmart. Users took this to mean they could use Paycoin directly on Amazon, Target, and Walmart websites. Instead, Garza says, he meant purchases could be made through GAW’s digital wallet service or Paycoin debit cards – a far less impressive promise to people looking to establish Paycoin\'s legitimacy. He admits he should have corrected misconceptions sooner.\n\n“There have been times where what we\'ve said has rolled forward in a game of telephone,” says Garza.\n\nSo it would have been no surprise to Garza that those retailers denied a partnership when the cryptocurrency news site Coin Fire asked. Coin Fire’s article concluded noting GAW declined to comment. GAW threatened to sue Coin Fire, claiming they were never contacted by the reporter.\n\nCoin Fire provided Passcode with evidence they had contacted GAW through its website. Editor Mike Johnson says they have more than a terabyte of evidence to back his story’s claims, including emails to several GAW representatives.\n\nGarza wouldn’t comment on a legal matter. He did, however, say cryptocurrency supporters should consider “whether or not their actions are helping move this industry forward or backward.”\n\nThis wasn\'t GAW\'s first, or last run in with Coinfire. Coinfire broke the story that Hashlets weren\'t mining (""We didn\'t set out to slam them,"" said Johnson. ""They were advertisers."") Last week, Coin Fire reported a SEC investigation was underway. The SEC would not confirm or deny a current investigation.\n\nDespite the ""partnership"" hiccup, Garza still promises integration with merchants.\n\n“We have tons and tons of merchants a day calling, trying to incorporate Paycoin – more than 100 already have,” he said, unwilling to answer who these might be. “I’ve gotten in trouble bringing names up before.”\n\nUntil Coin Fire published its report of the alleged SEC investigation, Hashtalk users took no stock in the site. Those on the forum have a common phrase to describe the sentiment from critics such as Johnson: FUD – fear, uncertainty and doubt. But after the report – and a subsequent dip in Paycoin\'s value – it\'s been harder to ignore Coin Fire\'s reporting.\n\nAnd the decline of Paycoin\n\nGarza claimed Paycoin would be worth $20 and GAW had capital set to ""shift the market” and maintain that value. But the December launch thudded. One Paycoin currently sells for under $3.\n\nTwenty dollars was a prediction, said Garza, not a promise, based on “reasonable” assumptions. Still, he never corrected users\' expectations that GAW would enforce a price floor of $20.\n\n“There are variables we never saw and we didn’t factor in. The one that matters most is the organized effort to see Paycoin fail,” he said.\n\nThat conspiracy would be no small effort: amassing substantial amounts of coins at a rate that didn’t arouse suspicion and precisely coordinating sales to thwart buying momentum.\n\nGAW was unable to contain outrage over the allegedly promised pay floor. In early January, Garza announced a program to buy back at least $100,000 Paycoins a month at $20. Five thousand coins is only $100,000. Processing the 12 million Paycoin could literally take millennia.\n\nFor many, it was too little too late. Many more threw in the towel after his role in the Miami conference evaporated.\n\nCracks in confidence are beginning to show, even on his forum.\n\nGarza posted a lengthy note on Hashtalk trying to rally the troops away from fear, uncertainty and doubt. ""We will make this happen. Period. Not through my strength, but ours,"" he wrote.\n\nBut an investor\'s post in another thread summed up a growing sentiment. “Is it FUD if it\'s true?”', ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article.\n\nNEA's Yang on seed funding, bitcoin, why Peter Thiel is wrong on swimming\n\n– TechFlash Editor, Silicon Valley Business Journal By Cromwell Schubarth TechFlash Editor, Silicon Valley Business Journal Jan 26, 2015, 12:34pm PST\n\n– TechFlash Editor, Silicon Valley Business Journal By Cromwell Schubarth TechFlash Editor, Silicon Valley Business Journal Jan 26, 2015, 12:34pm PST"", 'Bitcoin trader Burton Wagner is facing five years in jail after being arrested in Colorado for the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\nIn a filing to the United States District Court, the Federal Government claims that Wagner “did knowingly conduct, control, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business” and that he further “operated without an appropriate money transmitting license in a state where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or felony under state law.”\n\nFurther allegations claim that he “failed to comply with the money transmitting business regulations under Section 5330 of Title 31, United States Code” and was involved “in the transport and transmission of funds that were known to the defendant to have been derived from a criminal offense and were intended to be used to promote and support unlawful activity.”\n\nWagner claims in his defense that he was arrested for simply buying and selling Bitcoin and that “The federal prosecutor believes a person must have a money transmittal license to buy and sell Bitcoins for individual investment.”\n\nWhile Wagner was involved in buying and selling Bitcoins, his online persona doesn’t offer many details, and after conversations with him, we are perhaps more confused.\n\nHe pops up from time to time, but is an active participant on Bitcoin forums where he uses the name BurtW; this is where the story gets interesting.\n\nWagner was a participant in HYIP scams, including a program called “Pirate Pass Through,” a ponzi scam offered by the disgraced Bitcoin Savings & Trust; Trendon T. Shavers, aka “pirateat40,” the operator of Bitcoin Savings & Trust was arrested in 2013 for running a Ponzi scam.

01/27/2015,"['There\'s a trillion reasons why the Winklevoss twins are in love with Bitcoin.\n\nThe brothers, known for their legal battle with Facebook (FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg, believe the controversial cryptocurrency is the payments network of the future. That\'s despite Bitcoin\'s 60% plunge in 2014.\n\nThey predict Bitcoin\'s market capitalization could easily skyrocket to at least $400 billion, or roughly the combined size of modern day payments companies like American Express (AXP), Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and Western Union (WU).\n\nBut the Internet entrepreneurs are taking it one step further. They believe Bitcoin could one day morph into a gold-like asset class -- or even surpass it.\n\n""If Bitcoin is a better gold or seen as a type of gold-like asset, then it could be in the trillions on a market cap,"" Tyler Winklevoss told CNNMoney. ""We do feel those are very real possibilities.""\n\nRelated: Gold is sexy again as it jumps above $1,300\n\nReaching over $1 trillion in market cap is hard to fathom, especially because Bitcoin\'s current market cap is less than $4 billion.\n\nMany skeptics remain convinced Bitcoin was a bubble that will soon die out.

We\'re in it for the long haul,"" Cameron Winklevoss said during a presentation at ETF.com\'s Inside ETFs Conference.\n\nRelated: Spent bitcoins? Expect a tax headache\n\nBut the WInklevoss twins realize Bitcoin needs help. The 2014 bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange, has raised questions about the currency\'s security.

A creditor meeting has been scheduled for 27th February, according to the filing.\n\nThe Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing suggests that negotiations between CoinTerra and its list of creditors did not result in a solution that would see the company continuing to operate.\n\nIn a recent interview, CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar said that the firm's future hinged on the outcome of those discussions.\n\nCoinDesk reached out to CoinTerra for comment, but did not receive a response by press time.\n\nCoinTerra's bankruptcy filing can be found below:\n\nCointerra Bankruptcy Filing\n\nImages via Cointerra, Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The founders will be helping with the transition.\n\nANX COO Dave Chapman said another business relationship currently being put in place will also provide the exchange with access to vital money transmission business (MTB) licenses and banking relationships throughout North America. Further details were not available at this time.\n\nANX recently acquired and relaunched the troubled Norwegian exchange Justcoin, giving it a new foothold in the European market while maintaining the original brand.\n\nCoinMKT trades in bitcoin and a number of other cryptocurrencies including litecoin, dogecoin, and peercoin.', 'Crypto 2.0 startup Colu has raised $2.5m as part of a seed funding round with which it seeks to advance the development of the colored coins concept.\n\nLed by VC firms Aleph and Spark Capital, contributing investors also included VC Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Opportunity Corp and boutique angel fund Box Group. Notably, Spark Capital’s past investments include now-famous tech startups such as Foursquare, Tumblr and Twitter, as well as fashion startup Warby Parker.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Colu framed its project as one that would strive to find everyday use cases for the more advanced applications of bitcoin’s blockchain as a record-keeping tool for online identity and the Internet of Things.\n\nFor example, co-founder and CEO Amos Meiri indicated that Colu’s first application will focus on using bitcoin tokens as a form of two-factor authentication, but that the company will more broadly seek to uncover new use cases for cryptographic tokens.\n\nMeiri further sought to position Colu as a market leader in the crypto 2.0 space owing to the status of its assembled investors, stating:\n\n“This is the first time that blue chip investors have invested in 2.0. That gives a lot of confidence to big companies that want to integrate with the technologies.”\n\nThe nine-member team has been focusing on development to date, but aims to use the funds to improve its business prospects. Meiri indicated that Colu will now seek to find partner companies, while growing its team to 12 members.\n\nOverall, investors such as Aleph\'s Eden Shochat expressed enthusiasm at the potential for both Colu and colored coins technology.\n\n""If anything, the issue with colored coins is it has too many exciting opportunities, not even just a single focus,"" Shochat said.\n\nThe investment is also one of the first from major VC firms in foundational crypto 2.0 technology, as similar projects in the ecosystem have largely relied on bitcoin-enabled crowdfunding.\n\nFrom art to ticketing\n\nCrucial to encouraging the wider of use of colored coins, Meiri contends is that Colu’s technology appeals to developers. This means investing in creating simple APIs and software development kits (SDKs) that allow companies to tap into bitcoin’s capabilities.\n\nOverall, Meiri framed Colu as a Chain for colored coins, comparing his startup to the bitcoin API developer that received $9.5m in a funding round this August.\n\nIn addition to a bitcoin-based social authentication alternative, Meiri said Colu is already talking with companies that are seeking to build more specific applications of the technology without the need to become experts in the specifics of bitcoin technology.\n\n“One example is an art app that wants to issue tokens to certificate art and have it be tradeable,” Meiri explained. “We want people to use 2.0 technology without even knowing they’re using bitcoin.”\n\nOther examples he cited included using tokens for ticketing and as access mechanisms for connected devices.\n\nClose to market\n\nShochat framed his firm\'s investment in Colu as the first step in what has been a long discovery process, though one that he expects to bear fruit soon.\n\n""We’ve been tracking a few teams that are doing colored coin work, but Amos’ team got us to buy into their focus on using the technology as an access layer as opposed to a generic platform,"" Shochat said.\n\nWhile Shochat suggested that many of the more exciting opportunities colored coins and cryptographic tokens can unlock are years away, he expects initial applications to launch in the short term.\n\n""The initial applications are very close to what we’re seeing today,"" he said. ""It\'s a period of months, not years.""\n\nShochat added that his firm is increasingly interested in 2.0 technology as it has fewer regulatory issues, though he said his firm is still interested in the financial applications of bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nHe went on to cite selling tokens as access to networks or as part of crowdfunding campaigns as applications in which he is personally most interested.\n\nPutting tech first\n\nMeiri also sought to position the funding as evidence that the concept of colored coins, while one of the oldest in the crypto 2.0 space, can still compete with newer entrants.\n\nLike a number of projects including the more recently prominent Counterparty and Ethereum, colored coins use the bitcoin blockchain as a transfer mechanism. While projects like Counterparty or Omni have issued new coins on the bitcoin protocol to achieve this end, colored coins is a layer that augments bitcoins to signify specific assets.\n\nAlongside Colu’s lead developer, Meiri is also a leading influence behind the recently relaunched Colored Coins foundation, a membership body representing startups experimenting with the technology including ChromaWallet, CoinPrism and CoinSpark.\n\nMeiri said that while Colu has ambitious mainstream goals, the project’s first priority will be to ensure that the colored coins ecosystem can continue its drive toward interoperability.\n\n“First we want to get colored coins back up on its feet. We want to have a standard for colored coins,” Meiri said.\n\nThe Colored Coins foundation expects to publish its standard in the coming months.\n\nImages via Colu\n\nFor further information on cryptocurrency 2.0 projects download our research report.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

So I think the maturity of it – I don\'t think it\'s quite there yet,"" Baxter said.\n\nBaxter pointed to bitcoin miners dropping out of the network as evidence that the cryptocurrency\'s economics failed to ""stack up"". He was building on an earlier point that technology innovators should focus their efforts on the ""core"" of the existing financial system, rather than its periphery.\n\nHe said:\n\n""The real game is using digital to transform the core of our industry. [Existing platforms] are low cost, they\'re regulated, they\'re trusted – why wouldn\'t you want to innovate on top of this platform?""\n\nCentralised platforms are more efficient\n\nBaxter spoke as part of a panel moderated by FT Alphaville blogger Izabella Kaminska that included former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis; Bob Ferguson, head of the Financial Conduct Authority\'s Policy, Risk & Research Division; and Giles Andrews, co-founder of peer-to-peer lending company Zopa.\n\nMatonis agreed that centralised platforms would often be more efficient than decentralised systems like bitcoin, although he said the economics of using bitcoin would change if the amount of commerce going through the blockchain increased sufficiently.\n\n""In a majority of use cases the centralised system is going to be far more efficient in doing a lot of things,"" Matonis said. ""The thing about distributed blockchain technology is you have to determine why you need it ... transaction fees will replace miner rewards if there is sufficient commerce riding across the blockchain.""\n\nFerguson stressed that his organisation remains neutral on emerging technologies and that the regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies in the UK is still being shaped.\n\n""In the UK, they might be regulated for AML purposes, or they might not be regulated at all,"" he said. ""We just have to wait and see.""\n\nBanking system isn\'t \'fit for purpose\'\n\nFerguson seemed to largely agree with Citi\'s Baxter on the point that the existing financial system would adapt to changing consumer needs and emerging technologies.\n\nHe said\n\n""I don\'t think banks are doomed to obsolescence, I think they will be able to adjust over time. They have legacy systems so they can\'t transform themselves overnight ... I think we\'ll see innovation rather than extinction.""\n\nAndrews took issue with the idea that the existing banking system is sufficient for consumer needs. He also lauded the potential of the blockchain as a technology that could change the way banks themselves are run.\n\n""What can the blockchain do to banking\'s core system? Building on what\'s there and what works is a laudable aim, but so much of banking is simply broken,"" he said. ""I think many would argue it\'s not fit for purpose anymore.""\n\nKaminska repeated several critiques she has made about bitcoin on her Alphaville blog. She questioned the economics of the blockchain, saying that many costs, including transaction costs, were currently ""disguised"". Kaminska also argued that bitcoin isn\'t quite as revolutionary as its supporters claim.\n\nClosing the panel discussion, she said:\n\n""On Twitter I never get the last word with Jon [Matonis] ... Whenever I speak to central bankers who are interested in this area, when it comes to a decentralised ledger, they say, \'We\'ve already got that.

A document filed by US Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado formally requested the District Court Judge handling the case, the Honorable William J. Martinez, to dismiss the case.]\n\nBitcoin trader Burton Wagner has been arrested and may face 5 years in prison for his money transmitting activities dating back to 2012.\n\nThe US Federal Prosecution accuses Wagner of operating without a money transmitting license in a state where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or felony. The Feds further allege that Wagner participated in the Pirate Pass-Through scam operated by the now-infamous Bitcoin Savings & Trust.\n\nAs they say in an indictment submitted to the Federal District Court of Colorado, Wagner was “in the transport and transmission of funds that were known to the defendant to have been derived from a criminal offense and were intended to be used to promote and support unlawful activity.”\n\nThe extent of Wagner involvement in the Bitcoin Savings & Trust Ponzi scheme has yet to be ascertained, while Silicon Angle reports that there is “ample evidence” that he was “pushing” the scheme in a senior investment capacity.\n\nHis activities date back to 2012, when an account allegedly linked to his identity, BurtW, seemingly caused suspicion among Bitcointalk users due to his involvement in certain schemes.\n\nWagner’s wife, Jean, has further taken to the internet in order to dispel myths purported by Silicon Angle and others surrounding her husband’s connection to Bruce Wagner, author of the blog Bitcoinme.com.\n\n“Please stop confusing BurtW with Bruce Wagner. They are not the same person,” she wrote on a fundraiser set up to help with the costs surrounding the case, which she describes as “astronomical.”\n\nColorado has traditionally been fairly liberal towards cryptocurrency use. Since private use of cannabis is legal in the state, cannabis-oriented cryptocurrencies such as Potcoin and even Bitcoin cannabis vending machines can operate freely. However, in spite of being the first state to legalize recreational use and being among the 20 US states to legalize medicinal use, Colorado was not one of the 24 states to license Coinbase’s new exchange operation this month.\n\nThe case meanwhile continues and, if found guilty, Wagner faces a maximum five-year jail term. The prosecution has also requested a US$250,000 fine and seizure of his property.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

01/28/2015,"[""Once upon a time, stretching as far back as the 8th century, some people tried to convince other people that they could turn base metals into gold.\n\nIt can’t be done.\n\nIn 2009, along came someone, or some people, who called himself, or themselves, Satoshi Nakamoto, and went the alchemists one better. The mysterious inventor of the crypto-currency bitcoin—who appeared like a ghost out of nowhere, never showed his face or revealed his true identity, and vanished two years later—apparently managed to convince some people that he had turned thin air into money.\n\n***\n\nWe first met on a summer’s day in 2013, in a New York City hotel—the Satoshi Faithful and me—during a one-day bitcoin conference, held in a high-ceilinged, carpeted hall with 350 folding chairs, a stage along the far wall with a podium set up for speakers, a long table laid out for panel discussions and, behind that, a big screen to show power point slides.\n\nWaiting for the morning session to begin, as everyone mingled there, and in an ante-room where coffee was served, it struck me that most of these people knew most of these people and, given their age, this could have been their five-year high school reunion.\n\nNot that I’d expected a geek and nerd crowd of spotty 14 year-olds. But here was a room filled with used-to-be spotty 14 year-olds who, somewhere along the way, had smoked the same brand of fervent enthusiasm that you find in believers on any given Sunday at a packed revivalist church.\n\n“Ignore bitcoin at your peril,” a young man warned.\n\nI asked, “Why’s that?”\n\n“Fiat currencies are doomed.”\n\nA young woman told me, “I’m here to get rich.”\n\nThat was a common theme, and I felt a paternal instinct to remind her that when it comes to investing, there is a single truth that can never be ignored—the higher the returns, the higher the risk.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Or, as one economist later told me, if such a thing is even possible that’s exactly why bitcoin won’t survive. If that ever happened, people would flee bitcoin for gold.\n\nAn equally earnest fellow informed me, “The problem is that central bankers are white collar terrorists. It’s obvious. Their job is to steal your money. They erode the value of the dollar. Ever hear of inflation? They can’t do that with bitcoin.” He wrote me off with a shrug. “But you’re too old to see the benefits of new technologies.”\n\nPerhaps I was the oldest person in the room, but I couldn’t let that go unanswered. “No, I’m not.”\n\n“You won’t admit it, even when you’re using it without realizing it.” He showed his disdain. “Fiat money is a waste of time. And when everyone in the world is using bitcoins instead of your old fashioned fiat money…”\n\nAnother person assured me, with absolute authority, “The dollar is dead.”\n\nI wondered, “Has anyone else in the country heard this news yet?”\n\n“Do you deny Austrian economics? The government is in a panic. They know this is the end. But there’s nothing they can do. It’s too late.” Another of The Faithful now proclaimed, “Without central banking, all the wars of the 20th century would not have taken place.”\n\nI suggested, all the wars of the 18th century and of the 17th century and of the 16th century, too, had taken place before central banks.\n\nHe wasn’t interested.\n\nI’d come with an open mind to find out about bitcoin the currency and had run head first into bitcoin the religion. I wouldn’t have blinked if they’d all been wearing orange robes.\n\nWhat I was seeing, others had seen before. Economist Nouriel Roubini expressed it best when he likened bitcoin bugs to gold bugs, describing them as, “Fanatics who speak of bitcoin in cult-like religious ways. Like gold bugs they have paranoid conspiracy views on the dollar.”\n\nSomeone I would speak with more than a year later assured me, “Most of the people behind bitcoin see it as a grand plot to take over democracy. They just don’t understand that bankers never lose.”\n\nLeading the chants was an anarchist crowd. But instead of Hari Krishna, their mantra was, “The absurdity of central banks,” and “The irrelevancy of self-serving capital controls.”\n\nHere they had the volume turned way up. Especially when it came to financial support for the WikiLeaks leader, Julian Assange, and the NSA secret-leaker Edward Snowden.\n\nCredit card companies had stopped taking contributions to both, but both could access bitcoins. Which is how The Faithful came to honor bitcoins as a blessed medal for constitutionally protected free speech.\n\nDivinity extended to their support of various people in Iran, usually, but not exclusively, poets, dissidents and musicians. Ignoring any sanctions in place, The Faithful proclaimed sanctions didn’t apply because bitcoin and the First Amendment are synonymous. From there, free speech morphed into the use of bitcoins to purchase illegal drugs for personal use on underground websites like Silk Road.\n\nOne fellow at the conference told a story about how he’d received a panic email from a school group in Nigeria, 6600 miles away, who’d accidentally crossed the border into another country and needed money to bribe officials to get home. Luckily, this man had bitcoins to send them and, thanks to that, the group made it back safely.\n\nIf it’s true, I’m glad that he was able to help them.\n\nBut… Third World thugs with guns at remote border crossings accepting bitcoins? Seriously? The story was far too convenient, far too self-serving and simply not believable.\n\nStill, The Faithful ate it up, blindly accepting as truth whatever they wanted to hear.\n\nAfter that, a refugee from Iran who’d sought safety in the US, received a big round of applause for saying that people in Iran had more freedom of speech than anyone in the United States.\n\nThat was followed by a standing ovation for a woman who announced that she didn’t care about the US Constitution, because the government was using it to deny us our Constitutional rights and, therefore, the Constitution didn’t matter.\n\nLater, I would come across these comments in bitcoin forums. The parentheses are theirs, not mine:\n\n“You can bet the Rothschild Global Central Bankers (who work for the Jesuit global trusts) do not want this currency to succeed, and will do everything in their power and considerable wealth to crash it or cause it to become invalidated. They have openly stated throughout history they do not like competition, sinking the Titanic (actually the Olympia) to rid some of their foes (do your homework). That is just one of hundreds of examples. If world wars, etc. are not beyond their means to secure their dominance, what makes you think they wouldn’t attempt to game this system? Bitcoin represents their worst nightmare.”\n\nDisregarding the anti-Semitic drivel of using Rothschild as shorthand for Jews—and all the time wondering how the Jesuits got involved and, if it was the Olympia that hit the iceberg whatever happened to the Titanic?—the running theme of “them against us,” and “the rest of the world is out of step” unites The Faithful in their quest for world currency domination.\n\nAnother person wrote, “Banks have been given trillions of Federal Reserve Notes at virtually 0% interest, under the assumption that the banks would loan out the money, thus stimulating the economy.\n\nHowever, the banks haven’t been actually obligated in any way to utilize the funds in this manner. The result has been that the bankers have been using most of it on high-frequency stock trading, cocaine, and hookers.”\n\nSomeone else pointed out, “We live in a world where the global economy is literally dependent on the quality of blowjob some international banking cartel manager received this morning.”\n\nIt goes on and on and on.\n\nThe government can’t be trusted.\n\nBanks can’t be trusted.\n\nFiat currencies are doomed.\n\nThe dollar is dead.\n\nSatoshi lives.\n\nBitcoin and us… we are the only answer.\n\nWherever they can, The Faithful expound on how bitcoin represents, “An existential threat to the power structure created by hierarchical money printing.”\n\nTo see that bitcoin will triumph, they claim you merely have to, “Look at what central banks have done to humanity. Why would you even want them touching money?”\n\nAnd, “People and states are moving away from the dollar. And when it reaches a critical mass, the dollar will blow up. And the dollar will go the way of every massive devalued fiat currency.”\n\nThis anger in their bellies is particularly alive and well on Twitter.\n\n“Bitcoin isn’t ideological, but anti-ideological. Because it empowers people against ideology-supported violence of the state.”\n\nAnd, “If #Bitcoin is bad for #US#Monetary #Policy this is a good thing.”\n\nAnd this, in sequential Tweets: “Bitcoin makes the 85 people who own the world’s wealth not so wealthy. I think their money should value to nothing and we start over with a fresh new slate. Take the power away and soon their wealth will amount to nothing JUST LIKE POGS.”\n\nBy mid-afternoon, with the firebrand preachers doing their thing, the choir in full force, and The Faithful speaking in tongues, I began asking myself, for the average guy on the street, what problems does bitcoin solve?\n\nThat’s when a voice came down from the rafters and spoke to me: These people are their own worst enemy.\n\nI offed on a year’s trek around Planet Bitcoin, where a digital-something pretends to be a currency; that same digital-something is played with like a commodity; a political movement reeks of a delusional cult; and a technology—a peer-to-peer transfer system—happens to be brilliant.\n\nWhat it all comes down to is this yearlong realization: That if the technology is to survive and prosper, and well it should, then the other three—the pretend currency, the pretend commodity and the anarchist mob—will have to be rudely shoved out of it’s way.\n\n***\n\nFrom Bitcon: The Naked Truth About Bitcoin by Jeffrey Robinson. Reprinted with permission of the author."", 'This morning The Federal Reserve Bitcoin Strategy was released in a paper outlining multiple options for improving the U.S. payment system.\n\nIn the past, Digital currency had been deemed too immature. Now, after pressure from private sector interests, the Fed is seriously analyzing the benefit of incorporating Bitcoin code in the U.S. fiat system.\n\n“A U.S. payment system that is safe, efficient and broadly accessible is vital to the U.S. economy… the Federal Reserve plays an important role in promoting these qualities as a leader, catalyst for change and provider of payment services…”\n\nIn its preface, “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System”, a white paper released Monday morning, 15/27/01, by The Federal Reserve re-affirms that commitment. The document is a follow-up to the Fed’s 2013 “Payment System Improvement – Public Consultation Paper.” At the time of the 2013 report, digital currency was “not considered a sufficiently mature technology.” But, today, we are an “emergent payment infrastructure” and the Fed sees value for some Bitcoin technology within its current system.\n\n“A digital transfer vehicle was not considered[sic] a sufficiently mature technology… but was identified for further exploration and monitoring given significant interest in the marketplace.”\n\nIn both documents, Bitcoin is never mentioned by name. Instead, Digital Value Transfer Vehicle is used as a clever euphemism. Even though, it’s difficult to ignore the similarities to line #1 of the Federal Reserve Board‘s analysis in “Bitcoin: Technical Background and Data Analysis.”\n\n“Broadly speaking, Bitcoin is a scheme designed to facilitate the transfer of value between parties.”\n\nClearly, the Federal Reserve is interested in exploring what enhancements they can lift from Bitcoin source code. Let’s take a look at their goals and see if we can’t save them some time and (our) money.\n\nThe What: (un)Desirable Outcomes\n\n1) A ubiquitous, safe, faster electronic solution(s) for making a broad variety of business and personal payments supported by a flexible and cost-effective means for payment clearing and settlement groups to settle their positions rapidly and with finality\n\n2) U.S. payment system security that remains very strong, with public confidence that remains high and protections and incident response that keeps pace with the rapidly evolving and expanding threat environment.\n\n3) Greater proportion of payments originated and received electronically to reduce the average end-to-end (societal) costs of payment transactions and enable innovative payment services that deliver improved value to consumers and businesses.\n\n4) Better choices for U.S. consumers and businesses to send and receive convenient, cost-effective and timely cross-border payments.\n\n5) Needed payment system improvements are collectively identified and embraced by a broad array of payment participants, with material progress in implementing them.\n\nAren’t outcomes one and four at odds? How do you achieve ‘better choices’ when you have ubiquitous participation? That’s like picking the presidential candidates for a two-party system and telling people “There, that’s your choice.”\n\nOutcome two concerns violence. I will guarantee anonymity will not be a production feature in The Federal Reserve’s Bitcoin Strategy – well, not for you or me. For the simple fact that the government needs to be able to send armed men to your home to threaten, coerce or kidnap you. When the government or organizations close to the government, use the term “public confidence” they’re talking about the ability to get away with committing violence… against you.\n\nOutcome three, they want a return on their investment. I.e. “Since you people and your bitcoins didn’t just go away we are being forced to make changes in our system. We don’t get out of bed for anything less than a few trillion. For this to be in our interest, we need to force adoption.” Plus, it plays so well with Outcome one – ubiquity.\n\nOutcome five, “All these… individuals are implementing systems that work for them. They don’t care that it becomes a technological nightmare to get our tendrils in their books. PayPal was bad enough. Now there’s Dwolla, Stripe, Xapo, Circle, Coinbase, BitPay. This is out of control guys. You’ve had your fun but its time to come back to Papa Reserve.”\n\nAlso Read: 10 Ways Bitcoin is Better than the Federal Reserve\n\nColor me jade, this wreaks of “We will engage the largest financial companies to discover what works best for them. Smaller organizations will be forced to change or die.”\n\nThe How: The Bitcoin Strategy\n\nLike pioneers heading West, many of us are enticed by Bitcoin because it exists outside the current establishment. Whether for freedom or fortune, we’re here. For all our faults, not too many voices speak up in favor of making Bitcoin more like the system we’re trying to abandon.\n\nHey, I guess it pays to be jaded\n\nStrategy 1: Actively Engage with Stakeholders on Initiatives Designed to Improve the U.S. Payment System\n\n“…the Federal Reserve has substantially enhanced its level of engagement with a broad array of payment system stakeholders… will facilitate active engagement of payment stakeholders… In addition, the Federal Reserve will participate, as appropriate, in industry-led initiatives designed to further the desired outcomes.”\n\n“We’ve got friends who put a lot of money into our careers. We can’t let the Credit Card companies or big banks down. Also, us and our friends can plan your life for you better than you can.”\n\nAlso Read: Are ‘Pull’ Credit Card Transactions Making You Overly Vulnerable?\n\nStrategy 2: Identify Effective Approach(es) for Implementing Safe, Ubiquitous, Faster Payments\n\n“Federal Reserve research suggests that faster speed is needed in five primary use cases encompassing at least 29 billion payments, or 12 percent of all U.S. payments annually.”\n\nBitcoin. Already. Does. This. Better.\n\nIt’s here, in a lonely addendum, that Digital Value Transfer Vehicles are defined:\n\n“Digital Value Transfer Vehicles are decentralized digital stores of value that can be exchanged.”\n\nAlthough it is never mentioned by name, there is one technology that fits that bill – Bitcoin. It’s doubtful that anything built by The Federal Reserve will run on Bitcoin directly. However, given the due diligence of government contractors in the past, there will likely be some copy/paste action happening.\n\nThis is part of the beauty of Bitcoin. The organizations it was built to replace cannot transition into the new paradigm Bitcoin brings without casting off the flaws that inspired Bitcoin in the first place. What I mean is, it is not enough for these organizations to simply replicate their business process on top of pseudo-bitcoin-code and a not-really-decentralized model. They must abandon the flaws fundamental to their identity – what makes them what they are.\n\nA fractional reserve banking system has no use beside Bitcoin. It’s not that we need The Federal Reserve 2.0. It’s that The Federal Reserve is made entirely obsolete by Bitcoin.\n\nDuring the industrial revolution thousands of skilled blue collar laborers were replaced by machines that increased production beyond imagination. Why should the digital revolution be any different? Software protocols can replace skilled white collar workers. Bitcoin makes obsolete a closed-door finance industry that works against the consumer. Trying to assimilate some of Bitcoin’s benefits with the Fed is like scrubbing a stain with a filthy rag.\n\nStrategy 3: Reduce Fraud Risk and Advance the Safety, Security and Resiliency of the Payment System\n\nPlacing high priority on improving authentication of transactions, parties and equipment in the payment process and actively pursuing ways to protect sensitive information and limit its use and availability;\n\nSeeking to share fraud and cyber threat information and analyze data to mitigate the adverse impact of threats to payment system security; and\n\nIncreasing the focus on and priority of security, making additional resources available to strengthen it\n\nThis is flawed. Perhaps this is the fork between Bitcoin and The Federal Reserve. By design, this system requires trust and permission. Bitcoin requires no sensitive information. It requires no trusted third parties and is not restricted by electronic equipment.\n\nOh, why don’t they share and analyze fraud and cyber threat information now? I’m sure this is just a platitude. Since, if they had been following that last bullet point prior to now I assume the second would be enacted.\n\nStrategy 4: Achieve Greater End-to-End Efficiency for Domestic and Cross-Border Payments\n\nThis problem exists because of systems like The Federal Reserve. Bitcoin removes the need for these legacy systems, thus the improvements The Fed proposes are not necessary.\n\nThis is the act of a dying patient injecting every needle, swallowing every pill, calling every doctor to their side to squeeze out every last second of life they have left.\n\nStrategy 5: Enhance Federal Reserve Bank Payment, Settlement and Risk Management Services\n\nWhy bother doing it if you aren’t going to grow your organization? There’s money being thrown around. Print some of that for yourselves, why don’t yah.\n\nThis was the only section with a definitive timeline. Basically, by 2016, The Federal Reserve wants to operate its National Settlement Service (NSS) 24/7.\n\nI’m not a banker, and government language is intentionally obtuse. I believe the NSS is the organization that settles interbank loans – perks of the fractional reserve system. Regardless, the current system accounts for 98.6% of all settlements, already.\n\nFedwire Funds and National Settlement Services\n\n“In 2013, Reserve Banks recovered 98.6 percent of the costs of their Fedwire Funds and National Settlement Services, including the related PSAF. Reserve Bank operating expenses and imputed costs for these operations totaled $97.1 million in 2013. Revenue from these services totaled $96.7 million, resulting in a net loss of $0.3 million.”\n\nThat’s Not a Strategy; It’s a Tactic.\n\n“The difference between strategy and tactics: strategy is done above the shoulders, tactics are done below the shoulders” – Sun Tzu, Art of War\n\nAnd it’s par for the course. The Federal Reserve released this document to let you know it will be spending an obscene amount of money attempting to replicate an existing, free technology. After backwards engineering out the good and it will add back its own bad.\n\nThis is not leadership or a catalyst for change. This is the high school bully copying your homework and making mistakes when they re-write it in their own handwriting. Instead of losing their own grade points, the bully’s errors are taken away from the rest of the classes’ grades while the bully continues operating with impunity.\n\nLeave the bully behind in their sandbox. It’s a big world with lots of people. It’s time to give people a chance at running their own lives. If anything, a digital dollar will make Bitcoin adoption that much easier.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', 'Gem Becomes the First Multi-Sig Developer Platform to Utilize FIPS-140-2 Level 3 Hardware Certified Security With Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) From Industry Leader Thales e-Security; Partners With Southeast Asia\'s CryptoSigma and US-Based Bitmo\n\nVENICE, CA--(Marketwired - Jan 28, 2015) - Gem (https://gem.co), the Venice-based Bitcoin startup offering a multi-signature security platform to Bitcoin developers, today announced a major shift in the future of Bitcoin security with the deployment of custom Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) from payment security giant Thales e-Security, now offered as part of Gem\'s standard multi-sig wallet offering.\n\nThese HSM devices, used to protect military encryption keys and other mission critical secrets, secure more than 80% of global payment transactions. They include FIPS-140-2 Level 3 hardware-certified security, a tamper-resistant physical security mechanism that prevents intruders from gaining access to, using, or modifying sensitive private keys held within the cryptographic module, and are designed to operate within high-volume enterprise deployments.\n\n""Our engineers worked closely with the hardware team at Thales for months to develop a custom solution specifically for the Bitcoin industry,"" said Gem CEO and Founder Micah Winkelspecht. ""The payments industry has been using this hardware technology for years. But we looked at every HSM on the market to find one that could support Bitcoin wallets, and none of them could do it, so we built it ourselves. Thales really came through for us, and the level of enthusiasm they have for our growing industry is incredible.""\n\nWith over 40 years of experience securing sensitive information, Thales e-Security -- a division of the $11B aerospace and defense giant, the Thales Group (EPA: HO) -- protects data for 19 of the 20 largest banks in the world and over 3,000 financial institutions worldwide, making it the largest provider of key security to the payments industry.\n\n""Bitcoin represents a compelling opportunity for both new entrants and traditional members of the payments ecosystem. As providers of the most trusted and widely deployed HSMs in the world, we are excited to work closely with Gem in this rapidly evolving market,"" said Richard Moulds, VP of Product Strategy at Thales e-Security. ""Gem\'s focus on comprehensive Bitcoin security, deep technical expertise, and collaborative attitude has enabled them to rapidly incorporate the use of our HSMs at the core of their solution. By taking advantage of unique capabilities of these machines, Gem is securing Bitcoin transactions in a way that matches and exceeds security best practices that are a pre-requisite in the payments industry.""\n\nJust as Thales has become the most recognized and widely used security provider for global payment transactions, Gem seeks to be the Bitcoin security provider of choice for the next wave of developers building Bitcoin apps and products. Their API optimizes the developer experience by providing an easy to use Bitcoin security platform that doesn\'t sacrifice security for convenience.\n\n""We empower Bitcoin companies to build incredibly secure products and services with our multi-signature platform. By abstracting away the hard parts of blockchain development, we offer our developers the simplest way to get up and running, giving them expert security by default,"" said Gem COO and former PayPal executive, Ken Miller. ""The additional steps we\'ve taken to generate and secure all Gem keys within FIPS certified HSMs is a first of its kind, and signals to the industry how serious we are about securing blockchain technologies.""\n\nGem\'s customers are equally pleased about the new HSM offering. Bitmo, a US based mobile payments company focused on incentivizing consumers and merchants through a seamless Bitcoin payment experience, will now be integrating Gem wallets into their platform. And last week, South East Asia\'s first multi-currency bitcoin wallet provider CryptoSigma announced they would be using the Gem development platform to secure their wallets. Gem\'s progression into hardware security fortified each company\'s decision.\n\n""Addressing our customers\' need for security and giving them full control and manageability of their coins is our number one priority,"" said CryptoSigma CEO Aaron Siwoku. ""Gem\'s platform offers our customers the security and flexibility they desire and allows us to focus on providing a superior product and user experience. Their addition of HSMs to store and protect all Gem keys just further reinforced to us how seriously they take protecting cryptocurrency.""\n\nBitmo Founder Michael Smallwood added, ""The decision to use Gem\'s multisig solution was a no-brainer for us. Not only was their API easy to integrate, but we felt great knowing that our funds would be secured by the strongest solution on the market. The news that Gem will now be securing keys inside of HSMs custom built for our industry was yet another reminder of why we made the right decision partnering with Gem.""\n\nKey features of the HSM integration and partnership with Thales include:\n\nPhysical security that includes the use of strong enclosures and tamper detection/response circuitry\n\nSupport for BIP32 Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key derivation\n\nUse of strong random number generated keys with the SECP256k1 elliptic curve to support interactions with the Bitcoin protocol\n\n""The year 2014 was all about multi-sig; now we\'re finally starting to see major adoption of that security standard by Bitcoin companies, and it\'s growing at an exponential pace,"" said Winkelspecht. ""2015 is the year of hardware security. The great news is they work perfectly together... like peanut butter and jelly.""\n\nFor more information about Gem, please visit: https://gem.co\n\nTwitter: @GemHQ\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gemhq\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/gem-hq\n\nGithub: https://github.com/gemhq\n\nInstagram: @GemHQ\n\nAbout Gem\n\nGem, founded in 2014 by Micah Winkelspecht, is a simple and secure Bitcoin platform that allows developers to build feature-rich blockchain applications in minutes using less than ten lines of code.

""The amount of Bitcoin that depositors have lost to these scams is probably many millions more.""\n\nTypically the scams succeed by exploiting not only people\'s greed, but also the urge to ""get rich quick,"" coupled with the inability to judge the legitimacy of web services to decide which financial sites are good or bad, said Bitcoin and cyber security expert Tyler W. Moore, co-researcher on the study.\n\n""Because the complete history of Bitcoin transactions are made public, we have been able to inspect, for the first time, the money flowing in and out of fraudulent schemes in great detail. It\'s like having access to all of Bernie Madoff\'s books for many of these scams,"" said Moore, director of the Economics and Social Sciences program of the Darwin Deason Institute for Cyber Security in SMU\'s Bobby B. Lyle School of Engineering.\n\n13,000 victims and counting in four different kinds of scams\n\nThe researchers identified 41 scams occurring between 2011 and 2014, in which fraudulent sites stole Bitcoin from at least 13,000 victims, and most certainly more.\n\n""We found that the most successful scams draw the vast majority of their revenue from a few victims,"" Vasek said.\n\nThe researchers were only able to track revenues for about 21 percent of the scams, which would indicate that the amount of Bitcoin actually stolen most likely far exceeds $11 million.\n\nThe findings emerged when the researchers ran a Structured Query Language database dump of all relevant Bitcoin transactions, then analyzed Bitcoin addresses (the account numbers) of both victims and the siphoning transactions of scammers.\n\nThe researchers presented their findings, ""There\'s no free lunch, even using Bitcoin: Tracking the popularity and profits of virtual currency scams,"" at the 2015 19th International Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference, Jan. 26-30, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Vasek is a graduate student and Moore is assistant professor, both in the Lyle School\'s Computer Science and Engineering Department.\n\n""The amount of fraud being attracted by Bitcoin is a testament to the fact the virtual currency is gaining in legitimacy,"" said Moore. ""But scams that successfully hijack funds from depositors may end up scaring away consumers who will fear using Bitcoin for their legitimate digital transactions.""\n\nThe research was partially funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\'s Science and Technology Directorate, Cyber Security Division, and the Government of Australia and SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific.\n\nThere are 13.7 million Bitcoin in circulation, according to blockchain.info. The number of Bitcoin transactions exceeds 100,000 per day.\n\nFour scams, each with varying lifespans, strategies and success\n\nVasek and Moore identified four common scams by tracking forum discussions, where scams are often initially advertised and later exposed, and by tracking web sites.\n\n—High-yield investment programs, otherwise known as online Ponzi schemes, which promise investors outlandish interest rates on deposits. The scammers lure both unsuspecting victims as well as those fully aware it\'s a Ponzi scheme who hope to cash out in time. Of all the scams, this type has taken in the lion\'s share of money from victims. The biggest of these scammers was Bitcoin Savings & Trust, formerly First Pirate Savings & Trust. When such schemes collapse, as they eventually do, and often within about 37 days, they\'re replaced with a new program, often run by the same criminals, say the researchers. These scammers consistently pay out to their investors far less than they take in.\n\n—Mining investment scams are classic advanced-fee fraud, taking orders and money from customers but never delivering any mining equipment—specialized computer processors and electronic devices for mining Bitcoin. These retailers typically endure for 145 days, much longer than Ponzi schemes. Vasek and Moore looked at Labcoin, Active Mining Corp., AsicMiningEuipment.com and Dragon-Miner.com.\n\n—Victims make deposits into scam wallets under the promise the service offers greater transaction anonymity. If the deposit is small, scammers leave the money, but if it rises above a threshold, scammers move the money into their wallet. Services such as Onion Wallet, Easy Coin and Bitcoinwallet.in each surfaced with transfers from victims siphoned to one address held by a scammer.\n\n—Exchange scams, such as BTC Promo, CoinOpend and Ubitex, offer PayPal and credit card processing, but at a better exchange rate than competitors. Customers soon find out, however, they never get Bitcoin or cash after making payment. Longer-lived exchange scams survived about three months. Wallet and exchange scams exploit the difficulty in judging the legitimacy of web services.\n\nThe study is not a comprehensive review, the researchers note, as they were limited to those scams for which they could determine a minimum estimate of the prevalence and criminal profits of the scams after analyzing the public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions ever executed.\n\nThe researchers conservatively estimate that $11 million has been taken by scams, while only $4 million has ever been returned. Most of the successful scams catch a few ""big fish,"" say the researchers, who pay the bulk of the money into the scam.\n\n""Bitcoin scams pose a problem for more than the victims who directly lose money,"" Moore said. ""They threaten to undermine trust in this promising technology, and cast a chilling effect on those interested in trying out new services. By mining the public record for fraudulent transactions, we hope to deter would-be scammers and assist law enforcement in cracking down on the bad actors.""\n\nExplore further: Overstock.com installs bitcoin ATM at Utah headquarters', 'You might have asked someone recently, what the heck is going on with Bitcoin? Or maybe you are still wondering what Bitcoin is, or even questioning its relevancy?\n\nA lot has changed in the last year in the cryptoworld — most notably Bitcoin’s price. It’s a good time to dissect a few points about Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market, things I couldn’t help but notice during my first year in the industry.\n\nThe biggest point is the false dichotomy in the general perception of Bitcoin. I’d like to unpeel this and provide a deeper evaluation of the industry, because people who commit the mistake of false dichotomy do themselves a disservice by not taking a full view of what’s going on.\n\nFirst, a definition to help us here:\n\nA false dichotomy is a logical fallacy that presents two opposing views, options or outcomes in such a way that they seem to be the only possibilities: that is, if one is true, the other must be false, or, more typically, if you do not accept one then the other must be accepted.\n\nAs one of the few people here in Seattle who frequently (attempts) to explain Bitcoin to non-technical people, and being the one who handles customer interactions for Coinme, I have noticed a problem. The media, tech executives and the general public talk about Bitcoin mostly by committing to a false dichotomy. Quite amusingly, I find people either preach the positives of Bitcoin or they dismiss it, like Gagnam style. One side thinks we’ll live in a libertarian world where Bitcoin will eventually be an anonymized currency to rule us all, and the other believes it’s only for crooks in the shady, dark interwebs. “It’s doomed to fail!” they pronounce enthusiastically.\n\nWell, neither are true.\n\nStudying Bitcoin and watching the markets adjust has taught me a very important lesson: nothing ever ends up being 100% of what you think it will be. Innovation cannot be predicted, and the future cannot be known ahead of time. Correctly predicting the future is simply a function of luck. But seeing around corners can be a function of deep listening, observing and learning. So the best action for success is to (safely) get as close to the something as possible, and learn as much about it as you can, so you start to identify where the world is heading. Only then are you equipped with perspectives on where to invest your time, capital and energy.\n\nWhen I read about a new random Bitcoin startup here, or a larger funding round there, I start to understand how things are changing, and in what direction. The more I talk with highly technical people who mine Bitcoin or build on top of the blockchain, I learn we’re very early in something very special. Even though we aren’t living in Crypto-utopia, there is a subtle rumbling deep within the Internet we should pay attention to.\n\nMy time around Bitcoin has shown me that our world will not be changed as much by the cryptocurrency you read about today as by the underlying technology.\n\nJoichi Ito, who has been involved in building many layers and pieces of the Internet — from helping start the first commercial Internet service provider in Japan to investing in Twitter and helping bring it to Japan — recently wrote about the similarities between Bitcoin and the internet:\n\nThe similarity is that Bitcoin is a transportation infrastructure that is decentralized, efficient and based on an open protocol. Instead of transferring packets of data over a dynamic network in contrast to the circuits and leased lines that preceded the Internet, Bitcoin’s protocol, the blockchain, allows trust to be established between mutually distrusting parties in an efficient and decentralized way. Although you could argue that the ledger is “centralized”, it’s created through mechanical decentralized consensus.\n\nWhat Ito is saying is that we could actually be witnessing the early stages of the next phase of the connected world, a time not so dissimilar to what we experienced in the early 1990s.\n\nAn often quoted example of a false dichotomy was when the Internet first gained media attention in the early to mid-nineties. Back then, many people thought it was a fad, hard to understand and a waste of time and money. They simply couldn’t get their head around the fact that there were more than just two possibilities: A (success) or Z (failure).\n\nAnd therein lies the fallacy of the false dichotomy around Bitcoin.\n\nIt’s clear to me and many others in the industry we are still in the “pre-browser” era of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. It’s there, but you really don’t know how to interact with it. What happens when we reach the “Netscape” moment of Bitcoin? What we witnessed with the Internet was the invention of the web and the browser, which commercialized the internet and brought with it every major corporation in the world. By ending up somewhere between A and Z, the world changed forever.\n\nIt’s clear to me and many others in the industry we are still in the “pre-browser” era of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. It’s there, but you really don’t know how to interact with it. What happens when we reach the “Netscape” moment of Bitcoin?\n\nCould Bitcoin — the currency — pop and crash?\n\nYes, it could.\n\nBut seeing investment dollars in the cryptocurrency/bitcoin market grow each quarter, one has to believe that if Bitcoin the currency pops, then something else will emerge even better and more suited for the general public.\n\nWhat will that be?\n\nI could take a guess but in reality I don’t have a clue. Yet committing the false dichotomy sin here is a grave mistake. An important point to understand is that Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency, is just one app that runs on the blockchain technology. People well-versed in bitcoin are familiar with the blockchain, the underlying open-source technology (or rails) that bitcoin the currency runs on. Looking deeper, the blockchain stack presents interesting solutions to problems which have hindered our society for quite some time — outside of finance. Issues such as trust, security and identity can be improved with applications built on the blockchain.\n\nIn fact, here are a few other areas where the blockchain serves as underlying technology.\n\nOpenBazzar: An open peer-to-peer marketplace not controlled by any specific organization such as eBay or Craigslist. Ideas like this, using a decentralized platform to exchange goods and services, could change e-commerce as we know it.\n\nFactom: A conceptual framework for a system that secures and proves the authenticity of records, documents or other important types of data that are later enshrined on the Bitcoin blockchain. This could transform how we handle record-keeping online.\n\nCounterparty: An example of digitizing property and identity. Developers are starting to build networks that work in parallel to the Bitcoin blockchain to perform tasks that the bitcoin network can’t, but that make use of the bitcoin blockchain to, for instance, timestamp or validate work.\n\nThe reality is that no one really knows what will happen next — that is why it’s called innovation. But something is going to happen in this area to improve our lives and I hope you don’t get caught up in thinking only A or Z is possible.\n\nMost likely somewhere in between A and Z we’ll see Bitcoin technologies enhance our digital lives. There’s more down there than you think.\n\nNick Hughes is the Director of Business Development for Knotis, a local commerce startup in Seattle, and is also General Manager of Coinme, a new company expanding bitcoin and digital transactions into the physical realm via Bitcoin ATM’s.

But Bitcoin isn\'t one of those currencies, he said in a Reddit AMA today. At least not in its current form.\n\nGates extolled the value of digital currency in his AMA last year as well, explaining that since many poor people in developing countries don\'t have access to traditional banking, it\'s not financially worth it for banks to put branches in areas where the amounts stored and transferred are so small, leaving the poor at a huge disadvantage when it comes to exchanging, saving, and accessing money.\n\nMobile banking costs almost nothing to process, so it actually is worthwhile for banks to provide the service. That means digital money offers an opportunity for mobile banking, and hence the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is so gung-ho about giving people more ways to store their money.\n\nSo why not Bitcoin? The billionaire philanthropist and redditor called it ""an exciting new technology"" in today\'s AMA, but he doesn\'t think it\'s a very good tool to make banking easier in emerging markets because it\'s so volatile and because it\'s anonymous:\n\nWe don\'t use bitcoin specifically for two reasons. One is that the poor shouldn\'t have a currency whose value goes up and down a lot compared to their local currency. Second is that if a mistake is made in who you pay then you need to be able to reverse it so anonymity wouldn\'t work.\n\nBitcoin has been touted as a potentially revolutionary banking tool for the poor, and it\'s likely Gates\' remarks will rankle the community. But he did offer an alternative, highlighting the uses of local digital currency like Kenya\'s M-Pesa over anonymous cryptocurrencies:', 'Medical marijuana users will be among the earliest users of bitcoin, according to bitcoin entrepreneur Peter Klamka. Klamka’s Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company, Bitcoin Brands, has placed a bitcoin ATM machine at one medical marijuana dispensary and is in the process of placing another two in the Grand Rapids area.\n\nKlamka’s bitcoin ATM machine, made by Portland, Ore.-based Skyhook, provides the customer a QR code which they get scanned at the checkout counter by a clerk using a bitcoin payment tablet.\n\nThe (payment) technology is like a gift card,\n\nKlamka says.\n\nPayment Tablets for Dispensaries\n\nKlamka has provided his three medical marijuana dispensaries with bitcoin payment tablets to facilitate bitcoin transactions.\n\nYou can buy your bitcoin, buy whatever you want to buy in the dispensary, pay and leave,\n\nsays Klamka, who calls his bitcoin payment system “bitMD.” As the name of his service indicates, he envisions pharmacies signing on to accept bitcoin payments for prescriptions and medical testing services.\n\nThe dispensary gets a percentage of the sales from the bitcoin ATM machine, Klamka says. Since his first ATM machine has only been on site for two months, he did not wish to release sales figures. Klamka has provided the bitcoin processing tablets free to his first three medical marijuana dispensaries to encourage them to have bitcoin ATM machines. “It is a very modest investment for me building this business,” he says. He does not know how much longer he will provide the tablets for free as the business grows.\n\nLocations Have a Choice\n\nKlamka also offers to sell the bitcoin ATM machine to locations (machines go for $1,500), but so far, they have preferred to take a commission and let Klamka operate the machine. Medical marijuana dispensaries are receptive to bitcoin because they realize some customers view bitcoin as a more private way to pay than using a credit or debit card, Klamka says. In addition, marijuana merchants have had trouble getting credit card companies to authorize marijuana purchases.\n\nIf and when credit card acceptance becomes easier for medical marijuana buyers, Klamka says bitcoin transactions are still faster and don’t have transaction fees or potential chargebacks.\n\nAlso read: Houston, Texas receives first bitcoin ATM\n\nMarket Needs Education\n\nKlamka got the idea to focus on medical marijuana after trying to place bitcoin ATM machines and realized there is a general lack of understanding of the benefits bitcoin offers merchants. In addition to marijuana dispensaries, he has found interest in some martial arts gyms. He also expects gaming businesses to be receptive to bitcoin ATM machines.\n\nIt (bitcoin ATM vending) really needs to be in niche markets, and it’s got to be sold. It really hasn’t evolved into a business yet.\n\nKlamka estimates there are about 300 bitcoin ATM machines globally.

A former federal agent has shown in a courtroom that he traced hundreds of thousands of bitcoins from the Silk Road anonymous marketplace for drugs directly to the personal computer of Ross Ulbricht, the 30-year-old accused of running that contraband bazaar.\n\nIn Ulbricht\'s trial Thursday, former FBI special agent Ilhwan Yum described how he traced 3,760 bitcoin transactions over 12 months ending in late August 2013 from servers seized in the Silk Road investigation to Ross Ulbricht\'s Samsung 700z laptop, which the FBI seized at the time of his arrest in October of that year. In all, he followed more than 700,000 bitcoins along the public ledger of bitcoin transactions, known as the blockchain, from the marketplace to what seemed to be Ulbricht\'s personal wallets. Based on exchange rates at the time of each transaction, Yum calculated that the transferred coins were worth a total of $13.4 million.\n\n""You mean direct, one-to-one transfers?"" prosecutor Timothy Howard asked Yum.\n\n""Yes, direct, one-to-one transfers,"" Yum responded.\n\nYum\'s testimony represents another damning line of evidence connecting Ulbricht to the Silk Road, on top of a journal detailing the Silk Road\'s creation found on his laptop and testimony from a college friend who said that Ulbricht confessed creating the site to him. Ulbricht\'s defense has argued that despite initially founding the Silk Road, the 30-year-old Texan quickly gave it up to the site\'s real owners, who later lured him back just before his arrest to serve as the ""perfect fall guy."" But Yum\'s analysis showed that Ulbricht was receiving bitcoin transfers from Silk Road servers in data centers near Philadelphia and Reykjavik, Iceland long after his defense has argued he turned over control of the site.\n\nMore broadly, Yum\'s testimony confirms what most savvy bitcoin users already know: that the cryptocurrency is by no means untraceable or anonymous by default. Although using bitcoins doesn\'t necessarily require revealing any identifying information, all bitcoin transactions are traced on the blockchain, the same widely distributed list of transactions designed to make counterfeiting bitcoins impossible. If someone can identify a user\'s bitcoin addresses—in Ulbricht\'s case, by seizing the laptop he was actively using at the moment of his arrest—then they can often be used to trace his or her transactions.\n\nIn fact, Berkeley computer science researcher Nicholas Weaver had already shown that he was able to follow more than 29,000 bitcoins from the Silk Road to Ulbricht\'s laptop based only on publicly available information. The prosecution, with access to Ulbricht\'s hard drive, had far more success. Nearly 500,000 bitcoins of the 700,253 bitcoins were transferred from September to November 2012, explaining their relatively low total exchange rate.1\n\nRemarkably, that total trail of drug-tainted coins represents more than four times as many bitcoins from Silk Road Ulbricht\'s laptop than have yet been found and seized in the Silk Road investigation. It\'s still not clear from Yum\'s testimony where the rest of them ended up.\n\nThe Silk Road advertised that it protected users by ""tumbling"" coins, mixing them up between users to prevent anyone\'s transactions from being identified. But Yum\'s testimony makes it clear that withdrawals from the site could still be tied to users, particularly after the FBI possessed the Silk Road\'s servers. Bitcoin anonymity tools like Bitcoin Fog or Dark Wallet could further obscure bitcoins\' digital trail, but it doesn\'t seem that Ulbricht himself used those protections, instead transferring the coins directly to his own wallet. Based on earlier testimony from FBI agents, Ulbricht likely believed his hard drive\'s encryption would prevent anyone from tying his bitcoin addresses to his real-world identity.\n\nIn its cross-examination of Yum, Ulbricht\'s defense attorney Dratel called into question whether Yum had done his analysis single-handedly or relied on a coworker at FTI consulting, the government contractor that now employs him. When Yum admitted that he had done only about 40 hours of work on the analysis and that 60 hours had been performed by a cryptologist named Matthew Edman, Dratel moved to have Yum\'s testimony struck from the record as ""hearsay,"" or testimony that\'s not based on firsthand evidence. But the trial\'s judge Katherine Forrest denied the motion, ruling that Yum was sufficiently involved in the analysis.2\n\nAt another point, Dratel asked Yum whether Ulbricht might have simply used the Silk Road as a bitcoin wallet, an alternative explanation for his withdrawals from the site.\n\n""Yes, it could be done,"" Yum admitted, in a skeptical tone. ""I wouldn\'t maintain my bitcoins that way.""\n\n1Correction 1/29/2015 6pm: An earlier version of this story identified Nicholas Weaver as a Berkeley professor, rather than a researcher.\n\n2Updated 1/29/2015 6pm with the defense\'s cross examination and motion to strike Yum\'s testimony from the record.', 'Coinbase, which announced earlier this week it had launched the first regulated Bitcoin exchange in several states and territories of America, including California and New York, seems to be lacking regulatory approval from both states, according to local regulators.\n\nDepartment of Business Oversight (DBO) commissioner Jan Lynn Owen, issued a ""consumer alert"" on Coinbase\'s licensing status in California, where she made clarifications on what she qualifies as ""erroneous reports.""\n\nThe document reads:\n\n""Numerous press accounts about Coinbase’s Jan. 26 launch of Coinbase Exchange erroneously reported the Exchange has received regulatory approval from the State of California. The California Department of Business Oversight has not decided whether to regulate virtual currency transactions, or the businesses that arrange such transactions, under the state’s Money Transmission Act. California consumers should be aware Coinbase Exchange is not regulated or licensed by the State.""\n\nIn addition to California\'s DBO\'s statement, Matthew Anderson, a spokesman for Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of New York\'s Department of Financial Services, declared on Wednesday 28, that Coinbase doesn\'t hold the proper licenses to operate as a Bitcoin exchange in the state.\n\nAnderson told The New York Times\' DealBook:\n\n""We are working with several companies, including Coinbase, on licensing, and will continue to move forward expeditiously. That said, we have not yet issued any licenses to virtual currency firms.""\n\nCommenting on NYDFS\' statement, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, said his company will carry on its work with Lawsky\'s office ""on all Bitcoin matters involving consumers, merchants and the recently launched Coinbase Exchange."" Ehrsam further noted that his company is looking forward to ""continuing to work together on the completion of New York\'s BitLicense.""\n\nCoinbase claims on its website that its service is currently supported in 25 states and territories of America, ""where Coinbase is either licensed to engage in money transmission, where it has determined that no such license is currently required, or where licenses are not yet being issued by respect to Coinbase\'s business.""\n\nSo far, the startup had received money transmission licenses or equivalents from 15 states and territories, including Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Puerto Rico, Washington and West Virginia.\n\nNumerous Bitcoin companies are waiting for the issuance of Lawsky\'s BitLicense, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who unveiled on January 23, their new Bitcoin project - a ""next generation Bitcoin exchange"" dubbed Gemini, which will be registered and banked in New York.\n\nDid you enjoy this article? You may want to check out these ones:', 'Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss aren’t shy about issuing bold predictions for Gemini, their recently revealed bitcoin exchange project.\n\nCalling it the ""NASDAQ or Google of bitcoin"", the president and CEO, respectively, believe Gemini will be the fully regulated, fully compliant and fully banked institution the US bitcoin ecosystem needs to develop to its full potential.\n\nIn a new interview with CoinDesk, the brothers – prominent bitcoin investors and two of the largest-known holders of bitcoin – opened up about Gemini, discussing why they feel the exchange can become the market leader in what has been an increasingly active part of the bitcoin space.\n\nWhile neither addressed competitors directly, both alluded to how their approach with Gemini stands in contrast to the other exchanges currently in the US market, even those that have recently dominated the headlines with claimed regulated offerings.\n\nCameron summed up this difference, stating:\n\n""We aren\'t interested in trying to find a way to be semi-operational, or operate around the fringe or hack our way in.""\n\nCompetitors aside, Cameron and Tyler focused much of the interview on evoking their long history as participants in the bitcoin space in comments that suggest that, to them, the fight to build a market-leading US exchange is personal.\n\n“Without a doubt, we spent a great deal of time properly securing our own bitcoin,"" Tyler said. “We felt like we were uniquely positioned to speak to those issues and take the friction and the risk and all the things that we saw and convert them into a product and an experience that we thought would be unmatched.”\n\nTyler went on to suggest that Gemini was also the result of their failed efforts to find a team that would be able to handle the tall task of launching an exchange in what to date has been an uncertain jurisdiction for entrepreneurs.\n\n""We’re investors as well – we would have invested in a bitcoin exchange by now if we were confident they were covering all the bases,"" Tyler added.\n\n\'Best and brightest\' team\n\nAs perhaps an extension of this passion, Cameron and Tyler took pains to express their belief that they have assembled the best possible team for the job.\n\nOver the course of the interview, Cameron and Tyler rifled through the names of their employees’ former employers, mentioning the likes of sharing economy startup Airbnb, Google Wallet and tech giant Microsoft, among others.\n\nThe list of professionals now employed by Gemini includes Cem Paya, the former CSO of Airbnb and a former information security engineer at Google, and Michael Breu, a former head of security at investment management firm Bridgewater.\n\n""Our team members are individuals who have been in companies where there were lots of assets, and valuable information at stake,"" Cameron pointed out.\n\nGemini’s no-expense-spared approach to personnel is also apparent in its choice of partners.\n\nFor example, its regulatory lawyers hail from Katten Muchin Rosenman, while its anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) policies were crafted by specialists K2 Intelligence, a firm that helps banks comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and Patriot Act, while crafting policies for corporate governance and compliance.\n\nTyler said:\n\n“We’ve worked very hard to understand what it would take to be a fully licensed, regulated entity in all the states, and we’re making sure we get this right. We’re not pretending we’re kids that don’t have to play by certain rules, I don’t think that’s the right way to approach it.""\n\nAll of this adds up to what the brothers suggested would be a complete product ready for market upon its debut.\n\n“There’s regulation, compliance and then there’s security and product,"" Tyler noted. ""A lot of people just look at product and forget the other three. We consider all four of these issues as crucial to being a successful business.""\n\nFront-door approach\n\nTyler suggested that Gemini’s proactive approach to regulation is another differentiating factor that positions it for success, as the project has actively courted the approval of regulators since its founding in February 2014.\n\n“We felt like the only way to do this was to open up an active dialogue with the regulators, which we have done, and to establish a relationship with a US regulated bank, which we have done, and approach this with a security-first mentality from day one,” Tyler said.\n\nWhile both are optimistic about launching the exchange in the first quarter of 2015, they were adamant that Gemini’s launch would be contingent on the passage of New York’s BitLicense proposal, which is expected to be finalized this month.\n\n“We’re not launching until we’re licensed,"" Tyler remarked. ""Most people are taking a different approach, but we\'re not interested in operating without a license.""\n\nBoth brothers also lauded the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and its superintendent Ben Lawsky for their progressive approach to bitcoin regulation, calling the state the “clear choice” for their headquarters.\n\nGemini is currently in the process of securing licenses in all necessary US states, according to Tyler, and he anticipates the exchange will serve the entire nation at launch.\n\nSecurity first\n\nWhen discussing exchange security, Cameron and Tyler here too turned attention to the team behind Gemini, noting that these personnel were the first appointed.\n\n""When you talk to these security guys, usually they’re brought in when the train has already left the station, so it\'s refreshing to them that we\'re including them from the beginning,"" Tyler said.\n\nHe went on to frame this as different than existing exchanges, noting his belief that the exchange industry has already seen a few events he billed as “wake-up calls”.\n\nWhile boastful about the security team behind the exchange, Cameron and Tyler were also open when discussing the specific security components that would be available at the exchange when it opens.\n\nPlanned features to be included in the Gemini exchange include multi-signature wallet support and two tiers of offline storage, dubbed \'cold\' and \'cryo\' for \'cryogenic\' – both with different service-level agreements for access and withdrawal time.\n\nThe user-facing website will include two-factor authentication, and further internal-only sections of the site will use separate access controls that are not exposed to Internet.\n\nGemini will also mandate the coordinated actions of multiple employees to transfer any funds out of offline storage.\n\nFlagship exchange\n\nBoth Cameron and Tyler stressed their belief that the lack of a leading bitcoin exchange in the US continues to set back the country’s bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n""To us it just seemed like an obvious hole in the infrastructure. If people can\'t easily and safely buy and sell bitcoin, it will be harder to build the application layer of native bitcoin apps and fuel the bitcoin economy in America,"" Cameron said.\n\nPart of this approach entails being inclusive with the exchange by using design elements that appeal to individuals and institutions with a big-tent philosophy.\n\n""We are definitely targeting both individuals and institutions. Our offering will be suitable for anyone from individual hobbyist traders all the way to professional institutional traders. We are very much focused on servicing the investor crowd,"" Tyler explained.\n\nThe brothers expressed their belief that this balance, while difficult, is achievable provided they seek to differentiate from existing offerings.\n\n""If you look at terminal-like systems, they look overly technical and unfriendly, and they don\'t need to be that way in order to be powerful,"" he continued. ""We think we can achieve a clean, simple and friendly product that is also super powerful and robust.""\n\nPassion project\n\nStill, Cameron and Tyler further sought to make the case that they were the right leaders for the Gemini project given their experience and background.\n\nBoth stressed that Gemini has been their day-to-day project for the last year, and that other planned efforts to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) are unlikely to deter them from their work.\n\n“Gemini is what we are and have been working on 100% of the time,” Tyler added.\n\nCameron went on to reiterate that the Gemini project, while set in motion last February, is the result of long-standing frustrations the brothers have had since the earliest days of the ecosystem.\n\n“We didn’t start looking at this when Mt Gox collapsed, or when it stopped withdrawals,"" he continued. ""We started looking at this problem almost two years ago when Cyprus happened, when Mt Gox had a DDoS attack and was down for 12 hours.”\n\nPast issues aside, both indicated that they are eager to move forward toward helping secure a brighter future for the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nCameron concluded:\n\n""We\'re building the best product experience possible. If you want to think of this like how Google would approach bitcoin, so be it, Gemini is not going to be like anything else out there.”\n\nImages via Gemini\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The cell apparently used the dark web and bitcoin to cover its tracks.\n\nWulkan found a dark web site that urged supporters to donate bitcoin to the cause. The message, posted by a user named Abu Mustafa, stated that bitcoin donations are accepted by the cell.\n\n""There was smoke, and now we have found the fire,"" Wulkan told Haaretz.\n\nThe bitcoin address listed on the site received around 5 BTC before being shut down. Furthermore, Wulkan said this could be a one-off fundraising effort, or even a hoax or a joke.\n\nThis is not the first time ISIS has been associated with bitcoin. A blog affiliated with the militant group discussed the possibility of using bitcoin for fundraising last year, but no evidence of bitcoin use by ISIS was ever found.', ""This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.\n\n... the advisers need to know at this point you're the toughest at least is my Casey well for my pay ... is exciting me ... pleasure so my Pursell was to buy just care about the color that this was ... what would you run you that the weather prices move this fall when shopping this tweet stories of people being busted for drug related charges has ... also said Crazy while with madness around ... the reason is because the technology behind it ... is absolutely groundbreaking new busy revolutionary shift in the way we can stop the financial system ... some people who are placing bets on pick ... up some very serious investors who do so in ... various ways not just any bitcoin doodles that investing in companies that develop services around ... with people updating that this technology ... at some point is can become a critical part of financial destruction have any replacing the dollar this is that they never one focuses on the draw to focus on the currency businesses will ... go on earth is going to use a currency that dances around a love the place ... and if people like that all of the credit cards why are they going to go and take on this crazy thing that scuttle a sweet associations with it ...

There were scams we couldn\'t find or verify ... We think presenting our findings as they are, a lower bound, makes a lot of room for us and others to further quantify scams in this space.""\n\nVasek, who researches computer security at Southern Methodist University, co-wrote the paper with Tyler Moore, an assistant professor in computer science at the same institution.\n\nPainstaking search\n\nThe paper, titled There\'s No Free Lunch, Even Using Bitcoin: Tracking the Popularity and Profits of Virtual Currency Scams, has been presented at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security conference taking place in Puerto Rico this week.\n\nVasek and Moore combed online repositories of scam accusations, including a mega-thread of scams, hacks and heists on the Bitcointalk forum that has been maintained since 2012, as well as the subreddit r/bitcoin, BadBitcoin.org and CryptoHYIPs.com.\n\nThis process required the researchers to painstakingly go through forum threads post by post, even translating messages that were written in languages other then English, as well as visiting the websites that scammers created to publicise themselves.\n\n""We went through every single post to determine if the scheme was a scam, any associated bitcoin addresses with the scheme, and any associated scams,"" Vasek said.\n\nUsing this method they found 349 scams, which were then whittled down to 192 deceptions after excluding phishing, malware and pay-for-click websites, which fall outside the scope of the study.\n\nThe researchers then extracted bitcoin addresses linked to the frauds, enabling them to look at transactions from victims to fraudsters recorded on the blockchain.\n\nThe paper groups scams into four categories: wallet software, exchanges, mining \'vapourware\' and \'high-yield\' investment programmes that operate as Ponzi schemes.\n\nThe authors notably exclude the collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox from their study because it\'s unclear if the platform was originally set up to defraud users or was simply poorly run.\n\nAs Vasek put it:\n\n""Being bad at running a business does not make you a scammer, even if many people accuse you of that on the Internet.""\n\nCatching the \'big fish\'\n\nThe most lucrative scams were Ponzis, which yielded $7.3m to the fraudsters that the researchers were able to track. Mining scams were next, generating $2.9m in ill-gotten gains for the cryptocurrency hustlers. Exchange and wallet scams, by comparison, yielded a paltry $455,000 and $360,000 respectively.\n\nThe Ponzi schemes, which are called \'high-yield investment programs\' (HYIPs) in the paper, come in three different flavours, ranging from \'traditional\' programs to bitcoin-only variants. Moore has previously conducted research into HYIPs.\n\nNotably, it is the schemes that cross over from the traditional HYIP world to the bitcoin realm that are the most successful, the paper finds. Nine scams bagged $6.5m-worth of coins in the 12 months from September 2013. These include schemes like Leancy, Cryptory and Rockwell Partners.\n\nThese \'bridge\' HYIPs also keep the carousel going the longest, operating on average for 125 days before folding. Bitcoin-only schemes, like First Pirate Savings and Trust, by contrast run for only 37 days on average.\n\nThe analysis also produced insights into what makes a scam successful. The deceptions that generated the most money did so by getting a handful of ""big fish"" victims to pay in the majority of the funds.\n\n""For a scam to be successful, it appears that it must catch the few \'big fish\' who will pay the bulk of the money into the scam,"" the authors write.\n\nVasek said the opportunity to use the blockchain to quantify the amount of money fraudsters were making was one reason she and Moore conducted their research.\n\n""The blockchain creates an opportunity in that transactions may often be tracked, which could make it easier to assess the true risk posed by scams,"" the authors write.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, the complaints paint a detailed picture of the frustrations long faced by CoinTerra customers.\n\nThe full complaints, which were received with personal information redacted, showcase the breadth of customer accusations that CoinTerra failed to meet advertised shipping dates, build hardware to the desired specifications or issue refunds in a timely manner.\n\nOne customer complaint reads:\n\n“On 12/1/2013 I purchased a computing unit for a total of $6,288.35 (including all applicable taxes and shipping). The unit purchased had stated performance numbers. Once the units started shipping, they were not close to meeting the performance numbers promised.”\n\nThe customer goes on to state that Cointerra missed suggested refund times, before ceasing communications with the customer, in what was just one of many customer service frustrations detailed in the assembled remarks.\n\nOthers showcase the alarm many customers felt at the lack of response from the company.\n\n“Just yesterday, 7th May, I had called the company more than 30 times, and after calling and calling, I finally was able to talk to someone, however, I got disconnected halfway,” another complaint reads.\n\nEscalating issues\n\nThe complaints indicate that customer frustrations were heightened in April, when the company continued to delay refunds for TerraMiner IV products.\n\nOne filing illustrates the lack of faith among customers at the time that their concerns would be addressed by CoinTerra.\n\n“After repeatedly asking when my funds would be returned, today (22nd April), Cointerra replied with this: ‘We are drawing near to your queue position for your refund, but before we process it I wanted to reach out to you regarding an offer,’ which clearly indicates that they have made no effort to return my funds,” the filing reads.\n\nPre-order refund updates related to the mining unit would continue through June. During this time, CoinDesk continued to receive complaints about the refund process from customers as well.\n\nResponses suggest international customers also appealed to the FTC for assistance with refunds.\n\n“It's a terrible shopping experience in US. I had believed American company will never do anything against law,” reads another complaint. “It seems I have made a mistake.”\n\nReimbursement unknown\n\nThough customer complaints indicate many customers may still be owed funds from CoinTerra, it remains unclear when or if buyers will be reimbursed.\n\nStatements from the company as recently as 8th October suggest 70% of customers had been reimbursed as of that time. However, some customers have reported failing to receive refunds as recently as 2nd January.\n\nCoinTerra would later announce that it had defaulted on its secured notes and that payments made to customers would be suspended indefinitely.\n\nCoinTerra filed for a Chapter 7 bankrupcty on 24th January, citing between $10m and $50m in liabilities and including a lengthy list of creditors that included commercial partners like data services provider CenturyLink, US bank Wells Fargo and C7 Data Centers, along with a wide range of private citizens and investors.\n\nStill, CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar has remained steadfast in statements that suggest he believes the company did its best to satisfy its customers, but that it was sometimes hindered by its own success.\n\n“We were probably among the only few who delivered on time and in most cases ahead of time,” Iyengar told CoinDesk on 14th January. “We have no customers who wanted their hardware that didn’t receive it.”\n\nImage via CoinTerra\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Customers have also reported running afoul of fraudulent users in the past.\n\nKangas told CoinDesk that he believed the hackers used an unknown kind of malware that was able to bypass existing security measures, and took personal responsibility for the LiveChat intrusion.\n\nHe explained:\n\n“The attacker used that LiveChat access to spread some kind of Windows executable, which probably was some new kind of keylogger software which is not yet detected by virus protection mechanisms. If the user got that executable installed, with some social engineering, the attacker managed to get access to different accounts of those victims.”\n\nCustomer postings on LocalBitcoins suggest that at least one user reportedly lost funds through other bitcoin-related accounts, but that user later reported that discussions with the company were underway on a possible solution.\n\nAwareness prevented spread\n\nAccording to the company, three users were identified as having lost funds during the hack. Reports indicate that a lack of two-factor authentication may have been to blame for the fraudulent withdrawals, and LocalBitcoins advised customers to ensure that they are using such security measures to protect their accounts.\n\nKangas said that thanks to the combined efforts of LocalBitcoins employees and users of the site, information about the LiveChat compromise was disseminated relatively quickly, noting:\n\n“Due to fast actions by the Localbitcoins support staff and Localbitcoins.com community, the impact of the attack remained limited. The amount of users affected was fairly low due to general awareness of the users.”\n\nKangas added that the company is looking at how they can improve their internal security protocols to avoid similar incidents in the future, and suggested that the incident was illustrative of the costs and challenges of participating in a digital economy.\n\n“This is not only a challenge to bitcoin users, but to all Internet services and users in general, about how to make those attacks equally expensive for those attackers,” he said.\n\nMalware image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

If you have come this far, I suggest that you read till the end.\n\nEven if you are not a VC or angel, you are still in the right place on the Internet, for I am about to add some perspectives that can help you make informed decisions towards investing in Bitcoin. More specifically — investing in Bitcoin Tech. Please note that Venture capital funding for Bitcoin based startups tripled in 2014, and 2015 is off to a phenomenal start.\n\nThere are Venture Capitalists who invest in technology, logistics, finance, food, transportation, and even in the adult toy business (just kidding – thats extremely hard). Then there are early adopters among the VCs who are investing in Bitcoin tech. After all, VCs are people too, right? So it only makes sense to extrapolate the innovation diffusion curve to Venture Capitalists, just the way we apply the curve to the general population.\n\nOoh, the shoes are shiny! Let me step into the shoes of VCs for a brief moment.\n\nThere are three business opportunities that are immediately evident.\n\nWallets — storing the bitcoins\n\nExchanges — converting fiat to digital currencies.\n\nPayments — sending and receiving what’s stored or been exchanged, with merchants. But I refuse to believe this. To be more precise, I refuse to believe that there are only three possible ways to make (more) money as an investor in Bitcoin tech. The Three Limitations or Dependencies The above three angles of investing in Bitcoin have a few limitations. The Return on Investment (ROI) is dependent on adoption of the Bitcoin usage The ROI is dependent on the the premise — “Bitcoin Will Become Money Someday“ The ROI in exchanges depend on Transaction volumes and Payments Volume. The Most important one — The Adoption All of these are inter-related, but the key driver is the Adoption Rate. What good is a currency if people aren’t using it? In the end, it is the payments volume that is going to drive price appreciation (or depreciation) and exchange volume. That’s not all. Payments Volumes are dependent on adoption rate. Adoption rate is dependent on the Bitcoin Public Sentiment, about which I wrote a few days earlier. What if there is a different angle to investing in Bitcoin? Venture capitalists who have traditionally invested in Technologies like the ones shown in this Forbes Midas list, invest in social networks, dating apps, IoT, AirBnB like ideas, match making ideas, Uber-like ideas and the ilks. All these investors and investment firms have one thing in common — They invest either in the Team or the Technology or the Revenue potential. In the case of investing in Bitcoin tech, the investment angle has mostly been Financial or the Revenue Potential. I can’t help but say this is the way I see such revenue or finance centric investing. The best representation of my opinion can be summed up in this cartoon by Steve Sack, of Cagle Cartoon. So, a better approach would be to invest in the team or the technology value. Where is the Scope for Innovation? One reason with which VCs can justify their financial and revenue centric approach is that the Bitcoin tech is Open Sourced. So the question is where is the scope for innovation? Here is the answer. Apache Hadoop is open source. This is the major underlying tech in Big Data.\n\nLinux, especially Ubuntu is open source tech.\n\nBitcoin and the protocol is Open Source.\n\nBlockChain is Open Source. All these technologies have taken Earth by storm in the past. There is a new eligible candidate on the block, the Blockchain. This is where the scope of innovation is. This where your investments can make a difference and actually more profit. Image Credit: TruthDig.com. Steve Sack, Cagle Cartoon, The Minneapolis Star Tribune.

01/30/2015,"['Bitcoin is sometimes thought of as the prime anonymous cash of the Internet, believed to be as untraceable as an under-the-table payment to a babysitter or a drug dealer. But the dramatic trial of Ross Ulbricht, a 30-year-old man accused of running the contraband Silk Road marketplace, is finally putting those misconceptions to rest.\n\nFederal agents said they were able to trace 3,760 bitcoin transactions over the course of a year to servers seized in the Silk Road investigation, Wired reports. A former FBI agent named Ilhwan Yum testified in court that he followed more than 700,000 bitcoins from the Silk Road marketplace to Ulbricht’s personal wallets.\n\nHow did Yum do it?\n\nWhen federal agents arrested Ulbricht in San Francisco in Oct. 2013, they also seized his laptop before he could encrypt it. That machine gave Yum access to Ulbricht’s bitcoin address, which he then compared against what’s called the blockchain, a master list of bitcoin transactions kept to prevent counterfeiting. Comparing the two let Yum track bitcoin transfers from Silk Road servers near Philadelphia and Reykjavik, Iceland to Ulbricht’s bitcoin wallet.\n\nIn Ulbricht’s case, the transactions show Ulbricht was trading bitcoins during the same period that his defense attorney said he wasn’t involved with the website. But more generally, it shows that bitcoin isn’t always as anonymous as it’s made out to be.\n\n[Wired]', 'A technology is called “disruptive” if it creates a new market that first disturbs and then displaces an earlier technology. Bitcoin is potentially such a technology and much more. The fact that it can disrupt the largest and most interconnected marketplace in the world—money, banking, and finance—makes it perhaps the most promising investment opportunity of our age.\n\nUnlike our current increasingly unstable and unpredictable financial system, Bitcoin has 21st century technologies at its very core. The digital currency and clearing network is open source, mobile, peer-to-peer, cryptographically protected, privacy oriented and native to the Internet. The fusion of these technologies allows for a level of security and efficiency unprecedented in the world of finance. These are some of the areas in which Bitcoin-oriented technology can directly compete:\n\n$2 trillion annual market for electronic payments,\n\n$1 trillion annual e-commerce market,\n\n$514 billion annual remittance market,\n\n$2.3 trillion hedge fund market,\n\n$7 trillion gold market,\n\n$4.5 trillion cash market,\n\n$16.7 trillion offshore deposit market.\n\nIts potential is not going unnoticed. After it had been praised by tech moguls as Bill Gates (“A technological tour de force.”) and gmail founder Paul Buchheit (“Bitcoin may be the TCP/IP of money”), the money started speaking. We saw investments into Bitcoin by top venture capital brass such as Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman, and Fred Wilson; by billionaires such as Richard Branson (Virgin) and Li Ka-shing (richest man of Asia); by iconic executives such as Vikram Pandit (Citigroup), Max Levchin (PayPal), Tom Glocer (Reuters), Bill Miller (Legg Mason Capital); and recently also by large cap companies such as Google, New York Stock Exchange, USAA (American bank & insurer), BBVA (2nd largest bank of Spain), and NTT Docomo ($75b Japanese phone operator).\n\nThe core value proposition of this network is the fact that, in the words of IBM executive architect Richard Brown, “Bitcoin is a very sophisticated, globally distributed asset ledger.” What Brown and others hint at is that Bitcoin will in the future be able to serve not only as a decentralized currency and payment platform, but also as the backbone for an “Internet of property”.\n\nThis entails a decentralized global platform, smartphone- accessible, on which companies and individuals can issue, buy, and sell stocks, bonds, commodities and a myriad of other financial products. The effect will be to remove much of the current bureaucracy and barriers to entry, presenting a huge opportunity for the world’s 2.5 billion unbanked people.\n\nThis raises the question: why Bitcoin, and not some other cryptocurrency? The answer may lie in the network effect: of all the cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is the one with the highest adoption rate and the strongest security. The combined computing power of the Bitcoin mining industry serves as a protective firewall around the payment network, with a replacement cost of nearly $1 billion—and it is growing quickly. In short: no other cryptocurrency is as secure as Bitcoin. This attribute in itself attracts more capital, which in turn makes the network even more secure and performant.\n\nBecause of its robustness, the Bitcoin network is now the reference protocol for the new paradigm in finance. And just like TCP/IP became the mainstay for the Internet of information, the Bitcoin network will likely become the value anchor for the Internet of money and finance. Speed may be provided by off-chain or side-chain transactions, but for the high-value transactions of tomorrow, Bitcoin could very well become the security-providing reference currency.\n\nSo, how much of all this potential is already realized?\n\nWell, since inception of Bitcoin in 2009 to January 2011, its market cap grew to $1.5m. From there, it rocketed to $145m in January 2013, to reach $4 billion in early 2015.\n\nDespite a steady price decline in the 12 months following the fall 2013 rally, year on year adoption trends markedly point upwards: as of early 2015, there are 7.9 million bitcoin wallets (+148%), the trading volume on exchanges is $23 billion (+57%), Bitcoin is accepted by 82,000 merchants (+128%), there are 320 bitcoin ATMs (up from only 4), and the network hash rate is 335 pth/s (+8,500%).\n\nEnticed by its great potential, the investments in the Bitcoin ecosystem are taking off rapidly. In 2013, little over 40 VC deals were made that raised a total of $96 million. That number nearly quadrupled over 2014, with $335 million invested. Based on these numbers, VC’s such as Marc Andreessen compare the Bitcoin system in 2014 with where the Internet was in 1993.\n\nFurthermore, the Bitcoin price has been rising at an exponential rate. This can be explained mostly by the fact that it is a scarce commodity (maximum supply is 21 million) with a rapidly growing user base. Here are a few possible scenarios for the future value of one bitcoin:\n\nThe scenarios projected above are, of course, not cast in stone. Bitcoin faces several risks going forward. These include:\n\nThe emergence of a much better digital currency that steals its market lead,\n\nAn undetected bug in the system,\n\nA sustained attack by an organization with substantial computational resources,\n\nA coordinated clampdown on Bitcoin by a multi-national entity such as the G20.\n\nHow serious of a risk do these challenges pose? Let us examine them.\n\nA better currency is possible, but experience shows that disruptive protocols—such as SMTP for email and TCP/IP for Internet—have proven to be very resilient once adopted by a critical mass of the population.\n\nAn organized attack on the network is possible but expensive, and there are many potential defense mechanisms.\n\nAs with any software application, the discovery of bugs may destabilize the system, but the open source nature of Bitcoin allows for many eyeballs to help track problems, and many brains to help figure out a solution.\n\nThat leaves government clampdown as the most likely risk to Bitcoin. However, with many regulators implicitly or explicitly already accepting Bitcoin, and the robust, decentralized nature of its network, such a move would have little long-term structural impact and is thus unlikely.\n\nBecause of its strong network effect, the outcome of the Bitcoin story is likely to be binary: either it will experience a downfall as it is superseded by a vastly superior technology, or the value of bitcoins will rise dramatically over the coming years as an increasing share of the global population adopts the currency.\n\nIn any case, to me it’s exceedingly clear that the technology of the cryptocurrencies is here to stay. Bitcoin does not appear to be a fad or bubble, nor merely a one-off hedge against gold. With a risk-reward proposition this attractive, holding a small percentage of bitcoins in one’s portfolio as a speculation on increased adoption may be one of the wisest investment decisions of our age.\n\nThis article originally appeared in yBitcoin magazine.', 'Bitcoin’s ideological foe is becoming its saving grace.\n\nTo many Bitcoin enthusiasts, the decentralized currency’s allure was that it was designed to exist beyond the reach of government regulation. Free from central banks, its value wasn’t tied to government policies or geopolitical factors.\n\nBut now it seems the very regulation its creator or creators (since we don’t actually know who first minted Bitcoin) guarded against is what’s now buoying the cryptocurrency’s price.\n\nThe arrival of regulated US Bitcoin exchanges, as well as impending plans to create a BitLicense in New York, have sent the price of Bitcoin up 30% in the past two weeks. Even the Federal Reserve alluded to Bitcoin in its report on the payment industry’s future, pledging to keep an eye on virtual currencies. It’s been a nice respite for Bitcoin believers after the virtual currency was called the worst investment of 2014, following a nasty tumble from the $1,000-plus highs reached at the end of 2013 to January lows of less than $200.\n\nBut regulation comes neither quickly nor easily, particularly in the US. The Winklevoss twins, Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss (of Facebook fame), recently said they are awaiting approval from New York’s top financial regulator for a license to operate a new exchange. The entrepreneurial twins are also still in a regulatory holding pattern over a separate Bitcoin ETF they have been working on for at least two years.\n\nBitcoin platform Coinbase recently touted the launch of what it called the “first regulated Bitcoin exchange in the US,” following multi-million-dollar investments from big financial firms such as the New York Stock Exchange and BBVA. But very soon after, officials from California and New York warned consumers the exchange was actually not regulated by their state laws.\n\nCoinbase cites so-called money transmitter licenses in states including Alabama and Arkansas—which were created decades ago to allow companies like Western Union to send and receive money—as part of the reason it considers itself regulated. But it’s still working to get licenses in large states such as New York, where it says it falls into “a regulatory gray area.”\n\n“We are working with several companies, including Coinbase, on licensing and will continue to move forward expeditiously,” Matt Anderson, a spokesman for New York’s Department of Financial Services, tells Quartz. “That said, we have not yet issued any licenses to virtual currency firms.”\n\nWhile the details remain in flux, Coinbase’s strategy to seek regulation seems necessary. If Bitcoin becomes standardized and regulated, it could potentially become as ubiquitous as the credit card. That means big payoffs for Bitcoin-related companies—and for the VC funders behind them.\n\nRegulation will help bring Bitcoin into the mainstream so it’s “easy and accessible for the average person,” Coinbase’s head of government affairs John Collins tells Quartz.\n\nThat’s a far cry from the language that once excited people about Bitcoin’s potential as a truly independent currency. But when it comes to creating a brand new currency, sometimes it pays to play by the rules.', 'Ryan X Charles has been let go from his post as cryptocurrency engineer on social platform Reddit.\n\nThe developer, who only this week demonstrated his proof of concept for peer-to-peer bitcoin payments on the site, announced the news in a Reddit post, saying:\n\n""I have complete confidence in the new leadership, but cryptocurrency is no longer in their plans. ""\n\nHe added that he was ""fairly confident cryptocurrency will return to Reddit in the coming years"", but that it would ""have to wait a while for things to calm down"" – a reference to the company\'s current situation after the sudden departure of CEO Yishan Wong.\n\nThe developer kept a positive tone and wished ""the best of luck"" to ""everyone who will get to witness the new era of reddit from the inside"". He finished off by saying that it had been ""cool to be part of the historic front-page of the Internet, at least for a while"".\n\nCharles made the news last September, when he left his job as lead developer at BitPay after being contacted by Reddit\'s former CEO.', 'Adam B. Levine calls “The Age of Cryptocurrency” by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey “a very positive book about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.”\n\n“This is the first book focused on a historical perspective of the first few years of Bitcoin.” —Adam B. Levine\n\nIn episode 182 of the Let’s Talk Bitcoin! (LTB) podcast, Levine speaks with the authors about the book and how they came to write it. Vigna and Casey are reporters with the Wall Street Journal, one of the first mainstream publications to cover digital currencies.\n\nThe authors say they began a daily roundup on the topic, called the BitBeat, when they were “pitched more stories than they could possibly cover.” The roundup runs—lately about twice weekly—as a regular part of WSJ’s MoneyBeat blog.\n\nThe goal of the book, according to Casey, was to look at the positives and negatives of cryptocurrency technology as both a foundation and a platform. He said:\n\n“It’s hard to deny, and you even get some of the skeptics out there admitting, that the technology is pretty groundbreaking and quite revolutionary.”\n\nThe two wanted to “explore all the possibilities of the blockchain and not get locked into a silly debate about whether the currency should be worth ‘this’ or ‘that.’”\n\nVigna’s perspective in the two years while writing the book went from “this is an interesting, almost quirky story, ... to thinking ‘wow, this is really revolutionary.’” Now he says he doesn’t see it as revolutionary anymore, but “almost as evolutionary, an inevitable next step in how money is handled.”\n\nBy the end of writing the book, he says he and Casey “came to see Bitcoin differently.” They wrote a chapter about Bitcoin 2.0, a topic which he now sees after publication as “probably the most important” topic, going “beyond Bitcoin’s utility as a currency.”\n\nLevine points out that “this is the first book focused on a historical perspective of the first few years of Bitcoin.” Before now, authors have focused on writing “the nuts and bolts of ‘what is Bitcoin?’”\n\nVigna and Casey conducted a lot of book research and many interviews, talking to “as many of the cypherpunks” as they “could get their hands on,” except for the ones who “didn’t like to talk.”\n\nThe one person they felt most fortunate to speak with was Hal Finney, said Vigna, whom they talked to before his death in the fall of 2014. They had to go through Finney’s wife because Finney couldn’t speak. The couple gave the authors access to all of Finney’s emails with Satoshi Nakamoto from when they were just starting to set up Bitcoin in early 2009.\n\nThe authors want to show that Bitcoin didn’t come “out of thin air,” and that “there’s a history to [digital currency].” Casey says,\n\n“Citibank at some stage in the \'90s was trying to make its own digital currency. There was a big move to create the technology that would be there to facilitate e-commerce. The credit cards ultimately won. They figured out a way to do that online and ... at that moment, you get the consolidation of Wall Street with commercial banking. [...] We end up with this ‘too big to fail’ banking model and credit cards online, and it all kind of blows up in 2008—quite fortuitously at the time that Satoshi Nakamoto releases his white papers.”\n\nThey talk about all the different groups that came together in order to make Bitcoin what it is today. The “rowdy, anti-establishment utopians,” the “tech for tech’s sake” crowd, the “proverbial suits” of Silicon Valley, and finally those of Wall Street. In the words of Vigna:\n\n“In a very short time, you’ve had extremely different groups of people all get hooked by this thing. And even though they may not agree with each other, they all reinforce each other. ... And then you have people from the outside of it, like Michael and I, journalists. ... We’re not ‘Bitcoiners.’ We’re journalists, trying to tell a story.”\n\nAmong these groups, says Casey, lies a tension-filled division of opinion—a “fault line”—between those who prefer centralization and those who prefer decentralization. The hardcore libertarians want nothing to do with centralized authority, while the regulators want to centralize everything. “To make [Bitcoin] work and bring it mainstream,” he says, “will [require] an ongoing negotiation, a conflict resolution process between these different factions.”\n\nThe discussion moves on to mining. Casey says some people think that we’re simply moving centralization from one group of people, the banks, and to another group of people, the miners—who themselves are becoming more concentrated and more powerful.\n\nThis argument is “somewhat articulate,” he says, but it “fundamentally misunderstands” the aspect of the dynamic that changes the game completely—Bitcoin has a “self-correcting nature.” Casey concedes that mining is a problem and that there have been scams, but “somewhere along the line,” he believes, “the innovative process that has been unleashed is going to resolve this.”\n\nA Washington Post review of the book says that Vigna and Casey, in the “most thorough and readable account of the short life of this controversial currency, ... resist the common temptation to hype their trendy subject.”\n\nWhile positive, the Post brings the optimism expressed in the LTB podcast down a notch. Author Daniel Gross writes, ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aren\'t really challening the global economic order"" (referring to the subtitle of the book). He says:\n\n“[Cryptocurrencies] remain marginal, unstable and little understood, and their spread has done nothing to chip away at the dominance of the Federal Reserve and ... the currencies managed by those enormously powerful central banks attached to enormously powerful governments.”\n\nThe Post also quotes less optimistic passages from the book, including the authors’ conclusion that “Bitcoin will end up something less than the stateless, third-party-less utopian dream of its most passionate supporters.” In the end, say the authors, according to Gross, Bitcoin may do no more than force upon the present, inevitably centralized financial system “some much needed competition and discipline.”\n\nThe LTB podcast ends with each author reading a chosen section from the book. Vigna tells about an Afghan girl who enrolls in a digital literacy program and studies what women in the country are not allowed to study—the internet, technology, and blogging. She begins her own blog, writing movie reviews for a site that pays its female contributors in Bitcoin. The girl is able to do what few women in Afghanistan are able to do: earn her own income, keep it in her own account, and “learn to stand on her own feet.”\n\nCasey chooses a story about Argentina, where he lived for six years. The country, once the world’s 7th richest, is now ranked near 80th. Corrupt governments have eroded trust in all but paper currency, and Casey must complete a shady backroom deal in order to sell his Argentine apartment and somehow transfer US$280,000 in paper bills to his bank account in the United States.\n\nThe moral of Casey’s story is about trust, an aspect of Bitcoin that provides one of its core strengths. The cryptocurrency’s very existence disrupts the foundations on which people have historically built trust. Some find this frightening. Others find it comforting.\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\n\nDid you enjoy this article? You may also be interested in reading these ones:', 'Bitcoin is without a doubt the best economic invention of my lifetime. Created six years ago by a person (or persons) identified as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a game changer for two important reasons. The first is its practical use. Using Bitcoin, it is possible to send and receive payments anonymously and instantly without any intermediation charges, such as storage and transaction fees by the financiers. Second, and perhaps most crucial of all, Bitcoin operates outside the interest-based financial system.\n\nIn order to understand why charging interest is so injurious to society it is fundamental that we recognize its extreme power. In 1836, an American lawyer named John Whipple, made this stunning observation: ""If 5 English pennies... had been... at 5 percent compounded interest from the beginning of the Christian era until [his] time, it would amount in gold of standard fineness to 32,366,648,157 spheres of gold, each eight thousand miles in diameter, or as large as the earth."" For more than three millennia, the Torah, the Bible and Koran forbade charging or paying interest on money. Our spiritual traditions knew of its destructive potential for society. Only since Jeremy Bentham and Adam Smith advocated it in the late 1700\'s has charging interest gradually become acceptable. And we have all seen the effects of that bumpy ride of bust and boom, including the Great Depression and the severe economic inequality of our present time.\n\nThough the financial sector, whose affluent members thrive on profits received from interest, will tell us that interest and transaction fees are a necessary lubricant of business, the fact is they have become a major parasitic burden on society. A recent study by economists, Adam Cole, Jon Bakija and Bradley Heim, found that the top financial professionals account for 60 percent of the top 0.1 percent of income earners in recent years. According to a recent Credit Suisse Report, the top ten richest percent own 87 percent of the world\'s wealth and at the very top, the one percent of the world hold nearly half at 48.2 percent. Just four years ago, research by Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, confirmed that the top 1 percent of Americans owned 40 percent of the nation\'s wealth. In fact, the world\'s financial elite, those who earn their income not by producing anything, but by living off their interest-accruing investments, have so skillfully rigged the financial rules in their favor that just 85 of the richest people on earth are worth nearly as much as half of the people of the globe. Obviously, they didn\'t earn all this money by doing hard work.\n\nThe invention of Bitcoin flew in the face of all that maddening inequality by establishing a novel means of credit exchange that rejected the harmful practice of money being made on money. Though based on groundbreaking computing technology, it was actually a throwback to the traditional clay and metal coin systems that first arose with the dawn of Mesopotamian agriculture about 11,000 years ago. Instead of using physical objects for trade purposes, however, Bitcoin fostered trustworthy encrypted electronic bits as currency. Like the ancient modalities of trade, it carried no interest, storage or transaction costs. Once again, the people had a truly free medium of exchange for goods and services. Its use grew like wildfire by young and old Internet users.\n\nBut all of that is now in danger of being destroyed by the machinations of the financial elite who see a way to cash in on Bitcoin\'s popularity. Under the pretense of protecting the digital currency from nefarious purposes such as drug dealing and the funding of terrorist activities, twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, are trying to gather support for the first regulated Bitcoin exchange. The wealthy Winklevoss twins are best known for their successful $65 Million lawsuit against Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg. It is their contention that Bitcoin\'s democratic and open-source technology is a hindrance to its true potential. As evidence, they point to Bitcoin\'s tumbling value and to recent highly publicized thefts through hacking. Yet they are firmly behind the buying and selling of Bitcoin with interest-bearing money. The result will be to absorb an independent exchange medium into yet another mechanism for amassing more wealth for a small group of rich people. Following the Winklevoss twins\' advice will essentially destroy this equalizing, interest-free transactional system.\n\nConverting Bitcoins to ""real money"" may seem innocuous but it belies a more insidious threat, the silencing of the populace. In our lifetime we have seen our already weakened democracy receive its final deathblow with the 2010 landmark Supreme Court decision in Citizens United vs FEC. The ruling made it clear that Americans are living in an oligarchy in which corporations are considered individuals and can vote with their deep pockets for the people they choose to serve them.\n\nBitcoin matters so much because it dispenses with that cynical approach to human value. By operating outside the purview of a government rendered suspect by its close ties to Wall Street, Bitcoin had remained independent and empowering. It had no trademark. Its intellectual property belonged to no corporation or individual. Instead, through the collective efforts of courageous, decentralized developers and users, it had wrought a truly emergent, equalizing counter-balance to a deeply un-equalizing monetary system.\n\nIt is crucial to our economic and political freedom that we expose and resist the intrusions of the Winklevosses of the world into the interest and transaction-free domain of Bitcoin and its iterations. Let Bitcoin be free from government regulation so that it remains a bastion of democratic participation. And if the financial class is successful in shackling the invention by its convertibility to ""real money"", do not give up hope. It merely means we must move on to the next software-based currency on the open-sourced model. Now may be the time for a new iteration of the encrypted digital currency. We could call it ""Freecoin"" and it would operate under the same principles of crowd-sourced independence and private trading as the original Bitcoin.\n\nWe must not allow this new ""Freecoin"" to be owned or bought and sold with real money. For the moment that a currency becomes interest-bearing and is subject to transaction and storage charges, it becomes a tradable commodity itself and it loses its equalizing value. It becomes simply another tool for the super rich to dominate the masses. Hallelujah for the perhaps unwittingly ingenious, freethinking young people and developers who are the scourge of fat cats the world over. The Bitcoin model is not just a sophisticated electronic exchange. It is part of a great bottom-up evolution that empowers people to trade the fruits of their labor, free from the yoke of financial and political tyranny. Bitcoin or its child, ""Freecoin"", and the progressive humanistic ideology they represent are our best chance to finally win back economic freedom and with it, true democracy.', 'Hong-Kong based Gatecoin Limited launches new Bitcoin exchange with ""bank-grade security measures,"" including segregated client bank accounts, multi-signature cold storage, as well as continuous monitoring and audit from an external IT security firm, the company announced.\n\n""Segregated bank accounts means that there are two accounts within the same bank under Gatecoin’s name; one operating to collect fees and process operating expenses, and the other to collect and store clients’ deposits, as well as process withdrawals,"" Inggrid Yonata, PR and communications manager at Gatecoin, told CoinTelegraph.\n\nShe added:\n\n""Clients\' cash deposits are protected from anything related to operational failures resulting from mismanagement or potential fines from regulators. Basically, clients’ funds will not be touched or used as part of the operational expense account.""\n\n“Segregated client bank accounts dramatically minimize counterparty risks,” said Gatecoin CEO Aurélien Menant, “and while it is common practice within the forex industry, it is still non-existent in the crypto space.”\n\n""This feature implies cooperative and transparent relationships with our banking partner, which is very hard to reach as a Bitcoin exchange, because banks are very reluctant to accept this official corporate account setup for Bitcoin exchanges,"" Yonata said.\n\nIncubated by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks and Tsinghua University, Gatecoin was built on solid ground to be in agreement with regulations. The startup operates with a Hong Kong Money Service Operator license, and is rigorously complying with AML/KYC rules. This compliance is exactly why their “banking partner agreed to provide us a unique banking structure in the Bitcoin exchange industry,"" she stated.\n\nFounded in 2013, Gatecoin is a digital currency exchange platform that allows users to trade Bitcoin in USD, Euro, and HKD. The startup is planning to integrate Ripple into its trading platform in the next few weeks, and is currently offering 15 days of free trading for new users to celebrate its public launch.\n\nThrough its partnership with Bitcoin-approved Mastercard issuer Aerapay Limited, Gatecoin said it will be rolling out a white-labeled debit card ""that can be used to shop anywhere in the world without incurring foreign transactions fees,"" and which is said to be ""the first debit card that users can reload online instantly using bitcoins."" Gatecoin will be operating the Bitcoin-loaded, white-labeled prepaid cards, which will be resold to merchants.\n\nThe company is looking to expand its business to the US and Europe, and is currently working on obtaining the proper licenses. Gatecoin\'s expansion plan for the coming months include providing new payment methods to reduce the price and delays for fiat currencies deposits and withdrawals, developing innovative digital currency trading services, and facilitating bitcoin spending.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Farmington Police say a demand for $2,000 in computer “bitcoin” comes in the mail, threatening the addressee and his or her family. It claims to know their address, schedule, and how to kill them, undetected.\n\nPolice say the letter, postmarked in Austin, Texas and Jacksonville, Florida describes how to open a bitcoin account and deposit money to the account, and where to send the extortion payment. The letter even includes a “Note to Law Enforcement,” bragging that the perpetrators can never be caught.\n\nFarmington Police say they’ve contacted the Postal Inspector and the FBI, and are told that there have been more than a dozen similar complaints in Fairfield County, They tell recipients not to send any money and to call local police to report the incident.\n\nAs forwarded by Farmington Police, parts of the letter read as follows:"", ""Genesis Mining has grown quickly amidst a rapidly-expanding cloudmining market and is now the SHA and Scrypt mining industry leader. The German-directed, Bermuda-registered corporation offers not only Bitcoin mining contracts but also diversifies its hashing power to “the most promising altcoins” such as Dogecoin and Litecoin.\n\nIn a follow up to our previous interview back in July of 2014 with the company, we decided to check up on Genesis Mining to see how the suppressed bitcoin price has impacted their operations, the current state of the cloudmining industry, and what is in store for the company in 2015. We caught up with founder Marco Streng to get the inside scoop.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Given the current climate where other cloudmining providers are shutting down their operations, how is the situation for Genesis Mining?\n\nMarco Streng: Due to our efforts to get the best electricity rates possible for our distributed facilities by the time we started our operations, we are in the very favorable position to still keep our operation running while others have been forced to cease operations.\n\nThis is an important point because this gives our valued customers the ability to keep mining and take the reward other miners give away by turning off their machines. Our team is constantly seeking and discovering new ways to increase the efficiency of our mining operations in order to remain the most competitive player in the market.\n\n“[W]e are still very flexible and can theoretically continue running the operation for bitcoin prices even below 100 USD/BTC.“\n\nCT: Is there are a price range needed for Genesis to continue offering cloud mining?\n\nMS: The situation is getting a lot tougher, no question. Although we are still very flexible and can theoretically continue running the operation for bitcoin prices even below 100 USD/BTC, I think the more important point is having the highest efficiency possible. Efficiency and electricity rates determine the competitiveness and will clear out the mining market.\n\nBy properly positioning our brand, we feel there is tremendous opportunity to remain a leader in this exciting industry and continue to serve our devoted customers. We remain committed to providing our customers with a solution to cater to the evolving market and will continue to innovate and do everything in our power to keep our customers satisfied.\n\n- Genesis Mining Farm\n\nCT: What can Genesis Mining do against problems created by lower value coins/difficulty increases?\n\nMS: If difficulty is going up or the value of the Bitcoin is going down there is not much any mining provider can do and a decrease of profitability is the unfortunate consequence. However Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency and our proprietary system and technology gives our users the unique opportunity to also diversify the hashpower over other altcoins.\n\n“As the market turns back into a bull market it will quickly become a huge rush on mining hardware again [...].“\n\nAlthough there are currently some fears of the overall market due to the decrease in value, we are here for the long term and remain bullish on the future of cryptocurrencies. As the market turns back into a bull market it will quickly become a huge rush on mining hardware again since it would then be an opportunity to still acquire discounted Bitcoins while the price is increasing in value.\n\nI can say with great confidence that people who already have the hashpower by that time enjoy a strong position while others desperately try to buy mostly sold out mining products. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen something like this occur in the industry and it likely won’t be the last. While others are stuck focusing on the short term, we positivity see things in the long term and are excited for what the future holds for our customers, Genesis Mining and the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nCT: Where are your miners located and how do you achieve maximum efficiency?\n\nMS: Our locations are spread across the globe at places where electricity and infrastructure for large scale mining are the best possible. We have put a lot of effort in searching for the right places and are continuously increasing our global operation. There is currently a big competition for industrialized mining operations to find the electricity sweet spots on the planet, because the one who owns them will be strategically in the best position to get the highest profit out of mining.\n\nCT: There are concerns that the cloud mining market suffers from a lack of transparency and operational risk from pricing the contracts efficiently. Has the volatiliy impacted your pricing?\n\nMS: The prices for cloudmining are mainly based on prices for hardware components and electricity, both are independent of the price of Bitcoin. This gives users a unique opportunity especially if the Bitcoin price and mining prices are diverging. We all remember this very clearly by the end of 2013, where the price skyrocketed and everybody was trying desperately to buy sold out mining contracts or hardware.\n\n“ [W]e are engaging a lot to protect the market from bad actors and want to build a validation system that helps especially newer and uneducated people to stay away from [scams].“\n\n- CTO, Stefan Schindler in front of a big batch of miners in Iceland\n\nCT: Do you think a lower bitcoin price increases the risk of mining centralization?\n\nMS: It increases centralization, yes, because it is not possible for home miners to compete against large scale mining operations that use the economy of scale and optimized infrastructure to stay in the market while the rest have to drop out. The risk for centralization however is rather limited in my opinion, since we, as a cloudmining operation are distributing the mining power even more than by sending miners to the clients directly.\n\nCT: How much would you say does it cost to produce a bitcoin in dollars?\n\nMS: Regarding the price of the production of 1 BTC due to mining, it is very difficult to say. As you know mining depends on mainly 2 random variables, the difficulty and the bitcoin price. Since both of them are impossible to predict, doing a forecast on both simultaneously is even worse. The only thing I can say is that if you can reach the highest degree of efficiency due to best hardware and infrastructure, you can keep in the market while others have to drop out and\n\ntherefore gain the rewards that others leave by stopping to mine.\n\nAlso since mining costs are uncorrelated to the Bitcoin price and also currently at the lowest price ever, it will quickly become a big opportunity and a huge rush on mining as soon as the price goes up. Clearly, the ones who are already mining then will be better off than others who try to desperately buy sold out mining contracts or hardware.\n\n“Unfortunately lower Bitcoin prices are more in favor for bad actors and ponzi schemes.“\n\nCT: Do you think the lower price has some positive effects like weeding out the bad actors in the industry?\n\nMS: Unfortunately lower Bitcoin prices are more in favor for bad actors and ponzi schemes since they are not really mining in the back and therefore don't have to cover any electricity and maintenance costs to run the machines. However, we are engaging a lot to protect the market from bad actors and want to build a validation system that helps especially newer and uneducated people to stay away from these. It is not only important for the affected customers, it is also important for the whole industry who would suffer from bad reputation that wrong business would bring to the market.\n\nCT: Do you think we will see a mass shift to 20nm and 16nm FinFET nodes in 2015?\n\nMS: An investment into 20 nm or pioneering even lower nanometer scales comes with very high costs and risk, but also with big opportunities. Although I know reaching the lowest possible scale is a big goal for all manufacturers, I only think very few companies will have enough capital to take the risk of such a large investment. You also have to consider the case that the chip that comes out later does not work and therefore, you lose a lot of money. I am confident though to see FinFET designs during 2015.\n\n- Genesis Mining Farm\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

We have the opportunity to corner this market completely and this is our intention.""\n\nDSX, which launched in December, offers trading in bitcoin, litecoin, pounds sterling and euros. Customers can make deposits and withdrawals through SEPA or SWIFT transfers.\n\nePayments Systems has more than 200,000 customers and a transaction volume of $50m a month, according to Pari Andrade, the exchange\'s head of marketing.\n\nDual accounts required\n\nDeposits to the exchange have to flow through ePayments Systems. Customers of the exchange therefore have to create accounts on both platforms.\n\nThe relationship between DSX and ePayments Systems is complicated by a third company, Electronic Payments Association Ltd. Customers funds are currently routed through the EPA, also a Rymanov company, that works in partnership with an e-money issuer in Gibraltar.\n\n""The EPA is our distribution concept. In order to get a wallet, you have to become a member of this association,"" he said.\n\nThe EPA mainly serves online publishers and currency traders, who were an ideal market for a ""soft launch"" of the bitcoin exchange, Rymanov said. Within the next month, the EPA will be removed from the chain of transactions, allowing customers to deal directly with DSX and ePayments Systems, he added.\n\nThe same executive team runs both DSX and ePayments. Rymanov said he ran business development for Mergermarket, a financial information service that was part of the Financial Times Group when Rymanov worked there, in Central and Eastern Europe before starting ePayments.\n\nThe use of an FCA-regulated payment processor to accept deposits from customers for a bitcoin exchange is not a new manoeuvre. The longstanding but shadowy exchange BTC-e – its operators remain anonymous – accepts deposits from an FCA-regulated company called Mayzus Financial Services, for example.\n\nHowever, DSX\'s status as a registered agent of the regulated ePayments Systems adds a new layer of scrutiny to the exchange, although it does not confer FCA-regulated status on the exchange.\n\nUsers must create accounts and offer their identity information to ePayments Systems as part of anti-money laundering rules the issuer must follow.\n\n""Everybody who trades on DSX is subject to the same compliance procedures as the regulated entity,"" Rymanov said.\n\nThe fact that funds must flow through ePayments Systems before going to DSX will likely give potential customers of the exchange some reassurance, at least of their fiat funds, said Adam Vaziri, a director of consultancy Diacle, which advises on compliance and regulatory matters.\n\n""From a customer\'s point of view, they see the money they\'re depositing is with an authorised institution and flowing to a related party,"" he said.\n\nDebit card offering\n\nAnother novelty in the DSX/ePayments approach is the fact that customers can transfer funds from the exchange into a pre-paid MasterCard offered by the payment processor.\n\nThe card works like a debit card and can also be used to withdraw cash from ATMs. The spending limit on the card is $20,000 per day, while ATM withdrawals are capped at $3,000 daily, Andrade said.\n\nShe explained that funds on ePayments are insured by Lockton, an insurance brokerage headquartered in Kansas City. DSX is working to obtain insurance for funds on its platform and is in contact with underwriters in London, Andrade added.\n\nThe importance of regulation\n\nExchanges and bitcoin businesses in the UK have been unable to secure stable relationships with local banks.\n\nSwedish exchange Safello, in a notice to customers days before it was force to abandon UK Faster Payments by its bank, said it had done ""everything in its power"" to prevent the closure of its account, but to no avail. It did not reveal who its bank was.\n\nLast month the bitcoin hedge fund manager Global Advisors was forced to look elsewhere after its longtime bank HSBC gave notice.\n\nIn September, the London-based exchange Coinfloor ceased offering Faster Payments when its service provider Capital Treasury Services cut ties with its bitcoin clients after pressure from the banks it works with.\n\nRymanov is sanguine about his firm\'s prospects with UK banks:\n\n""Our banking relationships will hold up. This is the reason we take the regulated approach, the banks do not bank a company that handles bitcoins, it handles an entity that is regulated.""\n\nLondon image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

01/31/2015,"['Hello my cryptocurrency-lovin\' friends. I just want to have a casual chat, but not that casual, because I\'m worried about some of you. Some of you who may be operating under the assumption that Bitcoin is anonymous. It is not.\n\nThis is not a secret. I know a lot of you will be all, duh. Bitcoin.org very plainly states ""Bitcoin is not anonymous"" in its ""Things You Need to Know"" section. That\'s there because this is a very common misconception! Poop-chugging Bill Gates has it. It appears Ross Ulbricht had it, since FBI agents were able to trace $13.4 million in Bitcoin from the Silk Road to Ulbricht\'s laptop by tracing public transactions on the blockchain.\n\nWhile the agents used Ulbricht\'s computer to figure out what appeared to be his personal Bitcoin wallets, the fact that he made no effort to hide that information may speak to a misplaced trust in the anonymity of his Bitcoin-fueled drug empire, especially since he didn\'t use tools like Dark Wallet to further obscure his identity.\n\nUlbricht appears to have been pretty crappy at the whole anonymity thing in a number of different ways, but if he assumed that his Bitcoin transactions were anonymous, it wouldn\'t have been his dumbest mistake. After all, when you make a payment with Bitcoin, you\'re only identified with a cryptographic pseudonym. This is one of the selling points of the cryptocurrency for some people: It\'s harder to trace.\n\nThis pseudonymity does help people keep their transactions relatively private. It does not, however, make it impossible or even particularly difficult to find out who is doing what with the digital currency. Wired\'s Andy Greenberg explained how tracing Bitcoin transactions often comes down to simply knowing someone a snippet of information:\n\nAlthough using bitcoins doesn\'t necessarily require revealing any identifying information, all bitcoin transactions are traced on the blockchain, the same widely distributed list of transactions designed to make counterfeiting bitcoins impossible. If someone can identify a user\'s bitcoin addresses—in Ulbricht\'s case, by seizing the laptop he was actively using at the moment of his arrest—then they can often be used to trace his or her transactions.\n\n\n\nResearchers at the University of Luxembourg have highlighted methods to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin pseudonymity can be broken in a number of ways, from tracking payments to monitoring IP address nodes. And while tumblers and programs like Dark Wallet help, there is no bulletproof solution that makes Bitcoin impenetrable.', ""Coinbase used to be great. You signed up with an email address, bought bitcoins with dollars, or sold bitcoins for dollars. It was pretty simple. I recommended their service to literally every person who ever asked me how to buy Bitcoin.\n\nNow almost two years later, I've contacted the people I sent Coinbase's way and advised them that due to the company's recent (and extensive) violations of the ethics of the crypto world, I'd recommend ending any relationship with them.\n\nHere are the top five reasons why:\n\nCoinbase spies on their users' expenditures. News that Coinbase was tracking what their users did with their bitcoins after they bought and withdrew them came when gamblers reported their Coinbase accounts were being closed.\n\nCoinbase sent messages to the users whose accounts had been closed, including this paragraph:\n\n“In the event that your controls change and you are able to prevent such activity from occurring on your platform please let us know and we’d be happy to review your compliance program and evaluate your account to see if we can support it in the future.”\n\nCompliance program? What if your local grocer demanded you complete a compliance program to buy carrots? Or your gardener demanded such to get your hedges trimmed?\n\nIt is clear that doing good business – that is, simply giving the customer what he wants – is not at the heart of Coinbase's business model. They instead demand that the customer give them what they want.\n\nCoinbase employs former bureaucrats from the likes of “Homeland Security.” Bitcoin has been heralded since its founding as the tool that would finally allow people to cut the ties binding them to elitists like politicians and bankers.\n\nBut Coinbase wants to keep – and strengthen – these ties of the past.\n\nIn fact, they have an entire swath of employees staffing what they call their “government affairs department.” Among them is John Collins, a former advisor in the “US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.”\n\nIf the words “Homeland Security” strike terror into your heart, that's because you're paying attention. The words have been used to wreak all sorts of atrocities in America, such as highway checkpoints (detention points), “TSA” airport screenings (gropings and naked body scans), neighbor-on-neighbor spy campaigns (“If You See Something, Say Something”), and other untold acts of terror.\n\nAnd Coinbase now calls someone recently active in these atrocities one of their own.\n\nCoinbase terminates accounts of people who make trades they don't personally like. Think of all the things you don't personally like. Perhaps spaghetti. Perhaps ballet. Maybe you don't like water polo.\n\nThe administrators at Coinbase, for their own personal reasons, don't like that people use drugs, and they don't like when people buy and sell things without permission. For this reason, they've reportedly shut down the account of a user they claimed used bitcoins to purchase cannabis, and another user who sold bitcoins to others via LocalBitcoins.\n\nGod help us if other peoples' personal preferences dictate what we can and cannot buy.\n\nCoinbase is actively acquiring and storing users' credit histories in a database. If you didn't read one of Coinbase's more recent “terms of service” updates, you may have missed it entirely: overnight, Coinbase decided that buying and selling bitcoins wasn't sufficient. They now track and store users' personal credit histories, as well.\n\nCoinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, explained the move to CoinTelegraph in early January:\n\n“Regulations require us to verify the identity of our customers. We use a number of methods to accomplish this, such as requiring identification and addresses and in many cases rely on third parties for verification. Because some of these third parties include credit history checks as part of their process we changed our user agreement to inform our customers of this possibility so that we could maintain transparency with them.”\n\nOne can only ask, what does this have to do with their business? Coinbase doesn't make loans. Maybe having your credit history accessed by strangers isn't a problem for you. But then that leads to the question – if Coinbase wants its users' credit histories so badly, why didn't they just ask for them? Why is the program not opt-in?\n\nCoinbase's new exchange is entirely political (and hence off-limits to almost everyone in the world). The majority of online Bitcoin exchanges are global – you can use them from anywhere and trade with people from anywhere. It's great, and it gives access to the best trades, too.\n\nBut Coinbase decided that consumer demand is not nearly as important as courting political bed fellows when they decided to “license” their recent exchange. As a recent and highly-upvoted cartoon on the Bitcoin subreddit reads, “Licensing is when the government takes away your right to do something, and then sells it back to you.”\n\nThis political maneuvering means that the Coinbase Exchange is only available to about 2.5% of the world's population, or 24 states in the U.S. Even if the exchange were to magically become accessible to all interested customers, do you really want to do business with a company that serves politicians before consumers?\n\nIt's – Thankfully – Still Your Choice\n\nEven after reading all the damning evidence, you may still decide that you'd like to continue to do business with Coinbase. Great. That's your choice.\n\nDo be wary, however, of the pattern that is forming through their actions. Whereas now you still have the choice to use an unlicensed online exchange, do you have the option to use an unlicensed bank?\n\nNo, you don't, because banking was completely taken over by the regulatory state a long time ago.\n\nPlayers like Coinbase would see cryptocurrency go the same way."", 'Indiana’s first Bitcoin ATM, which recently debuted at an Irvington e-cigarette emporium called World of Vapor, is either a glimpse of Indiana’s cyber-money future or an anachronism. Or perhaps both.\n\n\n\nThe smallish device, positioned at the back of the store, has more in common with a vending machine than a true bank machine. Instead of performing myriad monetary transactions, it merely dispenses a product. Pump in U.S. dollars and (instead of, say, a candy bar) you get something called Bitcoin, a borderless, non-governmental digital currency that’s as liquid as mercury and as anonymous as a Swiss bank account.\n\n\n\nThe ATM accomplishes this paper-free procedure by asking for your “electronic wallet”—basically the phone app that allows you to handle bitcoins. After it scans the appropriate information from your phone, it performs the transaction and sends you a confirmation notice. If you’re paranoid about it, you also can leave the machine your email address, to which a confirmation can be dispatched.\n\n\n\nThe currency—which does not have the backing of any central bank or government—debuted in 2009 and has slowly gained a footing with everyone from criminals to legitimate businesses to investors. To its fans, the appearance of an ATM is just one more sign of its wider public acceptance. To its detractors, the fact that an entire city can be serviced by one such device is a sign of just how fringy it remains.\n\nMitchell Mitchell\n\nThe ATM’s owner, accountant Kieron Mitchell, was one of the currency’s earliest early adopters. Hoping to teach his daughter about money management, several years ago he gave her $100 to invest however she saw fit. After much research they (but mostly he) elected to buy bitcoins, which at the time were trading for a relatively paltry $5 each. Mitchell bought 20 for his daughter and a small pile for himself.\n\n\n\nIt was the financial equivalent of strapping into a roller coaster. Over the next year or so, the value of their holdings climbed to more than $1,000 per digital coin, then collapsed to about $160 before recovering to around $266 today. Mitchell realized a tidy profit by selling a portion of his pile. The experience turned him into one of the nascent currency’s leading local proponents.\n\n\n\n“As the price skyrocketed, my interest did as well,” he said.\n\n\n\nBitcoin believers\n\n\n\nToday, he’s part of a small cadre of Indianapolis-area boosters who see Bitcoin as the future of currency. He said its chief traits—that it’s anonymous, unregulated and flows easily across international borders—make it appeal to a wide range of constituencies.\n\n\n\nThose interested in buying bitcoins could do so online and avoid a trip to the ATM, though doing so would create a credit card charge—a paper trail some users would prefer to avoid.\n\n\n\nMitchell sells his ATM bitcoins for a roughly 9-percent markup over their current value. He moves about $100 a day, but he usually doesn’t know what they’re used for. Which is sort of the point. The single client who actually volunteered information said he was a small-businessman who needed them to pay a ransom. A virus had encrypted his computer files, and he had to fork over two bitcoins to the perp to get his data back.\n\n\n\nMitchell guestimates that maybe 30 percent of Bitcoin traffic comes from budding Heisenbergs engaged in shady activities. The rest is fueled by more prosaic ventures, including foreign workers sending remittances to their home countries, plus other types of money transfers, which can be accomplished with few or no fees.\n\n\n\nThere are also lots of speculators hoarding bitcoins in hopes the currency catches on in a big way. But they may have to wait a long time to realize a profit, according to Kyle Anderson, economist at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business.\n\n\n\n“I think that the adoption of a new currency is a very difficult thing,” Anderson said. “Right now, there’s potential for appreciation, but that value is basically from speculation. There’s always going to be something appealing about an anonymous digital currency, but I’m not sure that’s the path to mainstream acceptance.”\n\n\n\nAmong other things, Anderson wonders how it’s possible for retailers to price things in Bitcoin when its value can fluctuate quickly and wildly. And though some national merchants, including computer maker Dell and TV provider Dish Network, have begun accepting the currency, there still are precious few hold-in-your-hands items you can buy with it. If that doesn’t change, confidence could collapse.\n\n\n\n“Once people start having doubts about a currency, it unravels very quickly as everyone tries to get rid of it,” Anderson said.\n\n\n\nEarly adopters\n\n\n\nWhile even the store Mitchell owns that hosts his ATM doesn’t (yet) accept Bitcoin, a handful of local businesses do, including a chiropractor and a dentist. But things get tricky if you want to, say, buy lunch with your electronic money. The closest restaurant is D.T. Kirby’s Lafayette Bar, which will serve you a plate of its famous Friggin Fries for Bitcoin. But if you want a cup of java, you’ll have to visit the Groove Coffee House in Covington, Kentucky.\n\n\n\nTea drinkers have it easier. Stop by the Beautiful Taiwan Tea Co. in Zionsville and owner Paul Adamson will happily sell you a bag of Dayuling Premium High Mountain Oolong for Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nOr, rather, a small fraction of one. The value of individual bitcoins can be subdivided all the way down to the eighth decimal point. So if your tea costs, say, $20, Adamson has the necessary software to shave that relative pittance off of one of the coins in your electronic wallet.\n\n\n\nHe started offering this service not because tea drinkers clamored for it, but because, like so many Bitcoin adopters, he’s a fan.\n\n\n\n“I got into it about a year and a half ago, when Bitcoin was barely on the public radar,” Adamson said. “I got into it mainly because I thought it was really interesting.”\n\n\n\nThough walk-ins occasionally pay with the digital currency, most of the real action happens online. About 15 percent of his business is done in Bitcoin. He’s even started paying some of his suppliers with it.\n\n\n\nTrouble is, the supply of bitcoins is limited. Many are in the hands of speculators, a good portion of whom bought at a high price and are still waiting to recoup their investment. To no surprise, they aren’t interested in frittering their hoards away on tea and Friggin Fries.\n\n\n\n“Because of the price fluctuation, people are holding onto their bitcoins,” Adamson said. “They probably bought them at $300-plus, and they want to wait until they go back up before they start spending them. So the market is a bit tight.”\n\n\n\nAnother local businessman who takes the coins is Paul Overhauser of Overhauser Law Offices, which specializes in intellectual property litigation and patent and trademark protection. A Bitcoin booster, he started offering the service last spring, after clients asked about it.\n\n\n\n“It was pretty easy to start,” he said. “There are some processing providers out there that make it very easy to add a chunk of code to your website so clients can pay via Bitcoin.”\n\n\n\nSo far, perhaps 10 clients have gone this route. But Overhauser has found other uses for the currency.\n\n\n\n“One of the real benefits of Bitcoin is that the transaction fees for transferring funds are next to zero, whereas it’s not unusual to see an extra 5 or 6 percent added to payments using other methods,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe uses for the currency are growing, though slowly. A few days ago, a U.S.-based, regulated Bitcoin exchange called Coinbase Exchange opened in 23 U.S. states, including Indiana. And it’s no mom-and-pop operation. The company has raised more than $100 million in funding from backers that include the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n\n\nAt this moment (according to an iPhone app that tracks such things), there are 13.8 million bitcoins in circulation, with an individual value of around $266, and a cumulative value of $3.67 billion. A mere pittance compared to the U.S. economy, but not chicken feed, either.\n\n\n\n“We’re going to see a lot more of it as the years go by,” Overhauser predicted. “More businesses are adopting it, particularly for international transactions.”•', 'One of bitcoin\'s most important historic legacies may be the way it merges disparate fields of study to find unexpected solutions to old problems, according to one of the space\'s key thinkers.\n\nCoinDesk spoke to IBM UK\'s executive architect for innovation in banking and financial markets, Richard Gendal Brown, to get his overview of what this disruptive new technology might hold in store for the future.\n\nA far better-educated class of graduates is now emerging from universities thanks to bitcoin\'s existence, Brown said, adding:\n\n""This is a field where you truly have to be interdisciplinary to make progress.""\n\nPeople with academic backgrounds like engineering and computer science, who previously would have had little exposure to finance or economics, are now endowed with much greater awareness of how financial systems work, and what the possibilities and problems are.\n\nPeople looking at old problems in a new way, he said, ""can\'t help but lead to exciting possibilities in the future"".\n\nThere will be products and services that may not have been imagined yet, but which will come into existence thanks to these new perspectives.\n\nThinking ahead\n\nBrown\'s position gives him the enviable opportunity to spend time examining blockchain technology and extrapolating on where it might lead, both for IBM\'s own clients and the rest of us.\n\nOr as Brown himself puts it: ""Where are things going, and what does that mean for what we should do together today?""\n\nHis blog has been cited as one of cryptocurrency philosophy\'s regular must-reads. More recently, he has been a leading voice in predicting that distributed ledger technology would extend far beyond bitcoin\'s payment mechanisms and into the wider fields of contract law, smart property, aspects of decentralized trust and solving the question of identity.\n\nThe importance of miners\n\nOne particular stand-out comment in late 2014 was Brown\'s regular assertion that currency was perhaps the ""least interesting thing about bitcoin"" and its underlying technology.\n\nIt would be wrong, however, to assume this implies bitcoin as a currency is not an interesting application. Rather, Brown\'s level of interest is such that the world-changing implications of distributed ledger and consensus technologies are simply more appealing to think about.\n\nHe also not intend to diminish the importance of the currency use-case, and bitcoin\'s value, in securing the network by providing miners with something to pay for expensive equipment and electricity bills.\n\nHe said:\n\n""What I\'ve come to stress more clearly over the last couple of months is: the security of the architecture underpinning decentralized systems like bitcoin does come from the incentivization of the miners.""\n\nThen there is the fact that other distributed applications often require some form of payment mechanism to function, so it\'s handy to have one already built in.\n\nBifurcation of focus\n\nThe placing of importance on either the currency/payments application or distributed ledger technology is creating the current bifurcation of development, which we now see in startups which focus on bringing bitcoin into the mainstream consumer space on one side, and more theoretical \'crypto 2.0\' projects on the other.\n\nIn a personal capacity, Brown recently joined the advisory board of one such project, decentralized asset registry Hyperledger, joining fellow crypto-commentator Tim Swanson.\n\nCore currency use cases, to the extent they happen, will be driven by consumer applications, Brown said. ""But I don\'t see the chain of logic that concludes with major banks doing something with the currency itself.""\n\nA limited factor in the payments field is that consumers in \'developed\' economies aren\'t crying out for better solutions right now. Current systems available, despite their fees and security flaws, are still adequate for most people.\n\nMajor firms are more likely to find something compelling in distributed ledger technology, and would likely drive development in that space, he said.\n\nIdentity and reputation layer\n\nManaging online identities and reputations is one important aspect of the technology in various crypto 2.0 applications – both in interfacing with existing know your customer/anti-money laundering systems and in developing new types of apps.\n\n""I think certain use cases can\'t develop until there is some notion of identity,"" Brown said.\n\nUsing a colored coin-type platform as an example, he gives the example of a corporation that wishes to issue a blockchain-based bond. There are several identity issues that need to be resolved:\n\n""Firstly, how does anybody else in the system know that that issuer is who they say they are? If I\'m going to pay good money for a colored coin that represents $100m of a corporate bond issue, I\'d better be completely sure that it really was issued by that company or someone acting on its behalf.""\n\nIt needs to be more sophisticated than simply signing the issuing document with the company\'s SSL key, given that the person authorized to issue bonds is probably a different individual to the one who controls the key.\n\n""You can also flip that, though – you\'ve then got the obligation on the issuer to know who its lenders are. If I\'m a US corporation and I have an obligation to pay a coupon once a quarter, or whatever, I will be in big trouble if I pay that coupon to a sanctioned entity.""\n\nIt would be necessary to know who is holding the colored coins on the date of payment and, to avoid people gaming the system, the corporation would need to know who is holding the coin in the intervening periods as well, to make sure it hasn\'t just been moved to a sanctioned entity and then back again.\n\nOpportunity for entrepreneurs\n\nThere is a real opportunity for entrepreneurs to innovate in this space, Brown continued. One point where crypto 2.0 projects could add some value is finding out how to encode and describe the rules that would govern something like the aforementioned bond issuance.\n\n""There\'s a whole collection of law and thinking that needs to come together then to make this space work, and it\'s one of the reasons I find this space intellectually stimulating, because there are new problems to solve.""\n\nIn considering crypto 2.0 applications, Brown also writes of concepts like the ""continuum of decentralization"" and the ""unbundling of trust"", where the choice between centralized and decentralized is not black and white, and various centralized or trusted entities (like banks\' KYC requirements, or identities of bond issuers) can live at certain points on bitcoin\'s distributed backbone.\n\nThe sidechains concept, while only one potential solution of many, is one way that centralized entities could integrate with bitcoin technology, making it unnecessary to invent a new cryptocurrency with its own blockchain for every new application.\n\n""It now gives us a way to bridge between the attempt at decentralization that bitcoin gives you, and the need sometimes to impose more controls because the business model demands it, or the law demands it. Previously it was one or the other.""\n\nOpening minds\n\nAll this brings us back to Brown\'s unifying message: that many of these problems might not even be considered were it not for the new merging of computer science disciplines with the needs of the financial and legal worlds.\n\n""People tend of have a more open mind and are willing to think about things without the usual constraints of their day jobs.""\n\nWhether it\'s a better global payments system or something fundamentally changing organizational structures, the real \'killer app\' for the burgeoning technological field may still be some way off.\n\nIt something not even considered yet, Brown said, or ""an unexpected problem, to be solved with all manner of technologies ... It\'s an entry point for interesting conversation, if not necessarily the solution.""\n\nDoor image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Jaron Lukasiewicz wants to find the room where the rock stars hang out.\n\nThe 29-year-old CEO of US bitcoin exchange Coinsetter radiates energy as we pace the halls of Miami\'s famed Fillmore Theatre, cutting past utility rooms and navigating stairwells adorned with images of rock \'n\' roll excess.\n\nIt’s early in the first day of the North American Bitcoin Conference and Lukasiewicz has just delivered an impassioned speech, one in which he railed against the perception that bitcoin is a viable alternative to credit cards for consumers. Though not necessarily related directly to his business-to-business (B2B) exchange, he seems unusually passionate about where the industry is going wrong in this area and how it needs to refocus.\n\nFinally at rest on a beat-up backstage couch, Lukasiewicz launches into a more detailed criticism of how bitcoin has so far been positioned as a payment solution for consumers, tying his ideas to the bigger picture for his New York-based exchange.\n\nUsing his first company Ticketometer as an example, Lukasiewicz argued that just because something has perceived benefits, doesn’t mean it will gain traction in the market.\n\nLukasiewicz told CoinDesk:\n\n“At Ticketometer we thought, \'why would you ever sell tickets in a risky fashion? You should just risklessly sell tickets, and if a minimum number of tickets are sold then the event will happen\'. What you learn in doing that is it’s a logical idea, but when you do it, there are so many reasons why someone would not want to do that.”\n\nLukasiewicz suggests the bitcoin industry is at a similar moment in its history. With the initial excitement of discovery fading, he believes more entrepreneurs should start asking hard questions about consumer behavior, should the industry want to expand its reach.\n\nHe also acknowledged that this thought process was inspired by his need to believe in the industry and widen its message. The remarks echoed the sentiments of OKCoin CEO Star Xu, who also used the event as a forum for talking about how the fate of his exchange is tied to the network at large.\n\n“I’ve learned about where the opportunity is in the credit card space, and it wasn’t what I thought. It was more like, becoming the last mile,” he added.\n\nThe problem of exchange\n\nTo Lukasiewicz, the root of the problem goes back to the nature of Coinsetter’s business: exchange. While currently beneficial for merchants, he contends that consumers are overpaying when making a purchase with bitcoin.\n\n“One of the problems I figured out with the industry is that merchant defines the exchange rate,” he said, explaining how bitcoin payment processors set the price at which they will accept bitcoin for a sale before sending US dollars to a business.\n\nIt’s here, Lukasiewicz argues, that consumers are being short-changed, as bid prices represent the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay.\n\n“By using the bid, merchants are able to pass 100% of the costs onto the consumer, so they get rid of the spread. The spread is a cost that’s passed on to the consumer as well as the slippage and any other fees associated at the ‘ask’ price,” Lukasiewicz continued, adding:\n\n“If you buy something for $100, you should have $100 taken off your bank statement, that is the price.”\n\nLukasiewicz argues that bid-based pricing leads bitcoin buyers to pay more, say $102 on a $100 purchase, whereas consumers making credit card purchases are typically offered rewards.\n\nAs for changing the underlying issue, however, Lukasiewicz is less optimistic, here again suggesting that entrenched practices will erode any benefit.\n\nPayment processors, he said, could encourage merchants to offer consumers discounts, but he suggests they would face pressure from merchants who want to avoid added costs. Rather, Lukasiewicz believes the true potential of bitcoin in this industry will lie in helping credit card users to pay with their preferred brand in more places.\n\n""Allowing card payers to pay with their AmEx more places and things like that,"" he said.\n\nThe case for remittance\n\nRather than focusing on bitcoin for e-commerce, however, Lukasiewicz advocated both in the interview and his speaking slot that entrepreneurs should focus on the far more costly global remittance market.\n\n“It just fits so clearly,” he said. “You do have these challenges of teaching immigrants to buy bitcoin and hold it and send it somewhere, but it’s still been made pretty good.”\n\nThough high bitcoin ATM fees might be a continued sticking point for consumers in the developing world, Lukasiewicz believes the reduced costs provided by this infrastructure will be compelling, even despite the learning curve some users will have.\n\n“If you go [via] bitcoin to another currency, they’re not going to understand the exchange rates, but they will understand the reduced fees,” he added. “I don’t think it’s a blocker.”\n\nIn this view of the ecosystem, consumers will be able to use bitcoin ATMs and wallets as alternatives to traditional banks. Lukasiewicz added that Coinsetter is seeking to develop business connections in this space, serving as a source of liquidity for ATM providers, such as BitAccess and Robocoin.\n\n“For us, it would be creating connectors for the various ATM manufacturers,” he said.\n\n\'Win or die\' situation\n\nOverall, Lukasiewicz indicated that the bitcoin industry needs to operate more effectively and concertedly in certain areas of the financial ecosystem, and that companies need to see how they can specialize in serving a useful role toward this end.\n\n“When I talk to people starting remittance companies, they think they have a network effect,” Lukasiewicz said. “I tell them, you don’t, that doesn’t exist in bitcoin. Bitcoin is the network and that’s the only network that exists, we all win or we all die.”\n\nFor its part, Lukasiewicz said Coinsetter is still narrowly focused on serving larger market makers and on improving its liquidity, factors he framed as essential to its survival.\n\nStill, Lukasiewicz argued specialization can yield important and overlooked insights.\n\n“When you start to build an exchange and you offer it to a market, you hear what people want. When I started building our FIX API, I had no idea how important that would be, and that’s the most important thing we offer right now,” he explained.\n\nYet another part of the equation, Lukasiewicz suggested, is that a business can’t be the best at everything. In particular, he cited his company’s front-end user interface as a potential turn off to more retail clients – a factor he intends to put right this year.\n\nUltimately, though, he is confident that this philosophy has prepared Coinsetter well for what appears to be a coming uptick in US bitcoin exchanges serving the market.\n\n“I think what we built and have a chance to build, other people don’t anytime soon,"" Lukasiewicz concluded.\n\nCredit card image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The giveaway had been something Reddit had originally promised to do upon raising $50 million in new venture capital funding in the fall.\n\nAt the time, I suggested that other startups should pay close attention to how Reddit structured these “notes,” particularly as a method for rewarding customer loyalty.\n\nBut now the Reddit “notes” seem to be on hold.\n\nEarlier today, Reddit fired Ryan X. Charles, who it had hired last September as its cryptocurrency engineer. The company had hinted that notes would be at least partially based on cryptocurrency technologies, so I asked Charles what his departure meant for the program. His reply:\n\nNotes over and not going to happen at all due to the legal difficulties and disinterestedness in bitcoin of the new execs… I don’t think they understood the legal difficulty in December. Until recently, they had not seriously thought about the project at all.\n\nI have reached out to Reddit co-founder and executive chairman Alexis Ohanian for comment, and will update this post if I hear back.\n\nUPDATE: Ohanian has responded, by saying the following: “We will be issuing redditnotes; our research leads us to want to wait until the law and technology around cryptocurrency are further along before deciding exactly how. We want to make sure we can give the community the full value of the equity when they receive it in the future, and today we haven’t been able to find a way to do that within existing regulations.”\n\nSign up for Term Sheet, Fortune’s newsletter on venture capital and private equity.', ""Google has added Coinbase support to their Google Now app, enabling Android users to receive updates about Bitcoin price fluctuations and other information about their Coinbase accounts in a card via their phone.\n\nGoogle launched the service update on January 30, enabling a total of 40 third-party apps to generate cards in Google Now. Android customers who install both the Coinbase and Google Now apps can enable the new card function.\n\nCoinbase announced the partnership with Google on their blog, saying:\n\n“Beginning next week, some users of the Google app on Android will be able to receive Now cards from Coinbase. These notifications […] will provide you with timely updates, like bitcoin price changes, the delivery of bitcoin to your Coinbase wallet, and other transaction information. The functionality will be rolling out to all Android users over the next few weeks.”\n\nOther notable third-party apps that will integrate with Google Now include Airbnb, Pandora, Lyft, Ebay, The Guardian, and Waze. The cards will provide information specific to each service, such as offering places to stay through Airbnb, making music suggestions through Pandora, and keeping users up to date with the news through The Guardian.\n\nLast summer, Google Finance added a Bitcoin price ticker to their financial page. With this latest feature, some users on Reddit express excitement to see Google add another Bitcoin-related service. Others fear that new users to the digital currency will think they “have to” use Coinbase, and that the company is further strengthening its image as the “new bank.”\n\nThe Verge called Google Now “a one-stop digital assistant” that conveniently “has a view into all of the things you're doing and are interested in.” But they also pointed out that this new move gives Google more access to your personal information:\n\n“Using Google Now previously just meant that Google had a better view into all the info across all of its services, but now it's analyzing your third-party info, as well.”\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Additionally, it seems as though they aren’t paying out to those that held contracts on their site who can no longer access the web page.\n\nWhen visiting their page, users are greeted with a 403 Forbidden error. There is no message stating there are problems. There is no notification to users with active mining contracts. There is only a message without any consolation.\n\nChabat Mining hasn’t been paying out for an extended period according to concerned users on LitecoinTalk. The first report is on January 13, 2015 and reads as follows:\n\n“Is Chabat Mining now gone? No payments for several days. The forum has been closed to all postings. The three emails I have sent the past three days are unanswered.”\n\nLTCGear Also Acting Funky Alongside Chabat Mining\n\nThe first concerned poster also mentioned a possible tie-in the LTCGear, along with the site’s issues as of late.\n\n“Anybody know what is going on? Were they possibly using LTCGear shares and since LTCGear is not paying out right now, Chabat cannot pay?”\n\nLTCGear supposedly went dark as well on Jan. 20, and the website is still spotty to this day. There seems to be no clear consensus as to whether LTCGear is paying out what they promised. When trying to access the site, CCN was met with this error page.\n\nAccording to others on the BitcoinTalk forum page, they too are experiencing the same problem with LTCGear. Complaints pour in of the site being offline so much that some users are sick of the updates.\n\nWhen trying to access the Chabat Mining BitcoinTalk page to find the general sentiment, it seems it has either been deleted or set only to allow access to certain people for some time.\n\nIt does seem as Chabat Mining has run off with user’s money, which is an unfortunate side effect of a traceable, yet anonymous, cryptocurrency.\n\nSome users aren’t giving up that easy in the face of a possible scam though. According to one user on a Chabat Mining LitecoinTalk forum, someone may have a direct connection to the possibly crooked cloudmining service. Along with their connection, it seems like the user has a large amount of stake in the game.\n\n“Hey guys, I had quite a lot of money in there and paid a part of it via PayPal, so I have the guy’s data. Due to the nature of the service I can’t open a claim against him, but if there [are] more people that paid with PayPal please report it so they can help. It hasn’t paid for any days, support doesn’t answer and forum is closed to replies.”\n\nWith no response from support and no way of contact otherwise, it seems as though this anonymous user might hold one of the only ways to find out what happened. Until then, Chabat Mining seemed to have their customer’s cash and decided to leave while they could.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '«Troppi rischi». Bankitalia si allinea alla posizione dell’Eba, la vigilanza europea, e boccia il Bitcoin: la moneta virtuale, al momento, va maneggiata con cautela. La posizione di Via Nazionale non è una novità: già lo scorso luglio aveva espresso dubbi sul cyber-conio. Nel bollettino di gennaio, però, arriva un altolà secco: «Gli intermediari vanno invitati a valutare con attenzione i rischi e a considerare che in assenza di adeguati presidi e di un quadro legale certo circa la natura giuridica delle valute virtuali, quei rischi possono esporre a perdite e inficiare, di conseguenza, la consistenza del patrimonio di vigilanza e la stabilità stessa degli intermediari», scrivono gli uomini del governatore Visco, evidenziando che«le concrete modalità di funzionamento degli schemi di valuta virtuale possono integrare, nell’ordinamento nazionale, la violazione di disposizioni normative, penalmente sanzionate».\n\n“Una posizione obbligata”\n\nMa la linea dura di Bankitalia non scoraggia le associazioni che spingono la moneta elettronica. «Si tratta di una posizione obbligata», ragiona il presidente di CashlessWay Geronimo Emili, auspicando quindi che «il dibattito da organi di vigilanza e legislatore aumenti al fine di identificare quelle regole in grado di rendere il Bitcoin affidabile e sicuro per il mercato».\n\nLa svolta di Coinbase\n\nNonostante i paletti delle autorità, il cyber-conio continua a fare passi avanti. In settimana ha aperto il primo exchange americano licenzia per lo scambio di Bitcoin. A gestire il servizio sarà Coinbase, startup che ha ottenuto finanziamenti per 106 milioni di dollari da un gruppo di investitori, che include banche, società di venture capital e il New York Stock Exchange.', 'Bitmain recently introduced the Antminer S5 with their next generation chip. The S5 has the familiar open blade design as the S1 with panels on the sides to direct airflow without being completely encapsulated as the S3. What makes the S5 shine are the new chips. The S5 consumes 560 watts in our tests and runs at 1.1 to 1.2 th/s.\n\nSpecifications Antminer S5:\n\nHash Rate: 1155 GH/s ±5%\n\nHash Rate: 1155 GH/s ±5% Power Consumption: 560 to 590 W\n\nPower Efficiency: 0.51 J/GH\n\nChips 60x Bitmain BM1384 Gen3\n\nRated Voltage: 12V\n\nDimensions: 298 mm x 137 mm x 155 mm\n\nCooling: 1x 12038 fan\n\nOperating Conditions: 0 °C to 35 °C\n\nNetwork Connection: Ethernet\n\nAlso Read: Bitmain Antminer S4 Review: 2 th/s Bitcoin ASIC Miner\n\nReview of Antminer S5\n\nThe shipping gods were benevolent this time and Bitmain sent them prepared in case they were not. S5 arrived very well packaged in a rigid bubble wrap casing. This new packaging protects the Antminer from damage it can take in transit. The first thing we noticed was how light the S5 is at just 6.5 lbs. This light weight is due to the use of plastic side panels directing the airflow on the outside as opposed to the full metal casing the S3 had. While they feel a bit flimsy the tight fit and well-placed screw’s keep them secure. The top and bottom are open with simple access to the top for the four PCIe power connections. The S5 is noisy due the single 120mm fan that drives the air over the blades not being the best. The Antminer S5 runs at 61 to 65 dB at 4 feet. While not an immediate divorce maker, they are not quiet enough to put in your living room.\n\nLow Power Consumption, Solid Hashrate\n\nFor this review, we used a Dell 1200 watt server PSU with a custom breakout controller board being made in conjunction of HolyBitcoin and J4bberwock. (We will have a full review of server PSUs and breakout boards for them in the coming weeks.) We also tested with an EVGA 1300 watt Supernova. The S5 pulled 560 watts at 110v from both PSUs. For this test, we used BTCGuild and Antpool where the S5 consistently ran at 1.186 th/s. This aggressive chip brings Bitmain up to the top with the Spondoolies-Tech SP20 even slightly better. The move is a good one as falling BTC value has made each gh/s you can squeeze out of a chip at the lowest power usage a win.\n\nThe Antminer S5 uses DHCP to get on your network taking away some of the hassle of out of the box static IP addresses that may not be the same as your routers DNS setting. The control panel is the simple to use as always with the initial user name and password root / root. The password should be changed immediately. The pool config panel can quickly be populated as ever making the total setup to mining time short.\n\nOne criticism is the lack of the extra nonce feature many of Bitmain’s competitors have allowed for more coins and pool types to be used. The S5 work well on P2Pool from the start with none of the hiccups the S4 had. Bitmain’s Antpool can be used in P2Pool mode as all showing their promised commitment to keeping the global hash rate distributed. With Antpool being the second largest pool, it would be nice to see them follow through and move all of their power to P2Pool. As of now the choice is manual between “solo mining” and P2Pool on their pool.\n\nThe Antminer S5 is an excellent next step and with power consumption levels low. The S6, when it comes out with multiple blades and a rack mount chassis, should be a beast if they go that route like they have in the past with their S2 and S4. Yoshi the US Bitmain Sales representative told CCN at TNABC in Miami that the S6 may also be their next Gen chip though so time will tell which way they go.\n\nThe S5’s loud fan may turn off some buyers, but we replaced it with a Cooler Master jet flow that had a higher CFM and much lower volume at 48 dB. The change in fans also resulted in a drop in temps by 4C. Being winter and the temps below freezing in the CCN mining laboratory, we pushed the clock speed freq up and were able to get the S5 to a stable 1.41 th/s at 630 watts. Any higher the error rate would push from 1-3% to 6-8%.\n\nThe Antminer S5 also is a solid under clocking system able to drop just below 480 ways and still perform at nearly 1 th/s. This power saving feature is critical when BTC value dips are allowing you to still mine under clocked to save power costs yet at not so much of a hit performance wide to cost you too many satoshi’s.\n\nOverall another excellent chip and miner from Bitmain. How long they can keep the crown of the fastest power to gh/s ranking will be tested soon as Spondoolies and BitFury are both due out with those next gen chips very soon. The Antminer is also priced aggressively as well making it a good purchase.\n\nAt TNABC in Miami CCN asked Yoshi a few questions about Bitmain and Hashnest as well as his take on Cloud Mining with the BTC value that had taken at dive at this point. When asked about Cloud Mining he was very clear that most miners have an EOL and if they are accelerated by lower BTC value they turn them off. He noted they also have rolled out the S4 in HashNest as a choice that would allow customers to run longer. Now that the BTC value is rising many of the current miners will remain profitable longer as well.\n\nWe also asked about extra-nonces support as many customers needed it to have the S5 run on multi pools like WestHash. At the time, Yoshi the S5 would be able to do them but they had not released the new firmware. Bitmain has now released the new firmware found here, and the miners are running great with this new ability. Hytekk has put up a guide on how to install the firmware and activate the extra nonce capability.\n\nThank you, Yoshi for the information and Hytekk for the handy guide for those who had not updated the firmware before or enabled the extra nonce feature. We will be doing a longer interview with Yoshi in the near future. Stay tuned.\n\nDisclosure: Antminer S5 was purchased by the writer for review.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
