08/01/2016,"['The combination of weak near term technicals, a dip in hash rate, questions over a secretive miner/Core dev meeting, and sustained interest in ETH/ETC has pushed Bitcoin’s exchange rate down more than $20 over the weekend.\n\nWhile the drama continues to run high in the Ethereum universe, Bitcoin has its own little bit of drama going on for the time being. First of all, with Segregated Witness rolling out to production in the next Core release and rumors of miner dissatisfaction over the past month, a group of seven large miners and over a dozen Core devs attended a closed-door meeting this weekend. Although details are sparse, speculation is that on-chain scalability is the topic du jour. Also adding pressure is the fact that we have seen a noticeable drop in the hash rate over the past few weeks now that the block reward has been cut in half. Below is a 2-month chart of the Bitcoin hash rate difficulty.\n\nThis drop has traders on edge about a potentially self-reinforcing cycle of lower prices and a lower hash rate, and while we cannot entirely dismiss this as a possibility we think that in the context of the longer term chart it is not something to worry too much right now (although it is certainly worth keeping an eye on). Take a look at the 9-month hash rate chart below. It looks like a minor pullback in a strong uptrend to us.\n\nAs we move on to the exchange markets we don’t find much reassurance here either. On the 3-day chart below we can see that the breakdown out of the pennant consolidation is now real and the price is making a run for support. Despite a pennant being a traditionally bullish formation, this failure does not come as much surprise given the momentum and volume have been unconvincing for weeks. Speaking of momentum, Willy and RSI are testing their centerlines while MACD accelerates to the downside. Conversely, the 200-period SMA has finally turned up signaling that despite the recent breakdown Bitcoin remains in a bull market consolidation.\n\nOne of the other features of note on the chart below is the volume profile setup which is still not great. There is a lot of work to be done all the way down to the $466 breakout point from back in May. However, the A/D line is fairly steady indicating that perhaps there are still buyers emerging above $600. Having said that, the longer term trendline and OTE long zone both sit around $500 and there is a relatively strong support area around the $550 low which we saw earlier this summer.\n\nWhile it appears as though the market will remain weak over the short term until a new local low is carved out in the coming days, we are staying neutral with a longer term bullish bias. This means that the range trading strategy we have been mentioning for the past few weeks may be more difficult to implement in the current conditions, however, buying the dips remains a legitimate plan for those with a lower time preference. We think that in a year the $500 – 600 range will look great from an investment perspective.\n\nDisclaimer: Please always do your own due diligence, and consult your financial advisor.

Signed by some of the biggest publishers in the world, the letter described what they perceived as the browser’s ""blatantly illegal"" blocking of their ad revenue.\n\nSince then, the company’s founder has been engaging with those media outlets one-on-one in an effort to explain that Brave isn’t meant just to prevent Internet users from having their data mined, but to give media organizations a way to recover revenue from those who are already blocking ads.\n\nIn conversation with CoinDesk, Brave Software founder and CEO Brendan Eich said he intends to use the money to double the company\'s employees from 10 to 20 people and continue to help bridge the gap between content creators and users.\n\nEich said:\xad\xad\xad\n\n""We want win-win for users and publishers. We put users first, but we want publishers to earn a better share than what they receive with traditional ad blocking.""\n\nParticipating in the round are Founders Fund\'s FF Angel, Propel Venture Partners, Pantera Capital, Foundation Capital, and Digital Currency Group.\n\nWith a total of $7m now raised, the San Francisco-based firm plans to invest the money in adding new features to the platform and hiring additional staff with a special focus on quality assurance as part of its growth strategy.\n\nThe value proposition\n\nDan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, which invested $1m in this most recent round, told CoinDesk it is exactly this ability to navigate the space between content creators and consumers that first ""resonated"" with his firm.\n\nMorehead points to a history of seemingly dominant browsers including Netscape and Internet Explorer being disrupted by innovative new services as evidence of the place he sees Brave filling in the market today.\n\nIn Brave’s case, that innovation is a business model that empowers users by protecting their identity and gives media companies a way to generate the revenue.\n\n""Right now you have the two extremes. The annoying ad and subscription models and the annoying ad blocking,"" said Morehead, adding:\n\n""Brave is this middle ground between the crazy ad system we currently have and where all ads are blocked and no content is produced.""\n\nBitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin\n\nBrave is currently partnering with wallet providers BitGo and Coinbase to provide bitcoin wallets and purchasing tools and Eich says he hopes to partner in the future with wallet provider Blockchain.info.\n\nBut he added that while support for diverse wallets is a high priority, Brave has no plans to add support for ethereum or its new cryptocurrency cousin, Ethereum Classic.\n\n""We’re just sticking with bitcoin because we need something frictionless under the hood,"" he said.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""We’re still excited about using bitcoin.""\n\nGoing forward, Eich says one of the company’s top priorities will be to design identity-protection services that do a better job of preventing identifiable information from ""leaking through"" where marketers can access it.\n\nBrave is currently available for download for iOS and Android mobile devices and several desktop platforms. The version currently available is a developer version, with a 1.0 release scheduled for September 2016.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Brave.\n\nAdvertising image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In a post on the company’s official blog, Blockstream President Adam Back noted, “GreenAddress has a demonstrated track record of delivering an industry-leading product that prioritizes security, privacy and convenience.”\n\nGreenAddress has been quick to implement new Bitcoin features, such as fee estimation and replace-by-fee, into its own wallet. Also, GreenAddress developer Lawrence Nahum is a supporter of the Bitcoin Core scalability roadmap and says he’s excited about the improvements that are coming to Bitcoin in the near future.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Nahum to get the details on what GreenAddress will be working on now that it is under the Blockstream umbrella of Bitcoin products and services.\n\nImplementing CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY\n\nNahum was quick to bring up the upcoming implementation of OP_CHECKSEQUENCYVERIFY (CSV) to improve the refund process on their 2-of-2 multisignature addresses.\n\nOne of the key features of GreenAddress is the ability to complete what are essentially instant Bitcoin transactions. This works by putting user funds in a 2-of-2 multisig address where the two parties are the user and GreenAddress. If someone trusts GreenAddress to not double spend a transaction, then he or she can trust this user’s GreenAddress wallet to do the same.\n\nA refund transaction is also pre-signed and held by the user to prevent funds being locked up in an address that requires a signature from GreenAddress to send a transaction. Currently, a pre-signed nLocktime refund transaction is emailed to the user when a transaction is received on a 2-of-2 address (including change transactions). This transaction becomes valid after a predetermined amount of time.\n\nWith CSV, the refund process can be handled directly on the blockchain. The gist of it is that a 2-of-2 multisignature address will be controlled only by the user after a certain amount of time has passed.\n\nCSV also will get rid of a window of trust that is involved with the current nLocktime process. This window of trust involves the problem of an nLocktime transaction ID not being set in stone until it is confirmed on the blockchain; this issue is known as transaction malleability.\n\nNahum noted that he wants to wait until MAST (Merkalized Abstract Syntax Tree) is available before implementing CSV due to reasons related to user privacy.\n\n“Once MAST is into play, you only see the 2-of-2,” he explained. “You don't see the [refund transaction] unless it is used, which means you only reveal the nLocktime when you do recovery with MAST.”\n\nIn other words, MAST would enable the same level of privacy for these addresses as they enjoy today with the added benefit of CSV.\n\nBuilding a Bitcoin and Sidechains Wallet Library\n\nIn addition to working on its own wallet, the GreenAddress team will also be working on a library that any developer will be able to use.\n\n“The library will help us deliver better and consistently to all platforms without rewriting a lot of code for each platform,” said Nahum.\n\nThe library is in C but it will have bindings to other major languages such as Java and Python. Other C libraries, such as libsecp256k1, will also be reused in this new library from the GreenAddress team.\n\n“With the library, we do not want to reinvent the wheel,” added Nahum. “But we do want C to support all platforms, so we are reusing where applicable.”\n\nNahum explained that C was chosen as the language for the library because it can work everywhere and it’s also easy to interface with other popular languages. As an example provided by Nahum, bitcoinj can be used on iOS with some frameworks, but running it on a hardware wallet would be difficult.\n\nAccording to Nahum, support for various features enabled in Blockstream’s Elements Alpha sidechain also will be supported in the library.\n\n“So far, we have support for some of the features of Elements Alpha and we want to complete support, plus add support for features that will be released in the future (at least the ones that are applicable to the wallet),” said Nahum. “We already added support for Confidential Transactions in GreenAddress before Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong as we were experimenting with the tech.”\n\n“But our support was very proof-of-concept,” he said. “A lot more work is needed to make our support more robust.”\n\n“Our goal with the library is to make it easier for us and other developers to build powerful, secure, and fast multi-platform wallets for Bitcoin that support sidechains. I think this is good for the library as it makes it more modular and it allows people to innovate more. It will also be a way to get an early peek at features that could eventually come to Bitcoin.”\n\nNahum would like the C library to work with Bitcoin mainnet, the testnet and sidechains.\n\nThe Long-Term Vision for GreenAddress\n\nLong term, the plan for GreenAddress is to provide its users with a user-friendly, convenient wallet while also learning as little about them as possible.\n\n“Our ideal place is where we don't know which transactions are involved, yet we can validate the things users wants us to validate such as two-factor authentication or spending limits,” explained Nahum. “The less data we have the better.”\n\nNahum also shared his excitement for new improvements, such as Schnorr signatures, that should be added to Bitcoin in the near future.\n\n“Schnorr is going to be great,” he said. “Finally, multi-signature and single-signature transactions will cost the same in fees and will look the same from outside. Plus, the transaction will be smaller.\n\n“With some of these improvements, we can not only improve privacy and security but also ease-of-use, as there will be less for users to keep track of (i.e. no nLocktime files) while having better privacy and atomic security,” Nahum concluded.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin Core wallet still has better privacy features, GreenAddress offers unique protection against malware via two-factor authentication. GreenBits, another wallet from the GreenAddress team, also allows users to avoid trusting a third party by allowing them to connect to their own full nodes."", 'Brazilian bitcoin exchange Foxbit has acquired payment processor BitInvest in an acquisition worth less than $1m.\n\nWith the sale, the exchange said it is seeking to acquire new users and reinforce its position in Brazil’s nascent bitcoin market.\n\nFoxbit said BitInvest founder Flavio Pripas, the former founder of the social network Fashion.me, will serve on its board. All BitInvest accounts will be converted to Foxbit accounts as part of the deal.\n\nThe acquisition is notable given the early traction seen by BitInvest, which inked a deal in 2014 with Tecnisa, a domestic real estate firm that was Latin America\'s largest merchant to accept bitcoin at the time.\n\nStill, Foxbit chief blockchain officer João Paulo Oliveira said he expects additional acquisitions as the Brazilian market matures.\n\nOliveira said:\n\n""We are in an interesting position, as the bitcoin ecosystem grows, exchanges that are not growing will be less competitive. It is a matter of process.""\n\nAccording to data from Bitvalor, Foxbit sees about 310 BTC (or $189,000) in bitcoins trade daily on its exchange, a figure that accounts for roughly 55% of the market.\n\nOliveira said Foxbit aims to continue its momentum from the acquisition by launching a debit card for users and a consumer wallet later this year.\n\nFoxbit said no additional employees will join the startup as part of the deal.\n\nImage via Foxbit\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Reflecting on the concept of open network introduced by the OCC in its white paper, it is only logical to offer an open regulatory environment for fintech startups that are focused on bringing innovative and disruptive financial services to the country.\n\nThe OCC, an independent bureau within the Treasury Department, holds the ability to regulate and supervise all national banks and the federal branches of foreign banks in the United States. Thus, the OCC is one of the few government organizations that possesses authority over independent states and their regulations on money transmission.\n\nIf the OCC is as committed to innovation and development of open network technology as it says in its white paper, it should maximize its resources to lead each state in creating a viable ecosystem for fintech companies to operate in, similar to the regulatory environment of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe U.K. and its regulatory bodies have persistently opted for favorable policies for fintech and digital currency startups since early 2015, after realizing the market for and importance of fintech to the economy of the nation.\n\nIts government took an alternative approach, establishing different regulations for businesses in the fintech industry in order to enable the fintech sector to operate and prosper.\n\n“Our interviews suggested the U.K. government should consider additional actions to support the Fintech community, particularly in the areas of improving access to talent; encouraging closer collaboration and information sharing between established financial services businesses and Emergent Fintech; and actively championing the sector,” states an official report commissioned by U.K. Trade and Investment.\n\nApart from local regulatory policies, the U.K. government and its agencies including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) went as far as securing partnerships with other global organizations in South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong to improve its fintech market and position itself as the leading nation in financial technologies.\n\nSingapore and South Korea, for instance, have partnered with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority to create a bridge between Singaporean and South Korean fintech startups with the British. The partnership established a friendly ecosystem for fintech startups to discuss emerging technologies and the latest trends in the market. With this program, and favorable regulations from the federal government, Singapore and South Korea have quickly escalated as the leaders of the Asian fintech and blockchain industries.\n\nFurthermore, European countries such as Switzerland and Germany also have begun to develop friendly regulations for fintech startups, recognizing their significant impact to their economies. As a result, German fintech companies received more venture capital funding than startups in London and the United States, securing more than $1.6 billion in investment.\n\nThe Swiss Federal Tax Administration’s announcement in mid-2015 that it was eliminating value-added tax (VAT) for Bitcoin spurred interest among investors and venture capital firms, enabling fintech startups to secure large sums of funding from local investors.\n\nConsidering the potential of fintech and its rapid growth in the American and global markets, the United States and the OCC should follow the lead of countries such as the U.K. and encourage the government to establish regulatory policies that won’t leave the fintech industry lagging behind their global competitors.', 'by\n\nSubscribe to our RSS feed to get the latest realty news.

Real estate crowdfunding website Brelion is launching a pilot property, making it the only company offering a Bitcoin digital currency real estate investment option.\n\nThe property is a suburban, four-bedroom 1.5 bath residence and was bought for approximately 30.83 XBT. The renovations are expected to cost an estimated 65.49 XBT after which the project manager expects the property to appraise for approximately 120.21 XBT at the project’s close and be refinanced to return the equity invested in the home.\n\nBrelion is interested in breaking down the barriers to real estate investment by taking it out of the hands of big funds and banks and giant corporations, making it more accessible. By utilizing the crowdfunding concept made popular by sites such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter, Brelion can provide individual accredited investors’ access to alternative investment options, giving them the ability to hand select projects while enabling small and mid-size renovation companies to access capital without being beholden to traditional financing.\n\nBitcoin is outside the control of any government, bank or individual, preventing such entities from being able to manipulate its value. It is a true global currency that has the potential to become a standard international currency, simplifying the way we buy and sell. It’s still very much in the early stages of consumer adoption and options for investors using Bitcoin are limited but growing. Brelion is joining the group of companies internationally that accept this currency.\n\nBrelion founder, Vadim Kleyner was an early adopter of Bitcoin currency and believes that opening Brelion to investments in the form of Bitcoin supports his mission to make investing more accessible through the use of technology. He said “At Brelion, we believe investing should be simple and profitable for everyone involved. I believe this currency has major potential and there are not yet enough options for people that use it to be able to invest it and gain returns rather than having their money sit in a virtual wallet. So I decided to open our projects to Bitcoin investment, starting with our pilot property.”\n\nKleyner is certainly not a newcomer to alternative investing, real estate or IT and has more than 20 years of IT experience with a decade of real estate experience. As CTO of Costupdate, he spearheaded the deployment of a “just-in-time” B2C logistics platform, synthesising the most efficient delivery paths for 1 million products from a multitude of sources around the world. In 2015, he sold his $100 million asset under management (AUM) real estate company to a partner of Keller Williams Realty.', 'The question of whether or not bitcoin is really money has gained attention in light of recnt events in the bitcoin world. Even the Torah, the traditional Jewish law, has weighed in on what defines currency, according to a recent post in Chabad.org, a website dedicated to empowering Jews worldwide with knowledge of their 3,300-year-old tradition.\n\nDoes Judaism consider bitcoins to be money? The question was addressed in an article under that very heading by Rabbi Yehuda Shurpin, who responds to questions posed to the website.\n\nMonetary Value Is What Counts\n\nAs long as something has monetary value, it does not make a difference in Jewish law whether it is actual “currency” or not in most instances, Shurpin noted.\n\nThe question of how to define currency is addressed in the context of a law governing lending money and merchandise.\n\nAccording to Jewish law, a Jew cannot lend money with interest to another Jew, Shurpin noted. The law applies not only to money, but to merchandise. One is allowed to borrow, but in some cases, even borrowing was forbidden because the value of the merchandise can increase by the time it is repaid.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin isn’t money, Florida judge rules in laundering case\n\nRule On Loaning Merchandise\n\nLoans of merchandise have to be based on the value of the merchandise at the time it is borrowed. When returning the merchandise, it must be returned in an amount equivalent to its value when it was borrowed.\n\nThere are three exceptions to the rule on borrowing and returning merchandise in equivalent amounts.\n\n1) When borrowing a small amount, it can be returned in an equivalent amount since any change in the price will be insignificant.\n\n2) When the borrower has a small amount of what he is borrowing, he can borrow more of that merchandise.\n\n3) If the merchandise carries a fixed market price and is easily available, one can borrow and return an equivalent item.\n\nAs for currency, one can borrow and return the same amount.\n\nWhat Is Currency?\n\nCurrency in Jewish law is defined as something having been decreed as legal tender by the sovereign government and accepted as the currency in the given locale.\n\nBased on this definition, bitcoin is not currency, Shurpin noted. Instead, it is considered a commodity, like most foreign currency. Hence, if you borrow bitcoins, you have to return them in the same value you borrowed them at.\n\nBecause usury laws are complex, the sages warn the prohibition against usury is more serious than that of other monetary prohibitions. The law notes that in the merit of being meticulous, Jews will merit entrance to the Promised Land.\n\nThe question has gained a lot of interest in the bitcoin community recently since a Florida judge dismissed charges against a man accused of violating an anti-money laundering law when he tried to launder bitcoin to an undercover detective. The judge ruled that the cryptocurrency was not “tangible wealth” and not considered money since it wasn’t backed by any bank or a government.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'News24 allows you to edit the display of certain components based on a location.

The final July figure, released on Monday morning, confirmed a reading of 52. That was substantially down from June\'s final reading of 52.8, taken prior to the EU referendum.\n\nThe purchasing managers index (PMI) figures from Markit are given as a number between 0 and 100.\n\nAnything above 50 signals growth, while anything below means a contraction in activity — so the higher the better.\n\nWithin Europe, it was something of a mixed picture, with France and Greece both recording contractions in the month, while Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands were the best performers, Markit\'s data showed.\n\nHere are the breakout readings provided by Markit:\n\nSpain manufacturing — 51, previous 52.2\n\nItaly manufacturing — 51.2, previous 53.5\n\nFrance manufacturing — 48.6, previous 48.6\n\nGermany manufacturing — 53.8, previous 53.7\n\nGreece manufacturing — 48.7, previous 50.4\n\nAnd here\'s the single currency area-wide chart:\n\nSpeaking about the results, Markit\'s chief economist Chris Williamson said:\n\n""Although signalling an easing in the pace of expansion in July, the PMI points to steady manufacturing growth. The problem is that growth is looking increasingly lop-sided, which will worry policymakers and add to calls for further stimulus from the ECB.\n\n""The surveys suggest that euro area factory output is expanding at a near-2% annual pace, which has encouraged firms to take on extra staff at the fastest rate for five years in recent months. Deflationary pressures are also easing, with costs showing the first rise for a year and selling prices stabilising.""\n\nAt 9:30 a.m. BST (4:30 a.m. ET) Markit will release the first set of confirmed UK manufacturing data since the vote to leave the European Union, which could confirm the disastrous flash PMI\'s released in mid-July.', 'There seems to be an endless list of bitcoin wallets available for those who wish to use the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency; however, the path towards profitability for the companies behind these projects seems a bit unclear. On a recent episode of Bitcoin Uncensored, Breadwallet’s Aaron Voisine and Aaron Lasher attempted to explain the path towards profitability for a bitcoin wallet to co-hosts Chris DeRose and Joshua Unseth.\n\nFocused on Creating More Bitcoin Users\n\nWhile they aren’t able to talk for the entire bitcoin wallet industry, Voisine and Lasher made it clear that part of a bitcoin wallet’s job is to attract new users to the space, which in turn leads to more users of their wallet. “Our focus is on attracting new users and making Bitcoin more accessible and easier to use for regular people,” Voisine stated.\n\nFor Breadwallet, the focus is on Bitcoin above everything else. When asked whether Breadwallet users will eventually be able to hold fiat currency in their wallets, Lasher responded simply, “No.”\n\n“We’re focused on bitcoin. That’s the whole reason why we exist -- to help people use bitcoin,” Voisine added.\n\nHow will Breadwallet be able to bring new users to Bitcoin? “For us, the plans are to keep it as simple and clean as possible,” Voisine explained. “We want to focus really carefully on the payment experience -- keeping it fast, simple, and clean. And use that to try to attract users.”\n\nLater in the interview, Lasher added, “We do think bitcoin has the potential to be a large, dominant, and global type of currency.”\n\nBuilding a User Base\n\nWhile creating new Bitcoin users is great for the entire industry, Breadwallet also wants to focus on carving out a chunk of users for their wallet. “If Bitcoin becomes a major, global currency and we have one of, if not the most, popular bitcoin wallet in the world, then I think that’s a very valuable position to be in,” Voisine explained.\n\nAccording to Voisine, the focus is currently on developing an easy-to-use wallet that also offers the highest levels of privacy and security to its users. “We’re focused on user acquisition and growing our numbers,” Voisine responded when asked how he and Lasher expect to make money with their venture.\n\nLasher, who was an early investor in Breadwallet, explained the general philosophy behind his investment in the wallet:\n\n“If Bitcoin is successful, someone is going to win big, and I think it’s going to be a wallet. Whoever the winner is, there’s going to be a user interface; there’s going to be a way to use your bitcoin, and it’s going to have to be on your phone. That’s what attracted me to Breadwallet as I thought, ‘Okay, these guys have a pretty good chance.’”\n\nDuring the interview, Lasher shared that 33.6 percent of their users are located in North America. When asked about the future consolidation of bitcoin wallet companies, Voisine agreed that there’s a lot of competition in the space and consolidation will eventually be needed.\n\nLasher also noted that Breadwallet has developed metrics to estimate how much bitcoin is being held in Breadwallet software around the world.\n\nThen What?\n\nSo what happens once a bitcoin wallet has attained a large user base, and what’s the point of gaining that user base if there’s no clear path towards revenue?\n\nAt first, Voisine replied that Breadwallet could follow a path similar to many other tech companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, who focused on user growth and acquisition rather than revenue in their early stages of development; however, Bitcoin Uncensored co-host Joshua Unseth was quick to point out that those companies rely on collecting large amounts of data from their users, which is something Breadwallet is not willing to do.\n\nLasher attempted to explain Breadwallet’s path to profitability in a more clear, concise manner:\n\n“Brokered third-party services. The first will be buying bitcoin, and you’ll be able to buy bitcoin from within Breadwallet. The reason that you would is that the experience is going to be very easy, very smooth, [and] very fast compared to other options people have. And we’ll take a very small cut of that.”\n\n“We’re looking at a big business model change,” Lasher explained at another point in the interview. “We’re betting big on banking changing in the following way: Instead of having banks or third-parties hold your money, you’re going to have banking services, but you’re always in control of your funds.”\n\nOver the years, free software companies have been able to find unique methods of generating revenue. For example, Google once paid Mozilla $900 million to be the default search engine in Firefox over a three-year period.\n\nFrom Lasher’s perspective, Breadwallet will have a clearer road to revenue once there is a lot of money being held in their software by their users:\n\n“From a certain perspective, we’re a company that has assets under management because every single person who uses Breadwallet, from a certain perspective, we’re a bank or a hedge fund holding those funds because we’re in charge of keeping them secure. We don’t control them, but it’s our job to make sure that the people who do own these coins can keep them securely.”\n\n“Our investors understand they’re making a very risky bet, but if they win, they’re going to win big time,” Lasher stated.']"
08/02/2016,"['Bitfinex, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges online, has suffered a major hack. The company has posted a note on its website detailing the security breach, and while it doesn’t mention a total amount, one of their employees confirmed on Reddit that the total amount stolen was 119,756 bitcoins.\n\nThat amount converts to about $77,000,000 based on a price of $650 USD per bitcoin, which is about what bitcoin traded at over the course of the last week.\n\nAfter news of the hack spread, the price of bitcoin dropped almost 20 percent, settling in around the current price of $540 USD per bitcoin. It’s not exactly clear why the price dropped, but it’s likely bitcoin investors got nervous about potential hacks on other exchanges and decided to sell off their bitcoin holdings, which led to a rapid decrease in price.\n\nSo how exactly did the hack happen? It’s not really clear yet, and the exchange hasn’t released any additional information beyond saying they incurred a loss and are suspending operations, and that USD funds and other cryptocurrency balances haven’t been compromised.\n\nWe do know that Bitfinex’s platform used BitGo, a Palo Alto-based bitcoin security company that allows exchanges to provide segregated, multi-signature wallets for each customer’s funds. This is a supposed security improvement over exchanges that merge customers’ funds into large, communal wallets. This method of maintaining segregated wallets for each user on the exchange also means that users can keep tabs on their wallet balance at all times, which is how some Bitfinex users have been able to see that funds have been removed from their wallets.\n\nBitGo tweeted earlier today that they “found no evidence of a breach on any BitGo servers.”\n\nAs we directly notified our customers earlier today, our investigation has found no evidence of a breach to any BitGo servers. — BitGo (@BitGo) August 2, 2016\n\nThat doesn’t really help tell us how exactly the hack happened, as neither service has yet claimed responsibility. Plus, the question still remains why neither BitGo or Bitfinex has working limits in place to stop rapid withdrawals of large amounts of bitcoin.\n\nMany exchanges will automatically restrict the amount of bitcoin that can be withdrawn at once, so even if they are hacked losses will be capped at a smaller amount. However, Bitfinex did say on Reddit that “there were limits in place to restrict the amount of btc that could be signed for a withdraw [and they’re] still trying to investigate how these limits were bypassed.”\n\nWhile it’s too early to speculate next steps, many are wondering what the fate of their coins will be. Because of the segregated BitGo wallets, only some customer’s wallets were compromised. This means that some user’s wallets may be totally intact. The question then becomes do you let those users withdraw their funds, or pool the funds and proportionally issue refunds so every user incurs the same loss, even if their own wallets weren’t directly compromised.\n\nBitfinex has said they have alerted and are working with law enforcement, which may complicate things further if the company needs to go through a bankruptcy proceeding, like Mt.Gox did after hackers drained the exchange of all operating funds.\n\nThis comes just weeks after hackers stole $50M worth of Ethereum, which caused the currency to complete a “hard fork” so they could reverse the transactions containing stolen currency.\n\nThe lesson here is once again that the safest way to store bitcoin is in your own (preferably offline) wallet, and not on a website or exchange.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', 'Brave has announced that they are partnering with Coinbase and BitGo to provide Bitcoin wallets and purchasing tools for the Brave Ledger, a new Bitcoin-based micropayments system which automatically and anonymously pays user’s favorite websites.\n\nBrave will also allow users and publishers to opt into a better, privacy-preserving ad model which shares revenue with users as well as publishers.\n\nBrendan Eich, President and CEO of Brave Software, says:\n\n""The Brave solution fends off intrusive ads and stops the collection of personal details by third-parties, enhancing not just browsing speed, but security and privacy.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/Illustration\n\nBy Jemima Kelly\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - A company that provides banks with anti-money-laundering controls has teamed up with a bitcoin security firm to try to curb nefarious uses of the digital currency, such as drug trafficking and terrorism financing.\n\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions said the new service it has created with London-based startup Elliptic would bring bank-grade AML controls to bitcoin transactions, making the virtual currency more attractive to those who might want to use it for legitimate transactions\n\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions, part of multinational analytics firm RELX Group (REL.L), helps banks comply with AML regulation, using a database of 2.7 million global entities that could be involved in illicit transactions, such as those on sanctions and other watch-lists.\n\nIt has shared that database with Elliptic, which monitors bitcoin transactions and can alert its clients - ranging from bitcoin exchanges to U.S. and European intelligence agencies - when money moves from bitcoin addresses that have been identified as bad actors.\n\n“This is a step toward making it (bitcoin) more mainstream and more acceptable,” said Thomas Brown, of LexisNexis Risk Solutions.\n\nBitcoin is a web-based digital currency that relies on complex algorithms to move money around quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority to process transactions.\n\nThat has made it attractive to a variety of users, including those who want to get around capital controls and those who support a currency that is free from government control for ideological reasons. But it has also attracted criminals, such as drug dealers and arms traffickers.\n\n“Today, if you see bitcoins transacting, you almost assume they’re from someone who wants to be off the grid, or they’re proceeds from illicit transactions,” said Brown.\n\nLast month Elliptic said it was working with the Internet Watch Foundation to clamp down on the use of bitcoin for online child pornography.\n\n“The single biggest thing keeping mainstream financial services out of the (bitcoin) ecosystem is the inability to do bank-grade anti-money laundering controls,” said Elliptic’s head of business development, Kevin Beardsley.\n\n“The hope is that this will unlock a whole wave of companies being able to enter financial services with bitcoin.”', 'The closed-door meeting between Bitcoin Core developers and miners has affected the prices. With no information about the progress, price continues to fall. Read more...\n\nBitcoin price has been exhibiting a downward trend from the past few days. The fall in Bitcoin price is attributed to uncertainties regarding the outcome of the meeting between Bitcoin Core developer group and miners.\n\nWith the miners and developers continuing their meeting behind closed doors to discuss the future of Bitcoin, the digital currency community is left speculating about the future of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin network is in need of scaling up as the community grows. However, the lack of consensus between developers and miners has prevented much progress in this regard.\n\nAs the anticipation grows, the very fact that a section of Bitcoin community – consisting of developers and miners – meeting in private is a matter of concern. Bitcoin is an open sourced, transparent peer-to-peer ecosystem and the current developments don’t inspire much confidence in it.\n\nThere are reports of few miners resisting major changes to the Bitcoin network – like a hard fork that increases the block size – while reiterating that they would like to stick to Bitcoin Core. Many BIPs like the Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Unlimited have failed trying to improve the network due to this. Few speculations as to why some of the large miners prefer Core over other versions and their resistance to increased block size as stated by /u/Capt_Roger_Murdock are as follows:\n\n* Collusion between Core and miners to maintain the current block size for gains through higher miner fee for transactions\n\n* Misconception about increase in block size and its negative effects on decentralization\n\n* Threat from Bitcoin Core developers to release a 1 MB Proof of Work changing fork if the miners decide to act on their own, which may impact the efficiency of existing mining hardware owned by miners.\n\n* Doubts about reliability and support from any other fork due to the belief that other developers may not be competent enough or the lack of funding.\n\nWhile these are few valid points if any of these speculations are indeed true, it can be countered by a collective resistance from the community. In order to do so, it is necessary to have an open discussion with the whole community instead of just a handful of people. A well-informed mass of people allowed to decide what is best for them will help the Bitcoin ecosystem to move forward, without having to depend on a small group to decide what’s best for millions of users.\n\nIn a recent tweet, the founder of Litecoin Charlie Lee states the Bitcoin Civil War to be over. It is quite a cryptic message considering there is no concrete information available about the discussions at the meeting.\n\nIt is time the Bitcoin community gets to know about any new developments before the value of bitcoin takes a huge hit, reigniting the concerns raised during Bitcoin reward halving.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""The online drug store and medical platform United Pharmacies has officially introduced Bitcoin as its newest payment method, offering 10% discount for all drugs and products listed on its store.\n\nUnited Pharmacies is one of the few firms in the pharmaceutical industry to offer Bitcoin as one of its main forms of payment because of the strict Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations imposed on companies in the industry.\n\nIntegration of Bitcoin\n\nCustomers of the United Pharmacies platform and members of the Bitcoin community presume that United Pharmacies’ integration of Bitcoin will establish a positive precedent for other companies in the pharmaceutical industry to offer payment methods with minimal regulation and legal processes.\n\nTypically, companies such as United Pharmacies offer a limited range of payment methods to comply with the financial regulations they are required to respect. Thus, most pharmaceutical companies and independent drug stores offer traditional means of payments such as international wire transfer and international cashier's check.\n\nMerit of Digital Currencies\n\nDigital currencies like Bitcoin provide two major advantages over conventional payment methods: low transaction fees and efficiency. Payment options often recommended by online drug stores - specifically bank wiring - require users to take certain steps which often result in the customers either going to the physical branch or settling the transaction over the phone. Once the transaction is completed, bank details and transaction information have to be sent to the company, which then requires additional verification and authentication which could take anywhere from 3 to 7 days.\n\nUnited Pharmacies explains:\n\n“Setting up an International Wire Transfer can sometimes be done using your internet banking account. However many banks only provide this service over the telephone or in person at a bank branch.”\n\nBitcoin eliminates any additional processes and fees for both the customer and the company. It removes the fees usually dealt to the customer and enables the company to process the shipment faster, ultimately optimizing each operation handled by the firm."", ""In February, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Alipay, an online payment platform of the Chinese e-commerce corporation Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., had announced a project based on blockchain technology and cloud services. The announcement indicated the growing interest of Alibaba in distributed ledger technology.\n\nNow, it appears that the Chinese giant is gradually committing to the blockchain. Ant Financial, the Alibaba company that operates Alipay, is using distributed ledgers to transparently record transactions and improve the accountability of Chinese philanthropic organizations, Bloomberg Technology reports.\n\nAnt Financial dominates the online payments market in China through its Alipay service, which has more than 450 million annual active users and has been compared to PayPal. Credit Suisse estimates that that 58 percent of China’s online payment transactions go through Alipay. The company also operates a money-market fund called Yu’e Bao and an online bank called MYbank.The name Ant refers to the small merchants — myriads of hardworking ants — who sell goods through Alibaba, The Wall Street Journal explains.\n\nAnt Financial was spun off as a stand-alone company before the $25 billion Alibaba initial public offering in 2014 and is expected to launch its own IPO. The company completed a new $4.5 billion funding round in April as reported by The Financial Times, giving it a valuation of roughly $60 billion, according to China Business News, a respected daily newspaper that is part-owned by Alibaba. The new investors include high-profile state-owned Chinese corporations such as a unit of China Investment Corp. (CIC), the country’s sovereign wealth fund and a subsidiary of China Construction Bank, the country’s second-largest lender by assets.\n\n“We hope to bring more transparency to charity and blockchain technology’s decentralized nature fits that purpose well,” said Ant Financial CTO Cheng Li. “It means that all the information and transaction history of funds will be more reliable and can’t be easily tampered with.”\n\nThe China Social Assistance Foundation is one of the first large Chinese charities to join the project.\n\nCheng explained that donors on “Ant Love” — the charity platform operated by the company — will be able to track transaction histories and gain a clearer understanding of where their funds go and how they’re used. According to the Ant Financial executive, that makes it tougher to alter records and may help restore some of the trust that’s been squandered over the years. In fact, though philanthropy is growing fast in China, numerous scandals have undermined the donors’ confidence and trust.\n\nCheng added that Ant Financial is using a private blockchain for the project and plans to open up the ledger to charity organizations and auditors in the future. It seems plausible that Ant Financial has chosen philanthropy, a non-controversial and socially important application, for its first projects with distributed ledger technology before moving on to business-relevant and potentially very profitable applications such as payments and remittances.\n\nIn this case, Ant Financial — a fast-growing subsidiary of one of the world’s largest tech giants, expected to become a high-profile public corporation itself — would give a significant boost to the distributed ledgers in the mainstream business world.\n\nBitGive Foundation’s Ongoing Charity 2.0 Initiative: Donation Transparency Platform on the Bitcoin Blockchain\n\nAnt Financial is not the first to try to improve transparency in charitable giving. The BitGive Foundation, a U.S. 501(c)(3) nonprofit whose mission is to “revolutionize global philanthropy through technology,” announced BitGive’s Charity 2.0 Initiative: Donation Transparency Platform for donors and nonprofits using Bitcoin's blockchain technology in 2015.\n\n“It is interesting and exciting to see entities like Ant Financial and Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group looking at blockchain technology,” BitGive Founder and Executive Director Connie Gallippi said to Bitcoin Magazine. “Their desire to develop a charity project focused on transparency is certainly great testament to BitGive’s Charity 2.0 Initiative: Donation Transparency Platform, which we have been developing for over a year. BitGive’s platform has been widely supported by the Bitcoin and Blockchain community and has received grants and other financial support from philanthropic entities, including the Walter and Karla Goldschmidt Foundation.”\n\nAccording to the BitGive website, the new platform will revolutionize philanthropy by allowing donors and the public to trace nonprofit transactions on a public platform in real time, to track the funds until they reach their final destination and to see how the donations are spent. BitGive’s platform also has a donor-experience focus that ties donor contributions to direct results on the ground so donors will not only know how and where their donation funds were spent, they will also see the impact and results first-hand from their contributions.\n\nGallippi also noted that a key distinguishing principle for BitGive’s Donation Transparency Platform is that it is built on the public and widely-accepted Bitcoin blockchain, rather than on a private blockchain, “providing true public transparency and accountability on an immutable ledger that is housed on a distributed global infrastructure.”\n\nBitGive’s MVP (minimum viable product) will be released within the next month or so, says Gallippi, showcasing charity partners who have elected to be demonstration use cases, including those using cross-border transactions for projects in developing countries. The platform will also incorporate administrative and data analysis features for charities to use in reporting and auditing."", 'ETC, the cryptocurrency of a network called Ethereum Classic designed to continue the original chain of the Ethereum network, has overtaken two dominant digital currencies Ripple and Steem to become the third largest cryptocurrency in the market.\n\nThe market cap of Ethereum Classic which is at US$240 million at the time of writing, continued to surge over the past few days due to the overwhelming support of the Ethereum and Bitcoin communities.\n\nBitcoin core developers including Greg Maxwell cited the negative precedents the Ethereum hard fork have set for the entire digital currency industry and voiced their support for Ethereum Classic.\n\nWith the support of developers, exchanges steadily began to offer services for Ethereum Classic, launching live ETC trading for both casual and professional traders.

It allows individuals to have full control over their finances without needing to go through a bank. Many investors are starting to use bitcoin as a long term store of value and hedge against financial uncertainty.\n\nIf you're new to Bitcoin and feel overwhelmed with all the information then here are three easy steps to get you started.\n\n\n\nStep #1: Secure your Private Keys\n\nThe first thing you need to do is make sure your private keys are safe. Bitcoin is an open public ledger and key pairs give you ownership of coins on that ledger. Each pair has a public and private key that looks like this:\n\nPublic Key:\n\n1AZPShhF9DaxPvUZZkLUs5Qqif8yeem5Sx\n\nPrivate Key:\n\n\n\nL3YuUjpHzsVM4nMf1CSFuKz6Sr6NVXy8QakXeBNSe7T8ojiWeaNn\n\nYour public key is like your email address, you share it to receive coins and your private key is like a password that allows you to send coins. If you lose your private keys or if someone steals them your coins will be lost forever. This is why it's important to keep them safe.\n\nYou have two options to keep your keys safe; invest time to learn how to secure your computer properly or invest a bit of money on a hardware wall to make it easy. Trezor is an easy to use hardware wallet that will keep your keys isolated from any viruses.\n\n\n\nStep #2: Buy Coins\n\nOnce you have everything set up to keep your private keys safe you'll be able to purchase your first coins. There are different exchanges to buy coins and the most popular one is Coinbase. When opening up any account on an exchange you'll need to set up 2-Factor Authentication. In the event that a hacker steals your password they'll need to get access to your phone because it generates a secondary login code.\n\nYou can purchase coins by sending money from your bank to the exchange. If you don't want to use a bank then you can also meet up locally with someone to buy them directly with cash. Direct peer-to-peer purchases usually charge a 5-10% premium over the spot markets.\n\n\n\nStep #3: Transfer the Coins Over to your Wallet\n\nUnless you're actively trading you want to make sure that you control your own private keys. Leaving your coins on an exchange can be risky. If an exchange gets hacked or goes bankrupt you could lose money.\n\nOnce the bitcoins are in your possession you can use them for all kinds of things such as storing value, sending cheap payments, tipping, electronic cash, making purchases and trading. Bitcoin is a really efficient form of money that can be accessed 24/7 without spending limits or restrictions.\n\n3 Easy Steps to Get Started with Bitcoin was originally published on Due Payment Processing Blog by Rocky Darius."", 'A new study conducted by the University of Wisconsin in partnership with UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies and the Deutsche Bundesbank has demonstrated that the Bitcoin Economy has significantly grown and matured in the past few years.\n\nBitcoin evolves and we need to know how\n\nThe research has revealed that the number of Bitcoin transactions has increased significantly from approximately 1,000 per day in 2011 to 300,000 per day. As the network has expanded and continues to do so, the need to explore how the cryptocurrency evolves became apparent. This has largely driven the research.\n\nThe study explains:\n\n“At the current exchange rate the notional value of daily transaction volume ranges between $200 and $300 million. Thus, it becomes appropriate to explore how the Bitcoin economy is populated and extract the map of payment relationships, as well as to trace the evolution of those relationships over time”.\n\nFor that purpose, the research took a direction to identify the interconnection between the economic agents that use the Bitcoin payment network for transferring digital currencies between each other. Data from the Bitcoin Core over the period from 3rd January 2009 through to the 8th May 2015 was imported and managed via a MySQL database designed to run high-performing application codes.\n\nResearchers have gathered together publicly accessible individual addresses as the minimum units of Bitcoin identity and grouped them into particular business categories through analyzing some of their specific transaction patterns.\n\nApplying the input address heuristic, researchers have grouped 75,191,953 unique Bitcoin addresses obtained from the Internet into 30,708,660 clusters which were further filtered to link part of superclusters to real world entities (e.g. BTCChina, Kraken, Xapo, etc.) which belong to different business categories (exchange, mining pool, online gambling, black market and composite). It allowed researchers to further create a map of payment relationships between them and make conclusions regarding transaction behavior in each business category.\n\nThree Regimes in Bitcoin Economy\n\nRelying on the results of the analysis of transaction relationships, researchers measured the relative prevalence of each general business category in the sample and tracked their evolution over the study period. Thus, the study identified three distinguishable regimes that have occurred and evolved in the Bitcoin economy since its inception.\n\nPeriod 1: from January 2009 through to March 2012 - identified as a proof-of-concept period and characterized by test transactions among a small number of users with very little meaningful commercial activity. The analysis showed that this period was almost entirely dominated by mining.\n\nPeriod 2: April 2012 through to October 2013 - identified as a period of early adopters, bolstered by black market usage and gambling.\n\nIt was no surprise that these types of businesses were among the first responders to Bitcoin, as they were attracted by its unique features such as its relative anonymity (pseudonymity), lack of regulatory and legal oversight, borderless transactions, and low transaction costs absent from taxation.\n\nAs study points out, Bitcoin as the new form of secure digital cash appeared to be ideal for the purchase and sale of illicit drugs, stolen items, and other activities that could not be easily paid for elsewhere online. However, there was a concurrent drop in using Bitcoin for ‘sin’ activities in October 2013 when a number of black markets ( the largest among them was the Silk Road) were shut down.\n\nPeriod 3: November 2013 - Present - period of Bitcoin network maturation, characterized by departure of the Bitcoin economy from ‘sin’ enterprise and diversifying into legitimate payments, commerce and services.\n\nResearch indicates that the period from January 2014 to May 2015 was characterized by a significant increase in legal services with digital currency exchange services at the center of this process.\n\nWe are to witness further maturing of Bitcoin\n\nThe study showed that the Bitcoin economy has indeed matured going all the way from the mining-dominated stage to the exchange-dominated stage.\n\nThe study reports:\n\n“The result of this work is to show that the Bitcoin economy, rather than being a fleeting and frivolous pursuit, has grown and matured over the past few years that it has been operational, with distinct patterns of behavior among its most influential entities and participants.”\n\nThe paper also states that as the Bitcoin economy continues to evolve, the method of de-anonymization used in the analysis can be used further to ascribe unknown entrants of the network to new distinct business categories.\n\nThe research team also suggested that recent concerns regarding the use of Bitcoin for illegal activities at the present time might be over-exaggerated, and even if such transactions may currently still exist, there is a visible trend towards their diminishing as the Bitcoin economy is maturing.']"

Hinkes represents companies and entrepreneurs in state and federal commercial litigation matters, representation of court-appointed fiduciaries and electronic discovery issues.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Hinkes looks at the potential impact of the recent court decision in Florida that centered in part on the definitions of both bitcoin and money transmission.\n\nMichell Espinoza had a good Monday.\n\nOn that day last week, the South Florida bitcoin exchanger saw money transmission and money laundering charges against him dismissed. Espinoza was arrested in 2014 for selling bitcoins to an undercover law enforcement agent, and he has again been thrust into the spotlight due to the potential impact of the case.\n\nThe court\'s eight-page opinion, discussing the application of Florida money transmission and money laundering statutes to sales of bitcoin, was the first of its kind, and it suggested that certain notions of how the law views transactions made in bitcoin may be revisited.\n\nAll told, the Espinoza opinion may have only triggered a policy fight that will redefine Florida’s position on cryptocurrencies, as it reached a somewhat controversial conclusion when interpreting Florida’s money transmission statute.\n\nFor example, it is clear that the sale of bitcoin by a person to another person in exchange for US dollars is not a three-party transaction as required for money transmission, as the court outlined. But while it could have stopped its analysis there, concluding that the facts did not support the government’s charge, it determined that bitcoin was not ""currency, monetary value or a payment instrument"".\n\nThe surprise wasn’t only that the court addressed the issue at all, but also its conclusion.\n\nPast precedent\n\nAlthough the court did not need to reach the issue, there was ample support for it to rule either way.\n\nThe court could have relied upon in SEC v Shavers, where it was concluded that bitcoin ""is a currency or form of money"", or followed other federal precedent. US v Ulbricht, for instance, suggests that cryptocurrencies are considered money equivalents.\n\nBased on these precedents, the court could have concluded that bitcoin was ""monetary value,"" under Florida’s money transmission statute.\n\nInstead, it relied on the IRS classification of cryptocurrencies (called ""virtual currencies"" in the IRS Guidance) as property, and upon the Florida Office of Financial Regulation’s Declaratory Statement Final Order entered in In re: Moon Inc, which held that a bitcoin kiosk network that sold bitcoins to people was not engaged in money transfer.\n\nIn In re: Moon Inc, the petitioner explained that bitcoins were ""a unit of digital property"", and argued that their bitcoin kiosks that sold bitcoin for cash did not transmit money under Florida law.\n\nThe Court’s conclusion in Espinoza appears to be consistent with both IRS guidance and In re: Moon Inc. Although support exists for either conclusion, the court chose a more liberal approach.\n\nEvaluating impact\n\nWhat is clear is that the determination made was based upon analysis of Florida’s specific money transfer laws. (If other states laws materially vary, this precedent will probably not apply).\n\nThe court’s analysis of the money laundering claim did not relate to anything intrinsic about bitcoin.\n\nTo the contrary, the court presumed that a sale of bitcoin for fiat currency is a ""financial transaction"" under Florida\'s statute because US dollars were used. The specific statute at issue required the party selling the bitcoin to demonstrate its intent to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership or control of the property or to avoid a transaction reporting requirement, as opposed to mere knowledge of the other party’s intent.\n\nThus, the government would have to prove that Espinoza had the intent, along with the purchaser, to engage in an illegal activity. The Court ultimately treated Espinoza like (here comes the bad analogy) a bank that dispenses money through its ATM – whether the person receiving the cash uses it to buy dinner or illegal drugs, the bank is not responsible, absent some showing of the bank’s intent to facilitate the nefarious use of the cash.\n\nThis inquiry, critically, is fact specific. (It depends on facts to show the transacting party’s intent, and thus, likely not of presidential value).\n\nAs noted by Stephen Palley, even the legal conclusions of the Espinoza opinion are of limited precedential value; the conclusions may be reargued, or appealed.\n\nEven if Espinoza is not appealed, another court in Florida could reach a different decision under similar facts, and it would be up to an appellate court to review both orders and resolve the conflict.\n\nJudge Pooler directly called for Florida’s legislature to revisit its money laundering statutes in Espinoza. It is possible, given the attention created by the opinion, that Florida’s legislature may change its laws to establish its own policy on cryptocurrencies. One lawmaker has already said she intends to do just that.\n\nUltimately that may be Espinoza’s legacy – forcing Florida’s legislators to address bitcoin.\n\nHopefully, Florida’s Legislature will consider the impact of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and craft legislation to balance their potential for abuse with their potential to foster innovation, create jobs and generate wealth, and to toe the line of protecting consumers while still between permitting experimentation and innovation.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Today, 24 of the most influential Bitcoin companies have expressed their support by participating in an innovative hybrid security model, which incorporates a private Federation.\n\nThe Federation will provide services that are “indispensable to use Smart Contracts in practical scenarios,” according to the startup. These include oracle services, external security checkpoints, and acting as notaries in a much anticipated two-way peg that will finally allow Bitcoin to use sidechains.\n\n- Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, CEO, RSK Labs\n\nAlthough RSK Labs hopes more will join in an ongoing basis, the starting line-up of companies in the RSK Federation includes: Bitcointoyou, Bitex, Bitfinex, bitFlyer, Bitgo, Bitoasis, Bitpay, Bitso, Bits of Gold, Bitstamp, Blockchain, Blockchain Intelligence Group, Blocktrail, BTCC, BitKan, JAXX, SurBTC, CoinBR, Huobi, OKCoin, Paycase, Tether, Unocoin, and Xapo. Each new member of the Federation helps decentralize and add security to the entire network.\n\nToday’s announcement was part of a roadmap published in March, when RSK raised $1M to further develop the project.\n\nDuring the third quarter, RSK will continue to add Federation members, add new use cases for the RSK platform, and additional hashing power to the RSK merge-mining network.\n\nThe release of their next beta version is almost upon us now. A full launch of the production network, dubbed Ginger, is slated for Q1 2017.\n\n“Leading Bitcoin companies will integrate a Federation that will play the fundamental role of securing the transfer of funds between the Bitcoin and Rootstock blockchains,” the Rootstock Whitepaper from December 2015 reads. “In exchange for that they will profit from the fees generated by the settlement between the inflow and outflow of funds.”\n\nThis transfer to and from the Bitcoin blockchain to a Secondary blockchain, or sidechain, relies on a 2-way peg (2WP). RSK settled on a “Multi-sig Federation” 2WP that allows bitcoin miners to mine both chains at once without loss in efficiency, known as a merge-mining.\n\n“A better way to implement a 2WP is having a group of notaries control of a multi-signature,” RSK explained, “where the majority of them has to approve the unlock of funds.”\n\nThis design works better than having a centralized controller of the funds, for various reasons, but still has some degree of centralization due to the relatively small number of Federation members. “To achieve true decentralization,” RSK continues, “the notaries should be carefully selected so they are located in different jurisdictions, different geographies, and each having good reputation and good security. Also they must not be too few, nor too many.”\n\nAs a scaling solution for bitcoin, these Federated sidechains should offer a large but untested amount of transaction scalability.\n\n- RSK\n\nThe Rootstock development team have said on several occasions that the platform is compatible with Ethereum, and were quick to offer support to the recently divided blockchain, “We decided to make our virtual machine (RVM) completely compatible with Ethereum’s VM. We admire all the people and their effort devoted to developing this standard.”\n\n“The recent episode with The DAO has exposed how important is to adopt the most rigorous security measures within the smart contract industry in order to promote real use cases,” said RSK in their announcement. “These measures, along with the power of the Bitcoin network, will enable RSK to transform our society through the development of direct democracies, digital identity, financial inclusion and the Internet of things.”\n\nMeanwhile, RSK has been designed to offer all of the benefits of a Turing-complete smart contract platform on a blockchain, much like Ethereum. Instead of requiring an additional cryptocurrency as a 'gas' to make it work and charge fees through, RSK runs purely on bitcoin, creating an economic benefit for its users from the start.\n\n- Wences Casares, CEO of Xapo"", 'New research from financial services giant Credit Suisse seeks to analyze the impact of blockchain on 14 existing market participants and their stock performance.\n\nWritten in response to investor questions, companies examined include major exchanges (the Australian Securities Exchange and Nasdaq), incumbent business process facilitators (Computershare and Equiniti) as well as financial services providers (Experian and JPMorgan).\n\nThe 135-page report, released today, highlights four areas where the technology can potentially lead to disruption – payments, capital markets, financial services and media. Ultimately, however, the report concludes the stock performance of select firms in these categories will not be significantly impacted.\n\nThe report reads:\n\n""Our broadest conclusion is that blockchain is less relevant in sectors where there has already been significant investment and innovation.""\n\nOverall, the report is more bullish on blockchain than bitcoin, a statement that echoes similar findings from research efforts commissioned by incumbents.\n\nThe report also sketches out 13 barriers to bitcoin, questioning the digital currency’s ability to scale to Visa-level transactions and noting its current slow transaction processing times.\n\nThe authors argue, however, that blockchain tech more generally is better positioned for a broader impact.\n\n""We find blockchain more easily optimizable to different objectives than bitcoin and think three key properties – disintermediation of trust, immutable record and smart contracts – endow the technology with real advantages to legacy systems,"" it reads.\n\nThe biggest impact areas, the report said, would likely be financial services, exchanges and post-trade settlement.\n\nOf all the public companies studied, Credit Suisse determined most faced no near-term threat from blockchain, and that the technology in fact offers long-term opportunities in four areas.\n\nPayments\n\nThough it acknowledges that it\'s impossible to know where blockchain will ultimately be used, the report argues changes provoked by blockchain are inevitable.\n\nPayments, an industry that includes merchant acquirers, card issuers and financial payments processors, is one big, well-established industry that bitcoin and blockchain could potentially transform, according to the report.\n\nBut Credit Suisse thinks that the industry’s big players don’t need worry about being uprooted by blockchain.\n\n""We think it unlikely that bitcoin will gain traction as a mainstream payments network, or that blockchain will disintermediate the globally trusted brands of the card networks such as Visa and MasterCard,"" the report reads, adding:\n\n""On balance we view the existential threat to the industry as modest.""\n\nThe report argues that this is also true of payment processing firm Worldpay, adding that the fears of blockchain overtaking the company are exaggerated. Fiserv, it said, is also ""well positioned to compete"".\n\nCapital markets\n\nFor capital markets participants, Credit Suisse saw more opportunity than risk as well.\n\nThe report evaluated specifically how custodians, exchanges and registrars would be affected by blockchains, concluding they could offer a new approach to data management. The end result, the report posits, is that the way capital markets are constructed could change, but they would be more resilient and less costly.\n\nThough the report argues the winners and losers will be difficult to predict, it said existing incumbents are “best positioned” to reap profits created by blockchain tech while suggesting some consolidation could occur.\n\nAs such, the report asserts exchanges such as ASX will see ""little downside risk"", while the London Stock Exchange’s and Japan Exchange Group’s exposure was similarly low. Business process facilitators were also evaluated in this section, though the report called concerns about their business models “overplayed”.\n\nFinancial services\n\nOn this topic, the report sought to describe how the use of a distributed ledger, or multiple distributed ledgers, could impact banking and financial services.\n\nUltimately, it described two market opportunities it believes are likely to occur. In one, a shared ledger cuts costs by processing securities trades and facilitating international payments. In the other, share ledgers result in more data on clients, boosting the ability of firms to sell to consumers.\n\nThe report argues that at least some adoption of blockchain by financial services is likely, based on its analysis of banks like Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase, Experian and Santander, which have shown varying degrees of interest. But major impact is expected to take three to five years.\n\nAt the very least, according to the report, the rise of blockchain has motivated banks to take a closer look at their underlying IT structures.\n\n“This means the future banking landscape and both the size and allocation of profits from banking may change substantially,"" it reads.\n\nNotably, it calls Goldman Sachs ""among best positioned"" to reap blockchain benefits, and draws similarly positive conclusions about the outlook for JPMorgan Chase, Experian and Santander.\n\nMedia\n\nThe report also explores how blockchain could disintermediate non-financial companies, a hot topic especially since the rise of ethereum, the smart contract computing platform.\n\nIt focuses on media use cases, including music, TV, pay TV, digital video and publishing, arguing, the tech could come to reduce piracy.\n\nAs far as the music industry goes, this benefit would require ""total adoption"" of a blockchain-based platform, but the report argues that this sweeping change would require at least five years.\n\nAlyssa Hertig co-authored this report.\n\nStock market report image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The organization reports successful migration from the previously used Proof of Work consensus protocol, similar to that of Bitcoin to a more efficient Proof of Stake consensus protocol.\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160803/395467\n\nThe introduction of Proof of Stake algorithm makes it possible for everyone to get involved in the staking process, without having to invest in specialized equipment like ASICs or mining farms. Anyone who can operate a computer can now take part in the staking by opening their free to use LEOcoin wallet and clicking on a button. By eliminating the need for specialized equipment LEOcoin offers a greener alternative to Bitcoin, drastically reducing the carbon footprint for every newly created coin.\n\nLEOcoin has also introduced a new rewarding structure for staking depending upon the number of coins (stake) held by each participant. Dan Andersson, the co-founder of LEOcoin offers a brief outline of the new rewards structure where those holding 1000 LEOcoins or more will receive about 10 percent returns per year, while those with 5000 and more will receive 15 percent and those with over 50000 will be receiving 20 percent returns on their stake each year.\n\nThere are also new platforms being created to help spread adoption of LEOcoin, as well as other digital currencies. The latest products include My LEO Travel and LEOcoin Merchants. My LEO Travel is a travel and hotel booking platform where people can plan their trip and pay with LEOcoin alongside other payment options. LEOcoin Merchants is a recently launched site that displays merchants and businesses who are happy to accept LEOcoin in payment for the goods and services.\n\nLEOcoin is a digital currency created in 2014 by the LEOcoin Foundation for entrepreneurs and businesses. The digital currency allows individuals to make fast and secure transactions over a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Like Bitcoin, LEOcoin offers a certain degree of anonymity and it is simple and easy to use. The Proof of Stake algorithm used in LEOcoin also ensures active community participation, further strengthening the network every passing day.\n\nLEOcoin has been appreciated by various diplomats and bureaucrats from across the world. They have also extended their support to the digital currency ecosystem created by LEOcoin. The founders of LEOcoin have participated in various international events and gatherings, rubbing shoulders with powerful people from governments who are striving to promote entrepreneurship and businesses in their home countries and outside alike. Recently, LEOcoin was supported by a representative from the Chinese Embassy to the United Kingdom among others in an event which saw diplomats from over 20 countries in attendance.\n\nAbout LEOcoin\n\nLEOcoin is a cryptocurrency conceptualized by the well-known UK-based entrepreneurial skills training company Learning Enterprises Organization. LEOcoin is a decentralized, easy to use peer to peer digital currency maintained by LEOcoin Foundation.

It will make it easy for users to obtain a wide variety of commonly prescribed medications. It will also help regarding anonymity as it is committed to protecting its customers’ privacy.\n\nUnited Pharmacies added that it is always striving to take all measures necessary to protect their personal information. Bitcoin use will make it easier to protect its customers’ information.\n\nUnited Pharmacies stated on its website that:\n\nAll order details remain confidential and deliveries are discreetly packaged in cardboard boxes with no markings regarding “medication” or “pharmacy.”\n\nTo use bitcoin on the website, the customer needs to first have a wallet set up to store bitcoins. The wallet would also be used to gain access to a bitcoin buying platform. This would be after the amount of bitcoin needed for the order has been confirmed to the customer by United Pharmacies via email.\n\nThe process will make the customer hold the bitcoins for a short period. It will also protect against potential bitcoin wallet security issues before the purchase through United Pharmacies bitcoin wallet address.\n\nUnited Pharmacies will acknowledge the payment immediately and ship out the order based on the order number sent as the note or message with the bitcoin transfer.\n\nThe pharmacy has guaranteed refund and replacement policies and all prices listed on its website are in U.S. dollars.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Last month, the European Commission published a draft directive proposing to extend anti-money laundering (AML) regulation to both virtual currency exchange services and custodial wallet providers. The draft suggests that many Bitcoin companies operating within the European Union will need to apply know-your-customer (KYC) types of checks on their users, to be enforced by 2017.\n\nPhrasing of the directive left some uncertainty over its extent, however —in particular over what are considered “wallet providers offering custodial services of credentials necessary to access virtual currencies.”\n\nFor clarification, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to E.U. representatives.\n\nIntent\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, the E.U. representatives (who preferred not to be mentioned by name or quoted directly) explained that the concept and motive of the proposal is straightforward.\n\nFrom the perspective of the European Commission, virtual currencies present a problem as they allow money to circulate easily, and it's difficult to know who's transacting with whom. To address this, the E.U. wants to set up checkpoints: Custodian wallet providers and exchange services would be required to monitor transactions on their platform and report suspicious activity.\n\nWithin that context, the representatives acknowledged that the proposed regulation should not apply to any services that happen to hold onto customer private keys. There is, for instance, no intention to regulate Lightning Network nodes or mining pool operators.\n\nCustodial wallet providers, under the provision, are wallet providers that hold onto at least one private key for customers. Naturally, that includes wallet providers that hold full control over users' private keys, such as Circle and Xapo. But it also includes services that hold onto a single key in a multi-signature setup, even if they can't spend on behalf of customers, such as GreenAddress or Blocktrail. Wallet providers that do not hold any private keys at all — like Mycelium or Blockchain — would not fall under the provision.\n\nThe E.U. representatives also indicated there might be further discussion on a potential minimum threshold. Under the current proposal, any custodial wallet provider, as well as exchange service, would be required to apply AML/KYC checks on customers — even for trivial amounts. The representatives indicated this may be reconsidered to perhaps introduce a minimum threshold under which no identity verification would be required. (But this is not guaranteed.)\n\nAnonymity\n\nAnother part of the draft directive that garnered attention is a paragraph pertaining to future research. Specifically, the European Commission suggests that users and Bitcoin addresses may have to be able to be linked to prevent nefarious use of the digital currency.\n\nThe draft directive reads:\n\n“The inclusion of virtual exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers will not entirely address the issue of anonymity attached to virtual currency transactions, as a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without exchange platforms or custodian wallet providers. To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.”\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, the E.U. representatives acknowledged that these ideas will be further assessed — but not any time soon. Specifically, a report scheduled for 2019 will explore the options and potentially make recommendations.\n\nMoreover, as specified in the draft, the intent at this point is merely to allow users a voluntary choice to self-declare addresses. The E.U. representatives confirmed that there are as of yet no plans to make non-declaration illegal. The representatives suggested that users may choose to self-declare their addresses, however, in order to increase the credibility and use of virtual currencies, as their anonymous nature can be seen as a threat.\n\nThe legislative proposal is currently in the preliminary discussion phase; there may still be modifications at both the European Parliament and the European Council levels. At least one initiative, coming from the Netherlands, has been started to adjust the proposal, most importantly removing KYC/AML requirements for wallet providers."", 'The U.K. government has awarded the first G-Cloud blockchain platform-as-a-service (PaaS) agreement to Credits for the supply of secure Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) to its public sector.\n\nThe Crown Commercial Service (CCS) made the award for U.K. public sector organizations. It will enable central and local government and the devolved administrations, health, education, and emergency services, to use Credits’ PaaS.\n\nThe platform will supply them with distributed ledger technology (DLT) software and cloud-based services. Secure and scalable blockchains power enterprise and public sector applications would be built by these services. It will enable the building and deployment of secure, enterprise-grade and interoperable DLT services.\n\nAccording to Deloitte, blockchain can help address inefficiencies and increase effectiveness in public systems. It can help in back-office functions and to reduce frauds and errors.\n\nThe U.K. has been considering government applications of blockchain technology for some time. In April, Minister for Cabinet Office Matt Hancock said they are supporting the Alan Turing Institute with £10 million. The support is to investigate digital currencies and DLTs for possible use cases for blockchains in government.\n\nHancock said:\n\nThink about the Student Loans Company tracking money all the way from Treasury to a student’s bank account. Or the Department for International Development tracking money all the way to the aid organization spending the money in [the] country.\n\nCredits said the idea is to use DLT to create more powerful and robust identity management tools. It is also to preserve data security for government departments and agencies.\n\nOn the new agreement, CEO & Co-Founder of Credits, Nick Williamson, said:\n\nCredits is pleased to have been awarded a place on the G-Cloud 8 platform. We are excited by the huge potential of Distributed Ledger Technology for many different government and public sector applications, and are looking forward to working with UK public sector organisations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their services for UK taxpayers.\n\nRecently, Credits won ‘Best Blockchain Startup’ at the 2016 Europas Awards.

08/04/2016,"['Hong Kong Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex announced that it had been hacked and 119,756 Bitcoins stolen which at current prices represents nearly US $69 million. Bitcoin prices dropped 20% after word of the hack became public but the price has since recovered.\n\nIt is not clear how the hackers were able to get hold of the cryptographic keys that protected the stolen Bitcoins. Bitfinex had instituted a new way of protecting its accounts that involved multiple signatures, one of which was held by BitGo, the creators of the system that was supposed to keep the Bitcoin accounts safe from exactly this type of hack.\n\nThe hack is the second largest in a long line of hacks that have targeted Bitcoin. The biggest hack was that of Mt Gox in which 744,408 Bitcoin were stolen over a 2 year period. All of the hacks have essentially targeted Bitcoin’s main weakness which is how to store the details of the Bitcoin accounts safely.\n\nA Bitcoin account is actually a cryptographic private key which links back to transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain. If the private key is lost, so are the Bitcoins that were associated with it. Likewise, if someone steals the private key, they have access to all of the Bitcoin that are associated with it.\n\nKeeping the private key associated with Bitcoin safe has proved a challenge. The safest place for a private key is in “cold storage” somewhere that is not attached to the Internet. This means potentially on a USB drive or in specialised encrypted devices called hardware wallets. The simplest way is to simply write the number down on a piece of paper.\n\nWith all of these solutions, keeping them safe from being lost or damaged is still an issue. Devices and USB drives can also fail raising the possibility of losing the information stored on them. There is also the issue that at some point, they have to be connected to a network to access the Bitcoin and at that point, they could be compromised.\n\nFor exchanges, the issue with storing Bitcoin in cold wallets is that it limits their customers’ access to funds and so exchanges always keep a certain quantity of Bitcoin in “hot wallets”. Bitfinex and BitGo had trumpeted the security of their multi-signature protection of customers’ wallets but according to other exchanges that are also using multi-signature mechanisms, it might have been the way Bitfinex had implemented their specific version of the system that was at fault.\n\nWhat is remarkable is that despite the magnitude of the hack, the Bitcoin price has started recovering and everyone not directly involved in the loss of Bitcoins have carried on as if nothing had happened. It is possibly a testament to the completely decentralised nature of Bitcoin that problems like this are considered to be isolated issues and not systemic problems. Loss of Bitcoins is treated in the same way as the potential loss in value of the currency that occur on a daily basis through its ongoing volatility.\n\nIt also indicates that the demand for Bitcoin is still robust because not only has it shrugged off hacks of this type but it seemingly has not reacted negatively to the “halving” of the reward given to Bitcoin miners that occurred in July. There was an expectation (including my own), that the halving would have made the economics of mining even more unfavourable. In the past few months however, Bitcoin’s price has rallied partially mitigating this effect.\n\nIt is worth stressing that the vulnerability exploited by the hackers was not associated with Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology as some seem to have suggested. At the time of preparing this article, Bitfinex was still offline with no indication of what the problems were that led to the hack. Whether customers flee the site when they are allowed to access funds or not is yet to be seen. To everyone else though, this is just another day in the never dull world of cryptocurrencies.', 'From its mysterious origin story to its ties to black market dealings, Bitcoin has been closely watched since its emergence in 2009. But the digital currency hasn’t captured attention for controversial reasons alone. Many believe the underlying technology that powers bitcoin transactions, a system known as blockchain, has the potential to upend how Wall Street does business.\n\nAt its most basic level, a blockchain is a new means of structuring and distributing data. It allows financial companies and other institutions to create a digital ledger guarded by cryptography that can be shared among participants in a transaction. This makes it so that authorized participants can alter the ledger without awaiting approval from a central authority, often resulting in faster and more secure transactions that can save financial institutions time and money.\n\nBitcoin itself is in the throes of a tumultuous year, as the community is divided by deep philosophical differences. But some observers say blockchain will thrive regardless of bitcoin’s fate. More than 100 executives from major Wall Street firms like Citigroup, Visa, and Fidelity recently gathered at Nasdaq’s New York offices to experiment with blockchain. The event was hosted by Chain, a startup that specializes in developing blockchain systems for assets like corporate securities and loyalty points.\n\nTIME recently spoke with Chain CEO and co-founder Adam Ludwin to learn more about blockchain and the potential it holds for Wall Street and beyond. Below is a transcript of our conversation. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTIME: The blockchain system was discovered and popularized through bitcoin. How will Wall Street use blockchain technology differently than the bitcoin system does?\n\nLudwin: This whole idea for a blockchain was invented to solve this double spending problem that had been challenging computer scientists for a long time. And in the bitcoin whitepaper, all of these concepts were put together in a very elegant way that launched a new Internet-based network that was open and decentralized.\n\nThe problem is, we have to adopt a new currency with bitcoin should we want to use it. So I can send bitcoin to Vietnam and that’s wonderful and very powerful, however that means I have to get bitcoin and my receiver needs to be willing to accept it.\n\nAnd then beyond that, the senders and receivers have to be willing to essentially adopt the governance, scalability, and transparency features of bitcoin. And by the way, I don’t think bitcoin is a failure. I think bitcoin, despite all the controversy, is alive and well today. The reason that we’re doing something else is that we’re not interested in moving bitcoin. Bitcoin has already solved that. We’re interested in building new networks that move dollars, stocks, bonds, loyalty points, gift cards, you name it, in the same manner with the same speed and directness that bitcoin moves.\n\nThere has been a lot of buzz about how blockchain technology could make financial transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure. Can you go into more detail about how exactly it will do that, and where we’ll see the most impact?\n\n[One example] is in the realm of international payments. If you look at how an international wire transfer today occurs, what we have is a messaging system called SWIFT, which is essentially a fancy financial email between banks. So messages get sent, and those messages trigger the movement of money from bank to to bank on several hops, depending on where the receiver is and where the sender is. And that whole process can take several days and can eat up several percentage points of the payment amount.\n\nIf we can put currency into a native digital format, instead of sending an electronic message, we can send the assets themselves electronically. The difference is what these cryptographic databases known as blockchains bring to the world. If we can do that, if we can send the assets themselves as opposed to just sending messages, then I can pay a supplier in Vietnam as fast as I can send an email to Vietnam.\n\nThe second example is in the capital markets. In the United States, on one hand we have high frequency trading, but once those trades are filled, we have extremely low frequency clearing and settlement systems. In other words, we can match an order in nanoseconds, but it still takes three days for the securities and cash to eventually swap between the counter-parties.\n\nJust like in the international payments arena, we have a messaging system for sending trade information between institutions, and then we have a separate system for how we hold on to and move the assets themselves. And the difference between those messages and the actual asset movement are all of the steps, like authorization, clearing, settlement, error handling and so on, which are essentially the agreement of the middle and back office of Wall Street.\n\nWhen people say blockchain technology will change clearing and settlement, what that really means is that blockchain technology will make clearing and settlement redundant. It’s as if I gave you a 10 dollar bill, and then asked you how do we clear and settle that payment. You would look at me funny, because it doesn’t make sense.\n\nThere’s also been some talk about how blockchain systems could be applied to other industries. A note from Goldman Sachs, for example, outlined how blockchain databases could be used to manage the identities of Airbnb hosts. What are your thoughts on that?\n\nWe view a blockchain functionally as a next generation database for financial assets. We think for most non-financial use cases, traditional database technology is suitable. And the reason for that comes down to what the fundamental purpose of using a blockchain architecture is. The purpose is: when you need to stretch your database over an entire market, so that when you move your assets from point A to point B, it does not leave a copy at point A. In other words, where we can make a recorded electronic asset function like cash, where I just hand you cash and we’re done.\n\nBut take, for example, a use case that gets thrown around a lot, which is health records. If I send my health records to my doctor, I also want a copy of my health records. Or if my general practitioner sends a copy of my health records to a specialist, do I want them to disappear from the general practitioner’s office? No, I don’t.\n\nWall Street is starting to experiment with blockchain technology. What are the biggest challenges these firms are facing so far with blockchain adoption, and do you think our financial system will ever run entirely on digital assets alone?\n\nWe’re definitely moving toward this model. There’s no doubt in my mind, based on the projects we’re working on and what we’re seeing. The main challenge right now is that institutions by and large are still asking the wrong questions with respect to blockchain technology. They’re asking, how can we use blockchain to streamline our middle and back office? How can we use blockchain technology to make our operation more efficient?\n\nThe question you need to ask as an executive is, what role do we want to play in that new network model?

It will also offer a white-label option, which means that you can use the hosting service with your own domain name for free. Plus, it’ll also fetch remotely hosted files (that aren’t stored on your server) that you link to, and upload them to your account.Dotcom added that it will offer increased anonymity and will be “a nightmare for those who want to mass surveil & censor.”\n\n#Megaupload 2.0 takes decentralization, anonymity & encryption to the next level. A nightmare for those who want to mass surveil & censor. — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) August 5, 2016\n\nIn addition, he said that Megaupload file transfers will be linked to Bitcoin microtransactions, which seems to indicate that users who upload files that are frequently download will earn some cryptocurrency for their efforts.\n\nDotcom also mentioned something called Bitcache, which might be a Bitcoin wallet tied to your Megaupload account. It isn’t clear how this will work, but Dotcom said that the ‘cache’ in Bitcache refers to a solution to Bitcoin’s existing blockchain limitations.\n\nThat’s a lot to look forward to, and it’ll certainly be interesting to see if Dotcom can make it all happen next year. He predicts that his new ventures will cause the value of Bitcoin to surge to $2,000 in 2017, up from the current exchange rate of about $579.\n\nShould you bet on Bitcoin as strongly as Dotcom is? It’s hard to say at this point. We’ll have to wait and see if Megaupload and its associated cryptocurrency products are all they’re cracked up to be, and there’s also the ever-present danger of theft.

Now, some bitcoiners are looking to do the same.\n\nEthereum\'s mostly-successful fork seems to have inspired a sizeable corner of the bitcoin community, which is rallying inside a new subreddit—created on Tuesday—called /r/btcfork. For more than a year, bitcoin has been mired in an unending debate about whether to hard fork the currency in order to change bitcoin\'s code and apply what some see as desperately-needed features. That debate had largely petered out, until now.\n\nA new subforum on one of the world\'s largest message boards isn\'t a huge development in itself, but it\'s also the first movement on the hard fork that bitcoin has seen in awhile. The mandate of /r/btcfork is to discuss how to implement a hard fork, not to argue about whether or not it\'s the right way forward. In the last 48 hours, the subreddit has gained nearly 700 members, indicating that it\'s a popular idea.\n\nThe person who created the subreddit, ""singularity87,"" told me in a message that they\'ve been involved in bitcoin since 2011, and although they aren\'t a ""big name"" in the community, singularity87 prefers to stay pseudonymous for now due to the acrimonious tone of the hard fork debate thus far. To call the idea of a hard fork in bitcoin ""contentious"" would be a massive understatement, with each faction of bitcoin (developers, regular users, and miners) fighting to represent their interests.\n\n""One of the main reasons I created the subreddit was to make sure there was a lot of community participation in this process,"" singularity87 wrote me in a message.\n\nDespite the attention the subreddit has garnered, a post titled ""Are you serious?"" sums up some popular criticisms of the push: Namely, that singularity87 doesn\'t seem to have a plan or a dedicated team of developers behind his renewed call for a hard fork.\n\nSingularity87 claims, however, that another Reddit user—""ftrader""—has begun work on the code for the hard fork, and that they started a private Slack channel for developers and stakeholders to discuss the fork before the subreddit was created.\n\nThe apparent lack of a plan is highly concerning. As Ethereum\'s own hard fork showed, things can go awry in unexpected ways. When that hard fork happened, most assumed that the old version of Ethereum would simply wither and die as users moved over to the new, updated version. Instead, users mounted a rebellion and rallied around the old chain, turning it into a currency with its own value.\n\n""Some plan of action is already materialising,"" singularity87 wrote. ""There will be more information coming out about this soon.""\n\nIt\'s unlikely that many in bitcoin will see /r/btcfork as a serious movement until it has a public plan of action. Until then, this nascent rebellion has all the hallmarks of a big nothing, or worse, a disastrously ill-planned hard fork. But at this point in bitcoin\'s history, only one thing is for sure, really: anything can happen.', 'BITCOIN\n\nAs more people start to dip their toes into the cryptocurrency waters, two companies are making it their goal to curb nefarious uses of the digital currency.\n\nElliptic, a blockchain intelligence firm, is collaborating with LexisNexis Risk Solutions to bring into market a bank-grade risk management to digital currency like bitcoin.\n\nLexisNexis is known for providing traditional banks with anti-money laundering risk management data, and this is what Elliptic is looking to tap into to boost its bitcoin transaction monitoring and compliance products.\n\nTogether, the two developed a service that they said will help financial services firms sniff out suspicious transactions, especially from those heightened-risk people or groups that are on global watch lists.\n\n“This is a step towards making it (bitcoin) more mainstream and more acceptable,” LexisNexis’s Thomas Brown told Reuters.\n\nBitcoin, as we all know, is popular for its complex algorithms that allow users to anonymously move around money quickly without a need for a central authority to process transactions. Bitcoin’s underlying technology—blockchain—has made it attractive to a variety of users, including those who want a currency that is free from government control.\n\nThe digital currency, however, has also become the currency of choice on the dark side of the Internet.\n\n“Today, if you see bitcoins transacting, you almost assume they’re from someone who wants to be off the grid, or they’re proceeds from illicit transactions,” Brown said.\n\nElliptic and LexisNexis’s product isn’t the first attempt to mitigate the risks of the popular digital currency being used for disreputable activities.

On this, the MGA planned to collaborate with Malta’s Central Bank, the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit and the Malta Financial Services Authority.\n\nWhatever the MGA decides to do in the future, its current stance runs counter to the prevailing trend. The UK Gambling Commission just announced that its licensees can include digital currencies in their roster of payment options and the Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission proposed earlier this year to allow its licensees to use “convertible virtual currencies.”\n\nThe MGA is currently developing legislation to update its gaming regime. There will be a consultation period with stakeholders in September before the final draft is delivered to parliament and the hope is that the new regime will take effect in March 2017.\n\nCuschieri said the MGA was looking to simplify its licensing regime, envisioning a day when the MGA would issue only two classes of licenses: business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C). This streamlined approach “will simply the compliance and approval processes,” and, more importantly, “do away with unnecessary costs.”\n\nCuschieri had harsh words for many of the European betting monopolies that have sought to protect their fiefdoms, saying the proper approach was to “desist from creating frontiers and barriers” that treat rival operators as “criminals.”\n\nComments']"

The company reported $1.25 trillion under management in 2016, has operations in about 50 countries, and 47,180 employees from over 150 different nations.\n\nThe company’s Equity Research team recently released an in depth report on blockchain, “Shared ledger technology and the impact on stocks."" The 135 page document contains a reassessment of the company\'s view on the extent to which bitcoin and its underlying technology present a, ”disruptive threat and/or opportunity to global incumbents.”\n\n- Shared ledger technology and the impact on stocks\n\nThe report details some of the underlying concepts and technology behind blockchain, in a “deep dive explaining the benefits of a shared ledger,” and how it can structurally disintermediate trusted third parties.\n\nThe authors also explain some of the fundamental cryptography and consensus forming characteristics of a blockchain: “These fundamentals expose some of the challenges blockchain faces in balancing security and anonymity with the constraints of scaleability and cost.”\n\n- Shared ledger technology and the impact on stocks\n\nWhile blockchain may be a solution searching for a problem, Credit Suisse states that Bitcoin will remain a niche payment network. The report names 13 barriers to mainstream bitcoin adoption, including two that many bitcoin proponents see as advantageous.\n\nTransaction confirmation is too slow, states the report. While a 10 minute transaction time is widely touted as a positive attribute, transactions with lower fees can take 40 plus minutes on average: “Once recorded in the blockchain, transactions shouldn’t be considered settled until they are six blocks deep – another 60 minutes.”\n\nThe fees are another point of contention. While costs are hidden, they aren’t removed, the report claims. “The energy intensive and expensive transaction confirmation process (mining) is incentivized by the coin-reward which itself is funded by the issuance of new BTC. Recently halved from 25BTC to 12.5BTC per block, this raises the questions over future funding gaps, and energy inefficiency.”\n\n- Shared ledger technology and the impact on stocks\n\nTo gain mainstream relevance, the report states that bitcoin would need to be capable of scale comparable to large payment processers. This would require a change to the protocol, and leads to the next barrier, “Internal conflict and inertia.”\n\nPotential risks include bitcoin’s growing pains intensifying should the technology ‘cross the chasm,’ developer infighting and intransigence, internal conflict resulting in decision inertia, and bitcoin potentially failing to adapt to match user demands at the protocol level.\n\nVolatility is also mentioned, reducing bitcoins utility as a value store and payment method, although its use as a medium for money-laundering and illicit capital flight is also highlighted. Reduced decentralization is another barrier to bitcoin adoption.\n\n- Shared ledger technology and the impact on stocks\n\nRegulatory risk, which is “inherent for disruptive technologies,” is also a problem. So are exchanges and wallet software, “both of which take on responsibilities akin to ‘trusted third parties,’ and are therefore susceptible to fraudulent behavior.”\n\nUnguaranteed security stands out as an unusual topic of contention, not often mentioned in research papers: “There is no mandated minimum security threshold for the bitcoin network. The blockchain would continue to be updated at a total hash-rate of 10/s, or when a single node had 100% of the hash-power.”\n\n- Shared ledger technology and the impact on stocks\n\nIrrecoverability is also an issue: “It is a testament to the security of the network that should your private key be lost, the BTC associated with that address are fully unrecoverable. Equally, it is a barrier to widespread adoption.” This barrier goes hand in hand with Irreversibility, “There is no authority or mechanism for error correction.”\n\n“In contrast,” states the report, the underlying blockchain is “a distributed database that holds a secure and immutable record of past transactions,” a “key differentiator in the ability to disrupt.”\n\n“In our view, many barriers to mainstream adoption mean bitcoin doesn’t appear to present a disruptive threat,” states the report. Meanwhile, blockchain shared ledger technology, “may have features that could prove disruptive to multiple industries.”\n\nThe broadest conclusion is that blockchain is less relevant in sectors where there has already been significant investment and innovation. Consumer payments and pre-trade execution already takes place in milliseconds, the report argues, “it is hard to see how blockchain could materially improve this efficiency.”\n\nHowever, in sectors where there is more friction, “blockchain has the potential to materially disrupt the landscape.” The buzz surrounding blockchain is compared to that surrounding the internet in the late 1980s.\n\n- Shared ledger technology and the impact on stocks\n\nDespite listing eight key challenges that have the potential to limit the utility, and therefore reduce adoption of blockchain systems, the report states that “a shared ledger has many advantages over classic centralized systems. Maintaining a distributed authoritative \'source of truth\' rather than siloed ledgers has the potential to drastically reduce duplication, decrease transaction costs and improve transparency.”', ""The controversial entrepreneur Kim Dotcom said last month that he was preparing to relaunch Megaupload, the file-sharing site that U.S. and New Zealand authorities dramatically shut down in 2012, with bitcoins being involved in some way.\n\nNow we know more. Dotcom, a German-Finnish man living in New Zealand and currently fighting extradition to the U.S. over copyright-infringement charges, tweeted Friday that the transfers taking place over Megaupload would be linked to very small bitcoin transactions.\n\nThis system will be called Bitcache and Dotcom claimed its launch would send the bitcoin price soaring way above its current $575 value.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nEvery #Megaupload file transfer will be linked to a tiny #Bitcoin micro transaction. Get ready for Bitcache. pic.twitter.com/0viV2sJ9ax — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) August 5, 2016\n\nNobody will upload to any other cloud after Megaupload's Bitcache goes live. 100 million Bitcache wallets. Bitcoin = $2000+ 2017 — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) August 5, 2016\n\nThe launch of Megaupload 2.0 will take place on Jan. 20, 2017, he said, urging people to “buy bitcoin while cheap, like right now, trust me.” Bitcoin’s value fell sharply this week after a $72 million theft from the Hong Kong exchange Bitfinex, though it subsequently bounced back to a degree.\n\nCrucially, Dotcom said the Bitcache system would overcome bitcoin’s scaling problems. “It eliminates all blockchain limitations,” he claimed.\n\nBitcoins are “mined” by computers that are racing one another to confirm the transactions taking place over the bitcoin network. Whichever miner first completes the validation of the latest “block” of transactions and adds it to the blockchain (the shared transaction ledger) gets a reward in the form of newly created bitcoins.\n\nThe problem is, the bitcoin system has a hard limit for the size of these blocks—they can’t be bigger than one megabyte. That’s effectively a limit on the number of transactions the bitcoin network can handle, and it’s one thing that’s stopping bitcoin from being useful for high-volume micropayments.\n\nIn theory, bitcoin could be “forked” to create a new version that doesn’t have this block-size limit, but the new version’s adoption would rely on widespread consensus across the bitcoin world.\n\nSo if Kim Dotcom really has solved this scaling problem using bitcoin as it currently exists, that’s a pretty big deal.\n\nFor more on bitcoin, watch our video:\n\nDotcom said Megaupload 2.0 would also be available as a “white label” service that lets people use their own web domains for their “cloud sharing needs.”"", 'Image: Flickr/aisletwentytwo\n\nJust days after Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex was allegedly hacked and lost $65 million worth of customer funds, a Reddit user claiming to be the hacker is running a twisted lottery that has thousands of people lining up to get some of the action.\n\nThe user, who goes by ""rekcahxfb""—that\'s ""bfx hacker"" backwards—claims that they will give away 1,000 bitcoins to one lucky person next Wednesday. As of today\'s bitcoin prices, that amounts to $575,520. That could be a ""life changing amount of money,"" as one user put it. For people who lost money in the Bitfinex hack, it could be a lifeline.\n\nA Reddit post by rekcahxfb has racked up more than 4,000 comments from people sharing their public bitcoin addresses, and a thread on the BitcoinTalk forum runs over 170 pages long. One commenter implored: ""Please be my Robin Hood.""\n\nThe prize coins are real, and rekcahxfb controls them. Rekcahxfb posted a message and cryptographic signature to go along with the bitcoin address in their post, and when checked against each other with a tool to verify bitcoin signatures, they returned a green ""verified"" notification. There\'s just one problem: the coins that rekxahxfb plans to give away were transferred into their wallet three years ago, making it an impossibility that they came from the Bitfinex hack, which happened earlier this week.\n\nWho rekcahxfb is, or why they want to give away coins now while pinning it on the Bitfinex hacker, is a mystery. Motherboard reached out to rekcahxfb and hasn\'t received a response.\n\n""Clearly, it\'s someone who is just playing around with the community""\n\n\n\nThere main theory posited by skeptical commenters is that rekcahxfb, whoever they are, ultimately plans on sending the coins to themselves. Since bitcoin addresses are anonymous, rekcahxfb could theoretically send the coins to an address they posted in the comments while pretending to be just another commenter hoping to win the lottery without any concrete link being drawn between the two. But is rekcahxfb a troll, or the real deal?\n\n""Clearly, it\'s someone who is just playing around with the community,"" Emin Gün Sirer, a hacker and professor at Cornell University, wrote me in an email. ""My first guess was that it\'s someone on a binge from controlled substances, but it has lasted a little too long for that. My second guess is that it\'s someone who came to possess large numbers of coins easily, who is jilted, and wants to debase community members by making them beg for coins.""\n\nThe second possibility is conjecture, Sirer said, but it does make a good deal of sense, if the giveaway is for real. It could be that the coins were stolen during any one of the many hacks and scams that plagued bitcoin in 2013, and the moment of opportunity to pin it on somebody else while having some fun has only presented itself in the wake of the Bitfinex hack.\n\nIn the Wild West of bitcoin, Occam\'s Razor isn\'t always a reliable rule of thumb, but the weight of it nonetheless clearly rests on one possibility here: someone is likely having some very mean fun with some very desperate people.\n\n\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that rekcahxfb is planning on giving away $60,000 worth of bitcoin, when in fact that number is close to $600,000 worth of bitcoin.

It is used by one hundred of the top U.S. banks and the firm also works with eighty percent of U.S. federal agencies, assisting with regulatory compliance and mitigating business risk, such as identity fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion, International Business Times reports.\n\n“This alliance demonstrates how data, technology and analytics can be used in innovative ways to foster financial transparency from China to Germany to the U.S.,” said Thomas C. Brown, senior vice president of U.S. Commercial Markets and Global Market Development at LexisNexis Risk Solutions.\n\n“More banks, Fintech startups, payments companies and eCommerce businesses can further consider the usefulness of the permissionless blockchain because as of today they are able to deploy best-of-breed money laundering screening against Bitcoin. As a result, the virtual currency potential evolves to a new level — from possible conduit for money laundering to trusted technology along the economic value chain.”\n\nDetecting money laundering is complicated because, of course, those who engage in illicit activities put all sorts of smokescreens in place and often have enough money to spend on counter-detection measures. For example, according to data provided by Elliptic, the largest dark marketplaces facilitate more than $250 million in annual sales.\n\n“For the first time, Bitcoin companies can leverage bank-grade risk management practices to identify Bitcoin entities that appear on sanction and watch lists from around the world,” said Dr. James Smith, Elliptic CEO and co-founder. “Having this enriched data set built natively into Elliptic’s products takes Bitcoin AML and KYC controls to the next level.”\n\nSmith added that leading Bitcoin companies globally are using Elliptic products to assess risk on more than $1 billion in Bitcoin transactions each month. “By integrating LexisNexis Risk Solutions’ robust watchlist data, we are making it safe for a new wave of financial institutions to handle Bitcoin and bank Bitcoin companies,” he said.\n\nIts new partnership with LexisNexis has created a service to bring bank-grade anti-money laundering (AML) controls to Bitcoin transactions, making the virtual currency more attractive to those who might want to use it for legitimate transactions, Reuters reports.\n\nAccording to both companies, Bitcoin operators need to demonstrate strict compliance with AML and KYC (know your customer) if they want to be taken seriously in the financial world at large, and therefore the new monitoring solution can help in mainstreaming the emerging distributed ledger economy. However, it’s to be expected that those who want to escape detection — not always for illicit reasons — will increasingly resort to non-Bitcoin alternatives able to provide enhanced privacy.\n\nIn June 2015 Bitcoin Magazine covered the launch of “The Bitcoin Big Bang,” an interactive visualization that plots the emergence and interconnectivity of the key players in Bitcoin since its genesis in 2009. It was described as a breakthrough in Bitcoin transaction monitoring and compliance. According to the company, monitoring and compliance services help digital currency businesses to gain credibility and establish good relations with banks and mainstream financial operators.\n\nOf course, operators such as Elliptic and Chainalysis, a Swiss company that provides similar services, are often criticized by parts of the Bitcoin community, especially libertarian early adopters. However, it seems likely that monitoring and compliance services are here to stay and grow.\n\nImage via Elliptic', 'Although a large proportion of the Ethereum community believed the recent hard fork would result in one chain that the entire community could get behind, it’s clear that a segment of Ethereum enthusiasts would like to see a strict adherence to the original concept of code as law.\n\nEthereum Classic is the original Ethereum blockchain that does not include a patch to reassign misallocated funds back to DAO token holders who had a large portion of their ether stash drained by an attacker who found a flaw in The DAO’s source code.\n\nEver since Poloniex listed the Ethereum Classic coin on their exchange, the market has responded by breathing new life into the original chain. There is now a debate among both communities as to which chain should be used going forward, while others believe both chains should be allowed to grow and prosper.\n\nOn a recent live edition of Let’s Talk Bitcoin held on August 4 and mediated by Andreas Antonopoulos, Stephanie Murphy and Adam Levine, Gnosis founder Martin Köppelmann debated Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson on the merits of Ethereum Classic. Anthony Di Iorio, another Ethereum co-founder, CEO of Decentral and chief digital officer at the Toronto Stock Exchange, also provided his own nuanced opinions on the matter from a business perspective.\n\nThe Case for the Hard-Forked Ethereum\n\nFor Köppelmann, the decision to go with the hard-forked version of the Ethereum blockchain is a practical one. In his view, it is rational for people like Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin to stay with the more popular blockchain because these systems need big enough communities to have value.\n\n“I see, at this point, huge benefits of having one community,” Köppelmann said during the debate. “Ethereum is about network effects. It’s about having all those [decentralized applications] that work well together because they’re on the same world computer, the Ethereum network.\n\n“Currently, we only have those network effects if [everyone] is on the same chain,” Köppelmann added.\n\nThe Gnosis founder also noted that it may be useful to have Ethereum applications work across chains in the future but he still thinks it’s best to focus on one chain for now.\n\nWhile Ethereum Classic has attained more than 20 percent of the Ethereum hashrate at this point, Köppelmann explained that developers do not move to other blockchains so easily. “I’m not looking at short-term price swings,” he said. “I’m in for the long game and building stuff and that will happen on ETH, as far as I can see.”\n\nIn Köppelmann’s view, it’s a better option to stick with one chain while the two networks are so similar. “Of those who were building stuff on Ethereum, most will continue building stuff on Ethereum,” he added.\n\nThe Case for Ethereum Classic\n\nDuring the debate, Hoskinson took the side of Ethereum Classic. He argued that the recent hard fork angered a segment of the Ethereum community and he was also angered, even though he left the project in the summer of 2014.\n\n“What initially attracted me to Ethereum was the social contract of having this world computer where the code is basically law — it runs as written,” said Hoskinson. “A lot of people were really excited about that kind of a prospect.”\n\nHoskinson noted that Ethereum is an expensive, inefficient world computer that is mostly useful in specific situations. His description of Ethereum is comparable to Bitcoin’s usefulness as a censorship-resistant payment method. “The saving grace of the system has always been that you can write code that, regardless of who it’s inconvenient to or the consequences of that code, you have a safe place where you’re able to run that code without fear of censorship,” Hoskinson explained. “That was the initial social contract; that’s what I signed up for.”\n\nHoskinson added that it’s a bit premature to declare which chain will be used by the top developers for their decentralized applications over the long run. He also said miners may have a soft spot for Ethereum Classic because the hard-forked version of the blockchain will eventually move to a proof-of-stake system. Hoskinson also questioned whether it will even matter what chain a developer likes the most in the future:\n\n“There’s probably going to be some effort to start talking about cross-deployment, much like we do with PhoneGap. We use PhoneGap to deploy on multiple ecosystems. I think a lot of people are going to start building tools to deploy on Rootstock as well as Ethereum. It would make no sense to just omit Ethereum Classic, especially if these systems are fairly similar to each other — as they are right now.”\n\nRootstock is an Ethereum-esque platform being developed by RSK Labs as a sidechain to Bitcoin.\n\nIn response to Köppelmann’s view that most developers are going with the hard-forked chain, Hoskinson stated, “[Developers] are coming [to Ethereum Classic]. I’m hiring three full-time developers myself. I have many cryptographers and good developers working for me. ... We will have developers within our space very soon. We already have a lot of volunteer developers within our Slack.”\n\nEthereum Classic: Here to Stay?\n\nAlthough Ethereum Classic was nearly dead before being listed on Poloniex, it now appears that the network will have some staying power as a version of Ethereum with a different social contract than that of the hard-forked chain. Bringing a business perspective to the table, Di lorio noted that he’s just going to react to what his customers want. “As a business owner, I have to look at both sides,” he stated. “People say you have to pick one side or the other and I just don’t believe that.”\n\n“For me, I’m going to make decisions and speak as a business owner who’s a blockchain company,” Di lorio continued. “I’m not an Ethereum company; I’m not a Bitcoin company. We’re supporting Bitcoin; we’re supporting Ethereum. We’ve got Dash coming in next week; we’re going to support them all and let people make their choices.”\n\nAs Hoskinson noted, Ethereum Classic has its own developers and tools that allow developers to release their decentralized applications on any platform and may soon be available. For now, it seems there will be three major networks in the smart contract space: Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Rootstock. “If one keeps going strong and the other [withers] away, OK — that’s fine,” said Di lorio. “We’re going to support what our customers want.”', 'A number of fake Bitcoin wallet mobile apps have been added to the iTunes App Store run by Apple, Inc. very recently, according to a representative from Breadwallet LLC who posted on Reddit. The fake wallets use the same, or very similar, names to existing official mobile wallet apps, but presumably open the user to having their accounts compromised and coins stolen.\n\nIn the words of breadwallet_dan on Reddit, here’s a list of the offending apps:\n\nHere are the new wallets we’ve noticed so far with their exact naming. Please be cautious: GreenAddress – Bitcoin Wallet https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/greenaddress-bitcoin-wallet/id1139753685?mt=8 Simple Bitcoin Wallet https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-bitcoin-wallet/id1138700421?mt=8 Simple Bitcoin Wallet ™ https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-bitcoin-wallet/id1140433170?mt=8 GreenBits Bitcoin Wallet https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/greenbits-bitcoin-wallet/id1138675915?mt=8 Bitcoin Wallet https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bitcoin-wallet/id1137555856?mt=8 Bitcoin Armory Wallet – bitcoin offline wallet https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bitcoin-armory-wallet-bitcoin/id1139569125?mt=8 Blockchain – Offline Bitcoin Wallet https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blockchain-offline-bitcoin/id1140411956?mt=8 BitcoinCore – Bitcoin Wallet https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bitcoincore-bitcoin-wallet/id1140170409?mt=8\n\nDo not download any of these apps, the links above are just for reference. Hopefully as Apple begins to purge these fake apps these links will each stop working.\n\nIn the meantime, Bitcoin wallet users should use links provided on the official websites for the wallet they want to use instead of going through iTunes (or Google Play). This way a user can be sure that the wallet app they are looking at is the official one intended to be downloaded and used by the developer of that app.\n\nFor example, above the fake “GreenAddress” wallet on iTunes has an id number of “id1139753685” but when SiliconANGLE went to GreenAddress’s website it opens up a page for the official GreenAddress iOS app with the id number of “id889740745.” The fake GreenAddress wallet also says that it is from “Green Address” but the official GreenAddress wallet lists “Jersey Studios” as developer.\n\nThis is similar for every link discovered by Breadwallet; each one differs from the app linked from the official website. Clearly it would behoove users to use links only from trusted sites (such as the official developer).\n\nApple’s app review process flawed, failing to stop numerous fake apps\n\nIt is apparent that Apple’s review and vetting process of new apps is not up to snuff as this is not the first time that a fake wallet was added. According to Breadwallet, a fake app pretending to be from the company was added to the App Store on July 29th—to sell the fraud, the fake app used the same name and icon as the official Breadwallet app.\n\nBreadwallet took immediate action and had it removed by contacting Apple, however not before a few customers inadvertently downloaded the fake and reported stolen funds.\n\n“For a long time, it seemed as though Apple’s tight controls over its ecosystem were a fairly impenetrable measure against nefarious applications, malware, and junk,” says John Casaretto, founder of BlackCert, SSL security certificate company. “Clearly, that is not the case anymore and in an instant, the Application Development Signing Certificates, the Apple Developer Program, and the application review process are all negated by a handful of malicious apps that have made their way through. It goes to show that assumptions can get people in trouble, especially when a financial target such as Bitcoin is involved. The best practice is to stick to the source and official apps to stay on the safe side.”\n\nThis is also not the first time that mobile apps have appeared that could target people with Bitcoin wallets. Since the beginning of its popularity, Pokémon GO had third-party downloadable APKs (Android apps), some of which were infected with malware; as previously reported, these sort of backdoored apps could compromise security on Bitcoin wallets stored on the same mobile device.\n\nThis is not just a problem for iTunes, fake apps sneak into Google Play for Android and other marketplaces as well in 2012 numerous fake apps were revealed in Google Play, many of them Trojans masquerading as games or other popular apps. And in 2016, amusingly named “porn clicker” malware infected apps began to spread through the Android ecosystem.\n\nWhen using mobile Bitcoin wallet apps on a phone better be safe than sorry\n\nAs mentioned above, the mobile markets such as the Apple App Store cannot be trusted to deliver the proper name-brand application. Therefore, it is suggested that users go through the official websites of the desired wallet and use their own links to avoid any confusion.\n\nAccording to a report from security outfit Kaspersky Lab, mobile malware tripled in 2015 over 2014 with 884,774 new malicious programs were detected. The number of mobile banking Trojans, fake apps designed to look like mobile banking apps (similar to fake Bitcoin wallets but for banking instead), decreased to 7,030 from 16, 586 in 2014, but that’s still a noticeable number.\n\nUsers should brush up on their mobile security and can start with this resource from MalwareBytes Lab. Numbers 4 (install anti-virus) and 5 (download only from trusted sites, already mentioned) in particular would be necessary to defend against mobile malware. There are a few likely candidates on the market for mobile anti-virus such as from Avira, Avast Antivirus and Lookout (there are Android and iTunes versions of these apps).\n\nFeatured image credit: Virus via photopin (license)', 'Bitcoin has emerged as the leading cryptocurrency of choice ever since it came into being. In the eyes of the users of Bitcoin, the definition of it as a currency might just be very clear but when it comes to the legal definition of Bitcoin, there is still a lack of clarity.\n\nDoes the classification of Bitcoin matter?\n\nDifferent jurisdictions treat Bitcoin differently\n\nBitcoin is a true global currency and it can be used in any part of the world. In this type of a scenario, it is but natural that different legal jurisdictions take a different view of what exactly Bitcoin is. In some countries Bitcoin is not even deemed legal.\n\nIn some others Bitcoin is completely undefined, others yet see the status of Bitcoin in flux and some have completely given it a free hand. Then there is the matter of whether Bitcoin is money or a currency or both.\n\nThe curious case of Michell Espinoza\n\nOn February 6, 2014 Michell Espinoza was arrested in a sting operation. Espinoza stayed 3 months in Jail and was charged with selling $1500 worth of Bitcoin to detectives who claimed that he was illegally transmitting and laundering the money.\n\nIn July of 2016 a Miami-Dade judge ruled that Bitcoin is not actually money and all charges against Michell were thrown out.\n\nThe Miami Herald reported that Judge Teresa Mary Pooler in her ruling said:\n\n“The court is not an expert in economics; however, it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, the Bitcoin has a long way to go before it the equivalent of money.”\n\nThis judgement not only clarifies the status of Bitcoin in Florida but it will have wider implications as well, it also means that those people who were on the fence about using Bitcoin because of its status will be encouraged to use it.\n\nMichell Espinoza’s attorney Rene Palomino told the Miami Herald:\n\n“At least it gives the Bitcoin community some guidance that what my client did was not illegal, What he basically did was sell his own personal property. Michell Espinoza did not violate the law, plain and simple.”\n\nThe Bitcoin debate in the United States\n\nDifferent entities in the United States have treated Bitcoin differently. The SEC thinks of Bitcoin as a security or money. FinCEN (The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) treats Bitcoin as currency, while the IRS labels Bitcoin as property.\n\nInterestingly it was the IRS’ definition that Judge Pooler referenced in deciding the case Michell Espinoza. How the legal authorities ultimately classify digital assets like Bitcoin will definitely shape the future of the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe way cryptocurrencies will be taxed and used of course will depend on how they are viewed. Mass adoption also requires clarity on the part of the authorities to some extent.\n\nIn many countries the legal status of Bitcoin falls in the grey area and authorities have simply chosen to ignore the circulation of digital assets like Bitcoin because they do not see the volumes as of any significance.\n\nIn my home country of India for example while the central bank, The Reserve Bank of India is interested in exploring blockchain technology to fight against counterfeiting, they had previously in 2013 warned holders of virtual currencies in a 5 point press release.\n\nThe press release stated:\n\n“VCs being in digital form are stored in digital/electronic media that are called electronic wallets. Therefore, they are prone to losses arising out of hacking, loss of password, compromise of access credentials, malware attack etc. Since they are not created by or traded through any authorised central registry or agency, the loss of the e-wallet could result in the permanent loss of the VCs held in them.”\n\nOver time though the perception of the Indian central bank seems to have been changing.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nMaybe Bitcoin is what you want it to be. Different people see Bitcoin differently depending on how they utilise the cryptocurrency.\n\nIf you are paying for things in Bitcoin, you are using it as money. If you see it as a store of value that can beat inflation, you probably see it as an asset class similar to gold and so on.\n\nAs Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Input Output Hong Kong says:\n\n“I classify it as a digital commodity. It has a nice store of value property but makes a poor unit of account and somewhat ok means of exchange. Commodities like gold generally have this property.”\n\nOne thing is for sure, it may be rather difficult to arrive at a definite conclusion anytime soon and we can expect a debate surrounding how Bitcoin can be classified for years to come.']"
08/06/2016,"['The schadenfreude of Bitcoin enthusiasts over Ethereum’s recent troubles ended abruptly last week. A major Bitcoin exchange, Bitfinex, was hacked and nearly 120,000 BTC (around $60m) was stolen. The price of Bitcoin promptly crashed, and Bitfinex was forced to suspend trading. Suddenly, Ethereum was not the only basket case cryptocurrency around.\n\nIt appears that Bitfinex’s security was seriously compromised. Customer coins were held in individual wallets secured with a 2 of 3 multisig arrangement: keys were held by Bitfinex itself and Bitgo, a professional custodian and signatory, with a third (backup) key held in secure offline storage. Customers could not withdraw funds from the wallets until any borrowings had been cleared. It was, if you like, a form of escrow. And it should have been secure.\n\nBut it wasn’t. Somehow, the hacker managed to gain access to hundreds of customer wallets. Not only did the hacker gain access to the wallets, he/she also overrode Bitgo’s withdrawal limits. It was a well-planned and comprehensive security breach by someone who knew exactly what they were doing. Funds were moved to thousands of addresses over a short period of time. Bitfinex, it seems, was powerless to stop it.\n\nThis is one of the largest Bitcoin heists ever, dwarfed only by Mt. Gox in 2014. It is comparable in size to Ethereum’s DAO theft only a couple of weeks ago. And it is going to result in a lot of people losing a lot of money. All of Bitfinex’s customers, in fact. The company has announced a haircut of 36.067% across the board:\n\nAfter much thought, analysis, and consultation, we have arrived at the conclusion that losses must be generalized across all accounts and assets. This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context. Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067%. In a later announcement we will explain in full detail the methodology used to compute these losses.\n\nAlthough the loss is estimated as the amount the customers would receive if the company were liquidated, this is a bail-in. Bitfinex has no plans to cease trading:\n\nWe intend to come online within 24-48 hours with limited platform functionality. Additional announcements will be made as we progressively enable more platform features and return to full operations.\n\nIt’s not at all clear what the legal basis for this bail-in is. There will no doubt be court cases to establish it. Though Bitfinex seems to be hoping for some gullible investors to make good the losses:\n\nWe are actively discussing various strategic options with numerous potential investors as part of our strategy to fully compensate our customers. Such discussions, however, are in early stages and will likely take time to play out.\n\nA very long time, I should think.\n\nSo how did this happen – and who was responsible? Unsurprisingly, Bitfinex blamed everyone except itself. Color me unconvinced. I may be wrong, but I think this theft was most likely planned and executed by someone within Bitfinex, using the CFTC’s recent investigation into Bitfinex’s margin trading activities as cover.\n\nIn June, Bitfinex was issued with a cease-and-desist order by the CFTC for breaking the Commodities Act by executing illegal off-exchange margin trading deals and failing to register as a futures commission merchant. In its judgment, the CFTC notes that during the investigation, Bitfinex twice changed its procedures for storing customer money:\n\nFrom April 2013 to August 2015, when a customer purchased bitcoins on Bitfinex, the purchased bitcoins were held for the benefit of the buyer in Bitfinex\' s omnibus settlement wallet. The individual customer interests in the omnibus settlement wallet were accounted for in real time on Bitfinex\'s database. However, the omnibus settlement wallet was owned and controlled by Bitfinex and Bitfinex held all ""private keys"" associated with its omnibus settlement wallet..... In August 2015, Bitfinex changed its model so that bitcoins purchased using the Exchange Trading feature were held in multi-signature wallets established by a third party firm that were individually enumerated for each trader. Bitcoins purchased using the Exchange Trading feature were settled to the Blockchain on an intra-day basis. However, Bitfinex retained control over the private keys to these wallets as well. In January 2016 and for the remainder of the Relevant Period, during the course of the Division of Enforcement\'s investigation, Bitfinex changed its model again so that bitcoins purchased using both the Exchange Trading and Margin Trading features were held in individually enumerated, multi-signature wallets. However, Bitfinex continued to retain control over the private keys to those wallets.\n\nIt has been alleged that the CFTC forced Bitfinex to change its storage arrangements, introducing a weakness into the system which the hacker could exploit. Keeping customer money in individual multi-signature wallets in the custody of a neutral third party is apparently not as safe as keeping it offline in a very large bucket with a single set of keys.', 'Bitcoin, a Florida judge says, is not real money. Ironically, that could provide a boost to use of the crypto-currency which has remained in the shadows of the financial system.\n\nThe July 22 ruling by Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Pooler means that no specific license is needed to buy and sell bitcoins.\n\nThe judge dismissed a case against Michel Espinoza, who had faced money laundering and other criminal charges for attempting to sell $1,500 worth of bitcoins to an undercover agent who told the defendant he was going to use the virtual money to buy stolen credit card numbers.\n\nEspinoza\'s lawyer Rene Palomino said the judge acknowledged that it was not illegal to sell one\'s property and ruled that this did not constitute running an unauthorized financial service.\n\n""He was selling his own personal bitcoins,"" Palomino said. ""This decision clears the way for you to do that in the state of the Florida without a money transmitting license.""\n\nIn her ruling, Pooler said, ""this court is unwilling to punish a man for selling his property to another, when his actions fall under a statute that is so vaguely written that even legal professionals have difficulty finding a singular meaning.""\n\nShe added that ""this court is not an expert in economics,"" but that bitcoin ""has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money.""\n\nBitcoin, whose origins remain a mystery, is a virtual currency that is created from computer code and is not backed by any government. Advocates say this makes it an efficient alternative to traditional currencies because it is not subject to the whims of a state that may devalue its money to cut its debt, for example.\n\nBitcoins can be exchanged for goods and services, provided another party is willing to accept them, but until now they been used mostly for shady transactions or to buy illegal goods and services on the ""dark"" web.\n\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 as a bit of software written under the Japanese-sounding name Satoshi Nakamoto. This year Australian programmer Craig Wright claimed to be the author but failed to convince the broader bitcoin community.\n\nIn some areas of the United States bitcoin is accepted in stores, restaurants and online transactions, but it is illegal in some countries, notably France and China.\n\nIt is gaining ground in countries with high inflation such as Argentina and Venezuela.\n\nBut bitcoin values can be volatile. Over the past week its value slumped 20 percent in a day, then recouped most losses, after news that a Hong Kong bitcoin exchange had been hacked with some $65 million missing.\n\nImpact across US, world\n\nArthur Long, a lawyer specializing in the sector with the New York firm Gibson Dunn, said the July court ruling is a small victory for the virtual currency but that it\'s not clear if the interpretation will be the same in other US states or at the federal level.\n\n""It may have an effect as some states are trying to use existing money transmitting statutes to regulate certain transactions in bitcoin,"" Long told AFP.\n\nCharles Evans, professor of finance at Barry University, said the ruling ""absolutely is going to provide some guidance in other courts"" and could potentially be used as a precedent in other countries to avoid the stigma associated with bitcoin use.\n\nBitcoins can store value and hedge against inflation, without being considered a monetary unit, according to Evans, who testified as an expert witness in the Florida trial.\n\n""It can be used as an exchange,"" he said, and may be considered a commodity which can be used for bartering like fish or tobacco, for example.\n\nEvans noted that ""those who are not yet in the bitcoin community will be put on notice: as long as they organize their business in a particular way they can avoid the law.""\n\nBut he added that ""people who are engaged in illegal activities will continue to do what they are going to do because they are criminals.""\n\nExplore further: Factbox: What is Bitcoin?', 'Once heralded as the ""silver to bitcoin\'s gold"", the developers behind the long-running digital currency litecoin are seeking to reestablish the project\'s prior position as the world\'s second most popular cryptocurrency.\n\nBreaking a long lull in project announcements, litecoin’s core developers and the Litecoin Association, a Texas-based non-profit advocacy group for the technology, revealed a new roadmap earlier this summer. Far from a dramatic change in course, it seeks to reinvigorate a project originally launched as an online payment option meant to be faster and more enticing for global merchants.\n\nBut despite early success as a complement to bitcoin for investors and traders, the project has arguably fallen behind as the blockchain technology underlying bitcoin has increasingly become the focus of institutions and former bitcoin startups.\n\nHowever, the team behind the project used the announcement to double down on its prior market positioning, introducing a number of updates that sought to showcase it is focused on transaction speed, scaling, merchant support and mobile wallets.\n\nWith the project unencumbered by the byzantine nature of bitcoin\'s mammoth governance structure, some in the community believe it could come to implement changes quicker than the world\'s most popular digital currency, thus giving it a key competitive advantage.\n\nCompetition emerges\n\nStill, the roadmap release comes at a time that could viewed as a defining moment for litecoin, one that in many ways finds it grappling with changes in how digital currencies are being perceived amid heightened institutional interest.\n\nAt a time when many in the industry are eager for technological innovation, litecoin’s success has historically been the strength of its market capitalization, and its perception as a useful hedge for investors who wanted relief from the sometimes more volatile bitcoin network.\n\nFor example, litecoin is one of only a handful of digital currency networks to reach a market cap of $225m, and it has historically held a number-two position ahead of many hundreds of competing alternatives.\n\n\n\nIn some ways, litecoin could be viewed as having a similar hold on its position as bitcoin. Even as litecoin\'s market cap and price dropped from its lofty heights in late 2013, it has still consistently led the rest of the pack.\n\nHowever, the arrival of the blockchain network ethereum, and its token, ether, has called this value proposition into question.\n\nLauded for innovations in blockchain technology including smart contracts and praised by an increasing number of financial incumbents, the value of ethereum’s native token, ether, has not only surpassed litecoin’s current value, but also its 2013 peak.\n\nKey to ethereum’s success has been that it has a unique value proposition in that it’s primary use is not as a digital currency, but as a resource meant for powering blockchain-based decentralized applications on its network.\n\nTaking on ethereum\n\nBut, price isn’t everything, and faster is not always better.\n\nBeing ""silver to bitcoin\'s gold"" may be less than exciting sales pitch in today\'s environment, where bombastic proclamations of world-changing tech are the norm, but it points to the reliability that has long centered the project.\n\nIn many ways, the failure of The DAO and the ethereum fork have vindicated litecoin\'s steady approach, even as interest in ethereum continues to rise. Further, litecoin has so far resisted the temptation to announce any game-changing features that would find it following in that ethereum\'s footsteps, despite pressures to do so.\n\n""Litecoin is trying to do something different than ethereum,"" litecoin founder Charlie Lee told CoinDesk.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Its focus is as a payment method alongside bitcoin. That is not to say assets and other features could come along eventually, just like they may for bitcoin, but we won’t sacrifice security or usability for it.""\n\nInstead, its contributors have been quietly fixing bugs, implementing preventative spam transaction measures and hoping that if bitcoin\'s blocks become full, it can catch some of that overflow and ride it to a new golden era for the project.\n\nAndrew Vegetabile, board member of the Litecoin Association, attested to this steady approach and unity of vision.\n\n""For litecoin, the core developers along with the Litecoin Association, have always pushed for an alternate payment method to fiat as litecoin\'s main focus,"" he said.\n\nVegetabile told CoinDesk:\n\n""Sure, we can add additional functionality on layers on top of Litecoin Core, but the primary focus is payment method and providing a solid foundation for additional applications.""\n\nLitecoin as a complement\n\nLitecoin\'s goal isn’t to replace bitcoin, but to find niches that it excels at and take advantage of those to carve out new market space.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin is accepted by more merchants, but there are scenarios where litecoin\'s enthusiasts believe it could emerge as the leader. For example, some enthusiasts believe bitcoin\'s long-simmering block size debate could reduce the currency\'s speed, making litecoin more useful.\n\n""If bitcoin were to limit blocks and the chains become so crippled with unprocessed transactions,"" explained Vegetabile, ""then it\'s certainly a possibility we will see an explosion of usage of litecoin.""\n\nStill, others see this scenario as far-fetched.\n\nJim Harper, a fellow at the CATO institute and former member of the Bitcoin Foundation board, believes that bitcoin is perhaps too big to fail, and that any issues with the larger, more well-known network wouldn’t benefit litecoin.\n\nHarper told CoinDesk:\n\n""If bitcoin appears broken, I think ordinary people will assume that digital currency is broken. Consumers probably won’t make the subtle judgments among digital currencies that we in the community can.""\n\nThe key, according to Lee, isn\'t bitcoin failing but simply being different.\n\nLee argues that a faster blockchain could make litecoin more competitive, as should bitcoin chose not to increase its block size, transactions could become slower and more costly.\n\nThe solution, according to Lee, could be that multiple cryptocurrency networks simply evolve to serve these different needs.\n\n""If you are buying a house, you probably want to use the most secure system, regardless of fees. But if you are buying a coffee, you probably don’t want additional fees, and you want it to settle quickly,"" he said, adding:\n\n""In that case, speed and usability may be more important than the network’s total hashing power.""\n\nCo-dependent future\n\nIn some ways, litecoin\'s future is, like its tagline, dependent on bitcoin.\n\nAs such, there is less of a competition between the two projects than a realization, at least in the litecoin community, that a rising tide could lift all boats.\n\nAs different blockchain protocols vie for market position, litecoin’s best bet may be to wait it out and see which niches open up. After all, it remains unclear exactly how bitcoin will be used, and it if it will support other blockchains through innovations like sidechains.\n\nToday, both are aiming to serve as payment rails and currencies, but they are also well suited to pivot elsewhere if the opportunity presents itself.\n\nIn this way, it’s not hard to foresee a certain blockchain handling remittance, another consumer spending and still others facilitating roles in other niches.\n\nAn argument can be made that alternative protocols are all waiting to see which niche bitcoin leaves open.\n\nVegetable concluded:\n\n""I personally believe that litecoin\'s best chance of success is for bitcoin to succeed.""\n\nStrawberries image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The company primarily lists non-owner occupied residential projects lasting 12 to 24 months, as well as small to mid-size apartment and commercial property ventures.\n\n- Brelion\n\nThe website currently lists 32 properties, four are accepting investments, although Brelion only serves accredited investors. According to the SEC, “accredited investors” (i) earn at least $200,000 per year, or $300,000 per year with their spouse; or (ii) have a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding principal residence.”\n\nBrelion projects typically fall into two investing categories, debt financing or equity financing. For debt projects, investors receive interest payments from real estate companies each month after a project is funded. The principle paid when a project is completed and the company exits. For equity projects, investors receive a percentage of the profits that the project ultimately yields.\n\n- Brelion\n\nThe Ohio-based company recently started a pilot project, “driven purely by our love for innovations,” claims founder and CEO Vadim Kleyner. His website now hosts a Bitcoin digital currency real estate investment option; a four bedroom suburban residence.\n\nThe 12 month project will involve renovating the property, and then refinancing to return equity to investors. The property was purchased for approximately 30.83 XBT, renovations are expected to cost an estimated 65.49 XBT. The project manager expects the property to appraise for approximately 120.21 XBT on completion.\n\n- Brelion\n\nThe company’s website follows the crowdfunding format popularized by Kickstarter and Indiegogo, but offers investments on property projects. The site claims to be highly secure, with “several layers of advanced software security and data encryption protocols, including SSL 256 bit certificate, hosted in Microsoft Azure Cloud.” The website also claims to offer some of the IT industry’s “most cutting-edge security features.”\n\nThe business model was made legal last year, when the SEC announced new rules allowing equity crowdfunding. One of the first operational equity crowdfunding platforms in the USA was EquityNet, and other early platforms include CrowdCube and Seedrs in the UK. Kleyner points out that his business also falls under the Exchange Act Rule 3a4–1, which other fundraising platforms use to legally skip registering as a broker.\n\nBraveNewCoin spoke with Kleyner about the pilot project. According to the Brelion site, Kleyner has more than 20 years of IT experience and a decade of real estate experience. The new Bitcoin pilot is a “proof of concept,” the CEO told us. “We are setting up systems and processes, policies and procedures of accepting Cryptocurrency globally [...] As well as evaluating the interest.”\n\n- Brelion Pilot Announcement\n\nThe minimum investment is 5 bitcoin, which Kleyner says he protects in a multi-step, secure process that requires an AML/KYC check. “Until project is fully funded BitCoins are being held in the wallet with multisig security,” he explained.\n\nHowever, the company lists no insurance plan in case they are hacked or otherwise disappear. “There is no insurance or option play to protect Brelion as essentially it is Brelion who will be losing out if price of bitcoin goes up,” explained Kleyner. “Brelion will insure investors against BitCoin fluctuation, but not against sponsors performance.”\n\nIf and when the project is fully funded, Brelion will convert the bitcoins to fiat, and pass them on to the project manager. The 13% annualized return will be paid in fiat, minus the platforms 1% fee. Brelion will then exchange it for bitcoins and distribute it to investors.\n\n- Brelion\n\nAlthough Brelion may have been the first to offer investments in their niche through bitcoin, real estate has been available through sites like BitPremier for some time. The company is headed by Alan Silbert, brother of Digital Currency Group Founder & CEO, Barry Silbert.\n\nOther bitcoin investment platforms with track records, such as BTCJam and BitBond, offer various types of loans. They also provide an auto-invest feature to make diversification easier.', 'William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"", and a board advisor to the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that oversees the development of one of two blockchains seeking to popularize the software.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Mougayar offers his thoughts on the how blockchains and digital currency could change the way we work and how we are compensated.\n\n\n\nWe are in the early stages of a new chapter in the nature of work. The blockchain will enable us to do our jobs and be compensated inside new circular economies that have their own currency units and their own work units.\n\nThis, I believe, is one of the greatest themes to emerge from blockchain technology.\n\nMost work today is compensated via bilateral agreements between a worker and an employer according to a simple contract: you work in X job, and we will compensate you in Y currency.\n\nBut what if we had greater autonomy over how we choose our own work? With more control, we would then be able to perform new types of tasks that may or may not resemble what is traditionally considered labor, and earn cryptocurrency instead of fiat currency.\n\nAs a result, instead of doing one job we could hold several paying jobs that are diversified, while not being tied down by the constraints of a single employer.\n\nAlready, a number of blockchain based businesses are compensating users for their \'work\' via digital tokens.\n\nSteemit for example, rewards users who vote-up or write posts on its decentralized content platform.\n\nThe theory of decentralized transportation platform La’Zooz is that you earn Zooz points, just by driving your car while the app collects data about your driving patterns.\n\nA healthcare research entity could pay patients or normal people who share their medical data, in exchange for the collective wisdom that is gained by aggregating that information, and returning personalized or comparative insights.\n\nAt the heart of making this possible, is the relationship between actual work done, value created, and value received.\n\nLet us dissect what is happening here:\n\nUsers perform some work, either passive (driving and sharing data), or active (voting a post, or making a decision). Each marketplace has its own \'unit of work\', consisting of a variety of activities. Each unit of work generates value for the marketplace, for other users and for the end-user themselves. This is an expansion of the network effect theory where each user’s actions benefits other users. In return for that value, users are rewarded with a native token currency, the marketplace’s own currency. That currency can be spent inside the marketplace on another transaction or service (eg taking a ride, promoting content), or it can be exchanged outside the marketplace against another cryptocurrency or fiat money. The value of the marketplace as a whole increases proportionally with the amount of activity and value that are generated inside of it.\n\nA new system of work\n\nThere is a new system of work that is unfolding, and blockchains are enabling it.\n\nThis is not a Ponzi scheme, but rather a new way to generate economic value. Of course, some companies will try to abuse this system, but others that have thought carefully about its mechanics and operations will benefit and enable their users to also partake in their success via the sharing of network equity.\n\nThe most important elements that have to be done right are:\n\nthe work being done must be varied work being done must be valuable and valued users should be able to spend their earned currency internally in order to generate more value.\n\nWhat is happening here is the creation of mini circular economies that are self-contained. Some of these models will be created by new companies, while others will be spun out of existing companies.\n\nThe models coming out of existing companies will be interesting to watch because most companies and their users create an excess of value that is not well captured. Linking the critical elements together as depicted in my diagram would give a new life to a new economic model.\n\nCould this be the future of work and wealth creation? Possibly.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Mougayar\'s blog, Startup Management, and has been republished here with his permission.\n\nImage of gears via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Nowe szczegóły w sprawie włamania na giełdę Bitfinex\n\nPierwsza fala emocji po włamaniu na giełdę BitFinex opadła. Kurs BTC po ostrym nurkowaniu nieco odbił i ustabilizował się. Giełda straciła prawie 120 000 BTC, co według nieoficjalnych szacunków stanowiło około 70% jej aktywów. Teraz nadeszła pora na postawienie dwóch zasadniczych pytań: jak do tego doszło i co dalej z giełdą i funduszami jej użytkowników?\n\n\n\nZacznijmy od pierwszej kwestii. Cała sprawa zaczęła się w momencie, gdy BitFinex usiłował sprostać amerykańskim wymaganiom prawnym. Zdecydowana większość giełd zasadniczą część funduszy trzyma w zimnym portfelu –nie połączonym z siecią. Nawet, gdy haker opanuje system giełdy, zimny portfel pozostaje poza jego zasięgiem. Jednakże środki umieszczone w zimnym portfelu w sposób oczywisty są kontrolowane przez giełdę, natomiast nie są kontrolowane przez jej klientów.\n\nTo z kolei zmienia kwalifikację giełdy w amerykańskim prawie finansowym. Co w tej sytuacji zrobił BitFinex? Otóż... postanowił pozbyć się zimnego portfela. W zamian środki w gorącym portfelu były zabezpieczone techniką wielu kluczy (multisig) przy współpracy z firmą BitGo.\n\n\n\nKonfiguracja systemu BitFinexa była następująca: jeden klucz był kluczem roboczym giełdy, drugi był w BitGo, trzeci był kopią zapasową. Transakcje podpisywały dwa z trzech kluczy. Transakcje wygenerowane przez BitFinexa i podpisane pierwszym kluczem były wysyłane do BitGo do podpisania. Dwukrotnie podpisane transakcje były następnie rozgłaszane przez węzeł BitFinexa do sieci Bitcoin. W ten sposób klucz BitGo nie opuszczał serwerów firmy i jak twierdzą jej przedstawiciele, serwery te nie zostały naruszone.\n\nZauważmy, że konieczność podpisania każdej wychodzącej z BitFinexa transakcji umożliwiała BitGo ich monitorowanie. Jak to więc możliwe, że wypłata 120 000 BTC przeszła niezauważona? Prawdopodobną hipotezą jest założenie, że złodziej uzyskał dostęp do API jakie BitFinexowi pozwalało na kontrolowanie ich konta w BitGo i zmienił limity. Inne podejrzenie sugeruje, że BitFinex sam naciskał BitGo na zniesienie limitów dla „ułatwienia” sobie pracy. To co się udało ustalić na podstawie blockchaina, to fakt, że transakcje złodzieja były prawidłowo podpisane roboczym kluczem giełdy i kluczem BitGo, więc nie uzyskał dostępu do klucza zapasowego.\n\n\n\nPrzy okazji reakcji firmy BitGo na całe wydarzenie warto zauważyć ""śliską"" kwestię rzekomego ubezpieczenia środków zgromadzonych na BitFinexie, a zabezpieczanych przez BitGo. Był to argument wykorzystywany przez BitFinex do reklamy swoich usług. Zakładając konto na giełdzie użytkownik jednocześnie zakładał konto w BitGo i był objęty regulaminami obu usług. Stwarzało to wrażenie, że BitGo ubezpiecza środki każdego użytkownika z osobna. Po kradzieży BitGo szybko usunęło ze swojej strony informację o ubezpieczeniu środków, po czym ją przywróciło z dodaną wstecznie informacją, że ubezpieczenie przestało obowiązywać w styczniu 2016.\n\nRzekomo poinformowano o tym wszystkich klientów, ale najwidoczniej w tym przypadku użytkownicy BitFinexa nie byli traktowani jako indywidualni klienci BitGo. Można się domyślać, że BitGo rozpoczyna krycie tyłów w obawie przed ewentualnymi procesami sądowymi.\n\n\n\nTeorii tłumaczących włamanie jest oczywiście wiele. Jedna z nich zwraca uwagę na minusy korzystania przez giełdy z usług CloudFlare chroniących przed atakami DDoS. Wewnątrz CloudFlare cały ruch sieciowy między klientami a giełdą jest rozszyfrowany i pracownicy firmy mogą wykonać bez trudu dowolny praktycznie atak na tę komunikację. Krytycy tej teorii argumentują, że ruch między BitFinexem a BitGo raczej nie przechodzi przez CloudFlare.\n\n\n\nCo ciekawe złodziej systematycznie przesuwał bitcoiny z adresów użytkowników nie na jeden zbiorczy adres, ale suma skradziona każdemu użytkownikowi była przelewana na adres oddzielny. Środki póki co pozostają na tych drugich adresach. Zdaniem niektórych takie zachowanie może świadczyć o tym, że mamy do czynienia z „insider job”, albo wręcz cała kradzież została sfingowana przez BitFinex. Inni z kolei sugerują, że te środki są właśnie przepuszczane przez jakiś anonimizujący mikser lub zostaną „wkręcone” do miksera później.\n\n\n\nCo zrobi teraz giełda? Na razie wyłączono handel i przystąpiono do zamknięcia otwartych pozycji z dźwignią. Mają one zostać zamknięte według kursów z momentu wyłączenia handlu. Rozliczone mają też być swapy (pożyczki udzielane przez użytkowników giełdy innym użytkownikom otwierającym pozycje z dźwignią). Po zakończeniu tego procesu giełda będzie dokładnie wiedziała ile komu ma oddać. Ale czy będzie miała z czego? Wnosząc po wpisie na blogu prawdopodobnie nie będzie miała.\n\nMożna się więc spodziewać rozłożenia strat na wszystkich użytkowników posiadających depozyty w BTC. Pojawiła się też propozycja spłacenia należności udziałami w giełdzie, a nawet wypuszczenia własnej kryptowaluty, która byłaby nośnikiem długu giełdy wobec użytkowników, umożliwiłoby to obracanie tymże długiem.\n\n\n\nNiestety na poszkodowanych we włamaniu próbują żerować kolejni przestępcy, którzy uruchomili kampanię phishingową. Rozsyłając maile z podobnej domeny „ibitfinex.com” usiłują wyłudzić dane logowania użytkowników na ich konta na giełdzie. Osoby mające konta na BitFinexie powinny być teraz podwójnie ostrożne i podejrzliwie sprawdzać każdy mail.\n\n\n\nSposób w jaki BitFinex pokryje (lub nie) straty użytkownikom może być istotny dla kursu. Mamy do czynienia z największym włamaniem na giełdę od czasów afery MtGox, o ile tamtą aferę można nazwać włamaniem. W przypadku mniejszych kradzieży (BitStamp, czy samBitFinex) giełdy pokrywały straty z własnych funduszy. Teraz jednak skala kradzieży prawdopodobnie przekracza możliwości BitFinexa jednak dużo może zależeć od planu naprawczego. Konkretne decyzje giełda ma ogłosić prawdopodobnie jeszcze dziś. Informację będziemy aktualizować na bieżąco pod tym artykułem.\n\n[aktualizacja - 06.08.2016 18:30]\n\nGiełda Bitfinex ogłosiła przed chwilą, że straty po włamaniu zostaną rozłożone na wszystkich użytkowników. Jako, że na giełdzie były nie tylko bitcoiny, ale również inne krytpowaluty i waluty fiat, stan kont wszystkich użytkowników na giełdzie pomniejszy się o 36%. Dodatkowo każdy w miejsce brakujących środków dostanie żetony BFX, które może zamienić np. na akcje firmy lub poczekać na wymianę środków w przypadku, gdy giełda ""stanie na nogi"" lub znajdzie inwestorów.\n\nBitfinex zapowiedział wznowienie działania w ciągu 24/48 godzin.', 'DECENT is a new decentralized content distribution platform that is open source and utilizes blockchain technology, ensuring trust and security.

Bitcoin continues to be a more secure payments option. Read more...\n\nThe ongoing competition between fiat based electronic payments and digital currency payments doesn’t have a winner yet. The credit and debit card based electronic payments systems score over Bitcoin payments when it comes to number of users and the rate at which transactions are processed. However, Bitcoin continues to lead the way in the security department.\n\nCredit Card frauds have hit an all-time high across the world. In last year alone, total damages of over $16 billion was caused by fraudulent credit card transactions. The instances of credit and debit card frauds saw an 18 percent increase in the UK last year. Similarly, a recent study conducted in Singapore showed that at least one out of three Singaporeans have been victims of electronic payment instrument related fraud. People become targets to hackers and cyber criminals who use various methods to gain access to an individual’s personal information, including full name, credit card number, CVV etc. and use it to make fraudulent transactions.\n\nThey employ numerous methods to gain private information. It may be a cashier who secretly copies the information when someone pays with their credit card or a hacker breaking into victim’s online accounts or a caller posing as a bank representative convincing the victim to divulge their card details and more. Another method employed by tech savvy thieves is skimming. The credit or debit card data is recorded by swiping the card on a skimmer, which is then used to create duplicate cards for use. However, the banks and payment companies started combating this type of fraud by including EMV chips on debit and credit cards. The EMV chip was expected to offer an additional layer of security for PoS transactions.\n\nThe PoS machines cross verify the data on EMV chip with that of the magnetic strip before authorizing transactions. Also, it is much harder to duplicate an EMV chip than magnetic strip as the EMV chips generate cryptograms for each transaction, to be read and verified by the machine. However, recent reports state that even the cards with EMV chips are not safe anymore. In a recent Black Hat computer security conference, security researchers from NCR have demonstrated that EMV chips can be easily counterfeited. just like their magnetic strip only counterparts.\n\nIt is found that the data on magnetic strip can be altered to make the PoS machines think that the card doesn’t have an EMV chip. Thus, allowing cybercriminals and fraudsters to duplicate EMV chip cards on regular magnetic strip based cards. Making matters worse in the absence of end-to-end encryption features on many PoS terminals.\n\nAs the fiat based banking industry continues to struggle with security problems, the bitcoin-based payment services offer a much simpler and secure option. In order to gain access to a customer’s bitcoin wallet, one has to either physically access the device and enter the right PIN to authorize transactions or have access to the wallet’s private key. In addition, users also have the option to use any wallet and change the wallet at any time they want, without having to go through a long process like in the case of debit and credit cards.\n\nWhile Bitcoin continues to be the most secure option out there, the current transaction processing capacity of Bitcoin blockchain and slow rate of adoption has prevented it so far from becoming the mainstream payments option.\n\nRef: CNN | Business Insider |Image: NewsBTC', 'Bitcoin price is gradually approaching $600 (Bitstamp) as the chart’s momentum indicators show ongoing compensation for last week’s strong sell-off.

The exchange will allow customers to access their diminished funds and brand new tradeable asset, BFXcoin, in controlled stages:\n\nStage 1: Read-only (look but don’t touch)\n\nStage 2: Withdrawals enabled (ok, touch)\n\nStage 3: Trading enabled (small print: trade and exchange wallets can lead to loss)\n\nThe 1-day chart, above, shows bitcoin price action for the past three years.\n\nWhilst there are several confirmations that remain outstanding before we can be confident about advance, notice the chart structures at last week’s low. Price had fallen onto support of both the 1-day 200MA (red) and the horizontal support (blue) of what used to be a resistance ceiling for most of the first half of 2016.\n\nThe bounce from the low is impressive, yet, even if it continues higher, it must eventually overcome the obstacle of multi-year resistance at $680 (grey horizontal line). RSI seems to have made a decisive low (magenta circle), and smart traders should wait for the 1-day MACD (second from top) indicator line to cross above zero before considering a long position.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price advances cautiously after a bounce from $465 (Bitstamp). To the upside is resistance at $680 and to the downside the strong support at the recent low of $465. The immediate level that the market is eyeing appears to be $600, and depending on whether this level is won or lost, traders can consider their directional bets.

When they can\'t, miners have two options – they can begin mining another cryptocurrency or shut down their equipment for good.\n\nFor some miners, the recent bitcoin halving forced this very choice.\n\nEarly this summer, the amount of bitcoins the network was programmed to pay out per block was cut in half, falling from 25 to 12.5 BTC. In a matter of minutes, bitcoin mining became less profitable.\n\nBut, rather than abandon their machinery and their efforts, a notable minority elected to begin mining a cryptocurrency called peercoin.\n\nWhile there were other options that could have been considered, there were some reasons for the specific choice. Launched in 2012, peercoin is among the more tenured cryptocurrencies, and it uses a similar hash function as bitcoin.\n\nAfter all, for miners to liquidate the cryptocurrencies that they mine, there needs to be a market, and in order to mine those coins, their equipment needs to be compatible with the network.\n\nPeercoin, which also uses the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function, and sees $100,000 in daily volume, fits this need.\n\nResearcher Adam Hayes explained that the peercoin network hashrate surged from roughly 500 terahashes per second (TH/s) to 6,500 TH/s following the halving, and that this was the most notable of the increases he observed.\n\nHayes even went so far as to personally participate in this increase as a hobby miner looking to optimize his performance.\n\nFor a short time, Hayes said he was able to use his Antminer S9 to increase his leverage, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""It was marginally more profitable by about 200%.""\n\nWhy the boost?\n\nThe new economic edge for miners was created by peercoin’s approach to mining. Unlike bitcoin, which uses a process called proof-of-work (PoW) to secure the network, peercoin is a hybrid cryptocurrency that also utilizes proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nIn a PoS model, those who own peercoin are the ones that verify transactions on the network. The more peercoin you hold, the more important your verification is for the network.\n\nThe argument is that this incentivizes users to save their peercoin rather than spend it.\n\nHowever, there is still a network of miners whose responsibility is to create new peercoins for circulation in the network. Unlike bitcoin, which has a predictable release schedule, peercoin\'s is more fluid, releasing its coins at a rate that\'s dependent on the difficulty of the network.\n\nThis means the more difficult it is to mine, the fewer rewards offered by the network.\n\nFor example, on 18th June, peercoin\'s difficulty was approximately 303.49 million, which resulted in a 75.77 PPC block reward. Fast forward to 10th July, the day after halving, and the difficulty had spiked to 570 million, which cut the block reward to 64.8 PPC.\n\nSymbiotic relationship\n\nFor a short window, it seems the economics were right to encourage a migration from bitcoin to peercoin. However, due to the network\'s unique rules, this benefit appears to have been short-lived.\n\nThe next day, peercoin\'s difficulty spiked to over 700 million, which made it less profitable than bitcoin mining.\n\nBecause of the relationship between the two networks, some miners make a routine of switching between the networks.\n\nKyle Sidles, a miner in Washington State, explained that his operation is set up to do just that in an attempt to maximize margins.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Immediately after the halving, the profitability for mining peercoin was nearly that of bitcoin. That did not last long as many bitcoin miners noticed this and started diverting hashing power to peercoin.""\n\nAccording to his analysis, peercoin is only profitable if the difficulty is less than approximately 650 million. If the difficulty is higher, he explained, bitcoin is more profitable.\n\nPeercoin\'s value proposition\n\nOf course, you may be wondering what gives peercoins value at all.\n\nFor now, peercoin is a small cryptocurrency with an $8m market capitalization and a small band of loyal developers.\n\nAt its core, peercoin is meant to be a decentralized store of value currency, those involved with its development say.\n\nRandy Vittorini, the community manager of PeercoinTalk, summed up the goal of peercoin in an email, stating:\n\n“Peercoin was intentionally designed to fulfill the role of backbone currency, rather than transactional currency.""\n\nHis argument is that the sole focus of peercoin is to stay decentralized, and that this provides protection for user wealth.\n\nTo stay decentralized, tiny transactions have to be prevented from occurring on the main peercoin blockchain. (To achieve this, the protocol charges a flat 0.01 ppc/kb fee for transactions, an amount that is deducted from supply).\n\nDue to how expensive this is, it keeps spam from flooding the chain, thus allowing the blockchain to stay small data-wise. It\'s easier for a small chain to be decentralized than a large one.\n\nThe relationship lives on\n\nWhile much of the newly arrived hashing power ultimately left peercoin to return to bitcoin, the relationship between the two can continue for as long as miners are trying to eek every last penny out of their hardware.\n\nWith the ease of switching between SHA-256 coins, if bitcoin mining is unprofitable, miners will switch to others.\n\nThough, this relationship is entirely opportunistic for miners with little benefit to peercoin. With miners likely selling their peercoin immediately after they earn it, peercoin doesn\'t increase its security by adding new long-term holders.\n\nUltimately, this arguably turns into a parasitic relationship. This time, it\'s peercoin that saw the hash jump. Next time, it might be an entirely different altcoin.\n\nWith ASICs only able to mine one cryptogaphic hash function, any coin that utilizes SHA-256 and has enough liquidity for miners to get out could see similar spikes.\n\nRabbit image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A lesson for Bitcoin? — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) August 6, 2016\n\nEthereum fork meant to isolate stolen funds\n\nFollowing a hack of the DAO involving the theft of millions of Ether, the Ethereum community decided a hard fork was in the best interests of the cryptocurrency. The resulting fork split the currency into ETH and ETC.\n\nAgainst expectation, however, the value of ETC has tripled over two weeks to a market cap of over $200 million, displacing Litecoin to become the fifth most valuable cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nETH, meanwhile, dropped from its peak of about $1.75 billion pre-hack to around $900 million now, a number which has remained relatively stagnant since the fork.\n\nAdditionally, ETC has gained support by several large exchanges, adding to speculation that it could one day overtake ETH.\n\nThe cryptocurrency field continues to diversify\n\nEthereum’s split into two continues the grand trend of cryptocurrency’s ongoing diversification. While Bitcoin’s market cap experienced its highest point in late 2013, this year was the all-time high for combined altcoin value. Bitcoin’s share of cryptocurrency’s total value is on a consistent downward trend, recently dropping once more below 80%.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency continues to grow, the degree to which it relies on the larger, more established players continues to shrink.', 'A machine learning algorithm has found zero-day exploits available for as less as $10000 on the dark net. Read more...\n\nBitcoin is the most used currency on the dark net. Dark net marketplaces continue to be one of the attractive places to procure illegal drugs and contraband. In addition to the usual fare, one can also buy zero-day exploits for the right price.\n\nAs the use of technology continues to expand, the number of cyberthreats are also on the rise. According to a leading science and technology magazine, one can find over 300 cyberthreats on the dark net every week. While it is not easy for a person to manually visit all the hacker forums and marketplaces across the internet and find these threats, a machine learning algorithm run by a computer can do it in a jiffy.\n\nZero-day exploits are malicious codes that take advantage of undetected software flaws before it becomes known to the developers and security experts. These zero-day exploits are deployed before the developers patch the vulnerability. Many times, these zero-day exploits go undetected for days or even months.\n\nWhen a cybercriminal or a hacker comes across a zero-day vulnerability in any software, he/she will rather find ways to exploit it than report the flaw to developers. These zero-day exploits thus developed are sold on the dark net. Anyone interested in stealing money or data from computers running vulnerable software can pay the right price and use it for personal gains.\n\nThe Dyre Banking Trojan is a well-known zero-day exploit that took advantage of a critical vulnerability in Windows OS Vista, 7 and 8. The exploit was sold on the deep web for $15000 by an unknown seller. It was widely used by hackers to steal credit card information from infected computers.\n\nA group of cyber security researchers from Arizona State University have created a machine learning algorithm that studies hacking forums and marketplaces on the deep web and dark net. It then extracts specific information related to hacking attacks while ignoring references to drugs and contraband. The algorithm becomes more efficient as it learns and currently it is capable of detecting as high as 300 cyberthreats a week.\n\nSome of the significant zero-day exploits detected by the algorithm include an Android exploit and an Internet Explorer 11 exploit, available on sale for $20000 and $10000 respectively.\n\nProgressive developments in technology is gradually making it hard for businesses on the dark net to operate as usual. Similar to the gradually disappearing ‘anonymity factor” of Bitcoin, the machine learning algorithm is capable of significantly reducing threats from zero-day exploits.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

A este robo de bitcoins por valor de 65 millones de dólares (59 millones de euros) y que ha sido el mayor registrado hasta el momento, se le une, además, la depreciación sufrida por la moneda virtual motivada por la inseguridad que rodea a las inversiones en ella.\n\nPero no es la única divisa virtual que vive sumida en la inseguridad. El pasado junio, una de las rivales del bitcoin, Ethereum, padeció otro robo de similares proporciones: en este caso los hackers se hicieron con 60 millones de dólares (54 millones de euros). Y hace dos años la plataforma Mt Gox quebró tras las pérdidas sufridas por otro hurto.\n\n¿Cuánto han perdido hasta ahora los 'bancos' de bitcoins? En apenas dos meses el equivalente a 120 millones de dólares sustraídos.En total, estos bancos de bitcoins han sufrido ya el robo o la pérdida por error de casi 210.000 monedas virtuales -algunos no están contabilizados y la cotización ha variado su repercusión monetaria- desde que en mayo de 2010 se empleara el bitcoin por primera vez como medio de pago de una pizza. ¿Qué pretende hacer la UE con las monedas virtuales? El último ataque no ha hecho más que reabrir el debate en el seno de la Comisión Europea, y la UE se ha puesto como objetivo establecer un control sobre las monedas virtuales y sus inversores. Busca endurecer tanto su uso como los pagos online. ¿Por qué quiere la UE controlar las monedas virtuales? Una moneda virtual es, según la definición de la Comisión Europea una representación digital de valor, no emitida por un Banco Central, no necesariamente vinculada a monedas corrientes o divisas tradicionales y aceptada como medio de pago, que puede transferirse, almacenarse y comerciarse electrónicamente. Además de para evitar los robos y proteger a los inversores de la inseguridad que las azota, la UE quiere controlarlas porque si se tiene en cuenta sus características «existe el riesgo de que las transferencias de moneda virtual puedan ser utilizadas por organizaciones terroristas para ocultar las transferencias, dado que las transacciones con monedas virtuales se registran, pero no hay un mecanismo de información equivalente al del sistema de la banca tradicional para identificar actividades sospechosas», recoge un documento de la Comisión. ¿Es la primera vez que Bruselas pone coto a estos medios de pago? Sobre el papel sí. Aunque la directiva no está aprobada aún por el Parlamento Europeo, es la primera iniciativa legislativa europea de regulación de monedas virtuales, siguiendo las recomendaciones del Banco Central Europeo en su Informe de febrero de 2015. ¿Qué está haciendo ya Europa? La Comisión, especialmente acuciada por las puertas que podrían abrir las criptomonedas a la financiación ilegal de atentados, aprobó el pasado 7 de julio la propuesta de Directiva COM (2016) 450 final 2016/0208 (COD) de modificación de la Directiva de Prevención de Blanqueo de Capitales (EU) 2015/849. En ella se incluye a las agencias o plataformas de cambio de las monedas virtuales (exchagers) bajo la regulación de prevención de blanqueo de capitales y la financiación del terrorismo a nivel nacional. En consecuencia regulará la actividad de los exchangers, que deberán «aplicar controles» (la mayoría ya lo hacía) con «respecto al cliente a la hora de intercambiar monedas virtuales por monedas reales». ¿Qué supone esto para las plataformas de operaciones de bitcoin? Esto supone poner fin al anonimato en estos intercambios. Y, por supuesto, los exchangers deberán denunciar cualquier operación sospechosa a la Comisión de Prevención de Blanqueo de Capitales e Infracciones Monetarias (Sepblac). ¿Cómo afecta esto a los Estados miembros? Tienen la obligación de modificar sus respectivas normativas sobre Blanqueo de Capitales para incluir a las plataformas de cambio de monedas virtuales y proveedores de monederos o wallets antes del 1 enero de 2017. En el caso de España, las actividades de los exchangers que supongan una gestión o depósito de fondos de moneda corriente o virtual deberían quedar sujetas a la licencia de medio de pago regulada por la Ley 16/2009, de 13 de noviembre de servicios de pago. ¿Qué plantea en realidad Bruselas? Un registro oficial de posiciones en divisas digitales. La Comisión estima que el mejor modo de garantizar la aplicación de la normativa contra el lavado de dinero es la creación de una base centralizada de usuarios de bitcoin, sus carteras e identidades y operaciones financieras. Sería nutrido por cada Estado miembro y a él podrían acceder las autoridades contra el blanqueo. ¿Qué supone esta decisión? Es un primer paso para fiscalizar la tenencia de monedas virtuales, al igual que ocurre con las divisas físicas tradicionales. Por otro lado, los inversores perderán privacidad y una regulación muy restrictiva, según los expertos, podría reducir el número de usuarios de criptomonedas pues si no se aplica adecuadamente podrían ver menoscabado su derecho a la privacidad en las transacciones."", 'Bitcoin users in the New Hampshire seacoast delight in the coolest new local business to accept bitcoin, the independence-oriented currency of choice for many socially-concious and forward-thinking individuals.\n\nStreet in the west end of Portsmouth now takes bitcoin for everything on their menu, from Empanadas to Lamb Shawarma to Bibimbap and Singapore salad.\n\nWhat a treat it is to spend free market money right in my home town and support local service people and entrepreneurs in creating such a fine dining experience.\n\nNew Hampshire is on the forefront of free market principles in money and currency, with thousands of smart people moving here to celebrate the freedom and prosperity that comes from a cultural dedication to liberty.\n\nThrowing down his gauntlet, the wonderful man who made bitcoin happen at Street claims that their Sunday brunch is the best in all of Portsmouth.

08/08/2016,"['Late last week we reported that Bitfinex, a popular Hong Kong-based Bitcoin exchange was hacked, losing about $70M worth of customer’s bitcoin. The loss caused the price of Bitcoin to drop about 20%, and it still hasn’t fully recovered to pre-hack levels.\n\nIn the days following the hack little information was known about how it happened and how Bitfinex would reimburse affected users.\n\nSince the exchange used a service to individually segregate each customer’s funds in unique wallets, only some customers’s funds were drained, while others retained their full balances. The question then became would Bitfinex limit losses to only users whose wallets were compromised, or distribute them equally amongst all users (since the attack was essentially indiscriminate amongst random wallets).\n\nWe now have an answer, as the company has posted that they will distribute losses amongst all users to the tune of 36.067%, which is the total loss experienced by Bitfinex.\n\n“Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067%. In a later announcement we will explain in full detail the methodology used to compute these losses” – Bitfinex\n\nSo how will users get back that missing 36 percent? Bitfinex says they will issue a new token called BFX equal to each customer’s exact losses.\n\nEventually the token will be either be redeemed for full repayment or exchanged for shares in the exchange’s holding company. Interestingly, the token will also soon trade on Bitfinex’s platform, so the community can set it’s own price that values the chances that the exchange will actually follow through and repay holders of BFX.\n\nThe company said they they are also looking into raising capital from investors to pay back customers, but that discussions are still “at an early stage”.\n\nThe decision is a disappointment for customers who held currency other than Bitcoin (like USD or ETH) who originally may have thought their funds were safe.\n\nWhile the company justified their decision by saying that this type of shared loss is similar to what would happen if the company had to go through a bankruptcy liquidation, it’s still pretty unprecedented for an established financial institution to share losses amongst customers, especially when only one “currency” was comprised.\n\nIn terms of how the hack happened, it’s still pretty vague. All we know is that the company’s multi-signature accounts were somehow compromised.\n\nUsers can log in to the site now to check their balances, but the site is still in read-only mode, meaning users can’t trade, deposit, or withdraw coins.\n\nFeatured Image: Antana/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE (IMAGE HAS BEEN MODIFIED)', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Monday it plans to auction over 2,700 bitcoins that were forfeited during several cases, several of which stemmed from investigations of the online black market known as Silk Road.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service said that the online auction would be held on Aug. 22, and that potential bidders must register by Aug. 18.

As we enter the so-called era of 'fintech' (financial technology), the finances of your businesses must be reviewed as well. A hot topic in finance is Bitcoin, the digital currency that was invented by an anonymous person(s) called Satoshi Nakamoto. It has its ups and downs but one thing that is clear is that Bitcoin's community and users are growing worldwide. Is there anything about Bitcoin that businesses can make use of? The answer here is a solid yes in so many ways.\n\n1. Start accepting bitcoin as another payment method.\n\nMany businesses use PayPal and other payment methods. They are good, but one cannot deny that chargeback claims can be a pain to deal with, as well potentially causing losses or worse, bad reviews. Bitcoin transactions are final, so there is no way for scammers to claim chargebacks. Also, it makes a nice PR and can generate interest and business from the existing bitcoin community. Free visibility is good.\n\n2. Bring it on business trips\n\nA convenient method to bring and access money wherever you go on your business trip. There are plenty of bitcoin wallets that are secure and come with apps. Getting a bitcoin debit card is recommended here as a nice and convenient way to spend bitcoins as you travel, but otherwise it's an option to store value as you move about as well. For business people who go on multi-country visits, bitcoin service providers can help you bypass currency exchange as well. Just convert bitcoin into local currency as you travel around.\n\n3. Start thinking about blockchains\n\nHolding bitcoin is a practical, hands-on way to learn about blockchain, or the public ledger where all transactions are recorded and publicly viewable online. Many big companies have expressed interest in blockchain technology. Cause it has implications for cutting costs. Blockchain technology is still very much at the infancy stage and many startups are trying to establish themselves. It's good to be in the loop; after all, luck is preparation meets opportunity.\n\n4. Take advantage of bitcoin's fast payment to pay to or buy from overseas vendors\n\nFor businesses with overseas vendors, bitcoin transactions are worth considering. Wire transfers, when replaced with bitcoin transactions can be highly addictive because of how improved they are over the current international funds transfer system. In general, bitcoin transactions have lower fees, is faster and works during after bank hours, weekends and public holidays.\n\n5. Make accounting more transparent.\n\nBack to the essence of the blockchain - the recorded data that cannot be tampered with. Once the transaction was sent, it cannot be amended, edited or deleted. Transparency is good on two fronts. First the customer front. Fraudsters can't forge a transaction. Secondly on vendors. Time, amount and other details of the transaction are recorded permanently, stored on the internet. At a time where leaked documents can break a business beyond repair, hopping on the transparency train isn't a bad business strategy.\n\n6. Most-regulated cryptocurrency\n\nWhy not use some other cryptocurrencies, you ask? Of course you can. There are a lot out there. Some of the other cryptocurrencies come with their own advantages as well. But entering the world of cryptocurrency through Bitcoin first is recommended, for two reasons. One, it is the most regulated so far. It still lacks regulation, but advances have been made. Second, many other cryptocurrencies are marketed, directly or indirectly, as 'a better version of Bitcoin'. Some are more anonymous, some are faster, some has more applications, the list goes on. So it makes sense to spend time and understand Bitcoin first for a better understanding of how the other coins differ from it.\n\nLet's Talk\n\nI would love to hear what you think about this, if you have any questions or queries just drop me a line.

Apps that publish their source code so that the tech community can vet their software—like Breadwallet does—are especially vulnerable to this sort of attack, since anyone can copy the code to create their own version.\n\n""I think it would be good for Apple to go through some extra process to make sure they have the identity of the person posting any app in the finance section,"" Voisine said.\n\nEven though it\'s impossible to say right now how much money was lost, it seems like Apple is taking the issue seriously by removing the apps quickly. One big question that Apple isn\'t answering right now, however, is how these dangerous scams made it on to the App Store in the first place.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: An earlier version of this article had the headline ""Money-Stealing Apps are Popping Up on the App Store."" This has been changed to reflect new information about how much bitcoin was stolen from customers. This article has also been updated to include comment from Breadwallet co-founder Aaron Voisine.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Chaincode Labs developers Alex Morcos and Suhas Daftuar, and Blockstream developer Matt Corallo — three regular Bitcoin Core contributors ― will organize a month-long Bitcoin coding class at the Chaincode Labs offices in New York starting September 12. During this “Bitcoin Hacker Residency,” they will assist and mentor about half a dozen developers, with the goal of enabling them to contribute to Bitcoin on a protocol-level or to related projects such as FIBRE or the Lightning Network.\n\nBitcoin’s development community, and in particular the part of it that focuses on low-level protocol improvement, consists of a relatively small group of developers. Most of them work on Bitcoin Core, and they joined the project roughly between 2011 and 2013. Since then, not many newcomers have started contributing — with Morcos and Daftuar as some notable exceptions. Along with Corallo, they believe this is likely in part because the learning curve to contribute meaningfully has become quite steep.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Corallo explained:\n\n“I think there is a lot of understandable feelings of not wanting to contribute to Bitcoin Core and protocol-level development because 'nothing in Bitcoin is new again.’ When you come into Bitcoin as a developer, you're gonna first suggest the same 100 changes everyone else did the first year. And it doesn't usually feel great to be constantly told your ideas are not useful — especially when you're communicating over text, and you don’t see that people are trying to help. You just see a bunch of people who keep telling you you're wrong.”\n\nThe hacker residency is intended for established developers, preferably with experience in Bitcoin-related projects, who are not on a protocol-level competency yet. Corallo believes the month-long coding class should allow these developers to cross the gap and be able to contribute meaningfully to Bitcoin Core or related projects, if they want to.\n\n“There are a ton of Bitcoin developers who have never contributed to Bitcoin Core, or to low protocol development — lots of them because they feel ill-equipped to do so — for instance because the idea of going through rigorous review like we have to do sounds really daunting. So we're looking for those people to really learn how that works, and come to think about the issues that Bitcoin Core developers focus all day on,” Corallo said.\n\nThe hacker residency will have a hands-on approach, where participating developers mostly learn by doing. The goal is to put developers in a supportive environment where they can contribute to Bitcoin Core or other Bitcoin-related projects, with people around to help them where necessary. Additionally, there will be a few talks about Bitcoin's design elements and ways to think about Bitcoin protocol engineering.\n\nThe hacker residency should not be considered a recruitment scheme, however; the class is offered entirely on a no-strings-attached basis. Participating in the hacker residency is free, but availability is limited.

In a blogpost published last week, the platform confirmed losing 250 BTC and 185,000 ETH tokens during the hacking incident.\n\nGatecoin will start operating in a limited capacity from next week. Customers on the platform will be allowed to trade and transfer BTC, DGD, DAO, REP, EUR, USD, and HKD. All trades executed till September 1, 2016, will not be charged any trading fee. Those holding DAO and REP balances on the platform will only be allowed to withdraw and trade their digital, currency assets respectively until further notice.\n\nGatecoin’s Ether Debt\n\nA compensation mechanism has been set in place by Gatecoin to reimburse customers’ losses to some extent. Once the platform opens for business, customers who have lost Ethereum during the incident will be allowed to withdraw 10 percent of their original holdings, while the remaining amount will be compensated with Ether Debt (ETD). The Ether debt will be settled over time as the platform builds liquidity through investments and regular operations.\n\nGatecoin reportedly has an ETH reserve of less than 25000, which will be enough to settle 10 percent of the losses, while maintaining a small buffer amount to account for any errors in transactions. The company is also raising funds from investors to compensate its customers. Gatecoin has already raised $500,000 from a Japanese investment firm, and is currently engaged in talks with multiple investment sources to raise the remaining amount.\n\nEthereum Classic to Come Soon on Gatecoin\n\nWithin a month of its relaunch, Gatecoin has plans to introduce new cryptocurrency tradable assets, including Ethereum Classic. Customers with Ethereum balance on the platform prior to hard-fork will also be allowed to split and withdraw ETH and ETC before the ETC trading feature is announced. Those with balances over 10 ETH at the time of security breach will be eligible to claim free Ledger hardware wallets from Gatecoin.\n\nAs the investigation into the hacking incident continues, Gatecoin has introduced new security features to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring. Some of the security features include new servers and hosting service with the auto-updating feature. The company has also set up additional firewalls at the server provider level, which when combined with round the clock monitoring and regular penetration testing makes the platform almost impenetrable. The company has also redesigned its multi-sig wallet systems and updated its system architecture.\n\nThese hacking incidents involving Gatecoin and Bitfinex has got all digital currency platform reevaluating their existing security features to ensure that there are no vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. Fortunately, the former’s losses are significantly lesser than that of Bitfinex, allowing it to bounce back into business within months. The company is also expected to settle debts much faster than Bitfinex.\n\nRef: Gatecoin | Image: NewsBTC', 'Warning - there was an unexpected script error. Application may not work as expected.']"
08/09/2016,"['Bitcoin suffered yet another blow last week when Bitfinex, one of the cryptocurrency’s largest exchanges, suffered a hack that cost its users about $65 million. Every one of its investors saw their funds suddenly drop by 36%, as the company decided to “socialize” the losses.\n\nThe source of the security breach remains unconfirmed, as Bitfinex continues to work with “authorities” (it’s not clear which ones) to pinpoint what happened. But the details of the hack aren’t its only mystery. Burnt traders are now struggling to figure out something even more basic—who exactly is behind Bitfinex and where are those people located?\n\nThe exchange was handling $407.2 million in monthly trade volume before the hack, but there is precious little information about Bitfinex’s origins and founders.\n\nThis differs from exchanges of comparable size. Kraken, a US-based exchange, lists all of its team’s major members on its website, with photos and short bios. Coinbase, the first regulated bitcoin exchange in the US, maintains a community page for its users and has offered its founders up for interviews. Bitfinex has done none of these things. There are no “About Us” pages to peruse, or trade-press profiles of founders.\n\nThis has caused confusion and frustration among Bitfinex traders whose funds disappeared, who want to put a human face on the company. When the exchange Mt. Gox went insolvent in early 2014, some investors flew to Tokyo to confront its management. But if aggrieved investors were to fly to Hong Kong to knock on Bitfinex’s door, they would be hard-pressed to find someone to harangue.\n\nAlmost all of the company’s public relations after the hack have been led by Zane Tackett, a “community manager” for Bitfinex currently based in California. When traders press for more information about the company and its investigations, they often complain on Reddit about getting unsatisfactory answers.\n\n“WHO is in control of the wallets and moving coins right now?” writes one commenter on Reddit. “If he [Tackett] doesn’t know the answers to these questions, what makes him so sure you [sic] he is not working for crooks? Is he passing on our concerns to management, and comfortable with their explanation? Or is it a 1-way dialogue?”\n\nThe company claims to be “based” in Hong Kong, but it appears to have no central office. According to a CFTC document issued after the company was fined, Bitfinex registered in the notoriously opaque British Virgin Islands under the name BFNXA, which owns a Hong Kong subsidiary. The address listed for “Bitfinex Limited” in the Hong Kong’s company registrar is in fact the office for Proxy Management Consultants Ltd—a firm that helps companies incorporate locally.\n\nMembers of the bitcoin community in Hong Kong tell Quartz that Bitfinex’s employees are spread across different countries. LinkedIn, for example lists J.L. van der Velde as Bitfinex’s Taiwan-based CEO and Raphaelle Nicole as its France-based founder. Other employees reportedly live in London, California, and Hong Kong. None of them have come forward personally and publicly to take responsibility for the hacks or explain what might have caused them (nor did any respond to Quartz’s requests for comment on this piece).\n\nAccording to Larry Salibra, co-founder of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, Bitfinex’s leadership team is at best press-shy, and at worst shadowy. Over the course of years, the company’s founders seldom appeared at local events or meetups. This evasiveness should have signaled to investors that something was amiss, says Salibra.\n\n“Typically when you run a business you want to build a corporate brand, especially in technology or things when there’s risk,” says Salibra. “When a co-founder of a company, especially a financial one, isn’t interested in associating his personal brand with the company brand, it immediately raises red flags,” says Salibra.\n\nTo the average consumer, it might seem unusual to dump money into an exchange without knowing a little bit about who runs it. But not everyone agrees.\n\nJoseph Wang, a bitcoin researcher in Hong Kong who lost “thousands” of dollars from the Bitfinex hack, says that he met Bitfinex’s CEO and does not suspect any intentional wrongdoing. “I don’t get the sense that he’s shy because he’s hiding something,” Wang says. “I think he’s shy just because he’s shy.”\n\nIn Wang’s view, the company’s paper trail of incorporations, licenses, and bank accounts—which pass through Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the British Virgin Islands—are “standard for any international fund.” The company’s perpetual evasiveness, meanwhile, is not necessarily a sign that its founders are crooks, he says.\n\nHow can a bitcoin investor distinguish between a bona-fide, secure exchange and one that can be breached or is a scam? It’s near impossible.\n\nFor one thing, in the nascent stages of this cryptocurrency, hacks like these will likely continue, as exchanges figure out how to make security airtight. And even though almost all US-dollar trading is done through venture capital-backed firms (which ensure some degree of accountability), some holdouts, like the anonymously operated BTC-E, still command a sizable slice of trading volume. For cryptocurrency traders, there’s only one golden rule: caveat emptor, or buyer beware.\n\n“If you’re in the bitcoin world then you have to figure out who’s honest and who’s not,” says Wang. “And even when you meet honest people, honest people mess up. As far as I can tell, Bitfinex just messed up. If you don’t want to actually roll your own parachute, then don’t do anything involved with bitcoin”', 'The U.S. government is selling 2,700 bitcoin, valued at nearly $1.6 million based on current exchange rates, later this month.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service, the enforcement arm of federal courts, is holding an auction for the seized bitcoins on August 22; bidders must register by August 17 in order to participate. The electronic currency was seized during a bunch of different cases, but a lot of it comes from investigations of the Silk Road.\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency, backed by a peer-to-peer network and advanced mathematics. Its decentralized nature makes it appealing to privacy advocates and others, but also to criminals.\n\nMost infamously, bitcoin was the currency of choice for the Silk Road, which for a long time served as an eBay equivalent for drug dealers. The agency says 2.8 bitcoins in this latest auction were seized from Ross Ulbricht, creator of the Silk Road. Most of the coins for sale come from a few prominent cases.\n\n1,294 bitcoins were seized from Matthew Gillum, a Silk Road drug dealer sentenced to nine years in prison in 2015.\n\n65 come from Carl Force, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent sentenced for stealing bitcoins during the Silk Road investigation.\n\n664 came from Sean Roberson, who allegedly set up a store that sold stolen credit card and debit card numbers.\n\nThis is not the first Bitcoin auction conducted by the Marshals Service. The enforcement agency has sold off bitcoins four times since June 2014.\n\nThe Silk Road was an online marketplace thought to be beyond the reach of government agencies. Distributed exclusively through Tor, a tool for anonymously browsing the web, it quickly became infamous as a marketplace for illegal guns and drugs. More than 1.5 transactions took place on the site, all conducted using bitcoin.\n\nCrime obviously isn’t the only use for this currency, just the one that garners headlines. In theory, an online currency like bitcoin could serve as cash for the web, allowing online transactions without merchant processing fees.', 'While many people hear the word “Bitcoin” and still think of crime, compared to previous types of digital currencies used by criminals such as e-gold and Liberty Reserve dollars, Bitcoin is quite different.\n\nAt least according to Jason Weinstein, partner at international law firm Steptoe & Johnson, who previously spent 15 years at the Department of Justice as a federal prosecutor, with the final third of that time devoted to supervising computer and organized crimes.\n\nWhereas the previous digital currencies were created and maintained by and for criminals, “Bitcoin was a digital currency designed for legitimate purposes that was being misappropriated by criminals,” he says in the latest episode of my podcast, Unchained, which explores blockchain and fintech (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio). (Links to this particular episode: Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio.)\n\nDuring the session, he and Alan Cohn, of counsel at Steptoe, who had served as assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security for nine years helping to coordinate cyber-crime policy, discuss their work with the Blockchain Alliance, a ten-month-old coalition of more than 25 companies from the blockchain industry and more than 25 law enforcement agencies both domestically and abroad.\n\nTune in to find out how Richard Branson’s Necker Island played into the formation of the Blockchain Alliance, how regulators’ perceptions toward cryptocurrencies have evolved over time, and what legal and regulatory challenges a situation like the DAO and the DAO hack present. (The DAO, which stands for decentralized autonomous organization, was essentially a leaderless venture fund governed by software code that, in May, raised the equivalent of $150 million in a cryptocurrency called ether in the largest crowdfunding in history. Contributors received DAO tokens that gave them voting rights over which ventures the DAO would support. However, in June, someone exploited a loophole in the code to steal the equivalent of $50 million from the fund, which might have, and may still, trigger the concern of regulators since investors were hurt — except that the community then attempted to restore funds by, again, using technology. But then that plan went awry, so the final fallout remains to be seen.)\n\nWeinstein and Cohn also talk about their work with blockchain at Steptoe. In fact, the firm announces, through this podcast and this accompanying article, that the firm is launching a multidisciplinary practice that will serve not only blockchain companies but other companies affected by blockchain in industries ranging from energy, transportation and international trade to financial services, intellectual property and government affairs and public policy.\n\nWeinstein says that the earliest adopters of every new technology are criminals, but that what differentiates Bitcoin from previous digital currencies tailor-made for criminals is, “Bitcoin was created with changing the world in mind. I think the person or people … were motivated by the financial crisis of 2008 and by the desire to empower people to not be entirely dependent on banks. One of the ironies of the way Bitcoin has developed is people who were drawn to it early were drawn to it because it provided the prospect of disintermediating banks and other large institutions when in fact banks and large institutions have recognized the power both in Bitcoin and the blockchain, which is the technology that underlies it.”\n\nHe says the inspiration for the Alliance came about from the lessons learned in the early days of the internet when criminals such as child pornographers were exploiting the technology. At that time, law enforcement reached out to industry for help. Weinstein say that the “critical difference” in the formation of the Blockchain Alliance is the fact that it was created by industry who then contacted law enforcement.\n\nCohn also discussed what questions the DAO and the DAO hack raise for law enforcement and regulators. “The speed at which the DAO emerged from the Ethereum ecosystem and then the speed with what we’ll call the ‘hack’ occurred” — Cohn is referencing the fact that the system wasn’t necessarily attacked but a loophole was exploited — “I think, presents both a challenge to the regulatory agencies but also a demonstration of the speed at which the regulators and others are going to need to work in order to try keep up with developments in this ecosystem,” says Cohn.\n\n“The DAO’s creation itself raises all sort of questions about, is this a corporation? Is this a general or limited partnership? Is it a crowdfunding exercise? Is it a venture capital exercise or firm? And the DAO tokens, which people could buy with ether, did that represent a security? Was that a commodity? A derivative? Does its characterization change depending on whether you’re exercising voting rights or not? Whether it’s sold through the primary offering, or secondary offerings through exchanges? And so each of those questions is a novel legal issue in and of itself,” he says.\n\nSimilarly, it’s not yet clear whether the code is the law, as the DAO creators suggested, or whether the DAO falls under the criminal or civil laws of a range of jurisdictions.\n\nAs the blockchain and cryptocurrency communities continue to wade further into these murky waters, the Alliance and Steptoe will work to inform regulators. The Alliance in particular will help bridge any gaps between industry and law enforcement while Steptoe, with its multidisciplinary blockchain practice, will offer legal and strategic advice, as well as help to shape policy in this are.\n\n“Whether we’re looking at smart contracts as applied to digital rights management and intellectual property or as they apply to insurance contracts or leases, there’s a lot of work to be done in understanding the technology itself: how the technology is being applied in a particular situation, understanding how the current law would apply to that and how it’s meant to apply to those types of situations — and then being able to walk though, what areas are known, how would interpretations need to change or how would policy need to adjust, or how may it be that a company or a group of companies or an entire industry needs to go to government and initiate the processes that would be necessary in order to evolve legal interpretation, evolve regulatory regimes, evolve laws to adopt the new technology,” says Cohn.\n\nTune in to this episode on the web, Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, or TuneIn Radio to find out what areas of blockchain and cryptocurrency are of greatest interest to law enforcement now, the different approaches regulators are so far taking to this emerging technology and which regulators are working with the Alliance.', 'As news major bitcoin exchange Bitfinex was robbed of more than $60m continues to echo across the media, less clear for many is who – and what – is at the center of this story.\n\nBased in Hong Kong, Bitfinex was the largest bitcoin exchange by US dollar volume prior to the hack. Since opening in 2012, the exchange has attracted a clientele looking to corner a piece of the growing market for leveraged trading amid declining volatility in the bitcoin price.\n\nThe exchange would go on to develop a positive reputation among traders for peer-to-peer margin trading facilities that offered users access to a key source of liquidity. According to exchange and trading experts, it was this aspect that both fueled interest in the platform and gave traders a reason to first engage on the website.\n\nBTC VIX, an admin at bitcoin trading club Whale Club, believes that this innovation helped boost the exchange\'s profile.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""That was extremely valuable because it wasn\'t just, we\'re allowing margin trading and margin comes from some magic funds. We actually saw that people were willing to lend their funds and have other people engage in margin trading.”\n\nAt the same time, recurring platform issues drew criticisms, sparking the moniker ""Bugfinex"" among some segments of the community on social media.\n\nBitfinex also made a name for itself by way of its staff and the connection with Whale Club (not to be confused with trading platform Whaleclub), the bitcoin-centric trading community that, more often than not, hosted exchange staffers for chats about the marketplace.\n\nBeyond an exchange, Bitfinex became a focal point for the development of bitcoin’s trading market, perhaps exemplifying both the best and the most controversial aspects of the space.\n\nBut that success now hangs in the balance.\n\nLast week, the exchange lost nearly 120,000 bitcoins in a hack observers say has led Bitfinex into uncharted waters on legal and regulatory fronts.\n\nA new plan to effectively bail-in the service by forcing a 36% haircut – while also issuing a cryptographic token tied to future revenues – has also raised questions across the industry.\n\nStrange beginnings\n\nThe origins of Bitfinex start with a lesser-known exchange called Bitcoinica.\n\nBitfinex is essentially the reborn version of that earlier exchange, as it used its source code as a basis for its platform. Sources at the time indicate that it was less than a year after Bitcoinica\'s fall that Bitfinex opened for business.\n\nLaunched in late 2011, Bitcoinica sought to position itself as a location for sophisticated trading activities, offering leveraged trading options to users.\n\nYet within a year of its launch, the exchange suffered a debilitating theft that resulted in the loss of more than 43,000 BTC (worth $200,000). As Ars Techina reported at the time, the incident included the theft from the platform itself. Other users are believed to have lost smaller amounts.\n\nBut the thefts didn’t end there.\n\nWeeks later, a second incident resulted in the loss of more than 18,000 BTC (worth close to $90,000 at then-current prices). Bitcoinica was subsequently taken offline, and soon after accusations began to fly that founder Zhou Tong himself was behind the theft.\n\nUltimately, the exchange’s collapse sparked civil litigation.\n\nTraders in the community say one of Bitfinex’s early moves as an exchange was to build its order book, a process that essentially entailed drawing liquidity from bitcoin exchange Bitstamp. The exchange would go on to alter the code and later looked at using AlphaPoint for its back-end infrastructure, though that initiative fell to the wayside during initial testing.\n\nExchange at a glance\n\nPrior to going offline, Bitfinex offered trading between digital and government-issued currencies. The exchange primarily served as a place for the trading of bitcoin and US dollars, though other digital currencies like litecoin and ether (and later ethereum classic) were ultimately added.\n\nUsers can deposit funds and trade between those pairs, or borrow funds from one another in a peer-to-peer fashion to engage in that activity as well.\n\nBut while this information is public, the exchange was not the most open in its public presence.\n\nIt\'s since come to light that Bitfinex, according to its now widely circulating terms of service, is registered in the British Virgin Islands under the name iFinex Inc, with subsidiaries Bitfinex in Hong Kong and BFXNA in the US.\n\nMore is known about its team, some of whom were vocal on message boards and other focal points for traders.\n\nData from LinkedIn points to a globally distributed Bitfinex team, including founder Raphael Nicolle, who is based in France, and director of community and product development Zane Tackett, based in San Francisco.\n\nSeveral executives and others tied to the exchange are also based in the California region. These include director of applications Drew Samsen, based in Orange County, and Craig Sellars, who has advised the exchange in the past.\n\nOthers in the Bitfinex orbit are based elsewhere in the world, including CSO Phil Potter, based in New York, and director of infrastructure Adam Chamely, who is in Atlanta, LinkedIn profiles reveal.\n\nRepresentatives have said in the past that the exchange is self-funded, a position driven by trading volume and the fees collected over time.\n\nFurther, the exchange has moved to invest in other services in the digital currency ecosystem. These include ShapeShift, the digital currency exchange that raised $1.6m in funding last September, and Netki, an identity-focused startup that raised $3.5m in July.\n\nOperational problems\n\nFor all its success in attracting users to the platform, Bitfinex was dogged by technical issues, a characteristic that traders say fostered concerns among some segments of the community and, ultimately, led others to look for alternatives in the exchange ecosystem.\n\nThe exchange experienced periods of downtime that it attributed to data center problems, API issues and data corruption. While any website is prone to technical problems, it was the recurring nature of these situations that led to the ""Bugfinex"" moniker.\n\nSome of these problems have impacted the price of bitcoin itself.\n\nIn August of last year, Bitfinex closed its order books due to what it said were post-processing problems, a move that came a week after a ""flash crash"" on the exchange sent bitcoin markets nosediving. Issues reported at the time were attributed to the AlphaPoint integration Bitfinex had undertaken.\n\nThat integration itself would prove problematic, traders say, though the justification was clear – the platform needed to be scaled.\n\nThough parts of the system were brought online, issues with how the integration affected the exchange\'s ordering system are said to have doomed the initiative.\n\nContinued criticism\n\nDay-to-day problems aside, the exchange has has stoked its share of criticism and controversy since it first opened its doors.\n\nCommentators took issue with Bitfinex’s use of the Bitcoinica source code soon after it entered beta testing. In early 2015, some in the bitcoin trading community sharply criticized Bitfinex CSO Phil Potter after he disclosed that he was trading on the exchange during a conversation on Whale Club.\n\nExchange representatives later moved to clarify Potter’s remarks, saying that they believed its staff can and should have access to the trading platform, albeit under the supervision of administrators.\n\nStill, the exchange faced accusations of privileged trading, evoking memories of Mt Gox and allegations of manipulated trading that were later confirmed after the Japanese bitcoin exchange collapsed.\n\nIn late 2015, rumors surfaced that the exchange was being investigated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission after a leaked email began circulating via social media.\n\nThe agency, one of several that regulates commodities trading in the US, would go on to fine Bitfinex $75,000, drawing issue with how it held custody over user funds prior to the settlement.\n\nUncharted waters\n\nOne way to look at the history of bitcoin is through the success (and failures) of its exchange ecosystem, and for better or for worse, Bitfinex now occupies a controversial spot in that history.\n\nLast week’s theft is unlikely to immediately spell doom for the exchange, traders say, though the success or failure of its recovery plan and the controversial token it has issued will no doubt have a significant impact.\n\nIn the immediate term, from the trader perspective, getting access to as-yet-unreleased funds is the key factor.\n\nBitfinex could continue to operate given the attractiveness of the kind of margin trading it offers, but whether traders will move to pull funds or continue to support the company remains to be seen.\n\nWilting Bitfinex logo via cryptograffiti\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to correct information regarding Bitfinex\'s corporate registration and subsidiary structure.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It is now awaiting a second reading by Senate.\n\nOpponents of the bill, however, claim that the language of it has the potential to reduce California’s capability of supporting digital currency startups in the state.\n\nBitcoin Foundation Education Committee chair Colin Gallagher is one opponent who has called on people to sign a petition opposing the bill after writing on a forum today stating that the new version of the bill is ‘even worse than before.’\n\nOn the petition’s page it states:\n\nUnfortunately, the bill’s language is so vague that it’s unclear what companies even count as “virtual currency businesses.\n\nIf AB1326 is signed into law, companies that handle bitcoin may find themselves subject to dealing with extensive paperwork and legislative hurdles.\n\nBitcoin’s Disruptive Power\n\nAs a relatively new digital currency bitcoin and blockchain have the ability to challenge the authority of government and conformist financial systems.\n\nThey can also be used in terrorist financing and money laundering, factors which have driven governments to introduce regulations that are aimed at controlling the digital currency.\n\nOf course, with these controls, businesses that deal with bitcoin are finding themselves exposed to more red tape, which is where the New York BitLicense and the proposed California Bitcoin License come into play.\n\nDespite the fact that these laws may be attempting to do good for the wider public, they should take into account the fact that bitcoin needs to be further explored and developed. If bitcoin is to continue being scrutinized, bitcoin startups are likely to reach a stymie as they look elsewhere to start their bitcoin companies.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The burgeoning online gaming industry is turning its attention to incorporating digital currencies, including bitcoin, into various platforms to get people excited about blockchain and the use of the digital currency.\n\nTwo companies taking advantage of the market are MandelDuck, the company behind such games as SaruTobi, Game of Birds and KA-GE and Counterparty, a peer-to-peer financial platform built on the bitcoin blockchain that allows users to create and trade digital tokens, write smart contracts and execute them on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDeveloped by Christian Moss, lead developer of MandelDuck, Takara is the first ever bitcoin geocaching iOS app that has included support for Counterparty tokens. This partnership gives gamers the ability to plant and hunt for bitcoin treasures across the globe, utilizing IndieSquare’s API.\n\nBased in Tokyo, IndieSquare provides developers with digital token management features saving them the task of running and maintaining their own Bitcoin and Counterparty systems. This, in turn, means that developers can focus their efforts on game play. For players, it means that they can securely store, use and send their blockchain assets via their mobile devices.\n\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, co-founder of IndieSquare, Koji Higashi, said, “Application of blockchain technology in the gaming industry may very well be the first real reason for regular people to get excited about the tech and push wider adoption of bitcoin as well.”\n\nHigashi said that IndieSquare has the most popular mobile token wallet in the world with an active user-base. “As more applications are built upon IndieSquare, connecting other interesting apps such as Takara will be easy and will provide further utility to your own service.”\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Moss said that using Counterparty tokens within Takara was the start of digital property rather than virtual assets being tied to a single use case.\n\n“I was interested in the idea of users collecting and geocaching tokenized game items,” Moss said. “Currently Spells of Genesis and a few other projects are using Counterparty tokens as game items, so it seemed like a good fit compared to other protocols such as Colored Coins.”\n\nDirector of the Counterparty Foundation, Trevor Altpeter, told Bitcoin Magazine that in-game assets present the opportunity to create advanced video game economies containing value that is fungible in the real world.\n\n“This concept has already been demonstrated through features like World of Warcraft Gold and Counter Strike [where] Global Offensive skins are being used as value stores in their respective game economies.”\n\nHe added that Counterparty assets are an improvement over the existing model, offering enhanced functionality, while also reducing counterparty risk inherent to the current centralized custody of these assets that ultimately limits their utility and value in the real world. The Counterparty tokens in Takara can be used for coupons, tickets, loyalty points, company stocks or even game items.\n\nFor the teams involved, the functional decentralized exchange that Counterparty offers was the key differentiator compared to similar protocols. It is the decentralized exchange itself that would, essentially, draw more people toward the blockchain technology giving users more exciting interaction, making the concept of it more attractive.\n\nPopularity of the Gaming Industry\n\nAccording to the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) over 150 million Americans play video games. Approximately 63 percent of homes have a least one person playing video games on a regular basis or at least three hours per week.\n\nWhen it comes to the monetary value of the gaming industry, the ESA reports that in 2014 the gaming industry sold more than 135 million games, generating $22 billion in revenue.\n\nUnsurprisingly, video games are a strong contender for economic growth.\n\nOf course, with more people using their phones to download and play games, consumers are becoming more interested in games that aren’t your run-of-the-mill casino, dice or gambling games. Games that are challenging and provide rewards are more interesting, which is why games such as Spells of Genesis, Takara, Game of Birds and Sarutobi are becoming increasingly popular.\n\nIs Crypto too Complex?\n\nMoss said that while it’s interesting to explore a new space with the potential for innovative games, he thinks that for regular users grasping the potential of crypto may be a little too complex for them.\n\n“At the moment, most games are gambling dice games with the emphasis being on the financial rewards rather than innovative gameplay,” he said. “However, with Counterparty and tokenized game items I hope this will allow the development of crypto games that are not just about winning bitcoin but rather collecting value and wealth through blockchain assets and game items.”\n\nThe popularity of PokemonGo, for example, is a clear indication that people are interested in innovative gameplay that involves gamers with their surroundings. Takara, in fact, is similar to PokemonGo, but instead of users collecting Pokemon they are finding bitcoins and various tokens.\n\nHigashi suggested that adding bitcoin to PokemonGo would have the potential to boost the adoption rate of bitcoin to the wider community.\n\n“If we can somehow insert blockchain into the equation, say being able to trade their Pokemon securely on the blockchain with other players, that alone can easily be a killer app for bitcoin.”\n\nCurrently, however, there aren’t many games that implement crypto in them. Nevertheless, with the release of IndieSquare’s API and SDK tools it will be easier for other creators to include crypto into their products.\n\n“I predict as a game like Spells of Genesis becomes popular, other games will implement the use of SoG cards in their own games in order to attract SoG’s user base,” said Moss. “This ripple effect of sharing game items for users will incentivize other game development in their space.”', 'The past couple years have been interesting. I\'ve stood by and watched a number of rumors about my personal life circulate and die. You cannot address every conspiracy theory or half-baked reddit post about yourself once you become a public personality. Once you get into that tit for tat, it\'s game over for your peace of mind... and your free time.\n\nThere\'s no need to clear up the record, but I want to. As a public personality, one of my favorite quotes is ""if you want to be understood, explain."" The public demands that, as they should. And as my health appears to be in decline, I don\'t want dishonest people writing my life\'s story.\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nI moved to Los Angeles from south Florida after a show idea I had was successfully crowdfunded, raising more than US $6,000 on the Internet to produce a season of a grassroots YouTube show dedicated to many of the political and economic issues raised from my bedroom in Florida, where the original audio podcast was ""headquartered."" I loved that period of my life in Florida, interviewing local politicos and self-help gurus and bartenders. If I could go back to that, I would.\n\nBecause it was perfect.\n\nIn Los Angeles, I aligned with a toxic personality who billed himself as an attorney. In reality, his attorney status had been revoked after a couple DUIs in the state of California, but since an acquaintance Joe Rogan had vouched for the guy, I allowed him into my world. What a mistake. He squandered a significant portion of the crowdfund and excitement around the show; we parted ways shortly after realizing he wasn\'t the real thing, despite his baseless threats of retribution.\n\nHis personality defects were ultimately my fault, because I was desperate to have a contact ""on the ground"" in LA before getting there, and on paper he was everything I wanted - not the fraudulent alcoholic he actually was, but the grounded legal mind I knew I needed during that volatile, growth-oriented period of my media life.\n\nAside from that, Los Angeles was transformative. Joe Rogan told me I would be his podcast\'s ""politics contributor"" and would be on every couple months to share the latest political scandals with his audience. That turned out to be a bald-faced lie; when Bitcoin, which I had championed, dropped into the $300s, then $200s, Mr. Rogan stopped replying to my emails and text messages. His producer Brian Redban implied on Twitter I was mentally unwell, and I was - abandoned, in debt, attacked personally in ways that made my days reporting on the N.S.A. seem downright splendid by comparison.\n\nI left Los Angeles as a result of economic necessity and moved to Colorado. In Colorado, I found a place to recover and rehabilitate my image, but not a lot of free love. Colorado may have legal weed, but it\'s no Haight-Ashbury love in - even in 2016, it\'s do or die, do it for yourself, Midwestern frontier ethic. And in retrospect, I like that. I needed that Midwestern sensibility. LA had made me spoiled: beautiful women, incredible former close friends including the screenwriter Ally Maynard and country legend Shooter Jennings and a couple of young billionaires up north in the Bay Area. I loved San Francisco and its energy.\n\nI needed Colorado, though.\n\nIt was very humbling in Colorado, for me. Bottoming out and rebuilding from scratch, alone... The crypto markets were decimated at that point in time; I was worth less than a homeless person, but proud. I applied for jobs at Walmart and Target, receiving rejections. When a Walmart opening had me in mind, I gratefully accepted, driving out there as fast as I could. An email from a longtime reader I read in the parking lot caused me to tell my training manager I\'d have to respectfully decline the job offer for greeter. Other life plans.\n\nCANADA\n\nI flew up to Canada to learn more about BitGold, and its parent Goldmoney. An entrepreneur around my age, Roy Sebag, had grown the publicly traded Goldmoney and built its popular subsidiary BitGold into a million-plus community of users transacting in verifiable, insured physical gold. We became friends and I used it as an opportunity to learn as much about the business as possible. Goldmoney had hired former PayPal Canada CEO Darrell MacMullin to helm its BitGold unit, and attracted a number of other thought leaders in the space, including Peter Schiff\'s SchiffGold, which was recently acquired by Sebag\'s company. The company is funded by a number of savvy financial elites including precious metals entrepreneur Eric Sprott and the legendary Soros family.\n\nThe deeper I dug, the more admiration for the self-made Sebag, both personally and as a sound money supporter.\n\nSebag, a former hedge fund manager, set his sights fully on fixing the fractured financial system. And to him, building a payments network on the immutable, ancient first currency - gold - just made more sense, not only ideologically, but mathematically: you can move gold ownership around the world faster and cheaper than fiat currency, which was Sebag\'s breakthrough realization after years of working within the traditional financial system and profiting from it. It\'s a realization that could net Sebag and his Colorado born co-founder Josh Crumb a number of devoted users in the years ahead.\n\nCALIFORNIA / TORONTO\n\nAs fascinating as the re-utilization of gold as currency is to a researcher like me, I was also intrigued by the emergence of ""Bitcoin 2.0"" technology Ethereum, which was headlined at several meetups I had attended in Toronto and back in California. Turing Complete and invented by a trio of crypto geniuses, everyone from Microsoft to Chris Dixon had been saying good things about Ethereum publicly, so I knew I had to dive in.\n\nI became friends with co-founder Taylor Gerring, interviewing him on my YouTube channel several times and showing him around Toronto when he was in town. Mr. Gerring is a different\n\nkind of techno-industrialist. Having built the better mousetrap along with colleagues Vitalik Buterin, Anthony Di Iorio, and Roman Mandeleil, Mr. Gerring always seemed more interested in making sure that anyone who wanted to understand why it\'s better could be shown that, without alienating anyone who doesn\'t yet perceive the importance of blockchain-based commerce. I sensed a level of compassion and original vision desperately lacking in most other areas of the crypto economy.\n\nPARENTS\n\nI\'m amending this section out of respect to my parents, but the fact remains, they didn\'t have my back when I needed it. You don\'t forget that, family or not. And you do not forget when a long time friend or family member loses confidence in you. Crypto has not been the easiest ride, but it has been the ride I\'ve been waiting for all my life. A chance to create something new in the wake of the broken, senseless old stuff.\n\nAnd it\'s all good, to be honest, even the bad moments. I wouldn\'t trade the lessons I\'ve learned for a million dollars. But I know that if a million or two is all that\'s ahead for me, well, that\'s not the reward any of us were after. It\'s still about building a better, more sensible world. As millennials, we do not have to be perfect. We simply have to be moving toward a better, more sensible world - we will build it, and our children will play in it. That\'s worth fighting for.\n\nTELEVISION\n\nI was blessed to be a weekly panelist on the now defunct national cable program, Take Part Live. Minutes from my apartment in LA, it seemed a dream come true - I was allowed to talk about Bitcoin, gold, monetary freedom, surveillance and corruption weekly. Their host, Cara Santa Maria, was gracious, intelligent, and a friend to me.\n\nInexplicably, the show was canceled after that season, I was never invited back, Santa Maria and her co-host were fired (he later got a contributor role at MSNBC), and they were replaced with a fat, entitled, intellectually empty Meghan McCain, the daughter of senior United States Senator John McCain from Arizona. So unpopular was the ""Meghan season"" of Take Part Live, the show and network were shuttered after that season.\n\nDisclosure: At time of publication, I hold some ether, bitcoin, gold, and US Dollars in my long-term portfolio.', 'The bitcoin market was shut down last week after it was discovered that hackers had targeted the digital currency platform and stolen 119,756 bitcoins, or $65 million, from users’ accounts.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'In 2009, a mysterious and brilliant software developer named Satoshi Nakamoto — a pseudonym Craig Wright created for himself — invented the concept of Bitcoin, a global digital currency, or cryptocurrency, that isn’t tied to any single banking system or government. Nakamoto’s invention was created with the intention of freeing people from the authority of banks and nations in regard to monetary transactions. But a funny thing happened on the way to Utopia: The banks started using the same technology that was invented to accommodate Bitcoin.\n\nThat cutting-edge technology is known as blockchain, and it could result in faster, safer and cheaper transactions for you, the banking customer — as well as change the way banks do business. Here’s everything you need to know about Bitcoin, blockchain technology, and how it’s changing the banking industry.\n\nRead: History of Online Banking: How Internet Banking Became Mainstream\n\nWhat is blockchain technology?\n\nBlockchain technology began as a way to keep track of Bitcoin transactions and balances without a central authority, like a government or bank. This record-keeping strategy used a blockchain wallet, which was essentially an online wallet that held a person’s Bitcoin balance.\n\nBut despite the fact that banks are Bitcoin’s nemesis, banks are now actually beginning to use Bitcoin’s blockchain technology. That’s because as impressive as Bitcoin is, the blockchain technology it inspired is much more revolutionary, said Eric Marks, senior director with West Monroe Partners’ Banks & Credit Unions practice, a consulting firm for the financial industry. So what exactly is blockchain technology? Hold onto your laptop; this might get technical.\n\n“Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology, which uses algorithms and protocols to create shared, decentralized, digital transaction databases,” said Marks. What that means, basically, is that distributed ledgers operate using a network of computers that hold identical copies of database information. Each ledger is continually replicated with new “blocks” of records, or transactions, which are then validated and added to the database in a linear, chronological fashion — like a chain, Marks explained. Hence, the term “blockchain.”\n\nIn this way, no single individual has the power to block someone from adding data to the ledger — but at the same time, all ledger holders must agree that the transaction happened. “This creates a level of transparency, security and reliability that does not exist in traditional databases,” said Marks. He added that this introduction of a shared infrastructure has the ability to change processes in many industries, but especially banking.\n\nHow Blockchain Increases Data Security\n\nIf a shared infrastructure — one in which anyone can get into and fiddle around with at any time — sounds more frightening than handing over your credit card to your teenager, think again, said Marks. Security and system resiliency are actually top appeals of blockchain.\n\n“With blockchain, there is no central point of failure,” Marks said. “Since the blockchain is constantly being replicated across many different points, if one of the points on the blockchain network is attacked or fails, other points on the network will step in and provide identical information.” In other words, counter to what you might expect, that decentralization of data means immediate detection of any funny business.\n\n“The decentralized nature of the blockchain also creates greater data integrity and trust as the data is always being replicated across different points in the system,” said Marks. So, trust, in essence, becomes mute, because no one entity has a unilateral, unchecked power to adjust the ledger. All must accept any change.\n\nRead: How SmartMetric’s Fingerprint Technology Can Prevent Billions in Credit Card Fraud Loss\n\nWhy It Could Mean Faster, Cheaper Banking for You\n\nMarks said that even if you don’t use Bitcoin, blockchain tech could impact you in a major way.\n\n“Some people instantly associate blockchain with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but it extends much further than that. Blockchain technology has the potential to totally change the way we think about transaction history, database storage, security — the list goes on,” Marks said.\n\nSpecifically, Marks said banking customers could be positively impacted by this technology. “With the potential for blockchain to speed up transaction processing, reduce capital requirements, and lower operational risks, they would likely receive higher quality services at a lower cost,” said Marks.\n\nFor example, Marks said consumers could potentially receive benefits including:\n\nNear-instant settlement of funds\n\nLower fees sending money overseas\n\nLower electronic transaction costs\n\nAnd blockchain’s potential impact extends well beyond the banking industry. “It is also being tested in such sectors as healthcare, retail, telecom, and government,” said Marks.\n\nHow Big Banks Are Starting to Use Blockchain Tech\n\nMarks said that although Bitcoin hasn’t had that big of an impact on the banking industry, blockchain technology stands to have an enormous one. Blockchain tech is still in its infancy, said Marks; however, a number of banks are testing its potential in various ways.\n\n“For example, a company called Ripple is working with several top banks to initiate a network for more efficient inter-bank and cross-border payments using the blockchain’s distributed ledger technology,” Marks said.\n\nMarks said you can only expect this technology to be used much more in the future. “All banks, regardless of their size and focus, should consider increasing their engagement with blockchain technology,” he said. That’s because the technology comes with many practical benefits for them. “Blockchain enables near-instant settlement of funds as all parties are looking at the same ledger instead of separate databases or privately stored information,” Marks said.\n\nThat means that the middleman, or central authority, can be cut out of the equation, resulting in lower transaction costs and enabling banks to reduce back office costs. And, as settlement times decrease, less capital reserves are required for banks because part of a bank’s capital requirements are tied to how long an asset sits on its balance sheet, said Marks.\n\nSo, Bitcoin’s founder dreamed of changing the world with a decentralized monetary system, and he just might have done it — just not in the way he envisioned.\n\nRelated: 10 Best National Banks of 2016', ""Jamie McCormick who runs the Bitcoin Marketing Team and BitcoinsInIreland has just released the results of their second annual global survey which took place between April and June 2016 on the uses of Bitcoin. On the question of the active use of Bitcoin 65% said they had sent or received Bitcoin in the last week while 9% of respondents had not yet used it.\n\nThe full results will be published on Thursday afternoon by 3pm GMT on www.bitcoinsinireland.com\n\nJamie McCormick says:\n\n“We’re really happy to publish the report this week, and we hope that people studying, investing or working in the Bitcoin and Blockchain industries find it a useful snapshot of the industry in 2016.”\n\nThe survey results also give a fascinating insight into how Bitcoin users view themselves, what they like and dislike about the digital currency, losing wallets, and exchange usage covering everything from hacks to shutdowns to users gambling habits and the many angles of mining.\n\nHow was the survey carried out?\n\nThe team, which included volunteers from the Irish games industry, Bitcointalk and reddit to help localise the survey into 13 languages, have already laid the groundwork for next year's Bitcoin survey. At the request of community members they are currently looking for partners in the Chinese and Russian Bitcoin media as well as adding Indonesian, Portuguese, Filipino and Indian languages to next year's survey.\n\nIn an attempt to reach as many Bitcoin users as possible the survey was made available in 13 different languages ranging from Chinese to Romanian and gives an insight into the usage and users of the digital currency not seen before.\n\nThere were 1.25 Bitcoin incentives put up against 16 rewards for participants to take part from 0.05 btc to 0.5 btc which were randomly drawn and distributed between the winning respondents throughout the time of the survey.\n\nMcCormick said there were several objectives he was aiming to achieve from this. Some included conducting a primary research project to help guide his own company's development and engage his agency clients and website readers in an attempt to get a global, non-US focused view on how people use Bitcoin around the world.\n\nThey identified the areas they wanted to get information on across 37 questions including demographics, active use of Bitcoin, opinions on wallets, exchanges, gambling, mining, Bitcoin losses and the pros and cons of Bitcoin.\n\nWho were the respondents?\n\nResponses were collected from 68 countries around the world with the majority coming from Europe, North America, South America and South-East Asia.\n\nAge demographics showed respondents ranged from 15 to 71 years old, gender demographics show the industry is still strongly male-dominated with male respondents being 91.8% of the total, females were 5.7%, with 2.5% choosing not to specify.\n\nInvolvement in Bitcoin revealed the majority of respondents have been using Bitcoin from 2013, although there were respondents going back as far as 2009 and as recently as 2016."", 'Pantera Capital partner and chief technology officer Steven Waterhouse has departed the bitcoin and blockchain-focused venture capital firm.\n\nFounded in 2013, Pantera is one of the ecosystem’s largest VC firms, boasting a portfolio that includes some of its biggest success stories, including 21 Inc, Abra and Xapo.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Venezuela is projected to remain in a deep recession in 2016. Compared to contraction rate of 5.7 percent in 2015, 2016 saw a rise of 8 percent.\n\nPolitical uncertainty and the decline in the price of oil are factors affecting macroeconomic imbalances and pressures. The IMF states that inflation in Venezuela is predicted to rise to 500 percent in 2016 and further next year.\n\nIt’s no wonder then that many people recognize the benefits that bitcoin presents for the future and to shield them against further inflation.\n\nRecord Highs of Bitcoin Use\n\nIn the first week of August, bitcoin transactions in Venezuela reached $141.7 million bolivar that was exchanged for bitcoin, amounting to $141 million USD.\n\nAccording to a report, this record beat the previous week’s, which saw $117.116 million bolivar being exchanged for bitcoin. Comparing this to the U.S. Dollar the figure equates to $117 million.\n\nVenezuela’s local currency, the bolivar, doesn’t seem to be on the road to recovery just yet.\n\nOf course, this is good news for the digital currency, bitcoin. It now means that Venezuelans who can’t exchange their currency for others can invest their money in bitcoin.\n\nThe Rise of Bitcoin in Venezuela\n\nDespite the fact that Bloomberg conducted a survey that found Venezuela to be the most miserable economy in the world, bitcoin exchanges are taking a stand to give the people of Venezuela a helping hand.\n\nAt the moment there are three bitcoin exchanges in the country: SurBitcoin, which is the biggest, and Yabit and Cryptobuyer, both of which are relatively new.\n\nAs can be seen, as bitcoin continues to grow it is helping out those countries that need it the most as governments idly sit by inept to do anything to help out the country and its people remove itself out of its recession.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'BlockPay has debuted a zero-fee merchant system with cryptocurrency integration, including Dash.\n\nThe BlockPay is a point-of-sale (POS) system which accepts a wide variety of cryptocurrencies for zero fees, as well as traditional debit and credit cards. Among these is Dash, a cryptocurrency which places a strong emphasis on day-to-day usability, hence the name as a portmanteau of ""digital"" and ""cash.""\n\nCurrently, Dash sits at cryptocurrency number seven as far as market cap, although it likely ranks second only to Bitcoin in terms of use as money, as other currencies like Ethereum, Steem, and Ethereum Classic are largely used for non-money purposes.\n\nLitecoin, one of Bitcoin’s major digital cash competitors boasting an impressive listing of merchants, has largely fallen out of use, and many of those merchants no longer accept it as payment.\n\nBuy a pint with Dash\n\nEase of use is key to a currency’s adoption, and adoption is the best way to ensure its long-term viability. Dash is already accepted at over 60 merchants worldwide. It can easily be converted to Bitcoin via ShapeShift (especially easy through the Coinomi wallet, for example) when necessary.\n\nFeatures like InstantX zero-confirmation transactions (as tested with the Dash N’ Drink vending machine) make the cryptocurrency primed for everyday transactions. The addition of a POS system that not only accepts Dash, but accepts Bitcoin as well (allowing businesses to “kill two birds with one stone”), only promises to hasten Dash’s worldwide acceptance.\n\nEvan Duffield, Dash’s founder, notes how the cryptocurrency and the technology surrounding it are growing up:\n\n""We\'re very happy to see our ecosystem growing naturally and integrating very important functionality such as POS systems. This will make it very easy for evolution users to spend their Dash (and many other currencies as well!) at locations all over the world.""\n\nIn the typical go-to example of real-world use, it is possible to buy a pint of beer with Dash, as was recently demonstrated at a beer garden in Munich.\n\nAnother step in solidifying true currency competition\n\nThe addition of a robust POS system that doesn’t force a “Bitcoin or nothing” approach to practical cryptocurrency use is yet another step towards providing true competition in the cryptocurrency world, allowing every bit of adoption ground gained by Bitcoin to be shared by its competitors.\n\nSeveral alternative currencies other than Dash have already gained ground in adoption. Scotcoin, a Scottish cryptocurrency, is currently accepted at about a dozen merchants, including the proverbial “pint for crypto.”\n\nNetherlands-based cryptocurrency Gulden is accepted at 55 retailers worldwide, and utilizing the Nocks app allows Gulden to be seamlessly converted to Bitcoin for transactions, giving the illusion of paying with Gulden.\n\nMeanwhile Bitcoin’s blocks have increasingly become full, delaying transactions which require at least one confirmation before processing.\n\nWith increasing options for alternative cryptocurrencies to be used with ease, this added pressure could prompt the Bitcoin community to develop a solution to the block size issue, or else lose ground to competing currencies.', 'Article repeats a lot of the knowns on QC such as bit v. Qubit; and finally provides some good info on pros and cons of Bitcoin and Lamport signatures technique with QC. However, the author didn’t seem to mention any of the work that D-Wave for example is doing with Block chaining. Also, I saw no mention of the work by Oxford on the logic gate which improve both the information processing performance and the security of information transmissions.\n\nIn a classical computer bits are used that can either be 0 or 1. In a quantum computer these bits are replaced with Qubits (quantum bits). These Qubits can be 0 or 1, or both at the same time. This is caused by a phenomenon in the quantum realm called superposition. At scales the size of an atom and small molecules, the spin of particles is not determined until it is observed. A pair of Qubits can be in any quantum superposition of 4 states, and three Qubits in any superposition of 8 states. In general, a quantum computer with n Qubits can be in a superposition of up to 2^n different states simultaneously (this compares to a normal computer that can only be in one of these 2^n states at any one time). Because of this, a quantum computer is able to perform computations at the same time, while classical computers perform computations one at a time.\n\nThis effectively means that the computing power grows exponentially for each Qubit you add to the system. A quantum computer will be able to make really difficult calculations all the classical computers in the world together would not be able to do before the end of times, in a relatively short amount of time. This opens to world of computing to be able to perform amazingly complex calculations, such as weather or large scale quantum mechanics, with extremely high precision. Unfortunatly, it will also be great at cracking certain types of cryptography.\n\nRead more', 'Kim Dotcom is re-launching his Megaupload platform in early 2017. At the same time, he will reveal a mysterious blockchain powered project called Bitcache. If you have been following the developments recently then you likely already know that. What you may not know is that Dotcom has been talking about his “next” project for over a year, and he has dropped a few hints here and there in the interim.\n\nTrying to piece those hints together leaves a frustrating amount still unanswered. Half the time, it is impossible to know if Dotcom is serious or trolling. We do know a few facts. Dotcom says it will be a mass online storage solution. Bitcache will use Bitcoin micropayments. and user privacy will be protected using encryption. He also claims that his technology will solve Bitcoin’s scaling problems, a lofty promise indeed.\n\nA little history for those who haven’t been following the case. Kim Dotcom launched Megaupload in 2005. At its peak it had over 50,000,000 daily users, before 2012 when the US Government seized the site. For years after, Dotcom fought extradition to the United States from New Zealand and eventually won. His assets were also seized, but he was able to wrestle back control for at least some of it.\n\nBeyond the small tibits Dotcom has released, little is known about his upcoming project. We have trolled through his twitter account and read every article Dotcom has seen fit to retweet (he does that a lot) trying to figure out exactly what Dotcom has planned for bitcoin and cloud storage. Here are three interesting but under-covered hints and facts Dotcom has dropped.\n\n(1) There are three Dotcom projects going on now.\n\nDotcom made it clear in a recent tweet that the Bitchache project is not Megaupload 2.0 or the MegaNET program he started hyping last year. They will all connect together though. Megaupload 2.0 seems to be an evolution of the original Megaupload. Bitcache is less clear but involves cryptocurrency micropayments in some way.\n\n1. Megaupload 2.0 2. Bitcache 3. MegaNet — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) August 5, 2016\n\nThe most ambitious of the three though, is MegaNET, which has been described as a decentralized internet. It sounds like it will use mesh networks and your phone’s unused processing power and storage. Users won’t have a traditional IP address.\n\nIn order to make Mesh Networks work effectively on a large scale, it’ll need a critical mass of user adoption, which is apparently what Megaupload 2.0 and Bitcache are designed to attract.\n\n@FR33_W0RLD MegaNet needs instant critical mass coz the network is carried by its users. MU2 will provide that critical mass. — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) August 8, 2016\n\n(2) Demon Saw May Play a Role\n\nDemon Saw is a unique file sharing program that seems to involve some of the features Kim Dotcom wants to include in his projects. Its creator and Kim Dotcom have recently spent some time together at Defcon and proclaimed they would change the world.\n\nA posed picture together is hardly an announcement, even if Dotcom did retweet it, but the similarities of their projects make it worth paying attention to. Demon Saw is retro in its design and function. As a long time member of the internet underground, it reminds me of early, pre- Napster, pre-torrenting file sharing services like Hotline Connect and Direct Connect. Like those programs and like Dotcom’s MegaNET, Demon Saw is separate from the traditional internet.\n\nLike Hotline Connect, users decide if they want to be a Client or a Server. Clients can download any file put into designated folders on the Servers’ computers. Users can make “Groups” so that activities aren’t taking place in public.\n\nDemon Saw is not yet open source, a point of contention in its still in its infancy community. Could it be that Dotcom doesn’t want him to reveal trade secrets until Megaupload 2.0 is ready?\n\n(3) Despite all the Red Flags, I still want to invest.\n\nDotcom has maintained that the project will turn into something crowdfunded. It appears he is going to go through with that, using BankToTheFuture as his platform.\n\nThe #Bitcoin community seems excited about Bitcache.@BankToTheFuture and I are working on a limited share offer. Coming this August 🔑💰 — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) August 9, 2016\n\nWhile Dotcom is saying it will be open sourced, we know almost nothing about the project at the current moment. Investing would essentially be putting all your trust into one man: Kim Dotcom.\n\nKim Dotcom is the sole reason to invest in his upcoming projects, never a good sign. Investing in crypto projects is like playing the lottery: you are probably going to lose. So investing in a project that is dependent on one man is even more risky. Concerns that are deepened by Dotcom’s continued false insistence that he invented two factor authentication. It is rarely a good sign when your inventor is claiming to invent things he didn’t invent. (Dotcom holds a patent in the EU and US on 2FA, but it was predated by patents held by AT&T and publicly available work.)\n\nHe is also making lofty promises that seem out of his reach. He claims his program will solve Bitcoin’s scaling problems. I have my doubts. Big issues are rarely solved by one feature or idea. More often, the solution is revealed slowly, by a bunch of people working together. Satoshi did not solve Byzantine General alone. Wei Dai and Nick Sazbo had major contributions to the solution long before Satoshi appeared on the scene. There are hundreds of people with really high IQs working on the problem together. Will Dotcom come in fix everything by himself? Again, I have my doubts.\n\nBut with all that said, and despite the sale breaking several of my cardinal sins, I still want in. Former users still have fond memories of Megaupload. There is no reason to think he won’t do it again. Kim’s successful launch of Mega.co.nz proves he is not a one-hit wonder. No cloud storage or file sharing solution has matched Megaupload’s original success. Dotcom is swinging for the fences this time, targeting not just file sharing but online reward structures and the internet itself as w ell. Whereas Megaupload was a Web 2.0 company, Megaupload 2.0, Bitcache and MegaNET might create a whole new genre of what it means to be online. Web 3.0.', 'Bitit is a French Bitcoin startup which keeps reinventing itself. After making a big splash by letting users buy Bitcoin through a Bitit code redeemable into Bitcoins, and with cash in 100K+ local stores, Bitit is now proposing a new killer platform which lets you buy Bitcoins in few seconds.\n\nThis is a story in the making for a startup which has big product ambitions and wants to play a major role in the cryptocurrency space. Bitit is starting from scratch again and is rethinking its Bitcoin buying platform service.\n\nNicolas Katan, Founder of Bitit, says:\n\n“The first digital goods that we sold were Bitcoin. We chose Bitcoin because it’s a low hanging fruit where there is more market depth, more transactions and where needs are the most recurrent.”\n\nMeeting demand for seamless Bitcoin purchase\n\nFrom it’s start nearly 8 months ago Bitit had processed more than half millions euros, user growth exceeded expectations, and the company spent a lot of time addressing feature requests.\n\nAvailable in more than 50 countries (and counting) the company now have stronger partnerships with payment institutions and processors. Bitit is now ready to embrace the demand for a seamless Bitcoin purchase.\n\nKatan tells CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Leaving the prepaid gift card aspect allowed us to build a platform which is perfectly in line with our vision. We allow individuals and institutions to buy any digital tokens at any time within seconds.”\n\nThe company will be limiting credit/debit card purchases to 500€ worth of Bitcoin per week, compared to $10,000 per week when buying Bitcoin with cash through Neosurf prepaid voucher.\n\nLast but not least, there is no identity verification for your first 25€ Bitcoin purchase, which is really appealing for Bitcoin enthusiasts who want to buy their first Bitcoin. Also all Bitit users can earn points and redeem them to save on their Bitcoin purchase.\n\nProcessing high risks transactions\n\nBitit has specialized int processing high risks transactions. Selling Bitcoin by credit card is not as easy as selling any other e-commerce goods.\n\nUgo Mare CTO at Bitit, says:\n\n“Bitit has to know and identify each of our customers above and beyond what is required for compliance as it is the only way for security, excellence and the highest quality of services for our customers.”\n\nThis is key to understanding Bitit’s approach. By intellectually routing transactions and understanding the risk model for online transactions, Bitit increases the profitability for each customer by inherently increasing their life-time value.\n\nNew financial services\n\nBitit have 3 distribution channels, but the company is now creating new financial services where third parties can add a Bitit functionality into their websites and applications. It allows users to buy Bitcoin directly on third-party websites.\n\nBitit is acting like a credit card processor, but with one more thing: they promptly deliver Bitcoin to a user wallet. Bitit has already closed an undisclosed partnership with a well-known Bitcoin platform, and they will release the functionality in the next weeks.\n\nCurrently the company is in negotiation with new distribution network specialists to launch cash-for-Bitcoin, buying in more than 200K+ convenience stores around the world. They are also gaining interest from those distribution network specialists to add the Bitit gift card on their network.\n\nChris Marcilla Head of Risk Management at Bitit, explains:\n\n“Our Risk Management Platform (RMP) is our prime tool to use everyday in order to improve integrity, accuracy, credibility and security of our operations.”\n\nThe Paris based team of five will raise a seed round in the coming months. But the product is already very impressive. The design and technology behind Bitit already make it a serious Bitcoin buying platform contender.', 'The state of California is once again moving forward with legislation that would update its money transmitter rules to capture businesses engaged in digital currency activities.\n\nDeemed inactive last September, Assembly Bill 1326 was re-introduced by the legislature this week and has since been read and amended. Given the discussion that surrounded earlier versions of the bill, the update is already being scrutinized, though signs suggest pros and cons remain.\n\nMost notably, the bill no longer proposes to license businesses engaged in financial applications of the technology, but would instead create a new Digital Currency Business Enrollment Program. Lasting five years, the proposed program appears focused on helping the state learn more about the emerging technology.\n\nAccording to the bill, companies that store, transmit, exchange or issue digital currency qualify as digital currency businesses and would be required to pay a non-refundable $5,000 fee to participate in the program, a cost equal to the New York BitLicense application fee.\n\nIn addition, there is a continuing cost of $2,500 annually, and the text proposes giving the program commissioner the authority to impose ""a claim for civil penalties"" of up to $25,000.\n\nThe revised text reads:\n\n""The bill would prohibit a person from engaging in the digital currency business without enrolling in the program and would prohibit the conduct of digital currency business through an unenrolled agent.""\n\nElsewhere, the bill includes new definitions for digital currency, labelling the technology a ""digital representation of value"".\n\nConcerns raised\n\nDue to certain revisions and vague wordings, the bill text has drawn early critics.\n\nOne person who helped consult California\'s Assembly Banking and Finance Committee leading up to the bill\'s amendment said that in spite of the softer language, other changes could result in even harsher requirements.\n\nDigital currency lawyer and research director for non-profit Coin Center, Peter Van Valkenburgh, told CoinDesk:\n\n""We like that it\'s enrollment, but we don’t like that because there’s such a big penalty, that it\'s essentially a license — and we don\'t like that there\'s so many kinds of companies that could potentially be subject.""\n\nAccording to Van Valkenburgh, the non-profit advocacy group supports requiring licensing of a business or individual if they are in a ""position of trust"" with their customers. Those who will be required to enroll in this program don’t necessarily qualify, he said.\n\nVan Valkenburgh joins multiple other skeptics in expressing concern over the bill.\n\nQuestions of control\n\nAmbiguities in the terms of who would be subject to the bill open up the door for what Van Valkenburgh believes constitutes unnecessary control.\n\nOther examples he was concerned about included the potential inclusion of sidechains and cross-chain atomic swaps under the exchanges category and the definitions of what it means to transmit and custody a digital currency.\n\nIn particular, he says that that lack of bonding requirements and specific consumer protections at this early stage, along with the time limit on the measure that would see its provisions expire in January 2021, shows an open-mindedness to the rapidly changing nature of the industry.\n\n""By not mandating a particular form of consumer protections the enrollment seems to show a certain amount of humility by the regulators,"" said Van Valkenburgh.\n\nStill, he emphasized the change amounted to a ""radical shift"" away from the direction he believed the state was heading.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""What’s important to keep in mind is that the language we were dealing with last year is almost entirely different than this year. So something major has changed.""\n\nThe bill\'s author, Matthew Dababneh of California\'s 45th District, was not immediately available for comment.\n\nImage credit: Lukasz Stefanski / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

08/11/2016,"['NEW YORK (Reuters) - TradeZero, a Bahamas-based online broker-dealer, said on Thursday it had launched the world’s first “dark pool” exchange for bitcoin to enable institutional investors to execute large trades.\n\nThe company will eventually open the exchange to other digital currencies such as ether and litecoin.\n\nTradeZero has partnered with Jered Kenna, one of the earliest bitcoin investors and founder of the now defunct bitcoin exchange called Tradehill, for the venture.\n\nDark pools refer to trading outside the exchange done by large institutional investors. Off-exchange trading can make up about 40 percent of all U.S. stock trades.\n\n“We are looking to provide the non-U.S. investor with the same access, tools and discounted commission structure that many U.S. traders enjoy today,” said Daniel Pipitone, director of TradeZero said in a statement.\n\nThe company said customers will get access commission-free dark pool digital currency trading, allowing them to make large purchases or sales without substantially moving the market price.\n\nTradeZero already allows commission-free stock and ETF trading, as well as equity and index options.\n\n“If you want to see larger players moving in to do larger trades in bitcoin without upsetting the market, a dark pool is necessary,” bitcoin entrepreneur Kenna told Reuters in an interview.\n\n“I think it will bring a lot of stability in the market as well.”\n\nHe said there is currently a required minimum opening balance of $10,000 to be able to trade on the dark pool exchange.\n\nKenna said when he launched TradeHill in the early days of bitcoin, the exchange offered a dark pool, but the company was never able to fund a bank to act as custodian for the fiat currencies, dollars and euro, arising from the bitcoin trades.\n\nTradeZero will use a pre-existing bank for the fiat currencies, but Kenna declined to disclose the name of the bank.\n\nKenna was one of the earliest and larger holders of bitcoin. His initial purchase of 5,000 coins was for 20 cents each.\n\nOn Thursday, bitcoin traded at $589.81.', ""Bitcoin may be the new big thing in global currencies, but don't count on it replacing the old, boring store of value, now or ever.\n\nNew paradigms often create market bubbles. They are a new technology or idea that will change the world and, along the way, offer investors unlimited profits.\n\nMania soon takes hold as prices detach from reality and people get rich, at least on paper. The mania soon fades, though, and before long prices fall, sometimes dramatically.\n\nThe cryptocurrency bitcoin is a good example of this new paradigm thinking. Bitcoin is a digital currency that is created and held electronically.\n\nAt its core is the blockchain, a super database that tracks all bitcoin transactions. Some of its fans think that soon bitcoin use will grow exponentially and offer unlimited profits to investors.\n\nThey think that bitcoin will become the gold of the digital era, a safe place to park cash whenever there is a financial crisis and which is beyond the printing press threat of paper currency.\n\nBitcoin proponents say that it is similar to the Internet in the 1990s and personal computers in the late 1970s. It is a disruptive technology about to go mainstream.\n\nAnd as investors abandon paper currencies, a tsunami of money will chase bitcoins as a safe-haven global currency, sending prices for the limited number of bitcoins available soaring.\n\nThe bubble in bitcoin prices, which rose from $215 last summer to a high of $763 this summer, reflects the exuberance.\n\nIt could also show the impact that Chinese traders are having on bitcoin, as 90% of all bitcoin transactions happen in China, and much of bitcoin's price volatility is due to China-based short-term traders.\n\nIn market bubbles, the mania phase eventually turns into the fourth and final blow-off phase. This is when paper fortunes and big gains disappear.\n\nSince its June 16 high, bitcoin has dropped 24%, which we flagged as a possibility at around the same time. So, bitcoin has likely already started the blow-off phase, and lower prices could be on the way.\n\nA new, more realistic view of bitcoin is taking hold. Bitcoin has become the realm of speculators, and isn't a legitimate currency.\n\nThere are still a lot of obstacles to it becoming mainstream.\n\nAnd last week's news of hackers stealing $70 million worth of bitcoin from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, a bitcoin exchange, also highlighted one of the biggest concerns about bitcoin: that it has a hacking problem.\n\nThe same day that news of the bitcoin hack/heist surfaced, global investment bank Credit Suisse released a report on bitcoin and its blockchain technology."", 'Bitcoin price could be in for a selloff now that it broke below the short-term channel support and is testing the next inflection point.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price was previously trending higher on its short-term time frames, moving inside an ascending channel visible on the 30-min and 1-hour charts.\n\nPrice was rejected on its test of resistance and made its way back down to the channel support as expected.\n\nHowever, this floor broke down, signaling that a reversal from the uptrend may be in order.\n\nBitcoin price could be in for a selloff now that it broke below the short-term channel support and is testing the next inflection point.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is still above the longer-term 200 SMA so there could be a chance for a bounce. However, price has already dipped below the dynamic support at the 100 SMA and looks ready to break below the 200 SMA as well, setting the stage for a potential downward crossover later on.\n\nStochastic is deep in the oversold region, which means that sellers are starting to get exhausted. The oscillator has yet to cross higher and make its way out of the oversold area before it indicates a return in buying momentum. If a bounce takes place, bitcoin price could simply retest the broken channel support around $590 before resuming its drop.\n\nMarket Events\n\nUS equities ended in the green once more, renewing demand for the dollar versus other assets such as bitcoin. Economic reports from the US have been surpassing expectations these days, keeping hopes up for a Fed interest rate hike in September or December.\n\nUS retail sales data are up for release today and analysts are expecting to see a 0.4% increase in the headline figure and a 0.2% uptick for the core version of the report, both weaker than the previous 0.6% and 0.7% gains respectively. However, if the actual readings beat expectations, the US dollar could gain more traction in its climb.\n\nOn the other hand, downbeat consumer spending data could dash hopes of a Fed rate hike before the end of the year, renewing demand for alternative assets such as bitcoin. Zooming out to longer-term time frames shows that the uptrend might still be intact, keeping bitcoin price on track for more upside later on.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Once the network is stable after the hard fork, we will re-enable all ETH deposits and withdrawals.”\n\nHowever, the hard fork led to the creation of Ethereum Classic, a network devoted to the development and maintenance of the Ethereum network’s original chain. With the market cap and trading volume of ETC increasing due to the support of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges including Poloniex and Kraken, the Korbit team came to a decision to become the first major Bitcoin exchange in Korea to support Ethereum Classic.\n\nAll ETC trades will be free of cost\n\nMore importantly, as a celebration of their new trading feature, the Korbit team announced that all ETC trades will be free of cost, eliminating exchange and conversion fees for all users for a while.\n\nThe Korbit team said:\n\n“Korbit’s Ethereum Classic-Korean Won (ETC-KRW) Exchange has finally launched. Now, you can directly trade ETC with KRW on Korbit Exchange. Similar to our BTC-KRW Exchange, you can trade ETC by setting your own price in a full order book and deposit ETC via our website to trade ETC. To celebrate its opening, you can trade ETC without fees for a while.”\n\nKorbit, one of the two venture capital-backed Bitcoin exchanges in Korea, currently controls the majority of the market share in the Korean cryptocurrency market, with exceptionally high daily volumes and orders.\n\nWith their full support towards Ethereum Classic, other major Korean exchanges are highly likely to launch Ethereum Classic trading in the near future.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

That ransom is almost always paid in bitcoin, too, as it\'s extremely difficult for the police to track.\n\nRansomware is best known for infecting individual computers, but Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of cybersecurity company Malwarebytes, told Business Insider that he has seen a rise in businesses affected by ransomware.\n\n""In the last six to 12 months, this has just gone so aggressively to the business environment,"" Kleczynski says. ""We see companies from 25 people all the way to 250,000 people getting hit with ransomware.""\n\nAn Osterman research survey sponsored by Malwarebytes shows that 54% of businesses surveyed had come under attack from ransomware in the last 12 months. The survey contacted 540 companies, and it found that the most commonly targeted types of business were in the healthcare or finance industries.\n\nKleczynski says that banks are starting to prepare for the threat of ransomware as the frequency of attacks increases. ""I talked to a couple of banks and they say they have 50-100 bitcoin ready at all times in a wallet to deploy if a ransomware attack hits,"" he said.\n\nHaving 50-100 bitcoins on hand isn\'t a small sum — it\'s between £22,000 and £44,000. But banks need that money ready to go if a ransomware attack holds critical files to ransom. Not paying the criminals could result in an even bigger loss.\n\nBanks are clearly ready to pay up to get rid of ransomware, but is it a good idea? We asked Kleczynski whether businesses should pay up. ""Lives should never be at stake,"" he said. ""But if they are, for whatever reason, I would pay the ransom. It’s just money ... If you’re a student who has been working on something for four years and don’t have a backup of your PHD thesis, again, it might be appropriate to pay the ransom. But if you have just some family photos that are recoverable from the camera, I would not pay the ransom.""\n\nThe reason for the sudden rise in the number of ransomware attacks is a combination of a low cost to develop ransomware, and the possibility of a far higher payback from targets. Kleczynski says that ""ransomware is very cost-effective. You pay $5 to infect let’s say potentially 1,000 people. If all 1,000 people pay you just spent $5 plus whatever it cost you to build this malware, and you’ve made tens of thousands. Trying to serve any other type of malware is a losing game.""', 'About The Author\n\nEduardo Gómez is a Computer Science Major from Venezuela, a country with a loyal Bitcoin user base.

You can read their round-up of my claims here.\n\nMy reporting on every aspect of that story is sound and well sourced. Barry Silbert\'s Digital Currency Group did indeed buy out CoinDesk earlier in the year, and CoinDesk\'s coverage of Ethereum since that acquisition has shifted to a degree that is ""discernible.""\n\nBarry Silbert, previously an investor focused only on Bitcoin, has exploited the resources of his name and platform to promote Classic, despite the fact that it is arguably useless - an insecure orphan chain with insufficient hash rate to guarantee long-term network health. At time of publication, Classic has a trifling 647.3 GH/s hash rate, whereas the main Ethereum chain is running at around 4,404.6 GH/s.\n\nSilbert was indeed investigated by the S.E.C. and subsequently forced to disgorge some of his firm\'s gains in connection to a prior project, BIT Shares; I linked to the S.E.C.\'s case law file in that piece. It\'s not my ""opinion"" that Mr. Silbert faced regulatory scrutiny - it is simple reality and a matter in the public record.\n\nI own only two cryptographic assets, Ether and Bitcoin, and have never held more than US $10,000 of any ""alt coin"" project I have covered, making it awfully difficult for critics to brand me as a ""pumper"" - although deflection and ad hominem are common enough tactics when a wealthy man is questioned by the media.\n\nDuring a RT America broadcast a couple years ago, I suggested that viewers ""Go out and buy some Dogecoin,"" a moment frequently used to brand me as an alt coin pumper. Of course my detractors don\'t ever tell the full story: that was clearly a joke if you watched the full segment. I was being interviewed by a friend, former RT host Abby Martin, and we were discussing how cryptocurrency is a more valid technology, in my view, than centrally issued fiat currencies. My argument was that in contrast to the absurdity of central banking, even going out and buying some silly Dogecoin makes more sense. At that time, and at every other time in my life, I have not held any Dogecoin - I didn\'t find its economics or community to be compelling enough.\n\nSeparately, yesterday\'s reveal that Swiss financial services giant UBS is working with Ethereum and will soon be making an announcement was, and is, well sourced. Other multinational banks are expected to announce involvement with the Ethereum protocol, but since their discussions with The Huffington Post have been off the record, I will not be sharing details of those projects until the firms themselves choose to do so - or until their involvement becomes public knowledge through independently sourced pieces elsewhere.\n\nFor what it\'s worth, Barry Silbert appears as publicly committed to Ethereum Classic as ever:\n\nDisclosure: At time of publication, I hold some bitcoin, ether, U.S. dollars, and gold in my long term portfolio.']"
08/12/2016,"[""This is attractive because blockchains — or “distributed ledgers,” as they are often described — could offer a new way to move money and track transactions across borders and other networks in a more secure, transparent and effective way than the current system.\n\nDistributed ledgers are often viewed as most attractive to industries with businesses that lack a central institution they can trust to keep their records.\n\nThe World Economic Forum report notes that most developments are likely to happen behind the scenes. So consumers won’t see the changes to infrastructure, but the changes could lead to cheaper and faster financial services. The report says the technology could help improve both mainstream transactions, like global payments and stock trading, and lesser-known areas like trade finance and contingent convertible bonds.\n\nThe 130-page report from the forum is the product of a year of research and five gatherings of executives from several major institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Visa, MasterCard and BlackRock.\n\nThe report estimates that 80 percent of banks around the world could start distributed ledger projects by next year. Large central banks are also studying how the blockchain will alter the way money moves around the globe.\n\nListen: ‘Bitcoin Divided,’ From Planet Money The writer, Nathaniel Popper, joined NPR’s Planet Money to explore how a behind-the-scenes fight over Bitcoin spilled out into the real world. You can also hear this episode on iTunes.\n\nMost banks have already put together blockchain working groups and released research reports hailing the potentially transformative effect of the technology.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut few real-world uses of the blockchain have come to fruition, other than Bitcoin itself. That has led to some questions about whether the blockchain is the proverbial solution looking for a problem, rather than an innovation that will be used widely.\n\nExisting virtual currencies have continued to struggle with security problems. One of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Bitfinex, recently lost more than $60 million worth of Bitcoin in a hacking — the latest of several such incidents.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In addition to the technology issues, the report says that the industry will have to work with governments to create standard rules and laws to govern transactions.\n\nThe report does not make a single mention of Bitcoin. That mirrors the pronouncements from banks, which have often said that they can harness distributed ledgers without using existing virtual currencies. Rather, these ledgers would be run by groups of institutions that want to keep common records.\n\nJust this week, 15 global banks, including Wells Fargo and UBS, said that they had completed a prototype of a distributed ledger that could track trade financing around the globe — providing a single record for a series of scattered, hard-to-track transactions."", 'Mexico’s third-largest Bitcoin exchange, MeXBT, has gone offline without any prior warning – leaving its users confused.\n\nThe firm’s website has gone and now just says “the page you are looking for cannot be found”. Its Twitter account is slightly more helpful and says (in Spanish) the platform has been suspended temporarily and it needs to make revisions to its operations.\n\nThere is no indication as to whether there has been a hacking incident. It is not clear when or if operations will resume.\n\nMeXBT was founded in 2013 and the firm’s HQ is in Mexico City. It also says it is “based out” of Shanghai, New Delhi and Singapore.\n\nAdvertise here\n\nThis latest incident is not a great advert for Bitcoin as on 8 August it all went wrong in Hong Kong; when about $72 million worth of Bitcoin was stolen from the Bitfinex exchange platform.\n\nNearly 120,000 units were pilfered making it the second-biggest security breach ever of such an exchange.\n\nBitfinex is one of the largest exchanges for Bitcoin, and according to Reuters is known in the digital currency community for having a platform that has deep liquidity in the US dollar/Bitcoin currency pair.\n\nThe firm is still in the process of bringing the platform online in a “controlled and secure way”.\n\nBitfinex also has to look for new funding to compensate its customers.\n\nUPDATE 15 August 2016\n\nThe firm’s website no longer displays “the page you are looking for cannot be found”. Instead, a message (in Spanish) says:\n\n“Dear Users:\n\n“We are making a temporary suspension for a review of operations meXBT exchange.\n\n“All accounts of our users remain on the same terms and will resume consultations, deposits and withdrawals as meXBT operation is restored.\n\n“All questions of our users may be directed to informes@mexbt.com.”', ""The past couple months have been quite the roller coaster in the world of public blockchains. $125 million has been stolen and the communities of Bitcoin and Ethereum have been scrambling to pick up the pieces.\n\nFirst there was the $50m Ether heist from The DAO, a company which had raised over $150 million based on the premise that its management was a distributed autonomous organization. Now the Bitcoin community is faced with a $75 million loss from what was the largest exchange, Bitfinex. The thefts are roughly the same size, but there have been two completely different reactions from their respective communities. Understanding these reactions are very important when thinking how to leverage one of these blockchains.\n\nIn my article, “Why The Bitcoin Blockchain Matters For Your Company Or Startup”, I explained the 4 main value additions a blockchain can provide as an infrastructure. The most important attribute of a blockchain I mentioned was asset settlement, the ability to directly move value nearly instantly and almost for free. This is something that has implications in the world of global payments and beyond with far superior transfer speeds and costs, but for the time being, this can only be done with payments through public blockchains.\n\nThe first blockchain is open, public, and its tokens are worth over $9 billion. This is the system that runs Bitcoin, and it has drawn over $1 billion in additional infrastructure investment in addition to its market capitalization. At the time of this writing, the Bitcoin blockchain is the only system that is secure enough and has the needed liquidity to run live commercial applications, such as our international wage payment & payment processor, Bitwage.\n\nHow can we view the Bitcoin blockchain as secure if $75 million was just stolen from the top exchange? Simple - the hack was not based on a fault in the blockchain itself, it had to do with the security of the exchange’s software and password management. You wouldn't stop using the dollar just because one bank was robbed, right? The same principal applies here."", 'For years, Tian Jia made the kind of returns on his money that investors in the rest of the world could only dream of.\n\nThe 29-year-old Beijing-based programmer had $US440,000 on deposit at the Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Bitfinex until last week and, on good days, would wake up to find a couple thousand more dollars in his account than when he went to sleep. The earnings came from lending his dollars to traders who wanted to leverage their bets. The exchange allowed lenders like Tian to set their own rates, and he says margin traders paid as much as 700 per cent annualised interest to borrow dollars. At times, he earned as much in one day as holders of US Treasuries earn in a decade.\n\n""The returns were really great,"" Tian said. ""Bitfinex was quite innovative and among the first to come out with products including margin lending.""\n\nThat lucrative practice came to a stunning halt last week after Bitfinex said it was hacked for 119,756 bitcoins, worth about $US70 million at current prices. While his US dollars were not stolen, Tian is being forced to forfeit 36 per cent of his deposit – about $US160,000 – as part of a rescue plan the exchange is imposing on all its customers. He said that will more than wipe out the profits he made through lending money.\n\nSHARE\n\nShare on Facebook SHARE\n\nShare on Twitter TWEET\n\nLink Bitcoin exchanges could still face legal liabilities.\n\nBitfinex, which was the largest bitcoin exchange for US dollar trading before the attack, says leaning on its users to cover the loss is the best way to avoid insolvency that would tie up deposits with legal proceedings for years. The exchange hopes to repay the lost money: Customers are receiving tokens that Bitfinex says will one day be redeemable for shares in its parent company, which would give its customers a stake in future profits.\n\nThe unusual proposal has triggered legal consultations and soul-searching for Tian and others like him. Whether they accept the exchange\'s offer or fire back with lawsuits will determine the latest chapter in bitcoin\'s colourful history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n""Some users are still reaching out to lawyers to weigh their options, but going through litigation does mean a lot of risks,"" Tian said. ""The losses aren\'t as bad as I initially expected, but there are still a lot of questions regarding the method of compensation.""\n\nAmong the unanswered questions: How did Bitfinex calculate the 36 per cent haircut? Is the exchange itself shouldering any losses? What are the legal guarantees that the new tokens will be redeemable in the future? The exchange did not reply to multiple inquiries from Bloomberg. The tokens, which were issued at a total value of about $US70 million, immediately fell to about $US21 million in their trading debut Thursday on Bitfinex.\n\nThe discount suggests little confidence in the exchange\'s future. ""Bitfinex has to prove that it can survive first,"" said Peter Ng, a Hong Kong-based user who is facing more than $US200,000 in losses. ""We need to see how transparent the company is going forward. If you lose trust, then you lose your customers.""\n\nStill, he says he had feared even worse. In February 2014, Tokyo-based Mt Gox – then the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange – announced that $US480 million was stolen by hackers and filed for bankruptcy weeks later. Its users are still waiting for liquidators to return a fraction of the deposits that did not disappear.\n\nLitigation against Bitfinex could also drag out since Hong Kong, like most countries, has little legal infrastructure in place for regulating bitcoin exchanges or protecting owners of digital currencies. The city\'s central bank has said bitcoin falls outside its authority. KC Chan, the secretary for financial services and the treasury, has said the government doesn\'t yet see a need for legislation.\n\nBitcoin exchanges could still face legal liabilities under general anti-money laundering laws, and bitcoin transactions may be subject to rules on commodity trading, according to the law firm Kobre & Kim. Customers may also try to recover funds based on claims of negligence or manipulation on the part of the exchange, according to Jef Klazen, a New York-based partner at the firm.\n\n""If your account wasn\'t actually hacked but received this 36 per cent haircut, you might be able to pursue a legal claim on the theory that Bitfinex misappropriated your funds because it made a unilateral decision to take money out of your account,"" Klazen said. Still, he says a lot will depend on what kind of legal contracts users signed with Bitfinex when opening accounts. He reviewed the terms and conditions on the exchange\'s website and thinks that disputes may need to be resolved using an arbitrator selected by the exchange.\n\n""Depending on what jurisdiction you\'re trying to sue in, a court might view that as foreclosing your ability to pursue a lawsuit,"" said Klazen.\n\nWhile security experts have stressed for years that users should minimise deposits at bitcoin exchanges – a painful lesson from Mt Gox – many ignored that advice due to Bitfinex\'s unique margin lending system. The platform allowed traders to multiply the size of their bets by borrowing money, but the practice required both lenders and borrowers to keep their funds at the exchange. That made it a prime target for hackers.\n\nAmong those who borrowed heavily is 34-year-old Zhuo Shuoji. The Beijing-based trader says his annualised borrowing rates were usually less than 10 per cent, but would jump to extraordinary levels when bitcoin volatility rose. Despite the high cost, he says he made good profits until the hack. Now, he just wants to get back whatever money he can.\n\n""The key is for us to get our remaining funds back first,"" said Zhuo, adding that he is facing about $US700,000 in potential losses. ""Then we need to see that this exchange can remain in operation for the tokens to have any value.""\n\nThe risk for Bitfinex is that if too many customers like Zhou pull their money out and don\'t come back, profits from trading fees and margin lending will tumble, throwing into question the exchange\'s plan to earn back the loss over time. Still, Bitfinex\'s ability to begin restoring operations, defend against follow-up attacks, and keep users from completely giving up hope has earned it some credibility.\n\n""The way the whole thing was handled is already an improvement compared with older cases where either the exchange went bust or let users shoulder all the loss,"" said Tian. ""They found a middle way and solutions created could become a road map for the future.""\n\nBloomberg', 'TradeZero, an online securities brokerage that offers free stock trading software, has launched what it claims is the first “dark pool” exchange for bitcoin to allow institutional traders to execute large bitcoin trades outside of the bitcoin exchanges, according to Reuters.\n\nOff-exchange trading can represent 40 percent of all U.S. stock trades.\n\nThe Bahamas-based company will eventually include other digital currencies such as Litecoin and Ether.TradeZero also provides commission-free trading of stocks, equities, index options and ETFs.\n\nTradeZero also provides commission-free trading of stocks, equities, index options, and ETFs.\n\nFund Accounts with Bitcoin or Fiat\n\nTradeZero can fund accounts with bitcoin or any national fiat currency, according to the company’s website.

This allows the system to be entirely trustless and decentralized, but also presents significant drawbacks. Privacy and fungibility are at odds, because public transactions allow anyone to trace the flow of bitcoins over the blockchain. Meanwhile, verifying a growing number of transactions adds to the cost of running a node, which could be a centralizing force.\n\nBut perhaps these drawbacks can be tackled. Last week, a new white paper was somewhat mysteriously dropped on a Bitcoin research channel, written by the pseudonymous author “Tom Elvis Jedusor” (Voldemort’s real name in the French edition of the Harry Potter novels). His proposal “Mimblewimble” — a reference to a Harry Potter spell — presents a radical slimming-down of the Bitcoin protocol that could not only dramatically increase privacy and fungibility, but also present significantly more scalability than Bitcoin’s current blockchain architecture.\n\nMimblewimble may just hit two giant birds with one stone. Here’s how.\n\nHiding Amounts\n\nMimblewimble is based on some of Bitcoin’s familiar privacy features. One of these is Confidential Transactions, which was mostly developed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Gregory Maxwell and is currently deployed on Blockstream’s Elements Alpha sidechain.\n\nConfidential Transactions lets senders encrypt the bitcoin amounts in transactions with random strings of numbers called “blinding factors.” This process works because transactions also include information with which (only) receivers can decrypt the amounts. And, by utilizing a cryptographic trick called the Pedersen Commitment, anyone else can still perform math on the encrypted amounts. Specifically, Bitcoin nodes can subtract the encrypted amounts on the sending side of transactions (“inputs”) from the encrypted amounts on the receiving side of transactions (“outputs”). If the two sides cancel out to zero, it means the combined inputs and the combined outputs are equal, and no bitcoins were created out of thin air.\n\nMimblewimble sort of turns this trick on its head as the receiver of a transaction generates the blinding factor. This is important because as one of the main deviations from the current Bitcoin protocol, this blinding factor is effectively used to prove ownership of the (blinded) bitcoins — private keys are no longer in play at all. (Nor are public keys or addresses.)\n\nProving ownership of the blinding factor itself revolves around a series of cryptographic tricks that are Mimblewimble’s closest equivalent to Bitcoin’s cryptographic signatures, though the full extent of these tricks is beyond the scope of this article.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that part of these mathematical maneuvers includes the introduction of a sort of “dummy output.” Where transaction outputs normally indicate under what conditions the receiver of a transaction may later spend the bitcoins, these dummy outputs are really just random numbers to ensure that only the person who generated the blinding factor can spend the bitcoins in the real outputs.\n\nCombining Transactions\n\nAnother familiar Bitcoin trick that inspired Mimblewimble is CoinJoin, first proposed by (again) Maxwell.\n\nCoinJoin allows users to bundle their transactions into one bigger transaction, scrambling all inputs (the “from” part of a transaction), as well as all outputs (the “to” part). This potentially obfuscates which bitcoins were sent from which address to which address, and breaks the assumption that all inputs belong to the same user.\n\nMimblewimble (and a fix by Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra) takes this concept a bit further and completely gets rid of transactions once a new block is created. Instead of transactions, Mimblewimble blocks mainly consist of three lists: a list of new inputs (referring to old outputs), a list of new outputs and a list of cryptographic signatures created with the aforementioned dummy outputs.\n\nUtilizing the Pedersen Commitment scheme, all nodes can use the input list and the output list, and verify that no bitcoins were created out of thin air. The dummy output signatures, meanwhile, prove that all individual transactions must have been valid. Acting rather like “stamps of approval,” these dummy output signatures only add up mathematically if the whole transaction itself does.\n\nAnd since it is never revealed which inputs spent bitcoins to which outputs exactly, nor how many bitcoins were actually spent, no trace of funds can be established at all. As such, Mimblewimble presents a tremendous boon for privacy and fungibility.\n\nScalability\n\nAnd then there’s the scalability improvement.\n\nCurrently, many transactions on the Bitcoin network are linked. Spending a bitcoin really takes an output from a previous transaction and turns it into an input of a new transaction. This means that if an older transaction is invalid, a newer transaction that relies on the older transaction is invalid, too. So to be able to validate all transactions on the Bitcoin network, nodes must know all transactions that ever took place; the entire blockchain. (That’s currently some 80 gigabytes worth.)\n\nBut with Mimblewimble there is no longer really such a thing as a transaction history per coin. Each coin does have a specific block in which it was first created. But from then on, its value simply becomes part of the combined Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set, which defines all outputs that store coins and could potentially be spent at any time.\n\nThis means that in order to verify new transactions, nodes no longer need to care about previous transactions. All they need to care about is that the specific outputs used are valid.\n\nWith even more clever math, nodes can establish the validity of outputs relatively easily. They just need the block headers of all blocks (a sort of index of blocks without all transaction data) and the aforementioned dummy output signatures: both relatively compact data-sets. All other transaction data — almost the entire blockchain — can be safely discarded.\n\nThe benefit compared to other anonymizing techniques is substantial. If Confidential Transactions and CoinJoin had been used in Bitcoin from day one, nodes would currently require more than a terabyte of data to operate. With Mimblewimble, they would need closer to 120 gigabytes. And perhaps even more interesting: where the blockchain necessarily has to grow over time, the required Mimblewimble dataset does not, and can actually shrink if more bitcoins are stored in fewer outputs.\n\nCompatibility\n\nNow for the bad news. Mimblewimble, in its current form, is not very compatible with the Bitcoin protocol. This is mainly because for Mimblewimble to work, script must be purged from transactions. As such, there would no longer be room for a whole set of Bitcoin features, like time-locked transactions (used for the Lightning Network among other things), atomic swaps (for cross-blockchain interoperability), and more.\n\nBut that doesn’t make Mimblewimble useless. Mimblewimble may, for instance, be the perfect fit for a privacy-focused sidechain. Bitcoin users could lock their bitcoins into a specific output on the Bitcoin blockchain and “move” their coins to the Mimblewimble chain. On this sidechain, users could transact freely and privately for as long as they want, until the new owner decides to “move” the funds back to the Bitcoin blockchain by unlocking the original output.\n\nDue to the efficiency offered by Mimblewimble’s sidechain, the added burden of maintaining it would be very manageable. Moreover, it could potentially unload much data from the Bitcoin blockchain, increasing scalability even for those who don’t use Mimblewimble at all. Where sidechains are typically not considered a scaling solution, Mimblewimble offers one.\n\nFor a full technical explanation of Mimblewimble, including the mathematical details, see the white paper.', 'France has received a new bitcoin ATM from the ATM Bitcoin Exchange as it starts its international expansion.

Named after the guilder Dutch currency that the euro replaced, it has gained a significant level of acceptance among Dutch businesses.\n\nIt’s clear to see that while the Netherlands may be significantly smaller than other countries that certainly hasn’t stopped it from embracing bitcoin and the blockchain technology.\n\nAs fears circulate London and its status as the FinTech centre following Brexit, the Netherlands certainly has a shot at claiming the top spot.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"

As of last year, the Bitcoin network—comprised of all the machines on Earth running the Bitcoin software—used 6,000 times more computing power than the world\'s top 500 supercomputers combined to run the decentralized system that mines and tracks the digital currency.\n\nBut while many have tried to come up with constructive ways to utilize all those CPU cycles, two mischievous researchers recently proposed the opposite: A malicious cryptocurrency that can only be mined by participating in digital attacks on other computers.\n\nIn a paper presented at the 2016 USENIX computer security symposium, researchers Eric Wustrow and Benjamin VanderSloot propose what they call ""DDoSCoin,"" a theoretical cryptocurrency that uses a ""malicious proof-of-work"" derived from participating in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, the digital blockades that make websites temporarily unavailable by flooding them with millions of simultaneous requests.\n\n""On the other hand, something similar to DDoSCoin might lower the barrier to collecting rewards for DoS attacks, ultimately driving down the cost for hacktivist consumers""\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Bitcoin and other blockchain-based currencies are ""mined"" into existence by a network of powerful machines, which work together to continually solve insanely complex mathematical puzzles. Computing the solutions to those puzzles results in a ""proof-of-work,"" which generates fresh coins and cryptographically ensures the legitimacy to other users through a distributed public ledger called the blockchain.\n\nBut instead of the arbitrary math problems used by Bitcoin and its ilk, DDoSCoin\'s malicious proof-of-work (which the authors call ""Proof-of-DDoS"") functions by checking the cryptographically-signed responses that a website\'s server returns whenever a user connects to it. That way, the system can reward users who prove they\'ve participated in an attack by verifying they\'ve flooded the targeted site with enough requests.\n\nWhen I asked the researchers why (oh god, why) they would unleash such a thing upon the world, their initial emailed response was: ""¯\\_(ツ)_/¯""\n\n""Other researchers had explored alternate kinds of proof-of-work systems, but we think there\'s still a lot of possibilities for further efforts,"" Wustrow told Motherboard in an email. ""Proof-of-DDos might not be a good ultimate end goal, but there are aspects of the idea that may prompt thinking along these or similar lines … We hope that Proof-of-DDoS is eye-catching enough to get people thinking more about these ideas.""\n\nThe DDoSCoin system also allows its participants to choose specific sites to target through consensus. However, since the proof-of-DDoS concept relies on verifying encrypted TLS connections to a victim website, the participants will only be able to target sites that support those secure connections. Currently, about 56% of Alexa\'s top million websites support TLS. But that number is expected to increase as the encryption standard becomes more widespread, the researchers say.\n\nThe proposal hearkens back to Operation Payback, the DDoS attack led by the nebulous hacktivist collective Anonymous in 2010, which temporarily took down Paypal\'s website in protest of the company\'s refusal to process donations to Wikileaks. Despite the temporary nature of the blockade, many of the digital protest\'s participants faced jail time before taking a plea bargain in 2013.\n\nWhile the dynamics of DDoS attacks have changed a lot since 2010, Wustrow thinks that something like DDoSCoin could encourage hacktivists, who might use the system to incentivize others to perform attacks on their behalf.\n\n""However, it\'s probably still easier and more effective to just pay a \'reputable\' botnet to do this for you,"" he says. ""On the other hand, something similar to DDoSCoin might lower the barrier to collecting rewards for DoS attacks, ultimately driving down the cost for hacktivist consumers.""\n\nThe same could be said for more nefarious criminal hackers and pranksters, who would undoubtedly use something like DDoSCoin to further incentivize harassment, extortion, and state-sponsored cyber attacks.\n\nAs for the implications of creating a system designed to encourage malicious digital activity, the researchers insist that even if someone were to actually create their theoretical system, the moral and ethical responsibility of its creators should be considered separately from that of its users.\n\n""I\'m not a lawyer, so I won\'t speak about legal responsibility,"" says Wustrow. ""In our paper we have only attempted to show that the idea is possible; we have not pushed to actually make it a reality today.""', 'Today, we’ll take a look at six of the market’s best Bitcoin debit cards. We’ll look at where it all started and how far we’ve come, and then declare a winner.\n\nMaybe, in the year 2025, the vast majority of the mainstream world will offer a Bitcoin payment option just as ubiquitously as they do PayPal. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and Bitcoin has made a lot of progress in seven years. Yet, Bitcoin’s advanced peer-to-peer payment system will have to ride the rails of the rather ancient 1950’s-based debit card technology until the world catches up to “The Future of Money.”\n\nIt is a clear case of taking one step back to take several steps forward, at some point in the future. If you have not yet seen it, Andreas Antonopoulos brilliantly explains this rather clumsy game of technological leapfrog through the course of human history here.\n\nEventually, the superior technology wins out, but we are still a few years away from that event horizon. Until that day comes, you and I are stuck using debit card technology, whose only technological update worth mentioning is a metallic chip on the front of some offerings. Many still do without, with little or no consequence.\n\nThe world still runs on plastic, so the Bitcoin business community has begun to offer more and better debit card options over the last three years. Let’s start with the first one to hit the market, back in 2013.\n\nBitPlastic\n\nIf you go to BitPlastic’s website, their site’s graphics will mention, more than once, that it is “The world’s only Bitcoin debit card.” This was the first Bitcoin debit card I had ever seen, back in 2013, when the others were still a gleam in a corporation’s eye, but the world has changed a lot in three years. Bitplastic? Not so much. Their terms are still much the same as they always were, but it still has some solid market benefits that could prove useful, depending upon your needs.\n\nIt comes with a Bitcoin wallet, an online shopping cart to accept Bitcoin payments on your website, and a PayPal Exchange. The card does not require any identification to receive, taking any future identity theft through centralization of your information out of the equation.\n\nTheir web services are also TOR compatible. BitPlastic actually encourages you to use a fake name and TOR email to get started. Since it does not require your ID, your name is not printed on the card. This is a double-edged sword, as you can take money out of ATM’s anonymously, but it can be difficult to find an offline merchant who will accept a nameless card at checkout.\n\nMany websites will also fail to process a card with no name. They do use Visa, the world’s largest merchant processor, so no demerits there, but if you lose the card, you’ve also lost your BTC. Cripes!\n\nThe terms of service are where BitPlastic starts to lose a lot of steam. Getting the card costs 0.25 BTC, which right now is almost $150 USD, and subject to change, so it is by far the most expensive card you can buy. Daily ATM withdrawal limits are still just $200 USD. ATM fees are low at $1.50 USD, but there is a 5% conversion fee for moving Bitcoin into cash on your card.\n\nAnd it also does not appear to offer an option to use other global currencies, only the U.S. Dollar. America was the only real Bitcoin market for Bitcoin, back when BitPlastic began.\n\nBeing the first Bitcoin debit card is to be respected, but the market has passed the card by, not just the site’s graphics. BitPlastic should update all of the above.\n\nShift\n\nShift works in association with the ever-popular Coinbase wallet, Dwolla, and Visa, so it has a strong foundation to operate from, and millions of potential consumers to assist.\n\nThey market themselves as the first U.S. debit card. This is significant in that regulations have limited the access of some Bitcoin card companies to the U.S. consumer. Some have found a way around these pitfalls and Shift is one of them.\n\nBenefits include a responsive mobile app for “immediate spending notifications,” no charge for domestic transactions, nor any conversion fee from BTC to fiat. The card itself is fairly priced at $10 USD.\n\nIssues are not insignificant. It is only available to U.S. consumers, and even then, not in all 50 states (45 states at this time). Daily limits are $1000 USD without identification, but for those who submit documentation, these can be raised if you email them. Dwolla account users can get $500 per day from an ATM. Coinbase is limited to just $200.\n\nShift is a solid debit card, but can only play in one market and one currency, and its spending limits are…limiting. Let’s see if we can do better.\n\nWirex\n\nWirex has been rebranded last year from the E-Coin card. I, personally, had their E-Coin card, so I can write some experience, but it will lose some relevance, as it was from its previous form.\n\nWirex advantages include a responsive mobile app, multiple currencies available (USD, EUR, GBP), and worldwide delivery brings everyone into the Bitcoin fold. Also, there is no limit to the value of purchases made online when using Wirex.\n\nPotential downsides include a monthly SMS Notification Fee, higher than average card costs ($17 for the physical card and $3 for a “virtual” card for online purchases,) and limits on card loads and cash withdrawals without identification. Lifetime ATM withdrawal limit is $1000 USD until verified, so the $200-400 ATM transaction limits are made irrelevant until you submit to KYC/AML. Maximum load on the card is $2500 until verified, but ATM and card loading limits are totally removed after ID submission.\n\nIn my personal experience, the ATM limits are the same as they were last year. The customer support for my E-Coin card was poor. This may have changed since the rebranding, but I was disappointed and was inclined to look elsewhere, finding another card on this list to use.\n\nXapo\n\nXapo is another elder statesman in the Bitcoin community, beginning operations as a company back in 2013. Xapo does serve major markets like China, Japan, Canada, and the U.K.\n\nXapo does not serve most African countries (except South Africa, which it accepts) and the United States. Xapo has not been able to maneuver around their regulatory hurdles, while others have, and their troubles there have been well documented.\n\nBenefits include your own Bitcoin wallet and Xapo “Vault,” which is free to use. The Vault feature allows far greater Bitcoin security, advanced encryption, offline storage and “military-grade physical security.”\n\nLocations include Europe, Oceania, and the U.S., which is interesting since they can’t serve U.S. consumers or citizens your Xapo account also allows you to buy Bitcoins directly using five different currencies, and the card converts Bitcoin into USD, GBP, or EUR.\n\nPotential issues include an above average price (up to $20 USD,) cards can take up to 35 days to be received, depending on your location (faster delivery times reserved for Europeans,) and annual fees after year one, which is free. ATM limits are the same as Wirex. $200 per ATM transaction, $200 per day and $1k limit until ID verified, which removes all limits.\n\nCryptoPay\n\nIf you look up “Bitcoin debit cards” in Google, the CryptoPay card comes up first in the results. Does that mean it is the best debit card? Let’s see.\n\nBenefits include access via the three major currencies, you can buy the card with these currencies, or with Bitcoin, and they ship for free anywhere in the world. You’ll get faster delivery times in Europe, which is about 5 business days.\n\nThe card price is slightly above average, at $15 USD/EUR/GBP. They offer 3-day shipping with DHL, but the prices can go up to $75 USD. Like Wirex, you also have to pay for a “virtual” card, this time, $2.50. And there are monthly service fees for all their cards, even the one that doesn’t really exist, so you get two monthly fees. There is also a 1% card loading fee as well.\n\nBitPay\n\nNow we come to the newest kid on the block, the BitPay debit card. This card has only been available for three months, and I personally own one of these cards. As you can see, it does not have one of those metallic chips in the front, but it not limited its usability to me.\n\nBenefits include the highest limits of this comparison, without verification. Each card can hold up to $25,000 in funds, and up to $3,000 can be withdrawn daily, $750 at a time, all highest in this review. This removes the need for any verification at all.\n\nNo documentation is needed and the card costs a low $9.95 to obtain. You can set up direct deposits on the card, if you get paid in Bitcoin, through your personal account website. And there also is no charge to change your PIN (most cards here have a $1 charge.)\n\nDemerits include it is only available to U.S. citizens, and you can only buy one with Bitcoin, not fiat. Other currencies also are not available at launch. They only ask for an SS#, date of birth, name, and address in their online order form.\n\nMy personal experience is that the card has been exactly what I would want in a Bitcoin debit card. Transfers into dollars can be done in less than 60 seconds. The online account is easy to use and customer support has been solid. No docs needed for high limits were really what I wanted. I have not had one issue since receiving the card.\n\nIf I wanted to jump through KYC/AML hoops, I’d get a bank account. I don’t get my identity captured by who-knows-who, and I get to spend my Bitcoins freely, with limits high enough to buy a new car! A win-win for me. In my opinion, it is the next generation of Bitcoin debit cards.\n\nThe winner in this comparison is going to depend on your location and citizenship. If you are an American, the BitPay card is the easy winner. High limits, easy to use, and no third-party data collection make it easy to recommend.\n\nBeing only a few months old, it needs to be more inclusive of the global Bitcoin market, but if BitPay can handle American customers as well as they have handled me, they are the global card of the future.\n\nFor those in the rest of the world’s markets, Xapo has proved why it is one of the oldest and best cards programs on the market today. Plenty of security and currency options to choose from, and their website has all the bases covered if you need answers to your Bitcoin questions. It offers more security features and fewer fees than CryptoPay. Xapo acts like it has done this before, because it has done it before pretty much everyone.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nNo card is perfect, but the market has come a long way since BitPlastic, and just because you own Bitcoin does not mean you can’t shop conveniently, anywhere in the world.\n\nYou now have plenty of solid options, and a healthy competitive consumer card environment which is making the Bitcoin consumers the real winners. Isn’t that the point?\n\nIf you want to learn more about Bitcoin debit cards, read our next article on this topic «8 Major Bitcoin Debit Cards: How Private and Anonymous Are They?»', ""Exchanges seem to be emerging as a weak point of Bitcoin. As recently as August 3, 2016 The Guardian reported that 120,000 Bitcoin worth US$ 78 million were stolen from Bitfinex, a Hong Kong based exchange.\n\nBack in 2014 Mt. Gox, a Tokyo based Bitcoin exchange responsible for handling as much as 70 per cent of Bitcoin transactions went under. The reasons for Mt.Gox’s winding up - mismanagement, neglect and ‘raw inexperience’ according to wired.com.\n\nThat disappearance of a major exchange also made US$ 460 million vanish in a puff of air.\n\nBitcoin should have been empowering but...\n\nThe idea of Bitcoin is that anyone who has access to basic technology such as a mobile phone would also have access to a fully functional bank account by default. However, unlike a traditional bank account there are some differences.\n\nWith Bitcoin, you are ultimately responsible for your money. You need to keep it safe and secure and you need to make sure that there are no mistakes made in the transfer of money from Point A to Point B, because there is no going back.\n\nThis immutability, which is typically considered a strength is perhaps also the achilles heel of the Bitcoin system.\n\nAs an example, if you pay with a credit card and you are victim of a fraud, you might be able to initiate a chargeback and the ‘bad’ transaction will go away. This is much more complicated when you use a Bitcoin-like system.\n\nImmutability can cut both ways\n\nPrior to the Bitfinex fiasco, the most discussed hack was probably the DAO heist which cost DAO holders US$ 50 million. The Ethereum community decided to implement a hardfork to try to reverse that damage.\n\nUnfortunately that ended up splitting the currency itself and now we have ended up with two flavours of Ethereum, the regular Ethereum and a new-old currency called Ethereum Classic.\n\nCan these forks to reverse dodgy happenings be considered as a form of customer protection like deposit insurance?\n\nWe talked with Fran Strajnar, CEO at BNC, and he says:\n\n“What happened to the DAO was the world's first citizen asset forfeiture. A user driven bail-out. It was not insurance by definition, nor should it be viewed this way.”\n\nIndeed many people would agree that immutability is a characteristic of cryptocurrencies which is worth preserving.\n\nAs Aleksandar Matanovic, CEO of EC District, points out, “I would be very disappointed to see the DAO approach being replicated to Bitcoin.”\n\nLack of deposit insurance is affecting Bitcoin adoption\n\nAt the moment the fiat currency banking system certainly has an advantage in the form of deposit guarantee insurance. In the United States such an insurance is given by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In the United Kingdom this type of insurance is available from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and many other countries have similar provisions as well.\n\nIn the Bitcoin world though such an insurance is not available from any governmental body. Coinbase does provide a private insurance cover to its users. The insurance that Coinbase provides is only against theft and ‘electronic compromise’. They are very categorical in mentioning that “This insurance policy does not cover damages resulting from a specific user's loss, such as the losses resulting from a compromise of the customer login credentials.”\n\nWould having such an insurance make a difference to how widely Bitcoin is adopted? Aleksandar Matanovic believes that it does make a difference.\n\nHe says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“I do think that a lot of people don’t feel comfortable being totally responsible for holding their assets. Add Bitcoin’s complexity and regulatory uncertainty in the mix and there are plenty of reasons for a majority of people to wait and watch rather than get involved.”\n\nAnother point which is worth considering is institutional investors. Presence of deposit guarantee insurance could attract more investments into Bitcoin as well.\n\nFran Strajnar makes a point about this issue:\n\n“Lack of deposit guarantee on exchanges is a concern for the buy-side. Some guarantee would see more institutional investors come into this Asset-Class.”\n\nDeposit Insurance or similar is possible in Bitcoin\n\nThe experience of hackings, thefts and mismanagement at Bitcoin exchanges can be seen as a learning curve, albeit an expensive one. Innovative answers to the lack of a deposit guarantee can be brought out from within the Bitcoin community as well. Deposit insurance like products, for example, could be offered by private companies.\n\nAleksandar Matanovic describes one possible solution:\n\n“I think very soon we could have companies storing customers’ Bitcoins (or altcoins) with a deposit guarantee and charging small fee for that. Similar to paying for the safe deposit box in the bank.”\n\nThere are other solutions too which are possible due to the unique nature of cryptocurrencies themselves.\n\nFran Strajnar explains:\n\n”Cryptocurrencies will eventually evolve to offer more guarantees in the form of collateralized and insured exchanges, particularly if we see a successful ETF. We will also see a range of new decentralized instruments come to market which put ownership of balances (private keys) on trading platforms back into users hands.”\n\nKeep your money safe - It is common sense\n\nExchange vulnerability is now a widely discussed phenomenon and anyone who deals with cryptocurrencies should practice some level of commonsense. It is best not to leave unnecessary funds lying around in an exchange wallet. My colleague Joseph Young has written an excellent article on where to store your Bitcoin.\n\nRemember until the time there is a deposit insurance on cryptocurrencies, you are responsible for the safekeeping of your money."", ""A new report from the World Economic Forum predicts that the underlying technology introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin will come to occupy a central place in the global financial system.\n\nThe Blockchain has received what could be termed as it biggest endorsement yet since its creation. In a statement released with this report Giancarlo Bruno, the head of financial services industries, at the World Economic Forum, says:\n\n“Rather than to stay at the margins of the finance industry Blockchain will become the beating heart of it.”\n\nThe unique characteristics of the Blockchain makes it impossible for it to be ignored. Rather, it presents a platform where other concepts and technologies can build upon, especially within the global financial system. CoinTelegraph spoke to experts about the Blockchain, its implementation and impact on the finance industry.\n\nNo need to reinvent the wheel\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph about this development Simon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture, identifies the importance of the Blockchain, being the technology behind Bitcoin but he also points out its present deficiencies.\n\nDixon says:\n\n“The technology behind Bitcoin is open source and over 1000 Blockchains exist today. The reason why none of them work at scale or are secure is because the technology behind Bitcoin is nowhere near as valuable as the largest distributed supercomputer in the world securing Bitcoin and the network effect of its miners.”\n\nDixon goes on to explain that while anybody can copy the technology as you can any open source code, very few will be able to create anything as secure as Bitcoin because it is easier to build on top of Bitcoin.\n\n“Why re-create the internet when it is already being used by everybody? You may have a better feature, but getting everybody to use it is the real value of the internet, just like the real value of Bitcoin is the computer power behind it.”\n\nBitcoin is already a global phenomenon\n\nIn his own analysis Kumar Gaurav, Co-Founder and CEO of Cashaa, identifies the unique characteristics of Bitcoin and its associated technology.\n\nGaurav also describes what he believes will be the systematic procedure that may lead to the anticipated breakthrough of Bitcoin and the Blockchain into mainstream.\n\nGaurav tells Cointelegraph:\n\n“Bitcoin is a completely new product which has a number of features that, altogether, no other product has. Bitcoin is cheap, instant, no frills, and cross-border transfer of values without the need of a physical object. Clearly these characteristics pose a number of questions and challenges to public authorities. Can we seriously think that such a high quality product can be banned by the public authorities of all the world? Realistically not”.\n\nGaurav predicts that Bitcoin will increase its success and matter in people's lives, which will make regulators more active since it is already happening in the sharing economy: Uber and Airbnb share similar regulatory fluid situation.\n\nHe continues by saying that to which point Bitcoin will be regulated would be an impossible question to answer. However, he points out that Bitcoin is already a global phenomenon and any strict regulation will only have the effect to make the use of Bitcoin more underground and this is not in best interests of any government.\n\nTherefore there should be a proper balance in regulation which works for everybody.\n\nImmutable and trustless transference of value\n\nChristopher Franko, President of the Borderless Charity, and Founder of Borderless.tech, expresses his total agreement that the Blockchain is on its way to going mainstream.\n\nFranko says:\n\n“Reports by Santander show that by 2022 banks utilizing Blockchain technology could save an estimated $20B in fee's. Whether or not those savings get passed onto customers is up for speculation. Either way, what that degree of savings does is provide an incredible monetary incentive for large banks to adopt some sort of Blockchain technology. By doing so they validate the whole idea.”\n\nFranko identifies certain benefits of the Blockchain to global finance to include immutable and trustless transference of value. He continues by saying that such is the main reason to use Blockchain as opposed to using traditional database architecture.\n\nHe says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Coupled with fault tolerance, it becomes a no-brainer for huge corporations who need 100% accurate, auditable data that is always available. As I have said in previous interviews, big banks ironically don't really trust each other which makes inter-banking collaboration understandably cumbersome and costly to accomplish.”\n\nAs honest as maths\n\nFranko concludes by saying that the Blockchain acts as a cost effective and honest arbiter that guarantees every party knows with a finite degree of certainty that every other party is implicitly honest. Not because they are good people, even good people can do dishonest things, but because mathematically it can be no other way.\n\nThat's powerful and exactly what our civilization needs in order to get to the next stage of human development."", 'Russian authorities have gone back on their idea to penalize whoever is caught in bitcoin operations in the country, says a report by Russian news agency Interfax.\n\nThough Interfax referenced unnamed sources close to the Russian government’s financial departments, it suggested that representatives from the country’s Ministry of Finance, central bank, and other government bureaus are increasingly supportive of this action.\n\nThe Finance Ministry had planned to submit legislation in May that would punish those who use digital currencies with fines as high as $38,000 and jail sentences of up to seven years, according to media reports.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice and the Interior Ministry in Russia had reportedly questioned the “public danger” that bitcoin supposedly brings, as proposed by the Finance Ministry.\n\nSources had said that the Ministry of Justice was in disagreement with some of the wording of the bill proposing a ban on money “surrogates” as a term that has frequently been associated with bitcoin and virtual currencies.\n\nIn Moscow in 2014 Deputy Finance Minister Aleksey Moiseev had told journalists that:\n\nPeople can play with their chips, and they can call them money, but they can’t use these surrogate currencies as tender. We will discuss this law in the current session of parliament, and possibly even pass it then, or at the very latest by spring next year. We are currently dealing with comments from the law enforcement agencies, about the specifics of legal measures, and we will take their remarks into account. But the overall concept of the law is set in stone.\n\nRussia had wanted to join the number of countries including Bolivia, Iceland, and Vietnam which have taken steps to criminalize bitcoin despite its growing popularity and opposing criticisms that such regulations won’t work.\n\nThe Finance Ministry’s proposal had been to prohibit the issuance of all cryptocurrencies or their use in exchange for goods and services in Russia.\n\nLater, Russia’s media regulator blockaded bitcoin-related sites. Roskomnadzor blocked five websites, including popular cryptocurrency community bitcoin.org, sponsored by the Bitcoin Foundation, and entered them into its blacklist of banned websites.\n\nThe rationale for the ban on cryptocurrencies is that they facilitate money-laundering and other forms of digital and ‘real world’ criminal activity.\n\nBitcoin’s use has been under threat in Russia as its legal status has grown murkier over the course of the past year. In January 2014, Russia’s Central Bank (CBR) issued a statement, warning against the use of virtual currencies due to potential ties to “money laundering or terrorist activities.” The Central Bank also said that bitcoin usage was illegal under Russian federal law.\n\nThe reversal, as it seems now, will end two years of speculation that Russia would seek to actively discourage the use of cryptocurrencies and other “money surrogates” through administrative fines and labor penalties.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""The digital currency markets repeatedly remind us of a tired but true maxim: your money is only as secure as the bank that guards it.\n\nAfter a recent hack resulted in the theft of $70 million worth of bitcoin, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex caused a minor panic when it announced it would spread the losses equally among all its customers, even those whose holdings weren't touched. In doing so, the exchange called our attention — yet again — to how vulnerable virtual currencies are to criminals who hack through the Internet-connected systems that handle money transactions.\n\nProponents of the technology behind bitcoin say the problem isn’t with the blockchain technology that underpins the currency but rather with the way exchanges store the code that determines ownership. In other words, the banks' security is to blame.\n\nBitfinex, one of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges, was hardly the first to suffer from a cyberheist. The most famous robbery came in 2014, when the Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox announced $480 million had been stolen by hackers and filed for bankruptcy. Its customers are still waiting to a claim a fraction of their deposits.\n\nThis latest theft is rattling the cryptocurrency community. “The failure of one company to secure the private keys of its users is casting a shadow, unfairly, over the bitcoin ecosystem,” Alex Tapscott, co-author of “Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World,” told Salon. “This hack demonstrates the urgent need for stronger governance.”"", 'Antony Lewis is a bitcoin and blockchain consultant, who previously served as the director of business development at bitcoin exchange itBit.\n\nIn this article, Lewis attempts to describe two very different uses for blockchain technology and why the division of these two functions is increasingly of interest to enterprise firms.\n\nOn Tuesday, 2nd August, I had the privilege of attending an event hosted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state\'s central bank and financial services regulator.\n\nFor 90 minutes, we heard from an all-star panel: Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset; David Gurle, CEO of Symphony; Daniel Gallancy, CEO of SolidX; and Tim Grant, head of R3\'s Lab and Research Centre.\n\nOne of the panelists said something that got me thinking – using blockchains for what she called \'proof of satisfaction\', ie evidence of agreement or assertion that something happened to the satisfaction of the parties involved.\n\nIt seems that two types of blockchain* or distributed ledger are emerging: blockchains as digital token ledgers, and blockchains as registers where proofs of activities (transactions, bets, etc) are recorded.\n\n1. Digital token ledgers\n\nThese ledgers record ownership and changes to ownership of digital tokens.\n\nThere are two distinct types of token:\n\nDigital assets: The token is the asset. The classic example of this is bitcoin. You own a bitcoin, that\'s it – you can’t take that to anyone and claim the \'underlying\' thing. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, doesn’t own a bunch of gold he promises to give you if you wave a bitcoin at him. (Neither do central banks for fiat currencies, but that’s for a different post).\n\nA bitcoin is your asset, and there is no corresponding liability owed by someone else.\n\nDigital claims: The digital token is a claim for something against someone else who promises to give you the actual asset upon presentation of the token. It\'s a debt token, or an IOU. It’s your asset, but their liability.\n\nThe classic example is user-issued tokens on Ripple, where ""gateways"" (eg banks) issue tokens representing underlying assets (eg gold) or issue them in place of existing liabilities (eg currency deposits).\n\nThese tokens can be passed around to different owners, where changes to ownership are recorded on the shared ledger, and where owners ultimately need to come back to the issuer to claim the underlying thing, rather like claiming your coat by presenting your cloakroom ticket at the theatre.\n\n(Note: user-issued tokens on Ripple are not to be confused with Ripple’s underlying token XRP, which actually is an asset).\n\n2. Activity registers\n\nThis second class of blockchain contains entries that feature data, usually fingerprints of data called hashes, possibly stored with some other non-sensitive metadata. The data can represent anything, but in the financial services context, they might be trading facts about transactions negotiated and agreed ""off-chain"" via another channel.\n\nThis keeps the commercially sensitive secrets off the industry-shared ledger, while leaving an indelible mark on it that can be referred to later if needed.\n\nFor example:\n\nTwo banks agree on a trade, with various trade facts (dates, price, amounts, etc). They can agree via any mechanism such as telephone, email, click and trade, or carrier pigeon. They both record the trade details in some very standardized way (standards are important here as pedantry is key when creating and agreeing hashes). They calculate and agree the hash of the trade facts. The hash gets submitted onto some sort of timestamped industry blockchain, cryptographically signed or agreed by one or more parties.\n\nNote that the hashes themselves can\'t be backwards-engineered into the trade fact data if they are well constructed. But in the future, either party can take their copy of the trade facts and show it to anyone interested and point to the hash on the blockchain which proves:\n\nThese are the original trade facts – or at least these trade facts existed at the timestamp time.\n\nWhoever signed the hashes, must have also agreed to the trade facts (if there was some some sort of requirement for both parties to put a signature against the hash in the first place).\n\nThis concept can also be used to store data such as images, newspaper headlines, identity information, etc.\n\nWhich blockchain should activities be registered on?\n\nPrivate blockchain supporters prefer to store proofs of activity in databases visible to only known participants, with the comfort that all writers are known entities, and censorship may be possible, if required, and it is also cheap to write on a private blockchain.\n\nPublic blockchain supporters would argue that if all you’re doing is putting hashes somewhere without giving away any trade facts, then why not use bitcoin’s blockchain as it is the most tamper-resistant and battle-tested chain, and the cost of transactions can be kept low by bundling data and committing the bundle at once – using techniques like Merkle trees.\n\nPersonally, I think the industry needs more differentiated terminology, or to at least be clear on what we are talking about. I would suggest ""distributed ledgers with asset tokens"", ""distributed ledgers with claim tokens"" and ""distributed activity registers"".\n\nNot as sexy as ‘blockchain’, but probably more clear.\n\nSummary\n\nBlockchains seem to be being used for very different uses: recording ownership changes of digital tokens, and recording activity with timestamped proofs of existence of data or agreements about data.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin has a blockchain which contains:\n\nAsset tokens (BTC) – this was the intended use\n\nClaim tokens in the form of volored coins etc – not really the intended use\n\nHashes of data – not really the intended use.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum has a blockchain which contains:\n\nAsset tokens (ETH or ETC depending on which ethereum!)\n\nA multitude of \'user generated\' tokens that are created and managed through smart contracts\n\nHashes stored in smart contracts.\n\nRipple\n\nRipple is a distributed ledger which contains:\n\nAsset tokens (XRP) used mainly as an anti-spam mechanism to make each transaction cost a tiny amount\n\nClaim tokens (gateway-issued tokens) whose transmission from user to user is the main purpose of Ripple\n\nHashes of data – not really the intended use\n\nPrivate Industry Activity Registers\n\nThese may be distributed or not, but they are databases that contain:\n\nImmutable(ish) records of hashes of private activities between participants\n\nUsually cryptographically signed by known participants for non-repudiation.\n\nThe distributed ledgers may not include records of real final settlement of actual digital assets eg stock ownership unless the token is the asset a la bitcoin or a real central bank-issued digital currency.\n\nIn the private blockchain space, there are still privacy issues around letting your competitors know what you own.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lewis\'s blog Bits on Blocks, and has been republished here with his permission.\n\nChicken and egg image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

To date, it has polarized blockchain experts while winning scores of newcomers to the technology.\n\nThe brain-child of Daniel Larimer, founder of BitShares, and Ned Scott, a former financial analyst, Steemit aims to provide a place for individuals to create content, promote the content they believe is good and comment on stories — all while earning money.\n\nBut Steemit is more than just a website for earning spare change.\n\nIt’s an actual blockchain built on a piece of technology developed by Larimer called Graphene, which allows for the deployment of application-specific blockchains.\n\nScott, in interview with CoinDesk, explained that the team only had the idea for Steemit back in January and, because of the Graphene framework, they were able to quickly roll the project out.\n\nThe rest, like most things in the blockchain space, is a bit difficult to explain.\n\nThe pop\n\nFor the first few months, there wasn’t much talk about Steemit.\n\nWhile there were early miners and people contributing content, the real big bang didn’t come until 4th July. When the dam opened, $1.3m worth of stored-up blockchain-based currency called ""steem"" was released to those that had been participating on the platform.\n\nScott explained that, while all of the blog posts, comments and upvotes that had occurred on the site pre-July 4th were all on the blockchain, the rewards users had been promised for their contributions had not been distributed. The underlying idea was that the team wanted to continue testing the platform, finding bugs and fixing them prior to a rush of new people signing up.\n\nHe cautioned that, no matter how diligent the development team is, there are going to be bugs and that they wanted to ensure that Steemit was safe and secure for everyone.\n\nNevertheless, 4th July was a day that they had all been looking forward to.\n\nScott said:\n\n""What happened on 4th July, it was like a three-month long day that finally ended. Today, the rewards pool distributes in a continuous matter. On that first day, it was sort of this moment that had been building up.""\n\nAnd with that pop, users who had been watching their balances rise were instantly rewarded.\n\nOne currency, two smart contracts\n\nPart of the confusion with Steemit lies in the different ways that the currency is presented to users.\n\nAt the root is the currency Steem, which is the typical transferrable, fungible, freely moveable token akin to bitcoin, ethereum or any other cryptocurrency. But that same Steem can be put into two different types of smart contracts depending on the particular utility an individual wants.\n\nThe first is called Steem Power, which provides utility and leverage. Steem Power is the backbone of an account\'s voting-potential. In other words, the more Steem Power an individual has, the stronger their vote is on Steemit.\n\nScott explained that the team wanted to provide a mechanism by which individuals could take a long-term interest in the project, while allowing others to continue with their speculation. In the white paper, Steem Power is compared to long-term capital commitments, similar to what a venture capitalist might do.\n\nWhile users can invest their money instantly, there is an expectation that it will take time to see a return on that investment.\n\nIn the case of Steem Power, should a user want to convert back to the base currency of Steem, it will need to occur in 104 weekly conversions.\n\nThe second smart contract is called Steem Dollars. This is a debt-like instrument that promises to distribute $1 worth of Steem to the token holder at some point in the future.\n\nScott explained:\n\n""[This is] the blockchain telling the holders of Steem Dollars that, at any point in the future, the blockchain will convert their Steem Dollars into a dollar’s worth of Steem after a seven day conversion process.""\n\nThis seven-day conversion process is meant to minimize the ability to create arbitrage attacks by market timers. If the Steem Dollars were convertible to Steem immediately, a user could take advantage of a difference in price, convert their Steem Dollars into regular Steem and earn more than the $1 worth the smart contract intended for it.\n\nBecause it is a stable debt instrument, users who hold Steem Dollars miss out on any Steem price increases. If Steem is worth $1 and this conversion took place, the individual would receive 1 Steem for every Steem Dollar they owned. If Steem rose to $2, the individual would receive 0.5 Steem for every Steem Dollar they owned.\n\nTo compensate for the locked value, Steem Dollars accrue interest. At time of story, users that hold Steem Dollars will earn 10% a year in interest, paid out in Steem Dollars.\n\nRewards for writing and curating\n\nThere are two methods of earning Steem on Steemit.\n\nThe first is by writing a blog post. As that blog post accrues votes, the amount of Steem that will be distributed to the writer increase.\n\nHowever, every vote on the site is not worth a flat amount of money. Instead, the amount earned is based on both the number of votes an individual receives and the amount of Steem Power a voter has.\n\nFor example, if one user had 1,000 Steem Power and another had 10,000 Steem Power, it\'s clear that the latter has a more powerful account than the former. The effect of each of those two people voting on a piece of content is not equal; specifically, the user with 10,000 Steem Power\'s vote is worth more.\n\nThis has resulted in the development of a sort of whale chasing culture, whereby writers hope to convince the large Steem Power holders to give them upvotes. A vote by Scott or Larimer has been seen to increase the value of a post by hundreds of dollars, resulting in a pile-on effect where others chase the post.\n\nTo incentivize this sort of voting, there is also the curation reward paid out in the form of Steem Power. If a post does well, you earn more Steem Power than if a post doesn’t do well, thus incentivizing you to only vote for content that you believe is high quality.\n\nFurther, not every vote from the same account is equal in value. Voting on multiple pieces of content reduces the strength of each of your votes depending on how much time passes between each vote. Scott explained voting power by comparing it to certain video games.\n\nHe said:\n\n""It’s a lot like Diablo or something where you have mana. What happens is, if you\'re casting a lot of spells, your mana decreases and then it generates over time. The same is true of voting power. You have to put some thought into votes because you don’t want to waste your voting power.""\n\nThere are two reward pool distributions.\n\nThe first is approximately 12 hours after the post has been submitted. The reward, denominated in US dollars, is released to the writer divided evenly between Steem Power and Steem Dollars. Voters receive the reward entirely in Steem Power. The second reward pool distribution occurs one month later.\n\nDelegated proof-of-stake\n\nA blockchain without security is not one anyone would have faith in.\n\nSteemit gains its security from a delegated proof-of-stake algorithm, first developed for Larimer\'s BitShares project, which is a variation of proof-of-stake. A true proof-of-stake algorithm, such as peercoin, relies on those who hold the currency to verify transactions.\n\nThe more currency held by a wider variety of people, the more secure the network is.\n\nIn a delegated proof-of-stake system, the community votes for individuals, called witnesses, to be responsible for verifying transactions.\n\nThe easiest way to think about it is proof-of-stake is true democracy similar to ancient Athens. Delegated proof-of-stake is more of a democratic republic, such as the US. By that logic, witnesses are like Congressmen, elected by the community to be responsible for securing the network.\n\nHowever, the analogy ends there, because witnesses can be kicked out of their job for not doing it, something the US Congress has been immune to for some time.\n\nScott said:\n\n""It’s a paid position. We\'re not talking about four-year terms. We\'re talking about people with very specific jobs, which are to produce and verify blocks.""\n\nIn total, there are 21 witnesses responsible for creating and signing blocks of transactions each time a block is made. The first 19 are voted for, as described above. Then there is a 20th witness, which is a random witness who might not have been in the top 19. The 21st witness is a miner doing typical proof-of-work.\n\nIn the Steemit white paper, the authors write:\n\n""This process is designed to provide the best reliability while ensuring that everyone has the potential to participate in block production regardless of whether they are popular enough to get voted to the top.""\n\nNew, but growing\n\nSince catapulting in value to over $400m, Steem has cooled to an approximate market-cap of $157m, but this still makes it one of the six largest cryptocurrencies on the space.\n\nWhile there are certainly naysayers, the reality is that Steemit continues to see more people signing up and participating.\n\nHowever, it’s not simply Steemit the social media site, but also the blockchain that has experienced tremendous growth. Scott said that entrepreneurs and developers have already created 50 different tools, such as Catch a Whale (which tracks where whales have recently voted) and SteemMarket (which lets users buy, sell and rent goods with Steem).\n\nNed said:\n\n""The people showing up to use this are going directly to the blockchain. We don\'t have the authority to tell them not to. In fact, we implore it. What we set out to do is build an ecosystem and that’s exactly what’s happening.""\n\nWhether they stick around past the excitement, though, remains to be seen.\n\nIf the stories of people paying off bills, buying family members washing machines and going on vacations is any indication, Steemit might have found a niche for content creators looking for ways to generate income.\n\nDisclosure: The author posted several articles on Steemit in conjunction with writing the report, for which he earned $2,400 in Steem.\n\nSocial media hero image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But that isn\'t stopping IBM and some of the world\'s most conservative businesses from tapping into its technological underpinnings.\n\nSpecifically, Big Blue is interested in the blockchain -- the mechanism bitcoin uses to publicly record transactions. Today\'s businesses each have their own records, slowing transactions and triggering problems figuring out who\'s right when there are disagreements. But the blockchain approach is more cooperative by providing a consistent record that members of a network can see.\n\n""The blockchain is about distributed trust,"" said Arvind Krishna, a senior vice president at IBM Research\'s Almaden lab, speaking Thursday at a 30th anniversary event.\n\nThat may sound as exciting to you as the development of double-entry bookkeeping more than 1,300 years ago, but it could bring big rewards to businesses by eliminating confusion and financial shenanigans. You should care about those problems, since they ultimately get passed on to the consumers through higher prices or slower shipment of the goods we want to buy.\n\nThe blockchain uses what\'s called a shared ledger, a database spread across several linked computers so no single company has sole control. Encryption technologies govern data to make it clear who paid whom and why.\n\nEnlarge Image IBM\n\nIBM plans to start using blockchain in its own financing business starting in September, easing difficulties that crop up in purchases involving a dealer, a manufacturer and a customer. The company says disputes bog down 25,000 of the 2.5 million transactions between IBM\'s clients. Those disagreements could include which tax rate to pay or which products were actually ordered.\n\n""We believe half the disputes can be resolved automatically,"" Krishna said.\n\nIBM likes blockchain but isn\'t touching the bitcoin project itself where the technology first arrived. Bitcoin has been plagued with multiple thefts, yo-yoing value, governance problems and an unsavory connection to the Silk Road drug marketplace.\n\nIBM is steering clear of bitcoin for technology reasons: Krishna doesn\'t believe in one vast blockchain with anonymous transactions, but instead sees blockchain as useful for smaller networks of companies doing business together.\n\n""I think there will be thousands of blockchains,"" he said, not one, and not millions. On each, the identity of each party is clear, and encryption keeps transaction details private except to those who have permission to see details.\n\nIn July, IBM opened a blockchain research center in Singapore, one of the world centers for financial activity. It\'s also the first contributor to an open-source blockchain software project called Hyperledger, offering 44,000 lines of code in January.\n\nIBM and Microsoft offer blockchain services for those who want to embrace it. IBM has 2,000 partners evaluating it, too, and some like French bank Crédit Mutuel Arkéa have committed to using it.

Once this downtrend signal is completed, more sellers could jump in the game and push for a test of the recent lows at $565.\n\nBitcoin price could find resistance at the descending trend line connecting the latest highs of price action since August 10, as this lines up with a former support zone around $580. A move past this area could still draw resistance from the dynamic inflection points around the moving averages.\n\nStochastic is still heading up, which suggests that buyers are still in control of bitcoin price action for now but could let sellers take over once the oscillator reaches the overbought region and turns lower. Stronger bearish momentum could even lead to a break of the previous lows and a drop to new ones around $550.\n\nMarket Events\n\nUS retail sales data missed expectations on Friday but the dollar managed to advance against bitcoin price as risk aversion may have taken over. In these market scenarios, traders generally prefer safe-haven assets like the dollar versus higher-yielding and riskier ones like bitcoin.\n\nHeadline retail sales was flat while core retail sales posted a 0.3% drop. Producer prices also missed expectations, with the headline figure showing a 0.4% decline and the core figure printing a 0.3% drop.

The currency only works when the user’s computer targets a TLS-enabled website. TLS stands for Transport Layer Security, a cryptographic protocol for secure Internet communication.\n\nResearchers Eric Wustrow at the University of Colorado Boulder and Benjamin VanderSloot at the University of Michigan published a paper, “DDoSCoin: Cryptocurrency with a Malicious Proof-of-Work” that presents a proof-of-work DDoS currency that allows miners to prove their participation in sending requests to a targeted webserver.\n\nThe authors said they were not publishing a working altcoin that uses the proof-of-DDoS, but rather a conceptual description of one.\n\nProves Bandwidth to Target Domain\n\nCryptocurrency continuously provides proof-of-work replacements, the paper noted. Providing access to arbitrary resources, however, remains challenging. DDoSCoin provides a way to prove the use of bandwidth to a target domain.\n\nThe authors noted they hope this concept encourages others to innovate proof-of-resource puzzles.\n\nDDoSCoin demonstrates maliciousness inherent to a cryptocurrency’s design, turning the notion of what constitutes a “useful” proof-of-work around.\n\nProof-Of-Work Requires Consensus\n\nProof-of-work DDoS can replace proof-of-work in a cryptocurrency setting if there is a consensus on what victims the attackers want to target. The conceptual altcoin provides such a consensus using two mechanisms: 1) PAY_TO_DDOS, which allows a bounty to be set for targeting a certain domain, and 2) proof-of-stake updates to a list of valid victims.\n\nThe DDoSCoin proof of work incentivizes miners to send and receive large amounts of traffic to and from the target to produce a valid proof of work. The proofs can be verified easily, and the original miner can claim a reward that can be sold for other currencies. Botnet owners and other attacks can directly collect rewards for assisting in decentralized DDoS attacks.\n\nMiners create a large number of TLS connections to a target webserver. They use the server’s signed responses as proof of a connection.\n\nIn modern TLS versions, the server signs a client-provided parameter at the time of the handshake, in addition to server-provided values from the connection’s key exchange. This allows the client to prove its connection to the server. The signed value the server returns is not predictable to the client and is distributed randomly.\n\nRewards Attacks on TLS Hosts\n\nDDoSCoin rewards those who launch DDoS attacks exclusively on TLS-enabled hosts. Only 56 percent of the top 1 million sites support TLS, according to Alexa, a resource on analytic tools. The number of websites that support TLS is expected to increase.\n\nDDoSCoin allows miners to choose victim servers by consensus using a proof-of-stake protocol. Instead of specifying a single website or a static list DDoSCoin that the miners target, selecting them by consensus enables the choice target to be made collectively by DDoSCoin participants.\n\nBecause DDoSCoin uses transactions similar to bitcoin, trustless cross-chain transactions can allow DDoSCoins to be traded for bitcoins without requiring a trusted third party intermediary. Hence, even outlawing DDoSCoins from exchanges would not prevent a black market from getting around sanctions.\n\nRewarding Malicious Behavior?\n\nThe authors acknowledged their work introduces an idea that could incentivize malicious behavior. They noted they have taken precautions to limit any possible harm.\n\nFirst, in demonstrating their proof-of-concept and evaluating their proof-of-DDoS code, they only attacked websites they own. Furthermore, they have not published a working altcoin that uses this proof-of-DDoS, but a conceptual description of one.\n\nThey wrote:\n\nWe believe it is important to fully disclose potential attacks, even those that require the development of an altcoin to execute. This is especially important in the face of the impending commitment to the design of TLS 1.3, and compounded by how long TLS/SSL protocol versions stay in active use.\n\nWith bitcoin, the amount of miners’ collective computational effort provides no useful problems other than securing the currency from the attack, the authors noted. This distributed computation is a waste of CPU resources. Hence, researchers have proposed altcoins to provide more beneficial proofs of work providing capabilities beyond securing the underlying currency.\n\nCompatible with Current TLS\n\nDDoSCoin is not compatible with versions of TLS before 1.2 (including SSL) since the server’s key exchange signature does not include the client_random or any client-provided values. In earlier versions, the only value provably coming from the server (i.e., signed by a key tied to the victim’s identity) does not have any commitments from the client about the previous block, or the transactions that should be included in the block.\n\nIf DDoSCoin accepted blocks where only a server signature met a target difficulty, a miner could steal another miner’s found block (and the block reward) by changing the transactions and forwarding the block.\n\nTo allow victims to be temporarily selected for DDoS, DDoSCoin allows bounties for targeting specific servers. To do this, DDoSCoin introduces a new payment opcode, PAY_TO_DDOS, to be used in transactions subject to certain constraints. This opcode takes two arguments in an output script: a string representing a domain name the payer wants to have attacked, and a target difficulty corresponding to the number of connections the payer wishes to be made.\n\nOnce this transaction is stored in a valid block, anyone can collect its reward by creating a connection to the specified victim server and getting a response meeting the given target difficulty. These connections are made in a way similar to the way miners connect to victim servers to create blocks.\n\nAuthors Tested Proof-Of-Work\n\nThe authors tested their proof-of-DDoS function against a quad-core TLS server under their control, running nginx (an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server) serving the default page, and connected to their attacker over a local Gigabit Ethernet network.\n\nWhen running their miner, the CPU consumption of the server quickly reached 100% utilization on all four cores, while the attacker only required approximately 30% on a single core.\n\nThis produced more than 3,000 TLS connections per second and slowed response times of the webserver significantly. The authors used Apache benchmark with 1,000 connections with a concurrency of 50 to quantify this. They tested the server under normal conditions (with no miner running) and under DoS (miner running).\n\nThe average server response time increased by more than a factor of six when the miner was running.\n\nAlso read: ZENEDGE debuts always-on DDoS protection, sees benefit for crypto exchanges\n\nVictims Can Defend\n\nThe paper noted that victim websites can use several methods to defend against DDoSCoin miners. Websites can simply disable TLS 1.2 entirely, and only support earlier versions of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. While older versions of TLS 1.0 clients can still be vulnerable to a certain attack, most modern clients have mitigations for this attack.\n\nThe downside of disabling support for TLS 1.2 is losing the means to negotiate authenticated encryption cipher modes with clients, which could undermine the performance of implementations that have hardware acceleration for such modes.\n\nWhile significantly changing existing deployed versions of TLS is unrealistic, it could be possible to influence the design of the TLS 1.3 standard to make it incompatible with DDoSCoin.\n\nWebsites could thwart DDoSCoin by participating in the mining themselves. Since the victim website will have local access to its private key, the victim will have an advantage over remote clients. The victim could mine enough DDoSCoins to mint a proof-of-stake block that removes itself from the list, or increase the difficulty of mining a block high enough that a remote miner has a small chance of succeeding.\n\nFinally, websites could take legal actions against mining operations. Publishing a proof-of-DDoS block in the DDoSCoin blockchain could reveal a miner’s intent to attack a service for financial profit. If the victim can log their traffic, they can find the IP address of the party given a published proof-of-DDoS block.\n\nThe paper noted that many altcoins have alternate proof of work innovations, and it explores some of them in detail.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

This event took place on Saturday, 9th July, when the 420,000th block was mined.\n\nStrong market sentiment\n\nStill, that wasn\'t to say there weren\'t notable developments in the market\'s fundamentals.\n\nIn July, market sentiment was stronger on average than in any other month in 2016, according to figures provided by bitcoin trading platform WhaleClub. During the month, 81% of total position volume was long.\n\nThis figure nearly doubled January’s figure of 43% and far surpassed February\'s 55% total.\n\nPast that, it was notably higher than the 62% that sentiment averaged during the first seven months of 2016.\n\nThe trader optimism that existed in July was also illustrated by WhaleClub confidence data, which measures the percentage by which a particular day’s position sizes were larger than average. Confidence averaged 82% during July, higher than any other month in 2016 except February, when it reached 83%.\n\nWhile July\'s confidence measure nearly doubled every month in 2016, it did not sharply exceed the other monthly confidence figures the way sentiment did. The lowest confidence figure observed for the year was 68% in June, and the remaining months registered figures between 71% and 74%.\n\nMarket sentiment was particularly strong leading up to the halving, as 89% of total position volume was long between 1st July and 8th July, according to additional WhaleClub data.\n\nDuring this period, confidence averaged 82%. These figures not only exceeded those for July as a whole, but far surpassed the sentiment and confidence measures for the first seven months of 2016, which were 62% and 63%, respectively.\n\nDuring this time, bitcoin prices rose to as much as $704.42 on 3rd July, nearly 5% from the opening price of $672.48 on 1st July, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals.\n\nThe digital currency’s price had recently suffered a “sudden and intense” decline from nearly $800 to $550, and ""the price rise back to $700 was a natural market response"" as traders took advantage of the depressed price that existed before the halving, said Zivkovkski.\n\nHe emphasized that before the price dropped more than 13%, Whaleclub registered a record long-short ratio of 22 to 1, which pointed to an abundance of market participants having long positions open.\n\n""No new money entered the system, and following a few days of low volume and failure to reach new highs, low entry buyers triggered a large sell off by taking profit,"" he said.\n\nImpact of halving\n\nWhen the much-awaited halving finally took place 9th July, bitcoin prices fell to as little as $626.87, 11% lower than the monthly high.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, spoke to how the digital currency was bound to suffer a fallback.\n\n""The halving is what drove prices from around $400 to almost $800,"" said Enneking. ""[This effect] was not lasting, however, with an almost immediately retreat back after the fact to $700 and then $600.""\n\nEven though bitcoin prices declined following the halving and remained subdued for a few days after the event, the markets remained bullish.\n\nWhaleClub data showed that in July, 81% of total position volume was long and confidence stood at 76%.\n\nMining production\n\nAnother area market observers had pointed to when emphasizing the potential drawbacks of the halving event was mining production.\n\nAs miners faced the possibility of generating less revenue, some analysts voiced concerns about the long-term viability of some companies.\n\nAnalyst Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead at investment manager ARK Invest, said these concerns proved overblown. ""Hash rate trends since the halving have been reassuringly stable,"" he said.\n\nStill, he suggested that there perhaps isn\'t enough evidence to suggest all halving events will be similarly smooth for the network.\n\n""That said, if the hash rate stays flat over the coming years, then it actually gets cheaper to attack the network due to the deflationary effects of technology,"" stated Burniske. ""Hence, watching the hash rate with each halving of the block reward will be critical to assessing the efficacy of long term incentives for miners to support the network.""\n\nUsing a basic analysis, Burniske estimated that capitalizing a 51% attack would currently cost $680m. Given this figure, he emphasized that the mining network has remained “extremely robust” throughout the halving.\n\nMarket developments\n\nWhile the halving – and the sentiment surrounding this event – grabbed the lion’s share of the attention in July, market observers pointed to other developments as contributing to bitcoin\'s price fluctuations.\n\nSome analysts asserted that the Brexit, the highly visible exit of the UK from the European Union (EU), affected bitcoin prices in July.\n\nWhile British voters approved the proposal of leaving the EU during the month, the situation could help heighten global macroeconomic uncertainty for years to come. The nation’s officials have not yet triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which is needed for the UK to formally begin the process of exiting the EU.\n\nOnce they do, they will have two years to negotiate new agreements with trade partners.\n\nAnalysts see the EU as a potential influence on the price of bitcoin ahead.\n\n""I think the Brexit has something to do with the relative stability (or conversely, lack of uptick) of BTC, as the industry in general sees it as an opportunity for bitcoin (and other meta-assets) to play a larger role in the UK economy,"" said Rik Willard, founder and managing director of Agentic Group LLC.\n\nAlgorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff also weighed in on the situation, stating that the Brexit probably boosted bitcoin in July, thought he said the US election, and the strong polling observed by Republican nominee Donald Trump were also factors.\n\nYuan manipulation\n\nAnother development that grabbed the attention of digital currency market observers was the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) manipulation of the yuan. The central bank has maintained a currency peg to the dollar for years and reduced this fixed exchange rate more than once in 2016.\n\nThese policy moves generated significant visibility, as some market observers asserted that devaluing the yuan would prompt Chinese market participants to put their funds into bitcoin as a store of value.\n\nOlaf Carlson-Wee, founder of digital asset hedge fund Polychain Capital, commented on this situation.\n\n""Chinese markets usually drive bitcoin prices, especially when it\'s a bull run,"" he said.\n\nWee believes July saw some portion of wealthy Chinese citizen using bitcoin to escape capital controls, which in turn helped drive the market.\n\nWhile many have pointed out the relationship between yuan devaluation and bitcoin demand, in July, the bank boosted the yuan’s daily fixing.\n\nHayes described this as ""a price negative factor"".\n\nChild with muscles image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Even global financial powerhouse JP Morgan Chase & Co. has taken notice:\n\nBlockchain is becoming a C-suite issue. What roles do CEOs, COOs & CTOs need to play? https://t.co/Pr98906QBs pic.twitter.com/F3GAelPcsh — J.P. Morgan (@jpmorgan) August 1, 2016\n\nThe blockchain was pioneered by pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Many consider it to be one of the most significant breakthroughs in computer science in decades.\n\nBut is it actually, well, fast? Bitcoin\'s block time is approximately 10 minutes, but during times of heavy network congestion, the Bitcoin network can take an hour or longer to settle funds.\n\nNewcomer Ethereum, which some see as a potential rival to the Bitcoin network, may soon have subsecond confirmation times thanks to a next generation technology built for it called the Raiden Network. We spoke with Raiden creator and CEO/founder of brainbot technologies, Heiko Hees, to learn more:\n\nIn your IBT interview, you suggested to the reporter Ethereum may be better suited for fast off chain payments than Bitcoin, why is that?\n\nFirst of all, Bitcoin is not ready yet. They need to fork to fix the transaction malleability issue. Currently no one knows if and when this will happen. Also Raiden supports any (ERC20 compatible) token that is defined on Ethereum. We\'ll see many different tokens like AppCoins, reward points, reputation points, stable coins, even fiat money pegged coins on Ethereum.\n\nAnother improvement over Bitcoin Lightning are ""smart transfers"", i.e. transfers which only execute if a certain condition on-chain is satisfied. It basically extends the smart contract capabilities to the Raiden network allowing for advanced off-chain based applications like, betting or financial derivatives.\n\nWhat other applications or use cases could you see emerging from such fast and cheap transfers. Are any game designers, banks, etc looking at off chain, specifically, to speed things up?\n\nBasically all blockchain based applications that want to scale to real world usage will benefit from Raiden. It can be used for applications like asset trading in gaming or finance, retail payments, micropayments for content (think the next YouTube or Spotify where creators are directly paid for every second consumed). But it\'s also suitable as an infrastructure for cheaper, faster and more secure correspondent banking. Especially the upcoming machine-to-machine economy will likely use blockchain as an easy to integrate permissionless infrastructure. Some expected applications of Raiden here will be decentralized energy trading, on-demand payments for bandwidth, API-access, sensor data or access to property and infrastructure.\n\nOne last question, what are the security implications? From a layman\'s viewpoint, how is Raiden keeping everything secure until it gets reconciled on the main chain?\n\nIt works by having deposits in a smart contract on the blockchain which are used to transfer tokens according to what the participants of a channel signed as updated balances off-chain. This is secure as long as a node is online and can monitor the channel, so that it does not get closed with wrong (i.e. old) signatures provided by the other node in the channel. But challenging invalid settlement information can easily be delegated to a third party without having to trust it with the funds. Off-chain multihop transfers (which are needed as there usually is no direct channel between sender and receiver) are secured by using so called hashlocks. In a transfer Alice to Charlie where Bob is in the middle and needed to help facilitate the transfer, this prevents Bob from running away with the funds sent by Alice.\n\n\n\nThere is one known attack vector which is spamming the blockchain with transactions so that an invalid settlement can not be challenged. This can be mitigated by having an Oracle contract which would signal if a there was an attack, and settlement timeouts would be increased to deal with the attack.\n\nThanks for your time.

08/15/2016,"['Crypto-currency exchange Bitfinex‘s plan to impose losses on all its trading clients for the theft by hackers of $72 million in Bitcoin rests on two flawed pillars, according to lawyers.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based exchange said on Aug. 2 that hackers had stolen 119,756 bitcoins from some clients’ accounts, the second-biggest such hack in dollar terms, and later said it would spread the losses across all its customers, whether or not they had been hacked or even held bitcoin.\n\nIt said customers would forfeit 36% of their holdings and be given “BFX tokens” instead that could be redeemed by the exchange or converted to shares in its parent company iFinex.\n\nBoth elements of the plan are open to legal challenge, lawyers said.\n\nSee also: Bitcoin Is Not Money, Miami Judge Rules\n\nImposing losses on customers who were not hacked appears to go against the company’s terms of service, said Ryan Straus, a Fenwick & West lawyer who advises financial technology companies on regulation and co-authored the U.S. chapter of a book on bitcoin law.\n\nThe terms state “bitcoins in your multi-signature wallets belong to and are owned by you,” which Straus said implied a special banking relationship with clients that the Bitfinex plan would breach.\n\n“The depository … is obligated to return, on demand, the same monetary objects deposited,” he said, quoting a line from his book.\n\nThe exchange’s tokens could also be problematic, said Zach Zweihorn, a lawyer at DavisPolk who specializes in U.S. securities and trading laws.\n\nSee also: Hacked Bitcoin Exchange Considers Splitting Its $72 Million Loss Among All Users\n\nThe way they are currently being described – redeemable by the exchange or convertible to shares in iFinex – places them somewhere between a bond and a security and makes it highly likely that issuing them and trading them would require licenses in the U.S. that Bitfinex doesn’t have.\n\n“If they are issuing an equity interest in their parent company, I don’t really think the fact that it’s evidenced through an electronic token … really changes the analysis of whether it’s a security,” said Zweihorn.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission did not return a request for comment.\n\nBitfinex did not respond to requests for comment on either issue.\n\nSee also: Why Hong Kong Shares Just Touched a 9-Month High\n\n“ROBBED”\n\nBitfinex‘s website acknowledges there are “protocol level details” still to be worked out for the tokens, and that U.S. residents can sell but not buy them for the time being.\n\n“I feel like I was robbed,” a 33 year-old investor who had a five-figure U.S. dollar amount on the platform told Reuters.\n\nHe said he took a 36% “haircut” across all assets, including U.S. dollar reserves, and as a U.S. trader he couldn’t properly deal in the IOU token.\n\n“Basically they took customers’ funds in order to try to stay afloat. Nowhere in their terms of service did it mention that this was a possibility,” said the user, who works in the financial services industry.\n\nSee also: Japan Is Said to Be Negotiating with Banks to Borrow At a Zero Rate\n\nBitfinex is nevertheless hoping that traders will be patient and accept that they won’t get a better deal if legal challenges force it into liquidation.\n\n“This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context,” it told traders in a blog post a week ago, while the tokens gave them some hope of ultimately recovering their losses.\n\nTraders will be aware of the fate of Tokyo-based crypto-currency exchange Mt Gox, which suffered the biggest bitcoin theft of all time in 2014, and consequently went bankrupt. Traders have not recovered any losses, and court proceedings are still ongoing.\n\nSee also: How Hackers Plan Attacks and Hide Their Tracks\n\n“People are afraid to see their assets completely frozen if they sue Bitfinex too early,” said 28-year-old Nathan Bourgeois, who is based in France and moderates a 2,000-member traders’ messaging group called Whaleclub under the username dr Helmut.\n\nHe said he thought people would agree to the deal if there was a chance of getting some of their money back.\n\nBut Patrick Murck, a fellow at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, said the Bitfinex plan was unlikely to survive a legal challenge.\n\n“It might be a pyrrhic victory. You might still end up with less money,” said Murck, who is also co-founder of the Bitcoin Foundation and its former general counsel, but the “odds are fairly low” that nobody will test it in court.\n\n“It takes one grumpy hold-out … to blow the whole thing up,” he said.', 'Image: iStockphoto/Tsokur\n\nA recent report from the World Economic Forum predicted that Bitcoin\'s underlying technology, blockchain, will soon occupy a central place in the global financial system, with 80% of banks predicted to start blockchain projects by 2017, and $1.4 billion invested in the technology in the past three years.\n\n""Rather than to stay at the margins of the finance industry blockchain will become the beating heart of it,"" Giancarlo Bruno, head of financial services industries at the World Economic Forum said in a statement. ""It will help build innovative solutions across the industry, becoming ever more integrated into the structure of financial services, as mainframes, messaging services, and electronic trading did before it.""\n\nFor those not familiar, blockchains—also called distributed ledgers—are databases where all digital currency transactions are recorded and stored. They are updated and maintained by a network of users, rather than a single company or government. This technology could offer a way to move money and track transactions across borders in a more secure and efficient way, experts said.\n\nSEE: UK government using blockchain to track welfare spending\n\nHowever, the report noted, before full adoption is possible, several factors must be addressed, including an uncertain regulatory environment, lack of standardization efforts, and the need for a formal legal framework.\n\nEnter international law firm Steptoe & Johnson, which last week announced the expansion of its blockchain practice into a multi-disciplinary practice designed to help clients in all industries manage application of the blockchain in their businesses. In addition, the firm will soon accept Bitcoin as payment for fees itself.\n\nThe firm\'s expanded practice is led by Jason Weinstein, who led the Department of Justice\'s cybercrime enforcement efforts, and Alan Cohn, the former Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary.\n\n""With this expansion of our practice, we are taking the next step from being counsel to the Bitcoin and blockchain industry, to being counsel to companies across all industries who will be affected by the many applications for blockchain and distributed ledger technology,"" Weinstein said. The firm anticipates a range of companies across many different industries, including financial services, insurance, energy, transportation, and telecommunications.\n\nSince Bitcoin is the currency in which many companies transact business on the blockchain, accepting it as payment is an important way for the firm to become part of the Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem, Weinstein said. It will also help the firm better understand the problems associated with Bitcoin and therefore better counsel clients on using it, he added.\n\nBlockchain\'s growing importance\n\nBitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology were introduced in the midst of the 2007 financial crisis. The value of the currency grew by more than 1,000 fold in the past five years, according to a June ARK Invest report. This means that a person who invested $1,000 in Bitcoin at the start of 2011 would now be a millionaire.\n\nRoughly seven million people worldwide hold a material amount of Bitcoin, ARK estimates. Meanwhile, over 500 million people hold stocks directly or indirectly.\n\n""We see blockchain and distributed ledger technology being as important in the future as the internet is today,"" Weinstein said. ""In essence, the blockchain is the internet of value, and enabling transactions of value in the same way that we currently exchange communications and data enables not only advances in value transfer but also helps unlock the potential of other innovations like the Internet of Things.""\n\nSteptoe & Johnson is currently representing companies in investigations by the US Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and advising financial institutions on anti-money laundering compliance issues related to digital currencies.\n\nThe firm also co-founded the Blockchain Alliance, a coalition of 25 blockchain companies and 25 regulatory and law enforcement agencies including Interpol, Europol, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the FBI. The alliance\'s goal is to educate enforcement agencies about digital currencies and the blockchain.\n\nTechies, criminals, and businesses\n\nBitcoin\'s journey can be summed up in three general stages, said Chris Burniski, blockchain analyst and products lead at ARK Investment Management. First, the technology people who were amazed by the way it could serve as money over IP. Then, the rise of the Silk Road and using Bitcoin as a means of exchange for internet and often black market transfer.\n\n""Now, we\'re seeing it exiting that stage and becoming more mainstream,"" Burniski said. ""While its reputation has remained as being this dark market currency, really the ways in which it\'s being used now are far past that.""\n\nFor example, OpenBazaar is essentially a decentralized Amazon, and Coinbase offers a place to buy and sell Bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nAccording to Weinstein, businesses looking to adopt blockchain technology should as themselves the following three questions:\n\nAre the needs of your industry and your company best served by the public blockchain, a private or permissioned blockchain, or a hybrid of the two? What are the key legal, regulatory, and public policy implications of adopting blockchain technology for your company and in your industry? What specific steps_operational, technical, and legal—will you need to take to effectively experiment with, and ultimately adopt, blockchain technology for your business?\n\nCompanies should also seek out a reputable merchant that is well-funded and has a good track record, Burniski said. It\'s also imperative that they have strong security systems, especially in light of the Bitfixnet attack earlier this month, in which hackers stole nearly 200,000 Bitcoins from the exchange firm, worth about $70 million.\n\n""Bitcoin is decentralizing trust in the transfer of value,"" Burniski said. ""It allows us to connect with global communities much more directly and for lower cost, often more quickly than we would be able to otherwise. It opens up more channels for trade and ultimately leads to wealth creation.""\n\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\n\nBlockchain, Bitcoin\'s underlying technology, will soon become a central system in the global finance market, according to a Friday report from the World Economic Forum.

Nigerians using these services will have to pay high fees for sending money across international borders. Hence, bitcoin offers a solution since it allows people to send any amount anywhere at any time at negligible cost, usually in less than five minutes.\n\nFiat Remittances Cumbersome\n\nSending fiat currency across borders requires sending the funds from an originating bank through a third party that provides the money transfer service, such as Ria, MoneyGram or Western Union, which charges fees and often incur glitches in delivering the funds to the receiver.\n\nThe need for remittances is growing because families increasingly have members living in different countries who often have an urgent need of money. Parents can send their children who might be studying abroad instantly and safely.\n\nEntrepreneurs in Nigeria frequently need to send funds to business partners in other countries. With bitcoin, they no longer have to wait days to receive funds or spend a lot of time waiting in line at a bank or an ATM.\n\nAnother Attraction for Bitcoin\n\nThe government’s crackdown on money transfer services is not the only attraction bitcoin offers in Nigeria.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria also planned to ban credit and debit card purchases abroad this year to slow the flow of foreign exchange out of the country, CCN reported.\n\nThe central bank fixed the exchange rate in February and blocked access to foreign currencies for certain kinds of imports in June.\n\nThe restrictions make it harder to make purchases from foreign retailers both online and while traveling abroad. Those most likely to notice the change include wealthy Nigerians looking to buy luxury items on the international market. Some luxury goods have already become scarce in Nigeria as a result of the Central Bank’s ban on using foreign exchange for certain imports.\n\nAlso read: Nigerian banks to ban credit and debit card use abroad\n\nForeign Exchange Crisis Aids Bitcoin\n\nNigeria’s foreign exchange crisis demonstrates how using bitcoin can solve some of the monetary problems involved in international trade. Bitcoin becomes a promising alternative to the naira (Nigeria’s currency) because it makes international purchases more convenient for consumers while also easing the strain on Nigeria’s foreign exchange reserves.\n\nBuying bitcoin in Nigeria is easier than in some other countries in Africa thanks to the Nairex electronic currency exchange. The Nairex exchange allows a user to exchange cash for bitcoin and sell bitcoin at competitive market rates.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A Chinese court has awarded damages against China’s popular bitcoin exchange, OKCoin, after it was alleged that the company was aiding criminal money laundering and wasn’t properly registered.\n\nThe court decision only affects OKCoin’s China-based bitcoin exchange, OKCoin.cn, and not its international exchange, OKCoin.com; however, it’s the first significant ruling by a court against a bitcoin exchange. OKCoin’s parent company is Lekuda.\n\nAccording to court documents, Huachen Commercial and Trading Co. Ltd., the defendant, claimed that an individual had defrauded it of 12 million Chinese yuan ($1.8 million USD), which was then laundered to buy bitcoin before the money was withdrawn to a Macau account.\n\nThe court found that the criminal had managed to set up several accounts on OKCoin by utilizing fraudulent identity documents that had been bought online. As a result, the court disapproved of OKCoin’s procedure when it comes to reviewing users’ identities, stating that opportunistic criminals can use the bitcoin exchange to launder money with no fear of a reprimand.\n\nNo Bitcoin Legislation in China\n\nPresently, there is no legislation in place to regulate bitcoin in China; however, the court decision found that OKCoin was working illegally, stating that its license doesn’t cover its bitcoin exchange business.\n\nAccording to a posting on Reddit, the judgement said that OKCoin “should register at the administration of Industry and Commerce and get a business license.”\n\nIt added:\n\nLekuda company registered business scope only includes such areas: technology development, transfer of technology, technical services, technical marketing, consulting and investment management. Trading bitcoin for profit-making purposes is beyond the range permitted by the administrative authorities.\n\nInitially 80 percent of the damages were awarded to the defendant company; however, this was later brought down to 40 percent.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Adam Vaziri is the founder of Diacle, a ""finreg"" compliance and legal consultancy based in London and Hong Kong, and a member of the UK Digital Currency Association.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Vaziri discusses the European Banking Authority\'s new proposals for digital currency regulation and why they could make starting a bitcoin exchange more onerous than opening a bank.\n\nThe European Banking Authority (EBA) wrote an opinion on the application of its 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD) to virtual currency exchanges and wallets last week.\n\nA response to recommendations from the European Commission, the EBA\'s remarks notably mention that VC exchanges and wallets operating in multiple countries in the EU ""may […] be required to be registered or licensed in each Member State in which they intend to provide VC-related services"".\n\nThe seemingly small aside in the nine-page response is notable, as such a measure would be akin to the state-by-state registration process that VC exchanges have to do in the US.\n\nThis is due to the fact that there are no passporting rights granted under 4AMLD – understandable, as the regulations are not designed to facilitate the movement of goods, services or capital, but are simply motivated by the public policy imperative of protecting the EU from terrorism and crime.\n\nAt Diacle, we take the view that a member state-level registration is an unnecessary burden placed on VC exchanges and wallets.\n\nA small VC exchange and wallet operating in the EU would not only need to register as an ""obligated entity"" in its home state, but in every other member state of the EU where it operates – an unfathomable task. This particular duplication of registrations would create a disproportionate burden on VC operators compared with other regulated institutions in the EU.\n\nA prepaid card is issued by an electronic money institution (EMI) licensed by the Electronic Money Directive. That EMI can \'passport\' the services it provides to other member states seamlessly through its home state regulator.\n\nYes, indeed, that EMI still needs to adapt its customer due diligence (CDD) to any additional requirements of AML or counter-terrorist financing (CTF) laws in the host state. However, the EMI does not need to apply directly state-by-state for AML/CTF registration.\n\nFinancial implication\n\nIf a standard authorization or licence takes six to 12 months to obtain, then what of an AML/CTF registration?\n\nUsually that process can take between three to six months, however, the VC exchanges and wallets will now need to contend with language barriers, administration and bureaucratic fragmentation in each member state where it wants to do business.\n\nIt is sadly ironic that registering in 50 states in the US may be easier as at least the process is in one language. The same state-by-state requirement in the EU will mean the VC exchange operator will need to contend with 24 official languages.\n\nParadoxically, the process of state-by-state registration will be far more cumbersome in terms of capital and operational resources than if the VC exchange and wallet simply applies to become an EMI or, at a push, a challenger bank.\n\nThis surely must be an unintended consequence.\n\nThe EBA interprets this implication as a matter of fact, however our view is that this must, at the very least, be unintended as the result is absurd considering the following preamble statements from the EU Commission.\n\nThese read:\n\n""Due account was taken of the need to respect the freedom to conduct a business, and while there will be an impact on market players becoming obliged entities and currently not performing any customer due diligence (CDD) on their customers, the ability to operate a virtual currency exchange platform is not affected by the proposed amendments.""\n\n\'Fit and proper\'\n\nThe above position is worsened when you consider the requirement that, according to the EBA, the ""amendments proposed by the Commission introduce a requirement that those who hold a management function in, or are the beneficial owners of, [VC exchanges and wallets] are fit and proper persons"".\n\nAlthough evidently the EU Commission has not fleshed out what \'fit and proper\' test will be in practice, it is reasonable to expect that this will be an assessment of the background of the applicants and provision of documentation (passport, proof of address) possibly notarized, apostilled and translated.\n\nImagine a VC exchange or wallet having to do this in 28 member states.\n\nThe average costs of producing documentation that has been officially translated will be a minimum of €1,000 to €2,000 per owner or manager.\n\nNext steps\n\nIf the EU Commission were to accept the EBA’s interpretation that all VC exchanges and wallets will need to register individually in each member state where they operate, this would be the biggest regulatory blunder for a region expounding the job creation opportunities of FinTech.\n\nAgain, it would be absurd to assume that the intention of the EU Commission is to make it cheaper to set up a licensed payment institution or electronic money institution or even challenger bank than be regulated under 4AMLD as a VC exchange or wallet.\n\nOvernight, the overhead of VC exchanges and wallets would increase exponentially, meaning most likely the beginning of January 2017 could see a full consolidation of the VC exchange and wallet market in the EU.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Diacle\'s blog and has been republished here with the author\'s permission.\n\nDog on horse image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

And the bitcoin skeptics — of which there are many — are at it again. In late June, Citi Research released a report that asked, ""Could the Bitcoin Blockchain Disrupt Payments?""\n\nThe researchers\' short answer — unsurprisingly — was: no. That short answer, however, was shortsighted. Even more troubling is that Citigroup is not alone in its critique of the cryptocurrency.\n\nWe have a little secret for all of those who once again have predicted bitcoin\'s imminent demise: They\'re wrong. Instead of simply shouting that point over and over again, let\'s carefully examine some of the faulty arguments cryptocurrency naysayers, when they are naying, seem to be saying in unison.\n\nThe U.S. and Western Europe are well served by existing financial systems.\n\nHere, we mostly agree. Existing centralized payment systems can work for those within the established system. But what of the 2.5 billion people excluded from the established system? For the disenfranchised living in places banks cannot or will not serve, bitcoin can change lives.\n\nThe naysayer argument here (and well articulated by Citi) is a familiar established financial refrain: ""We do not believe bitcoin is superior to existing centralized payment systems."" Yet, can we really argue the superiority of a model unavailable to so many?\n\nIndeed, the established financial industry has left over a third of the world\'s population without access to checking accounts, saving accounts or credit cards. It doesn\'t have to be that way.\n\nBlockchain technology provides the opportunity to rewrite the financial services sector and create a more global, open and efficient system. Such a system can provide unparalleled access to a stronger economic future for billions across the globe. It can help a woman in Afghanistan who seeks to hold value independent of the men in her life, or a doctor in Venezuela who is watching the bolivar become worthless every day but can secure assets by holding their value in bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin can\'t reach parts of the world that lack internet services.\n\nA working paper from the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development is just the latest in a lengthy string of commentary from naysayers articulating the loudest and longest-running argument against bitcoin: limited connectivity. In the paper, researcher Brett Scott writes:\n\n""There remain doubts as to the viability of Bitcoin within countries with poor infrastructure and technology access. Besides the issue of establishing trust in an otherwise poorly understood digital token system, there needs to [be] consistent internet availability and efficient electrical grids.""\n\nLet\'s put this issue to bed once and for all: Connectivity is not an issue. The reason is you don\'t need a computer connection to be connected. There are at least 7 billion mobile phone subscriptions in the world — that means there are almost twice as many people with cell phones than bank accounts or working toilets. The combination of digital currency and mobile phone connectivity promises to fundamentally overhaul a banking system to the benefit of those excluded from the current so-called superior model.\n\nThe ""last mile"" cost makes bitcoin a last resort.\n\nThe naysayers, including Jamie Dimon, argue that bitcoin will never be a major competitor to the U.S. dollar.\n\nAmong the reasons often cited, particularly by money transfer operators, is that bitcoin doesn\'t solve certain cost challenges associated with remittances. While bitcoin can streamline the value transfers, it does not affect what is known as the ""last mile"" costs of making the conversion into local currency.\n\nAgain, we agree. But it\'s a misguided point because it assumes that conversion is a foregone conclusion, when it\'s not. Believing conversion is the ultimate goal is a view deeply rooted in the Western banking paradigm. However, in many parts of the world, holding value in bitcoin is preferable to the volatility of local currency. Note the aforementioned Venezuelan doctor who has no interest in converting bitcoin to bolivar anytime soon.\n\nBitcoin\'s two ""incurable"" diseases.\n\nThe number of bitcoin obituaries is almost endless. One of the chief causes of death are bitcoin companies\' lack of resiliency in such a volatile market. Bitcoin has only been around since 2009 so it\'s neither time-tested nor stable.\n\nBill Gates has flagged resiliency/volatility as a bitcoin pitfall. But what the naysayers and obit writers overlook is that youth bears no relation to resiliency, just as age does not suggest security. Don\'t believe us? One word: Brexit.\n\nIn the immediate wake of Brexit, bitcoin experienced record transaction volumes as it became a safe haven for Brits watching the pound tumble. Despite the cryptocurrency\'s increased use and relative youth, bitcoin\'s value remained stable because its global nature made it more resilient to geo-political risk.\n\nAnd yet the naysayers continue to nay. But as we have said, they\'re getting it all wrong. Is bitcoin perfect? Of course not, though we would argue that it\'s perfectly accessible — an attribute lacking in our ""superior"" centralized system.\n\nCould the bitcoin blockchain disrupt payments? The right answer is a resounding yes.\n\nArthur Levitt Jr. is former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Peter Smith is CEO of Blockchain, a provider of blockchain technology and bitcoin wallets.', 'A preliminary sale that would find bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner continuing under new ownership has been approved, according to those close to the deal.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, court-appointed receiver Nils Åberg today confirmed that a sales agreement was reached on Friday with a Swedish firm called GoGreenLight. Founded for the purpose of completing the acquisition, GoGreenLight is a new sister company to Borderlight, an Uppsala-based IT and telecom firm founded in 2000.\n\nNotably, Borderlight\'s Sten Oscarsson said that GoGreenLight could continue to operate KnC\'s bitcoin mining pool and data centers once it assumes leadership.\n\nOscarsson told CoinDesk:\n\n""We will run the mining to the extent that it is profitable, but in addition to our core business.

It’s most likely the case that we’ll be a player.""\n\nOscarsson said his firm is aware of the struggles KnCMiner had in adapting its model from one focused on direct-to-consumer sales to one focused on industrial mining, but that it could acquire talent as part of the deal.\n\n""It was one of the few operations that had successfully competed on the world market,"" he continued.\n\nWhile GoGreenLight is in discussions to hire members of the KnC team, no previous owners are involved with the acquiring firm, he added.\n\nThe developments follow an update from Åberg in July in which he suggested KnCMiner, which entered bankruptcy in May, was considering multiple buyers.\n\nHowever, he indicated the GoGreenLight team provided the most compelling of all proposals.\n\n""This was the best alternative for the estate and the creditors,"" Åberg said.\n\nÅberg further said that ""additional considerations"" needed to be finalized before the sale was properly concluded.\n\nImage via KnCMiner\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A Bikram yoga practitioner, he asked Sarah Curry, owner of the local Bikram Yoga studio on Islington Street, if she\'d accept payment from him in Bitcoin and she said yes. In May, Zeiler filmed a video of Curry adhering a sticker to the front door of the yoga studio announcing the ""cryptocurrency"" is now accepted there.\n\n""I work with the number one banking technology in cyrptospace, so I\'m always working on expanding the Bitcoin technology,"" Zeiler said. ""I have a lot of friends on the Seacoast who use it and I want people near me to accept it.""\n\nZeiler\'s latest convert is Street restaurant in Portsmouth, which also now accepts payment by Bitcoin. Street employee Jim Karlotski said Zeiler was dining in the Islington Street restaurant one evening when he asked about hosting a meeting for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Karlotski said the 15 to 20 new customers for the meeting would mean hundreds of dollars in new revenue for the restaurant, but he was told payment would have to be in Bitcoins.\n\n""We already use iPads for our point of sale system, so they recommended a few apps to ease the process along and eventually we settled on Bitcoin Checkout by BitPay,"" he said. ""Imagine if you had a customer coming from Japan and paying in yen. They would hand you a credit card, the bank would automatically convert the yen into U.S. dollars, and the end result would be the same as if they paid with a U.S. credit card. The process with BitPay is very similar, except with a cellphone camera and a QR code instead of a credit card. The customer pays for the service with Bitcoins, the BitPay company converts it at the current exchange rate, and U.S. dollars are deposited into your bank account.""\n\nKarlotski said setup took about a half hour ""and now we have the structure to accept Bitcoins in the future.""\n\n""At the end of the day, it\'s really just business and another way to attract customers and keep them happy,"" he said.\n\nZeiler said he uses purse.io to purchase anything from Amazon with Bitcoin and usually gets a 20 percent discount doing it.

For business owners accepting Bitcoin, Cyr said, they might choose to hold onto it, ""or they might process it into cash at the end of the day.""\n\n""There\'s really no downside to accepting (Bitcoin) if converting to cash via a service,"" he said.

08/16/2016,"['Startups working with blockchain and bitcoin technology around the world raised close to $300 million (£231.2 million) in funding in the first 6 months of the year, according to Juniper Research.\n\nOver 30 startups raised $290 million (£223.5 million) but over a third went to just three companies in big ticket fundraises: Circle, which raised $60 million (£46.2 million) in June; Blockstream, which bagged $55 million (£42.4 million) in February; and Digital Asset Holdings, which raised $50 million (£38.5 million) in January.\n\nBlockchain is a type of database technology first developed to underpin digital currency bitcoin. Instead of one central database of who owns what, blockchain allows for a network of identical, linked databases that talk to each other and are updated simultaneously.\n\nEvery time someone wants to make a change or add something onto the blockchain (the shared database), the majority of members of the network must sign off on it. This cuts out the need for middlemen in transactions, because the fact that everyone signs off means trust is built into the system.\n\nBy cutting out middlemen, cost is reduced. The process of the group signing off on transactions should also theoretically reduce error.\n\nBitcoin\'s original blockchain is used to record bitcoin transactions — but the tech could theoretically be used to record just about anything that involves transactions. Applications are being developed for everything from share records to art and diamonds.\n\nBanks and financial institutions spending thousands on proof of concepts using the technology, issuing countless white papers, and joining industry-wide bodies to figure out how to use the protocol.\n\nJuniper says banks are increasingly active in the bitcoin and blockchain investment space. But Juniper\'s Dr Windsor Holden says in a statement:\n\n""While blockchain technology offers the potential for increased speed, transparency, and security across an array of verticals, there has to be rigorous and robust roadtesting in each unique use case before any decision is taken.""\n\nJuniper\'s investment stats come a week after the World Economic Forum declared that blockchain technology ""will fundamentally alter the way financial institutions do business around the world"" and ""become the beating heart"" of finance, following a year-long study of the technology.', 'In disrupting the legacy financial systems, Tether Inc. in conjunction with partner exchanges have announced the launch of EURT, a “euro-coin” which is tradeable and transferable over the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nTight spreads and low fees\n\nThe partners involved in this latest development are Omnipotent Layer Foundation, who specialise in developing Blockchain-based technologies, and peer-to-peer cryptocurrency platform, OpenLedger.\n\nPatrick Dugan, Foundation board member, says:\n\n“We’re enabling price discovery and remittance for the world’s most liquid market over the Bitcoin Blockchain, which means we can provide a very tight trading spread combined with the lowest exchange fees in the industry.”\n\nUsing this vehicle, the Omni Layer Foundation will engage market making in the EUR/USD pair across both decentralized exchanges and other exchange partners.\n\nA strong backbone\n\nAccording to the announcement, similar to USDT which trades between half a million and a million USD a day across more than 5 exchanges, EURT is fully backed by a banking trust in Taiwan on a 1 to 1 basis of deposits to coins issued.\n\nTether currencies are issued using the Omni Layer protocol, which like the Bitcoin Blockchain itself, is fully decentralized and allows low cost trading with no custodian or middleman directly over the blockchain.\n\nTether Euros provide the least expensive way to transfer digital assets priced in USD into euros, Tether EUR can be deposited on OpenLedger and credited for SEPA transfers, and on Coinsbank for debit card payments.\n\nThe OmniDex charges traders taking liquidity 0.05 percent of each trade, which will accrue to holders of the Omni cryptocurrency automatically.\n\nEveryone seems to be involved\n\nAlso claimed in the announcement is that the supply of Tether Dollars has grown to just over 6.6 Million USD backed by bank deposits in Taiwan, and Tether Euros are being made available in conjunction with OpenLedger, which will provide SEPA transfer functionality on redemption.\n\nOpenLedger provides a decentralized exchange over Bitshares that complements Omni Layer’s Bitcoin-based platform with faster execution, and hosts all the major assets issue using Omni, including MaidSafe, Synereo, Agoras Tokens, as well as Tether.\n\nAnother aspect of this partnership is the integration of Tether with Coinsbank (www.coinsbank.com), an Edinburgh-based exchange and fintech solutions provider, who will enable debit card payments for holders of Tether USD and EUR.\n\nCoinsbank claims to average over 2M USD in daily trading volume for Bitcoin against the euro, dollar and pound.', ""According to an Apple Insider report published on August 9, a disturbing trend has emerged on Apple’s App Store as a series of malicious copycats of well-known Bitcoin wallet apps became available to download. Some of the fake wallets looked quite similar to the real thing but were specifically tweaked to steal bitcoins from unsuspecting users. As a result some $20,000 reportedly ended up in the pockets of scam artists before Apple was able to filter and remove the apps from its store.\n\nThe relative “success” of the fake apps and the ease at which they were manufactured and distributed, for some, calls into question Bitcoin’s almost self-evident Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ethos. Most Bitcoin wallets have been open source, which allows anyone to verify the legitimacy of the product. But as witnessed, it also allows scam artists to effortlessly copy that same software, to make minor adjustments in order to steal funds.\n\nAt least one popular wallet, the Jaxx wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum and most recently Dash, has employed an approach to this ”open” model that is unusual in the space. While all the code is still openly and publicly visible on Jaxx’s website, this is limited to a type of view-only mode. The code can potentially be reviewed and verified by anyone but it cannot be copied and re-used — or at least not very easily.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Jaxx CEO Anthony Di Iorio explained:\n\n“Part of the reason we do this is that we, as a company, necessarily have our operating costs and it’s not easy to make money when you give away your code for free. But the other part is that this strategy makes it harder for malicious actors to impersonate our wallet. As a company, we want to offer quality control and that’s impossible if anyone can simply take and tweak your product. We’re trying to find a balance between transparency and keeping our software proprietary, and that includes the insertion of certain friction points to discourage people from stealing our code.”\n\nOne of the wallets that was affected by the introduction of fake wallets, and which saw a fraudulent copycat appear in the App Store, is GreenAddress. GreenAddress has always been entirely open source which indeed means the code can be trivially copied and tweaked. Yet, developer Lawrence Nahum continues to stand behind the FOSS model.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Nahum explained:\n\n“A wallet with all its code out in the open makes it easier to impersonate; sure. But even if a wallet is not open source, I don't think you can really stop these kinds of imposters in the end. There would still be ways to mimic wallets, especially if the code is open for review. And not distributing source code also means it will have less scrutiny and therefore less security. Most developers I know don't review code on a web page.”\n\nDi Iorio, however, does not agree that limiting the availability of Jaxx’s code represents a trade-off in scrutiny or security.\n\n“Even if a wallet is completely open source, there’s no way to tell that the app you download from the app store is the same code,” he said. “And really, there are very few people who actually care. Almost no one verifies the code, even if it is open source. 95 percent of users just want their wallet to work. Whether or not it’s open source doesn’t change that.”\n\nApple removed the fake wallets from the App Store after the Bitcoin community — including Nahum himself — filed complaints with the tech giant. This, along with Apple’s own review process, appears to at least prevent long-term harm.\n\nNahum acknowledged this solution is not water-tight either.\n\n“Walled gardens like Apple’s don't scale much, as someone needs to check and verify every single app that’s introduced,” Nahum said. “And malicious apps can improve too. The fake wallets we have seen were easy to detect by a trained bitcoiner. But in the future there may be wallets that make no copyright infringement and are only selectively malicious.”\n\nAs such, says Nahum, a clear-cut solution is perhaps not available and users will simply need to be aware of potential copycats and act accordingly.\n\n“We will notify Apple for any bad app we see. But I personally advise people who download apps to get them from a verified source. Check whether the developer is known, look up reviews, see if it’s submitted to bitcoin.org, always double check URLs and names and make sure you’re downloading the real thing.”"", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Affiliates get access to easy-to-use management tools, Cerber\'s Bitcoin laundering system, as well as the ransomware itself. Each day, eight new Cerber ransomware campaigns are launched, she said, with over 150 affiliates at current count.\n\nBy comparison, she said, the other major brand of ransomware common today is Locky.\n\n""With Locky, there is just one team of threat actors,"" she said. ""They don\'t share their malware with anyone else so all the income goes to them. With Cerber, it acts like a business that has branches all over.""\n\nIn addition to their 60 percent cut, there is also a 5 percent referral bonus for affiliates who recruit new members.\n\n""My assumption is that this means that there will be more and more such services, more and more attacks, even more than today,"" she said.\n\nCheck Point gathered this data by identifying the IP addresses that infected computers used to communicate with their command-and-control centers.\n\n""It\'s pretty easy to intercept this traffic,"" Horowitz said. ""Then you can really get the details of who the targets are and which campaigns are currently running.""\n\nFor example, Check Point was able to determine that the malware authors are probably based in or near Russia.\n\n""There are no infections in Russian-speaking countries,"" she said. ""And in the configuration of the ransomware, the authors, as default, chose not to operate on machines or PCs that have Russian as their default language.""\n\nBy not infecting the machines of users in Russia, the authors may be attempting to evade law enforcement in that country, she said.\n\nIn addition, Check Point was able to extract the the unique Bitcoin wallet identifiers assigned to each victim in order to track how many actually paid the ransom, and then to follow the money from those wallets to one central wallet, then to a network of other wallets that are part of a Bitcoin mixing service, and then finally to their destinations.\n\n""We followed these hundreds of thousands of different wallets,"" she said. ""I think that this is the first time that security researchers can say for sure what percentage of victims pay the ransom.""\n\nit was surprising how few people paid the ransom, she said. Previous estimates by other researchers have put payment rates at much higher levels.\n\n""But it still gives the threat actors enough money,"" she added.\n\nWhen analyzing the Cerber malware, Check Point also found a vulnerability in its decryption mechanism.\n\nThe company has published a decryption tool that exploits this vulnerability.', 'In the world of online trading, bitcoins and binary options go hand-in-hand. Using these two together will continue to gain popularity.\n\nA few years ago (in 2008, to be exact,) there were two major innovations that entered the world of trading, and these two innovations changes the world of finances as we know it: Bitcoins and binary options trading.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin?\n\nSimply put, a bitcoin is a form of digital currency. There is no physical entity of a bitcoin; instead, this form of currency relies on balances that exist on a public ledger that is encrypted with both public and private keys.\n\nBitcoins were created as a means to facilitate online payments without the need for a centralized authority. Because they are decentralized and they offer anonymity, this form of currency has become quite popular.\n\nWhat is Binary Options Trading?\n\nBinary options trading is a very simple and straightforward trading platform. Basically, it is a yes/no trading platform that is designed to have a payout of a fixed amount. In other words, a trader in the binary options market decides whether a certain asset will go up or go down in price over a fixed period of time.\n\nBitcoin Binary Options Trading\n\nMany innovative brokers have realized that there is a new opportunity in the trading market and have come up with different ways to trade binary options using bitcoins.\n\nBasically, there are two ways that bitcoins can be trade with on the binary options market:\n\nBitcoins can be used as the medium of exchange Bitcoins can be used as an underlying asset\n\nIn order to use bitcoins as a medium of exchange, a trader needs to trade various underlying assets within the financial markets using bitcoins. For instance, a trader may trade the USD/Euros currency pair and predict whether it will rise or fall within a specified period of time. If the trade is successful, instead of being paid in a standard currency (USD or Euros,) the trader will be paid in bitcoins.\n\nThere is another option for trading bitcoins, and that involves using them as an underlying asset. Bitcoins can be traded on specialized exchanges, and just like the US dollar or the Euro, the exchange rate for bitcoins goes up or down, depending on the demand for them.\n\nThe Benefits of Using Bitcoins\n\nThere are many great reasons to use bitcoins for binary option trades. One of the biggest benefits, by far, is that the cost of the transaction will be far lower than any other type of online payment. Additionally, bitcoins allow you to earn extra bitcoins, which can increase your investment. Since bitcoins are traded and their value fluctuates based on their demand, a trader can shield himself from the fluctuations by earning more through the profits that are earned during the process of trading.\n\nIn the world of online trading, bitcoins and binary options go hand-in-hand. Using these two together will continue to gain popularity, which makes for a very promising and bright future for traders who trade binary options with bitcoins.\n\nCover Image via Flickr', 'Bitcoin is going more mainstream in Africa, if the United Nations has anything to do with it.

Some people think bitcoin is a way to address and fix that problem.', 'Image: Shutterstock, edited by author\n\nAn 18-year-old Redditor, a mysterious benefactor, a marriage proposal, and a $600,000 cryptocurrency lottery: these are the ingredients for a strange story, even by the usual standards of the bizarro identity games that plague bitcoin.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a Reddit user pretending to be the hacker who stole $65 million from a bitcoin exchange announced that they would give away 1,000 bitcoins, worth around $600,000 USD, to one lucky person in a week\'s time. The post received more than 7,000 comments from hopeful people posting their bitcoin addresses, but the consensus was that the lottery was likely a troll or a scam.\n\nThat user—""rekcahxfb,"" or ""BFX hacker"" backwards, referencing the name of the hacked exchange, Bitfinex—proved everybody wrong. Well, sort of. Maybe.\n\nLast Thursday morning, reckahxfb announced that Reddit user ""TheTwistedTwo"" was the winner, and 1,000 coins were transferred to the bitcoin address that TheTwistedTwo posted in the lottery thread. The coins were almost immediately moved from that wallet to another wallet. The third wallet has a public note attached that reads: ""Please send me some money. I\'m very poor.""\n\nRedditors and bitcoin experts alike guessed at numerous explanations for the lottery, which ranged from clumsy money laundering to pure trolling. Either way, many suspected that reckahxfb had simply sent the coins back to himself, using the alias TheTwistedTwo, or to someone he knew under that name (more on this later).\n\nAs it turns out, the skeptics were half-right: reckahxfb and the TheTwistedTwo did know each other before the lottery, TheTwistedTwo\'s so-called publicist relayed ""verbatim"" in an interview over Snapchat. But it wasn\'t money laundering, or trolling, or some kind of weird scam, TheTwistedTwo told me. Instead, she claims it was a marriage proposal.\n\n""His intent was to gain this exact attention, and that intent was to propose to me""\n\n\n\n""We met on Reddit a few months ago,"" she told me in a Snapchat message, relayed by a friend of TheTwistedTwo who claimed she is TheTwistedTwo\'s publicist. (The story was that TheTwistedTwo was driving, and so had her friend type texts for her.) ""We became friends, and I\'m flying to visit him next month,"" she said.\n\n""His intent was to gain this exact attention,"" TheTwistedTwo continued, ""and that intent was to propose to me.""\n\n""On another note, would you like an invitation to the wedding?"" she wrote.\n\n\n\nDespite this apparent relationship, TheTwistedTwo, who told me she is 18, said that she is convinced the lottery really was random, and that reckahxfb ""proved it"" to her. To TheTwistedTwo, the whole fiasco is ""a love story,"" she told me.\n\nAs for whether she will give the coins back to her so-called beau, TheTwistedTwo said she is thinking about it—or giving the sum to charity—since ""money would ruin the authenticity of our friendship.""\n\nWhen I asked if it was at all possible that she was being manipulated by an apparently very wealthy man into giving the lottery money back to him, as skeptics predicted would be the case, TheTwistedTwo replied that if there is a power imbalance in the relationship, it favours her. When I asked her to elaborate, she wrote ""I\'m not in the position to disclose such [sic].""\n\nIt\'s worth noting that her first message to me over Snapchat after I identified myself as a journalist was: ""He told me not to talk to you.""\n\nThe two women sent this Snap from the car, we blurred their faces to protect their identity.\n\n\n\nIt\'s a nice story, but there are some major holes in this plot. The first is the question of why rekcahxfb would pretend to be a multimillion-dollar hacker in the first place. The prevailing theory for this is that by sending the coins to an accomplice pretending to be a normal user in a public lottery, rekcahxfb could retrieve coins tied to an earlier crime while severing any obvious ties between themselves and their hacker identity and pinning it on the Bitfinex hacker in the process.\n\nBut the Bitfinex hack happened just this month, and the lottery coins were moved into rekcahxfb\'s wallet in 2013 and had been sitting there ever since, meaning that rekchaxfb couldn\'t be the Bitfinex hacker.\n\nI reached out to Jonathan Levin from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, who told me that there is ""definitely no connection with the stolen [Bitfinex] funds.""\n\nThe coins appear to have originated with Mt. Gox, a massive bitcoin exchange that imploded after a hack left it insolvent in 2014, Levin told me. The coins were transferred to the lottery wallet from a wallet controlled by Inputs.io, a mixing service designed to obfuscate the origins of bitcoins, which went belly-up in 2013 after it lost more than 4,000 coins in a series of hacks.\n\nDespite this rather thick air of impropriety, TheTwistedTwo told me that her husband-to-be acquired his coins legitimately.\n\n""There are laws about giveaways in every state [...] I wonder how that all will play out if the identity of the person running the giveaway becomes known publicly""\n\nThe next major problem is that I haven\'t been able to communicate with rekcahxfb directly, which in the worst case could mean they simply don\'t exist, and TheTwistedTwo\'s story still doesn\'t make a whole lot of sense. First off, regardless of whether her friend is really a publicist or it\'s just a joke, you\'d expect someone who just got handed $600K in bitcoin over Reddit would keep a slightly lower profile.\n\nMoreover, the friend told me that ""this isn\'t [TheTwistedTwo\'s] first brush with media,"" but brushed me off after I asked her to elaborate.\n\nFinally, when I asked TheTwistedTwo whose wallet she immediately transferred the lottery coins into, she said that it was a ""cold storage"" wallet, meaning that the coins were transferred to a hard drive that never touches the internet, mitigating the risk of the coins being stolen in a hack.\n\nEarlier on Reddit, TheTwistedTwo wrote, ""I\'m technologically challenged, and I\'m not even really knowledgable [sic] about [bitcoin].""\n\nWhen confronted about the disparity between her professed and actual technical abilities, TheTwistedTwo wrote, ""My possibly [sic] fiance is an excellent teacher. I don\'t know everything but I\'m good at following instructions.""\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that, at this point, it\'s unclear what went down in one of the weirdest public spectacles in bitcoin\'s long history of them.\n\n""He should have just proposed like a normal person, instead of running a fake giveaway that caused everyone else to waste their time,"" hacker and Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer wrote me in an email.\n\n""By the way, there are laws about giveaways in every state,"" he continued. ""You can\'t just run one by announcing that you\'re running one—giveaways of this magnitude might require posting bond, they might require ensuring that people under a certain age cannot participate, etc. I wonder how that all will play out if the identity of the person running the giveaway becomes known publicly.""\n\nWhatever happened, at least I got a (possibly fake) wedding invite out of it.', 'Bitfilm Production is the creator of a new Bitcoin show called “Captain Drakins”, the first TV series related to the crypto world. The two characters for this show are Captain Drakins himself and his sidekick, Nick the parrot. In each episode, they explain the main Bitcoin topics in a funny and simple way as the show intends to reach a young audience, including students.\n\nCaptain Drakins Goal\n\nThe show is set in a pirate world to better understand the “anti-system” attitude of the crypto world. In fact, the Captain and his parrot perform in a 3D studio decorated as a pirate ship and on the screen behind Drakins there will be several different visuals which illustrate the topics he is explaining.\n\nBitfilm Production wanted to create a documentary useful for the youngest public, who have heard of Bitcoin but are not using it yet. The main goal of Bitalo and Bitfilm is to make this audience aware of the practical advantages of this cryptocurrency in daily lives, as well as its potential to reduce the power of banks.\n\nAaron Koenig, founder and CEO at Bitfilm Production, explained:\n\n“We want to educate people about Bitcoin in an easily understandable and entertaining way. We chose the pirate motive where we make some jokes about banks and capitalists, because our main target group are young people who care about social justice and a fair distribution of wealth. These are undoubtedly good motivations, but if you don\'t understand how the economy works, you might suggest the wrong methods such as government regulations and interventions into the free market. We want to show that a financial system like Bitcoin which works without mighty middlemen, such as banks and governments, is better for making the world a better place.""\n\nCaptain’s first episode\n\nHere below you can watch the first episode of the “Captain Drakins” show, titled “Selling Products for Bitcoin”. During this episode the Captain shows how Bitcoin works and how it is different from a bank account, that needs a lot of tools and approvals, not to talk of issues related to fraud. Instead of this, Bitcoin is simple to use and it doesn’t matter if you are a student based in Berkeley or a guy who lives in an African village.\n\nThis first episode was sponsored by Bitalo, as Koenig explained.\n\nHe says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Bitalo has sponsored the first four episodes and might sponsor more, as they are offering a wide range of Bitcoin related services, such as a marketplace, a decentralised exchange and a Bitcoin based AirBnB. Each of the first four episodes cover an area in which they are active. So it\'s not classical advertising as the main focus lies in explaining a certain topic. The sponsor\'s product or service appear in the show in a subtle and natural way. As Bitalo obviously does not cover all aspects of Bitcoin, we are open for other companies to sponsor more episodes. So for an episode which explains how Bitcoin mining works, a cloud mining service would be the perfect sponsor - that\'s a very efficient and credible way to reach potential clients.”\n\nOne episode will be published per month, so the second episode called “Offering your services for Bitcoin” will be online in August, and the third episode “Changing Bitcoins into Conventional Money” in September. More episodes are already in pre-production, so ideally “Captain Drakins” will be a long running series which covers every aspect of Bitcoin.\n\nYou can watch Episode 1: Selling Products for Bitcoin here.', 'California\'s legislature has once again shelved a plan to regulate businesses in the digital currency industry.\n\nReintroduced after nearly a year of dormancy earlier this month, Assembly Bill 1326 has now been referred back to the state\'s Rules Committee and Banking and Finance Committee – effectively freezing its progress.\n\nWord first emerged on Friday that the measure would be delayed, and a representative for the Banking and Finance Committee has since confirmed to CoinDesk it will not be heard in the legislature again this year.\n\nShe said:\n\n""It\'s being delayed for this year.""\n\nThe move will prolong the already long road for the bill, which was first introduced in 2015 and saw months of back-and-forth debate take place between industry representatives, state lawmakers and technology advocacy groups.\n\nHowever, statements from representatives of the legislature suggest that the bill, at least in some form, will return during the legislative session next year.\n\nBanking and Finance Committee spokesperson Mark Farouk told American Banker that the bill ""is dead for this year"", suggesting that significant change was in the works. Farouk reportedly indicated that work by the Uniform Law Commission on a template for digital currency regulation could also play a role.\n\n""I think there\'s going to be a lot of things that are going to be modified,"" he told the publication.\n\nThe Banking and Finance Committee did not offer comment on whether the law would be revisited in 2017.\n\nCalifornia state capitol image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The incident would force the exchange to impose a 36% haircut on customer holdings, a move that continues to stoke controversy.\n\nFor now, Bitfinex has suspended its use of tools provided by security partner BitGo and has begun utilizing a hot cold wallet set up to maintain funds. As part of that reassessment, Bitfinex said that it is currently storing most of its funds in so-called cold wallets – accounts that are not connected to the Internet.\n\nThe company also responded to criticisms circulating via social media alleging it had not contributed funds to help fuel the recovery.\n\nThe exchange said in the statement:\n\n""Management has committed all reserves of the business with a view to making our customers whole. Moreover, any principals and employees of the business with any property on Bitfinex were subject to the loss allocation... We assure everyone that we feel the loss acutely, both as a company and as individual customers.""\n\nElsewhere, Bitfinex acknowledged that it ""held back certain amounts"" to pay for security and financial audits, as well as a security system rebuild.\n\nThe exchange said some of its reserves would also be devoted to repurchasing digital tokens issued to customers to make up for losses.\n\n""We are actively engaged with efforts to convert certain qualifying token-holders to shareholders of Bitfinex and to redeeming the remaining BFX tokens through a combination of new capital and earnings,"" the company said.\n\nLost executive image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

More exchange traders are joining the bandwagon and the market outlook says there has been a rise in the value amount of Bitcoin traded after the first half of this year.\n\nFollowing a market research in July, BitFlyer says its virtual currency exchange has the largest Bitcoin trading volume in the first half of 2016 across Japan as it made a 200,000 registered users breakthrough in June.\n\nIt says about 7.8 million bitcoins (worth about 430 billion yen) was traded within the January and June period in Japan and touts itself as the holder of the number one spot having accounted for 37% share of the market.\n\nFuture uptake imminent\n\nMarket research firm Seed Planning estimates the Bitcoin\'s annual trading volume will soar to 2 trillion yen this year.\n\n""We have noticed a trend where investors who previously traded foreign currencies on margin take up bitcoin trading,"" a company official said.\n\nCEO of bitFlyer, Yuzo Kano, was quoted as saying that the trading volume has been growing at a pace that has not been seen before since this spring.\n\nKano, a former Goldman Sachs trader, is one of the 38 figures from past and present - including Janet Yellen, Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System - who have helped to shape the financial services sector to be celebrated this year 38th edition of Sibos.\n\nHe supports the new digital economy, but also recognises the importance of regulation, for which he is a vocal advocate.\n\nRegulation more Bitcoin-friendly\n\nThe introduction of regulatory measures seems to have been instrumental in the recovery process from the Mt. Gox scandal which has given Bitcoin a bad name in Japan.\n\nIn May, Japan passed a bill that mandated the regulation of Bitcoin and virtual currency exchanges by the Financial Services Agency (FSA).\n\nAbout $4.25 billion (about 430 billion yen) in bitcoins was reported traded in Japan in the January-June half - an increase of about 50 times from the same period in the previous year.\n\nHowever, in July alone, more than 200 billion yen in bitcoins reportedly changed hands. That’s almost half of the recorded trading for six months.\n\nThere are indications that trading may take off as the regulatory framework catches up with more users to give more legitimacy in the public eye.\n\nJapan has risen to become the second Bitcoin market in the world after China, toppling the United States. Earlier, Japanese government officially recognized Bitcoin as a currency.', 'A new physical Bitcoin exchange in Moscow allows people to sell bitcoin for ruble round the clock. Read more...\n\nRussia recently took a far more liberal approach towards Bitcoin than expected. Last week, the Russian government decided not to introduce criminal liability towards mining and usage of the digital currency.\n\nFollowing the government’s move, the cryptocurrency community in the country has started to come up with novel ways of promoting the use of Bitcoin. Few Russian media outlets have picked up the news about an offline Bitcoin exchange that has opened in Moscow’s Novy Arbat Street 8.\n\nUnlike online Bitcoin exchanges and Bitcoin ATMs, this Russian Bitcoin exchange is an office. Open 24 hours, people can drop in anytime to sell their digital currency for Russian ruble. The whole process works just like a forex counter at the airports and train stations.\n\nThis type of exchange model will not only help build trust among new users but also brings in more accountability to Bitcoin transactions. The exchange is being operated by a group well-known as BTC24pro.com on LocalBitcoins. They bring in their experience in the industry to a physical office based exchange operation.\n\nCurrently, it is a one -way exchange, where people can only sell Bitcoin for the ruble. The exchange charges 4% fee over the BTC-e exchange rates for the service during the day. During night hours the transaction fees hit 10%.\n\nThe founders of Bitcoin exchange intend to ensure the legality of the business depending upon the response. The Russian government is currently monitoring the use of digital currency in order to build concrete legislation for it. The regulations are expected to be passed sometime later this year.\n\nEarlier the Ministry of Finance had proposed a prison term of up to 4 years combined with a huge penalty for those exchanging Bitcoin to ruble. Recently, it was decided to consider Bitcoin as an equivalent to foreign currency. However, these legislations are still in the draft phase until approved.\n\nRef: Bankir.RU |Image: NatGeo', 'It’s the week of wallets in the Bitcoin ecosystem with KeepKey and BitPay’s Copay both making announcements. The hardware wallet KeepKey just announced a firmware change that allows wallet users to make trades on the ShapeShift cryptocurrency exchange platform (currently for Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin). BitPay’s Copay wallet app also announced a change that will enable users to purchase Amazon.com gift cards with bitcoin in app.\n\nOn the gaming circuit, blockchain-based platforms are beginning to show how virtual items can be secured as crypto-assets. A limited edition, rare card in the trading card game (TCG) Spells of Genesis developed by EverdreamSoft just traded for approximately $3,700 USD. And, with the intent of producing a platform for TCGs, EverdreamSoft and IndieSquare have teamed up to jointly develop a blockchain-based platform for issuing virtual property (in this case, virtual tradable cards).\n\nAs for the current Bitcoin market, currently BTC is trading at $577.35 USD (BitcoinAverage.com). This comes as a little bit of a dip from last week’s high of $597. Monday this week, Bitcoin market value reached a low of $654 but has since been on the rise again back to the price it holds currently. Much of the current price volatility (and lower market value) can be attributed to the Bitfinex hack that occurred at the beginning of this month (see below for updates on that).\n\nBitfinex releases interim update on recent platform hack and theft\n\nBitcoin exchange Bitfinex (BTXNA, Inc.) has released an interim update on the investigation into a recent hack and theft of bitcoins from its platform—the report is supplemental and outlines current procedure but is still light on details.\n\n“Ledger Labs Inc., a top blockchain forensics and technology firm, is undertaking an analysis of our systems to determine exactly how the security breach occurred and to make our system’s design better going forward,” Bitfinex wrote in its report today. “We engaged Ledger Labs in the hours immediately after the attack happened. The investigation is ongoing. We are also in the process of engaging Ledger Labs to perform an audit of our complete balance sheet for both cryptocurrency and fiat assets and liabilities.”\n\nSo far, Ledger Labs has not discovered the vector of the attack that caused the theft; however, the report outlines that the consultants have managed to give Bitfinex recommendations as to how the platform could be better secured.\n\nThe hack occurred August 2, 2016 and led to the loss of approximately 119,756 BTC (approximately $6.9 million USD); the exchange went offline temporarily immediately afterwards, suspending trades and withdrawals as part of the recovery.\n\nBitfiniex began coming back online August 10 with an announcement that clients of the exchange would be shouldering part of the burden of the theft. This effect, called a “haircut” would see client stashes of bitcoins on the site cut by 36 percent. The funds reduced have been exchanged for BFX, a special Bitfinex token that the company says that it will slowly buy back.\n\nThe Bitfinex report also includes some commentary on the distribution of BFX and the “haircut.” The company notes that two of the top 10 BFX-holders are members of the Bitfinex management team. The company used some virtual ink to respond to criticism that the company is still working to repay customers (and to do so will buy back BFX tokens).\n\nAlso, the report comments that certain qualifying BFX-holders will be converted to shareholders in the company.\n\nKeepKey hardware wallet integrates with cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift\n\nThe crypto cat is out of the bag, according to The Merkle, Bitcoin hardware wallet KeepKey just became the first of its kind to integrate cryptocurrency trading website ShapeShift. As a result, KeepKey users can exchange Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and soon numerous other coins/currencies easily and swiftly with their hardware wallet.\n\n“Today I am proud to announce our partnership with ShapeShift,” the company wrote in its blog. “The KeepKey hardware wallet has become ShapeShift ‘aware’. You are now able to simply exchange between crypto currencies stored on KeepKey, without ever putting your private keys (or your funds they secure) at risk. You can do this all through our KeepKey Chrome extension.”\n\nShapeShift AG is a unique cryptocurrency exchange website that does not require users to register to make a trade. It works as a frictionless system for users to quickly exchange between different crypto coins. Created in 2014 by CEO and entrepreneur Erik Voorhees the service has since launched a browser plugin, mobile app—and it has even survived a hacking and theft.\n\nKeepKey, LLC is one of the few high-quality Bitcoin hardware wallets on the market. As a hardware wallet it competes with SatoshiLab’s Trezor, New York-based Case and the Ledger wallet amid others.\n\nThe ShapeShift trade capability is disabled by default for new wallets using new firmware feature included in all wallets called Policies. In order to start using ShapeShift using the KeepKey wallet, users must first enable that policy. Once activated, the KeepKey wallet’s firmware will go through extra verification steps to confirm requests originate from ShapeShift and that the exchange and refund addresses match the wallet.\n\nBeta testing of this product begins next week. Interested users should contact KeepKey in order to be included.\n\nBitPay gives Copay users the ability to purchase Amazon gift cards with wallet\n\nA new feature of the BitPay, Inc. Copay Bitcoin wallet as of version 2.5.0 allows users to purchase Amazon.com, Inc. gift cards within the Copay app.\n\n“You can purchase Amazon.com Gift Card value in penny increments between $1.00 and $500.00,” BitPay announced on its website’s blog. “Amazon.com Gift Cards never expire and can be redeemed towards millions of items at www.amazon.com, www.myhabit.com, and certain of its affiliated websites.”\n\nTo make this work, BitPay has partnered with Amazon as an authorized reseller of Amazon gift cards and acts as the merchant intermediary when BitPay clients purchase cards.\n\nThe gift cards exist as codes stored in the Copay app. It is important to note, however, that gift card codes are not backed up with bitcoin wallet backups. As a result, the company suggests that Copay users write down or screenshot card number codes if they will not be used immediately to prevent potential loss.\n\nThe current Copay app is available in the iOS App Store, Google Play store, Windows Store, as a Chrome app, for Mac OSX, Windows and Linux.\n\nSpells of Genesis SatoshiCard sold for $3,700 before the game is even launched\n\nSpells of Genesis is a tradable card game (TCG) developed and published by EverdreamSoft SA that represents an interesting experiment in the use of blockchain-based technology to secure virtual property. Every card in the SoG game space is represented by a crypto-asset that can be traded between players.\n\nAccording to The Merkle, one of these cards—known as the SatoshiCard, a much sought-after trading card in the SoG game that is limited edition—traded recently for 1,280 XCP (CounterParty cryptocurrency coin), which would be valued at an estimated 6.65 butcoins or $3,700 USD.\n\nSpells of Genesis cards are intangible, virtual property that exist only as blockchain-based cryptoassets—but as they are secured in this way they cannot be forged or counterfeit and trades become permanent. This means that SoG may become one of the first tradable card games where virtual cards can be traded with the same permanence as physical cards.\n\nAs the game moves towards full launch, uncommon, rare and limited-edition cards will likely rise in value as more players enter the platform. While players are able to create new cards (through a system of transformation in the game that uses groups of cards to make less common cards) a certain rarity will still be enforced for particular cards making them limited resources.\n\nFor further details on the game see SiliconANGLE’s coverage of the Spells of Genesis beta launch earlier this year.\n\nForce of Will: Another blockchain-based TCG launches in September\n\nAlthough not even launched yet Spells of Genesis will soon not be the only blockchain-secured tradable card game (TCG) on the market. SoG developer EverdreamSoft SA is collaborating with IndieSquare, provider of the world’s first and only mobile CounterParty wallet IndieSquare Wallet and developer API, to jointly develop a blockchain-based TCG platform in September this year.\n\nThis jointly developed platform will be used for the Force of Will Battle Simulator app, an online version of popular Japanese card game Force of Will (Force of Will Co., Ltd.). The game developer sells cards in over 30 companies and boasts a ranking of 4th in sales volume in the North America for hobby collectable games.\n\nCounterParty is a blockchain-based technology that allows virtual assets to be issued with a blockchain-based cryptocurrency. It is a versatile blockchain platform for developers to produce platforms that can issue and use crypto-assets—cards from Spells of Genesis is a perfect exemplar for how CounterParty can be used.\n\nAnother takeaway of the platform being jointly developed by EverdreamSoft and IndieSquare is that the platform and API will allow interoperability between games that use the platform to permit tradability of virtual assets (in this case tradable virtual cards).\n\nThe two companies hope that this joint venture will lead to developers looking at blockchain-based technology as part of any application that issues or uses virtual property (which is true of most multiplayer mobile games).\n\nAbout the new platform, IndieSquare said: “By combining IndieSquare’s Counterparty API services with EverdreamSoft’s easy to use dashboard for game management and asset registration, we hope this collaboration will enable a new wave of developers to utilize blockchain game items planting the seed for a generation of games and applications with interoperable assets and items.”\n\nIt’s a brave new blockchain future for Spells of Genesis and Force of Will with EverdreamSoft and IndieSquare’s platform.\n\nPhoto: Dawson/Bloomberg News', 'Juniper Research has revealed in a new study that the total value of Venture Capital investment into blockchain technologies and Bitcoin-related companies in the first 6 months of 2016 totalled $290 million.\n\nThe Future of Blockchain\n\nIn the new report – The Future of Blockchain: Bitcoin, Remittance, ID Verification & Smart Contracts 2016-2021 - it says more than 30 startups received funding within the period and more than a third of all investment was accounted for by three companies.\n\nThey are social payment provider, Circle; sidechain developer, Blockstream; and distributed ledger solutions provider, Digital Asset holdings.\n\nCircle announced a $60M strategic financing from a syndicate of major Chinese investors in June led by Beijing-based VC, IDG Capital Partners.\n\nIn February, Blockstream raised $55 million in Series A funding to further enhance our sidechain technology, expand our operations globally, and support new industry partnerships.\n\nBetween January and February, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and IBM joined 13 other industry leaders across the financial ecosystem in a funding round for Digital Asset to bring its total to more than $60 million.\n\nGrowing support and endorsement\n\nThe growing interest and investment in the blockchain technology was also reported by the World Economic Forum.\n\nIn its the future of financial infrastructure report, WEF says that awareness of the blockchain technology aka distributed ledger technology (DLT) has grown rapidly though significant hurdles remain to large-scale implementation.\n\nAccording to the report, over US$1.4 billion has been invested in the blockchain technology over the past three years with more than 90 central banks engaged in DLT discussions worldwide and 80% of banks predicted to initiate DLT projects by 2017.\n\nSimilarly, the Juniper’s study highlighted the increasing diversification of nascent blockchain deployments, with applications ranging from identity to asset management.\n\nIt also pinpointed the banking sector as being particularly proactive, with several banks having already adopted the Ripple blockchain protocol and others piloting competing solutions.\n\nThough Juniper warned that contents of smart contracts including, potentially, bugs or flaws, would be visible to all the users of any blockchain used, it says a blockchain-based system would substantially reduce the risk of error and the time taken for error checking.', 'Image: BTC Trinkets .com/Flickr\n\nWhen a mysterious group called The Shadow Brokers dumped a bunch of hacking tools and exploits allegedly belonging to an NSA-linked group, it also said they had more, juicier stuff. But to see it, the group warned, someone has to win a strange auction for one million bitcoin, or around $500 million.\n\nThat\'s a lot of bitcoin, which immediately raised a lot of eyebrows. The auction, many argued, was simply a ruse, or a scam. Either way, it\'s not going great.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the auction is 999,998.371 bitcoin short. The bitcoin wallet set up by The Shadow Brokers has only received 15 offers for a total of around $930, and the highest bidder—by far—is from someone who paid 1.5 bitcoin, or around $850.\n\n""Have a feeling nothing will come out of it, but worth a shot,"" said the bidder, who declined to be identified but told Motherboard that they are interested in using the hacking tools and unknown, or ""zero-day,"" exploits that The Shadow Brokers might have in their possession.\n\n""Have a feeling nothing will come out of it, but worth a shot.""\n\n\n\n""The code is outdated, and there are no guarantees I (or anyone) will get anything from this,"" the bidder said in an online chat. ""I do however think that is the most anyone will bid. So, if I get a few 0days, even if old, for $850—that would still be nice.""\n\nThe bidder declined to elaborate on what they intend to use the exploits for. They said that they\'re not interested in reselling them, but using them for their criminal activity, such as hacking routers to intercept people\'s data—logins, for example.\n\nMatt Suiche, the CEO of UAE-based cybersecurity company Comae, who\'s been following the leak since the beginning, is skeptical.\n\n""The auction is a PR stunt,"" Suiche told me. ""Initially I was thinking of bidding too but when I realized they mentioned they wanted $500M USD, it made me doubt about how serious they were on the auction.""\n\nFor Suiche, it\'s more likely the auction was just a way to get attention. But if The Shadow Brokers don\'t get enough bids, and the auction ""is still shitty like now,"" he argued, they might release what they have anyway eventually to prove they have more, and increase their chances of making a profit.\n\nThe auction seems to be set in a way that even if it doesn\'t raise one million bitcoin, the highest bidder—but no one else—gets to see the rest of the files. So the current highest bidder does have a chance if The Shadow Brokers keep their word.\n\n\n\nIn any case, the highest bidder isn\'t holding their breath, but is hopeful.\n\n""If you ask me - in a month it will all be forgotten,"" the bidder said. ""People have short memory, this team will either disappear with the little amount of [bitcoin] and give me nothing, or release another teaser just to try to get more [bitcoin] (which won\'t work)...my bet in [bitcoin] is on the part where they live up to their word :)""\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify that highest bidder of the auction, even if it doesn\'t get to one million bitcoin, would get to see the files, according to the terms of the auction.', 'BITCOIN\n\nAfter almost a year of dormancy, Assembly Bill 1326 or the California Bitcoin License bill, was reintroduced in the state Legislature early this month for a second reading by the Senate. Legislators, however, froze the bill’s progress this week by referring the proposal back to the state’s Rules Committee and Banking and Finance Committee.\n\nA representative for the Banking and Finance Committee confirmed the news to CoinDesk, saying, “[the bill] is being delayed for this year.”\n\nAB1326 was first introduced in the legislature by Assembly member Matt Dababneh in 2015. Since then, it had gone on through several amendments both in the assembly and in the Senate.\n\nMembers of the digital currency community in California are against the bill, which would potentially create regulations that would control the use and trade of digital currency, just like the New York BitLicense. This could mean that bitcoin start-ups in the state—particularly in start-up hotbed San Francisco—may soon find themselves exposed to more red tape.\n\nBut according to Banking and Finance Committee spokesperson Mark Farouk, the bill is undergoing “significant change,” noting that “there’s a lot of things that are going to be modified.”\n\nDigital currency start-up investments reach $300M\n\nA favorable digital currency-related legislation, not just in California, would greatly benefit the thriving blockchain and digital currency start-up sector.\n\nAccording to Juniper Research, start-ups working with bitcoin and its underlying technology around the world have already raised close to $300 million in funding in the first half of 2016 alone.\n\nMore than 30 start-ups received $290 million in funding, but over a third of this investment went to just three companies: social payment provider Circle, which raised $60 million in June; sidechain developer Blockstream, which bagged $55 million in February; and distributed ledger solutions provider Digital Asset Holdings, which raised $50 million in January.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price and trade volume\n\nThe price of bitcoin went up, albeit slightly, only Wednesday, trading at $574.60 with a market capitalization of $9.11 billion and trade volume of $20.63 million.\n\nComments', 'DEA Special Agent Carl Force wanted his money—real cash, not just numbers on a screen—and he wanted it fast.\n\nIt was October 2013, and Force had spent the past couple of years working on a Baltimore-based task force investigating the darknet\'s biggest drug site, Silk Road. During that time, he had also carefully cultivated several lucrative side projects all connected to Bitcoin, the digital currency Force was convinced would make him rich.\n\nOne of those schemes had been ripping off the man who ran Silk Road, ""Dread Pirate Roberts."" That plan was now falling apart. As it turns out, the largest online drug market in history had been run by a 29-year-old named Ross Ulbricht, who wasn’t as safe behind his screen as he imagined he was. Ulbricht had been arrested earlier that month in the San Francisco Public Library by federal agents with their guns drawn.\n\nNow government prosecutors were sifting through a mountain of evidence, and Force could only guess at how big it was. The FBI got around the encryption of Ulbricht’s Samsung Z700 laptop with a street-level tactic: two agents distracted him while a third grabbed the open laptop out of his hands as Ulbricht was working. The kingpin had been caught red-handed, tapping commands to his Silk Road subordinates up until the moment he was cuffed.\n\nForce had been treating Ulbricht like his personal Bitcoin ATM for several months by this point, attempting to extort DPR one day and wrangling Bitcoin bribes for fake information the next. Now, Force didn’t want to be holding those bitcoins anymore. He opened an account with Bitstamp, a Slovenia-based Bitcoin exchange where he thought he could turn coins into cash quickly and quietly.\n\nBut when Force opened Bitstamp account #557042 on October 12, 2013, it sealed his fate. He had tricked Ulbricht into paying him more than 1,200 bitcoins (a cache worth more than $700,000 today). Trying to launder those ill-gotten gains through Bitstamp was about as poor a choice as Force could make—though the agent couldn’t have known this at the time.\n\nThe investigation of Force ultimately led to a second agent, Shaun Bridges, who worked on the same Baltimore task force and ran an even more lucrative scheme. Incredibly, the two agents were stealing in parallel—friendly co-workers, both tasked to the same case, each apparently unaware of the other’s scheme. One person who helped with the government\'s case believes there is even more corruption inside the Baltimore task force the two agents worked on. (Neither Bridges nor Force responded to Ars\' interview requests for this story.)\n\nThis is the story of how they were caught.\n\nSuspicion\n\nForce opened his account at Bitstamp as ""Eladio Guzman Fuentes,"" an undercover identity that he used in his work as a DEA agent. With a Maryland driver’s license, proof of residence, and Social Security card all connected to Mr. Fuentes, Force thought he’d be in the clear.\n\nHe wasn’t. The documents ended up in the hands of Bitstamp’s general counsel, George Frost, a journalist-turned-attorney who handles legal matters for the Bitcoin startup out of his quiet backyard office in Berkeley, California. Frost looked at the identity documents sent by ""Fuentes,"" and they didn’t check out.\n\n""I can’t tell you exactly how, but we knew they were sophisticated forgeries,"" Frost said in an interview with Ars. Further Reading Sunk: How Ross Ulbricht ended up in prison for life\n\nFrost confronted Force, who quickly fessed up. He showed Bitstamp his real ID, a Baltimore water bill, and his badge.\n\n""I am a Special Agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration and learned about Bitcoin through my investigation of SILK ROAD,"" Force wrote to Bitstamp in an e-mail that Frost provided to Ars. ""I have attached a copy of my resume and a scanned copy of my badge and credentials.""\n\nWith that, Frost let him set up an account, but it still didn’t sit right. Even if the guy was law enforcement, Frost wasn’t sure he wanted him around. The just-founded startup didn’t need the headaches of being a launching platform for DEA undercover operations. In the meantime, Force made a couple of large transactions that November, transferring $34,000 and then $96,000 worth of bitcoin into a bank account.\n\nBitstamp allowed the withdrawals, but Frost continued to be suspicious. DEA credentials or not, Force’s behavior was weird. Frost contacted FinCEN, a bureau of the Treasury Department that collects financial data to uncover possible crimes. The contact at FinCEN was Shaun Bridges, a Secret Service agent whom Frost had worked with previously. (The Secret Service has been part of the Department of Homeland Security since 2003, but was previously under Treasury.)\n\n""[Bridges] was a smart guy and seemed very conscientious,"" Frost recalled.\n\nBridges told Frost he would refer the case to the Department of Justice’s Public Integrity Section—the division that deals with public corruption—but nothing seemed to happen after that.\n\nMeanwhile, Force kept moving his assets out of Bitcoin. In December 2013, he paid off his mortgage in full, which had about $130,000 outstanding.\n\nIn April 2014, six months after the Ulbricht arrest, Force made another big withdrawal. This time, he retrieved about $80,000. Bitstamp employees went back and looked at Force\'s IP addresses—they were all connected to Tor, an anonymizing network for Web browsers to surf the Internet seemingly undetected.\n\n""Sometimes there’s a good reason for using Tor, but it’s a big red flag for us,"" said Frost. (In fact, Bitstamp no longer allows Tor connections.)\n\nForce said he used Tor for privacy, and ""he didn’t particularly want the NSA looking over his shoulder,"" Frost said. It looked fishy, but the withdrawal was allowed.\n\nOn April 28, 2014, Force tried a fourth withdrawal. It was his biggest yet, trying to move more than $200,000 in bitcoins. This time, Frost decided to freeze the account until he could get better answers. He had already contacted federal authorities about this agent\'s behavior, but nothing seemed to be happening.\n\nFurther Reading Disgraced DEA agent from Silk Road case sent weird messages to Mt. Gox CEO On May 1, the attorney tried another route. Frost had a previously scheduled a meeting with someone whose eyes wouldn’t roll back when he mentioned Bitcoin. Kathryn Haun, an assistant United States attorney in San Francisco, was DOJ’s first digital currency coordinator. Also at the meeting was Tigran Gambaryan, then a 28-year-old special agent with the Internal Revenue Service in nearby Oakland.\n\nAfter the meeting, Frost was blunt about his suspicions of Force. ""I\'m an old reporter and I really smell a rat here,"" he recalled himself saying.\n\nHaun asked what was up. It had been a long meeting.\n\n""For one thing, he\'s using his undercover name and undercover credentials,"" Frost explained.\n\nThat was a bit weird. But it was most likely a sign of sloppy undercover work, not criminality. And assigning agents to investigate other agents wasn’t a decision to be made lightly. To Haun, it seemed thin, and she said as much. Still, she told Frost to send on what he had.\n\nGambaryan was interested, too. The Oakland-based agent was deeply interested in tech in general and Bitcoin in particular. He’d relished the stories of his colleagues who’d worked on the Silk Road case, including fellow IRS special agent Gary Alford, who famously was the first to identify Ulbricht through a little Google-fu.\n\nGambaryan also knew about tension between Silk Road investigative teams in Baltimore and New York, but Frost’s sudden aside after the meeting raised the prospect that something more sinister than agency rivalry was going on. It was a distant possibility, but still—why, Gambaryan thought, was anyone involved in the Silk Road case trying to cash out large quantities of Bitcoin?\n\nHaun and Gambaryan were on the fence about the value of investigating this at all. But the very next day, Force did something that made an investigation all but inevitable.\n\n""Could you please delete my transaction history to date?"" Force asked in an e-mail to Bitstamp’s customer service. ""It is cumbersome to go through records back to November 2013 for my accountant.""\n\nThe request put Frost on high alert. He already suspected this DEA agent had somehow gone rogue, and now it looked like he was trying to destroy evidence. He called Bitstamp\'s Slovenian service team and told them not to delete anything, then he called Haun. She opened an investigation the same day, still unsure if it would amount to much.', 'Bill Bardhydt has been trying to solve the problem of mobile money transfers for over a decade and he may have finally found the proper solution in the form of Abra. Even before the development of the famed M-Pesa platform in Kenya, Bardhydt was fascinated with the idea of allowing anyone with a mobile number to send money to any other mobile number in the world.\n\nAt American Banker’s recent “Blockchains + Digital Currencies” event, Bardhydt explained why Bitcoin has been the missing piece of the puzzle in his quest for the Whatsapp of money transfers.\n\nEliminating the Middlemen\n\nBitcoin is well known for its ability to remove third parties from online payments; or at least replace them with a decentralized group of miners who are unable to seize funds. This is the key aspect of Bitcoin that is vital to the success of Abra.\n\n“I basically decided that if there was any way that you could solve the problem of moving funds between any two phone numbers in the world at global scale, you basically need to eliminate all middlemen from the transaction,” Bardhydt told American Banker Editor-in-Chief Marc Hochstein at the recent blockchain conference. “I realized what I wanted was a model that allowed two people to share a digital asset between them with no middlemen. That’s really hard; especially if the digital asset is supposed to be dollars on one end and pesos or euros on the other end.”\n\nCreating Synthetic Currencies\n\nAlthough Bitcoin enables payments with no middlemen, the key issue with that system in its current form is the volatility associated with the underlying bitcoin asset. The general public doesn’t want to track the price of bitcoin when they’re sending money on their phones. Bardhydt says he has come up with a solution to this problem:\n\n“I basically invented this idea of a digital dollar: what we call at Abra, synthetic currency. A synthetic currency is basically the digital equivalent of hedged gold. If I owe you $100, in theory I could hand you $100 worth of gold [based on the spot price of gold at that moment]. But, of course, if you couldn’t sell the gold immediately, you’re taking volatility risk on the price of gold. I could hand you some type of [contract for difference (CFD)] or put option on the gold that would more or less eliminate the downside risk to you. A CFD would eliminate the risk in both directions . . . We could more or less agree that I was handing you $100, even though no paper money was changing hands.”\n\nAccording to Bardhydt, Abra has figured out how to complete the CFD-denominated trade described above on a smartphone without requiring the user to understand how any of it works. Each phone has a private key attached to some bitcoins in a smart contract hedged to the value of any currency supported by Abra.\n\nIn the past, Abra has indicated that their smart contracts will operate in a decentralized manner on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Bardhydt said the company will reveal how the system works at a technical level in a series of blog posts.\n\nThe counterparties who take the long position on these CFD contracts will essentially be able to earn interest on their bitcoin holdings without any counterparty risk. “They’re guaranteed to get the same principle back at the end of the trade,” said Bardhydt.\n\nReal P2P Payments\n\nUsing this system of synthetic currency, Bardhydt believes he has finally created a system for real P2P payments denominated in US dollars. The Abra app can interact directly with the Bitcoin blockchain, which means there is no definable middleman in the money transfers. “Because the underlying asset can be fixed in fiat, I don’t have to expose any of the underpinnings of [the Bitcoin blockchain] to consumers,” explained Bardhydt.\n\nAbra is not a custodian of funds, which lowers the possible regulatory requirements that could weigh down their progress. Abra does not have the ability to reverse a transaction or seize a user’s funds, even if they’re subpoenaed by a court. “The private key is on the phone,” said Bardhydt.\n\nGetting Money On and Off the Phone\n\nAlthough Abra allows anyone with a phone number to send money to any other phone number in the world, there is still the issue of getting money onto the app in the first place. Customers who have bank accounts will be able to add funds via ACH, SEPA, credit cards and other traditional payment options. Those who do not have bank accounts will need to use cash.\n\nRetail tellers and individual tellers will be allowed to sell digital cash on the Abra app for physical cash from other Abra users. This aspect of the app is sort of like Uber for money transfers (think Western Union).\n\nThe entire fireside chat between Marc Hochstein and Bill Bardhydt is available as a recent episode of American Banker’s podcast.']"
08/18/2016,"['It seemed bitcoin exchange Bitfinex was doing all the right things. In the end, that didn\'t stop hackers from stealing $65 million.\n\nThe latest in a long list of attacks on the digital currency since its birth in 2009 has been particularly vexing for the bitcoin community. Not only was Bitfinex the largest exchange for U.S. dollar transactions, but the hack highlights that the industry hasn\'t figured out critical security, despite years of learning from mistakes and making improvements to its infrastructure.\n\nEven as the incident has triggered calls for audits in certain parts of the industry, experts don\'t anticipate the investigations will unearth new ways of radically strengthening protection. What\'s more telling, they say, is that the community\'s willingness to vilify targets while shrugging off the need for industry-wide solutions is a sign it\'s doomed to happen again.\n\n""There is a long tradition of blaming the victim in the bitcoin community,"" said Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell University computer science professor who researches the currency. ""But when you have a six-year long history of near-continuous key theft, at some point, we have to stop shirking off the responsibility.""\n\nThe fallout has been widespread. Bitfinex imposed a levy on customers to cover the lost $65 million, taking 36 percent of everyone\'s assets whether they had been hit by the hackers or not. The price of bitcoin also plunged on news of the hack, slashing the value of the digital currency well beyond Bitfinex. Collectively, investors have lost about $1.2 billion since the attack, according data from Coindesk.\n\nThat\'s not to say bitcoin security hasn\'t come far, through the efforts of thousands who work and volunteer to improve the digital currency. Since Mt. Gox -- at one time the world\'s largest exchange -- was hacked for $450 million in early 2014, most venues have adopted tough security measures, including segregated client accounts, external audits of systems and two-factor authentication for securing logins.\n\nAnother step forward has been multi-signature security, which essentially splits the private keys attached to every bitcoin into several copies and hides them in multiple locations. The technology requires a sign-off from a majority of the copies (for example, two out of three) before the bitcoin can be moved again. That forces hackers to breach multiple systems before they can get access to funds.\n\nBitfinex made use of the technology and, as suggested by security experts, stored copies offline and with a third party, its security partner BitGo Inc. When it was implemented in June 2015, confidence was so high that BitGo\'s chief executive officer boasted the system made ""breaches such as those of Mt. Gox impossible."" Bitfinex hasn\'t disclosed details of how hackers managed to compromise that system, saying the investigation is still pending. It did suspend its use of BitGo\'s technology and said hackers had increased withdrawal limits without BitGo realizing it. BitGo has said its software functioned properly and denied its systems were breached.\n\n""Securing tiny electronic files from leaking - keys - pushes the bounds of known computer science,"" Jeff Garzik, one of Bitcoin\'s earliest developers and founder of blockchain startup Bloq Inc., wrote in an e-mail. ""Multi-sig raises that bar considerably, but nothing is perfect.""\n\nAfter a hack thought \'impossible\' just a year ago, Bitcoin proponents are scrambling for solutions. Some argue that existing technology is strong enough to keep out hackers, but implementation has to be better. Individuals, for example, can protect themselves by storing bitcoin in individual wallets rather than at exchanges, which remain targets for attack.\n\n""When users choose to store their bitcoin in a custodial wallet or exchange, they are giving the provider control over their bitcoins,"" said Peter Smith, chief executive officer of Blockchain, which provides bitcoin wallets to individuals. ""As a result, customers are not only subjected to the possibility that they will lose their funds via cybertheft but also that the provider can impose a tax to cover the loss of other clients, as Bitfinex is doing here.""\n\nA more radical solution is to use technology to punish thieves. This summer, hackers siphoned off about $60 million of ethereum, the world\'s second most-popular digital currency behind bitcoin. The community reacted by adopting a so-called hard fork, which effectively migrated users to a new version of ethereum in which the theft never occured. The decision triggered a rebellion from a significant chunk of the community, who argued that nullifying the theft was a violation of ethereum\'s free market ethos.\n\nGiven such extreme steps, some say the time has come for the Bitcoin community to consider a form of regulation, either self-imposed or with the assistance of governments. The key, they say, will be educating regulators so that they don\'t slow down innovation in the name of protecting consumers. Some, including BitGo, have begun work with auditors like Deloitte LLP to standardize security requirements for the industry, although how and who would enforce the guidelines is unclear.\n\n""Even Bitcoin enthusiasts are slowly realizing that regulation is necessary,"" said Trond Undheim, a former senior lecturer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\'s Sloan School of Management. ""That\'s the only way it will survive. That\'s also the key to its wider adoption.""\n\nInvestors want solutions. Kay Van-Petersen, a strategist at Saxo Capital Markets, avoided Bitfinex but still saw a tenth of his Bitcoin investment wiped out as prices dropped after the attack. ""Every time an exchange gets hacked, it just looks bad on everybody,"" he said.\n\nWith additional reporting by Olga Kharif', 'Another day, another crazy bitcoin story.\n\nThis time: Users are being warned that an upcoming release of digital currency could be targeted by ""state-sponsored hackers.""\n\nPopular bitcoin information site Bitcoin.org has been updated with a message urging users to take care when updating their software: ""Bitcoin.org has reason to suspect that the binaries for the upcoming Bitcoin Core release will likely be targeted by state sponsored attackers. As a website, Bitcoin.org does not have the necessary technical resources to guarantee that we can defend ourselves from attackers of this calibre. We ask the Bitcoin community, and in particular the Chinese Bitcoin community to be extra vigilant when downloading binaries from our website.""\n\nBitcoin is open-source, meaning that anyone can download the code that powers the digital currency themselves and compile it into software. But ordinary users without the time (or technical know-how) can just download binaries — pre-compiled versions of the software that do not require any special knowledge to run.\n\nThe contributor to Bitcoin.org is worried that these binaries might be targeted: ""If an attacker could intercept and secretly modify the files, it could compromise users who unwittingly install them. The attacker could potentially steal the victims\' bitcoins, or use their machine in a ""51% attack,"" which attempts to take control of the majority of the bitcoin network.\n\nThere is no word on the evidence behind the Bitcoin.org contributor\'s suspicions, nor do we know which country is behind the supposed forthcoming attack — or even what its end goal is.\n\n""In such a situation, not being careful before you download binaries could cause you to lose all your coins,"" the site says. ""This malicious software might also cause your computer to participate in attacks against the Bitcoin network. We believe Chinese services such as pools and exchanges are most at risk here due to the origin of the attackers.""\n\nComplicating matters, it sounds like the person who updated the site did it by themselves. Eric Lombrozo, a contributor to Bitcoin Core, told The Register: ""The maintainer of the bitcoin.org site (which is unaffiliated with the Bitcoin Core project itself) posted an advisory of an apparent threat he\'s been informed about – without consulting anyone else.""\n\nLombrozo went on: ""There\'s absolutely nothing in the Bitcoin Core binaries, as built by the Bitcoin Core team, that has been targeted by state sponsored attackers that we know of at this point. Perhaps certain sites where people download the binaries could end up getting compromised, but let\'s not unnecessarily spread paranoia about the Bitcoin Core binaries themselves.""\n\nIn short: There\'s an ominous warning of an impending government hack attack, but with no evidence to substantiate it (yet), and others in the community are expressing skepticism.\n\nFor bitcoin, with its outrageous history of hacks, paranoia, and confusion, this is all par for the course.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'Startups powered by Bitcoin and Blockchain technology raised $290 million during the first six months of this year, resembling the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.\n\nAccording to a report by Juniper Research, venture capital investment raised by companies employing either Blockchain technology, or Bitcoin directly, amounted to more than a quarter of a billion dollars.\n\nAbout a third of this was raised by three companies: Circle, a social payment provider, which raised $60 million; Distributed Asset Holdings, a distributed ledger solutions provider, which raised $50 million; and, of course, Blockstream, the sidechain developer, which raised $55 million.\n\nLee Gibson Grant of the Drachmae Travel Club sees investments flowing into Blockchain startups as more and more people become aware of the technology’s capabilities.\n\nHe says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“The Blockchain space is typical of new technology coming onto the market. This early stage sees many startups and experiments, which will provide proof that the technology is applicable in specific, practical use cases. Once identified, there will be consolidation into leaders within those areas at first, and progressively more capital will flow into those entities. Over time the investments will be billions of dollars, and will create new businesses and many new employment opportunities.”\n\nWill the Blockchain investment bubble burst?\n\nMarc De Mesel, early investor behind Bitcoin and NXT, as well as emergency response app Cell 411, believes that the Blockchain investment bubble will pop in a few years.\n\nHe explains to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Many new technologies which change society fundamentally go through a big bubble where everybody wants a piece of it and mass hysteria leads to overvaluation. This was true for railways (1840s), radio stations, telephone & electricity companies, motion pictures, auto manufacturers, airlines (1920s) as well as more recently computer, internet & mobile phone companies. Cryptocurrencies are part of this wave of digitization which makes communication and transactions much cheaper, faster and richer. Suddenly, money becomes of much higher quality, available for everyone in all kind of flavors. I think crypto will have a big bubble just like dotcoms had, I estimate around 2020. Fortunes will be made by a few while the masses, as always, will lose their shirt. Still, just like dotcoms, digital coins will be here to stay and become part of everyday life.”\n\nChristopher David, CEO of ride-sharing startup Arcade City, sees a similar bubble in Blockchain tech, but sees long-term viability in the industry.\n\n“Blockchain tech will go through the hype cycle the same as any emerging technology. But the trajectory is upwards and the curve should only get steeper. Compare it to the internet revolution, which liberated flows of data. Blockchain tech will liberate flows of value, disrupting existing power structures and affecting everyone. Decentralization is the future, and blockchain is the tech to make it happen. Huge impact, huge opportunity. Investment in the space should rise year after year with no end in sight.”\n\nA warning against combining smart contracts and blockchains\n\nThe Juniper report does caution against some potential pitfalls behind Blockchain technology. According to the research, when smart contracts are not properly tested through and through for potential bugs or vulnerabilities, and are then placed on a Blockchain, all weaknesses are available for anyone to see and publicly exploit.\n\nThis is similar to what happened with the DAO, where almost $80 million in Ethereum was stolen, prompting the community to hard fork the currency and give rise to Ethereum Classic.\n\nAs research author Dr. Windsor Holden explains, the promise of Blockchain technology should not be seized in haste without fully testing all the variables involved:\n\n“While Blockchain technology offers the potential for increased speed, transparency and security across an array of verticals, there has to be rigorous and robust road testing in each unique use case before any decision is taken.”\n\nRegardless, critics are once again declaring Bitcoin dead\n\nDespite the aforementioned success this year, critics have taken to their favorite pastime of declaring cryptocurrency’s digital gold to be a thing of the past. This has taken place year after year, practically since Bitcoin’s inception. In fact, 99 Bitcoins has created an ongoing Bitcoin obituary list. This list logs all the articles which have declared Bitcoin to be over, including the price in USD at the time of writing, so that we all might reflect on how many times Bitcoin has proved the naysayers wrong.', 'Rakuten has confirmed that it has acquired the assets of Bitnet, a bitcoin wallet startup it invested in, which will be used to create a ‘blockchain lab’ for the Japanese retail giant.\n\nThe transaction is undisclosed but it follows a Wall Street Journal report in July which speculated that a deal was in the works. Rakuten took part in a $14.5 million investment round for Bitnet nearly two years ago, which was led by Highland Capital Partners.\n\nRakuten integrated Belfast-based Bitnet’s payment option into some of its online commerce sites last summer. Bitnet was supposed to rival bitcoin payment heavyweights Coinbase and Bitpay, but after a spate of executives left and the startup reportedly laid off half of its staff to cut costs, it struggled to grow its business. That led to this strategic asset-stripping move from Rakuten.\n\nThe Japanese e-commerce giant is taking Bitnet’s IP and “assets” and two of the startup’s key personnel to create a Belfast-located research facility to explore the potential of the blockchain. That makes a lot of sense given Rakuten’s empire of e-commerce websites and banking services in Japan and elsewhere in the world.\n\nBitnet CTO Stephen McNamara and former VP of Engineering Fergal Down have come on board to helm the lab which “will be a dedicated research and development organization within Rakuten, focused on blockchain technology and its potential applications in the fintech and e-commerce sectors,” the company said.\n\n“Drawing on the significant IP assets and deep engineering expertise of the Bitnet team and combining that with Rakuten’s leadership in fintech and support of innovative solutions, the new Rakuten Blockchain Lab will be our first step toward unlocking blockchain’s potential to revolutionize the way that financial and e-commerce transactions are conducted,” Yasufumi Hirai, who leads Rakuten’s technology division, added via a prepared statement.', 'Japanese e-commerce firm Rakuten is opening a blockchain development lab in the UK, a move that follows its acquisition of former employees at bitcoin payments startup Bitnet.\n\nFormer Bitnet employees Stephen McNamara and Fergal Downey will spearhead the Belfast-based operation, which Rakuten said today will be focused on blockchain technology and FinTech more broadly.\n\nThe move comes more than a year after the e-retailer began accepting bitcoin, becoming one of the more noteworthy firms in the Asia-Pacific region to explore adopting the digital currency as a payment method.\n\nIt was around this time that Rakuten first moved to invest in Bitnet, with word emerging last month that acquisition talks had begun between the two camps, according to The Wall Street Journal. Bitnet raised $14.5m in 2014 to compete in the then-growing market for digital currency payments processing.\n\nWith the news, Ratuken joins a growing number of established companies to found laboratories dedicated wholly or in part to blockchain research.

More time is needed and these conversations must continue in order for California to be at the forefront of this effort.\n\nState lawmakers were poised to quickly jam through an amended version of a digital currency licensing bill\xad with new provisions that were even worse than last year’s version.\n\nAs in the previous version, the bill required a “digital currency business” to get approval from the state before operating in California and also comply with regulations similar to those applicable to banks and money transmitters. The amended bill, however, was so carelessly drafted that it would have forced Bitcoin miners, video game makers, and even digital currency users to register with a state agency and be subject to the new regulations.\n\nWorse, the bill failed to accomplish its intent—protecting consumers—because it would have limited the number of digital currency options available to Californians.\n\nEFF is grateful that Assemblymember Dababneh recognized there were problems with the legislation and put the brakes on sending it through the legislature as its session winds down.\n\nThat said, the bill demonstrates that there are still too many technical and policy gaps in the current thinking about digital currencies and the need for regulation.\n\nEFF continues to believe that before lawmakers anywhere consider legislation regulating digital currencies, they need to better understand the technology at issue as well as demonstrating how the legislation actually benefits consumers. The California bill unfortunately failed in both respects.\n\nA.B. 1326 Would Have Hurt Consumers\n\nFirst, as EFF’s opposition letter to A.B. 1326 stated, the bill’s goal to protect consumers would have ironically been frustrated by the legislation, as it would have restricted access to currencies that benefit consumers in ways that non-digital currencies do not.\n\nMany digital currencies allow individuals to directly transact with one another even when they do not know or trust each other. These currencies have significant benefits to consumers as they eliminate the third parties needed in non-digital transactions that can often be the sources of fraud or other consumer harm.\n\nFurther, intermediaries in traditional currency transactions, such as payment processers, are often the targets of financial censorship, which ultimately inhibits people’s ability to support controversial causes or organizations.\n\nBecause the bill would have allowed California’s Department of Business Oversight to determine which digital currency businesses operated in California, the government would have been deciding which currencies and businesses could be used, rather than consumers. This would have significantly limited Californians’ digital currency options, to their detriment.\n\nA.B. 1326’s Vague Terms Would Have Required Consumers to Register\n\nThe bill was also written in a manner that failed to grasp how digital currencies work, leading to broad definitions of “digital currency business” that would have regulated not just businesses transacting on behalf of digital currency users, but the users themselves.\n\nThere were many vague definitions in the bill. Take for example, a provision requiring anyone who transmits digital currencies to another person to register and comply with its complex regulations.\n\nDigital currency users often directly transmit digital currency value to others without any intermediary, meaning those users would have been subject to the regulations even though they are merely using a digital currency. Additionally, despite the bill purporting to have an exemption for parties such as Bitcoin miners, they would also have to register because in appending transactions to the Blockchain, they could be viewed as transmitting digital currency.\n\nThe bill also would have required video game makers who offer in-game digital currency or goods to register, as the exemption for such activity is limited to items or currency that have no value outside of the game. The reality is that many items and currencies within games often have independent markets in which players buy, sell, or exchange items, regardless of whether a game maker allows for those transactions. Those game makers, however, would have to obtain a license under the bill even though they often do not control the outside markets. The bill would have also created roadblocks for video game companies who offer in-game currency that can be used to buy real world items, such as T-shirts or stickers.\n\nAdditionally, the bill contained no exemption for start-ups or smaller companies innovating digital currencies, giving established currencies such as Bitcoin and its more sophisticated industry a leg up over competition.\n\nThe many problems with the bill would ultimately have been bad for the state, as it would have pushed innovation elsewhere and chilled a young and quickly evolving industry.\n\nEFF recognizes that there are risks for consumers using digital currencies and appreciates lawmakers interested in addressing them. We think any legislative response, however, should be based on a better understanding of the state of digital currencies and narrowly focused on the situations that pose risks for consumers. Such an approach would preserve space for innovation in the industry while still protecting users.', 'Blockchain has become a movement in its own right, the technology that forms the underlying platform for Bitcoin and other digital currencies is being adapted to all kinds of applications today. From insurance documents to identity verification, stock tracking to the veracity of artwork, it seems blockchain has an application everywhere. Now Australian company Power ledger is aiming to revolutionize the energy market by using blockchain to create a market where excess solar energy can be sold directly to consumers. The promise is that of cheaper energy for consumers, and better prices for suppliers, with tests beginning later this month.\n\nOne of the major products of the rise of the digital currency industry since the release of Bitcoin in 2009 has been the adaptability of the underlying blockchain technology that drives it. From major financial institutions to clothing companies, it seems like almost every industry and market sector has an application that can make use of blockchain technology. Of course, there are ideas to use blockchain that never get beyond an idea, but one that has real potential has come from Australian company Power ledger, and is focussed on the solar energy market.\n\nThe system, that will start its initial small scale trial a t the end of this month, aims to offer a more efficient and easy to use way of buying, selling or even exchanging the excess solar power that homeowners generate through their solar panels. The current system allows a low feed tariff to be reclaimed as the excess solar energy is sold to the grid, but this proposed system is hoped to prove more efficient and offer a better deal for both buyers and sellers.\n\nThe system to be tested is designed to allow both producers and consumers to trade energy directly, allowing less overheads and thus lower prices for buyers, while also maximizing the output of producers, as noted by Power Ledger founder Jemma Green, who said:\n\n“For many consumers, the decision to put solar panels on their roofs wasn’t just about saving money or saving the environment; it was an investment decision. The ability to now sell their excess energy to other customers represents the return on their investment.”\n\nThe reduced transaction overheads and direct transactions mean that those with solar panels effectively become their own energy wholesaler, and consumers can benefit from the reduced, wholesale level prices, creating a benefit to all parties involved.\n\nThe initial trial will be restricted to a small number of homes, but it is hoped that wider scale rollout will follow in due course afterwards. The adaptability of blockchain is unquestionable now, and the many advantages of the technology are finding ways to improve vastly disparate markets, it may not have been the way many imagined the cryptocurrency industry would expand, but it is without question effective.', 'KeepKey and ShapeShift recently announced a partnership to create the first fully trustless and highly secure process for trading cryptocurrencies. According to KeepKey, beta testing will begin next week.\n\n- ShapeShift\n\nFormed in mid-2014, ShapeShift was founded by early bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees. The company is located in Switzerland’s “Cryptovalley Zug,” a small suburb of Zurich that is home to a number of blockchain companies. The company’s platform provides instant cryptocurrency conversion between bitcoin and several altcoins.\n\nThe service has proven to be a fast and efficient way to convert between cryptocurrencies, mainly because it requires no identification of any kind, which also makes it attractive to privacy advocates. ShapeShift excludes fiat trading on the exchange, bypassing currency laws, banking relationships, and government censorship.\n\nThe platform\'s dominance in the field has only recently been tested by decentralized exchanges such as BitSquare and the OmniDEX. These decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges are software programs that allow for trading cryptocurrencies with tokens that represent fiat money, such as Tether\'s USDT.\n\n- KeepKey\n\nKeepKey is located in Seattle, not far from Microsoft’s Redmond world headquarters. Founder and CEO Darin Stanchfield, and his team, announced the launch of their hardware wallet for bitcoin, in July 2015. What made it different from the start was a unusually large and readable screen coupled with a hardened body that could take more of a pounding.\n\nThe company has been fighting for dominance in the hardware wallet race ever since. The device cost more than twice as much as competitors Trezor and Ledger, US$239 shortly after launch.\n\nAlthough smaller, Both Trezor and Ledger wallets integrated many more wallet services and websites than KeepKey did, making the most expensive wallet appear the least useful.\n\nIn May of this year, bitcoin wallet MultiBit announced that KeepKey was buying their company and integrating their wallet. Around the same time, the price of a KeepKey plummeted to $99, making it the same price as its primary competitor, the Trezor hardware wallet.\n\nThe price of a KeepKey has since dropped even further, to $89, perhaps to compete with the new, smaller Ledger Nano S wallet. The new device is keychain-sized, and has similar functionality to both the KeepKey and Trezor.\n\n- KeepKey\n\nAt the end of July, mobile wallet Mycelium added support for KeepKey, and KeepKey added support for the ever-popular Electrum client as well. Between the new integrations and the new lower price, KeepKey has been rapidly catching up to competitors.\n\nPairing a secure device like the KeepKey to the trustless exchange ShapeShift is particularly unique because there has never before been a way to trade currencies online in a way that a skilled hacker had no way to intercept.\n\nPasswords, private keys, and any other data-based authentication allowing people to authenticate who they are online were always at some small risk of being stolen or spoofed.\n\nShapeShift doesn’t need to authenticate any users, and the concealing nature of KeepKey doesn’t put the private key onto your computer. All key signing to send funds is done on the device itself, so there is no point at all where a private key is online to be stolen. Simply put, this configuration leaves nothing for a hacker to steal.\n\n- KeepKey\n\nAccording to ShapeShift, the integration is the first time users can store and trade digital assets without ever having to expose their private keys to the internet. “This is a HUGE step forward in security for traders,” the exchange wrote.\n\nKeepKey was quick to reference the recent BitFinex hack as an example of why the pairing is needed. “A few weeks ago a large crypto currency exchange was hacked, resulting in the loss of a large portion of its customer’s funds,” KeepKey’s blog post said. “Unfortunately this will unlikely be the last time we see an exchange get attacked.”\n\nEver since the hack and resulting ‘socialized losses’ applied to all of the exchange\'s users, the phrase ‘If you don’t control your private keys, you don’t own your bitcoin’ has been constantly repeated across Bitcoin social media outlets, much like it was after the MtGox failure in early 2014. KeepKey, Trezor, and Ledger were all created to secure private keys better than any other type of solution.\n\nFor existing KeepKey owners, an upgrade of KeepKey’s open source firmware will be required to start trading. Cryptocoin traders can then use the device to initiate a trade for currencies listed on the ShapeShift exchange.\n\nKeepKey says that Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin will be supported at launch “with more to soon follow.” There are 39 different cryptocurrencies currently showing on ShapeShift website.\n\n- KeepKey\n\n“By default for all users, this ShapeShift-ability is disabled,” the KeepKey announcement said. With the ShapeShift policy enabled, “KeepKey goes through the extra steps of verifying the exchange request originated from ShapeShift unchanged and that the exchanged currency and refund addresses belong to KeepKey,” their announcement explains. “The details are then presented on device and must manually be confirmed.”\n\nStanchfield revealed the goals for the program in his announcement, added security and convenience to a larger audience. “While digital asset security is KeepKey’s primary goal, we are making life easier for the growing number of consumers buying, selling and storing several types of cryptocurrency,” he explained. “They can swap whatever they like, whenever they like, without the hassle of setting up multiple wallets or addresses or signing up to various exchanges.""', 'A new report released by Greenwich Associates has found that a high percentage of respondents are concerned with blockchain security when it comes to transaction confidentiality.\n\nBlockchain technology is taking the financial institution by storm. As more financial companies continue investing into the technology to bring it to the market it seems hopeful that it could have a major impact in a few years.\n\nHowever, there are significant hurdles in place that need to be tackled first, namely blockchain security.\n\nThe Bitfinex hack earlier this month, which saw hackers steal $70 million worth of users’ bitcoins and the attempted hack of $50 million worth of Ether on the DAO have brought the security of blockchain to the forefront of discussion.\n\nIn the new report from Greenwich Associates, Securing the Blockchain, they found from the 134 market participants questioned, 56 percent said that transaction confidentiality was a significant security concern with blockchain technology. When it came to banks and brokers that number was slightly higher with 63 percent concerned.\n\nSecurity of Private Keys\n\nEven though transaction confidentiality tops the list of concerns for the respondents questioned, the security of private keys is also an issue with 52 percent of respondents citing it as a major concern. Given the recent Bitfinex hack, the issue of private keys is a particularly pertinent topic right now.\n\nWhile the details of the hack are yet to be revealed it seems that the hackers were savvy enough to gain access to the private keys that secured customers’ accounts and subsequently steal their bitcoins.\n\nAccording to Richard Johnson, vice-president of market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates, technology companies developing permissioned blockchains for financial services will need to rethink the multi-sig/cold storage approach that is currently employed by digital currency exchanges.\n\nHe said:\n\nAlthough these solutions can be highly secure, this security comes at the cost of lower efficiency and higher administrative overhead. Indeed, it was shortcuts taken by the Bitfinex exchange that led to the theft and not the technology itself.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '']"
08/19/2016,"['Why would Bitcoin.org say it has any reason to suspect that its website will likely be targeted by state sponsored attackers?\n\nThis is the question that has received varying answers in the last two days. It has raised a worrying concern particularly as not much information has been provided on the topic by the initiator of the warning. The Bitcoin.org contact form doesn’t seem to be functional and the press release has nothing more than the warning to be ‘extra vigilant when downloading the binaries from our website for the upcoming 0.13.0 release.’\n\nAny cause for alarm?\n\nIt seems like a necessary but calculated message that plans not to say much. This could probably be an attempt to curb FUD within the Bitcoin community. However, considering the recent damage the hack on a Chinese exchange has caused on the community, another attack - especially from a government source - is the least Bitcoin enthusiasts would love to hear about right now.\n\nA part of the warning says:\n\n“As a website, Bitcoin.org does not have the necessary technical resources to guarantee that we can defend ourselves from attackers of this calibre. We ask the Bitcoin community, and in particular the Chinese Bitcoin community to be extra vigilant when downloading binaries from our website. We believe Chinese services such as pools and exchanges are most at risk here due to the origin of the attackers.”\n\nBitcoin.org prescribed a way for users to be confident that the binaries they’re running are the same ones created by the Core Developers.\n\nOur source from Bitcoin.org says there is no extra information concerning the warning than that already made public. He explains that the announcement came out of the blue even for him and suggests that users should heed to the advice and check signatures after downloading if they haven’t done it yet.\n\nWhat can actually happen during Bitcoin software update?\n\nWhile there haven’t been any concrete evidence that the attack is imminent, there are suggestions that the warning is just about safety precaution particularly as government agencies may be interested in tracking payments.\n\nTheymos, Reddit /r/Bitcoin moderator, says:\n\n“There\'s no flaw in 0.13.0 itself. The concern is that for the next major release, an attack might be attempted as everyone rushes to upgrade. If the Core devs had to do a non-SegWit 0.12.2 bugfix release, then the warning would apply equally to that.”\n\nA report called it the ""most significant code change"" for Segregated Witness which would be the next step in preparing it to be eventually deployed potentially in version 0.13.1. It says that with the addition of the codenow, Bitcoin Core devs believe SegWit will be smoother and safer when released.\n\nCasting minds back to last year, one of the research questions by RAND Corporation in its National Security Implications of Virtual Currency report is to understand how a government or organization might successfully technologically disrupt a virtual currency deployment by a non-state actor, and the degree of cyber sophistication that would be required.\n\nHowever, a part of its key findings says non-state actors cannot use established virtual currencies to disrupt sovereignty and increase political and/or economic power.', 'The state assemblyman behind efforts to regulate digital currency businesses in California cited the $65m hack of Bitfinex this week as evidence of the need for tighter industry controls.\n\nIn a statement issued following his state\'s decision to temporarily shelve further regulatory deliberations this year, he said that more time was needed to strike a balance between giving virtual currency businesses a firm foundation and ensuring consumers are protected.\n\nAssemblyman Matt Dababneh said in the statement:\n\n""Today, a user of virtual currency has no protection from loss, and businesses that use, transmit or store virtual currency live in an ecosystem of regulatory uncertainty. Potential harm to consumers is not some remote possibility, but has already happened.""\n\nDababneh first proposed the bill last year shortly after becoming chairman of the state’s Banking and Finance Committee, and a revised version was once again introduced this year amid resistance from industry advocates.\n\nIn remarks, Dababneh credited conversations with ""virtual currency experts, consumer organizations"" as a deciding factor in the determination to suspend the proposed legislation until January of next year.\n\nCalifornia’s regulatory effort follows New York\'s implementation of the so-called BitLicense, its controversial industry-specific licensing regime. That law, introduced in 2015, has been blamed for the departure of some digital currency startups from the state.\n\nOverall, Dababneh sought to position the delayed bill as part of his state’s efforts to take a leadership position in the industry.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Unfortunately, the current bill in print does not meet the objectives to create a lasting regulatory framework that protects consumers and allows this industry to thrive in our state.""\n\nImage via TimeWarnerCable\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Photo: Joe Chisholm for Circle Sport-Leavine Family Racing\n\nOne evening in April, Dave Winston stood in a convenience store in suburban Charlotte, N.C., uneasily shoving $20 bills into a slim automated-teller machine unlike any he had ever seen. He was buying bitcoin, a digital currency unknown to him a few hours earlier, before hackers took over his computer.\n\nMr. Winston, crew chief with the Circle Sport-Leavine Family Nascar race team, is among a growing number of victims of a pernicious type of malicious software called ransomware, which has earned millions of dollars for cybercriminals by encrypting computer files and holding them hostage.\n\nRansomware dates to the late 1980s, but attacks spiked this year amid the growing use of bitcoin and improved encryption software. Malicious code turned Mr. Winston’s Excel spreadsheets and Word documents into unreadable gobbledygook, and hackers told him to pay $500 in bitcoin to unscramble them.\n\nMr. Winston doesn’t know how the software infected his computer, but security experts say attacks often start with an email message containing an attachment or a link to a website that quietly installs the software.\n\nOnce considered a consumer problem, ransomware has morphed to target entire networks of computers at hospitals, universities and businesses. That has made it a far more serious and costly threat. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, ransomware attacks have quadrupled this year from a year ago, averaging 4,000 a day. Typical ransomware payments range from $500 to $1,000, according to cyberrisk data firm Cyence Inc., but some hackers have demanded as much as $30,000an attack that crippled a large portion of the hospital’s computer systems.\n\nHollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles paid roughly $17,000 to unlock files in February, following an attack that crippled a large portion of the hospital’s computer systems.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation said ransomware attacks cost victims $209 million in the first three months of the year, including costs, such as lost productivity and staff time to recover files, that is an average of about $333,000 an incident, based on complaints that it has received. The total is up from $24 million for all of 2015, or about $10,000 an infection, the FBI said.\n\nRansomware is deviously simple. Often after tricking the victim into clicking on a malicious link or attachment, the software then encrypts files—often targeting Microsoft Office documents—and displays a message with instructions to recover them. A ransomware maker who calls himself “The Rainmaker” offers a $39 version of his software on hacker forums. A Microsoft spokesman said, “We are committed to helping protect our customers, and Office includes features to help prevent macro-malware infections.”\n\nMany ransomware attacks exploit known bugs in software, and attackers depend on people not installing updates. Criminals find ransomware easier and more profitable than other scams, such as breaking into consumers’ computers and stealing money via online banking, said Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, a researcher with Kaspersky Lab ZAO.\n\nAnother factor is the increasing use and stability of bitcoin, the digital currency. Bitcoin is now the preferred payment method of most ransomware infections because it allows users to send and receive money from anywhere in the world, often anonymously.\n\nOne university chief security officer said he purchased two bitcoin “mining” machines, which generate bitcoin on their own by performing the complex calculations that allow the bitcoin financial network to operate. Since January, he has been using these systems to stockpile bitcoin, just in case he needs to quickly recover a critical computer. He spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid making his employer a ransomware target.\n\nIn the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center hack, cybercriminals broke into a server in late January. After two weeks of reconnaissance, they struck on a Friday night, when the hospital’s tech staff was off, encrypting data on 850 computers and 150 servers and rendering documents unreadable, according to Steve Giles, the hospital’s technology manager.\n\nThe lab and pharmacy were unaffected, but doctors’ orders, patient transfers and payroll systems had to be logged on pen and paper. By 3 a.m. Saturday, the hospital declared a state of emergency.\n\nThe hackers’ warning was stark: Pay $9,000 in bitcoin within seven days or the hospital’s systems would be destroyed. Mr. Giles paid the ransom later on Saturday.\n\nMr. Giles felt he had no choice. “I called the CEO and said, ‘Even if they don’t send us the encryption code, this is a worthwhile bet.’”\n\nThe next day, the hackers demanded another $8,000, a common tactic according to the FBI. After the second payment, Mr. Giles received a series of about 60 letters and numbers needed to unlock the hospital’s files.\n\nSince the Hollywood Presbyterian attack was made public, Mr. Giles has fielded calls from ransomware victims seeking advice. He has heard from a taxi company in Los Angeles, a chemical plant in Arkansas, water districts in Michigan and Nevada. None revealed if they had paid ransoms; some wouldn’t name their employers, to avoid becoming a target.\n\nThe data held hostage on the computer of race team crew chief Mr. Winston amounted to a blueprint for controlling the car in different conditions, including data for adjusting the springs, shocks and driver controls. The attack threatened his team’s ability to participate in a race just days away in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nAs he fed bill after bill into the ATM, Mr. Winston felt he was probably throwing money away. “I felt like it was an extreme long shot,” he said, “but it was a shot that I thought we had to take.”\n\nHis $500 bitcoin investment paid off. His files unlocked, the team finished two laps off the winning pace that Saturday in the Duck Commander 500 at Texas Motor Speedway.\n\n— Nicole Hong contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com\n\nAppeared in the August 20, 2016, print edition as 'Hackers Hold Computers for Ransom.'"", 'Five years ago, bitcoin was an obscure and esoteric online currency, used by few and understood by fewer. Today, after half a decade of sturm, drang, and drama—not to mention multi-million dollar hacks and grandiose proclamations—it is … an obscure and esoteric online currency, used by few and understood by fewer. Despite the breathless prophecies of countless pundits, neither death nor revolution have come to pass.\n\nBut it would be wrong to view these past few years as mere stagnation, as Paul Vigna does in a recent Wall Street Journal piece, arguing that “hacks and the irreversible nature of transactions stand in the way of broader acceptance.” At the end of the day, Vigna asks, “Is [bitcoin] really a better mousetrap?”\n\nDespite the breathless prophecies of countless pundits, neither death nor revolution have come to pass. It’s a reasonable question. Bitcoin’s current system may worry more mainstream banking customers used to a certain level of institutional accountability. But it’s near-sighted to focus solely on the present. As we speak, developers are proposing new, more accessible structures that could, in the near future, create a Bitcoin 2.0 that is both palatable to the mainstream while retaining the original’s innovative spirit.\n\nThe central thesis of bitcoin is that it is trustless and permissionless; anyone can use the bitcoin network to send and receive money without having to verify their identity or seek the approval of a central authority. The flip side of this virtual coin is that there is no authority to appeal to when something goes wrong.\n\nIf you keep your bitcoin in a personal (virtual) wallet, and lose the security codes you need to access it— or if you outsource that wallet to a service like the recently-hacked Bitfinex, and they lose them—then you have no real recourse. Similarly, if you send bitcoin to a vendor and do not receive the promised goods, there is no way to reverse the transaction. That prospect of irreversible loss is not appealing to people accustomed to credit-card charges that can be disputed and reversed. But this state of affairs is essential to bitcoin’s extraordinary ability to move real value anywhere on the internet, in a matter of minutes, without having to trust any third party.\n\nThe central thesis of bitcoin is that it is permissionless. The flip side is there is no authority to appeal to when something goes wrong. Sound like a Catch-22? Not so fast. The other extraordinary thing about bitcoin, and its successor cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, is that every transaction is not merely a ledger entry. Each transaction is actually a software program, known as a “smart contract,” which must run successfully for the transaction to complete.\n\nHistorically, most smart contracts have been pretty dumb. But ongoing expansions to bitcoin’s core protocol have opened up the prospect of whole new categories of payment networks, built atop bitcoin in the same way that modern internet applications are built upon machine-to-machine TCP/IP protocols.\n\nThese new Bitcoin 2.0 proposals are designed to be more practical, accessible, and usable than bitcoin itself, while retaining the aspects that make it extraordinary. The two proposals which seem closest to coming into being are sidechains and the Lighting Network.\n\nSidechains would allow people to seamlessly exchange their bitcoins into different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is famously built atop a distributed data structure known as the blockchain. Historically, every cryptocurrency has had its own blockchain. The remarkable thing about sidechains is that they would allow value to move automatically, and seamlessly, between different blockchains, each with its own rules. Think of sidechains as the ability to move your money from a bank with no rules and no insurance to a bank with lots of rules and lots of insurance—and back—whenever you want, at the push of a button. These new Bitcoin 2.0 proposals are designed to be more practical, accessible, and usable than bitcoin itself.\n\nThis would mean that, if you wanted reversible transactions, you could move your bitcoin to a sidechain in which all transactions take a week to process and can be revoked by a trusted central authority during that time. Alternatively, you could move your bitcoins to a blockchain that is faster than the current bitcoin network, which is limited to seven transactions per second and takes up to an hour to confirm transactions. Some relatively minor changes to the core Bitcoin protocol are still required to to support the crypto magic that makes sidechains possible, but we can reasonably expect those to be implemented in the next year or two.\n\nThe Lightning Network, meanwhile, is a proposal for a whole new kind of payment network built atop the bitcoin blockchain–one that offers instant payments, micropayments, and massive scalability.\n\nIt’s easy to mock cryptocurrency drama. But behind the scenes, a great deal of interesting work has already been done. Imagine two banks with customers who frequently transfer money to one another. Instead of actually performing thousands of transfers a day, they each exchange instant IOUs as they happen, and then, each night, perform a single transfer to settle the net balance.\n\nSimilarly, Lightning would be a decentralized network of bitcoin “payment channels.” These channels are as mathematically secure as bitcoin itself, but only occasionally need to be formally settled on the bitcoin blockchain. If you wanted, you could establish a single payment channel with a trusted bank—with escrow powers, again—and perform all your transactions through it. But you would also still retain the ability to make payments through other channels, or on the “old-fashioned” bitcoin blockchain, in its traditionally trustless and permissionless way. Lightning is already under active development by several different startups.\n\nGiven the many colorful headlines regarding exchange hacks, claims and counterclaims regarding the identity of bitcoin’s mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto, and the recent rise and (partial) fall of Ethereum, confusion over bitcoin’s future is understandable, even warranted. It’s easy to mock cryptocurrency drama; I do it myself, frequently. But don’t let that blind you. Behind the scenes, a great deal of difficult and interesting work has already been done. The progress of “Bitcoin 2.0” is remarkable, and so is its potential.\n\nFollow Jon on Twitter at @rezendi.

He and co-founders – fellow Dane Jan Moller (chief technology officer) and Briton Jonathan Levin (chief revenue officer) – set about building the tool, completing the work in just a few months.\n\nAnti-money laundering Although the tool was mainly aimed at providing anti-money-laundering systems for companies active in the blockchain and bitcoin space and financial institutions that provide banking services to the blockchain industry, the tool’s anti-cyber crime application soon become clear. Chainalysis began working with police in San Franciso on several investigations involving bitcoins, rapidly making wider contacts with law enforcement organisations in the US and elsewhere. As a result, law enforcement now accounts for a significant portion of Chainalysis’ customer base. The company has since been involved in several high-profile cases, including investigations into the disappearance of £250m worth of bitcoins after the collapse of bitcoin exchange MtGox in 2014. Chainalysis software enables law enforcement agencies to follow traces of bitcoin to find the services that cyber criminals are using to convert bitcoin into cash or other digital currencies.\n\nCriminals’ revenues Using Chainalysis, police investigations can also establish connections between victims and estimate the criminals’ revenues. Although Gronager is unwilling to reveal the identity of its customers in law enforcement, he said more than half of the police forces in Europe were using Chainalysis software. “It is also a matter of public record that our customers include Europol in Europe and the FBI in the US,” he said. Chainalysis began to grow its customer base in the banking industry after taking part in the Barclays accelerator programme in 2015 for fintech startups in partnership with incubator firm Techstars. “Working with Barclays has taught us how to engage with the enterprise market,” said Gronager.\n\nAccelerator programme “The accelerator programme also taught us how to raise investment and set up our headquarters in New York City, while Techstars has given us access to its global contacts and a network of several thousand startups, who have helped us to know how to work with certain investors,” he said. According to Gronager, the Chainalysis software is essentially a search engine for blockchain ledgers, and he expects that to become an important revenue driver for the company in future. “In the longer term, we expect blockchain to underlie most financial transactions in future, especially as it can provide unprecedented transparency if you know where to look,” he said. Chainalysis enables financial institutions to receive reports on the blockchain activity of their customers to raise alerts and issues. Read more about ransomware Nearly 40% of businesses were hit by ransomware attacks in the past year, with more than a third of them losing revenue and 20% forced to shut down, a study has revealed.\n\nBusinesses still get caught by ransomware, even though straightforward avoidance methods exist.\n\nThe first half of 2014 saw an increase in online attacks that lock up user data and hold it to ransom.\n\nThe CryptoLocker ransomware caught many enterprises off guard, but there is a defence strategy that works. The software breaks down blockchain activity by different categories so financial institutions can assess the risk of doing business with each of their customers using bitcoin transactions, spot emerging threats from the deep web and investigate ransomware or extortion notes in-house. In the US alone, Gronager said there had been about 5,000 suspicious activity reports about bitcoin transactions in the past year compared with none the year before because the technology did not exist then to enable financial institutions to see what was going on.', ""Bitcoin escrows is a rapidly growing business where the competition is high and so far there’s no clear leader. The market is defined by razor-thin profit margins and so the companies who offer their services first, have an advantage.\n\nEscrow services\n\nOne of Bitcoin’s primary advantages is the freedom with which it can be transferred. Without a central authority in place to authorize payments or impose arbitrary fees and limits, a user can send their Bitcoins to any other user in the world, at any time, without regard for national borders, distance, or regulation.\n\nUnfortunately, this lack of regulation is both a blessing and a curse - a great many people have become victims to all kinds of scams, fraud and hacker attacks. One does not need to dig deep to find plenty of such stories. Someone in the community has even taken time to compile a list of the largest cases.\n\nWhenever someone trades Bitcoin for fiat money, or some sort of goods or services there is no guarantee that the other party will meet their end of the bargain, as there is no default third-party to ensure that the exchange is fulfilled.\n\nSuch state of affairs cannot go unaddressed for long, and soon enough, a response came in the form of different escrow services.\n\nReputations on the line\n\nEscrow is a trusted third-party, which takes Bitcoins from one side, and whatever they are traded for from the other, and sees that they are faithfully exchanged. The earliest examples of escrows were really straightforward: it was a person, or a company, who placed their reputation as an intermediary on the line, and asked for a commission from each trade in return.\n\nBitcointalk, the most popular forum dedicated to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, has become a platform for entrepreneurial escrows working solo, who had to compete with each other for every single trade to make a living.\n\nDedicated websites were also set up, operating in a similar manner, but on a larger scale. Examples of these include LocalBitcoins, where users can exchange Bitcoins for fiat currencies with buyers and sellers from their local area, and bitify, a Bitcoin marketplace with inbuilt escrow system. The market of escrows is defined by razor-thin profit margins and their success is mostly dependent on their reputation and user base volume; hence, the ones who were the first to offer their services, tend to have the largest, unbeatable advantage.\n\nRapidly developing market\n\nBut offering lower fees and working for years to build your reputation is not the only way to compete, and there are more recent services on the market, which are a testament to that. By offering new advantages, they bring real value to their users, and in the process carve out a larger slice of the market.\n\nOne good example of that is Waterhole, a mobile OTC trading and escrow platform. The developers have experience in both hacking and security fields, and they take the underlying idea of ensuring the safety of funds seriously, by going one step further in almost every direction security-wise.\n\nFor instance, they allow an optional three-step verification for the users, consisting of ID, photo and video verification. Several sellers have tested the escrow service at their own discretion and found that the process of selling and buying Bitcoin through Waterhole's service is quite fast compared to other current methods. Waterhole’s most important innovation is that it allows searching for sellers based on your location, which means that you can meet them in person to conclude the deal. Having a physical contact with your counterparty decreases the chances of getting scammed out of your money exponentially, which means that Waterhole is one of the safest solutions for Bitcoin trading on the market.\n\nAnother prominent contender is Raistone. Although the project is still in development, they are going to try and apply the Blockchain technology itself to the business of escrow, in order to decentralize it and eliminate the need for a central custodian entity.\n\nAll in all, Bitcoin escrow is a rapidly developing market. Even more so, as there is no clear leader at the moment. Security remains a critical issue for cryptocurrency users, and in the coming years we should see some great companies taking the lead and solving this problem."", ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article."", 'Ethereum Classic started off as what is perhaps best described as a protest movement, opposing a (perceived) bailout of Ethereum’s leaderless investment venture, The DAO. But the brand new cryptocurrency, which is actually the continuation of the pre-hard forked Ethereum chain, has since surprised many. Its currency, classic ether (ETC) has garnered a spot among the top altcoins by market cap, some big names in the cryptocurrency space endorsed the project and more developers are joining the project. To make it official, Ethereum Classic declared its independence from the former Ethereum project and the Ethereum Foundation last week.\n\nYet, some questions about the future of Ethereum Classic remain. The initial community consists of a diverse group of users, varying from long-time Ethereum purists committed to upholding the original “code is law” ethos, to a subgroup of “Bitcoin maximalists” that really hoped a split would have both sides of the chain fail and just about anything in between these extremes.\n\nTo find out whether, and how, the Ethereum Classic community plans to move forward from here, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to some of its most active members.\n\nA Distinct Vision\n\nIf there is one aspect that binds the Ethereum Classic community to this day, it’s — perhaps unsurprisingly — shared values like immutability and censorship resistance. As formulated in the “Declaration of Independence,"" many Ethereum Classic supporters envision the protocol as an embodiment of the “code is law” mantra, in which there is no room for forks whenever code doesn’t operate as many users expected it would.\n\nElaborating on the explicit publication of these values, project lead Arvicco told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“At least from my point of view and this is how many in our community feel as well, any practical steps we undertake should be based on a firm foundation, laid out in principles. This Declaration of Independence is important, in the same sense way the United States’ Declaration of Independence was important. It turns a mutiny into a revolution, so to say. It may be a formality, but it is an important one.”\n\nNaturally, then, there is still very little sympathy for the Ethereum Foundation’s decision to opt for a hard fork to reimburse The DAO investors. For many, the perceived bailout of the leaderless investment venture was a big mistake and is still illustrative for the net version of Ethereum.\n\nMarcus R. Brown currently maintains the Ethereum Classic fork of cpp-ethereum, also known as eth. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Brown — who joined the Ethereum community late last year — explained:\n\n“After the news of the The DAO hack broke, I watched the community’s response and in particular the mitigation strategies. Although I held a tiny amount of The DAO tokens myself as a curiosity, I did not agree that either a soft or hard fork was the appropriate response. After the hard fork was implemented and deployed, I assumed my ‘side’ had lost the argument and decided to continue to explore Ethereum, albeit more cautiously. But when I discovered Arvicco’s manifesto, I decided to contribute time and resources to the project. I am in 100% agreement [with] the principles as laid out and, in fact, think that most of it lines up with the goals of the original Ethereum project.”\n\nOthers did not hesitate to voice their discontent toward the original Ethereum development community itself, many of whom endorsed and advocated in favor of the hard fork. Like the new Ethereum chain, developers involved with the Ethereum Foundation are by many within the Ethereum Classic community considered morally bankrupt; making a re-united community seem unlikely.\n\nJames Hilliard, a commercial pool operator who manages over 100HG/s worth of Ethereum mining farms and mining pools for clients, has been encouraging his clients to mine on Ethereum Classic.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he said:\n\n“I largely view the Ethereum Foundation as a corrupt group, that’s only in it to get rich. And I think this fork event really caused them to show their true colors. They care about their own profits above everything else ... I admire that Ethereum Classic does not want a benevolent dictator at all, just like those in Bitcoin don’t want one. Satoshi leaving Bitcoin development was a good decision in my opinion… that makes arguments from authority much harder.”\n\nCreating a New Roadmap\n\nMoving forward, uniting the community may be a little bit more tricky. Initially, the Ethereum Classic project planned to follow the Ethereum Foundation’s every move, essentially copying any update to their own chain. By now, however, the Ethereum Classic community has begun working on its own roadmap. While a work in progress, this could mean that the difference between the two sides of the chain will further diverge over time.\n\nCharles Hoskinson was one of the original founders of Ethereum and one of the early public faces of that project. But he left the team almost two years ago, even before the protocol was ever launched. Only recently, he announced his return as developer for — what is now called — Ethereum Classic.\n\nExplaining his motivation to work on a distinct vision for Ethereum Classic, Hoskinson said:\n\n“A protest movement can’t live forever. We’ve seen that with Occupy Wall Street and there are many similar examples. It’s also not what I find interesting personally. I hope to see Ethereum Classic, this community, emancipate into a valuable network, a real thing that doesn’t merely exist to remind Vitalik and the other Ethereum developers of the mistake they made. If we can do that I would love to participate.”\n\nA similar sentiment was echoed by Avtar Sehra, another developer to have joined the project, who also works on global strategy for Ethereum Classic. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he said:\n\n“Let\'s be honest. Ethereum Classic can not compete with Ethereum in the fundamentals, funding and traction. For this reason Ethereum Classic will need to become something different. Focus now is on removing the difficulty bomb originally built in by Ethereum developers, that is designed to eventually force the protocol to a new hard fork. We want to fix the replay issue, port as many clients as possible and develop new ones, stabilize the network, build a community and establish decentralized administration operations.”\n\nProof of Stake\n\nA popular sentiment within the Ethereum Classic community is to treat the Ethereum Foundation side of the chain as a sort of testnet for now. The forked version of the Ethereum chain could serve as an experimental testbed for innovation — which in many ways, it already is. Whether or not experiments succeed should determine whether they should be adopted by Ethereum Classic — or not.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious example of this, though not the only one, is a potential transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This is scheduled to replace the current proof-of-work system, at least on the forked Ethereum chain. But the Ethereum Classic community is generally skeptical that proof-of-stake — where order of transactions is determined by coin-holders rather than miners — is the best way forward.\n\nAccording to Arvicco:\n\n“While proof-of-work and — just recently — hybrid proof-of-work/proof-of-stake security guarantees are well analyzed in peer-reviewed papers, there is nothing like this for proof-of-stake in general, or for Ethereum’s promised proof-of-stake system ‘Casper’ in particular. It seems there are also concerns in light of the key blockchain characteristic of openness, as coin-holders effectively act as gatekeepers. And from a practical standpoint, proof-of-stake systems are known to have multiple weaknesses and vectors of attacks. Vitalik promises everyone a miracle and we have to believe him. Well, maybe he will deliver. Maybe he won’t. So, letting the new Ethereum play out all the risks associated with this transition first makes total sense.”\n\nSince quitting the Ethereum development team, Hoskinson has set-up his own company. And within the company, developers have created a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm they believe works. Hoskinson, therefore, doesn’t doubt the concept itself. But he does agree it’s premature to roll out the mechanism as a consensus model on Ethereum Classic.\n\nInstead, he believes it may be a good governance tool:\n\n“One of the main challenges we face as a community, apart from a technical road map, is the establishment of a governance process. We no longer have a Vitalik, a benevolent dictator for life and I don’t think anyone in the Ethereum Classic community would want that back. Luckily, there are ideas out there on how to better handle protocol forks. I think we can learn from altcoins, like Dash and Tezos. And indeed I believe proof-of-stake types of systems could be very useful in this regard.”\n\nBitcoin Maximalists\n\nThat said, not everyone is equally excited about this newfound inspiration. While the heart of the Ethereum Classic community consists of eager participants, a contingent of the original supporters did consider the project to be a protest movement more than anything else. And some of these are slowly but surely losing interest, often to re-focus on Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the earliest community members and investors in Ethereum Classic after the hard fork goes by the pseudonyms “Steve” or “MrHodl.” The self-admitted “Bitcoin maximalist” who’d rather see the new Ethereum fail rather than Ethereum Classic succeed, would have preferred to see this project stick to the original plan.\n\n“At first I was excited about Ethereum Classic because there was no doubt in my mind that a market would form and develop around the original Ethereum chain,” Steve said to Bitcoin Magazine. “I was hoping that the vision of the Ethereum Foundation would live on, but with immutability. When I started to get the feeling that Ethereum Classic was going in a different direction, I simply lost interest and sold most of my classic ether. To me it became just another altcoin.”\n\nHilliard, too, sees little real future potential in either version of Ethereum. While he thinks Ethereum Classic might have a slightly bigger chance on long-term success, the most likely scenario for him is that both will eventually wither.\n\n“Long term, I think both the new Ethereum and Ethereum Classic will have a lot of difficulty with security due to immaturity of this area of computer science and the difficulty in writing provably correct code,” Hilliard said. “Maybe Ethereum Classic will have more security focus… but to be honest most of the top talent there works on Bitcoin. And it will likely be difficult to recruit top security experts that are capable doing proper code and architecture design. I find Turing-complete blockchains to be quite risky in general, but if there’s any future in that domain it’s probably in Bitcoin sidechains like Rootstock which appear to be putting security first.”\n\nHoskinson published his own thoughts on an Ethereum Classic roadmap here.', 'Convicted Ponzi scheme operator Trendon Shavers is now insinuating the major unidentified debtor cited in his defense against the SEC may have been Mark Karpeles, CEO of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.\n\nThe claims, while veiled, stem from a new interview for the popular industry podcast Bitcoin Uncensored, in which Shavers faced questions about the history of Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST), an investment operation later deemed a Ponzi scheme in multiple court litigations. Investors lost as much as 700,000 BTC through the scheme, which collapsed in late 2012.\n\nIn a court deposition, Shavers claimed that BTCST\'s largest debtor, who was unidentified in public records, defaulted on a 202,000 BTC loan, thereby triggering the capital shortfall that accelerated its demise. However, he would go on to admit that ""he has no proof at all of the lending activities he supposedly undertook for BTCST"", including the major borrower.\n\nWhere does Karpeles factor into this? During the interview, Shavers references the debtor as someone connected to ""a very, very big exchange"" but stopped short of identifying the figure.\n\nWhen pressed by co-hosts Chris DeRose and Joshua Unseth, he said the person was a ""very well-known"" exchange operator.\n\nWhen asked if the debtor ""[has] black hair and a cat"" (a reference to both Karpeles’ physical appearance and his cat Tibanne), Shavers began to laugh, and jokingly asked, ""Does he speak Japanese?""\n\nAt that point, Jason Seibert, Shavers’ attorney, taking part in the interview, intervened. He went on to say that ""this is one of the things he can’t talk about"".\n\nSeibert declined to comment for this story when reached.\n\nClaims scrutinized\n\nThat Karpeles would seek a massive loan seems plausible given that Mt Gox’s money problems predate its collapse by as many as three years.\n\nA 2015 report from security firm WizSec posited that Mt Gox’s bitcoin holdings were far below its estimated liabilities for much of the period between 2011 and 2014. Further, The Daily Beast reported in May that the exchange was short by as much as 80,000 bitcoins by the time that Karpeles purchased it in mid-2011.\n\nYet, observers have sharply questioned Shavers\' suggestion that a major loan default was behind the BTCST collapse.\n\nWhen reached for comment, WizSec said that there’s no evidence that a major loan was issued in the period claimed by Shavers.\n\n""There are no single transactions anywhere near that size on the blockchain for that time period,” the firm said, adding:\n\n""Shavers\' wallet, as best it can be reconstructed, only shows a steady exponentially growing sequence of receives and sends, peaking in July/August 2012, as would be expected from the frantic end of a ponzi scheme.""\n\nWhile it\'s tempting to suggest that the funds could represent the 200,000 BTC discovered after the exchange’s collapse, WizSec was equally dismissive.\n\n""To be clear, there is absolutely no connection between the 202,000 BTC now held by the Mt Gox trustee and Trendon Shavers,"" the company said.\n\nDoubling down\n\nWhen pressed on the claims, Shavers is said to have claimed that the loan was issued by way of a coin mixer or tumbler, a process which obscures the transactive origin of bitcoins by mingling them with other funds.\n\nAccording to WizSec, this could be true if the funds were distributed in small amounts or if they were collected into an account separate from the known BTCST addresses.\n\nBut that second hypothetical would only be valid if Shavers actually possessed the 202,000 BTC he claimed to have loaned, which WizSec doubted the veracity of in comments.\n\n""There\'s no convincing evidence that Shavers ever even had 202,000 at any single point in time in the first place,"" the firm said.\n\nComplicating matters is that the alleged personal loan was perhaps unrelated to any funds held on the exchange at the time of its demise.\n\nAn analysis of known claimants in the ongoing Mt Gox lawsuit reveals that Shavers is not listed as ever having registered a claim to any lost funds. A list of known claimants spans 1,422 Excel pages.\n\nListen to the full Bitcoin Uncensored podcast here.

Thomas also discusses the Bitcoin block size debate and the impossibility of governance, a new topic that has become popular in the Bitcoin space recently.\n\n“Blockchains are a pain to work with,” writes Thomas. “Harmony and consensus are valuable. But harmony taken to the extreme becomes a detriment. In the Lego Movie utopia, ‘everything is awesome’ only on the surface. Behind the scenes, there is tremendous diversity and a rapidly changing world, which doesn’t match the established consensus.”\n\nThomas’ website is weusecoins.com – “a single resource” where Bitcoin is “explained for the average non-technical user.” Thomas YouTube video, “What is Bitcoin?” – has more than 6.8 million views.\n\n“The fact that one corner of the system can be updated and good ideas can eventually spread to the system as a whole has been essential for the Web’s ability to keep pace with technological innovation,” he writes.\n\n“In a blockchain like ethereum, everyone has to think the same,” he warns. He plugs Ripple’s Interledger Protocol at the end, describing it as a more flexible and individualized way to send or receive payments.

Below are the results, categorized by region and level of disclosure required.\n\nFinancial privacy: Bitcoin vs. banks\n\nOne of the main advantages of using Bitcoin over traditional funding methods is privacy. When a Bitcoin transaction is sent, its record is permanent and public on the blockchain, but not tied to any particular identity.\n\nMany users, such as those who frequented the Silk Road, prefer Bitcoin for exactly this reason: it’s anonymous and private.\n\nHowever, one of the major challenges of using Bitcoin is the limited number of merchants and services that accept it as payment. Enter Bitcoin debit cards, a product that takes Bitcoin and converts it into currency for use at traditional merchants.\n\nThe challenge with Bitcoin debit cards is that, by and large, they tend to require the same level of financial disclosure of traditional financial institutions.\n\nWhile this is still an advantage over banks, which can shut down the account of a customer at any time under any pretense (especially under pressure from government), it still does not constitute financial privacy.\n\nFull identification (US)\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase has a debit card, the Shift card, which pulls Bitcoin directly from the customer’s Coinbase wallet for each transaction. This is convenient, since it saves customers from having to keep their Bitcoin wallet separate from their card’s wallet, and topping up the card’s balance prior to transactions, instead making using Shift one unified, streamlined process. In this sense, Shift is closest to a true Bitcoin debit card.\n\nUnfortunately, the Shift card is not available in every state in the US, so potential customers in New Hampshire, Connecticut, New York, Hawaii, Maryland, Georgia, West Virginia, Minnesota, and Arkansas are out of luck.\n\nAs far as privacy is concerned, Coinbase is fully compliant with AML/KYC regulations, and as such requires full customer identification. We attempted to reach Coinbase regarding privacy with Bitcoin debit cards, but company representatives declined to comment.\n\nBitPay\n\nAt present, BitPay is the only Bitcoin debit card available across the entire United States, in all of the 50 states. Unlike Coinbase’s shift, and like every other card on this list, BitPay’s card is a prepaid card with a balance in traditional currency (once converted from Bitcoin).\n\nBitPay requires full identification in order to use its card. However, unlike every single other card, it does not require the submission of any identifying documents. Instead, BitPay requires users to submit a Social Security number during their application process. While this amounts to the same level of financial disclosure as any other card, it is still a vastly streamlined process, making BitPay’s the most painless verified Bitcoin debit card to acquire.\n\nWhen contacted, BitPay representatives declined a comment to be quoted, but drew from the terms and conditions to answer the question regarding privacy:\n\n“Federal law requires all financial institutions and their third parties to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who obtains a Card. What this means for you: When you apply for a Card, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, social security number or country identification number, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver\'s license or other documentation bearing your photo as verification of your identity.”\n\nFull identification (EU etc.)\n\nXapo\n\nOne of the main cards in use in Europe and beyond, the Xapo card gained fame for its use by Uber in Argentina after the ride-sharing company was denied service by traditional card companies. The card is currently not available in a long list of countries, foremost among them being the United States. It also requires full financial disclosure.\n\nAnni Rautio, Product Manager for Xapo, does not think financial anonymity is possible for Bitcoin debit cards, unless Bitcoin is used for a prepaid debit card.\n\n“As long as debit cards - bitcoin or otherwise - are connected to long-term players in the market, such as Visa or MasterCard, anonymity is not 100% possible. The only way I can think of an \'anonymous\' debit card are pre-paid/pre-loadable debit cards that you can buy at places like CVS. Their function, however, is more like a gift card and those tend to be inconvenient in the long run.”\n\nRautio pointed out that the main point behind these cards is not maximum privacy, but rather maximum convenience.\n\n“I\'d say the balance between anonymity - or privacy to certain extent - and convenience is providing personal information. Some people prefer convenience over anonymity, others prefer anonymity over convenience. Xapo\'s goal is to bring bitcoin to the everyday life for people around the world. Our bet is this will happen only if we can make bitcoin accessible, easy to understand and ""mainstream"" enough so that large scale adoption of bitcoin can continue. Today this means that we\'ve chosen to provide a highly convenient product over providing a more niche approach to anonymity.”\n\nSatoshiTango\n\nAnother card used by Uber in Argentina, the SatoshiTango card also requires full financial identification. It is available in most countries, excepting the United States.\n\nMatias Bari, CEO of SatoshiTango, explained that the usual identification requirements are still in place, though are less stringent than those required by banks.\n\nBari says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“To open an account at SatoshiTango you need to verify your identity with a proof of ID and a proof of address. We need to apply the proper KYC and AML policies to comply with international regulations. You don’t need the same level of verification than bank account holders but you can’t request a prepaid card or even buy and sell Bitcoins without letting us know who you are.”\n\nBitwala\n\nAnother premier Bitcoin debit card by the company that gained fame for its ability to pay bills with Bitcoin, the Bitwala card is also not available in the United States. Notable, and unique, among all the cards mentioned here is Bitwala’s integration with the ShapeShift exchange, meaning that a customer could top up their debit card with cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.\n\nJeff Gallas of Bitwala explained that their card requires the usual forms of identification, and that all current Bitcoin debit cards likely require the same.\n\nHe says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“To our knowledge, all Bitcoin debit cards on the market currently do require some sort of identification. For the Bitwala Bitcoin debit card (both physical and virtual), we\'re required to undergo certain AML/KYC requirements which include verification of the customers details.”\n\nHowever, Gallas mentioned that, in the future, Bitwala may be able to provide solutions for those without the proper forms of government identification.\n\nHe notes:\n\n“We are working on offering a solution which is especially targeted at the so-called unbanked, who don\'t always have the required documents (e.g. because they don\'t actually own a proper piece of identification). This card could be obtained through providing only same basic details, but would be limited in its total transfer limits.”\n\nCryptoPay\n\nMainly a European card, CryptoPay’s Bitcoin debit card functions much in the same ways as others. It is also unavailable in the United States, and requires the same forms of identification for unlimited use.\n\nGeorge Basiladze, CryptoPay’s CEO, pointed out that all cards in the EU must comply with similar regulations:“All around Europe there are common KYC and AML requirements for issuing debit cards.”\n\nWirex\n\nFinally, Wirex, recently rebranded from E-Coin, offers a similar style of Bitcoin debit card as the others, along with an easily accessible app. This also means that unlimited cards must comply with the same identification regulations as the rest.\n\nLimited privacy options\n\nCryptoPay\n\nAs previously mentioned, CryptoPay requires identification in order to unlock unlimited user. However, they do provide the option for an unverified card. This means that a customer does not need to provide financial regulation as long as they stay below a very low lifetime limit for the card.\n\nAsked if Bitcoin debit cards could ever be private or anonymous, CryptoPay’s CEO George Basiladze added that privacy (and not divulging identifying documents) is an option for customers willing to deal with lower lifetime limits for a card.\n\nHe says:\n\n“There are lower limits for unverified users (2500 Euros per lifetime) and higher limits for verified users.”\n\nBasiladze also had strong words for any who would put on a pretense of providing a full-service Bitcoin debit card with no verification.\n\nHe concludes:\n\n“In case a debit card provider offers full, unlimited and anonymous cards, this means that the operator either breaks the law or is lying, thus users should avoid it.”\n\nWirex\n\nSimilar to CryptoPay, Wirex, in addition to providing full-service cards with identification, allows customers to continue unverified for a while.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Dmitry and George of Wirex confirmed that it is possible for a Bitcoin debit card to be private/anonymous, provided that lower lifetime limits are considered acceptable.\n\nThey say to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“At the moment, it is technically possible for Bitcoin debit cards to be private or anonymous. As long as the client is happy with the low card limits, there is no requirement to provide any documents at all.”\n\nSadly, according to Dmitry and George, the world of completely private Bitcoin debit cards may very well end soon, forcing all customers under government identification regulations.\n\nThey conclude:\n\n“Nonetheless, the regulation of the prepaid card industry is getting stricter. For example, the limits for unverified cardholders will be lowering soon. A number of reports try to establish links between prepaid cards and fraud/other illegal activities. Therefore, we do not expect anonymous debit cards in the near future, at least based on Visa/MasterCard platforms.”\n\nFull-privacy?\n\nOn the extreme of the privacy spectrum is (was? used to be? was only imaginary?) BitPlastic. The company has a bare-bones website reminiscent of early e-commerce sites.\n\nThe lengthy FAQ promises full anonymity for all cards, but raises all kinds of red flags, including a one-time $3,500 non-refundable loading, zero refunds once shipped, zero possibility of transferring balance back from the card, zero recourse if a pin is lost, zero assistance if the card is lost, and a 5% chance that the card is either lost in the mail or seized by customs (in which case no refund will be possible).\n\nWhen contacted for an interview via the site’s contact form, BitPlastic rejected the message rejected under security concerns. They were then emailed to the address given, which turned up undeliverable. Maybe perfect privacy with debit cards is a myth after all...\n\nBest private Bitcoin debit card solution\n\nEven if no perfect solution exists for total privacy with convenience for Bitcoin debit cards, a workable compromise can be reached. A user wishing to maintain privacy can acquire an unverified card and either stay below the limit, or simply acquire multiple unverified cards, moving to a new one once the lifetime.\n\nWhile this approach can be vastly inconvenient with heavy card use (possibly a new card per month or more), if major bills are handled separately, all expenses possible are paid directly in Bitcoin, and almost all other purchases are handled by either Bitcoin gift cards or cash, card use can be kept to a minimum. Using a Bitcoin debit card in this way, an unverified card may be able to last a year or possibly more.\n\nAlternatively, certain customers may wish to have no lifetime limits on a card, but still desire greater privacy than usually offered by full verification. An alternative approach for those with two or more citizenships is to verify a card under one citizenship, and have it denominated in the currency of the country where the customer actually lives and works.\n\nThat can help keep financial activity visible to only the authorities with the least current dealings with the citizen, ensuring that no one party knows too much.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Bitcoin debit cards, read our previous article on this topic «6 Cards Battle for Bitcoin Supremacy, Bitcoin Debit Card Comparison Test».\n\nDisclaimer: None of the above should be construed as legal advice.

The Bitcoin exchange, Bitfinex, says leaning on its users to cover the loss is the best way to avoid insolvency.\n\nTokyo: For years, Tian Jia made the kind of returns on his money that investors in the rest of the world could only dream of.\n\nThe 29-year-old Beijing-based programmer had $440,000 (Dh1.6 million) on deposit at the Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Bitfinex until last week and, on good days, would wake up to find a couple thousand more dollars in his account than when he went to sleep. The earnings came from lending his dollars to traders who wanted to leverage their bets. The exchange allowed lenders like Tian to set their own rates, and he says margin traders paid as much as 700 per cent annualised interest to borrow dollars. At times, he earned as much in one day as holders of US Treasuries earn in a decade.\n\n“The returns were really great,” Tian said. “Bitfinex was quite innovative and among the first to come out with products including margin lending.”\n\nThat lucrative practice came to a stunning halt last week after Bitfinex said it was hacked for 119,756 bitcoins, worth about $70 million at current prices. While his US dollars were not stolen, Tian is being forced to forfeit 36 per cent of his deposit”-about $160,000”-as part of a rescue plan the exchange is imposing on all its customers. He said that will more than wipe out the profits he made through lending money.\n\nLegal proceedings\n\nBitfinex, which was the largest bitcoin exchange for US dollar trading before the attack, says leaning on its users to cover the loss is the best way to avoid insolvency that would tie up deposits with legal proceedings for years. The exchange hopes to repay the lost money: Customers are receiving tokens that Bitfinex says will one day be redeemable for shares in its parent company, which would give its customers a stake in future profits. Zane Tackett, a director at Bitfinex, said the exchange is also offering to pay anyone who helps recover the bitcoins a reward of 5 per cent of the money, a bounty that could total more than $3 million.\n\nThe episode has triggered legal consultations and soul-searching among Tian and others like him. Whether they accept the exchange’s offer or fire back with lawsuits will determine the latest chapter in bitcoin’s colourful history.\n\n“Some users are still reaching out to lawyers to weigh their options, but going through litigation does mean a lot of risks,” Tian said. “The losses aren’t as bad as I initially expected, but there are still a lot of questions regarding the method of compensation.”\n\nAmong the unanswered questions: How did Bitfinex calculate the 36 per cent haircut? Is the exchange itself shouldering any losses? What are the legal guarantees that the new tokens will be redeemable in the future? The exchange did not reply to multiple inquiries from Bloomberg. The tokens, which were issued at a total value of about $70 million, immediately fell to about $21 million in their trading debut Thursday on Bitfinex.\n\nBankruptcy\n\nThe discount suggests little confidence in the exchange’s future. “Bitfinex has to prove that it can survive first,” said Peter Ng, a Hong Kong-based user who is facing more than $200,000 in losses. “We need to see how transparent the company is going forward. If you lose trust, then you lose your customers.”\n\nStill, he says he had feared even worse. In February 2014, Tokyo-based Mt Gox”-then the world’s largest bitcoin exchange”-announced that $480 million was stolen by hackers and filed for bankruptcy weeks later. Its users are still waiting for liquidators to return a fraction of the deposits that did not disappear.\n\nLitigation against Bitfinex could also drag out since Hong Kong, like most countries, has little legal infrastructure in place for regulating bitcoin exchanges or protecting owners of digital currencies. The city’s central bank has said bitcoin falls outside its authority. KC Chan, the secretary for financial services and the treasury, has said the government doesn’t yet see a need for legislation.\n\nBitcoin exchanges could still face legal liabilities under general anti-money laundering laws, and bitcoin transactions may be subject to rules on commodity trading, according to the law firm Kobre & Kim. Customers may also try to recover funds based on claims of negligence or manipulation on the part of the exchange, according to Jef Klazen, a New York-based partner at the firm.\n\n“If your account wasn’t actually hacked but received this 36 per cent haircut, you might be able to pursue a legal claim on the theory that Bitfinex misappropriated your funds because it made a unilateral decision to take money out of your account,” Klazen said. Still, he says a lot will depend on what kind of legal contracts users signed with Bitfinex when opening accounts. He reviewed the terms and conditions on the exchange’s website and thinks that disputes may need to be resolved using an arbitrator selected by the exchange.\n\n“Depending on what jurisdiction you’re trying to sue in, a court might view that as foreclosing your ability to pursue a lawsuit,” said Klazen.\n\nMargin lending\n\nWhile security experts have stressed for years that users should minimise deposits at bitcoin exchanges”-a painful lesson from Mt. Gox”-many ignored that advice due to Bitfinex’s unique margin lending system. The platform allowed traders to multiply the size of their bets by borrowing money, but the practice required both lenders and borrowers to keep their funds at the exchange. That made it a prime target for hackers. About $38 million was on loan to margin traders immediately before the attack, according to bfxdata.com, a site that tracks activity on Bitfinex.\n\nAmong those who borrowed heavily is 34-year old Zhuo Shuoji. The Beijing-based trader says his annualised borrowing rates were usually less than ten per cent, but would jump to extraordinary levels when bitcoin volatility rose. Despite the high cost, he says he made good profits until the hack. Now, he just wants to get back whatever money he can.\n\n“The key is for us to get our remaining funds back first,” said Zhuo, adding that he is facing about $700,000 in potential losses. “Then we need to see that this exchange can remain in operation for the tokens to have any value.”\n\nThe risk for Bitfinex is that if too many customers like Zhou pull their money out and don’t come back, profits from trading fees and margin lending will tumble, throwing into question the exchange’s plan to earn back the loss over time. Still, Bitfinex’s ability to begin restoring operations, defend against follow-up attacks, and keep users from completely giving up hope has earned it some credibility.\n\n“The way the whole thing was handled is already an improvement compared with older cases where either the exchange went bust or let users shoulder all the loss,” said Tian. “They found a middle way and solutions created could become a road map for the future.”', 'Two competing Bitcoin forums on popular social media website strike a startlingly different tone when it comes to one of the most popular and influential corporations in the Bitcoin industry: Coinbase.\n\nBitcoiners like to express disdain for leading Bitcoin wallet service and exchange Coinbase on r/Bitcoin, the Bitcoin forum moderated by the controversial administrator Theymos, who faces criticism for censorship. R/btc, which sprouted as an alternative to r/bitcoin, strikes a more positive tone when it comes to the San Francisco startup.\n\nOn Reddit, where Bitcoiners love to engage in lively debate, post after post appears disparaging the San Francisco-based Bitcoin startup. For example:\n\n“People seem to hate coinbase. What is the next user-friendly place I can easily buy and sell coins?”\n\nWhy is everyone bashing Coinbase?\n\n“What’s with all the Coinbase hate?”\n\nEven on Coinbase’s own help Community, a post entitled “I hate coinbase” shares the sentiment.\n\nSome have wondered if Coinbase is the victim of a PR attack.\n\nWith Bitcoiners expressing consistent skepticism – most recently people lobbied claims that the Bitcoin and ether exchange is bankrupt – CEO Brian Armstrong felt the need to allay fears that Coinbase is out of money. He did so with a tweet:\n\nCoinbase has all funds to cover user deposits. If you prefer to cntrl you own private keys, see our multisig vault https://t.co/Dt1EdiohpG — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) August 1, 2016\n\nNo cryptographic proof of funds was executed, a controversial move for an industry which prides itself on such verifiability. Skepticism remains among rabble-rousers within the Bitcoin industry.\n\nr/Bitcoin – a central gathering point for the self-proclaimed “Bitcoin Community” – has long been unkind to Armstrong’s company, as users regularly complain about Coinbase’s interpretation of know your customer and anti-money laundering policies, which results in account closures. As a money transmitter, Coinbase has a duty to monitor its user’s transactions for suspicious activity. Bitcoin ideologists don’t like this.\n\nOne Reddit user recounted an incident which began in June 2015 when he began exploring the code to Coinbase’s multi sig vault, where the user held “anywhere from $2,500 worth of btc to $10,000.” He became interested in Coinbase’s “Vault” system and began experimenting with it. He purportedly found a “major exploit” which allowed him to put his account into negative balance while withdrawing the bitcoin, resulting in the user being able to cash out infinite bitcoins.\n\n“Instead of abusing the exploit i have decided to help Coinbase fix the exploit by telling them step to step instructions on how to reproduce the bug on hackerone,” he wrote.\n\nThe Reddit user laments Coinbase’s “measly $5,000 bounty” for reporting the bug. “I was expecting to get upwards of $25,000,” he said.\n\nThe user reasons, “I helped them fix something that could have damaged them in hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe even millions if the exploit was executed correct with the right amount of people.”\n\nAfter the user received the bounty, Coinbase banned the user’s account The user could not withdraw bitcoins. After further investigation, the user discovered another exploit and notified them. It took Coinbase months to reply, according to the Redditor.\n\nWhether Coinbase’s actions were “compliance and banking” culture (the likely answer)-or more sinister- is often debated on Reddit.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for posts to appear on r/Bitcoin lamenting how Coinbase shut down a user account. One of the more popular examples is a post entitled, “Coinbase stole $25,000 from me.” A series of complaints on Reddit even resulted in an article on Gizmodo wherein users discussed how hackers had stolen their bitcoin held on the Coinbase platform.\n\nReddit consistently upvotes posts on Coinbase’s lackluster service. “Sold ~$5800 worth of BTC through Coinbase this week. $2490 has never been deposited. Unresponsive support. Please upvote for visibility”, earned 3,629 upvotes, for instance.\n\nBitBet.Us last month posted on Reddit its alleged discovery that Coinbase “has silently strated tracking how their customers spend the coins purchased on their site.”\n\nThe Bitcoin-based gambling site wrote: “One of our users was threatened by Coinbase with account closure after he placed a bet on our site,” according to BitBet.Us. “The implication is basically that Coinbase is now officially in the business of deciding of deciding what you can and can’t do with your own money.”\n\nMany Bitcoiners decry how Coinbase is no different than VISA and Paypal. A movement to take Coinbase off bitcoin.org resulted in division and debate between bitcoiners.\n\nLast month, headlines did not help Coinbase’s reputation within the Bitcoin community. In July, headlines detailed how Coinbase reportedly helped the FBI to shutdown Kickass Torrents and how the US Secret Service seized $13,000 from a Coinbase account. Armstrong has been very public about his belief that compliance is important for the future of digital currency.\n\nOf course, the nature of Reddit makes drawing conclusions from posts on the site difficult to do. The site is routinely rigged, and even the Bitcoin space has taken note thereof. Still, Bitcoiners hold major debates there, and companies often claim posts on subreddits represent an opportunity for the Bitcoin “Community” to comment on the industry’s important issues.\n\nOn another popular Reddit Bitcoin forum, the subredit r/btc, users discuss the dislike for Coinbase demonstrated in r/Bitcoin. Some conjecture it began when Armstrong advocated for larger block sizes. But the distaste predates the block size debate, and is likely more rooted in Coinbase’s decision to abide by the law. Bitcoin’s anarchist sect, deeply rooted in bitcoin’s history, see Bitcoin above and beyond traditional financial regulation.\n\nWhen I reached out to Armstrong for this post, he deeply criticized an earlier version. He called speculation on r/Bitcoin “wildly inaccurate.” He pointed to the deep divide between the two Reddit sub-forums, saying this caused “a lot of bias.” I suppose he considered I had fallen for the bias.\n\nSix months ago on Reddit’s r/btc, a different tone than r/Bitcoin perhaps highlighted that divide: “Just want to say a big thank you to Coinbase for their professionalism over an issue that occurred lately. Were lucky to have you guys in the bitcoin community.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Demian Brener is founder and CEO of Smart Contract Solutions, a firm working to provide tools to build businesses using blockchain-based software tokens.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Brener discusses the different ways startups are seeking to leverage these new creations, and the various business models taking shape in the evolving space.\n\nCompanies we\'ve never heard of are launching IPOs before our very eyes.\n\nBut instead of ringing the IPO bell after years of operations, they are going public on day one, and instead of raising money by selling their company stock, they are building distributed networks and selling their own tokens.\n\nThis new way of building companies is what Fred Ehrsam , founder of Coinbase , described as the ""decentralized business model"".\n\nYet, many of the established rules about building and investing in businesses don\'t apply to this new model. What can we learn from the companies going down this road?\n\nTokens\n\nThe mechanics of a token crowdsale are directly related to the kind of token issued.\n\nWe identified three types of tokens:\n\nDebt Tokens\n\nEquity Tokens\n\nUser Tokens.\n\nUser tokens\n\nUser tokens , or \'appcoins\' as Naval Ravikant and Balaji Srinivasan have called them, are a form of digital currency needed to access the service provided by the distributed network.\n\nAs Union Square Venture managing partner Albert Wenger explains, you can think of these as tokens you buy at a fair to get on a ride.\n\nIn ethereum, for example, you need ether to build distributed apps on the platform. In the case of Sia, a distributed storage system, you need to own Siacoins to store files in the network.\n\nUser tokens are earned by providing value to these networks.\n\nContributions can take the form of mining, as in bitcoin, ethereum and Sia, or publishing stories, as in Steemit. Since user tokens are on a blockchain, they can be easily redeemed for any local or cryptocurrency.\n\nEquity tokens\n\nEquity tokens are used to finance the development of the network, but are not needed to access the services provided by the underlying protocol. As its name suggests, we can see \'equity tokens\' as cryptographic shares of a network.\n\nIn exchange for investment, equity token holders are entitled to ""dividends"" in the form of revenue sharing or transaction fees in the network. For example, in the case of Sia, 3.9% of all successful storage payouts go to the holders of Siafunds, their equity token.\n\nIn many cases, these equity tokens represent shares of a distributed autonomous organization (DAO). A DAO\'s code is responsible for issuing the tokens, holding the money collected from the token sale, and contracting a company to develop the network.\n\nBesides receiving a pro-rated reward, equity token holders in the form of DAO shares are usually entitled to pledge on proposals for how the investment money will be used.\n\nThat\'s the case of Digix, an asset-tokenisation platform built on ethereum. DGD token holders:\n\nReceive a reward on the transaction fees of the Digix Gold Network Are able to submit and vote proposals on the DigixDAO.\n\nDebt Tokens\n\nA third type of token is the \'debt token\'.\n\nWe can see these as a \'short term loan\' to the network, in exchange for an interest rate on the amount lent. Steemit is one of the few networks with debt tokens, issued in the form of Steem Dollars.\n\nSteem, the cryptocurrency mined by the network, can be used to buy Steem Power or Steem Dollars. Holders of Steem Dollars receive a ~10% interest rate, paid in Steem Dollars.\n\nSteem Dollars are unique to the economics of the Steemit protocol.\n\nThrough buying Steem Dollars, people can invest in the network with sufficient liquidity, without committing to the two-year vesting period to which Steem Power holders are subjected.\n\nWe see networks with multiple combinations.\n\nThese include networks with:\n\nBoth user and equity tokens (Sia, Digix)\n\nOnly user tokens (bitcoin, ethereum)\n\nOnly equity tokens (Golem, SingularDTV)\n\nUser, equity and debt tokens (Steemit).\n\nThe combination depends on the unique dynamics and economics of the network.\n\nCrowdsales\n\nThe type of token typically dictates the mechanics of its crowdsale.\n\nPre-sale of User Tokens\n\n\n\nTo sell user tokens, companies tend to:\n\nPublish a white paper defining the specifications of the network and a roadmap for its future development. Publicly announce the token and release the source code prior to creating the first token. Deploy the network and secure user tokens via mining. Alternatively, allocate a portion of the pre-sale tokens to the founding team as a reward for ideating and developing the network. Advertise the network and sell user tokens to anyone, anywhere. Work to grow the number of people using, building apps on top and maintaining the network.\n\nAs the network grows, demand for the token increases, leading to a rise in the user token price. This is what we call the \'Nakamoto business model\'. Satoshi got its reward not by pre-mining bitcoins, but by being the first believer and supporter of the network.\n\nSteemit followed the Nakamoto business model as well. The company wrote the code to power the Steemit distributed network, announced it to the public and secured ~80% of the initial STEEM via mining. The project plans to keep 20%, sell 20% to raise money and give away 40% to attract users/referrers.\n\nEthereum’s case is a bit different. Its pre-sale consisted of distributing private keys to buyers as a software access token to use the future network. Ethereum raised over $18m worth of bitcoin in the form of 60m ETH tokens created, where 12m ETH (20%) were retained by the development team.\n\nWhen ethereum launched, buyers received their ether as the first blocks were mined.\n\nCrowdsale of equity tokens\n\nFor equity tokens, companies tend to:\n\nPublish a white paper defining the specifications of the network and a roadmap for its future development. Write a smart contract for a DAO, with a pre-defined number of equity tokens allocated to the company founders. Make the company the provider of the DAO, in charge of developing the network in exchange for a payment. Advertise the DAO crowdsale and sell equity tokens to anyone, anywhere. Use that money to pay the company for their development work. Work to make the network grow to increase the value of the equity token, and collect rewards based on the increased network usage.\n\nDigix reached its $5.5m total within 12 hours by following these steps.\n\nSince DigixGlobal is the company that ideated the network, published the white paper, wrote the DAO smart contract in ethereum and holds a substantial amount of equity tokens, they became the default service provider of the DigixDAO.\n\nRegulation on token crowdsales\n\nThe laws that govern the issuance and sale of cryptographic tokens depend on the jurisdiction in which these events take place.\n\nThere are countries like Singapore and Switzerland where virtual currencies are not considered securities nor legal tender.\n\nIn the US, the Howey test is used to evaluate the sale of securities.\n\nUnder the Howey test, an instrument is a security if it A) involves an investment of money or other tangible or definable consideration used in B) a common enterprise with C) a reasonable expectation of profits to be D) derived primarily from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.\n\nThe public sale of securities to US citizens is overseen by the SEC, rendering it illegal to perform such an act without its permission.\n\nIndustry thought leaders, like non-profit advocacy group Coin Center and Harvard Berkman\'s Primavera de Filippi, suggest the issuance of user and equity tokens may constitute the sale of securities under the Howey test. But in reality, the power of these tokens goes beyond our understanding of traditional securities.\n\nWe also know the SEC is working on ways to rule blockchains as transfer agents. The actual impact of this regulation on the issuance of tokens is still unknown.\n\nConnecting tokens to the legacy world\n\nWe see four different approaches used to carry out a legal and compliant token crowdsale.\n\nThe Swiss-based GmbH and Foundation\n\n\n\nThe ether pre-sale was conducted by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization registered in Switzerland, whose sole purpose is managing the funds raised from the ether sale in order to best serve the ethereum ecosystem.\n\nTo enable US citizens to purchase Ether without being ruled by the SEC, they framed the pre-sale of user tokens as the sale of cryptographic fuel – ether (""ETH"") – required to run distributed applications on the Ethereum open source platform.\n\nThe initial development of the software was carried out by Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, a Swiss-based LLC.\n\nThe Singapore company and DAO\n\n\n\nIn the case of Digix, the smart contract for the DigixDAO was written by DigixGlobal, a Singapore-based company. This company is then hired by the DigixDAO and gets paid for developing the Digix network. Equity tokens sold represent shares of the DigixDAO.\n\nWhile the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) does not consider tokens as securities, the legal sale to US citizens depends on the SEC\'s interpretation of the tokens under the Howey test.\n\nThe \'CODE\'\n\n\n\nA third experimental approach used by Singular-DTV – a blockchain entertainment studio – is the ""centrally organized distributed entity"".\n\nThe ‘CODE’ is a combination of a centrally organized (CO) governance component in the form of a Swiss GmbH – LLC – and a decentralized entity (DE) component in the form of a tokenized ecosystem built on ethereum.\n\nIn this case, the GmbH is responsible for spending the ether collected in the Decentralized Entity token sale to build media projects and collect the revenue generated. The ‘CODE’ is supposed to be regulatory and tax compliant, protecting the token holders from potential liability.\n\nThe independent company\n\nThe last approach is to keep the network and issuance of tokens independent from its creator.\n\nTokens are allocated via a computer algorithm that does not specify any specific public keys to receive funds. Following the Nakamoto business model, the network creator secures its share of tokens by being the first miner in the public network. Steemit did this as a Delaware C Corp.\n\nThe formation of these entities are some of the first approaches tried to legally connect the new model for building companies to the legacy world.\n\nAs more companies, lawyers and regulators enter the space, we’ll see how they develop.\n\nOverall, we see 40-plus companies applying the token-based model to finance protocol development. We believe it could be extended to other types of companies as well.\n\nRed tokens image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles. As such, the opinions expressed in this article are the author\'s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nFor more details on how you can submit an opinion or analysis article, view our Editorial Collaboration Guide or email news@coindesk.com.', 'Blockchain development start-up BlockPay is creating tools to “supercharge” merchant sales but that also recognizes that private transactions fundamentally have to form part of any credible business approach. This ‘free’ blockchain Point of Sale (POS) system is being expanded by an imminent crowdfund that will push its digital currencies platform to new levels.\n\nBlockPay, which is based in Munich, enables merchants to accept one or more digital currencies at zero cost. This includes currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, Smartcoins, EUR, USD and Chinese Yuan (CNY), risk-free online or at physical locations such as grocery chains and even vending machines. It is an Android app for tablets and mobile phones that can be easily be downloaded and claimed to be the first application that can accept multiple digital currencies all in one application.\n\nMerchants receive payment in their local currency, which ensures their protection of value without having to worry about chargebacks, rolling reserves or fraud when accepting payment. The system touts robust privacy.\n\nBut let’s step back for just one minute. Bitcoin, for example, has a transparent and immutable distributed ledger, but which is a double-edged sword. On the one hand it allows for clarity and accountability, which is a great tool for fighting fraud and corruption. On the other, it is a problem for many would-be users - corporate or otherwise.\n\nFit For Purpose?\n\nEvery transaction can be traced from one address to another, right back to its original account. Accidentally leak a little information about one of those addresses and one could reveal a string of user account names in the supply chain, seeing who is spending what.\n\nIndeed, there are now companies such as Elliptic, which analyses the Bitcoin blockchain and helps crypto exchanges monitor transactions, to trace transactions that seek to hide their criminal origins or to conceal the illegal that they are put. For criminals and legitimate businesses alike, the blockchain’s transparency could pose a real problem.\n\nAnd, the reason is not hard to fathom. If you can figure out where the money is going, you can gain a major competitive edge over a company, who their suppliers are and how much they are paying them, who they consult with, their customers, employees, management team, etc. The perfect recipe for industrial espionage you might think.\n\nIt is also one of the reasons why blockchain tech has not yet caught on in the business world. There are other reasons too - security, network effect and volatility to name three. But this is one of the numerous bumps along the road to the inevitable mainstream adoption of crypto.\n\nEnter BlockPay\n\nSo given this backdrop it is perhaps not surprising that this is one of the issues that startup BlockPay, which gained basic funding for the project around six months ago, have addressed, along with creating more standard Point Of Sale merchant tools.\n\nThe foundation work to BlockPay products’ development has largely been driven by the Bitshares community and effectively BitShares Munich, which is headed up by CEO Christoph Hering, CMO Rodrigo Crespo and Ken Code, the Development Team Lead.\n\nIn order to add the new stealth options to BlockPay products, they are holding a crowdfund to raise the required capital, which is estimated at around $850,000 according to Ronny Boesing, CEO and founder of Danish crypto exchange CCEDK ApS (CCEDK). This latest funding forms part of the exchange’s strategy in financing four so-called Initial Coin Offerings (ICO’s) per month going forward.\n\nIn basic terms an ICO is a way of obtaining funding for start-ups, which US-educated Boesing in Denmark wants to help in “bootstrapping”, and provide a route for investors to participate as well. Relating to BlockPay, its ‘pre-ICO’ is scheduled to take place 23 August before a larger ICO that is expected to occur in 2017. (The ‘Level 1’ offer to initial investors actually commenced on Saturday, 20 August).\n\nPay Easily, Quickly & Cheaply\n\nBlockPay’s offering consists of several parts that are combined into a free, downloadable Standalone app for merchants, as well as an available BlockPay Integrated system for merchants with existing e-Commerce or POS systems such as Odoo, an open source ERP system for small and big enterprises, SAP, grocery chains, gas stations, vending machines and kiosks and so on.\n\nNot only available in over forty languages and counting, over 50,000 business that currently use Odoo are able to download the free BlockPay module and start to accept digital payments for free. Creating a Merchant account is free and a swift process to complete.\n\nEcho App: Multi Currency, Multi-Asset\n\nThe next element is a multi-currency, multi-asset wallet in the form of the Echo app that allows customers to pay in any one of a dozen or more popular cryptocurrencies - Bitshares’ Smartcoins, Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum and Steem amongst others.\n\nThe second element is that all BlockPay systems already work with all existing crypto mobile wallets such as Jaxx, Mycelium, Circle and Dash wallet. The merchant, who pays no fee to utilize BlockPay, provides the amount due, and the customer pays either via a QR code or by NFC, simply tapping their phone on the terminal. Fast and easy, it is painless for both sides.\n\nFurthermore, BlockPay enables merchants to accept one or more global digital currencies at zero cost, with several added benefits. Being crypto, there are no chargebacks, no possibilities of ID theft and it is faster and safer than cash.\n\nNo Bank Or Payment Processing\n\nPayments are peer-to-peer, so there is no bank or payment processing company to just automatically reverse them if the customer complains. This is a perennial issue for many online merchants, especially when it is the policy of the payments company to side with the customer by default - many find themselves out of pocket.\n\nAnd, whilst credit card payments might take a couple of days to show up in a merchant’s account and be subject to monthly and 2%-3% fees, digital currencies take just seconds to confirm and be deposited to the merchants secure blockchain account.\n\nThe customer covers the network fee which is typically under 4 cents. So this is very encouraging for users of digital currencies as well. Now one can travel anywhere in the world and never worry about which currency you will have to use.\n\nAll of this is really just entry level stuff for a technology that wants to compete with existing payments systems. But it is a mark of how young digital cash is that these kinds of apps - with interfaces slick and simple enough to be as user friendly as a credit card - are only just starting to emerge.\n\nTransact Anonymously, Talk Privately\n\nThen there is the privacy side of things. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general may have a reputation for anonymity, but many might say it is more like pseudonymity (i.e. a state of disguised identity).\n\nThe transparency of the blockchain means you can see exactly where money is going: you know the addresses, even if you do not immediately know who the addresses belong to. But that is something that can often be gleaned with patience and the right approach, especially if the owners have been careless.\n\nClearly, that is unacceptable for most businesses as well as most regular users too. Now various approaches have arisen to address Bitcoin’s transparency in the interests of financial privacy. Several ‘altcoins’ offer anonymity features that - one way or another - aim to obscure transactions to prevent them from being tracked.\n\nAs yet though, none has shown itself to be superior to the competition. In fact, we do not yet know the lengths to which organizations will go in order to unscramble transactions to gain the information they want. What proves robust against casual snoopers might be a cinch for the NSA to untangle.\n\nEcho Wallet\n\nThe Echo wallet combines what is claimed to be Bitshares’ Stealth crypto transactions with secure voice, video and messaging. Chat and media messages are not only encrypted, but can be self-destructing, similar to Snapchat.\n\nHering, BlockPay’s co-founder and CEO based in Munich, commenting about the significance of such an approach says: “It solves two major problems of our time, namely privacy and financial freedom. Firstly, Echo protects your personal chat, video and voice messages against hackers and censorship. And, secondly Echo gives you the choice to manage multiple currencies at your fingertips.”\n\nTransferring funds takes 3 seconds or less. And, thanks to modern blockchain technologies Echo users can register their desired username on the blockchain with a few simple taps.\n\nHering, an ideologue who studied at the Munich Business School in the Bavarian capital created the app not just for business purposes, but because he regards our free communication and financial privacy as being “placed increasingly at risk.”\n\nEvidently, we are entering a Brave New World of Internet commerce, where the blockchain is leveraged to its fullest to offer a range of benefits including speed, security, cost and privacy. The final irony is that those who pioneered Bitcoin e-commerce on the dark web do not seem so interested in these new developments. BlockPay will soon be available in the Android App stores as yet another free app from BitShares Munich.\n\nPre-ICO Investment\n\nThe pre-ICO to crowdfund the BlockPay project commences on August 23, 2016 at noon in co-operation with the decentralized exchange platform OpenLedger, its economic enterprise engine ICOO (Initial Coin Offering OpenLedger) and CCEDK.\n\nThe latter will provide escrow services for the ICO, as well as issuing the asset and distributing the related BlockPay tokens at the end of the ICO. The ICOO is effectively the ICO of ICO’s and is (1) a crypto token of its own issued and tradable via CCDEK/OpenLedger, and (2) A crowdfunding ‘3.0 model’ that makes it possible for businesses to leverage the platform and ecosystem in order to host an ICO.\n\nCCEDK has an ordering module to allow interested parties to buy the tokens, with two options to purchase either via the ICO page on BlockPay.ch or the ICO Live button at CCEDK.com. Once the 5 million BlockPay tokens set aside for crowdfund have been sold the ICO ends.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Recent months have seen blockchain innovation professionals departing legacy financial institutions for smaller startups, but the motivations driving this shift in the industry are less than clear.\n\nTo date, it’s been one of the less-discussed trends of 2016, given the lack of public dialogue from the major firms affected and the relative quiet of the new startup founders, many of whom are seeking to do business with their former employers.\n\nSo far in 2016, BNP Paribas, Deloitte, JPMorgan and State Street have all seen members of their blockchain teams depart. This has given rise to a new wave of lesser-known startups including firms like DPactum, Kadena and Nuco. Still others, like the founder and head of Philips Blockchain Lab, have left without specifying why.\n\nIn interviews, representatives of these startups say the departures are more about bringing their enterprise blockchain insights to a wider group of industries. Rather than the result of any cutbacks in spending at major backs, this new generation of founders believes it will be easier to raise more capital, more quickly, outside the firm.\n\nFor Stuart Popejoy, who left JPMorgan’s blockchain project in July to found financial services-focused private blockchain startup Kadena, it’s about opportunity and demand.\n\nPopejoy told CoinDesk:\n\n""Our work at JPMorgan established that a scalable blockchain was possible, but somebody still had to push it out to the industry. After all, blockchains are inherently inter-organizational, whereas JPMorgan’s priorities will be to solve problems in the bank.""\n\nBut, Popejoy didn’t go alone, as his fellow JPMorgan colleague, developer Will Martino, also made the move to Kadena. The two ex-bank execs want to bring the technology to the broader market, and in their eyes, it’s still early enough to make headway.\n\nEven the high-profile enterprise blockchain groups are having trouble answering basic technical questions – scalability, transaction privacy and the safety of smart contracts – about how blockchain can be implemented, he said.\n\n“When we were at the bank, we simply couldn\'t find a vendor solution that could provide the necessary performance our use cases demanded without sacrificing the robustness and simplicity of a true blockchain, which is why we ‘rolled our own\',” Popejoy said.\n\nNatural progression\n\nOther former finance executives are departing for existing startups.\n\nJeremy Drane, for example, was previously head of blockchain at ‘Big Four’ accounting firm PwC before joining blockchain startup Libra as its CCO. Drane said he sees the recent run of departures as the natural progression of tech moving from experimentation to pilot phase.\n\n“What you’re seeing is the first round of projects moving ... off the innovation budgets into enterprise evaluation cycles where the processes are more rigid,” Drane said. “There’s a totally different set of rules around how those projects are managed and what flexibility you have.”\n\nThis maturation is another possible reason that members of blockchain teams at legacy institutions are moving on, but industry analysts also spoke to its “sex appeal”.\n\nFor professionals that are geared towards innovation, moving into production is less appealing. Instead, they’ll take what they learned and build startups that bring the tech to more industries.\n\n“There are probably push-and-pull factors for joining startups. The potential upside is larger in the entrepreneurial space than in managing a team in a large organization,” said Antony Lewis, an independent blockchain consultant.\n\nWhile there seems to be enough blockchain startups to go around, most of these companies operate in the financial services space. Legacy companies in other industries will need help adopting the technology for their business models. Consumer product companies, entertainment and media businesses, as well as humanitarian and international aid projects, are a few of the industries currently showing interest in blockchain.\n\nChris Larsen, founder and CEO of Ripple, said this movement signals that blockchain optimism is still on the rise for both banks and startups.\n\n“If anything, I’d say it’s an indication that thing are getting stronger and that [the professionals] see things booming and want to put themselves where the action is,” Larsen said.\n\nUncertainty Remains\n\nOthers have demonstrated more skepticism.\n\nGideon Greenspan, founder and CEO of blockchain tech specialist Coin Sciences, sees the market for private blockchain solutions contracting. For example, he said that concerns about confidentiality have shaken the faith in use cases such as clearing and settlement that had previously been earmarked for R&D budgets.\n\n“Much of banks\' early investments in blockchains were based on this expected use case, rather than more general ideas of shared data storage (for which blockchains are well suited). In that case it would make sense for them cut back on spending in the area,” he said.\n\nHowever, Greenspan indicated that he hasn’t seen a slowdown in the use of Coin Science’s Multichain platform for big bank pilot programs. So far, he said, Multichain has been used to create a crowdfunding platform, a regulator overview and a shared documentation notarization service.\n\nOne reason banks may be pulling back on external equity investment and partnerships with startups could be the overabundance of blockchain startups in the market.\n\n“Banks could be waiting to see which platforms become dominant before developing a project on any particular platform,” Greenspan said.\n\nMany banks, analysts said, simply don’t have the manpower to filter through and vet all these various startups.\n\nFor now, it seems the industry will remain stuck in the awkward positioning of its hype cycle. While many are heralding 2017 as the “Year of the Blockchain”, it’s likely that this claim will be valid for years to come.\n\nLibra’s Drane concluded:\n\n“I can understand the skepticism, but these systems take a long time to build.”\n\nEvolution image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', ""Released this year the TV movie documentary ‘Down the Deep, Dark Web’ (2016) puts darknet residents - hackers, cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists - in the spotlight, and lets them “guide us ever deeper down this rabbit hole, uncovering the hidden light at the bottom of the deep dark web”.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to the writer and associate producer of the movie Yuval Orr about Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, privacy, crypto-anarchy and other issues related to the ‘Deep, Dark Web.’\n\nRoss Ulbricht - revolutionary or crazy?\n\nYuval Orr notes they have never spoken to Ross Ulbricht when working on the movie. However, they have been in conversation with those who have supported his case and called into question its fairness.\n\nOrr says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“The case itself is mired in intrigue, as such that between the US investigators who were embezzling funds from the site even as they were tasked with taking it down, the alleged hits ordered by Ulbricht, and the extra-legal means the US government are likely to have used to track down the site's servers. It's quite impossible to make heads or tails of it all.”\n\nThus, trying to approach the story of the Silk Road, they wanted to look at the case from the perspective of the crypto-anarchists who have largely thrown their support behind Ulbricht.\n\nOrr explains:\n\n“Their argument is, yes, the Silk Road was a market for illegal goods and services, but the proof of concept is more important than the market itself. That is, if the most extreme example of an online market is viable - a market largely designed to sell drugs - then what's to stop us from creating markets for ordinary, everyday goods?”\n\nThe creators of the movie don't come down on one side or the other regarding Ross Ulbricht. According to Orr, it would be presumptuous to call him either revolutionary or crazy without ever having met him or spoken with him.\n\nHowever, he notes:\n\n“What's clear though, is that he has had this effect of making a fairly revolutionary concept seem possible when applied to legal goods and services that we all consume on a regular basis. The real question, then, is what comes next.”\n\nBitcoin and cinema\n\nA few months ago I wrote an essay about Cinema and Bitcoin which aimed at demonstrating that movies reflect people’s attention to specific subjects, as in in the Bitcoin case.\n\nThe movie industry takes care of a topic when it becomes popular. This way, from 2012 - when Bitcoin began to be famous - more films and documentaries related to the cryptocurrency started to appear. The same thing is happening with the Deep Web, or the “virtual Sodom and Gomorrah.” After the Silk Road and Ross Ulbricht case, this hidden part of the web became more popular than ever, and cinema started to gain an interest in telling its own story about the deep, dark web.\n\nSince 2014 there have been several good documentaries about this topic: Inside the ‘Dark Web,’ ‘Deep Web’ and now we have a new one: ‘Down the Deep, Dark Web’ by Yval Orr, who Cointelegraph had the pleasure to talk with.\n\nHe explains how the movie came together:\n\n“The idea for ‘Down the Deep, Dark Web’ started in conversation with Itai Landsberg, head of documentaries at Israel's public broadcaster, after he read about the Darknet markets where hackers were selling stolen credit card numbers. [...]. It was only once we started to delve deeper into the topic that we realized that as scandalizing as some of these markets and similar topics were, there were much more interesting philosophical and political questions which emerge once you start to peel back the layers and understand the ideological underpinnings of what has been dubbed the darknet.”\n\nPolitical interpretation of the Deep Web\n\n‘Down the Deep Dark Web,’ in fact, is not a simple documentary, as it tries not only to narrate how the deep web works, but it also opens up philosophical and political interpretations of the Deep Web functions. And maybe we should call it Deep Web, as the “dark” adjective may be misleading because “technology has always had two-sides and it depends how you use it” explained Orr during the movie.\n\nHe says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Our original goal was to familiarize audiences with the dark net markets for the first time. But as the production progressed we made a really critical switch to focus more on the crypto-anarchists and cypherpunks and to bring their work and words to light and expose audiences to it. So the goal became to engage in a kind of public conversation with these groups whose work has been somewhat hidden from view and to draw in as many people as possible to that conversation.”\n\nOrr’s documentary gives viewers the chance to ask themselves important questions related to the compromises people need to accept in exchange for security, as individual freedoms are often compromised against the control of terrorists and criminals.\n\nAirports, shopping malls and several other private and public places are full of cameras to track traffic and order, but have you ever thought that we are always filmed and controlled as in George Orwell’s book ‘1984?’\n\nOrr concludes:""]"
08/21/2016,"['The cryptocurrency has a volatile past, but is now being traded around the world. Here’s the lowdown on going digital with your money\n\nLooking at the negligible returns offered on cash investments, Edward Cunningham started searching for alternatives. Instead of going to the stock market or buying up gold bars, however, the 45-year-old from Sherborne in Dorset turned to the internet, and last September invested in the digital currency bitcoin. Since then his stake has more than doubled.\n\nBitcoin is a paperless, bankless, stateless currency which exists on computers, and carries with it a whiff of peril for investors. Cunningham admits to being nervous when he first signed up to trade in the currency, especially when he had to make his first deposit via a bank in Estonia. “It all turned out well and I bought my first coins for $225 each, well below today’s price of around $575,” he says.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has fluctuated wildly since it was launched in 2009. Six years ago, two pizzas were bought for 10,000 bitcoin. By 2013, each bitcoin peaked in value at $1,000.\n\nCoupled with these enormous peaks and troughs have been hacking controversies. Earlier this month almost 120,000 bitcoin, worth around $78m, were stolen from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, causing a 20% drop in the value of the currency.\n\nInvestor Edward Cunningham is confident in his bitcoin holdings\n\nDespite such drops Cunningham is ahead on his investment and feels positive about the currency, which is now being used for payment by companies such as Tesla and Microsoft, and is confident his investment will grow further. So, is it time for others to follow his cryptocurrency lead?\n\nWhat exactly is bitcoin?\n\nStarted by a small group of hackers, bitcoin is unlike traditional currencies in that it has no central bank, nation state or regulatory authority backing it up.\n\nThe coins themselves are made by computers solving a set of complex maths problems, and people who use their computers to make coins and record transactions are called miners.\n\nTo spend it, users buy bitcoin and transact using exchanges such as San Francisco-based Coinbase. Rather than a central authority validating transactions, they are all recorded on a public ledger, called the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin has a finite supply of 21m of which more than 15m are in circulation, which supporters claim make it more stable than government-backed currencies that can be devalued by central banks printing money. They say this means its value will only rise over time, with some claiming the price could top $10,000 a coin. Bitcoin first came to the attention of many people after it was used on the online black market site Silk Road, known as a platform for selling illegal drugs.\n\n“The coins are ‘manufactured’ using cryptography, which is spooky to most people. Bitcoin is also a reasonably anonymous way to carry out large cross-border money transfers, so has inevitably become linked to illegal goods and services,” says Dave Hrycyszyn, of digital agency Head, which advises companies on new technologies.\n\nThe lack of regulation appeals to some, but also means it has none of the stability mechanisms typically associated with a currency, which can make it volatile, he said.\n\nYou can pay using a bitcoin wallet app, and can even get a bitcoin debit card Obi Nwosu, Coinfloor\n\nHow do I buy it?\n\nBitcoin is bought via online exchanges and platforms, with an increasing number of UK options. Fractions or “bits” can be bought instead of a whole bitcoin. Investment can start with as little as $10 on some sites. Bitcoin exchanges and brokers include Coinfloor, CoinCorner and QuickBitcoin. Transaction fees vary according to the exchange or broker, but typically range from 0.2%-1% of the currency bought, plus bank transaction charges. Fees of up to 1% can apply on sales.\n\nBitcoin are stored in a “digital wallet”, which can also manage transactions. It exists either in the cloud or on computers, and can be linked to bank accounts. If using an online wallet , investors must be sure they can trust the provider, because if hackers breach its server’s security measures the bitcoin could be stolen.\n\nTypically, you can pay by bank transfer, mobile payments or with a Visa or Mastercard. There are also bitcoin ATMs, which allow for bitcoin to be exchanged for cash and vice versa, in London, Bristol, Brighton and Glasgow.\n\nWhat can you buy with it?\n\nA growing list of firms accept Bitcoin, including Tesla, Microsoft, CheapAir.com and Britain’s first bitcoin pub, The Pembury Tavern in Hackney, London, where a pint of Milton Pegasus costs £3.70 or 0.0084 bitcoin.\n\nObi Nwosu, managing director of Coinfloor, says you can spend it wherever you see the “bitcoin accepted here” sign, either online or at local stores, with no transaction charges. “You can pay using a bitcoin wallet app, and can even get bitcoin debit cards that you can use anywhere that accepts Mastercard or Visa.”\n\nYou can also cash in your coins at any time and get real currency in return, for a small broker fee, he adds.\n\nShould I invest in it?\n\nBitcoin has grown strongly but with plenty of volatility along the way. Over the past 12 months its price has risen from $220 to $575, according to figures from Coindesk – a return of 161%. It has also shown resilience, with the price rallying after the Bitfinex hack. Yet it remains well below its all-time spike of $979.45, which it hit on 25 November 2013. In short, this is not a safe haven: despite excitable claims the price could hit $10,000, where it goes next is anybody’s guess, so investors should approach with caution.\n\nLex Deak, chief executive of alternative investment aggregator Off3r, says investing in Bitcoin isn’t for the fainthearted. “You should only invest a small proportion of your money and be prepared for massive swings in value.”\n\nBitcoin worth $78m stolen from Bitfinex exchange in Hong Kong Read more\n\nThe early gold rush days are over, he adds, and buyers shouldn’t treat it as a get-rich-quick scheme. “You could double your money within a year, but you could easily lose it all,” he says.\n\nMarc Warne, the founder of Bittylicious, a site where bitcoins can be bought, says novice investors should start modestly. “Just buy a small amount to begin with, say £30, to learn how it works, how to trade it, and how to handle it safely in a wallet,” he says. He advises against investing large sums unless you really understand crypto currencies and computer security.\n\nAs bitcoin has a finite supply, future price movement will depend on demand, Warne says. “Bitcoin will be used more in the future because it’s the first time that something not fully controlled by any entity like a government or bank has been used over the internet. It has been around for about seven years now without any fundamental issues.”\n\nIs it safe?\n\nBitcoin cannot be hacked, manipulated or altered, but exchanges or digital wallets are vulnerable, just like online bank accounts, Warne says. “If you hold bitcoin in any form you instantly become a target,” he adds.\n\nSince bitcoin doesn’t actually exist, what is stored in the wallet are the secure digital keys used to access specific details of the bitcoin. The private key is a secret code which allows the user to prove ownership of their bitcoin. Wallets can be installed on smartphones using an app or web-based wallets can be run by currency exchanges. Buyers need to make sure their computer’s security is up to scratch, and must also trust the exchange, which needs high-level security to prevent hacking.\n\nJames Hill, software developer at consultancy Scott Logic, says the core blockchain algorithm, which underpins all cryptocurrencies, remains secure. He says the real danger comes from losing the keys that prove buyers own their own coins.\n\nAll Bitfinex clients to share 36% loss of assets following exchange hack Read more\n\nIf you are hacked, there is no way of claiming a refund from a bank or regulatory authority because none exists.\n\nWord of warning\n\nHrycyszyn warns that, as with all technology, something better may one day come along. “When that happens, bitcoin’s value could collapse to near-zero, probably in a matter of hours or minutes, in a spectacular ball of flames. It has no support structure to prop it up, like a normal currency does. Do not treat this as a long-term store of value to fund your retirement.”\n\nDamien Fahy, founder of website MoneytotheMasses, says it will remain a fringe investment until it is officially recognised and regulated. “Ordinary currency investing is risky enough, but bitcoin is even riskier.”\n\nBUYING AND SELLING\n\n■ Step 1 Set up a bitcoin wallet. You need somewhere to store the private keys that allow you to spend or exchange bitcoin. Security is vital, so check how your money is protected – otherwise you could lose all of it. Otherwise, this is similar to opening an ordinary bank account.\n\n■ Step 2 Get your bitcoin address. Once you have signed up and accepted the user agreement you will get a bitcoin address, a unique identifier of 26-35 numbers and letters, beginning with the number 1 or 3, which is the destination for a bitcoin payment.\n\n■ Step 3 Buy bitcoin. You can make your purchase through your wallet or a range of brokers and platforms. These are digital rather than physical coins. Input your bitcoin address, the amount of money you want to convert, how you plan to pay, and so on. You typically have to pay a fee of between 0.2% and 1%, depending on the site, plus a small bank transfer fee.\n\n■ Step 4 Make a payment. Once you have bitcoin in your account you can start making payments. You will need the bitcoin address of the recipient.\n\n■ Step 5 Sell bitcoin. If you want to cash in your bitcoin, or bank a profit, selling is pretty straightforward. You can register to sell direct on sites through an online exchange or platforms such as Coinbase, Coinfloor, BitBargain or Bittylicious. Again, there are transaction fees up to about 1% of your trade.', ""In the race to adopt Blockchain technology and cut costs, financial firms have to deal with multiple challenges. Japanese financial firms have been hit by the most basic of them of all – a shortage of technical experts.\n\nJapan – regulation a positive\n\nThe Japanese government has been active in regulating cryptocurrency-based companies. A new law has been passed regulating Bitcoin exchanges, after the Mt Gox debacle. The Japanese Government passed a bill in May 2016, which recognized that virtual currencies have a function similar to money. Japan has also eased regulations, now allowing banks to invest in fintech firms, which is expected to help emerging fintech firms raise capital.\n\nShortage of experts\n\nReuters has reported that a shortage of Blockchain experts is hindering Japanese financial firms in adopting Blockchain technology. With few fintech startups in Japan, the number of Blockchain experts whose skills have been honed in cutting-edge technology is low. This situation is expected to persist, as these skill sets can only be developed over a period of time.\n\nLanguage a barrier\n\nUnlike English-speaking countries, Japan cannot depend on a quick import of foreign talent to meet its shortages. Japan is not an immigration-friendly country, unlike the US or Canada. The government has a points-based system for allowing highly skilled and educated workers the right to work in Japan. However, there is a language barrier which may prevent people who have no knowledge of Japanese from working with Japanese firms.\n\nCollaboration way forward\n\nWhile there may be a shortage of Blockchain experts, it hasn't stopped Japanese Banks from collaborating with foreign partners like Ripple to fully leverage new technologies. A consortium of 15 banks, including the Bank of Yokohama and SBI Sumishin Net Bank have come together to study the use of Blockchain technology in payment transfers. Through the use of a settlement system developed by Ripple, they plan to cut transfer costs to a tenth of existing levels. Adoption of Blockchain technology in Japan is expected to progress, even if through the collaborative route."", ""The ransom letter sent to the administrators of infected hosts\n\nIt seems like we have had to report on some major new hack or threat every week as of late. Black-Hat Hackers are becoming more sophisticated, while their wares are becoming more diverse and complicated. One of the latest pieces of malware, the nasty Rex Linux Trojan, packs in DDoS attacks, ransomware , and a Bitcoin miner.Stu Gorton, CEO and Co-Founder of Forkbombus Labs, disclosed a new kind of ransomware that targeted Drupal websites this past May in an interview with Softpedia. It was not particularly effective and could easily be defeated. This particular ransomware has evolved in the last three months, however, and now is far more dangerous.The malware is developed in Go, Google’s homegrown programming language, and uses P2P to communicate. Rex is composed of five different parts-- an attack vector, bitcoin mining, C&C Communication, ransomware, and DDoS.How does the attack vector work? Bots scan the Internet for vulnerable Drupal, Wordpress , and Magento websites and then drop the Rex malware onto the server. The Trojan uses the documented CVE-2014-3704 Drupalgeddon vulnerability to infect Drupal sites, Shoplift RCE bugs to target Magento websites, and security vulnerabilities in plugins such as WooCommerce, Robo Gallery, Rev Slider, WP-squirrel, Site Import, Brandfolder, Issuu Panel, and Gwolle Guestbook to infect Wordpress websites.This ransomware uses the Kademlia P2P network on port 5099 with TLS enabled in order to communicate. The Trojan can also mine for crypto-currency, such as Bitcoin, on infected hosts. The Bitcoin miner portion also appears to be used in the DDoS attacks.The ransomware known as “RansomScanner” is used to retrieve administrator contacts of the infected website, and send a DDoS threat via email. The hackers threaten to DDoS the server unless a ransom fee is paid in Bitcoin. No one is known to have been DDoS’d yet, however.Popular anti-virus engine VirusTotal does not currently recognize the Trojan as a threat. If you are a website administrator, it's recommended to not leave out of date services Internet-facing in order to limit exposure."", 'Caroline Binham and Madhumita Murgia in London AUGUST 21, 2016 0 UK consumers are one step closer to using products underpinned by blockchain technology after the financial watchdog said it was considering approving a “small but significant number of firms” using the process behind bitcoin, the cryptocurrency. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, considered by the fintech industry as among the most forward-thinking regulators in the world, said that several groups in its preapproval stage are developing consumer-facing and compliance products that use blockchain technology. Blockchain’s attraction for banks is it provides a unique shared database across multiple locations as an immutable public ledger of transactions, offering the potential to cut costs and speed up areas such as settlement of securities trades. However, some regulators have been wary of the technology, warning of its potential vulnerability to fraud or to undermining financial stability. “We do think [blockchain] has got some potentially interesting applications and we are talking to firms thinking about how to apply that to financial services and how it could benefit consumers or indeed make the business of compliance easier,” said Chris Woolard, the FCA’s director of strategy and competition, in an interview with the Financial Times. “There may be areas where we might want to encourage it a bit.” The companies in question are being scrutinised as part of the FCA’s so-called Project Innovate. This offers advice to companies — either start-ups or incumbents — trying to develop cutting-edge products on what regulations they need to adhere to. In its first year, the project assessed 177 companies and approved 40 of them. It includes a so-called regulatory sandbox, where companies can test products with temporary FCA authorisation. Mr Woolard said that a “small but significant number” developing blockchain technology are part of the project, adding the FCA would announce more details in the coming months. If a company wants to start lending or undertake any kind of payment services in the UK it would need FCA approval. If the FCA did give its imprimatur the companies would be among the first in the world to gain regulatory approval. Today, the number of blockchain-enabled products in commercial use is “close to zero”, said Nick Williamson, chief executive of London-based blockchain start-up, Credits, because the technology is still being tested. Related article Bitcoin hype leads more to ask: what is blockchain? Finance executives are flocking to courses that cover digital currencies San Francisco-based blockchain payments company Ripple, is one of the handful that is integrating its platform with banks. This summer, it partnered with Japan’s Mizuho Financial Group, and Santander in the UK, the first banks in their respective countries to pilot blockchain technology for cross-currency settlement and cross-border payments. Currently, financial services make up over half of the global blockchain market, according to Jeremy Millar, founder of Ledger Partners, an advisory firm focusing on blockchain. A recent estimate from Greenwich Associates said that financial institutions will spend more than $1bn on blockchain in 2016. “Reports have claimed up to $100bn could be saved on the post-trade settlement process by using blockchain. Another estimate by Goldman Sachs said there could be $50bn of savings in the US repo market alone. The numbers are huge,” Mr Millar said. The UK government has stressed the need for new companies to challenge incumbents, particularly in financial services, and policymakers and regulators have followed suit. The UK is seen by the industry as having the most fintech-friendly regime worldwide, according to a global survey by consultants EY.', 'Alex Millar is a blogger, podcaster and YouTube publisher, with a degree in Engineering Physics from Queen\'s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Millar expounds his theory that money is energy, arguing that bitcoin provides a superior alternative to fiat currencies from a purely scientific perspective.\n\nIn physics, the definition of ""energy"" is ""that which allows work to be done.""\n\nThis means that money is energy, since it can be used to do work via payments to people. The energy in money can be thought of as ""economic energy"". Economists call economic energy ""price"" and measure it in terms of ""euros"" or ""Kenyan shillings"" and so on.\n\nBut, these units are abstract because their quantity changes over time. Physicists would prefer to use units such as joules or kilowatt-hours, which have a concrete basis in physical realities of mass (kg), length (m), and time (s).\n\nSince money is energy we can apply the Law of Conservation of Energy, which says: ""Energy cannot be created or destroyed, merely transformed.”\n\nYou might remember examples of this law from high school science: a toaster transforms electrical energy into thermal energy; a blender transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy.\n\nA $100 bill has significant economic energy. And yet, it was created in an automated process using inexpensive raw materials and an insignificant amount of electrical energy. This invites the question: from where did the economic energy in a $100 bill come from?\n\nThe answer lies in economics 101, which says that price (economic energy) is a function of supply and demand.\n\nAs the overall supply of a commodity increases, the energy of each unit decreases. Therefore, the energy contained in a new $100 bill was transformed from pre-existing dollars, each of which lost a tiny fraction of its energy. Power is a zero-sum game.\n\nThis realization has ramifications for traditional monies such as dollars, proof-of-stake (PoS) monies such as those planned for future versions of ethereum, and proof-of-work (PoW) monies such as bitcoin.\n\nDollars, euros, etc\n\nAs explained above, when authorities create new dollars, they take energy from holders of pre-existing dollars.\n\nThe energy equation is simple:\n\nProof-of-stake coins\n\nLet’s assume a future ethereum is a PoS network that awards new coins to ether holders in proportion to their holdings.\n\nIn other words, everyone holding X coins will have Cx coins after the next coin reward, (where C is some constant). Energy is transformed from old coins to new coins, which are held by the same people.\n\nWithout a flow of energy it is difficult to see the point of creating new coins in a PoS system. Supposedly the purpose is to find consensus on the growth of a blockchain. This remains to be seen.\n\nProof-of-work coins\n\nThe creation process of PoW coins (like bitcoin) consumes large amounts of electrical energy.\n\nBitcoin fans might be tempted to assume that this energy is completely transformed into economic energy of new coins and that, therefore, pre-existing coins do not lose energy.\n\nHowever, the mining process also creates heat. If the energy in the heat is equal to the electrical energy consumed, then the energy in new coins must come from pre-existing coins. Fortunately, this seems unlikely, since machines tend not to be used if energy input is completely lost to heat.\n\nIt seems much more likely that economic energy is transformed from electrical energy with some efficiency loss to heat.\n\nSummary\n\nWhereas those who store energy in dollars have energy syphoned by economic parasites, those who store energy in bitcoin do not.\n\nBitcoin miners have found a way to convert electrical energy into economic energy.\n\nAs logical people realize that they can store pure economic energy without the drawback of hosting an economic parasite, they will sell their dollars for bitcoin. This will result in a conversion of energy from dollars to bitcoin.\n\nIt will also create a positive feedback loop: even people who cannot see the logic of holding a parasite-resistant money will see the economic energy (price) of bitcoin rise due to rising demand.\n\nLater, as the total economic energy in bitcoin approaches that of dollars, people will notice the economic energy of dollars fall due to falling demand. Like a chemical reaction, energy will then transform quickly, and nearly completely (I say ""nearly completely"" because some people will refuse to stop believing in dollars).\n\nFinally, from a physicist’s perspective, there is an inevitable trend in the universe for entropy (disorder) to increase.\n\nSince PoW coins like bitcoin are the only money that contributes to increasing entropy through heat loss in mining, they are the only money that has a purpose from a universal perspective.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Medium and has been republished here with the author\'s permission.\n\nNewton\'s cradle via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Through the Xsolla network, users were able to support their favorite gamers and streamers using Bitcoin, which required substantially small transaction fees and processing time compared to traditional forms of payments.\n\nHowever, as the Xsolla development team eliminated Bitcoin from its payment network, Twitch users were disallowed from using Bitcoin. The removal of Bitcoin payments infuriated many gamers and users on the network, especially the users of the Twitch platform who had no access to conventional forms of payments such as credit and debit cards.\n\nNormal address deposits enabled\n\nFor the past 24 months, both the gaming and Bitcoin communities pressured Twitch integrate Bitcoin payments to help gamers and streamers better monetize their digital content. In contempt of the requests from the two communities, it was more difficult for Twitch to execute such integration due to their involvement with Amazon, which now serves as its parent company.\n\nAt last, Twitch reintegrated Bitcoin payments back into their system on August 21 through Coinbase. More interestingly, the platform has also enabled normal address deposits, allowing users to send Bitcoin transactions directly from their wallet to the Twitch platform without dealing with third-party payment platforms and processors.\n\nBitcoin integration for other Amazon services\n\nAmidst the roll out of the Twitch Bitcoin payment option, users pointed out an interesting fact that an Amazon company has officially begun to offer Bitcoin as one of its payment methods. The Twitch Bitcoin integration has raised hopes for other Amazon-based services users who are awaiting for the company to integrate the digital currency in other platforms like its advertising network and e-commerce platform.\n\nThe Twitch team is yet to provide an official statement. Cointelegraph will update the story once the official announcement is made.', 'ConsenSys, a blockchain technology company, and Ethereum have developed BTC Relay, an Ethereum contract that allows Ethereum users to pay with bitcoin. Servicing as a bridge between Ethereum and bitcoin, BTC Relay is a tool for developers who want to verify bitcoin transactions for Ethereum and smart contract applications.\n\nCommunity members, called Relayers, provide BTC Relay with new bitcoin block headers generated by bitcoin miners. Ethereum app developers can make API calls to BTC Relay from smart contracts to verify bitcoin network activities.\n\nAnyone can join the Ethereum network and become a Relayer. There is no hardware or electricity cost.\n\nHow It Works\n\nBTC Relay uses the block headers to build a small version of the bitcoin blockchain. The method is also used by Bitcoin Simplified Payment Verification (SPV), a scheme described in section 8 of the original bitcoin white paper.\n\nRelayers send the block headers to BTC Relay. When a transaction is verified in the block, or the header is retrieved, Relayers are rewarded a fee. The fees are sent when transactions are verified in the block or the header is retrieved. The Relayer of the header earns a fee that is usually specified when the Relayer submits the header.\n\nThe cycle of Relayers submitting headers – then applications processing bitcoin payments and rewarding Relayers with fees – enable the system to be self-sustaining and autonomous.\n\nDetails are available on GitHub (https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay/tree/master#incentives-for-relayers).\n\nAn Open Source Project\n\nConsenSys launched BTC Relay in May, describing it as an open source project allowing Ethereum-based networks to interoperate programmatically with the bitcoin network, and eventually integrating with other Ethereum and bitcoin-based systems.\n\nBTC Relay does not grant special privileges to any party, ConsenSys noted in a press release. Ethereum developers can use BTC Relay to implement a “pay with bitcoin” button in Ethereum-based decentralized applications, enabling bitcoin holders to interact with decentralized applications and smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.\n\nEtherEx, a decentralized exchange, has added BTC Relay as a mechanism for exchanging bitcoin with Ether without any counterparty risk.\n\nAnother use is issuing an Ethereum-based BTC token (ETHBTC) based on locking BTC tokens in a multisig on the bitcoin protocol, a bidirectional bridge between ETHBTC and BTC.\n\nBTC Relay was funded and conceived under the Ethereum Foundation. ConsenSys adopted and supported it when Joseph Chow, the developer of BTC Relay, joined ConsenSys. Wanxiang Blockchain Labs funded an independent security audit and rewards for a bug bounty program.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum races ahead with Raiden’s implementation of Lightning Network\n\nMore Innovation Expected\n\n“BTC Relay is a building block and I look forward to the infrastructure, applications, and innovations that BTC Relay helps enable on and off the Ethereum platform,” Chow said. “The possibilities are exciting.”\n\nVitalik Buterin, the inventor of Ethereum, said he was excited to see BTC Relay provide the first-ever production release of such cross-blockchain communication of this kind. He said he hopes to see it set an example for interoperating cross-blockchain applications, whether between Ethereum and bitcoin, other blockchains and Ethereum and public and private or consortium chains.\n\nJoseph Lubin, founder and CEO of ConsenSys, called BTC Relay a powerful tool enabling Ethereum smart contracts to serve as SPV wallets for other Ethereum-based networks or blockchain-based systems in permissioned, or open permissionless implementations.\n\nWith this capability, Ethereum, on account of the stateful, computational power of its smart contract and EVM capabilities, can serve as a substrate for many “glue” protocols that will join blockchain networks and other decentralized services into an Internet of decentralized systems.\n\nLubin said:\n\nWe envision a world of many purpose-built private enterprise and consortium blockchain systems, in addition to public blockchain networks, and BTC Relay and its extensions can enable them all to easily interoperate.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

After several conversations and meetings with virtual currency experts, consumer organizations, and others, he said he decided to remove AB 1326 from consideration for a vote this year, saying more time is needed to study the measure.\n\nThe use of virtual currency has become more prevalent statewide, he said, but as with any financial product, it carries potential risks for consumers.\n\nAB 1326 required virtual currency companies to be licensed. Since Dababneh introduced the bill last year, efforts have been made to support a forward-thinking solution containing strong consumer protections.\n\nCurrent Bill Deemed Unworthy\n\nDababneh said in a prepared statement:\n\nUnfortunately, the current bill in print does not meet the objectives to create a lasting regulatory framework that protects consumers and allows this industry to thrive in our state. More time is needed and these conversations must continue in order for California to be at the forefront of this effort.\n\nDababneh said federal regulators have issued guidance to virtual currency businesses. He noted the IRS has addressed virtual currency’s tax status while the Federal Bureau of Investigation has auctioned bitcoin seized in the Silk Road case. He said these events demonstrate digital currency’s growth and staying power.\n\nHowever, a virtual currency user currently has no protection against loss, and businesses that transmit, store and use it are functioning in an ecosystem of regulatory uncertainty, he said.\n\nPotential harm to consumers is not a remote possibility, Dababneh said, as it has already occurred. He noted the recent $65 million bitcoin hack that’s been in the news lately.\n\nWhat the Measure Needs\n\nVirtual currency businesses have a place in financial services, Dababneh said, but California has to establish minimum standards and protections.\n\n“I look forward to continuing this discussion with stakeholders in January,” he said.\n\nDababneh’s bill was awaiting a second reading by the state senate, CCN reported earlier this month.\n\nBill opponents claimed its language had the potential to reduce California’s capability of supporting digital currency startups.\n\nAlso read: Is California set to get its own BitLicense?\n\nBill Opponents Prevail\n\nColin Gallaher, Bitcoin Foundation Education Committee chair, called on people to sign a petition opposing the bill after stating that the new version of the bill is “even worse than before.” He said the bill’s language was so vague that it was uncertain which companies would be considered virtual currency businesses.

08/22/2016,"['2016 has perhaps seen a proliferation of new schools of thought under the crypto-currency genre, particularly thanks to the best known of all cryptocoins: Bitcoin. Among the most recent: the notion of Bitcoin maximalism.\n\nIn short, Bitcoin maximalists look down upon alternative use cases outside the domain of Bitcoin; i.e. Ethereum, Litecoin, even your beloved Dogecoin.\n\nA common thesis in this school of thoughts foresees a future of Bitcoin features, in which all of the things people want in a crypto-currency – for now, higher capacity and smart contracts – are coded atop the Bitcoin protocol. Soft forks have been executed in the Bitcoin use case before, and the experiment has momentum; that is, miners are interested in carrying on the tradition at high costs and expenses. Ethereum, furthermore, lots legitimacy over recent hacks.\n\nIn a video Bitcoin Uncensored Chris DeRose said:\n\nAnd it’s the only one that matters because block chains work. There’s a saying that we have here in South Florida and in our circle that because block chains work, miners are incentivised to join the longest chain. That’s going to be Bitcoin because of it’s fast mover advantage. I don’t see that changing and if you look some of these other alt. coins and you look at some of these competitors and when you compare them in various terms transaction volume, power consumption etcetera, etcetera, the numbers are significantly lower to the degree of multiple levels of magnitude even. So I think that Bitcoin is definitely the most prosperous Coin and will remain so for these reasons.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin maximalism relevant now? If 2015 was the year of financial institutions entering into the blockchain space to investigate blockchain usefulness, perhaps 2016 has thus far been the year in which the community grappled with the notions of crowdsales and decentralized socio-political governance of a blockchain protocol. When Ethereum’s DAO was compromised and $56 million withdrawn, the project’s rhetoric – which it framed as informational work – was exposed as propagandistic.\n\nEthereum lead developer Vitalik Buterin addressed the notion of Bitcoin Maximalism in 2016. He wrote:\n\n[E]ssentially, the idea that an environment of multiple competing cryptocurrencies is undesirable, that it is wrong to launch “yet another coin”, and that it is both righteous and inevitable that the Bitcoin currency comes to take a monopoly position in the cryptocurrency scene. Note that this is distinct from a simple desire to support Bitcoin and make it better; such motivations are unquestionably beneficial and I personally continue to contribute to Bitcoin regularly via my python library pybitcointools. Rather, it is a stance that building something on Bitcoin is the only correct way to do things, and that doing anything else is unethical (see this post for a rather hostile example). Bitcoin maximalists often use “network effects” as an argument, and claim that it is futile to fight against them.\n\nWhile Buterin tries to paint Bitcoin Maximalism as an ethical question – he states Bitcoin Maximalists believe it’s unethical to launch other blockchains – many so-called Bitcoin maximalism emphasizes cite economic arguments to bolster their case that, in the end, Bitcoin will persist and incentivize crypto-participants to use it over alternative crypto-currencies. In light of the DAO issues, this seems more prescient than ever – at least in terms of public blockchains.\n\nThat’s different from private blockchains. One thing Bitcoin Maximalism must address is what it sees as Bitcoin’s uses. It should also define itself as public blockchain specific, so as to not confuse public blockchains with private ones. While Bitcoin maximalism is radical, it’s nothing to shy away from. It’s merely a thesis that Bitcoin will persist.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A winning bidder claimed 2,700 BTC (worth $1.58m) at an auction held by the US Marshals Service (USMS) today.\n\nUSMS representatives confirmed to CoinDesk that four bids were received in the auction, which took place between 13:00 and 19:00 UTC.\n\nThe event, by far the smallest held to date by the USMS, saw bitcoins confiscated in cases involving convicted Silk Road ringleader Ross Ulbricht and former federal agent Carl Force IV made available for sale.\n\nIn total, only five registered bidders sought to claim the 2,700 BTC block, the agency said.\n\nThe turnout was lower than observed in the most recent USMS auction, which took place last November.

Be it Locky, CryptXXX or one of the countless other variants of the data-encrypting malware, cybercriminals are making hundreds of thousands of dollars every month off the back of swathes of infected victims each paying a few hundred dollars each to get access to their files back.\n\nCybersecurity researchers have warned that ransomware represents the most problematic cyber-threat. The most infamous ransomware attack this year took place at the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, with the Los Angeles hospital forced to declare an ""internal emergency"" after its IT systems were locked down and held to ransom by hackers.\n\nRansom demands are typically made in Bitcoin, the cryptographic digital currency based on Blockchain distributed ledger technology, which offers a secure, often untraceable, method of making and receiving payments -- a perfect currency for those who want their financial activities to remain hidden.\n\nThe popularity of Bitcoin has grown significantly in recent years and ransomware has spiked in 2016: could the growth of the two therefore be tied together?\n\n""It\'s helping. I think that\'s definitely true. The existence of effectively anonymised payment mechanisms definitely plays into the hands of cybercriminals,"" says David Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab.\n\nHowever, online extortion still took place regularly before the rise of Bitcoin. Emm recalls how some extortionists even attempted to use traditional postal services to receive payments for scams based on viruses.\n\nSome of these viruses did the same sort of thing as ransomware, but were nowhere near as successful because authorities could watch the location where the payment was delivered to see who picked it up.\n\n""It wasn\'t successful because police could monitor the PO boxes, so as soon as someone went to pick up the goods, you could arrest them,"" says Emm.', ""California Assemblymember Matt Dababneh (D-Encino) had been floating a bill to regulate Bitcoin (A.B. 1326) one that aggravated many in the relevant virtual currency community.\n\nDababneh withdrew the bill last week. As he said in a written statement:\n\nthe current bill in print does not meet the objectives to create a lasting regulatory framework that protects consumers and allows this industry to thrive in our state. More time is needed and these conversations must continue in order for California to be at the forefront of this effort.\n\nHe's still very, very concerned about consumer risk, though, and threatens to approach the topic with a new bill next year.\n\nBitcoin News summed up concerns about Dababneh's initial approach:\n\nNew York's famous BitLicense regulation did a tremendous job of pushing the vast majority of Bitcoin startups out of the state. It left only one (Circle) to completely jump through the onerous set of flaming rings. Maybe that was the entire goal, to remove any future financial competition from the financial sectors incumbents?....\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) was proud of its role in helping turn Dababneh around on the matter. Some of their issues with his proposed bill:\n\n....the bill's goal to protect consumers would have ironically been frustrated by the legislation, as it would have restricted access to currencies that benefit consumers in ways that non-digital currencies do not. Many digital currencies allow individuals to directly transact with one another even when they do not know or trust each other. These currencies have significant benefits to consumers as they eliminate the third parties needed in non-digital transactions that can often be the sources of fraud or other consumer harm. Further, intermediaries in traditional currency transactions, such as payment processers, are often the targets of financial censorship, which ultimately inhibits people's ability to support controversial causes or organizations. Because the bill would have allowed California's Department of Business Oversight to determine which digital currency businesses operated in California, the government would have been deciding which currencies and businesses could be used, rather than consumers. This would have significantly limited Californians' digital currency options, to their detriment.....\n\nEFF also felt the bill's drafting was based in misunderstanding of the world of digital currencies that would have led to some regulatory absurdities:"", 'The state of Florida has appealed a recent court decision that saw a judge dismiss charges against a local bitcoin seller.\n\nThe news marks the latest twist in Florida v Michell Espinoza, a case filed in 2014 in which a Florida-based bitcoin seller was brought up on charges for unlicensed money transmission and money laundering.\n\nThe case is best known for a decision by Judge Teresa Mary Pooler in which she sided with Espinoza\'s attorneys when they argued that bitcoin doesn\'t qualify as money. She wrote in her decision at the time that she believes it remains difficult to ""accurately define or describe bitcoin"", while expressing hesitation about ruling against a defendant using statutes she described as ""vaguely written"".\n\nThough the appeal won\'t deal with this issue, the move by the state to appeal the decision, some say, isn\'t terribly shocking.\n\nAttorney Andrew Hinkes, who has written about the Espinoza ruling in the past, said he wasn\'t surprised by the news.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""The standard of review on appeal is de novo meaning that the appellate court will review the evidentiary record made before the trial court and rule on evidence and matters of law without regard to the trial court’s rulings. Thus, the appeal to the Third District Court of Appeal is basically a \'second bite at the apple\' for the State.""\n\nHinkes went on to argue that the situation illustrates the potential pitfalls of a state-by-state approach to regulating the technology, whereby each state could develop conflicting rules for industry firms.\n\n""This appeal may provide needed clarity as to Florida’s laws, or simplify issues for the legislature,"" he added.\n\nNo details about case filings have been made available to date, according to court records.

This is one of the final steps in the software release process and initiates the Gitian build process.\n\nBitcoin Core 0.13.0 was developed by some 100 contributors over a period of about five months. And while much of the development effort over this time has also been focused on Segregated Witness, which will be activated only in a future minor release of the software, Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 includes about a dozen notable improvements compared to Bitcoin Core 0.12.0.\n\nThese are the most important changes.\n\nChild Pays for Parent\n\nThe number of transactions on the Bitcoin network has been steadily growing over time. As a result, more blocks have been filling up, and miners typically charge higher fees to include transactions into blocks. Transactions that don't include sufficient fees usually take longer to confirm, or perhaps even never confirm at all. This has proved to be somewhat problematic, especially in periods where so-called “stress tests” were conducted on the network, with spikes in the total number of transactions on the network and substantial transaction delays.\n\nIndividual users can solve this problem by including a higher fee in their transactions, incentivizing miners to prioritize these transactions. This is possible even after a transaction is sent, using Opt-in Replace-by-Fee (RBF); however, not many wallets include this option yet. Additionally, RBF is only an option for the sender of a transaction. Up till now, the receiver had no way to bump the fee for an incoming transaction to speed up confirmation.\n\nThis problem is effectively solved with a trick called “Child Pays for Parent” (CPFP). CPFP is a policy used by miners to select which transactions to include in blocks. With CPFP, miners don't necessarily pick the highest paying (and valid) transactions, but instead pick the most profitable set of transactions. In other words: they will select a low-fee transaction if a subsequent transaction that relies on the low-fee transaction offers a high enough fee to compensate. The miner will include both at the same time.\n\nIn practice, this means that the receiver of a low-fee transaction can “attach” a high-fee transaction, spending the same coins to himself. Incentivized by the new, high-fee transaction, a miner will include the set of transactions. As such, the receiver won't have to wait as long for a confirmation, while the miner can increase his income.\n\nCompact Block Support\n\nBitcoin's peer-to-peer protocol is currently somewhat inefficient. Nodes send each other most transaction data twice: once as a transaction as it is initially sent over the network, and once as part of a block when the transaction is confirmed.\n\nThis has some disadvantages. For one, sending transaction data twice requires more bandwidth than it really should, which adds to the cost of running Bitcoin Core. Second, and perhaps more importantly, forwarding new blocks to several peers at the same time can cause significant outbound bandwidth spikes. This potentially disrupts internet-usage each time a new block is found, which is potentially annoying for users. And perhaps, more importantly, it can slow down block propagation over the network as well. Slow block propagation can, in turn, favor bigger mining pools, thereby incentivizing a more centralized mining landscape.\n\nCompact Blocks (BIP 152), developed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Matt Corallo, are designed to decrease excess data-transmission. When a new block is found, nodes initially only communicate very compact hashes of transaction data. As nodes have already received the full transaction data when it was originally sent over the network, they can use these hashes to figure out which transactions are included in the block and reconstruct the block themselves.\n\nThis trick does not always work out perfectly, however. If a node did not yet receive the initial transaction before receiving the hashes, that node, of course, can't select the transaction. Additionally, in rare cases a wrong transaction may hash into a right hash, fooling the node into believing it received the right transaction until it tries to reconstruct the block and finds it doesn't add up.\n\nIn both these cases of failure, the node simply requests the specific transaction data after all. Even with only some complete transactions in them, Compact Blocks will transmit over the network much faster, and require significantly less bandwidth.\n\nHierarchical Deterministic Key Generation\n\nUp till now, Bitcoin Core generated a new and completely random public and private key pair for each new Bitcoin address. While this is important for security and privacy reasons, it can also be a bit of a burden for users. In order to secure all private keys against loss, they need to make regular backups.\n\nHierarchical Deterministic (HD) Key Generation (BIP 32), a cryptographic trick developed throughout 2012 and 2013 by Bitcoin Core developers Gregory Maxwell and Dr. Pieter Wuille, and Armory-developer Alan Reiner, solves this problem. With HD key generation, Bitcoin Core creates a completely new key pair for each new address, but all these keys are derived from a single, 12-word seed. As long as users remember this 12-word seed, they can re-generate all private keys and access all their funds.\n\nIt should be noted that HD Key Generation is not a new feature in the Bitcoin world. Many wallets already included the option for several years. It just never existed in Bitcoin's reference client — until now.\n\nPerformance & Security\n\nAnd of course, Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 introduces a significant list of performance and security upgrades. The full extent of these improvements is beyond the scope of this article (see Bitcoin Core 0.13.0's release notes for all the details), but in short...\n\nThe database cache memory has been increased, which allows nodes to speed up transaction validation and more. The Bitcoin command line tool now allows users to type passphrases and other sensitive information interactively, improving security by not storing this information in plain text. The software is updated to use C++11 and Python 3, newer versions of the programming languages, that allow for more powerful features. ARM (a specific microprocessor architecture) binaries for Linux are now part of the release, so users don’t have to compile this for themselves. Data concerning which transactions in a mempool rely on each other (as utilized with CPFP) can be communicated to external programs. Nodes on the network can request to receive only transactions that meet a certain fee threshold to prevent DoS attacks. And, lastly, there have been a lot of low-level improvements to the peer-to-peer, remote procedure call, and messaging system (ZMQ) protocols.\n\nThanks to Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan and Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo for information and feedback.\n\nNote: Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 was officially released on August 23; the original title of this article, announcing its release on August 22, was incorrect. It had been tagged for release, which typically means it will be released within a couple of days. Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 can now be downloaded on bitcoincore.org and bitcoin.org.

""Maybe get a conversation going?

Levin commented:\n\n""In Bitcoin, people like to send small payments to addresses, sometimes with embedded messages, sometimes without.

But whenever something new comes in the scene, there are more sceptics than believers. Eight years on and bitcoin sceptics are still plentiful, the biggest being the Reserve Bank of India. Let us examine why the legality of this form of digital cryptocurrency has more nayes than ayes.\n\nIn the current scenario, the RBI does not regulate the usage of bitcoins in India, but it is keeping a keen eye on this currency.\n\nOn December 2013, the RBI issued a statement cautioning “the users, holders and traders of Virtual currencies (VCs), including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to.”\n\nAmong the central bank’s various concerns, the RBI said that since bitcoins are stored in an e-wallet, which is not created by or traded through any authorised central body, it is prone to “losses arising out of hacking, loss of password, compromise of access credentials, and malware attack.”\n\nBitcoin is legal in most developed countries in the world like USA, EU, and Japan. Even in India, bitcoin is legal as per all existing Indian laws.\n\nEchoing this sentiment, Arvind Sahay, Professor of Marketing and International Business at IIM-Ahmedabad, said that the recent bitcoin hack worth $65 million at Binfinex is making people think. “Suddenly, people are not so sure if bitcoins are that secure as it claims to be,” he said.\n\nBut keeping the security issues aside, various research and legal organizations say that just because there are no laws governing bitcoin distribution in the country, it doesn’t mean that it is illegal.\n\nAccording to a research paper by PSA Legal Counsellors, a Delhi-based law firm, even though bitcoins are not authorized, there is enough scope for them to be legalized under different legislations.\n\nFor example, the research paper says the following: “As per the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, currency is defined as ‘all currency notes, postal notes, postal orders, money orders, cheques, drafts, travellers cheques, letters of credit, bills of exchange and promissory notes, credit cards or such other similar instruments, as may be notified by the Reserve Bank’. According to the definition, RBI has the power to include bitcoins within the definition of currency. Currency other than ‘Indian currency’ is termed as ‘foreign currency’, and regulated by foreign exchange laws. Most likely bitcoins can be governed by foreign exchange laws.”\n\nRelated: WaterAid raises funds worth 1,000 Swedish crowns via Bitcoins\n\nNishith Desai Associates, which have advised startups, entrepreneurs, and investors on bitcoin practices, in a 2013 whitepaper said that in the current framework, bitcoins are legal in the country.\n\n“The Government of India ought to recognize bitcoin as an opportunity and harness this opportunity for the social and economic betterment of the nation. As the Internet represented an opportunity, bitcoin too represents an opportunity which, as highlighted by various eminent commentators, can help in decentralization of economic power, greater financial access and ultimately, break down socio-economic barriers,” the research said.\n\nBitcoin exchange platforms in India also agree that its illegality is a perception, which needs to be changed.\n\nSandeep Goenka, co-founder of Zebpay, a Singapore-based bitcoin exchange platform, said, “There is a perception that bitcoin is illegal. This is a myth which needs to be broken. Bitcoin is legal in most developed countries in the world like USA, EU, and Japan. Even in India, bitcoin is legal as per all existing Indian laws.

08/23/2016,"['Martin Arnold AUGUST 23, 2016 66 Four of the world’s biggest banks have teamed up to develop a new form of digital cash that they believe will become an industry standard to clear and settle financial trades over blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin. UBS, the Swiss bank, pioneered the “utility settlement coin” and has now joined forces with Deutsche Bank, Santander and BNY Mellon — as well as the broker ICAP — to pitch the idea to central banks, aiming for its first commercial launch by early 2018. The move, to be announced on Wednesday, is one of the most concrete examples of banks co-operating on a specific blockchain technology to harness the power of decentralised computer networks and improve the efficiency of financial market plumbing. “Today trading between banks and institutions is difficult, time-consuming and costly, which is why we all have big back offices,” said Julio Faura, head of R&D and innovation at Santander. “This is about streamlining it and making it more efficient.” Blockchain technology is a complex set of algorithms that allows so-called cryptocurrencies — including bitcoin — to be traded and verified electronically over a network of computers without a central ledger. Having initially been sceptical about it because of worries over fraud, banks are now exploring how they can exploit the technology to speed up back-office settlement systems and free billions in capital tied up supporting trades on global markets. The total cost to the finance industry of clearing and settling trades is estimated at $65bn-$80bn a year, according to a report last year by Oliver Wyman. There are several rival digital cash systems being developed. Setl, a London-based group founded by hedge fund investors and trading executives last year, also aims to settle financial market payments with digital cash linked directly to central banks. Citigroup is working on its own “Citicoin” solution, while Goldman Sachs has filed a patent for a “SETLcoin” to allow trades to be settled near-instantaneously. JPMorgan is also working on a similar project. In depth Bitcoin As interest in bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currency The utility settlement coin, based on a solution developed by Clearmatics Technologies, aims to let financial institutions pay for securities, such as bonds and equities, without waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed. Instead they would use digital coins that are directly convertible into cash at central banks, cutting the time and cost of post-trade settlement and clearing. The coins, each convertible into different currencies, would be stored using the blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, allowing them to be quickly swapped for the financial securities being traded. “You need a form of digital cash on the distributed ledger in order to get maximum benefit from these technologies,” said Hyder Jaffrey, head of fintech innovation at UBS. “What that allows us to do is to take away the time these processes take, such as waiting for payment to arrive. That frees up capital trapped during the process.” Podcast Banks hijack bitcoin technology Four of the world’s biggest banks are collaborating on a new blockchain project to transform the way securities trades are processed, with the aim of making it cheaper and safer. Patrick Jenkins asks Martin Arnold, the FT’s banking editor, to explain what’s behind the development. He said the project team would spend the next year seeking the approval and co-operation of regulators and central banks and aim for a “limited and low-risk” commercial launch by early 2018. The consortium members plan to argue that the system would improve transparency for regulators. The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada are among central banks examining the potential benefits of digital currencies. But concerns include the security and the impact on banking stability. David Treat, head of Accenture’s capital markets blockchain practice, said the technology was still at a stage of having “three to five years before we get things adopted at scale and several more years before it goes mainstream”.

According to CoinMarketCap, one bitcoin was worth about $230 around September 2015. Compared to its current rate of about $580 (as at the time of this writing), it has attained an increase of more than 150% in value.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has fluctuated wildly since it was launched in 2009. In 2010, two pizzas were bought for 10,000 bitcoin. Three years later, one bitcoin was worth $1,000 in value.\n\nIt has also been through several ups and downs such as hacking controversies. In 2014, it was Mt Gox. Earlier this month, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex exchanged was hacked and bitcoins worth about $78m were stolen causing a 20% drop in the value of the currency.\n\nSuch drop or controversies have not stopped people from going digital with their money, using Bitcoin the paperless, bankless, and stateless currency which exists on computers.\n\nIt’s been profitable for many who invested in it even as confidence in the cryptocurrency has been building with more companies such as Dell, Tesla and Microsoft now accept it as a form of payment.\n\nHowever, following the cryptocurrency lead has been debatable for some reasons especially for new users.\n\nAccording to a Guardian article, the list of firms accepting Bitcoin is growing to include such as CheapAir.com and Britain’s first bitcoin pub, The Pembury Tavern in Hackney, London, where a pint of Milton Pegasus costs £3.70 or 0.0084 bitcoin.\n\nThe article cites Lex Deak, chief executive of alternative investment aggregator Off3r, as saying that investing in the cryptocurrency isn’t for the fainthearted. “You should only invest a small proportion of your money and be prepared for massive swings in value.” He added that the early gold rush days are over and buyers shouldn’t treat it as a get-rich-quick scheme. “You could double your money within a year, but you could easily lose it all,” he says.\n\nMarc Warne, the founder of Bittylicious, a site where bitcoins can be bought, says the same to start with a small amount to begin with.\n\nAs bitcoin has a 21 million finite supply, Warne says future price movement will depend on demand adding that Bitcoin will be used more in the future because it’s the first time that something not fully controlled by any entity like a government or bank has been used over the internet.\n\nFor Dave Hrycyszyn of digital agency Head, which advises companies on new technologies, while the lack of Bitcoin regulation appeals to some, it also means it has none of the stability mechanisms typically associated with a currency which can make it volatile.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Image: Getty\n\nAn anonymous bidder purchased 2,700 bitcoins worth about $1.6 million in an anonymous auction held by US Marshals Service on Monday. The Feds confirmed the sale to CoinDesk, a site that reports on the digital currency, and said that four bids were received in the auction.\n\nThe US Marshals announced earlier this month its plans to auction off some of the assets seized through criminal, civil, and administrative cases involving the dark web commerce market the Silk Road. The agency made 2,719 bitcoins available for purchase during the auction.\n\nIf you’re wondering who won the bid, you’re not alone. Winners of these types of auctions only have to make themselves public if they choose. For example, New York-based bitcoin exchange itBit publicly confirmed it purchased one of the auction blocks in November when US Marshals sold other Silk Road assets. The winner of the most recent auction remains a mystery.\n\nThree years ago, when the US government busted Silk Road, everyone’s favorite illegal drug website, it seized a massive bitcoin wallet worth about $28 million. The Feds have since been auctioning off those assets. In November, it held four separate auctions to rid themselves of the assets seized by the Silk Road. In the fourth auction, the agency sold 44,000 bitcoins worth about $14.6 million.', 'A federally funded research lab run by Lockheed Martin is developing a bitcoin analytics tool for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nThe project, first detailed in a 19th August newsletter published by Sandia National Laboratories, marks a continuation of previously detailed efforts at the DHS. The project is being funded by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate, which late last year issued a call for blockchain research.\n\nThus far, the bitcoin project appears to be in the early stages – Sandia has reportedly created a set of ""requirements"" for an analysis tool and is moving to develop a user interface to enable additional tests.\n\nAndrew Cox, an R&D analyst for Sandia, said during an interview published in the newsletter that the tool would be best utilized as part of a broader investigatory effort involving multiple angles.\n\nHe remarked:\n\n""To be successful, the reality is it’s going to take different types of algorithms and additional types of investigative techniques including good old-fashioned police work. They’re all going to have to be combined.""\n\nHe went on to argue that such tools would actually encourage broader bitcoin adoption\n\n""In many ways, figuring out how to effectively combat illicit bitcoin commerce and reduce its perception as a tool of criminals can encourage more people and companies to adopt bitcoin for legitimate purposes,"" he said.\n\nFounded in the late 1940s, Sandia\'s traces its lineage back to the Manhattan project and the invention of the atomic bomb.

Launched in 2011 and branded the ""silver to bitcoin\'s gold"", litecoin aims to offer faster transaction confirmation times for merchants.\n\nAt press time, it was the fourth larest digital currency by market cap.\n\nNotably, litecoin prices began edging upwards far before the actual announcement, spurred by cryptic tweets and messages from Lee. According to data from BitcoinWisdom, the price of litecoin began to spike at roughly 9:00 UTC, rising from $3.58 to roughly $3.80 at 18:00 UTC, the time of the announcement.\n\nDuring the session, LTC rose 9.3% to $4.01 amid heavy volume.\n\nBut, the move may have been subdued, as the market has long been aware of GDAX’s plans to list litecoin. (The exchange first revealed it would add the digital currency at some later date on 20th May).\n\nData suggests traders may have gone so far as to price in this listing long before it happened, as LTC rose to $4.83 by 28th May and $5.95 by 17th June, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.\n\nAt the time trading began on 23rd August, 1 LTC cost $3.66, nearly 40% below the high reached in mid-June.\n\nSeveral traders reported to hearing rumors about the exchange’s plans as well, with one remarking the market likely ""bought the rumor and sold the news"".\n\nTemporary bump\n\nWhile the increase is notable, some analysts emphasized it could merely be a temporary bump. In addition, others voiced their concerns about litecoin\'s long-term viability, echoing criticisms that have long faced the project about its lack of innovative features.\n\nPetar Zivkovkski, director of operators for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk the move does nothing to change the digital currency’s ""fundamentals"".\n\n""The fact that GDAX added the pair to trade has given it temporary bullishness, but unfortunately we do not see this lasting unless some other catalyst provokes a sustained trend,"" he said.\n\nArthur Hayes, CEO of leverage bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, also painted a picture of LTC’s price gains being only temporary.\n\n""The price move was in anticipation of the addition of litecoin by Coinbase,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nGoing forward, it will be interesting to see whether litecoin can maintain either the price gains or robust trading volume it enjoyed today. Still, most traders were bearish on the idea.\n\nOnce valued at more than $48 during the bitcoin boom of late 2013, litecoin has since struggled to grow its market. Others suggested the move was motivated by GDAX’s need to add additional currencies to complement bitcoin and ether, which it added earlier this year.\n\n""GDAX is presumably just responding to trader interest,"" said cryptocurrency investment fund manager Jacob Eliosoff.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.\n\nCoinbase image via Facebook; Charts via BitcoinWisdom\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'The revolution will not be televised. It\'ll be sent to your inbox by us.\n\nSomeone has purchased $1.6 million worth of bitcoin from the U.S. Marshals Service. That’s not a bad haul, and whoever purchased the bitcoins gets to hold on to some of the cryptocurrency seized from the illicit Silk Road marketplace. So why did only five people bother to place bids for the block of 2,700 bitcoins?\n\nThe USMS announced its intent to auction off the stash in a one-day event that ran for six hours on Monday. CoinDesk reported last night that someone did indeed place a winning bid on the stash.\n\nThe auction was the last related to the Silk Road bust that saw 144,000 bitcoins seized. Previously, the USMS sold 44,000 bitcoins to four winners; only 11 people are said to have bid on that $14.6 million block of bitcoins.\n\nSo why are people so hesitant to bid for these Bitcoin? It can’t be that they’re worried about a warning that Bitcoin’s underlying tech was being targeted by Chinese government hackers, as that warning was published long after the USMS started holding the auctions in mid-2014.\n\nPerhaps it’s because venture capitalist Tim Draper bought all 30,000 bitcoins sold in the first auction by outbidding 44 other people. This could have scared potential bidders off because they feared they wouldn’t be able to match the amounts bid by people with pockets as deep as the Draper family’s.\n\nOr maybe it’s because the feds wanted a $100,000 deposit for entering the auction. That’s a pretty high barrier to entry, and if investors like Draper already filled their digital coffers, the potential audience for this auction would be much smaller than previous auctions. Many of the cryptocurrency’s enthusiasts probably can’t afford a $100,000 deposit just for the possibility of buying up some bitcoins.\n\nAnother possibility is that Bitcoin might just not seem like a good investment. It was riding high earlier this year with a $750 conversion rate, but it’s trading at roughly $580 at time of writing. Mix the high barrier to entry, the tumultuous market, and probably a heaping helping of paranoia about buying the cryptocurrency from the feds and you have the makings of a boring auction.\n\nHello!

But it presents a double bind: bitcoin is pseudonymous, allowing folks to buy meth with a degree of privacy, but it\'s also set up so that every transaction is traceable on a public ledger called the blockchain—not exactly ideal if you never, ever, ever want anybody finding out about your online habit.\n\nNow, there\'s an alternative. On Monday, AlphaBay—the largest online market for drugs and other unsavoury items like fraud tools—announced on Reddit that the platform is adding support for an ostensibly super-anonymous cryptocurrency called Monero starting on September 1st, citing its ""security features.""\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Isn\'t the Criminal Safe Haven People Think It Is\n\nSo, what is Monero? The first thing to know is that unlike most other bitcoin rivals, Monero wasn\'t built using bitcoin\'s own code. Instead, it\'s based on a protocol called CryptoNote that was first described in a 2012 whitepaper written by one ""Nicolas van Saberhagen,"" an assumed pseudonym not unlike the one adopted by bitcoin\'s Satoshi Nakamoto. While Monero shares similarities with bitcoin, like mining and a blockchain as core mechanics, it has some big differences that help its users maintain their anonymity online, at least according to the currency\'s advocates.\n\nBitcoiners will often use a single wallet address, and all transactions connected to it are viewable by anyone. In contrast, Monero creates unique addresses for every transaction with a private ""viewkey"" that only lets the receiver, and whomever they give the viewkey to, access the full transaction information. In theory, that means no snooping by the feds. Monero also ""mixes"" coins automatically—basically jumbling one transaction with other similarly-sized ones—adding another layer of confusion for anybody trying to trace a transaction through the blockchain.\n\nThat selling point has buoyed consistent and low-level interest in Monero since its inception in 2014. On Monday, the day of the AlphaBay announcement, Monero was trading at a market cap of roughly $40 million USD compared to bitcoin\'s market cap of more than $9 billion. By early Tuesday morning, Monero\'s market cap was nearly $60 million.\n\n""It\'s more secure than bitcoin since the transaction blockchain of bitcoin can be viewed publicly""\n\n\n\n""It makes perfect sense for the darknet auction site to welcome Monero,"" Tyler Moffitt, senior threat researcher for security firm Webroot, wrote me in an email. ""It\'s more secure than bitcoin since the transaction blockchain of bitcoin can be viewed publicly.""\n\nAccording to former Bitcoin Foundation head and security researcher Peter Vessenes, Monero gets ""okay marks"" on its core technology, but it could be overpromising when it comes to protecting the privacy of criminals.\n\nFor example, Vessenes wrote me in an email, the fact that there\'s still only a relatively small number of Monero users means that any massive transaction will stick out like a sore thumb: there just won\'t be many others of a similar size to mix with. That would defeat the coin\'s promise of privacy, especially for drug vendors moving large amounts of product.\n\n""If you think about moving say $2 million in a currency like this, you\'re going to have a lot of trouble,"" Vessenes wrote. ""Monero works by sort of combining up your transaction volumes with other similarly sized transactions in round amounts—it\'s going to be pretty hard to find people to do those large-scale moves with you.""\n\n""The switching cost from just using bitcoin to using Monero is going to be high""\n\n\n\nFor the average user sending small amounts of money, however, ""My sense is that there is a larger anonymity set that you are a part of in Monero than within a bitcoin mixer,"" Jonathan Levin, co-founder of bitcoin blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, wrote me in an email.\n\nIf Monero takes off on AlphaBay, it could create the critical mass needed to deliver on its own promises. It\'s a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy: widespread use on dark net markets might drive increased investment in and usage of Monero, thereby solving the privacy problem created by a relatively small pool of users. Indeed, AlphaBay\'s Reddit post announcing its move to Monero stated: ""We expect this to cause a spike in the price, so if you are an investor, now is the time to purchase Monero.""\n\nThis isn\'t the first time a cryptocurrency promising better privacy than bitcoin has tried to break into the markets, making some users skeptical about the promise of Monero. Dash, a cryptocurrency that formerly went by the name Darkcoin, received substantial media attention when a few mid-sized markets implemented it in 2014. Two years later, Dash hasn\'t been implemented on any online dark net markets worth noting.\n\n""The switching cost from just using bitcoin to using Monero is going to be high, since not only is there a tech shift, a trust issue, there is also greater volatility,"" Levin wrote. The $20 million overnight jump in Monero\'s market cap, while potentially indicating increased usage and thus greater anonymity, also means that the currency\'s value is highly volatile.\n\nIf Monero takes off, it just might be the super-anonymous currency that the web\'s secretive drug economy has been waiting for.', 'The number of attacks on computers is increasing almost exponentially these days. The latest one to make news is the Rex Linux Trojan. This “Swiss knife” of a malicious program is a piece of work capable of running DDoS attacks, hold the infected computer for ransom (ransomware) and even mine Bitcoin without the user’s knowledge.\n\nBuilt on Google’s Go platform, the Trojan was first identified by cyber security firms three months ago. The earlier version of Rex Linux Trojan was much weaker and it was found targeting Drupal websites. Security experts were able to defeat the ransomware easily. However, Rex Linux Trojan as evolved since then to become a considerable threat.\n\nAccording to reports, the malware uses peer to peer communication network and has 5 major parts and it is capable of attacking more than just CMS platforms like Drupal. The different parts of Rex Linux Trojan include an attack vector, Bitcoin mining capability, Command and Control Communication, ransomware and DDoS attack.\n\nThe malware is delivered by bots scanning the internet for vulnerable websites. It is found to take advantage of multiple well-known security vulnerabilities of the platforms. Rex Linux Trojan makes use of CVE-2014-3704 Drupalgeddon vulnerability for infecting Drupal based web platforms. Similarly, Magento based websites are targeted using Shoplift RCE bugs. Many plugins on WordPress are found to be vulnerable to Rex Linux Trojan. Some of the compromised plugins include WooCommerce, Robo Gallery, Rev Slider, WP-Squirrel, Site Import, Brandfolder, Issuu Panel and Gwolle Guestbook.\n\nOnce infected, the ransomware scans the database using “RansomScanner” to retrieve the administrator’s email address. Upon retrieving the contact information, Rex Linux Trojan sends an email demanding a Bitcoin ransom to be paid in order to prevent the site from coming under a DDoS attack. The cryptocurrency mining portion of the ransomware is also used to launch DDoS attacks on infected websites.\n\nIt is found that the communication between ransomware and its Command and Control server happens through Kademlia P2P network on port 5099. While the cybersecurity platforms consider this to be a significant development, it is still not listed as a serious threat due to lack of reported DDoS incidents involving this ransomware yet.\n\nRecently, a Russian antivirus company Doctor Web announced the discovery of Linux.Lady. Linux.Lady is also a Trojan built on Google Go, targeting Linux servers running Redis NoSQL database. Once infected, the malware turns the machine into cryptocurrency miners.\n\nWebsite administrators are advised to update all the services to patch any known security vulnerabilities on their websites. This is expected to protect them from Rex Linux Trojan at the moment.', 'Verizon Communications has filed a patent for a Blockchain technology for managing passcodes.\n\nThe telecom giant, the largest in the US, filed the patent in May.

Thus, the first passcode may no longer be considered valid.”\n\nVerizon only the latest company to try to claim Blockchain-related patents\n\nWhile Blockchain technology is still new, many large companies have still tried to lay legal claim to the applications of this technology.

The Bank of America, meanwhile, has been busy writing dozens of patents pertaining to fintech and Blockchain tech.\n\nAlthough the world of cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology has largely grown up in the absence of any legal structure to guide (or restrict) its development, exceptions to this rule do exist. The Bitcoin exchange giant Coinbase filed a series of patents last year pertaining to Bitcoin and Blockchain tech.\n\nThe “Blockchain boom” is in full swing, a bubble that may pop soon\n\nBlockchain technology has become something of a trend recently. In the first half of 2016, Bitcoin and Blockchain startups raised almost $300 million in investment capital. This has led to speculation by industry experts that Blockchain tech could be in a bubble similar to that of the dot-com era of the late 1990s, and that this bubble will soon pop, causing an industry collapse.\n\nThis may be the case; however, Blockchain technology itself is here to stay.']"
08/24/2016,"['Watch out, Bitcoin! Wall Street is gunning for you.\n\nSwiss bank UBS is leading a team of four of the world’s biggest banks developing a system to enable financial markets to make payments and settle transactions quickly using blockchain technology.\n\nUBS has developed a “Utility Settlement Coin” (USC), which is a digital cash equivalent of each of the major currencies backed by central banks, such as the dollar or euro, rather than a decentralized new digital currency such as bitcoin.\n\nThe USC would be convertible at parity with a bank deposit in the corresponding currency, making it fully backed by cash assets at a central bank. Spending a USC would be the same as spending the real currency it is paired with, UBS said.\n\nBlockchain projects such as this have the potential to shake up the settlement system used by banks, under which transactions can take several days to finalize and which costs the financial industry $65 billion to $80 billion a year, according to an Oliver Wyman report last year.\n\n“Digital cash is a core component of a future financial market fabric based on blockchain technologies,” UBS Investment Bank’s head of fintech innovation Hyder Jaffrey said.\n\nThe Swiss bank first launched the concept in September 2015 with London-based blockchain company Clearmatics, and has been joined on the project by BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Santander and brokerage ICAP.\n\nBlockchain works as a tamper-proof shared ledger that can automatically process and settle transactions using computer algorithms, with no need for third-party verification.\n\nBecause it does not require manual processing, nor authentication through intermediaries, the technology can make payments faster, more reliable and easier to audit.\n\nSimilar systems are being developed by others, such as SETL, a London-based start-up run by City grandees, while some major banks are working on their own projects. But this is the first time big banks have teamed up to work on a digital cash settlement system.\n\nFinancial regulators are still trying to assess the implications of blockchain — also called “distributed ledger technology” — and whether it could meet technical, governance, legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe World Economic Forum said in a report this month that more than 90 central banks are discussing the use of blockchain, and estimated that 80 percent of the world’s commercial banks would have initiated projects using the technology by 2017.\n\n“The practical use and implementation possibilities of central bank digital currency is rightly becoming a hot topic in the financial service industry,” Deutsche Bank Global Transaction Banking Chief Digital Officer Edward Budd said.\n\n“It raises questions, and possibilities, over a fundamental market structure principle: who can have access to central bank money and how,” he said.', 'The idea of a digital currency has spread across every continent and almost every country since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, but it has met resistance throughout that journey from law makers and regimes right across the world. One of the most hostile regimes towards digital currencies has been that of Russia, who were even going as far as criminalizing the use of a digital currency, with a penalty of a fine of up to $40,000 or even prison sentences. However, last week that proposal was scrapped, and with a slightly less aggressive stance towards cryptocurrency in the country, just days later Moscow saw the opening of its first Bitcoin exchange.\n\nRussia has had a rocky relationship with the digital currency industry almost since its inception, at various times considering banning the use of any cryptocurrency outright along with various levels of restrictions also being considered by the lawmakers. Indeed, it was only a week ago that they rowed back on plans to criminalize Bitcoin use that could have seen fines of up to $40,000 or even prison sentences for those caught using any cryptocurrency. However, in the short time since that particular approach was abandoned, a Bitcoin Exchange has been launched in Moscow itself.\n\nThe exchange provides an offline service, and transactions are only one way, with customers visiting the exchange in person to sell their bitcoins in a private transaction. Bitcoin purchases are as yet not available. It has been opened by a team of bitcoin enthusiasts, and while this is a far cry from the services available elsewhere in the world, it is a significant step in a country whose authorities have been extremely hostile to the concept of digital currencies themselves. If this proves successful, the team are planning to officially register the exchange and expand on the services available while remaining in compliance with the local authorities.\n\nThere are two interesting things about this development, the first is the speed that the enthusiasts were able to get the exchange up and running once the lawmakers abandoned the proposal to criminalize digital currency use. This not only shows the enthusiasm within Russia for cryptocurrencies, but also demonstrates the market that has been waiting for the chance to be involved with the digital currency industry within the country.\n\nThe second is the move by the authorities to reverse their approach towards the cryptocurrency industry and refrain from trying to turn Bitcoin users into criminals. As one of the most openly hostile regimes towards digital currencies, this represents a significant step. Russia is a potentially huge market for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and this change in attitude from the authorities could allow the digital currency industry to really gain market penetration within the country now the threat of severe legislation has effectively been removed.', 'If you are looking at bitcoin, you may be at risk of not seeing the full potential of blockchain. Bitcoin is somewhat of a distraction from the value blockchain may deliver to commerce globally; bitcoin creates a blind spot for executives seeking a view of the future.\n\nEvery business depends on relationships. No surprise there, right? And common wisdom tells us that the foundation of all successful relationships is trust. So why do most businesses act as though no one can be trusted? Not suppliers, not partners, and not customers.\n\nLet\'s think about it. In commercial transactions, trust is rarely assumed as an automatic part of the equation. We create, operate and scale businesses in a trust vacuum, and we start by assuming that counterparties are likely to misrepresent, cheat or steal — or at least bend the attributes or status of asset inventory or transactions. So we insist on verifying every transaction with contracts, records and receipts. And we rely on intermediaries, who are now rampant in modern commerce, to negotiate and middle-manage many of our transactions.\n\nTake lawyers, for example. In 1900, there was one lawyer for every 667 people in the United States. By 1960, that ratio was 1:627, a relatively modest increase for a 60-year period that also included explosive growth in manufacturing, financial services and other economic sectors. Today, in 2016, there is one lawyer for every 247 people in the United States. For the past half century, the number of lawyers has grown much faster than the general population — driven in part by our increasing dependence on middlemen, contracts and intermediaries in all kinds of transactions.\n\nIn the video below, I cover the impact blockchain could have on healthcare — with a concept I call ""carechain.""\n\nThe time and expense these verification services and intermediaries require — and the friction and complexity they create in our business relationships — often seem insurmountable. Let\'s examine how difficult it has become to buy a home, a transaction that on the surface is relatively simple. Before the seller hands the buyer the keys, there are innumerable hand-offs and mini-transactions involving real-estate agents, mortgage brokers, inspectors, lenders, title insurance companies and lawyers — all rooted in the idea that buyers and sellers can’t trust each other and need third parties to protect their interests.\n\nToday, there is a relatively new design-and-exchange protocol that is installing trust in commerce at breakneck speed.\n\nThis design-and-exchange protocol is called “blockchain.” If you’re not familiar with blockchain, the concept was first explained in a paper published online in October 2008 by an entity made up of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. That paper described the bitcoin cryptocurrency built on a premise of many things, one of which is blocks of data chained together by unique techniques and then shared in a new type of ledger that is distributed by design. Bitcoin turned out to be the first application to conduct blockchaining. Bitcoin is just the first instance of the techniques that constitute the design-and-exchange protocol of blockchain.\n\nThe result of this bitcoin application/instance, blocking and chaining data in a ledger that is distributed by design, led to a broader and wider discovery around the value and technique of blockchains — today blockchain represents the largest transformative paradigm we may experience in our lifetimes.\n\nBlockchain basics\n\nBlockchain, a powerful and disruptive innovation that uses algorithms to enable the creation of ledgers of data that are secure and distributed by design, has the potential to transform the delivery of public and private services, increase productivity, and revolutionize the way we do business.\n\nHumans have been using ledgers for thousands of years to record the accumulation and exchange of assets such as money and property. As technology evolved, ledgers moved from clay tablets to paper to computers, but their basic format and function remained unchanged. Ledgers remained individually managed, and not shared by design. Blockchain offers something new, distributed ledgers.\n\nRichie Etwaru\n\nDistributed ledgers function as databases counting for inventory assets or statuses of transactions that can be shared across a network of multiple participants by design. All companies, organizations or governments in the network of participants have identical copies of the distributed ledger, and any change to one copy is verified by consensus and then automatically recorded in all. Distributed ledgers are transparent and collaborative, and cryptographic keys ensure their accuracy and security. The techniques of encryption, hashing and miners render blockchain distributed ledgers to be virtually unhackable.\n\nExecutive blind spot\n\nMany executives today can’t see the true potential of blockchain. When we look into the future, all we see is bitcoin. Blockchain remains hidden in our blind spot. But the blockchain technology is no secret.\n\nLarge companies such as Microsoft are already in. IBM recently announced a plan to launch one of the largest commercial uses of blockchain to date, to help its financing unit increase efficiency and free up working capital by resolving transaction disputes with customers and partners in the IBM value network. Venture capitalists have funded more than 1,000 blockchain startups. Over 50 governments have started exploring blockchain as a trust enabler for the public sector, while more than 40 big banks and financial firms are testing blockchain as a secure and transparent way to track asset ownership. Finally, by my estimate more than 50% of Fortune 100 companies have staff working on some “blockchain thing.”\n\nUnfortunately, however, most of these projects are pointing in the wrong direction, focusing on bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. That is the mistake, because bitcoin is to blockchain what the first AOL chat rooms were to the internet. Bitcoin is merely an early blockchain application, one that barely scratches the surface and offers an extremely limited view of blockchain’s potential to disrupt across multiple vertical industries and drive horizontal innovation throughout the economy.\n\nWhy is blockchain important to business?\n\nThe past four decades have been one of the most remarkable periods of invention in human history. During that time, we have seen the rise of personal computers, the internet, smartphones, cloud computing, holographic imaging and 3D printing, just to name a few innovations. Blockchain promises to outshine them all in terms of sheer cross-vertical impact.\n\nIn the diagram above, the internet (A) created the first digital consumption landscape in the network/security layers of commerce all the way up to consulting layers of commerce creating “online companies.” The cloud (B) reconfigured the competitive landscape in the storage layers of commerce all the way up to the marketing layer of commerce, unseating online companies with more efficient and effective “cloud companies.” Blockchain (C), promises to change commerce by starting with the way we organize and govern corporations at the bottom layer of commerce, and then reshape the consumption and competitive landscapes all the way up the stack ending at the top in the way we brand and market. Blockchain is a “total reset” of all layers of how commerce works today, representing massive potential of efficiency gains by redesigning all of the online and cloud companies.\n\nAre you thinking this all sounds like so much snake oil? Too good to be true? Keep in mind that many executives said the same thing about the internet 20 years ago. Look how that turned out.\n\nAs a forward-thinking executive, there are three things you need to know about blockchain:\n\nThe internet of trust: TCP/IP, which is the current technology design-and-exchange protocol, makes the internet a network of information exchange. Blockchain is the new protocol for exchanging anything of value — not just currency or information — over the internet. A blockchain is a type of database that pulls together various records into a block of virtually unhackable information that is verified and encrypted. Each block is then “chained” to other previously verified and encrypted blocks of information. For all participants in the same network, the whole process is completely transparent. The information in those blocks is seen by all and owned by none. Blockchain, as the protocol for exchanging value when trust is abundant, is creating the internet of trust.\n\nI am in the middle of using an online lease-trading site to get a rid of a car. I have a buyer willing to take over the lease, but it is taking four weeks to complete the transfer. The buyer paid $100 to file a credit application, it cost me $350 paid to my leasing company to transfer the lease, and we each paid the lease-trading site $350 to introduce us to each other. That’s a total of almost $1,200 and four weeks to transfer the lease from me to him. That’s a system built on the absence of trust. More to come on ""AutoChain.""\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations: Once trust is abundant between parties, truth emerges in transactions and asset inventory data, and consensus becomes easy. Consensus, the overall term for corroborating the accuracy and integrity of a ledger, is a direct byproduct of blockchaining. When consensus is cheap, easy and quick, organizations can operate in a more decentralized and autonomous way, no longer needing hierarchies and intermediaries to achieve consensus.\n\nDuring my career, I’ve been involved in several requests for proposal (RFP) for projects that aggregate to hundreds of millions of dollars. The ability to determine what projects responding suppliers have done in the past and what projects they can do successfully in the future gets lost in the sales journey that is locked into the RFP. Reaching consensus on choosing a supplier is often somewhat of an improper fraction. People who have power but little knowledge make decisions to override people who have knowledge but little power. And suppliers take advantage of this truth vacuum by wining and dining company executives essentially engineering consensus and bending truths. More to come on ""SupplyChain.""\n\nSmart contracts: When organizations are autonomous, and trust and consensus are at least available if not abundant, they can exchange value seamlessly in direct peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Here P2P is really a heterogeneous mix of organizations (sometimes fierce competitors) and consumers creating B2B2C networks. The power to exchange value is no longer in the center of the network for verification systems, contracting agencies or intermediaries to arbitrate. The power to exchange value freely, transparently, and reliably moves to the edge of the network. Smart contracts enable digital agreements between unusual parties and can be executed automatically by a computing system. By lowering the costs of contracting, enforcement and compliance, they make it economically feasible to use contracts to authenticate and enforce even low-value transactions.\n\nI happen to own a restaurant as a hobby investment. I use OpenTable to manage the seats and availability, and I’m attempting to start to use an OpenTable competitor called SeatMe as well. There is no central system where I can easily store all of my restaurant’s seat availability so that both SeatMe and OpenTable can access and update that information in real time. As a result, I am forced to manage two systems and manually update my inventory of available seats on both systems. Smart contracts between two competitors such as OpenTable and SeatMe could eliminate this type of unnecessary friction for business owners and promote healthy competition among vendors. More on ""TableChain"" to come.\n\nWrapping up\n\nThe purpose of this blog post is not to provide answers, but to help spark the questions we should all be asking about the potential of blockchain technology and the benefits it can create for businesses, organizations and governments worldwide. The hope is that we start to look past bitcoin, which I believe may be a distraction to the true value here.\n\nIt took about 12 years for the internet to progress from being what a lot of people considered snake oil to being a very real and transformative technology. Cloud computing got real in about half that time.\n\nBlockchain is evolving even faster and promises to profoundly change the way we live and work.\n\nChain or be chained.\n\nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

The new integration means that customers will be able trade Litcoin, both for Bitcoin and directly for US dollars. GDAX announced the implementation in a blog post:\n\n“Litecoin trading is now available on GDAX. We’re excited to continue supporting more digital assets to meet the demands of our growing customer base. Charlie Lee, Director of Engineering at Coinbase, developed Litecoin in 2011. Since then, Litecoin has become one of the most widely traded digital assets and continues to attract strong trader and investor interest worldwide.”\n\nCharlie Lee announced the development with enthusiasm via Twitter:\n\nLitecoin experienced a significant spike following the news, breaking with Bitcoin\n\nThe addition to LTC/USD trading on GDAX has led to Litcoin’s price experiencing a significant increase. In less than 24 hours, the price per coin jumped from around $3.68 to $3.95 USD. Notably, the currency, whose price famously mirrored that of Bitcoin over the years, rose sharply against its great competitor. This is likely due to the fact that Litecoin no longer depends as heavily on Bitcoin for trading.\n\nGrowing infrastructural gains for altcoins\n\nAs the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, more alternative currencies gain functionality which allows them to act more independently of Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum made adoption gains worldwide in exchanges and wallets before the DAO and Ethereum Classic debacle. Now, in addition to Litecoin, Dash has made several important gains, including integration into the Jaxx multiplatform wallet, as well as support in the BlockPay point-of-sale system.\n\nIn addition to Bitwala’s debit card, which accepts a variety of cryptocurrencies through ShapeShift integration, two other Bitcoin debit card providers, SpectroCoin and ShakePay, have announced plans to release Dash debit cards.', 'Though BitGo was the wallet software used by Bitfinex who lost $60m of its customers’ funds, Bitwala says it will still work with the provider as it launches its wallet services. Bitwala has added a Bitcoin wallet onto its platform to allow users to pay and send Bitcoins from within the Bitwala site through seamless website integration.\n\nIn a statement, the platform which enables sending money abroad and paying bills with Bitcoin in 17 currencies, announces that the wallet will allow users to have full control over their money.\n\nIt also supports Dash and Steem\n\nJörg von Minckwitz, CEO of Bitwala, notes that usability is vital when handling expenses with Bitcoin, and Bitwala is a step closer in bringing the currency into the mainstream as the wallet makes spending, holding and sending Bitcoins and Fiat easier.\n\nIt has also added Dash to the list of accepted Altcoins and Cryptocurrencies. This is after the addition of Steem and the release of Bitwala messenger earlier this month to allow users chat and make payments at the same time.\n\nSupposedly, when these additional services combine with the existing ones such as international bank transfers, debit cards etc they have the tendency to draw more users, as well as security issues. But Bitwala makes sure it applies high-security standards and compliance for its customers.\n\nThe issue of Bitfinex and stolen Bitcoins\n\nIn his blogpost, Bitwala’s co-founder Benjamin Jones says the problem of stolen Bitcoins from a BitGo wallet arose not from the BitGo software but how it was implemented. He explains that the Bitfinex setup allowed the attackers to gain access to at least two keys of a cold wallet requiring 2 of 3 keys to access the funds. He adds that BitGo could have raised some kind of alarm with such abnormal behaviour and their API documentation points to an insecure implementation.\n\nThus, Jones believes that BitGo is still the right choice for Bitwala because “BitGo is an extremely convenient and secure system when properly implemented.”', 'BTCTurk, a Turkish Bitcoin exchange which launched in July 2013, has finally terminated its operations in Turkey after local banks closed the main accounts of the company without prior notice. Such abrupt termination of services from banks and major financial institutions was seen last in Australia, when the country’s leading banks, including the multi-billion dollar banking group Commonwealth Bank, closed the bank accounts and financial services of Bitcoin startups in the region.\n\nTough choice for BTCTurk team\n\nIn contempt of their connections with the banks the company has collaborated with since 2013, local banks and financial institutions denied to provide any financial assistance or support to BTCTurk, which forced the Bitcoin exchange to terminate its operations permanently and return all user funds.\n\nAccording to the Daily Sabah, one of the largest media companies in Turkey, BTCTurk team stated that it is virtually impossible for the company to create any bank accounts to support its operations, which left the firm no other choice but to shut down the exchange and pull out from the Turkish market.\n\n“It appears that it is impossible for us to find a bank who agree to work with BTCTurk,” read the statement released by the company.\n\nFirst PayPal, now Bitcoin exchange - what’s going on?\n\nPaypal, arguably the most popular internet-based payment network was also asked to terminate its services in Turkey following the non-approval of its license by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency. The impractical and rigid financial regulations of the Turkish government forced a powerful financial institution such as Paypal to exit the local market.\n\nAt that time, the European Bitcoin startup Bitwala expressed their optimism towards the Turkish cryptocurrency market which has lost one of its strongest competitors. However, BTCTurk’s termination of services has proven that the Turkish financial market isn’t necessarily friendly towards digital currency-based startups, which is hindering the operations of the remaining Bitcoin startups in the region.\n\nWhile it may be beneficial for startups like Bitwala who are based outside of Turkey, cryptocurrency and fintech startups who maintain their operations with Turkish bank accounts could very possibly face serious conflicts regarding their financial support in the near future.\n\nUltimately, the exit of BTCTurk puts any fintech or cryptocurrency-related startups in Turkey in danger of losing their financial connections which are vital to their core operations.', 'Bitcoin price seems to be done with its climb, as sellers pushed for a break of the near-term channel support.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price broke below the ascending channel support on its 1-hour chart, signaling that a reversal from the uptrend is in order.\n\nTechnical indicators are still showing that the rally could resume at some point.\n\nA pullback to the broken channel support could take place before the selloff gains traction.\n\nBitcoin price seems to be done with its climb, as sellers pushed for a break of the near-term channel support.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is still above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is still to the upside. However, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing so a downward crossover might be possible, indicating a return in selling pressure.\n\nA continued drop could take bitcoin price to the $575 area next, then onto the longer-term area of interest at $550. However, stochastic is pointing up and might be hinting that bulls could put up a fight. In that case, bitcoin price could still retreat to the broken support at $580 before heading further south.\n\nA stronger return in buying pressure could take bitcoin back up to the channel resistance close to $590, although it would take a strong market catalyst to let that happen.\n\nMarket Events\n\nDollar strength carried on for the third day in a row, as risk aversion seems to be setting in the financial markets. Data from most major economies has been weaker than expected and even though the US printed its fair share of disappointing figures, investors are still drawn to the safe-haven dollar.\n\nApart from that, traders might be pricing in expectations of hawkish remarks from Fed Chairperson Yellen in her Jackson Hole Symposium testimony. A few policymakers have already given an upbeat assessment of the US economy, which has led many to believe that the Fed head would be upbeat as well.\n\nA major disappointment in her Friday speech could lead to a sharp unwinding in dollar gains, possibly boosting bitcoin price in the process.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

A new low below 0.00260BTC was formed, and it looks like the price is under a bearish pressure. As mentioned, this week’s highlighted connecting bearish trend line on the hourly chart of ETC/BTC (data feed via Simplefx) played a major role. It stalled the upside move in ETC and pushed it down.\n\nThe price traded as low as 0.00258BTC where the bulls appeared and currently attempting a recovery. The pair is currently trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the 0.00308BTC high to 0.00258BTC low, which is acting as a resistance. However, the most important hurdle on the upside remains the bearish trend line. Moreover, the 100 hourly simple moving average is also on the upside aligned with the trend line.\n\nSo, there is a crucial barrier for the buyers on the upside around the 0.00280BTC. Only a break above it could take the price towards the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the 0.00308BTC high to 0.00258BTC low.

Cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin has been the payment of choice for most people who are buying and selling drugs and other illegal items on the dark net.\n\n© AFP 2017/ Stephane De Sakutin This picture taken on June 20, 2014, shows a man placing his phone next to a Bitcoins (virtual currency) dispenser at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris.\n\nHowever, although it allows criminals to buy drugs with a degree of privacy, it is also set up to allow every transaction to be traceable on a public ledger called blockchain, which means that if you wanted your transaction to remain secret, it\'s not exactly ideal.\n\nAlphabay, one of the largest online markets for drugs and other illicit items announced that they will be accepting Monero as alternative payment to Bitcoins, starting from September 1, 2016.\n\nHow is Monero different than simply using a Bitcoin mixer? https://t.co/081cdSZIOD — /r/Bitcoin (@RedditBTC) 24 August 2016\n\n\u200bSo why is it that Bitcoin is not as good at keeping transactional secrets as Monero? Well, it appears that Monero is based on CryptoNote protocol, which has significant algorithmic differences in regards to blockchain obfuscation, which is what Bitcoin uses. CryptoNote protocol transitions cannot be traced, which means it does not reveal who sent or received the coins. This feature is missing from Bitcoin.\n\n\u200bBitcoiners will often use a single wallet address, which means that all transactions connected to it are viewable by anyone. But with Monero it creates a unique address for every transaction, with a private viewkey, which means that the receiver, who has the viewkey can access the full transaction information. In theory, that means nobody can spy on what you buy and transactions remain untraceable by the police.\n\n""It makes perfect sense for the dark net auction site to welcome Monero, it\'s more secure than Bitcoin since the transaction blockchain of bitcoin can be viewed publicly,"" said Tyler Moffitt, senior threat researcher for security firm Webroot in a recent interview.\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation have said that Monero is good, but they do believe users privacy can be compromised. The fact that there\'s still only a relatively small number of Monero users means that any massive transaction will stick out like a sore thumb: there just won\'t be many others of a similar size to mix with.']"

What you may not know is that an increasing number of banks are looking for ways to take advantage of blockchain, the technology that powers it, while steering clear of the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nDeutsche Bank (DB) , Banco Santander (SAN) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK) joined the field this week, announcing a partnership with broker ICAP, technology company Clearmatics, and UBS Investment Bank to create a ""utility settlement coin"" that can be used in cross-border payments and easily converted to central-bank currencies from the U.S. dollar to the euro and the British pound.\n\n""Digital cash is a core component of a future financial market fabric based on blockchain technologies,"" Hyder Jaffrey, UBS Investment Bank\'s head of strategic investment & fintech innovation, said in a statement. ""There are several digital cash models being explored across the Street. The utility settlement coin is focused on facilitating a new model for digital central bank cash.""\n\nAmong the key challenges in using the technology, which lets multiple parties access a secure ledger for a transaction without relinquishing control over their piece of the deal, ""is the need to represent cash, fiat currencies, in a blockchain format,"" Saket Sharma, who works with BNY Mellon\'s treasury services technology, said in an email. ""While it is still early days, we see the settlement coin as a potential enabling transaction for a wide variety of use cases.""\n\nThe utility settlement coin is among several financial-industry developments related to blockchain. The potential the distributed-ledger system has for improving efficiency behind the scenes is what caught banks\' attention. Because such ledgers could be accessible from multiple institutions, they might eliminate the need for reconciliations between systems and third parties.\n\n""Removing the need for a middle man, one lowers potential security concerns from hacking to corruption as well as speeding up manual processes that are antiquated and can take too long,"" Robert Boroujerdi, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in a report.

The answer is nothing at all, but that’s actually not a bad thing. Like most modern currencies bitcoin is not backed by gold or other precious commodities. In a sense, bitcoin’s value is derived from our common belief that bitcoin has value. The same is true of the American dollar, the British pound, and the European Union’s euro, as well as nearly every other modern currency.\n\nHistorically speaking, up until August 15th 1971 most currencies were backed by a commodity, usually gold or silver. In fact, before the invention of paper money, most currencies were coins fashioned from precious metals. Further, following World War II and up until 1971, most of the world’s countries operated under the Bretton Woods agreement, currencies were backed by gold.\n\nThe Bretton Woods Agreement and the End of Commodity Backed Currencies\n\nIn order to understand the current system, it’s important to understand the old system. Under the Bretton Woods system, central banks would be able to trade gold amongst one another, and currencies would be tied to the value of gold, and pegged against one another. When an exchange rate is pegged, this means its value is set. So if the American dollar buys .75 British pounds, that is the value that it is set at. Most peg rates are actually adjustable peg rates, meaning that policy makers can adjust the value when needed.\n\nThe Bretton Woods system was designed to reduce the currency fluctuations seen in the 1920’s and 1930’s. During this period currencies were moving rapidly and uncontrollably, which caused international instability, and helped to worsen the Great Depression, and create the conditions that led to the outbreak of World War II. While the Bretton Woods system worked well for awhile, it eventually caused disruptions of its own.\n\nThe End of Bretton Woods and the Rise of Fiat Currencies\n\nThe Bretton Woods succeeded in creating stability in the years immediately following the second World War. By the end of the 1960’s, however, serious faults in the system were beginning to emerge. Among the biggest faults was that the U.S. dollar was too strong, which caused disruptions in international trade. For this reason, among others, governments decided to abandon the agreement, and to use “fiat” currencies instead.\n\nBasically, a fiat currency is a free floating currency that is not backed by any sort of commodity. In the past, your dollars or other currencies would have been worth a certain amount of gold or another commodity. In practice, trading in dollars for gold was often highly restricted, still dollars were at least hypothetically worth a certain amount of gold.\n\nNow, the dollar is no longer tied to gold. Of course, you can still buy gold with your dollars, but their values are independent from one another. Most major currencies are also not pegged to one another, but instead are allowed to float. Exchange rates can thus vary between different currencies. A few years ago, a euro could have bought about $1.4 American dollars. Now? A euro will buy only about $1.13 dollars.\n\nBitcoin is sort of a Fiat Currency, but So What?\n\nLike the dollar and the euro, bitcoin and most other digital currencies are somewhat fiat. They are allowed to float in the market, and their value is determined by the market. In sense, you could even say that digital currencies and their value are determined by consensus.\n\nUnlike traditional fiat currencies, however, there are several key factors that make bitcoin’s value potentially more reliable. First, bitcoins must be mined through computers, which requires an investment of time and money. As it becomes more expensive to mine bitcoins, it is likely that the value of the bitcoins themselves will slowly increase.\n\nSecond, while governments can increase their money supply at any given time, thus depreciating the value of individual currency units, bitcoin’s supply is tightly regulated, and the number of new bitcoins entering the market is slowing decreasing. Bitcoin is not subject to the whims of government officials or anyone else for that matter. It is a free and independent currency.\n\nWhat “Backs” a Currency is Irrelevant, Perception is What Matters\n\nSince the end of the Bretton Woods agreement, the idea that commodities are needed to back currencies has become irrelevant. Instead, public perception and economic policies are what matter. Money has value because we believe it has value. This is true of the dollar, the euro, the pound, and yes even bitcoin.\n\nWe can trade our money for goods. Many retailers now accept bitcoin as payment. In fact, when evaluating new “exotic” currencies like bitcoin, adoption rates, the ability to buy goods and services, established history, and community size are arguably the best indicators of a currency’s value. Are people using it to buy goods? Is the community itself large, sustainable, and established? For bitcoin, the answer to these questions is yes.\n\nMany people think of bitcoin as more of an investment asset than a true currency. Part of the reason for is because bitcoin prices tend to swing somewhat dramatically. The value of all fiat currencies can swing also dramatically, however. This is true even for government-backed currencies, which are subject to the whim of government policies. The British pound, for example, has lost much of its value over the past few weeks following the Brexit vote.\n\nIn some cases, hyper inflation can even strike with money becoming nearly worthless. Consider Zimbabwe, where inflation got so bad a few years ago that the government started printing up 100 billion dollar bills. When the currency was phased out, 35 trillion Zimbabwean dollars equaled 1 American dollar. More recently, in April the IMF reported that Venezuela would suffer inflation of approximately 500% this year, and 1,800% next year. As this inflation unfolds, Venezuelan money will quickly lose its value.\n\nMore often than not, the rapid onset of inflation is caused by government mismanagement and the over-printing of money. This is why bitcoin aims to be government free. People create their own money through mining. Then, bitcoin is allowed to be freely traded in the market. Further, since the money supply itself is limited and already set, policy negotiations are no longer possible. So while it’s true that bitcoin isn’t tied to any commodity, and that it is dependent on our collection perception, like most modern currencies, the P2P currency is arguably a more reliable currency than government-backed fiat currencies.', 'Author Don Tapscott recently helped kick off the TED Summit in Banff, Alberta, with a lecture about blockchain technology.\n\nReleased today, the video finds Tapscott reviewing points from his most recent book, ""Blockchain Revolution,"" published earlier this year and co-authored by his son, Alex Tapscott.\n\nIn remarks, Tapscott sticks to discussing the technology broadly and in terms that seek to communicate what he views as the coming wave of innovation spurred by the creation of the bitcoin blockchain and digital assets.\n\nTapscott said:\n\n""For the first time now people everywhere can trust each and transact peer to peer.

As it would trade baskets of shares tied to real bitcoins, retail investors have long seen its approval as a boon for the price of bitcoin and the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nIt turns out, though, that even in spite of imminent deadlines that suggest approval may be forthcoming, a real decision could still be months away.\n\nAfter spending two years trying to get listed on Nasdaq, the effort picked up momentum in June when the Winklevoss brothers filed to move their application to the BATS exchange. Within two weeks of that change, SEC assistant secretary Jill Peterson opened a comment period as part of the approval process.\n\nA 45-day period that started with that filing is set to elapse at the end of this week.\n\nBut according to analysts, the publication of the form on the Federal Register didn\'t kick off a 45 day ""clock,"" but a 240-day countdown during which the SEC has any number of options.\n\nARK Invest analyst Chris Burniske told CoinDesk:\n\n""It’s a long and winding road and there’s a big pot of gold at the end of it and we have no idea when we’re going to get there.""\n\nThe clock\n\nAccording to the notice, the SEC had an initial period of 45 days to approve or disapprove the filing. At this point, the financial regulator has the option to expand the period another 45 days, and after that, another 90 days.\n\nAt any time during this total 180-day period, the SEC staff have the authority to approve the rule-change that would lead to the trust\'s formal listing. But that’s just the beginning of the ""clock"" analysts say is ticking.\n\nIf the SEC staff are unable to reach a decision by the end of the 180-day period, there’s another 60-day extension during which the request may still be approved by the commissioners themselves.\n\nIn this case, that’s exactly what Burniske expects will happen, contrary to the sense on social media that the decision was imminent.\n\nSpeculation about the approval date first emerged on Reddit shortly after the initial filing. In the post, the commenters suggested a decision on the ETF itself should have happened as early as yesterday, 22nd August.\n\nDelays and deadlines\n\nHowever, since the form wasn\'t actually filed with the Federal Register until 14th July – six days after the SEC filing — the actual first deadline is 28th August.\n\nIf the SEC is unable to reach a decision by that date, it could extend this particular deadline to 12th October.\n\nBut Burniske says he expects the clock will tick down to a commissioner decision months from now. The decision is just too ""contentions,"" he says, given the newness of blockchain-based assets.\n\nThe fact that the SEC is currently reviewing multiple digital currency applications, and the uncertainty following Bitfinex’s decision to try to recoup the losses of a $65m hack by selling securities, he said, will also likely influence the decision.\n\n""The SEC will allow this to go forward when they feel comfortable and not a second before,"" he said. ""It would be a gold seal of approval for the birth of bitcoin as a new asset class.""\n\nBitcoin boost\n\nSome may question the importance of the ETF, as technically, anyone who wants to invest in bitcoin already can.\n\nBut for institutional investors, there\'s frequently restrictions that they can only buy registered investment securities, according to Spencer Bogart, a bitcoin researcher at Needham & Company and a former analyst at ETF.com.\n\nBogart told CoinDesk that a bitcoin ETF would let institutional investors buy bitcoin while still complying with mandates that prohibit non-registered securities.\n\nTwo things are worth noting about this advantage. First, another key differentiator is that unlike other OTC investment opportunities, ETF investors don\'t need to be accredited. Second, unlike those OTC investments a bitcoin ETF wouldn\'t have a lengthy time commitment, and the premiums would likely be lower.\n\nThe ""knock-on effects"" of the presence of those new potential investors could include increased liquidity, which when coupled with a more diversified investor base, could reduce day-to-day volatility.\n\nBogart said:\n\n""If a Bitcoin ETF brings additional capital to bitcoin, it would likely push the price higher and drive an increase in hashing power and funding for development – both of which would serve to further improve network security which, in turn, further enables all the use cases that make bitcoin great.""\n\nPotential risks associated with a bitcoin ETF include trust in a third-party to manage private keys, in the case the ETF custodian, according to Bogart.\n\n""Of course, that in itself would not be new,"" he added.\n\nComments closed\n\n\n\nOther concerns related to the potential bitcoin ETF were expressed during a comments period that officially ended on 8th August.\n\nIn total, five comments were submitted, none of which called for an outright refusal of the Winklevoss application. But, each presented its own concerns.\n\nSenior Bloomberg LP software engineer and Hyperledger project contributor, Erik Aronesty, proposed that the SEC either require the assets be insured or that the public be allowed to give daily audits of the funds.\n\nOther comments expressed concerns about the auditability of the trust; compared it to penny stock and Ponzi schemes; and inquired as to whether it will be insured.\n\nBut those comments aren\'t the only reservation still being expressed by market observers.\n\nThe head of technology research at Wedbush Securites, Gil Luria, acknowledges with a strong hint of skepticism that the ETF could ""broaden the addressable market for buying bitcoin"". Yet, he sees additional waiting ahead.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""The efforts to list such an ETF have been going on for three years, with no signs that any of issuers seeking approval are any closer than they were back then.""\n\nA representative of Winklevoss Capital declined comment when reached about the timing of the SEC\'s decision, citing regulatory restrictions. The SEC and BATS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nImage Credit: Sky Cinema / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) directorate requested that Sandia set up a graphical user interface or a front end on the Sandia research environment so DHS agents can test the algorithms Sandia is using in actual investigations. The result of Sandia’s work could eventually be delivered to other federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Sandia, adopting a position that is now becoming widespread among financial operators, institutions and administrations, is persuaded that Bitcoin is here to stay and is poised to have a disruptive but positive impact on the economy. The problem is that the potential for anonymity offered by Bitcoin has been and continues to be exploited by criminals to escape detection.\n\n“In many ways, figuring out how to effectively combat illicit Bitcoin commerce and reduce its perception as a tool of criminals can encourage more people and companies to adopt Bitcoin for legitimate purposes,” said Sandia researcher, Andrew Cox, who is leading the project.\n\n“Our job was to understand how Bitcoin works,” added Cox. “Bitcoin is a new, semi-anonymous currency that holds the potential to change the way all sorts of transactions work in a way that might really benefit the economy. Some of the potential benefits include making monetary transactions much more efficient and thereby driving down the costs of doing business, making transaction histories more transparent, which could help both financial markets and financial regulation and, depending on who you ask, reducing the risks associated with inflation and reliance on centralized monetary institutions. All that being said, it has been clear that criminals have been pioneers in using Bitcoin. They use it for drugs, for guns, child pornography and all sorts of terrible stuff.”\n\nA solution is abandoning Bitcoin and re-using specific aspects of its underlying blockchain technologies to create non-anonymous digital currencies with some of the other desired features of Bitcoin — cheap transactions permanently recorded in a tamper-proof ledger. This is the approach followed by “permissioned blockchains” and current plans for central bank issued digital currencies.\n\nHowever, it’s not certain that a permissioned, centrally controlled blockchain could leverage the network effect that powers Bitcoin. Legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo and other experts are persuaded that banks should embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\n\nAnother solution is to de-anonymize bitcoin transactions with blockchain network analysis tools such as those developed by companies like Elliptic and Chainalysis. In fact, bitcoin transactions are not anonymous. The full transaction history of any bitcoin address, including every transaction associated with that address, is permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain and is open to analysis. The illusion of anonymity stems from the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin addresses, which are not explicitly associated with their owners, although blockchain network analysis can often de-anonymize bitcoin users. This is Sandia’s approach.\n\nAccording to Cox, there is no “silver bullet” algorithm to effectively de-anonymize Bitcoin. To do so would involve cross-referencing anonymous data with other, traditional sources of investigative data to identify suspects. “To be successful, the reality is it’s going to take different types of algorithms and additional types of investigative techniques including good old-fashioned police work,” said Cox. “They’re all going to have to be combined.”\n\nThe Sandia team set up a research testbed to experiment with algorithms that can de-anonymize illicit Bitcoin users, including a mix of traditional and novel investigative techniques. Of course, the criminals try to evade detection by using different bitcoin addresses, but the Sandia research results show that known methods often reveal that the same users are using the different Bitcoin addresses.\n\n“It doesn’t mean that we get their actual names because there aren’t any names associated with Bitcoin,” said Cox. “But it will show that some transactions are controlled by the same user.” Then, when one of the transactions is de-anonymized and linked to a criminal, law enforcement will be able to refer back to the rest of the associated Bitcoin addresses they need to deal with. “Our clients are happy about the requirements we’ve developed and the research we’ve done on what types of tools and capabilities are needed,” concluded Cox.\n\nThe researchers are now in the process of generating their own methods by characterizing transactions of Bitcoin users and applying machine learning methods to uncover patterns of interest.', 'Editor’s Note: A spokesperson for R3 reached out to CCN to clarify content from the WSJ article. The patent applied for by R3 is for its software Corda, not Concord, as reported earlier. The article has been edited.\n\nR3, the blockchain startup leading the banking blockchain consortium consisting of over 60 of the world’s leading banks has reportedly filed a patent for its distributed technology.\n\nA report by The Wall Street Journal has revealed that New York-based startup R3 CEV filed for a patent for its software, Corda, on Tuesday this week.\n\nThe patent is said to be the first filed by the largely nontransparent startup, which has gained a reputation as arguably the most publicized private blockchain endeavor in the industry.\n\nUnlike a public blockchain, the Concord platform will be a close-ended private distributed ledger that will only see participation among its approved members. Furthermore, while every transaction with Bitcoin and Ethereum is recorded and publicly disclosed to the public, transactions within the Concord platform can only be viewed by the trusted parties involved in the platform.\n\nThe other notable difference between Concord and prominent public ledgers such as the Bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain is the lack of a digital token or cryptocurrency, with Concord.\n\nThe WSJ report adds that the name ‘Concord’ was specifically chosen for the harmony that R3 hopes to bring and build among its partner banks, many of whom are the world’s largest.\n\nWriting in a blog, R3 Chief Technology Officer Richard G Brown added:\n\nProject Concord is our codename for the overall vision, with Corda as our underlying distributed ledger software.\n\nR3 first announced Corda via a whitepaper in April 2016, as a blockchain solution to improve the existing financial services infrastructure.\n\nThe WSJ report also compared Concord with Ethereum , noting their similarities in the way in which developers will be able to build their own applications over the platform layer. Concord will also support smart contracts, like the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAn early version of Concord will reportedly be released within the next few months, with a select group of banks testing the platform come early 2017. A more robust alpha version is expected to follow by mid-2017.\n\nA spokesperson for R3 wasn’t immediately available for comment at the time of publishing.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', 'The popular crypto-currency Monero has increased approximately 200% over the past week as darknet marketplaces have adopted the currency. The cryptocurrency, formerly BitMonero, focuses on privacy and scalability as its two main use-cases. The recent gains bring the Monero market cap to more than $20 million.\n\nMonero functions on the proof of work consensus algorithm, similar to Bitcoin. Other alt-coins function using a proof-of-stake, a slightly different model. Innovation initiatives are launched by Monero Research Labs, a group of people which includes core developers. One of the most popular uses for the cryptocurrency has been MoneroDice, a provably fair dice game online. This is similar to the role SatoshiDice played in the early years of Bitcoin. Monero, as in part evidenced by recent price gains, still maintains a community of supporters interested in the technology.\n\nMonero’s price increase seems to be on the heels of its adoption as a currency on several darknet marketplaces. Darknet marketplaces became a large part of the cultural fabric after Silk Road, which depended on bitcoins so customers could purchase digital currency.\n\nDarknet Marketplaces have long focused on Bitcoin, but as recent issues in the Bitcoin industry – such as the block size debate and increasing scrutiny on identities behind wallet addresses – it would make sense for the darknet marketplace space to explore alternatives, especially in an industry – alt-coins – where so many seem eager to earn new adopters in order to increase price increase, and thus, more adopters.\n\nAs made clear by the charts, the bulk of price action in the history of Monero has taken place in the past week, but it certainly has had an active price history all time. Year to date, the price of Monero has quietly edged up over time as talk of blockchain and Bitcoin block sizes have carried on.\n\nDarknet marketplaces have noticed the crypto-currencies dedication to privacy and have employed it for their crypto-currency driven systems. Regulators take note.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Could we ever put an end the blight of ransomware?\n\nAre we about to witness a ransomware unicorn? According to Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer of Finnish F-Secure, we are. But there\'s a caveat.\n\nA unicorn is a startup business which has received the valuation of a US$ 1 billion dollars (£757 million) or more. Think AirBnB, Uber, or Spotify.\n\nIn an interview with SCMagazineUK.com, Hypponen explained: ""Bitcoin is based on Blockchain, and Blockchain is a public ledger of transactions. So all Bitcoin transactions are public. Now, you don\'t know who is who. But we can see money moving around, and we can see the amounts.""\n\nBitcoin has not only changed the economics of cyber-crime by providing crooks with an encrypted, nearly anonymous payment system autonomous from any central bank. It\'s also changed researchers\' ability to track how much money criminals are making.\n\nHypponen detailed how F-Secure is tracking over 100 wallets, the biggest of which contains over 12,000 Bitcoins (over £5 million). And interestingly, Hypponen says there appears to be a lot of gangs who aren\'t cashing out.\n\nRansomware gangs have to continually imagine new ways to turn their Bitcoin into currency.\n\n""They buy prepaid cards and then they sell these cards on Ebay and Craigslist,"" said Hypponen. ""A lot of those gangs also use online casinos to launder the money.""\n\nBut even that\'s not easy, even if the goal is to sit down at an online table and attempt to lose all your money to another member of your gang. Hypponen explains that: ""If you lose large amounts of money you will get banned. So the gangs started using bots that played realistically and still lose – but not as obviously.""\n\nLaw enforcement is well aware of the extremely alluring economics of this threat. In 2015, the FBI\'s Internet Crime Complaint Center received ""2,453 complaints identified as Ransomware with losses of over US$ 1.6 million (£1.2 million).""\n\nIn 2016, hardly has a month gone by without a high-profile case such as Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center paying 40 Bitcoin, about US$ 17,000 (£13,000)at the time, to recover its files. And these are just the cases we\'re hearing about.\n\nThe scam is so effective that it seemed that the FBI was recommending that victims actually pay the ransom. But it turned out their answer was actually more nuanced.\n\n""The official answer is the FBI does not advise on whether or not people should pay,"" Sean Sullivan, F-Secure security advisor, writes. ""But if victims haven\'t taken precautions… then paying is the only remaining alternative to recover files.""\n\nHypponen went on to explain the idea of a Bitcoin mixmaster, that\'s not a DJ, rather someone who assists with money laundering. It is an entity who takes money from lots of people and gives back the same amount. The idea is that if someone was attempting to track the money, it really couldn\'t be proven where it came from or where it went.\n\nWhen asked if he could ever see if there will ever be an end to the blight of ransomware, Hypponen claimed that there unfortunately there, “currently isn\'t one.”\n\nHe doesn\'t point the finger at Bitcoin itself, as he says it is simply an algorithm, and not something which can be regulated.\n\nInstead Hypponen highlights the importance of having great backups in place so that when it does happen, you\'re well prepared.', 'The Philippines has one of Asia’s most sophisticated and complete Bitcoin platforms which enables users to settle any money-related bills, payments, and transfers with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin platforms, including Coins.ph, BuyBitcoin.ph and Rebit.ph, are extremely popular in the Philippines because of their simple user interfaces and cost-effective services. CoinTelegraph has used, tested, and evaluated each platform and here is a detailed review of the top three Bitcoin platforms in the country.\n\nCoins.ph\n\nUsers rank Coins.ph as one of the best and well-rounded Bitcoin applications globally, due to its connections with local banks, remittance networks, corporations, and merchants which enable users to do pretty much anything with Bitcoin. Coins.ph allows users to settle utility bills, pay tuition fees, credit card payments, purchase mobile credits, and purchase and sell Bitcoin through remittance branches, ATMs and banks.\n\nOne of its most intriguing services is the 24/7 cardless ATM Instant Payout, which allows users to cash out Bitcoin at the nearest bank ATM at any time of the day without transaction fees. Users can literally visit any bank ATM located in the Philippines and cash out their Bitcoin without any additional processes. A mobile pin number and authentication code sent to your email is all that is needed.\n\nOriginally, Coins.ph debuted as a Bitcoin-based remittance network. To this day, Coins.ph continuously improves its remittance services to make it easier for families and friends to receive payments. The majority of employees in major cities like Manila or Cebu support their families in the provinces with the salaries they receive. The most common method of sending payments around the country is the Lhuiller remittance network, but it charges substantially higher transaction fees and it is difficult to access for those families living in the countryside.\n\nCoins.ph created a service called Door-to-Door Delivery, specifically for families who live in the province so that their familiy member who works in the city can send them payments to their home by delivery networks such as LBC.\n\nOverall, Coins.ph offers 10 Bitcoin purchase and selling methods. The list can be seen below.\n\nThe bank method allows users to select from all of the region’s banks, which total up to 28 banks and tens of thousands of branches.\n\nOne disadvantage of using Coins.ph is its compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations which force users to verify their addresses and government issued IDs. To maximize the daily spending limit, users are required to take a selfie holding the government issued card. Although the customer service is top-notch, it can be difficult for users who are permanently based in the Philippines to go through all the verification stages.\n\nIn general, Coins.ph is definitely the best Bitcoin platform and application I’ve ever used in Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, and the U.S.\n\nBuybitcoin.ph\n\nThe oldest Bitcoin platform and exchange in the Philippines, Buybitcoin.ph remains one of the most reputable Bitcoin exchanges in the country. Its simplicity and minimalistic user interface has enabled the company to keep a loyal userbase for over three years. Unlike many Bitcoin exchanges, BuyBitcoin.ph operates without KYC regulations. That means users don’t have to give up their credentials or sensitive information to buy or sell Bitcoin. This feature of the exchange makes Buybitcoin.ph the most safe and reliable Bitcoin exchange to use in the region.\n\nThe steps in purchasing or selling Bitcoin on this platform is fairly simple. For buyers, Buybitcoin.ph requires an over-the-counter deposit to be submitted on the day of the order. Once the payment is made, Buybitcoin.ph sends the payment in a few hours. Again, the beauty of this platform is that all that it required from buyers is an email address and, of course, the Bitcoin address for the payment. For sellers, Buybitcoin.ph requires a bank account number and the holder’s name for the payment. Once the Bitcoin payment is received by Buybitcoin.ph the payment is instantly sent to the bank account.\n\nThe disadvantage of Buybitcon.ph against platforms like Coins.ph are its limited methods of purchasing and selling Bitcoin.\n\nRebit.ph\n\nRebit.ph is one of the most popular Bitcoin platforms in the Philippines and which has received massive exposure through mainstream media outlets over the past few years. Now under the investment company Satoshi Citadel Industries, Rebit.ph is a remittance and billing platform which consumers in the Philippines use to send both local and intenrational payments, and to also settle utility bills.\n\nRebit.ph started out as a remittance platform. Over time, it acquired Bill Ninja, a Philippine Bitcoin startup which allows users to settle any kind of bill in the Philippines using Bitcoin. The utility bill settlement service became as popular as its remittance platform, which allowed the company to sell itself to Satoshi Citadel Industries.\n\nThe platform is very simple in theory. Users send Bitcoin payments to Rebit.ph and the platform sends cash to remittance outlets or banks in its supported countries list. Currently, it supports Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, the Emirates, the UK, the US, and Vietnam. It takes around two to four days to send a cash payment to these countries using Bitcoin, with very low costs. I have personally sent cash payment using Bitcoin to my family in Korea.\n\nThere is currently no service or platform which replicates Rebit.ph. It is very inefficient and difficult to send global cash payments using Bitcoin due to the requirements of exchanges to send various licenses and documents for authentication.\n\nIn general, the Philippines has a very well established Bitcoin infrastructure and users can do pretty much anything with the digital currency. It requires minimal user information and is very cost-effective.']"
08/26/2016,"['News has come in this morning that Baidu has banned bitcoin advertising on its website which handles almost all of China’s search inquiries.\n\nThe action follows the tragic death of Wei Zexi, a college student with cancer who sought treatment from a hospital found through an online advertisement. Zexi stated in a post before his death that Baidu had mislead him to seek treatment from a hospital that had advertised a treatment researched in collaboration with Stanford. This turned out to be untrue, sending the Chinese internet on fire and bringing to surface seemingly long-held allegations of Baidu profiting from selling forums to medical profiteers and charlatans.\n\nThe storm reached the highest levels. China’s Cyberspace Administration launched an investigation and within just a week had ordered Baidu to “revamp the way it handles advertising results in online searches,” according to the Wall Street Journal. Among many measures, WSJ states:\n\n“Baidu will set up a one billion yuan ($154 million) fund to compensate users who suffer verifiable economic harm as a result of fraudulent information found in paid results.”\n\nThe president of China himself, Xi Jinping, seemingly commented on the matter, stating:\n\n“Web entrepreneurs should not regard clicks as their only goal. Online shop owners should not sell counterfeit or substandard products. Social media organizers should not spread rumors. Search engines should not arrange the information sequence only based on how much they pay.”\n\nWhy Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin has now been caught by the fallout with Baidu apparently not allowing any Bitcoin related advertising. It is not clear why bitcoin has been singled out or whether it is under regulator’s orders or due to Baidu deciding it is more economically profitable to not risk bitcoin related scam adverts as they have to compensate users.\n\nAlthough this may be an over-reaction, we can expect stricter rules in the near future with Baidu most probably working to minimize any liability and delegate responsibility to regulators.\n\nAn established, reputable and regulated company, therefore, would probably be allowed to advertise, but China lacks any bitcoin regulation, so banning financial institutions from dealing with bitcoin back in 2013, leading Baidu at the time to stop accepting bitcoin payments. On the other hand, the Chinese government is very positive towards blockchain innovations, raising an important wider question: why the discrepancy?\n\nA Question of Reputation\n\nThis discrepancy extends beyond China with the wider public, as reflected by the mainstream media, showing a very different attitude towards bitcoin on one hand and blockchain and ethereum on the other.\n\nAlthough some argue the root cause is an attempt by the state to maintain monopoly on the issuing of currency, from a logical standpoint, there is no reason why the state would do so if the alternative is of great benefit to the economic well-being of their nation leading to higher popularity and, in western countries, more votes.\n\nThe state would have to argue with Hayek, a Nobel Prize winner for his theory of money which CCN will cover in an editorial shortly as well as Friedman and Greenspan who strongly argued for private issued currency as money must be under the judgment of the free market if trade and productivity, is to flourish. Moreover, these principles find the support of at least Republicans in USA and Conservatives in UK, and after the failures of Keynesianism since 2008 they might find the support of the vast majority.\n\nWith such strong political allies and principles founded based on the insights of one of the greatest, if not the greatest economist of the 20th century, I personally highly doubt the reputation is based on bitcoin being a non-state issued currency.\n\nIt is far more likely the general public looks in disgust as doctors have to deal with locked hospital computers by ransomware hackers instead of looking after patients, including children.\n\nIt would be understandable if there was a debate or discussion on what to do about such ransomware, although the end conclusion may be that nothing can be done, but even opening such debate in the bitcoin community would lead to personal attacks and accusations of being some government agent or banker infiltrator.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin’s Primary Use?\n\nIn bitcoin’s public forums, everyone openly and proudly talks about bitcoin having a niche in “censorship resistance” – whatever that means in practice considering exchanges are centralized entry/exit points – and how bitcoin is useless for mainstream commerce and far inferior to credit cards or PayPal which apparently provide all you need.\n\nI believe this is the reason why Satoshi Nakamoto left as can clearly be seen by his posts. Reading through, one can see that at the beginning the focus was on the technology with a strong focus on usability and an openness to laws and regulation, but the community slowly changed, coming to a head when many started calling for Wikipedia to accept Bitcoin. Nakamoto intervened and pleaded with everyone, but for nothing as PC World wrote that historical article which, if we take Nakamoto’s words at face value (and we have no reason to do otherwise) directly led to him leaving with his last comment showing resigned disappointment:\n\nIt would have been nice to get this attention in any other context.\n\nHe published what bitcoin code he was working on in a final release and left, never to be heard again.\n\nWith the bitcoin community unwilling to even discuss what measures can be taken to minimize or deter acts that almost everyone agrees are wrong – such as theft or ransom – and with some, including Bitcoin Core developers, stating that bitcoin is not for mainstream use, there is little we can say to Baidu or the wider public regarding its actions except to make it very clear that Bitcoin is sui jeneris and has no relation whatever to Ethereum or the blockchain.\n\nEthereum is Fundamentally Different\n\nThe bitcoin community and the ethereum community are like night and day in almost all ways. The speed and breadth of development in Ethereum is incredible with all projects I have spoken to showing an acute desire to minimize in all ways any potential abuse, especially by criminals who commit acts we all agree are absolutely wrong.\n\nEthereum’s community has no problem whatever complying with regulation with some projects, such as Digix, including AML/KYC at the project’s protocol level. And, as we saw last month, they do not think the rights of thieves or other criminals are above those of honest men, fully rejecting any argument that in any way excuses or supports criminal behavior and willing to take drastic measures to protect property.\n\nBaidu, therefore, and the regulators, the media, and the wider public, ought to consider bitcoin and ethereum on a different categorical basis, treat them differently and have different rules, or rules for one but not for the other because the two share nothing in common and even the code, according to Vitalik Buterin, has almost nothing in common.\n\nBitcoin’s Crossroad\n\nNonetheless, it is sad to see Baidu has placed bitcoin in the same category as irreputable hospitals, but that they have done so shows a clear reputational problem for bitcoin which the community needs to address. Otherwise, it will start slowly losing the support of even its passionate followers, the majority of whom are honest and hard-working people, interested in the potentials of this technology for ordinary men primarily, not criminals.\n\nOf course, every technology has downsides. Cars, for example, have killed many, but, on the other hand, we don’t allow 14-year-olds to drive, we punish individuals who drive while drunk, we have speed limits, and so on.\n\nAccidents do nonetheless still happen, but bitcoin is unwilling to even discuss ransomware or what can be done. After the theft of half a billion in 2014 and $70 million just a few weeks ago, bitcoin’s community has had as good as zero discussions about how to prevent theft, how to secure coins, how to make key management easier. There is no focus whatever on mainstream use.\n\nIt is not just a downside, therefore, it’s a willful choice which leaves us speechless when companies such as Baidu take certain actions towards bitcoin, because, what can we say?\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Beijing based Bitmain Technologies Limited, owner of Antminer series of Bitcoin miners, Hashnest, Antpool and BTC.com will next week launch what it claims to be the world’s most silent multi-terahash Bitcoin miner, and a silent 2600W PSU specially designed for high performance mining. This model is called the ‘Antminer R4’.\n\nBasic description\n\nAntminer R4 is said to use the very power efficient 16nm BM1387 ASIC chip for Bitcoin mining and can deliver a hashrate of 8.6TH/s with a power efficiency of 0.1J/GH and a noise level less than 50dB. Bitmain also claims that at an ambient temperature of 35°C, the R4’s noise level is 52dB.\n\nNishant Sharma, International Marketing Manager, Bitmain Technologies Limited, says:\n\n“The Antminer R4 has been designed with great care to ensure the least possible sound with the maximum hashrate. It replaces the traditional miner fan with a rotary blade system inspired by the fan of a silent split air conditioner. The speed of this fan is automatically controlled to ensure that it never produces more sound than is necessary. The slim design of the Antminer R4 allows it to be conveniently placed in a book rack or computer table at home”.\n\nCompatibility\n\nThe APW5 power supply is compatible with the 220V as well as the 110V mains power supply in North America. On full load, it has a power factor greater than 0.95. With a 220V supply it can deliver an output of 2600W. It comes with seven 6-pin PCI-e connectors but can easily be fitted with 14 or 20 PCI-e connectors. It is built for high-power performance and low noise. Like that of the R4, the APW5’s fan is automatically controlled so it only produces as much sound as is absolutely necessary.\n\nFor home users who wish to utilize R4’s exceptional noise level with the optimum performance, Bitmain highly recommends that they use it with Bitmain’s APW5 power supply.\n\nWith the release of these products, Bitmain says that the aim is to bring Bitcoin mining back to homes and continue decentralizing the Bitcoin mining network.', 'Could a development on the ethereum blockchain help resolve one of bitcoin\'s longest-running debates?\n\nIt may not seem like an obvious question given the differences between the two blockchain networks. After all, bitcoin aims to provide an uncensorable digital currency, while ethereum seeks to serve as a platform for decentralized applications.\n\nHowever, given that a decision made last month has effectively split ethereum into two competing blockchains, some academics and analysts are wondering just that.\n\nMore than a month after the collapse of The DAO, two ethereum blockchains operate, a development that has resulted in a chaotic transaction environment and criticisms that linger to this day as to whether the move that led to this result was the ""right choice"" in response to the challenges faced.\n\nIt\'s in this context of decentralized governance that the ethereum hard fork is now helping to inform the block size debate in the bitcoin community. That debate, which began in 2015, has divided bitcoin users on how best to scale the network to accommodate more users for months.\n\nTo some, the Bitcoin Core development team was seen as too conservative, too worried about the technical failures of a hard fork to take actions that could improve the ability of the network to grow. But since ethereum\'s public struggles changing its consensus rules with this technical fix, sentiment has shifted.\n\nJoe Colangelo, executive director of Consumers\' Research, for example, said that he believes the result ""completely vindicates"" the path taken by Bitcoin Core, the network\'s largely volunteer development team.\n\nColangelo reasons that the conservative nature of the development team, while perhaps frustrating to some in context of a capacity change, has given himself and others confidence in other rules that make bitcoin valuable.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""The intransigence of the bitcoin development community is a feature, not a bug. If it\'s this hard to raise the block size, that 21m limit for bitcoin looks rock solid.""\n\nConservatism rewarded\n\nTo recap, it helps to understand the context of why both blockchain networks needed to consider forking their code, or making a change that would require participants to accept new rules for the blockchain, and how they differ.\n\nLate last month, the development community behind ethereum forged ahead with a decision to push a change to its blockchain that effectively recouped investor losses in The DAO, a smart contract-based funding vehicle that collected millions in ether this summer.\n\nTo do this, all participants in ethereum needed to adopt a new version of the blockchain\'s history, one where the stolen funds were moved to a new wallet for investors.\n\nThis was an emergency measure, spurred by the perceived need to stop illicit actors from absconding with the funds.\n\nIn some ways, issues on bitcoin started similarly, first with the network hitting its capacity for transactions, and then with others calling for action in response.\n\nBut Bitcoin Core, the volunteer development community that works on the code, resisted calls for a hard fork that would boost the block size. Rather, its members have prioritized more incremental solutions like Segregated Witness as mechanisms for scaling the network.\n\nSome argue that the stance of bitcoin\'s developers, while controversial, has been validated by ethereum. Others argue that the implications go beyond that, and could have lasting repercussions for the industry.\n\nIndustry observer Chris DeRose told CoinDesk that bitcoin\'s success to date is the result of a development team that is ""decoupled from short-term speculative incentives"".\n\n""The bitcoin leadership model seems much better geared towards more prudent management of actual users\' macroeconomic issues – despite the, often times horrendously loud, interests of short-term speculators,"" he said.\n\n\'Too early\' to say\n\nAs to what lessons were learned – and whether the hard fork conservatism is justified – other aren\'t so sure.\n\nSome observers told CoinDesk that time will decide whichever viewpoint emerges as the one that informs the larger industry, or if any conclusion can be reached\n\nGil Luria, head of technology research for Wedbush Securities, said he believes it’s ""too early to say"" to draw conclusions from the ethereum fork.\n\nOne potential reason is that it\'s not clear whether ethereum classic, the old version of the blockchain that is now maintained by a new development team, will be able to sustain its early growth and momentum. Traders, those who provide market liquidity for both blockchains, are now debating this question.\n\n""Ethereum has gone into uncharted territory and that community is learning something new every day,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n""These last few weeks are not unlike the early days and months of bitcoin, which survived many challenges and came out stronger.""\n\nJim Harper, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, agreed.\n\n""I think the [ethereum hard fork] will produce valuable lessons for bitcoin and cryptocurrency generally. I just don’t think we can know what they are yet,"" he said.\n\nRight move to make\n\nOthers, on the other hand, viewed the ethereum hard fork as a positive development for blockchains broadly, one that might make even conservative elements of its communities open to change.\n\nInvestor Roger Ver, a bitcoin investor who has pushed strongly for an increase in the block size, argued that the ethereum hard fork wasn\'t the disaster that many observers believe.\n\nBy providing investors with value on both blockchains, he argues, more value was created in the development of two networks, and that ethereum\'s reputation remains largely unchanged.\n\n""The combined market cap of [ethereum\'s two blockchains] is actually greater after the fork than before, so this means that the market valued ETH and ETC more than ethereum alone,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nIn his view, even though the network was split, no parties came to any harm as a result.\n\n“This means that no one lost any money, no one was hurt, and the ecosystem now has an additional cryptocurrency to choose from,"" he said.\n\nVer went on to say that such a move is ""perhaps it is the best option for bitcoin going forward"", adding that multiple versions of bitcoin would provide more choices to potential users.\n\nThe disagreements show that the event is likely to be scrutinized for some time, and that it will, at the very least, continue to inform debate on how blockchain communities can – and should – achieve change.\n\nDecision image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A state judge in Florida dismissed criminal charges against a man accused of selling $2,000 in Bitcoin. An undercover police officer had posed as a buyer, and after making two small transactions, revealed that he (the undercover agent) intended to use the Bitcoin to purchase stolen credit card numbers. The officer then said he wanted to buy $30,000 of Bitcoin. The two met to discuss the transaction, but before it was consummated, police arrested the man. He was charged with running an unlawful money services business, and two counts of money laundering.\n\n“Virtual” or “digital” currency, also known as cryptocurrency, defies easy categorization. Is it money? Is it property? Or is it just some lines of computer code? Digital currency clearly has some features in common with money (also known as “fiat currency,” in the lingo): both have a defined value, can be exchanged for other forms of currency, and can be used to buy goods or services. On the other hand, digital currencies are not the legal tender of any government, and often (but not always) are not issued or controlled by any centralized body at all. Bitcoin, the most well-known digital currency, is famously “decentralized,” meaning that there is no company or government that issues it, keeps track of it, or polices it. Plus, you can’t put digital currency in your pocket.\n\nDigital currencies have numerous advantages over traditional money: contrary to the mass perception that it is “anonymous,” payment trails and record keeping is usually more complete for digital currencies since the “blockchain” (or analogous technology) publicly records all transactions, and transaction costs – especially for cross-border transactions – are dramatically lower than for conventional currencies. For this reason, banks and regulators alike are looking at the technology underlying Bitcoin as a possible infrastructure for all sorts of asset settlements, such as securities transactions.\n\nIncreasingly, digital currency is also being accepted by vendors, of both the on-line and brick-and-mortar variety. For example, the popular mobile app “Fold” allows anyone to buy their morning coffee from Starbucks in Bitcoin, and this very website has previously explained how consumers can use Bitcoin to buy gift cards for retailers such as Home Depot, CVS, Kmart, Sears, and Amazon. Some retailers, like Overstock.com, allow shoppers to pay directly with Bitcoin. So how could a Florida court determine that Bitcoin is not money, after all?\n\nThe Florida court dismissed the charges against the man accused of selling Bitcoin to the undercover police officer, although not for the reasons you might suspect. The court didn’t find that the defendant had been entrapped, or that the evidence he intended to do anything unlawful – as opposed to selling his own property – by selling Bitcoin was wanting, nor did the court find that the prosecution was a waste of state and federal resources (Florida police worked hand-in-hand with the Secret Service).\n\nInstead – and what is notable about the court’s decision – is that it effectively held that Bitcoin is not money. Specifically, the court observed that “[n]othing in our frame of references allows us to accurately define or describe Bitcoin,” and held that under Florida law, Bitcoin is neither a “payment instrument” (under the money services business law) nor a “monetary instrument” (under the money laundering laws). The court concluded that it was “unwilling to punish a man for selling his property to another, when his actions fall under a statute that is so vaguely written that even legal professionals have difficulty finding a singular meaning.”\n\nThis decision stands in contrast to guidance from the federal government, including a March 2013 publication from the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network – the agency responsible for enforcing the federal anti-money laundering laws – that concluded explicitly that for many purposes, federal law “does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies,” i.e., digital currencies such as Bitcoin that can be exchanged for “real” money. In fact last year, FinCEN (as the federal agency is known) settled its first-ever anti-money laundering investigation against a company for selling digital currency to a buyer. FinCEN determined that the company had historically acted as a money services business, and required as part of a civil settlement that the company pay a fine and obtain a license to act as a money services business. (Full disclosure: I represented the company in that case).', 'Customs agents in Finland revealed today that they seized bitcoin and other items worth about €1m earlier this year in connection with the operation of an online dark market.\n\nIn addition to the bitcoin and other ""movable property"", the Finnish customs agency said it stopped about 15 kilos of drugs totaling 10 million doses and valued on the street at about € 1.1m, according to a statement.\n\nThree Finnish individuals are suspected of trying to bring into the country more than 40 pounds of powdered drugs, more than 40,000 ecstasy tablets, 30,000 tabs of LSD, a variety of ""designer"" drugs and pure methamphetamine.\n\nAll three individuals have been in prison since April, when the drugs were seized.\n\nAccording to a translation of the statement:\n\n""The suspects are about 30 years old and a native of southwest Finland and the Helsinki metropolitan area. Customs has made the investigation of the case [in] co-operation with the Netherlands, the US Germany, Latvian authorities and Europol.""\n\nA representative of Finland\'s customs office told CoinDesk the online drug site was named Valhalla. According to DeepDotWeb.com, the site has been in operation since October 2013. Valhalla is still operational.\n\nReferred to as the ""Online Drug Shop"" in the translation of the statement, the shop appears to have risen to prominence in 2014, when its proprietors began marketing themselves by sending out free LSD to potential buyers.\n\nAn earlier version of the site was named Silkkitie, which translates as Silkroad, according to the representative. Due to the ongoing nature of the investigation the agency was not able to provide additional details.\n\nThe site was run via the Tor browser and appears to have accepted bitcoin for payment.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Southwest Finland District Court has until September of this year to consider the full extent of the charges.\n\nUpdate: This article was updated with information provided by a representative of the Finnish customs office.\n\nDrugs and euros image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The integration came as a result of outreach by Steven Zeiler, a local software developer and Bitcoin evangelist, who has also succeeded in getting a local yoga studio he frequents to take Bitcoin.\n\nMatt Carano, owner of The Music Class (which also takes Bitcoin) and former owner of the Pão Cafe, one of the first restaurants in New Hampshire to take Bitcoin and appreciates the ability to use Bitcoin locally, not just through online transactions.\n\nCarano says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“I love that we are starting to see a real Bitcoin presence around the Seacoast region, from brick and mortar retail businesses to service providers. It used to be that Bitcoin commerce pretty much only happened online. I enjoy the more personal aspect of local community adoption, because every time I transact with someone locally in Bitcoin, it reinforces that there are people living nearby who share my values.”\n\nThe Free State Project’s role in New Hampshire’s Bitcoin community\n\nAccording to Mike Vine, technology evangelist for the Blockchain-based content-sharing platform LBRY, New Hampshire’s vibrant Bitcoin scene can be traced back to the Free State Project involvement.\n\nVine explains:\n\n“The Free State Project brought a critical mass of liberty lovers together in a small area and thereby made it possible for us to form a viable community for the first time. One of the many happy byproducts of that process has been the growth of a cryptocurrency haven where you're surrounded by people who understand the potential of crypto and the adoption has steadily increased for years. FSP activists were among the first to embrace and evangelize on behalf of Bitcoin when it debuted, actually introducing the technology to such figures as Bitcoin.com's Roger Ver, ShapeShift's Erik Voorhees, and Lamassu BTM's Harvey brothers.”\n\nThe Free State Project hosts the Porcupine Freedom Festival, or PorcFest, a weeklong festival in a mountain campground with a heavy emphasis on Bitcoin and decentralized technology. Largely thanks to the efforts of the Free State Project movers, New Hampshire ranks as one of the world’s most Bitcoin-friendly places.\n\nPortsmouth as an unlikely hub for Blockchain innovation\n\nA touristy, seaside town of only 20,000 residents in a mostly rural state with a low population, Portsmouth is an unlikely destination for a vibrant Bitcoin community. Yet, in addition to the above mentioned businesses, it is also home to several Blockchain startups.\n\nVine also founded the Praxeum, a Portsmouth-based co-working and community space, with Carano. He sees New Hampshire as a future renowned hub of Blockchain and decentralized tech innovation.\n\nHe notes:\n\n“LBRY is the latest complex organism to form out of the primordial soup of New Hampshire's liberty community. Many readers might find this far-fetched, but I'm comfortable saying that New Hampshire is well-positioned to become a global locus for Web 3.0, along with Prague for Europe and perhaps Tokyo or Hong Kong for Asia.”\n\nArcade City, the Blockchain-based ride-sharing service with a new app slated for release on September 1st, was founded in Portsmouth, and owes its origin to the Free Uber campaign, which protested against the city’s ride-sharing regulations by Bitcoin-funded swarm activism."", 'The dark web has started to embrace Monero, a privacy-conscious alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nFirst, the operators of SIGAINT, a commonly used dark web email provider, decided to host a full node for Monero light wallets. Then, an eight-month-old darknet market called Oasis decided to allow vendors to accept Monero. Finally, Alphabay, the largest darknet market in operation right now, announced the first phase of Monero implementation on their platform.\n\nWhy Monero?\n\nStaff members at Alphabay and Oasis say that customers and vendors have simply demanded the Monero option. “It\'s a lot more secure than Bitcoin, especially when it comes to obfuscation,” said an anonymous member of the Alphabay support staff.\n\nAlthough the darknet marketplaces tend to get negative press, the reality is that many of them bend over backwards for their customers; at least until they (some of them) exit scam. “We have received a lot of requests about it; we\'ve studied the cryptocurrency, and we\'ve decided to implement it,” said an Oasis staff member. “This is what we do when users (both customers and vendors) suggest that we implement or change features. We love to hear back from everyone.”\n\nThe hidden service set up by the operators of SIGAINT acts in a manner similar to Electrum for those who are familiar with that particular Bitcoin wallet. The hidden service allows individuals to use lightweight Monero clients as opposed to running a full node on their own. When visiting the hidden service via the Tor Browser, information about Monero is shown, including the following message:\n\n""The SIGAINT operators firmly believe that Monero is the next logical step in Darknet commerce. It solves most of the privacy problems that plague cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin.""\n\nBitsquare and ShapeShift.io appear to be the two options for obtaining Monero via Tor at the moment.\n\nWhy Not Dash or Zcash?\n\nIn addition to their reasons for supporting Monero, the SIGAINT operators have reasons not to prefer other options, such as Dash or Zcash. In the case of Dash, the site operators are wary of possible collusion by that digital currency’s supernodes. With Zcash, the operators are concerned about the company’s registration in the United States, the fact that mixing is done on an opt-in basis and the possibility of secret inflation initiated by the maintainers of the system.\n\nThe site operators also claim CoinJoin is not enough to maintain transaction unlinkability in Bitcoin. In a Reddit comment, Bitcoin Core contributor Luke-Jr seemed sympathetic to this viewpoint. “Only a fool would use Bitcoin as it is today for darknet,” he stated.\n\nThe staff members of Alphabay and Oasis seemed less inclined to talk about other privacy-centric digital currencies. “Haven\'t read about [them] yet,” said an Alphabay staff member when asked about Dash and Zcash.\n\nOne staff member from Oasis, which runs on donations, made it clear that they’re mainly interested in keeping their customers happy:\n\n“Users requested the Monero implementation; we wouldn\'t have done anything without their request. There are tons of other cryptocurrencies out there and we obviously cannot implement them all. We will always be based first on our users’ feedback.”\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin’s main value proposition is as a fungible, bearer ecash that cannot be censored or tracked, but it’s unclear whether Monero will be able to chip away at the leading digital currency’s nearly $10 billion market cap. The price of Monero roughly doubled in the aftermath of these darknet announcements before coming back down to the 0.007 BTC area.\n\nAlthough staff members from Alphabay and Oasis did not seem philosophically married to Bitcoin in their comments to Bitcoin Magazine, Monero faces many challenges on the road toward more widespread adoption on the dark web or as a store of value. Even Riccardo Spagni, a well-known Monero developer, does not tell people they should buy Monero. Instead, he views it as a place of experimentation for features that cannot currently be tested on Bitcoin. It’s possible that this sort of testing will take place on Bitcoin sidechains in the near future.\n\nEven in a scenario where Monero gains traction on the dark web, it’s unclear if that would be enough for it to become a preferred store of value. Bitcoin still has a much longer track record and a much more liquid market, so it’s possible that darknet market customers and vendors will use Monero as an appcoin more than anything else, even if moving in and out of the Monero system would harm their privacy.\n\nThe push toward Monero on the dark web is a development worth watching, but it’s not the first time a darknet market has accepted an alternative, privacy-conscious digital currency. Two small markets accepted Dash (then called Darkcoin) in late 2014, but the altcoin was not able to gain any traction on the dark web. Time will tell if things will go differently for Monero.', 'The ‘Big Four’ global accounting firms PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Deloitte, Ernst & Young (EY) and KPMG have all been trying to figure out which way Financial Technology (FinTech) is heading.\n\nAs such they have been publishing articles and reports and trying to provide the world with an analysis of where the nascent financial technology industry is heading. These accounting firms are important mainly because they service, in one capacity or another, most of the world’s companies and provide insight and shape opinion of industry leaders across myriad of sectors.\n\nIt is interesting to see how they foresee the impact of FinTech on the financial sector. While some of the ‘Big Four’ think that Fintech might be the next best thing since sliced bread, others seem to take a dim view.\n\nEarlier this summer, they announced a meeting with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants where they are set to discuss the establishment of a distributed ledger consortium. Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PwC will be looking at various Blockchain solutions for the accounting sector just as the R3 Consortium - which has over 50 members - has been doing for the financial sector.\n\nDeloitte - A Party Pooper\n\nDeloitte is the second largest accounting firm out of the ‘Big Four’ and raked in US$ 35.2 billion in revenues in 2015. The company takes a negative view of FinTech overall and see’s the FinTech industry as a disruptor.\n\nThe company has published a report titled ‘Fintech - Disrupting the way we bank’. This report is targeted at the Australian market and looks at how various service providers are putting a spanner in the wheels of the big banks in the country. This includes payment platforms, internet giants, p2p lenders, payday lenders and credit decisioning platforms etc. Interestingly, among the list of disruptors the last names are Bitcoin and Blockchain.\n\nThe report takes a grim view regarding the new kids on the street concluding:\n\n“Typical disruptive scenarios start with new entrants entering less attractive segments and then “bootstrapping” themselves into more lucrative areas as their capabilities develop (as per the PayPal example), so there is a clear risk to banks as their services are unbundled and addressed by niche players with better agility, technology or customer propositions. Conversely, there are reasons why banks are asked to hold capital and why deregulated solutions have been eschewed. Once the first P2P lender fails and people lose money, then it is likely to be a different story.”\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - Drawing Blurred Lines\n\nPwC is the big boy among the ‘Big Four’ with a revenue of US$ 35.4 billion dollars in 2015. They ran a global survey of the top financial institutions in the world and polled 544 respondents. These were mainly CEOs and other executives, as well as the management of companies in the financial services industry. They also got insights and data from PwC strategy and platform which is made up of a 50-member team of FinTech subject matter experts.\n\nThe report they published is called Blurred Lines How FinTech is shaping Financial Services. PwC has identified key trends and seems to think that disruption in the financial services sector will first impact consumer banking and payments. In fact, all major heads such as fund transfers and payments, Investment and Wealth Management, SME Banking, Brokerage Services, Property and Casualty Insurance/Life Insurance and Commercial Banking etc can expect disruption from FinTech in the future according to PwC.\n\nThe accounting firm is of the view that it is customer centricity that is leading to disruption:\n\n“As clients are becoming accustomed to the digital experience offered by companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, they expect the same level of customer experience from their financial services providers. FinTech is riding the wave of disruption with solutions that can better address customer needs by offering enhanced accessibility, convenience and tailored products. In this context, the pursuit of customer centricity has\n\nbecome a main priority and it will help to meet the needs of a digital native clientele.”\n\nErnst & Young (EY) - Reshaping a New Landscape\n\nEY seems to take a kinder view of the FinTech industry. The tone of EY is not one of a spanner in the wheels, the sky is going to fall etc. While they do see FinTech has a disruptor, they see it as an emerging trend.\n\nAccording to EY, which saw a revenue of US$ 28.7 billion in 2015, their survey indicates that 15.5 per cent of digitally active consumers have used at least two FinTech products in the last six months.\n\nIn their EY FinTech Adoption Index they have looked at what type of person is more likely to be an early adopter, where FinTech is really making headway (Hong Kong!) and what the prospects are of the industry. Interestingly the survey also looks at the main reason for not adopting FinTech and that was cited as ‘unawareness’.\n\nEY says:\n\n“While many traditional providers are grappling with how to replace cumbersome, outdated and time-consuming account establishment forms and processes, FinTechs are enabling customers to set up services with as little as one click.”\n\nEY also has a grim warning for traditional bankers. FinTech adopters, according to them, tend to be young, high-income customers and they are the banking and insurance sectors most valuable customers. The writing is clearly on the wall!\n\nKPMG - The Pulse of FinTech is Strong\n\nKPMG publishes a quarterly report titled The Pulse of FinTech. They take a good indepth look at how the FinTech industry is faring. KPMG, with profits of US$ 24.4 billion in 2015 think that there is a considerable growing interest in the FinTech sector.\n\nIn the latest edition of the KPMG report they covered how even though in Q2 2016 funding has fallen by 49 per cent, the future of FinTech is positive.\n\nThey say:\n\n“Globally, fintech is expanding. New companies and ideas, rapidly evolving technologies and innovations in other industries are being used to advance and drive new offerings in the banking, financial services and insurance sectors.While there was a decline in global funding to VC-backed companies, this pause is not reflective of the sectors’ unique strengths and potential for growth; rather, the decline is most likely a result of global market conditions. Even with the Q2’-16 decline, investment into VC-backed fintech companies is on pace to exceed 2015 levels.”\n\nFinTech is the elephant in the room\n\nWe can safely conclude from the findings of the ‘Big Four’ that each and every one of them see FinTech as a trend that will significantly alter the shape of the financial services sector.\n\nWhile some see FinTech as an elephant in a china shop, others see it as the elephant in the room that is obvious and should be discussed. FinTech is basically just trying to do what technology always does - improve the way things are done.\n\nIt is best to put it in the words of James McKeogh, Partner Management Consulting KPMG in Hong Kong who says in the latest KPMG Pulse of FinTech report:\n\n“A lot of companies in Asia are trying to leverage fintech, not from a perspective of disrupting the market, but more from an efficiency and innovation perspective to improve the current processes and digital capabilities that they have.”\n\nHow do you view this elephant?', 'Physical Bitcoins are a fool’s folly. Bitcoin is a digital currency. Any instances of putting bitcoins onto coins are a novelty at best, a rip off at worst. Generally, they have the private key engraved right on them, with a sticker or something similar to protect it. You have to trust the manufacturer to not store the private key. If you give it to someone for payment, they have to trust that you haven’t spent the bitcoin or stored the private key yourself. Bitcoin exists in cyberspace and using metal to store a private key makes about as much sense as a Wikipedia book. Conversion from a new format to an old one erases the advantages and causes a whole host of new problems.\n\nCoinKite is doing something different with OpenDime. Sitting somewhere between a hardware wallet and a physical bitcoin, their product is entirely new. OpenDime is a near disposable hardware wallet with only one use. Anyone can quickly verify its balance and ensure that the private key has not been revealed to anyone, including current and past owners. Users can fill an OpenDime many times, but can empty it only once.\n\nOpenDime is a case-less USB stick with clear glue used on one side to protect the components. Two LED lights and some small components sit under the glue. In the center of the circuit board is a long rectangular hole and in the center of that, a peninsula coming from inside the glue. At the end of the peninsula is an engraving of a small golden padlock.\n\nAs far as physical design goes, they look fine. Their small size, golden contact points and exposed circuits make them look a bit cyperpunk.\n\nThe barebones style looks cool but comes with a cost. While two of the provided OpenDimes had their components completely encased in glue, one had a small hole on one end, big enough for dust and liquids to seep in. CoinKite is trying to keep the price down by not including an enclosure. Perhaps they should spend just a bit more on glue.\n\nIts that little peninsula that makes the OpenDime so unique. When plugged in for the first time, the computer sees the OpenDime as a normal USB storage device. On it are a few files and instructions. OpenDime does not come with a key pair generated. OpenDime’s instructions ask that 256KB worth of data be added to the device. From that, the software will generate a random key pair.\n\nAfter that, the OpenDime is essentially a Bitcoin piggy bank. If the user plugs it into a USB port, the LED lights will flash green indicating that the private key is secure. In a computer, the OpenDime will also display the public key and its corresponding QR code. Users can verify that the private key is secure. Coinkite provides a link to make this easy. Any software that can verify Bitcoin signatures can also be used.\n\nTo access the stored bitcoins the user must break the peninsula. The LED lights will then blink red when inserted into a USB port. More important, it will change the files held inside the OpenDime, revealing the private key.\n\nOpenDime Has Many Uses\n\nThe selling point is a true off-the-blockchain anonymous transaction. Rather than sending bitcoins, OpenDime enables the physical trade of verifiable secure private keys.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to the OpenDime system compared to a regular hardware wallet. Users can only drain an OpenDime once. Traditional hardware wallets are used an infinite number of times. OpenDime’s advantage is that it can be loaded with bitcoins and then sold. Unlike hardware wallets or coins, the buyer can be assured that the seller never had access to the private key.\n\nIn practice, the experience is identical to the ones described in their promo materials. The one caveat to that was that the peninsula took a bit of work – and pliers – to break off. But it being too difficult to break is far preferable to it being too easy.\n\nAt about $15 a piece including shipping (less if you buy in bulk) they aren’t quite disposable. OpenDimes are not suitable for giving away a few dollars, or even twenty dollars, worth of bitcoin. But their price is low enough that it would not make much difference in a transaction including anything more than half a bitcoin. Their website mentions that as their primary usecase.\n\n“We expect most Opendime units to be loaded once, probably with a ’round number’ of bitcoins, and unloaded exactly once in their lifetime. It’s impossible to know what’s happened in the meantime—just like a gold coin that has passed through many hands over the years.”\n\nHow I see myself using it, is as the aforementioned Bitcoin piggy bank. A savings mechanism that costs something to end. The only way to cash in the bitcoin held within is to break the device. Just like the only way to spend a piggy bank without a bottom is to smash it. It’s a large enough price to prevent impulse spending, but not much more than that.\n\nI had given up on the concept of physical representations of bitcoins. Hardware wallets are undeniably useful and every serious bitcoin holder should own one. But something that can safely purchase something by physically handing it over is different. OpenDime’s solution is novel. It created a whole new product type and something that is uniquely bitcoin. It is the first and so far only, successful merging of physical and digital monies in existence.\n\nMy only criticism is the somewhat shoddy gluing technique, and that is truly minor. The price is too high to make OpenDimes truly “disposable” but that doesn’t seem to be their goal. No one will be using OpenDimes to purchase a drink. OpenDimes can be useful in purchasing a car, a house or anything large enough to make 15 dollars trivial. Better still, it can be used to teach children (or adults with low levels of self discipline) to save money.\n\nIn short, it is a new digital Piggy bank for the digital age.\n\n[Note: Coinkite provided review samples for the purposes of this review]', 'There was an outlier among a group of financial institutions that this week announced they are in the process of building a new blockchain and digital currency settlement network.\n\nCalled the \'Utility Settlement Coin\', the project was created by startup Clearmatics and tested by four global banks: UBS, BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, and Santander. But a fifth member of the consortium, ICAP, stands apart for two reasons.\n\nFirst, its team of participants span multiple companies within the market infrastructure provider. Second, as a market infrastructure provider, a digital currency that runs on a distributed ledger could be disruptive to its offerings.\n\nBut, it\'s this unique positioning that ICAP hopes to leverage, not to guard against being made obsolete, but to help inform how a proprietary distributed network might be efficiently adopted.\n\nMichael McFadgen, the managing director of ICAP\'s FinTech investment arm Euclid Opportunities, elaborated on the principals he expects the firm will follow as a more certain timeline for the effort is laid out.\n\nMcFadgen told CoinDesk:\n\n""A long-term vision for market infrastructure based on distributed ledgers is that it has some common layers that the market uses widely. One of those layers is hopefully the Utility Settlement Coin. We will likely be building on top of that.""\n\nThe Utility Settlement Coin (USC) runs on a blockchain platform the group calls the Decentralized Clearing Network designed to let central banks open up their real-time gross settlement service and provide more access to central bank-issued cash.\n\nThough details of how market infrastructure providers like ICAP might adopt the technology have yet to be clearly defined, McFadgen said he believes four principles will likely guide the process.\n\nCritical mass\n\nThe first principle, the necessity of widespread adoption, is reflective of the difficulty of changing the very foundational infrastructure of state financial institutions and convincing other market participants to embrace the idea.\n\n""Something like a USC doesn\'t work if you have 10 different coin designs,"" said McFadgen. ""We plan to be very careful to make sure all the stakeholders are involved and there is broad industry acceptance.""\n\nEven if broad adoption is achieved, though, there remains the additional question of how each of these possible central bank-backed digital currencies might interoperate.\n\nAt this early stage, McFadgen said the consortium has ""not yet thought about how we would interoperate with something like Ripple"", a distributed ledger network that has also seen strong interest from major banks.\n\nHe added:\n\n""There are lots of people looking to implement this type of structure. We are going to need to have an operation with people like that to make sure all our asset are coordinated.""\n\nThe second principle, is the principle of engagement.\n\nYesterday, Clearmatics CEO, Robert Sams told CoinDesk that numerous central banks and regulators from OECD economies have been engaged in the process from the early stages of development.\n\nBut, McFadgen said that an even more diverse group of financial institutions still needs to be engaged, including, buy-side, asset managers, hedge funds and ""any financial institution with a nexus with financial markets"".\n\nThe infrastructure\n\nThe third principle is that of commercialization. But, this term may only loosely define the actual final business model.\n\nAs opposed to a traditional corporate endeavor, McFadgen adopted similar language as Sams in describing the project as a utility that may eventually adopt any of a number of business models.\n\nThe USC project is so early in its development that, in spite of Euclid Opportunities being an investment firm, ICAP hasn\'t taken a stake in the project. ""There is no entity to take a stake in,"" McFadgen said.\n\nThis could be a sign that confidence in the project remains reserved due to the potential challenges it could face with wider adoption.\n\nFor example, if USC is ever implemented, each central bank would have to adopt its own version of the coin, backed by the nation\'s native currency.\n\nICAP and blockchain\n\nThe ICAP team currently working with the USC project includes Jenny Knott, CEO of its Post-Trade Risk and Information division; its newly hired chief innovation officer, Charles Ocheret; and multiple distributed ledger and blockchain staffers from Traiana, its financial markets automation startup.\n\nMuch of that same group has been working with blockchain at ICAP since late last year.\n\nA large portion of ICAP\'s blockchain-related work has been focused on standardizing a post-trade workflow into a ""Rosetta Stone"" for post-trade, that could be easily integrated with distributed ledgers should that time ever come.\n\nBut earlier this year, ICAP also announced that a team of seven employees from Traiana had completed a test with startup Axoni that converted trade data from banks so it could be processed on a blockchain.\n\nAccording to McFadgen, this effort isn\'t competitive with the Clearmatics platform. While Clearmatics is focused on the rails upon which transactions move and the cash that is transmitted, Axoni is working with ICAP to build smart contracts that determine the nature of the transaction itself.\n\nMcFadgen concluded:\n\n""We are involved in many conversations about distributed ledgers and we are going to continue to be involved in those conversations and doing work in research labs.""\n\nICAP logo via ICAP\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Read more...\n\nBaidu, the Chinese search engine giant has enforced a blanket ban on all digital currency-related advertisements. This sudden move on Baidu’s part has left many cryptocurrency businesses surprised.\n\nBaidu was among one of the first movers when it comes to Bitcoin payments. The company used to accept Bitcoin payments from its music service customers until the Chinese government issued an advisory warning against the use of Bitcoin to all financial institutions in the country. Almost three years since the withdrawal of Bitcoin payments, Baidu has now decided to distance itself from Bitcoin and other digital currency-related advertisements.\n\nREAD MORE: Baidu Stops Accepting Bitcoin Payments\n\nAccording to reports, the move by Baidu comes at the time when complaints are piling up against the search provider for featuring misleading advertisements. Some believe that the increasing number of cryptocurrency linked scams is the reason being Baidu’s decision. The ban is also said to reflect the Chinese government’s official sentiment towards cryptocurrencies.\n\nA leading business media outlet reported the development by quoting Zennon Kapron from Shanghai-based consulting firm, Kapronasia saying-\n\n“It could be a precursor to China being ready to push for a more nationalized approach to virtual currencies. it could also be a case of consumer protection as there have been cases of scams.”\n\nThe ban on Bitcoin ads may not necessarily reflect the company’s stance towards Bitcoin. Baidu is one of the investors in the Chinese subsidiary of Circle – the bitcoin peer-to-peer payments platform.\n\nIn spite of Bitcoin being not so popular among the ruling class, the Chinese government has been showing interest in its underlying technology. The government recently announced the creation of Blockchain Working Group, to promote the development and implementation of Blockchain technology-based applications in the country.\n\nREAD MORE: Chinese Government Explores Digital Currency Technology with the Blockchain Working Group\n\nThe Chinese Bitcoin community is one of the leading contributors to the Bitcoin network. A majority of the hashing power is contributed by the Chinese miners. Baidu’s move is not likely to have a huge impact on legitimate digital currency businesses operating in the country. However, its impact on scams and other cryptocurrency investment frauds needs to be analyzed over time."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Cryptsy, Shapeshift, Gatecoin, Bitfinex.\n\nWhat do all these exchanges have in common? More than 130,000 BTC ($73,818,875 at today\'s prices) has collectively been stolen from them in 2016. Hacks and heists at bitcoin exchanges happen so often that it\'s becoming less surprising when a new one takes place.\n\nHowever, just because the routine has dulled the impact doesn\'t mean it isn\'t being felt. When a heist does happen, investors still face significant losses, negative news continues to drive away consumers and new pressures emerge for entrepreneurs looking to launch new products.\n\nJerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, told CoinDesk that these sorts of events make his organization\'s job harder. The non-profit cryptocurrency research and advocacy group, he said, is forced to explain the differences between a compromised intermediary and the security of the core network.\n\nBrito explained:\n\n""Major hacks put pressure on consumer protection regulators who haven’t yet acted on digital currencies to do so, and that pressure can make them less receptive to arguments for a light touch approach.""\n\nAnd with headlines suggesting that bitcoin itself is hacked, it can continue to be difficult for entrepreneurs and advocates to educate regulators.\n\nBecause of the immutable nature of bitcoin transactions, though, and the public nature of the blockchain, bitcoin continues to be an appealing target for hackers, scammers and criminals. Bitcoin\'s blockchain makes it easy to track how much bitcoin is stored on any single exchange and almost impossible for these funds to be confiscated once they change hands.\n\nAlthough that\'s not to say there hasn\'t been research conducted into how these issues could be resolved.\n\nTo help minimize the impact of these hacks, researchers Malte Möser, Ittay Eyal and Emin Gün Sirer have come up with a proposal called the ""Bitcoin Vault"" that they believe would make bitcoin heists more difficult.\n\nSirer told CoinDesk:\n\n""Once criminals get the idea that they might not get away with thefts, we might see a reduction in bitcoin-targeting hacking attempts.""\n\nInside the vault\n\nThe proposal\'s primary function is to give its users the ability to pull their bitcoin back in the event of a hack.\n\nThe way it works is actually straightforward: a user sets up a new address for storing bitcoin, which has been nicknamed ""the vault"". This is an address like any other address, except for one difference: users cannot spend the bitcoins stored there quickly.\n\nWhat a user gains by limiting the speed at which they can move these bitcoins is like a second key, which the team has called the ""recovery key"". In case of a hack, the owner of the vault can essentially undo the transaction, reverting the bitcoins in question back to the owner.\n\nWhen a user a decides they want to spend their bitcoin, they initiate a transfer. They then have to wait a predefined amount of time – set by the user at vault creation – for the bitcoin to become spendable.\n\nIt’s during this period that recovery key can be used.\n\nAssume that a hacker gains access to the wallet and initiates the transfer of bitcoin. They’ll have to wait for the predefined time – which is different for each person – before they actually have access to the bitcoin.\n\nSo long as the victim uses their recovery key during that time, the hacker loses out on the bitcoin. And every time the hacker tries to initiate the transfer again, the user can use their recovery key, thus making it improbable that the hacker would gain access to the bitcoin.\n\nThe ability to reverse transactions, though, has bothered many of the technology\'s enthusiasts, because bitcoin was specifically built not to allow transaction reversals.\n\nThe team behind the vault proposal has no issue with this. With their solution, while the bitcoins are in vaults, they cannot be spent. This prevents a user from buying something with a vaulted bitcoin, receiving the item and then reversing the transactions.\n\nThis will force users to first un-vault their bitcoin (waiting a specific amount of time), transfer the funds to a \'hot wallet\' and then buy the goods.\n\nAction needed\n\nBut while this may sound like an easy way to prevent exchange thefts, the negative media articles and all the baggage that comes with these events mean implementing the proposal is not so simple.\n\nBecause bitcoin was built specifically without transaction reversals, its core software would need to be updated to accommodate the feature. Specifically, there would need to be an addition to the code called CheckOutputVerify.\n\nIn a blog post earlier this year, Eyal explained that while a soft fork could implement the change, maximum security would only be attainable through a hard fork. A soft fork, he said, wouldn\'t be enough, as other means of coercion could be employed by those seeking to conduct illicit actions.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n""The hacker that got Alice\'s private key can bribe a miner to accept a high-fee vault-spending transaction that does not respect the covenant. The miner is motivated to accept the transaction, and then all other miners accept it, too.""\n\nHowever, even if Bitcoin Core wanted to implement a hard fork for this purpose (a move that remains a sensitive subject in the community), there are simply not enough resources to do it.\n\nSirer said that he had exchanged a few messages with Greg Maxwell, one of the leading core developers, after issuing the proposal. The reality was that the team was swamped. While accepting the answer as reasonable, he argued that it was time for the Core team to start prioritizing security.\n\nSirer said:\n\n""It’s true that scalability is bitcoin’s Achilles\' heel, but Achilles had two heels, and so does bitcoin – scalability and security.""\n\nThe team is currently working on a pull request that they expect to submit in a few weeks. However, that is only the first step.\n\nComplicating security\n\nNot all are convinced that enacting this change to bitcoin\'s code actually creates a safer environment as Sirer and team believe.\n\nEric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin Core developer and CEO of blockchain security company Ciphrex, said that the technical implementation would not be difficult. Utilizing a soft fork, the new codes could be easily added to bitcoin\'s scripting language, he explained.\n\nBut, while he said the vault idea was interesting from an academic perspective, he argued that the change makes it far more complicated for a user to manage their bitcoin.\n\nLombrozo explained that a user goes from protecting their private keys to protecting a vault key and a recovery key. Further, they have to then constantly monitor the network to be aware of a hack and have counter-responses in place for when a heist occurs.\n\nThe main function of Bitcoin Core, Lombrozo said, is the validation and relay of transactions and blocks. The focus is on ensuring that the network and protocol as a whole are secure and not how to secure bitcoin at the application level.\n\nLombrozo said:\n\n""The best tools for securing your bitcoins are dedicated signing programs that run on dedicated hardware.""\n\nBitfinex revisited\n\nThe result is that both sides have hit an impasse in discussions.\n\nSirer is confident that, had Bitfinex been in a position to use vaults, it could have saved the exchange from losing millions in customers\' bitcoins. But, Lombrozo said that the Bitfinex heist could have also been easily avoided if they had the correct policy and procedure in place.\n\nHe explained that if these policies are built improperly, there can be loopholes or burdens that result in the account operators ignoring them.\n\nHe said:\n\n""The weakest link in the chain is not the computers nor the crypto, but the people themselves.""\n\nThe same could now be said of those with the power to implement the proposal.\n\nCurrently, hacking a centralized exchange is an easy way for a talented hacker to walk away with hundreds, thousands, or in the case of Bitfinex, over 100,000 bitcoins. By implementing a vault for each of its users, Sirer and his team believe such events would be less likely to occur.\n\nYet, with Bitcoin Core focused on relaying transactions and blocks, the security of bitcoin firms will now rest with their creators and users, who will have to learn proper procedures, create better policies and improve personnel training.\n\nBroken clock image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In the month of April, in spite of having a unique business model with lots of potential, Keza decided to call it quits. The company had announced that it is shutting down its operations and thanked all the users testing its beta application. The users had their Bitcoin deposits refunded without having to go through a lengthy process.\n\nREAD MORE: Bitcoin Investment Platform Keza is No More\n\nSatoshi Citadel Industries has been aggressively pursuing new business models in the digital currency sector. With the acquisition of Keza, the company now has a product that allows anyone with Bitcoin to directly invest in stocks.

However, it is not clear whether the company will continue to focus on US stocks or target markets close to home in Asia.

Funds from the recent investment seem to have gone towards Keza’s acquisition. At present, elaborate details about the terms and conditions of acquisition are not available.\n\nOnce revived, Keza holds a huge potential to open doors for the investors to invest in international markets with Bitcoin.', '“When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over 2,000 years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth (that the government prerogative was necessary) becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters (for a long time including the present writer!) ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.” – Friedrich August Hayek in The Denationalization of Money [PDF].\n\nThe Keynesian response of governments around the world to last decade’s banking crises continues with further money printing announced by the Bank of England. Soon, the FED will probably follow, while ECB continues with its QE. The end result has led to negative interest rates, extreme appreciation in house prices, inflation at 40% in Argentina, an increase in nationalist sentiments, contemplation of potential barriers to free trade… to say nothing of the currency wars, depression in Greece, and a seemingly no way out.\n\nHowever, the insight of Hayek, a Nobel Prize winner for his work on the theory of money and other concepts, reached while he was battling with double digit inflation in Britain more than 40 years ago, provides a solution for which he argued in the strongest words:\n\n“If we want free enterprise and a market economy to survive (as even the supporters of a so-called ‘mixed economy’ presumably also wish), we have no choice but to replace the governmental currency monopoly and national currency systems by free competition.”\n\nThe key insight he reached upon which bitcoin was most probably designed seems obvious once expressed:\n\n“The past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process…only competition in a free market can take account of all the circumstances which ought to be taken account of.”\n\nHayek argued that the solution to the constant mismanagement of national currencies by governments which, in the preface is succinctly summarized as “government has failed, must fail, and will continue to fail to supply good money,” is to allow private enterprise to issue their own currency:\n\n“[M]oney is no exception to the rule that self-interest would be a better motive than benevolence in producing good results… Indeed, [the money issuer] would know that the penalty for failing to fulfil the expectations raised would be the prompt loss of the business. Successful entry into it would evidently be a very profitable venture, and success would depend on establishing the credibility and trust that the [enterprise] was able and determined to carry out its declared intentions. It would seem that in this situation sheer desire for gain would produce a better money than government has ever produced.”\n\nThe Rise of Free Market Tokens\n\nThe current vibrant ecosystem of digital currencies is an implementation of these ideas where thousands of currencies are daily priced by the market depending on changing factors, but they are currently limited in wider circulation due to excessive volatility.\n\nMakerDAO is one of the many Ethereum projects that are trying to provide to the market what is called a “stable coin” defined by Hayek as “in a rough sense…the command over commodities in general conferred by a sum of money [remains] about the same.” He further elaborates by arguing:\n\n“It seems… fairly certain that:\n\n(a) a money generally expected to preserve its purchasing power approximately constant would be in continuous demand so long as the people were free to use it,\n\n(b) with such a continuing demand depending on success in keeping the value of the currency constant one could trust the issuing [enterprises] to make every effort to achieve this better than would any monopolist who runs no risk by depreciating his money,\n\n(c) the issuing institution could achieve this result by regulating the quantity of its issue, and\n\n(d) such a regulation of the quantity of each currency would constitute the best of all practicable methods of regulating the quantity of medium of exchange for all possible purposes.”\n\nMakerDAO implements a version of the above, but instead of using the price of goods as a feedback mechanism it aims to peg the token called dai to a currency basket maintained by IMF as there are, initially, no goods priced in dai. Daniel Brockman, one of the Lead Developers of MakerDAO explained to CCN that an algorithm dependent on price feeds is used to maintain price stability:\n\n“[W]hat the stability mechanism does is to adjust the deflation rate of the dai up or down depending on whether the market price of dai is too low or too high; the deflation rate in turn slowly affects the target price of dai (which is the price used to determine collateral ratios and liquidation events); these adjustments are designed to produce negative feedback loops that induce the market to enforce the peg around the target price.”\n\nThis is very close to what Hayek envisioned, but as MakerDAO is very much at a bootstrapping stage it uses a currency basket instead of price of goods, but MakerDAO is not the only one. Different token projects are already competing to provide the best service in ensuring stability of value with potentially different stable coins used in different regions based on special strengths or qualities they may have.\n\nA new business model has further arisen where companies issue their own tokens to fund their project with the token itself having different qualities while some are no different than a digital currency. We can therefore imagine a Microsoft coin or Barclays coin or Hedge Fund coin or a Teacher’s Association coin with their own different purpose and quality such that some may be considered as just a share, some may be a product in itself, others may be a donation, while other tokens may compete directly to be a currency.\n\nWe do not know how this explosion in experimentation and innovation in finance and technology will develop, but we can be sure there are many challenges. I want to address one because it isn’t often raised, but Hayek attacks it directly.\n\nLegal Tender Laws\n\nThe concept of “legal tender” has arisen due to the state’s millennial long privilege to have a monopoly over the issuing of money. This concept has, unfortunately, led to double taxation in USA, Canada and Australia when digital currencies are used for commerce against all equitable considerations or rational justifications.\n\nThere are legal basis to challenge these taxation rules by potentially arguing that legal tender laws in USA are unconstitutional as they violate Article I s.10 of the US constitution which states:\n\n“No State shall… make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.”\n\nThat, of course, would require a long legal battle or a relocation to UK – the only English speaking country that treats digital currencies like state issued currencies for taxation purposes.\n\nHayek argues that there should be no interference by the government, especially to restrict issuing or treat digital currencies differently than any other currency, as that defeats the point of free market based currency, but if there is to be any regulation I would argue that such regulation would need to take a per digital currency approach rather than apply the same regulation to all one thousand or more current digital currencies.\n\nFor example, a digital currency that is designed to be fully untraceable might require government intervention and Aml/Kyc regulation at exchanges or business level, but a currency that is at the other end of the spectrum might make any such regulation obsolete and pointless.\n\nIt is because digital currencies can be so different from each other that regulators have mistakenly acted both too quickly in imposing requirements while they most likely have little understanding and too slowly leading to the denial of some professional trading functions such as margin trading or futures.\n\nSome governments – which tend to be the least free – have gone further and have acted to ban digital currencies probably due to a misunderstanding based on misguided rhetoric. The free market has punished them by denying them the advances of the technology with those countries now playing catch up, while rewarding other countries which had the foresight to embrace digital currencies as early as 2014 – such as UK – which had its capital, London, crowned the Fintech Capital of the World. This was foreseen. Using bankers as an example, Hayek argues:\n\n“[T]he older generation of bankers would probably be completely unable even to imagine how the new system would operate and therefore be practically unanimous in rejecting it. But this foreseeable opposition of the established practitioners ought not to deter us. I am also convinced that if a new generation of young bankers were given the opportunity they would rapidly develop techniques to make the new forms of banking not only safe and profitable but also much more beneficial to the whole community than the existing one.”\n\nFree Market Oversight\n\nThat is not to say there should be no rules or no oversight. This Wednesday, representatives from IBM, JP Morgan, Consensys, the Linux Foundation and others are to meet to discuss – presumably – the setting up of a non-regulatory body to establish standards and perhaps closer collaboration between the many open source blockchain protocols. The body would be voluntary, but if their rules and guidelines are very sensible and they are fully transparent then market forces would come into play as they have in other industries. Moreover, they would be directly, instantly and constantly accountable as the entire body could easily be rejected by any community or by the entire ecosystem or competing bodies arise.\n\nAlthough, therefore, there may be certain grey areas, the, at times, fierce, competition between different public blockchains, as well as between different tokens on the same chain or different chains, together with the competition between public and private chains, and within each the competition between established tech companies, financial institutions, new startups, combined with the competition between countries to attract talent and capital, the best result for all stakeholders, including governments, bankers, tech companies, developers, investors and the general public will be achieved by the competing free market rather than a state issued currency.\n\nMany laws therefore, especially those concerning the concept of legal tender, require updating or a policy of general non-enforcement should be established if we are to have a solution to the mess created last decade as well as considerably increase the economic well-being of our nations and perhaps start a new golden age of innovation at the scale of the industrial revolution.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Lukas Abegg is a lawyer with master\'s degrees in Swiss and US law. He is currently a visiting researcher at the Humboldt University in Berlin, where he is writing a PhD thesis on a topic at the intersection of law and technology.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Abegg discusses smart contract development within the context of mathematics, arguing that establishing benchmarks like ""code is law"" may place significant stresses on the smart contract concept.\n\nAfter The DAO experiment failed, a heated policy debate ensued about how to go forward with the development of ethereum\'s blockchain.\n\nThe positions ranged from holding on to the immutability paradigm with ""code is law"" as the most important rule to follow, to a more human approach of asking ethereum’s miners and developers what measures should be taken.\n\nOnly little time, however, was spent on the question what a smart contract is actually capable of performing.\n\nBut this very question, I believe, should be at the core of the debate and the respective answer is the only sensible foundation on which a sound policy for blockchain and smart contract development can be built.\n\nSo let’s take a closer look at the capabilities of smart contracts.\n\nNature of information\n\nThe feature of a smart contract is in its very essence the processing of information.\n\nWhile the notion of information varies and no universal definition exists, it is helpful to start with the way information theory deals with information since information theory is part of the DNA of today’s computer science.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to divide information into syntactic information and semantic information. The former being the rules about the relationship between symbols and the latter being the meaning attributed to such symbols (ie: ""intent""). The line between the two is somewhat blurry and telling them apart is sometimes difficult (which, as we see later, lead to the DAOs problem in the first place) but a difference between them clearly exists.\n\nAn interesting piece about the difficulty of capturing ""intent"" was recently written by Vitalik Buterin.\n\nSyntactic information can be parsed and measured (as Shannon and Weaver did in ""A Mathematical Theory of Communication"") and is open to mathematical proof. Semantic information, however, is what a human being attributes to a symbol. It may represent anything a human brain is capable of thinking about.\n\nNormalising semantic information and making it processable is quite a difficult task, to put it mildly. Computer science (in particular artificial intelligence researchers) struggles a great deal in trying to capture semantic information, such as natural language, and represent its meaning in software. To make matters worse, semantic information can be anything from quite simple to very complex.\n\nRather simple and formal semantic information, like a patent for example, can already be processed by computer language. Think a CAD file of a patented widget on a computer that lets a 3D printer print out the exact thing that said CAD file contains.\n\nMore complex semantic information, like the legal notion of ""good faith"" for instance, cannot yet be handled by computer science. To do so, a great leap in artificial intelligence research is still needed.\n\nMissing governance\n\nAnother way of making a distinction between these two types of information would be referring to them as ""dry code"" and ""wet code"", a concept coined by cryptographer Nick Szabo.\n\nTo make a point about why it is imperative to respect that two-sided nature of information, we may look at The DAO. The imperative of ""doing no harm"" (ie: semantic information) was only written on The DAO\'s home page and not in its code (which, for the most part, processed syntactic information only).\n\nFollowers of a strict ""code is law"" doctrine argued that The DAO hacker might therefore keep the drained ether since the ""do no harm"" imperative was only in the home page’s specifications but not in the code itself and therefore not binding. They took their case even further by holding on to the non-forked ethereum blockchain and created a parallel ethereum environment, ethereum classic, which produces some quite tricky problems for users and developers.\n\nIf there had been a proper governing tool that would have dealt with semantic information (ie: ensured everybody abides to the ""do no harm"" rule and provided means to deal with violators), such split would probably not have happened.\n\nMathematical proof and immutability\n\nWhen Shannon worked on the theory of communication, he took great care that his research was confined within the syntactic information realm. That allowed him to mathematically prove his findings.\n\nThat could not have been done if semantic information was involved. For Shannon, mathematical proof was important in order to advance science.\n\nCoding a smart contract does not really advance science and therefore mathematical proof is not important, one might think. However, as soon as you add immutability through a blockchain implementation to your code, you are raising the bar for the correctness of your code to an incredibly high level, if not completely out of reach (cf: more detailed analysis).\n\nSince your code is immutable and cannot be changed, you need to be perfectly sure your code has no flaws.\n\nMathematical proof of your code, therefore, seems all of a sudden quite an important feature to have.\n\nAnd yet, Solidity as used on ethereum for smart contract implementation, is not a language that allows for mathematical proof (ie: is not referentially transparent). It allowed for the implementation of semantic information, or put explicitly, the developers\' intent. The recursion-call that led to The DAO hack should have been used in a specific way, as the developers intended it.\n\nObviously, such intent was not captured by the code and therefore didn’t hinder The DAO hacker from draining The DAO.\n\nIn conclusion: immutability and correctness of code are like the two pans of a scale. The more ""weight"" you put on immutability the more care you have to take regarding the correctness of your code.\n\nNeed for verifiable code\n\nIf almost your entire smart contract is immutably running on the blockchain (like some ""code is law"" enthusiasts envision it to be the only way to go) you are most likely not able to put enough ""counter weight"" into the correctness of your code.\n\nAll of these findings are far from being news.\n\nAlready back in 2002, Nick Szabo wrote a paper about a formal language for contracts, in which he explicitly pointed out that the use of procedural computer language may be tempting but causing more harm than good. This doesn\'t even mention all the existing programming languages that are used in the financial industry or new ways of creating program languages, which allow for formal proving (samples here and here).\n\nEven the developer of Solidity itself, Dr Gavin Wood, envisioned in an early stage of Solidity’s conception a language that allows for mathematical proof and the newest research is suggesting that the translation of Solidity into F* to reach verifiable code would be needed.\n\nHowever, it seems clear by now, that the desired state of alegality, where no engagement from outside a smart contract is needed, is not reached yet. And it will probably still take quite some time to get there, if it can be reached at all.\n\nFilling the technical void\n\nThat does not mean, however, that the concept of smart contracts has failed or would be useless. It just needs an architecture that respects the limits of current technology. And a clever work-around for the gaps in programming language and artificial intelligence that yet need to be filled.\n\nSuch a work-around might lay in the legal system from the classic meatspace, in particular a specific area called Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).\n\nIts purpose is to give two or more arguing parties the formal means to resolve their disputes in private without having to resort to public state-run courts. It provides tools that allow you to set up your very own rules, define the processes of how to manage conflicts, and/or select the judges of your choice.\n\nIt has also the nice side effect of being actually classic-meatspace-legally binding. It is a formidable playing field to explore, eg: futarchy ideas like prediction markets or new value attribution concepts like Backfeed for choosing an arbiter. And it’s not even very difficult to implement such arbitration rules into a smart contract.\n\nJust make sure every user of a smart contract service accepts to be subjected to such arbitration rules, just like you are subjected to privately constituted arbitration rules (eg: the ICANN’s UDRP) when registering a domain name.\n\nHow such a link between smart contracts and meatspace-legal rules might look like can be found here. (These are not ADR rules but contract law rules. The implementation, however, would be very similar).\n\nMoving towards alegality\n\nAt first, it might look odd to use old concepts in order to advance into a new area.\n\nHowever, if you look at it as support structures – very much like a freshly 3D printed item has and which can steadily be moved away when the new item stands in its own capacity – the oddness fades. Even more, such a way to move forward might even have a heuristic element in the sense that it helps to learn more about new concepts and tools of governance that might replace meatspace-legal tools completely in the future.\n\nTo come full circle with the beginning, we should respect the two-sided nature of information and let code process syntactic information and deploy governance tools for human beings to process semantic information.\n\nUsing a governing tool like smart contract specific arbitration rules in combination with the recognition that smart contracts are neither smart nor contracts but rather just verifiably executed code (VEC) may provide a way to test new technology in a less disastrous way than it was done with The DAO and may also provide the certainty needed to make smart contracts interesting for businesses.\n\nAt least until science catches up with the vision of “code is law” and a true state of alegality can be reached.\n\nGolf image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The proposal calls on the establishment of backdoors in encrypted services to “strengthen controls on borders outside of the EU,” “better share crucial information between member states,” and to “fully equip democracies on the question of encryption.”\n\nThe push for greater control over encrypted technology comes after a recent spate of terror attacks in Europe. Both governments claim to have intercepted large volumes of data prior to the attacks, some of it encrypted and undecipherable.\n\nIf successfully established via regulation, backdoors would effectively end the concept of end-to-end encryption, at least insofar as what is legally permissible.\n\nThe EU’s continuing crypto crackdown\n\nThe recent push to crack encryption is only the latest move in a continuing trend by the EU to restrict decentralized technology. In an effort to combat terrorism and money laundering, the European Commission announced a move to end anonymous Bitcoin transactions, placing private, peer-to-peer buying and selling of cryptocurrency under the same AML/KYC regulations as banks.\n\nIn the meantime, Switzerland, which is the home to such famed blockchain companies as Xapo, ShapeShift, and Ethereum, has showed a much friendlier approach to cryptocurrency.\n\nEarlier this year, the Swiss parliament took steps to deregulate blockchain startups to encourage more innovation and business development by exempting them from stringent financial regulations that affect financial institutions. The town of Zug even accepts Bitcoin for certain government services as part of a trial run testing the currency’s viability in public sector applications.\n\nPrivacy advocates hold the line against government pressure\n\nDespite the growing pressure from governments to compromise encrypted services, privacy advocates have largely resisted, and maintained a commitment to encryption. The Tor Project recently released a social contract of conduct for the organization, including a commitment against installing backdoors into encrypted products that law enforcement could use to compromise the privacy of users.\n\nLeakers and encryption developers have faced pushback for their commitment to both privacy and transparency. The most obvious examples of this are both Edward Snowden and Julian Assange living in exile while wanted by the US government, but this treatment has extended to others professionally involved in encryption. The US National Security Agency automatically flags those who search of Tor and Tails Linux as an extremist, while a Tor developer was forced to flee to Germany because of pressure to cooperate with the FBI in an encryption investigation.']"
08/28/2016,"['Picture this: A thief steals millions of dollars by hacking into an investment fund. What if you could just hit the undo button and get that money back?\n\nThat was the dilemma that the creators of Ethereum, an upstart digital currency platform, recently faced.\n\nFounded in 2015 by a group of researchers led by Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin — then only 19 years old — its currency, ether, is the second-most valuable digital currency after bitcoin.\n\nBut the currency suffered a blow recently after a hacker siphoned $64 million worth of ether from investors. In the wake of the hack, Buterin decided to turn back the clock through a software update and reset the entire system to its previous state — i.e., before the hack. The reset created a so-called hard fork, which split Ethereum into two parallel systems.\n\nButerin assumed most users would move to the reset platform, but the fork proved divisive and a small group of users continued using the old system, dubbing it Ethereum Classic and arguing Buterin had no right to reset the platform. That has confused cryptocurrency investors and cast a pall over the future of Ethereum.\n\nIt also opened up a rift between the currency\'s creators, who were the ones to alter the code and render the stolen currency null and void, and dissenters who argued against any intervention — even in the face of an Ocean\'s Eleven-style heist.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nWhile bitcoin is the best-known cryptocurrency, there are, in fact, hundreds of digital, decentralized payment systems that issue and trade digital currencies online.\n\nEach operates on a blockchain, a digital ledger that keeps track of all transactions in transparent, peer-to-peer fashion.\n\nWhile bitcoin did away with paper currency and a central banking authority, more complex transactions, such as setting up regular coupon payments on a bond, might still require the assistance of a lawyer or other third party.\n\nEthereum eliminates this need by incorporating code that allows transactions to occur through so-called smart contracts, which take automatic effect once mutually agreed-upon conditions have been met.\n\nButerin co-founded the digital currency platform Ethereum in 2015.

Technology and financial companies from Microsoft to Deloitte have taken an interest in it.\n\n""Something that was founded by a 19-year-old university dropout in Toronto, Canada, leveraging the resources of developers all over the world, turned into this $1-billion platform,"" said Alex Tapscott, tech writer and co-author of the book Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World.\n\n\u200b The hack and the fork\n\n\u200bBut before long, the digital currency fell victim to an all-too-human problem: theft.\n\nIn April, a group of Ethereum users launched what is known as a decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAO, essentially a digital venture capital firm powered by ether. DAO members were supposed to vote on future Ethereum-related projects.\n\nThe DAO raised more than $160 million worth of ether from about 11,000 investors. Some have called it the biggest crowdfunding project ever.\n\nEther units are mined using high-powered computers, much like these computers mining bitcoins in the Bitmain mining farm near Keflavik, Iceland. (Jemima Kelly/Reuters)\n\nBut on June 17, before anyone could do anything with the DAO, someone found a vulnerability in the DAO\'s code (much like finding a legal loophole in a sloppily written real-world contract), and siphoned 3.6 million ether from the fund.\n\nEther\'s value tanked from a high of $27.60 to $18 immediately after the hack. It has since dropped further to $14.\n\nThe total value stolen, depending on whether you calculate it before or after the hack, ranges from $64 million to $101 million.\n\nEthereum\'s creators weren\'t directly responsible for the DAO, but since the amount stolen from it represented 15 per cent of all ether in circulation, they locked the stolen funds in a ""child DAO"" — a sort of digital escrow — preventing the thief from cashing out.\n\nButerin and his team carried out the hard fork in the blockchain, rolling back the system to a day before the DAO was formed and returning the stolen ether to the original owners. The thief was essentially left with ether unrecognized by the larger community.\n\n""Anything to do with the DAO was reverted,"" Anthony Di Iorio, a co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Decentral, a Toronto-based blockchain company and bitcoin dispensary, told CBC News. ""The contract was changed so that people could get their funds out.""\n\nEthereum Classic\n\nThe hard fork was completed on July 20, but to some users, the move was akin to censorship.\n\nInstead of using the post-fork currency, a small but vocal minority kept using the old one, which currently trades for about $2.\n\n\u200bTo these adherents, ""code is law,"" Di Iorio said. They believe smart contracts should be immutable — even if the intent of changing the code was to restore millions of stolen ether to the rightful owners.\n\nBlockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether and hundreds of other smaller offshoots and alternative currencies. (BTC Bitcoin/Flickr/Creative Commons)\n\nTapscott calls that aversion to intervention of any kind — even by the platform\'s own creators — ""very naive.""\n\n""They confuse governance with government, and governance of any kind with authoritarianism,"" he said. ""There are lots of global resources out there that aren\'t owned or controlled by anyone that have complex governance structures — like the internet.""\n\nCan Ethereum and Ethereum Classic coexist?\n\nTapscott says the co-existence of two Ethereum chains ""causes confusion as to which is the \'real\' Ethereum, which is bad for investor and developer confidence.""\n\n""\'The more the merrier\' is a fine philosophy for ideologues and traders, but for people who actually want to run or build smart contracts, two chains are a mess,"" investor Jacob Eliosoff told cryptocurrency news site Coindesk.\n\nIn a separate op-ed, he argued that if this fragmentation continues, ""the technology we love will never reach a wider public.""\n\nCryptocurrency users appear to agree, as Ethereum Classic\'s price plunged more than 23 per cent in the last week, according to Coindesk.\n\nThe debate around the forking of the Ethereum platform resembles one that raged within the Bitcoin community a few months ago when some Bitcoin developers proposed increasing the size of the blockchain so that the system could process more transactions at a faster rate.\n\nStill, Tapscott remains bullish on the future of blockchain technology, regardless of the ultimate fate of ether, bitcoin or any single digital currency.\n\n""Ethereum is one tiny fraction of the entire blockchain universe, and the universe is barrelling ahead on all fronts,"" he said.', 'Bitcoin and blockchain spaces have received much attention in recent years as investors recognize massive opportunities in the spaces – they themselves can enter into the cutting edge of financial technology.\n\nFinancial technology, in general, has received attention as banks cut down on bank branches, looking to bring their services into the 21st century. Bitcoin has caught a lot of attention but there are key things any investor in the space should know.\n\nFor one, if you’re looking to invest into the Bitcoin space, remain humble. Bitcoin doesn’t actually need your participation. Its deflationary coding will ensure that the idea Bitcoin proliferates. Many firms in the space celebrate the same innovation they’ve made: they all make Bitcoin easier to use. In reality, Bitcoin and the core wallet it’s pretty easy to use anyway.\n\nFor that reason, many Bitcoin startups are redundant. Why, for instance, is there a need for so many wallets? Competition for competition’s sake? And, furthermore, what new features do they bring to the table? Most importantly: how do they profit?\n\nMany of these same concerns can be lobbied at Bitcoin exchanges, as well, who, like banks, must endure cumbersome AML and KYC regulations while buying and trading bitcoins at no more than a 5% profit margin, and much more often at 1%. In total, bitcoin exchanges become the very regulatory mechanisms Bitcoin participants proclaimed to overcome.\n\nTo boot, many Bitcoin users prefer privacy over middlemen. Instead of using a startup like Coinbase or Circle, they might oftentimes opt instead for LocalBitcoins, an early Bitcoin company that allows users to meet in public and trade bitcoins for cash.\n\nThe most pressing need for VC’s to consider in the Bitcoin industry is know your customer and anti money laundering procedures. Currently, due to the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin, there are many questions regarding how the technology might be regulated.\n\nAnother issue facing VC’s in the Bitcoin space has, once again, to do with the laws on the books. We’ve seen issues play out before, such as the case with Charlie Shrem, who took money from the Winklevoss twins – self-proclaimed founders of Facebook – only to be sentenced to prison for two years shortly thereafter for money laundering. He sold bitcoins to someone reselling on the Silk Road, online drug marketplace.\n\nFor any VC’s entering the space, vetting the operators of their company will be paramount. Are the startups they are looking to invest into run by anti establishment libertarian types who might ignore the regulations? Ensuring that’s not the case will prove very important to any venture capitalist on the cutting edge of financial technology.\n\nAt the end of the day, those Bitcoin participants doing the most intellectually and consumer relevant work in the blockchain space are not those show-boating, so patience in finding a diamond in the rough will be key for any investors into the Bitcoin space, and public blockchain space generally.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Germany is leaning hard on drug trafficking over deep web. In a recent development, the German law enforcement authorities have seized over $400,000 in Bitcoin from four deep web drug dealers they arrested.\n\nSince last month, Germany has stepped up its investigations into “illegal” dealings on cyberspace. According to reports, the four arrests were made by officers from a joint investigation group involving the Central Office of Cybercrime and the Federal Customs Administration. The arrests were made after officials raided 6 different properties in Eastern Bavaria a couple of weeks ago.\n\nAmong the things seized during the arrests included 11 kilograms of amphetamine, 1425 ecstasy pills, 645 grams of marijuana, 250 grams of heroin, 175 grams of MDMA and 150 grams of cocaine. They also recovered $150,000 in fiat currency and 72 marijuana plants. The drug traffickers were said to be using an encrypted P2P messaging software, Bitmessage to communicate with their customers. One of the arrest accuse goes by the name of “WhiteDragon” and is well-known in the deep web forums.\n\nDeep Web Sheep Marketplace Owner in Deep Trouble\n\nIn another deep web related news, the South Moravian law enforcement agency is charging Tomáš Jiřikovský, the owner of Sheep Marketplace with the theft of millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin. Tomáš Jiřikovský was arrested last year for his role in enabling drug trade over Sheep Marketplace.\n\nSheep Marketplace gained prominence in the deep web after the downfall of Silk Road. However, unlike the latter, it wasn’t taken down by law enforcement, but by the owner himself who decided to run away with customers’ money. A detailed investigation into the incident is said to have revealed huge deposits into the bank accounts of Tomáš Jiřikovský’s family members. These deposits combined with his recent expenses worth over $800000 led to the identification and subsequent arrest.\n\nCurrently, Tomáš Jiřikovský is facing up to 12 years in prison for enabling drug trade and stealing Bitcoin. His wife is also being charged with money laundering and if convicted, she may face 8 years of jail time says the report.\n\nRef: DeepDotWeb-1 | DeepDotWeb-2 | Image: NewsBTC', 'The US economy could be headed for another recession soon.\n\nBarely seven years after the last great recession, several economic indicators point to a renewed downturn possible in the near future.

These indicators are usually a good predictor of a recession, and investors look to them when gauging future financial decisions.\n\nTo make matters worse, Citigroup now predicts that, in the event that Donald Trump wins the presidential election in November, that could trigger a worldwide recession as global uncertainty rises.\n\nAccording to a recent poll by Marketplace and Edison Research, 71% of Americans view the economy as rigged in favor of certain parties. This view will almost certainly be amplified in the event of a further economic downturn.\n\nThe economy elsewhere may not fare better than the US\n\nWhile the US is looking to be due for a recession, that by no means that the rest of the world will be spared.

The latest report titled “The Fintech Ecosystem Report: Measuring the effects of technology on the entire financial services industry” offers a peek into the future of fintech.\n\nIt paints a picture of the war between established financial powerhouses and startups that are re-engineering decades-old practices. Like any battle, there will be losers and winners, who is who will be decided in the course of time.\n\nAn example of few battles that are part of the larger on-going war includes traditional retail banks against online-only banking systems, traditional lending against peer to peer marketplaces and crowdfunding and traditional asset managers against robo-advisors.\n\nIn all these cases, the newer alternatives are driven by technology, including the blockchain and they require minimal human intervention. The report foresees transformation in the areas of retail banking, lending & financing, payments & transfers, wealth & asset management, markets &exchanges, insurance and blockchain transactions.\n\n“Fintech will soon change the nature of almost every financial activity, from banking to payments to wealth management.”\n\nThere is currently no clear winner at the moment. Both traditional financial institutions and new-age startups are trying to overcome their own challenges to come up with a winning solution. It is a matter of survival for both the parties alike.\n\nWhile the report presents a picture of fintech being beyond one or two inventions, it still refers to Blockchain technology as a trump card. Whether Bitcoin as a currency will change the financial system or not, but its underlying technology is in everyone’s crosshairs.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community doesn’t really need a $495 (0.87 BTC) report to understand the implications of blockchain technology on legacy processes and systems. But coming from reputed organizations, it reinforces the faith in cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology.\n\nRef: Business Insider | Image: Shutterstock', 'The team behind Opera, a web browser developed and released by Opera Software in 1995, may consider integrating Bitcoin after introducing a built-in Adblock feature in its newest release.\n\nOpera’s adblock-integrated browser received positive responses from online communities, particularly for its ability to load web pages 90% faster than other browsers. Because the adblock software is built into the system of Opera, it catches advertisements in the engine when a webpage is requested, enabling users to access the web more efficiently.\n\nHow about Brave browser?\n\nAnother browser to implement a similar concept of Opera is Brave, a web browser developed by JavaScript creator and co-founder of Mozilla, Brendan Eich. The Brave browser eliminates any advertisements seen on a webpage and replaces them with advertisements sold by the Brave Software team. To compensate publishers, the team pays 55% of ad revenues in Bitcoin.\n\nThe Brave Browser team’s release of a Bitcoin-integrated ad-free browser prompted the Bitcoin community to reconsider the implementation of micropayments and consider the possibility of using Bitcoin to payout publishers globally.\n\nThe Bitcoin community praised the Brave Software team for their efforts in integrating Bitcoin and creating another platform publishers to be incentivized.\n\nDefinitely maybe\n\nConsidering the positivity surrounding Brave’s new project, I personally asked the Opera team if they would ever consider integrating Bitcoin with an advertising model for incentives.\n\nWhen asked “Opera team created browser with built-in adblock. Will the team consider integrating Bitcoin micropayment to incentivize content creators?,” the Opera team responded, “In which browser would you like to see this ? Mobile or desktop?”\n\n@iamjosephyoung Hi :) In which browser would you like to see this ? Mobile or desktop? :) /Rosi — Opera (@opera) August 26, 2016\n\nAlthough the Opera team hasn’t released or hinted the integration of Bitcoin officially or publicly, it is possibility that the team might consider integrating Bitcoin in the future as a part of its initiative of eliminating ads on web pages.\n\nSince the Opera team is concerned with the speed of web pages and malware containing advertisements, Opera could potentially integrate its own advertisements that load faster on web pages and distribute a portion of the ad revenues to the publishers.\n\nThe integration of Bitcoin and implementation of micropayments will introduce startups and other platforms to more opportunities of utilizing Bitcoin and other digital currencies.', ""Disclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nA mood of resignation prevails across the bitcoin space as a viciously years-long debate that has taken the reputation of so many and the time and focus of all, seemingly, comes to an end.\n\nEric Mu of HaoBTC, one of the most influential, if not the decisive, mining entity in the blocksize debate, stated today that most miners did not care about the blocksize question and those who do can easily collude/conspire, are easily alienated or cajoled or…. much more shockingly, are intimidated.\n\n@BronxR Speaking from the perspective of Cn miner, most don't care; the few who do r easily colluded, alienated or cajoled — Eric Mu (@muxiaoliang) August 28, 2016\n\nMiners, from remote parts of China, were outed at the “scaling workshop” held during winter 2015 when around 10 individuals were shown to control almost all of bitcoin’s hashpower. Since then, instead of mere mechanical workers, they became political actors (despite lacking much protocol level understanding of bitcoin), in an epic struggle for the future of bitcoin which led to a tragically divided community, a complete standstill in development, censorship and banning, including by Bitcoin Core developers in IRC channels where much protocol level discussion takes place and in the mailing list, as well as metaphorical exiling of prominent developers at a dear cost for all of the digital currency space.\n\nJihan Wu, the operator of one of the biggest mining pool, publicly stated:\n\n“For the growth of Bitcoin, blocksize is a minor issue that cost the community so much damage. It has given too much opportunities for some people who are altcoin developers but also claiming to be Bitcoin reference client software developers…\n\nI think everyone… should buy a mini PC, like Intel NUC, in his home, with 500G-1TB disk and wifi. It cost less than 500$. It is running a full node, so don’t go extreme to try to run it on a 10$ worth second handed RasPi.”\n\nThe Socially Engineered Checkmate\n\nMiners were checkmated on May the 2nd when Gavin Andresen – probably intentionally targeted with a social engineering plot to discredit him – seemingly left the scene or at least became far less involved leaving miners with nowhere to turn due to a lack of an alternative development team.\n\nLikewise, Jeff Garzick – one of the most prominent developers who aided Nakamoto in the early days in coding bitcoin – has been very quiet, as has Jonathan Toomim who suddenly decided to withdraw at the height of Bitcoin classic preferring to give – at the time – no explanation.\n\nScientology Cult Like Tactics\n\nMarshal Long, one of the miners who assisted Bitcoin Classic, publicly stated last month in reply to the announcement by some grassroots bitcoin members that they are to flag day fork bitcoin:\n\n“I am here to tell you that there is a large group that started those forward-looking projects that have left bitcoin due to those people. It’s one thing to say no we don’t like that, it’s another thing to completely try to doxx it away…. Bitcoin is now to the point where I think it has been completely co-opted.”\n\nHe is probably referring to the scientology-like tactics publicly expressed by Paul Capestany (who most believe goes by the nickname of eragmus). A Silicon Valley Bitcoin Meetup Co-organizer who since April states in his linkedin profile that he works for a “well-known startup” which we can all guess, but that he is ashamed to say it speaks volume and tells you all you need to know about both the employer and employee who had the hubris to express this threat:\n\n“Jonathan, Gavin, and Jeff… receive this ultimatum: any one of you who does not publicly renounce your support for the BitcoinClassic contentious hardfork within the next 24 hours will be facing the prospect of a very public, completely fact-based, political smearing campaign.”\n\nThese are very much scientology level tactics. Digg through the trash, try and embarrass people of different opinions so as to silence them, take things out of context, try and appeal to authorities to rigidly apply rules we all constantly break and – most think – are very immoral to enforce where the intention isn’t malicious.\n\nIn short, do all one legally can to silence others. If at times one slips a bit to the unethical or even illegal – such as by staging – well, there isn’t really much of a line so what does it matter.\n\nBitcoin the Cult\n\nWhen buttcoin said bitcoin is a cult, I believe they were talking metaphorically, however, considering the very careful curation of r/bitcoin content, considering the cult like tactics to censor opponents, considering that even miners publicly state they are intimidated, there is no longer a metaphor.\n\nOne would think with blockstream – which signed a “strategic partnership” with PwC (not that it necessarily reflects any nefarious behavior from PwC who most probably wishes to take advantage of blockchain technology) – winning, they would work very hard to become more welcoming, more accommodating, even active to reach out to others and explain, but dinosaurs seemingly never learn.\n\nNo Attempt to Reconciliate\n\nThey won – though it may be a pyrrhic victory – thus I thought to interview any of them that can easily be contacted so we can know where we are going, but, most of them did not even respond, showing a complete lack of care for bitcoin users.\n\nOf those who responded – James Hilliard – aka Lightsword – of whom google seems to know little if anything despite being an active and very influential arguer over months for blockstream – responded to just say he won’t answer even basic questions.\n\nSocial Engineering All Around\n\nI considered this debate over five months ago and wrote an editorial about it, but now that it seems the matter has been conclusively settled, I thought to reach out to anyone I could.\n\nDisregarding Hillard’s refusal to answer anything, almost no one responded – showing a complete sneer for all users of bitcoin – except for, surprisingly, Gregory Maxwell – the founder of Blockstream and employer of many Bitcoin Developers. His very few responses, however, are the most bizarre I have experienced:\n\n<aquentson> Hi, I must say, though we may have some differences, it does pain me to see you attacked and likewise attacking others. I find it highly unproductive at this stage, so, I’d like to interview you if you are willing, to learn of your positions in a more neutral for publishing way, to learn of the vision and for you to address any criticisms, if you are willing of course.\n\n(almost two hours later)\n\n<aquentson> I take it you’re not… thanks in any event\n\n<gmaxwell> You’ve been previously banned from the bitcoin channels here. Your continued intrusion is a violation of the CFAA. I will push for prosecution if I find you in the channels again.\n\n<aquentson> lol\n\n<aquentson> look, I am genuinely interested to interview you on your positions\n\n<gmaxwell> Do not attempt further contact with me, my family, my company, or any of its employees.\n\nI’m sure Maxwell is under immense stress, much of it due to his own (or paid employees speaking under his name) constant engagement of others who just simply disagree with him, but I cannot escape the conclusion that his very bizarre claim and suggestion that using a different nickname to speak or view the highly controlled #bitcoin IRC channel, which of course is no way owned by Gregory Maxwell, is somehow an illegal offence.\n\nIt is sufficiently nonsensical that one can conclude he means none of it and instead he is overtly engaging in outright social engineering by making stupid legal threats to bring to the forefront emotions and thus shut fully down the brain.\n\nIt is, however, good to know there are no olive branches here nor white pigeons flying above. Despite so many attempts to reach an understanding, it is now as clear as gravity that Gregory Maxwell and his like are in no mood and far more keen to social engineer, or, more appropriately, to plunder, leaving escape and exit (to ETH due to their speed and breadth of development that makes it all what bitcoin should have been) the only option, unless you desire the appropriation of your property.\n\nThus, I’ll be happy to ignore fully this man of no background, no linkedin, no transparency, no achievement. And with him too those who by his side fully disregard all common sense and decency, even while they are victorious.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:"", 'Many people associate Bitcoin with anonymity these days. According to most people, it is next to impossible to track Bitcoin transfers. This is a very odd statement, considering how all Bitcoin Transactions are visible on the blockchain in real-time. A new service, called Bitcoin Tracker, wants to make it easier to “track” funds. Although this is just a block explorer, the name will attract some interest for sure.\n\nFollowing Bitcoin transfers around the world is a lot easier than most people give it credit for. With all transactions broadcasted on the blockchain in real-time, anyone can see where funds come from or ends up at. There is no special hardware or software needed, as all information can be accessed through a browser.\n\nDespite this level of convenience, the concept remains strange to a lot of consumers. Such a level of transparency is unprecedented in any financial ecosystem. Albeit no personal information is revealed during a Bitcoin transfer, the cryptocurrency is far from anonymous. After all, with funds movement visible in real-time to the entire world, anonymity is impossible.\n\nBitcoin Tracker Is More Than A Block Explorer\n\nOver the past few months, there has been an increased focus on so-called Bitcoin analytics tools. Companies such as Chainalysis have been making headlines all week. But it is not overly difficult to track Bitcoin transactions by any means. Sifting through all of this data in real-time is a different matter entirely, though.\n\nThe creators of Bitcoin Tracker have probably been thinking along the same lines. Branding is an important aspect of any business these days. With a name as Bitcoin Tracker, the service will undoubtedly gain some interest in the coming months. For now, the service is still in beta, and more features may be added over time.\n\nFrom a convenience point of view, Bitcoin Tracker offers something different. The platform provides a convenient way to follow Bitcoin transactions across a three-pane window. Users can also save “transaction flows” for future reference. Plus, wallet addresses can also be tagged with a name. In a way, this could become the next Bitcoin analytical tool, although it is still rough around the edges.\n\nAll in all, this seems to be an interesting option to look at Bitcoin transactions. The service is easy enough to understand for novice users. With some user interface improvements, Bitcoin Tracker could become a valuable tool. It could also bring more legitimacy to Bitcoin as not being an anonymous option to transfer money.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Financial uncertainty is the last thing freelancers want to worry about these days. With PayPal.me, money is never guaranteed to be yours, regardless of where it comes from.\n\nFor freelancers, the primary objective is to receive funds on time, and in a convenient manner. Bitcoin seems to address a lot of concerns in this regard, as it is a global payment option. But in India, there is still competition from PayPal, as they launched a new P2P service recently. Competition is good, as it will benefit the consumer in the end. Moreover, this goes to show the importance of peer-to-peer payments.\n\nWorking as a freelancer opens up a lot of exciting opportunities. One can work for anyone else in the world, as long as they offer a convenient payment method. International wire transfers are becoming a thing of the past quickly. Freelancers and enterprises are using newer forms of money transfer, including Bitcoin and PayPal.\n\nFreelancers Are Better off With Bitcoin\n\nSpeaking of the latter company, they recently launched a new peer-to-peer payment initiative. PayPal.me, as this service is called, seems to be gaining traction in India as of late. Instead of remembering complicated payee details, employers can make a payment through a convenient web URL. On paper, it makes a lot of sense for freelancers to use this payment option as well.\n\nOne thing the PayPal.me service does not address are the higher transaction fees. Bitcoin remains a lot cheaper in this regard, and will continue to do so for quite some time. At the same time, PayPal is a more widely-recognized brand compared to cryptocurrency. This creates an interesting scenario for freelancers who want to get the most bang for their buck.\n\nAnother issue to take into account are the currency exchange fees. Services such as PayPal will charge a slight premium for exchanging currencies. This leaves the recipient with less money in their pocket unless the employer pays the fees. In most cases, the premium fee ranges between 2% and 4% for Indian freelancers.\n\nMore importantly, PayPal payments can be frozen and reversed at any given time. Financial uncertainty is the last thing freelancers want to worry about these days. With PayPal.me, money is never guaranteed to be yours, regardless of where it comes from. Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, cannot be reversed. Keeping in mind how cryptocurrency is gaining popularity in India, PayPal has to deal with a major competitor in the freelance world.\n\nSource: Razor-Forex\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"
08/29/2016,"['When hackers penetrated a secure authentication system at a bitcoin exchange called Bitfinex earlier this month, they stole about $70 million worth of the virtual currency.\n\nThe cyber theft—the second largest by an exchange since hackers took roughly $350 million in bitcoins at Tokyo’s MtGox exchange in early 2014—is hardly a rare occurrence in the emerging world of crypto-currencies.\n\nNew data disclosed to Reuters shows a third of bitcoin trading platforms have been hacked, and nearly half have closed in the half dozen years since they burst on the scene.\n\nThis rising risk for bitcoin holders is compounded by the fact there is no depositor’s insurance to absorb the loss, even though many exchanges act like virtual banks.\n\nNot only does that approach cast the cybersecurity risk in stark relief, but it also exposes the fact that bitcoin investors have little choice but to do business with undercapitalized exchanges that may not have the capital buffer to absorb these losses the way a traditional and regulated bank or exchange would.\n\n“There is a general sense in the bitcoin community that any centralized repository is at risk,” said a U.S.-based professional trader who lost about $1,000 in bitcoins when Bitfinex was hacked. He declined to be named for this article.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\n“So when investing, you always have that expectation at the back of your head. I lost a small amount compared to the others, but I know of traders who lost millions of dollars worth of bitcoins,” the trader said.\n\nThe security challenge for the bitcoin world does not appear to be letting up, according to experts in the currency.\n\nContinued Vulnerability\n\n“I am skeptical there’s going to be any technological silver bullet that’s going to solve security breach problems. No technology, crypto-currency, or financial mechanism can be made safe from hacks,” said Tyler Moore, assistant professor of cybersecurity at the University of Tulsa’s Tandy School of Computer Science, who will soon publish the new research on the vulnerability of bitcoin exchanges.\n\nHis study, funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and shared with Reuters, shows that since bitcoin’s creation in 2009 to March 2015, 33% of all bitcoin exchanges operational during that period were hacked. The figure represents one of the first estimates of the extent of security breaches in the bitcoin world.\n\nIn contrast, data from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization, showed that of the 6,000 operational U.S. banks, only 67 experienced a publicly disclosed data breach between 2009 and 2015. That’s roughly 1% of U.S. banks.\n\nAmong the world’s stock exchanges, however, security breaches are much higher, with hackers attracted to the large pools of cash moving in and out of these trading venues. The latest survey of 46 securities exchanges released three years ago by the International Organization of Securities Commissions and World Federation of Exchanges found that more than half had experienced a cyber attack.\n\nMoore collaborated on the research with Nicolas Christin, associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University and Janos Szurdi, a doctoral student also at Carnegie.\n\nIn 2013, Moore and Christin wrote a research paper on security risks surrounding bitcoin exchanges when Moore was still a professor at Southern Methodist University. That research, “Beware of the Middleman: Empirical Analysis of Bitcoin Exchange Risk,” was peer-reviewed and presented at the 17th International Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference in Okinawa, Japan, in 2013.\n\nIn the most recent study, the rate of closure for bitcoin exchanges in Moore’s research edged up to 48% among those operating from 2009 to March 2015. Hacking did not necessarily trigger the closure in each case.\n\n“A 48% closure is not acceptable, but not surprising given that bitcoin is a new technology,” said Richard Johnson, vice president of market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates. Johnson has written reports on risk and security issues in the crypto-currency world.\n\nProfitability is a big problem for bitcoin exchanges, with many of them unable to generate enough volume to keep afloat.\n\nBitcoin exchanges overall could be launched for as low as $100,000 up to $1 million, said Erik Voorhees, founder and chief executive officer of digital currency exchange ShapeShift. That is a fraction of what U.S. forex exchanges’ are required to put up.\n\nRetail FX trading platform FXCM, for instance, is required by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have at least $25 million in capital at all times.\n\nRecovering Losses\n\nA key factor tied to the risk posed by exchanges is whether customers are reimbursed after closure or after the loss of bitcoins following a hack. Each closure and breach have been handled differently, but Tandy’s Moore said the risk of losing funds stored in exchanges is real.\n\nIn the case of Bitfinex, which is now up and running after the hack Aug. 2, customers lost 36% of the assets they had on the platform and were compensated for the losses with tokens of credit that would be converted into equity in the parent company.\n\nAt Tokyo’s MtGox, customers have yet to recover their investments more than two years after closure.\n\nExperts say trading venues acting like banks such as Bitfinex will remain vulnerable. These exchanges act as custodial wallets in which they control users’ digital currencies like banks control customer deposits.\n\n“The big exchanges that hold customer deposits are a big target for hackers,” said ShapeShift’s Voorhees, “and unfortunately most bitcoin exchanges store user funds.”\n\nWhen customers’ checking accounts are hacked, there is always a third party at the bank that can step in to deal with the theft.\n\nNot so with bitcoin, said Seattle-based Darin Stanchfield, chief executive officer at KeepKey, a hardware wallet provider. He expects more of these attacks to happen despite efforts to improve security at bitcoin exchanges.\n\n“Unfortunately because of its irreversible nature, bitcoin requires near perfect security,” he said.', ""Central authorities and major financial institutions responded to the emergence of Bitcoin by targeting the development of its underlying technology in attempt to distract the real value of the digital currency.\n\nExperts have criticized the desperate attempts of banks in adopting the technology, describing that blockchain is a euphemism for people that don’t understand Bitcoin.\n\nSince 2015, banks have poured hundreds of millions of dollars in capital and a significant share of their resources for the development of private blockchain networks. In an awkward series of events, the blockchain technology has been referred to as a mystical invention that creates an irrefutable and unalterable ledger for banks and financial institutions to store transaction data and private information.\n\nNot a single working product to showcase\n\nMost notably, organizations like the R3 Consortium have focused on the development of permissioned blockchains, or blockchain networks overseen by local network administrators, for banks to create a cost-free and robust financial network to handle its transactions and settlement of assets.\n\nYet, after three full years of development, banks and financial institutions don’t have a single working product to showcase, which demonstrates the technical and financial difficulties present in integrating the blockchain technology into the centralized IT systems of banks. In other words, integrating a decentralized technology into a centralized system simply doesn’t work.\n\nVinny Lingham, Civic CEO and Angel investor recently described the blockchain technology as a euphemism for people that don’t understand Bitcoin.\n\nHe stated:\n\n@Melt_Dem yawn.

However, experts predict that in the long run, bank-financed blockchain projects will eventually vanish from the financial market and banks will support the development of Bitcoin-focused ventures."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Digital currency exchanges would be covered by a provision overseeing startups that provide ""money transmissions and conversion services"".\n\nThe MAS said:\n\n""The scope of currency conversion activities is intended to encompass the business of exchanging of currencies at a rate of exchange.

For traders who see volatility as an opportunity to make money and are willing to accept the risks, this is great. However this volatility presents a risk for long-term investors, fund managers and businesses who use digital currency for day-to-day operations. The newly launched algorithm for Bitcoin trading, TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price), could save both money and headaches for people and companies not equipped for higher risk.\n\nBenchmarking Your Trades\n\nOn January 15, 2016 at 21:58 GMT (Figure 1), the price for bitcoin was $390. In an hour, it dropped to $365. I’m sure you have your own annoying price drop stories. This kind of volatility creates multiple challenges. First, it increases risk; and second, it makes it difficult for your stakeholders to know whether you are providing them a fair price.\n\nCompanies using Bitcoin for operations rely on the price of bitcoin. If in one hour — about the time it takes for six confirmations — the price of BTC can swing by 7 percent (and it does!), companies need to add a buffer to account for it. Thus, volatility increases the overall cost of using digital currency.\n\nStakeholders care about your Bitcoin trading strategies. This includes the CFOs of firms (e.g. Bitcoin mining firms), your limited partners, suppliers, merchants and customers who are relying on you to get them the best price. Using digital currency is risky enough for customers, and asking them to take on additional trading risk is cumbersome. They don’t ask you to predict the market but they do ask that you give them a fair rate.\n\nOne way to evaluate and communicate your performance is to use a benchmark. A good benchmark averages out the volatility and provides you with a price that your stakeholders can trust. Digital currency fund managers, for example, use benchmarks to evaluate their trading strategies and make sure they are not undertaking additional risk. Payment companies who have inflows of digital currency throughout the day often use a benchmark rate to communicate to their customers.\n\nHow TWAP Works\n\nTo gauge trading performance, many traders in different asset classes (equity, fixed income, currency) often use average price as a benchmark. The two common ways to calculate an average are a time-weighted average price (TWAP) and a volume-weighted average price (VWAP). TWAP is the average price of a bitcoin over the course of a specified period of time and VWAP is price multiplied by number of bitcoins traded, and then divided by the total number of bitcoins traded during a time period.\n\nWhile these benchmarks are great, they are not very useful if you can’t trade on those prices. If you have to commit to a benchmark and don’t have any tools to make sure you can get that price when trading, you are now exposing yourself to additional risk. To solve the problem, we propose a time-weighted average price algorithm which will get you as close as possible to TWAP.\n\nThe algorithm trades over the desired time, either 1, 6, 12 or 24 hour(s), and will give you a TWAP over that time period. For example, if you set the TWAP algorithm to sell 12 bitcoins over 12 hours, the algorithm will sell throughout the period, aiming to get a 12-hour TWAP.\n\nHow Good Is It?\n\nAs good as a safety bar on a roller coaster. Using historical data, SFOX simulated how the TWAP algorithm would perform. We ran simulations on multiple days with high and low volatility. We also ran simulations at different lengths. Included below are two different simulations.\n\nThe x-axis represents specific minutes. At any given minute (time=0), a trader has a choice: she could trade now (open) or in an hour from now (close), or she could use a TWAP algorithm during that hour. The chart shows the open price (price you would get if you traded at a specific time), a close price (price one hour from the open price) and the TWAP price.\n\nTWAP does exactly as expected — it gets an average price. We also included a VWAP graph to show you what the volume-weighted average price during that hour would be.\n\nOur TWAP algorithm comes fairly close to VWAP and TWAP in the simulations. The performance of the algorithm depends on market conditions, liquidity, volatility, time of day and size of the order.\n\nWe also ran a simulation over a 12-hour period, given the option to trade at the beginning of the period (open), at the end of the 12-hour period (close) or using TWAP. Also provided for reference is the VWAP calculated over a one-hour period. As expected, TWAP came fairly close to the average price over a 12-hour period.\n\nWith TWAP, loss aversion bias can kick in. If bitcoin’s price moves +$30, the trader using TWAP to sell would have yielded a lower amount (~+$15) and thus may feel bad about “leaving money on the table.” Average doesn’t always feel good but keep in mind the trade-off yields stability and reduced risk.\n\nWe all want to minimize risk; however, the question is, are we willing to pay the price by settling for an average price? Many of us think we can time the market better than the rest (aka overconfidence bias). No one aspires to buy or sell at an “average” price. In an average, half the time you are on the winning side, while the other half of the time you are on the losing side. That means, given our loss aversion bias, the times when we lose will cause us to feel more pain. The fact is, risk mitigation is important and averages are a bedrock in that strategy. (It’s all risk vs. reward: lower the risk, lower the reward.) Think of TWAP as dollar cost averaging, an important tool to help minimize risk. You can’t predict where the market is going, so why put all your money in at once? If you don’t use TWAP and lose to the full price swing, you will feel even worse.\n\nFor a number of types of investors and strategies, TWAP is ideal — and especially so when trading a large number of bitcoins.\n\nThis is a guest post by Akbar Thobhani, CEO of SFOX.com. The opinions reflected are those of the author.', 'Executives representing the top-level leadership at a range of blockchain companies and projects have signed a letter calling for a new focus on perceived issues with blockchain governance.\n\nCalling themselves the \'Muskoka Group\', the 14 executives include leaders building a diverse set of open-source distributed ledgers, as well as the heads of notable for-profit startups.\n\nThe letter, published today, follows a two-day governance workshop held by authors Don and Alex Tapscott in Muskoka, Canada, one that the organizers said he found participants focusing on the ""big picture"" surrounding the technology.\n\nDon Tapscott told CoinDesk:\n\n""There was a strong sense that we need a rising tide to lift all boats.""\n\nConcrete steps attendees will seek to take include exploring how to fund a ""Blockchain Hub"" using the Global Solutions Network (GSN) program and whether to create a ""network of networks to help coalesce the community"".\n\nSignatories of the letter included Brian Behlendorf, managing director of the Hyperledger Project; Perianne Boring, founder of Chamber of Digital Commerce; Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys Systems; Matthew Roszak, founder of Bloq; Pindar Wong, chairman of VeriFi; and Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation.\n\nAction resolved\n\nAs part of this effort, the group wants to develop a ""roadmap and action plan"" to help signatories better collaborate with ""leaders at the municipal, state, federal and supranational level"" to develop blockchain strategies.\n\nTo help spur that collaboration along, the group also proposed launching a ""syndicated research program"" to study how blockchain tech might impact industry, government and society.\n\n""The world needs horizontal research investigating areas such as supply chains, asset tracking, marketing and management. We need vertical research into industries such as banking, insurance, healthcare, retail, manufacturing and government,"" the letter read.\n\nToward that end, Tapscott spoke out about how governance issues are harming perception of the technology more broadly and holding back wider adoption.\n\nTapscott concluded:\n\n""\'It’s clear that decentralization and self organization should not be confused with disorganization. We need better collaboration and coordination in this ecosystem.""\n\nThe actions follow the notable struggles of the ethereum community following a recent technical change, and amid an ongoing debate in the bitcoin community of how best to increase the network\'s transaction capacity.\n\nImage of the Muskoka Group via website\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Existing in the space between Ethereum and Counterparty, “Antshares is about building a financial system bridging the real-world assets.”\n\nThe blockchain startup behind Antshares, Shanghai-based Onchain, runs the open-source project without owning it, much like the company behind OpenBazaar, OB1. While Onchain, founded in 2014, lists several blockchain-related services on their website, the overarching goal is to build a large open-source community, making Antshares truly decentralized.\n\n- Antshares\n\nWhile there is a passing resemblance between Antshares and asset digitization platform Counterparty, the two are worlds apart in practice, both figuratively and literally. Not only does each have aspects that the other hasn’t fully explored yet, but the two platforms are presented to completely separate crowds on different continents.\n\nIt’s no secret that Chinese bitcoin trade volume dwarfs the rest of the world, typically 75 percent or more of the bitcoins traded at exchange each day trading for Yuan. In spite of the trading dominance, when it comes to the extended economy of cryptocurrencies and other non-exchange businesses in the space, most companies do their business in English, even if they are based in Europe or Hong Kong.\n\nThis leaves a lot of projects closed off to non-English speaking Chinese, and the average Chinese bitcoin user that doesn’t speak English might have never heard of popular projects elsewhere.\n\nHowever, Antshares is far less developed than its western counterparts. There is only one wallet, and no exchanges for the cryptosecurities. The central reason for such a difference in the supporting ecosystem is that Antshares is being designed very differently, and the system is still incomplete.\n\nAn upcoming ‘mainnet’ client will be the central hub of all asset issuance and transfers across the blockchain. Therefore the existing wallets can only send and receive antshares, much like any other cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nOne of the advantage that Antshares may have is the matter of compliance. “Antshares has built-in KYC and AML APIs,” the whitepaper points out.\n\n- Antshares\n\nAntshares could also be compared to Ethereum in the way it runs smart contracts, instead of simple tokens across its’ blockchain. Until the mainnet client is complete you can only read about this functionality in the whitepaper, which describes a rich and vast ecosystem for finance-minded smart contracts to be issued and traded by anyone.\n\nAs with Ethereum, the first token to run on the open-source Antshares blockchain is the platform’s “gas,” a fee-payment token named “antcoins.” There are a possible 100 million antcoins, generated with each block over the next 22 years. Meanwhile, there are the same amount of antshares, the token that is used for asset transfer, which were all generated up front in the first block.\n\nThe current Antshares Initial Coin Offering (ICO), which is also the project's second, has about a week left until they sell out of the rest of their Antshares earmarked for early adopters. At press time they’ve raised 4,878 bitcoins for the 20 million shares, or about $2.8 million, according to their ICO page. Last September a similar ICO successfully raised 2,100 bitcoins at the time, and all funds raised in both ICOs “shall be allocated for the development and marketing of Antshares Project,” according to Antshares.\n\nThe antshare smart contracts are very simple contracts. According to their Github page they were designed for use as smart financial products, and “could be used for recording titles and assets like equities, creditor’s claims, securities, financial contracts, credit points, bills and currencies.” The page explains how they could be applied to areas like equity crowdfunding, equity trading, employee stock ownership plans, peer-to-peer financing, loyalty programs, private equity funds, and supply-chain financing.\n\nDavid Li, head of overseas operations at Onchain, reiterated the point of simplified contracts during an interview. The contracts aren’t interactive enough that they can be used to hack the system, like we saw happen to Ethereum this summer already. “We do not face systematic risks like the DAO,” Li explained.\n\nThey do, however, bestow voting rights for the Antshares platform itself. Since Antshares uses delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) instead of Proof of Work to secure its’ blockchain, users voting on the blockchain’s use is necessary in place of mining.\n\n- David Li head of overseas operations at Onchain\n\nDelegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance attempts to improve on other blockchain security models where “consensus nodes are required to maintain a state table to record current consensus status,” according to the dBFT whitepaper by Antshare’s CTO, Erik Zhang.\n\nIt’s an improvement on the pre-blockchain “Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance” scheme proposed by Castro and Liskov in 1999. “IBM and Chain.com use similar models,” Li told BraveNewCoin.\n\ndBFT takes blocks and votes from all bookkeeping nodes and orders them in a way that they are convinced will constantly achieve consensus on the state of the blockchain. If they’re right, it’s a far more efficient way to achieve a similar security to bitcoin’s blockchain, without all of the mining.\n\nThe mainnet platform will also, according to the whitepaper, have some advanced personal identity features, allowing for instant authentication with existing banking infrastructure, much like digital certificate companies do today.\n\nThe system is also said to be compliant with rules set out by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), as are 38 digital certificate companies in China that provide digital certificates of personal identity. Local rules for digital certifications will need to be followed in each country, but Onchain developers are confident that many other countries will follow suite due to the platforms design.\n\nTo get the asset digitization plans off the ground quickly, some real-world use is being planned from the start, and two partnerships have already been forged. Chinese startups Bitrees and WeLand are the first to start issuing contracts on the Antshares blockchain.\n\nBitrees is described on the Antshares blog as “the first big data analysis service of blockchains/crypto-currencies in China.” WeLand does return crowdfunding of physical products, which involves shipping large amounts of physical products. Both companies will be working closely with Onchain to get the asset digitization process perfected.\n\nThe Antshares client wallet software, which looks a lot like a bitcoin core wallet in Chinese, is still in Beta. According to Li, an English version is currently in the works. The wallet currently requires the latest versions of Microsoft .NET and C++ upgraded on your windows system in order to run, at least while it's in Beta, and it requires users to download the full Antshares blockchain. A mobile client for Antshares is also planned. “It’ll be released at around the same period of time of the mainnet launch,” Li explained."", 'A US judge largely denied a bid last week by Mizuho Bank to dismiss charges filed against it in a class action lawsuit tied to the collapse of defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.\n\nIn a court order dated 26th August, US District Judge Gary Feinerman ruled Mizhuo should face charges related to unjust enrichment and fraudulent concealment in connection with the exchange\'s failure. Despite claims by the bank it had no formal business relationship with Mt Gox, Feinerman found the parties had a ""transactional relationship"".\n\nThe order is the latest to speak to the complex dealings between Mt Gox and Mizuho, including allegations that the bank continued to accept deposits from Mt Gox customers, even as it limited withdrawals, thereby putting additional operational pressure on the troubled startup.\n\nFeinerman wrote:\n\n""Mizuho stopped processing withdrawals but continued accepting wire transfer deposits (and reaping the associated fees) from Mt Gox users. It did so in an environment in which press reports discussed delays of, but not absolute bars to, withdrawals of fiat currency from Mt Gox\'s accounts.""\n\nWhile a number of charges will move forward, the bank did succeed in getting a charge for tortious interference dismissed.\n\nFeinerman, however, indicated Mizuho is likely to move to have more charges dropped. The judge noted Mizuho ""intends to raise foreign law at a later stage in the litigation"", meaning that the bank may seek to invoke Japanese regulations.\n\nThe case is one of several legal efforts to emerge in the wake of the Mt Gox collapse, which fell apart after months of growing withdrawal problems and criticisms about its long-term viability.\n\nCEO Mark Karpeles was later arrested by authorities in Japan and charged with embezzlement. He was released from custody last month.\n\nThe full court order can be found below:\n\nMemorandum and Order by CoinDesk on Scribd\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That’s according to security experts interviewed by The Hill.\n\nThe allegation emerged when a bitcoin user sent money to both an NSA source code account and the seized bitcoin account, but no money changed between the accounts, according to experts.\n\nNSA Source Code Hacked\n\nLast week, a group called the Shadow Brokers claimed to have hacked NSA source code and offered to sell hacked source code in exchange for the most generous financial offer. Hence, when someone sent money to both the NSA source code account and the seized bitcoin account, the action fed suspicion that someone was bidding on the hacked NSA source code with the bitcoin the FBI seized from Silk Road.\n\nSome people are mistaking incoming and outgoing payments, said Wesley McGrew, director of cyber operations at HORNE Cyber. He said he initially made the same mistake. If one does not look closely enough, or is not familiar with bitcoin, the mistake is easy to make.\n\nBitcoin users’ real names and locations are not public, but the transactions among the anonymous accounts are visible to everyone on the public ledger.\n\nNSA Code Up For Bids\n\nThe Shadow Brokers claimed that whoever sent it the most bitcoin would be rewarded source code that was believed to be from an NSA hacking operation.\n\nThe Shadow Brokers released samples containing previously unknown techniques for breaking into security hardware that was referenced in documents released by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The documents also included a software tracking code mentioned in documents Snowden previously released.\n\nMcGrew said the person who sent bitcoin to both accounts appears to be someone who wants to get his name on both ledgers. He noted that the person manipulated transaction data recorded from small payments to the auction account that spells out the lyrics of the song, “Never Gonna Give You Up” by Rick Astley. The song is a variant of “Rickrolling,” an Internet prank.\n\nAlso read: Hacking group claims it dumped NSA-linked files, demands one million BTC\n\nShadow Brokers Raise Questions\n\nThe Shadow Brokers claimed to have hacked a group called Equation Group, whose level of sophistication has led some researchers to believe it is NSA-related, CCN reported. The Shadow Brokers claimed they stole some of the Equation Group’s hacking tools. They publicized the dump recently and tweeted a link to their manifesto against government sponsors of cyber warfare.\n\nThe dumped files contained configurations for command and control servers, installation scripts, and exploits targeted to specific routers and firewalls. The names of some of the tools correspond with those used in Snowden documents, such as “EPICBANANA” or “BANANAGLEE.”\n\nSome security experts said the dump could be a hoax. Others said more analysis is needed.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The first ever Bitfilm movie competition starts on Steemit today. The users of this decentralzied social network can vote for movies they like the most.\n\nWhy on Steemit?\n\nSteemit is one of the first decentralized social network where you can earn money by posting good content online.\n\nUnlike Reddit or Facebook - that they also have a heavy censorship, this blockchain-related platform uses a currency, called “Steem” (its value is around $0.23 per unit) to fund authors of the best content. Users, in fact, can donate a tip to the authors and let them earn online.\n\nSteemit is similar to PaymeaBit, but that one allows only Bitcoin payments, as the currency has a stronger value and popularity.\n\nAaron Koenig, whose company Bitfilm is organizing the competition, says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“We always like to try out new things and Steemit seems really interesting. It can be a great new way for film makers to earn some money for their work. As we have been organising online film competitions for many years, it was a natural thing for us to do. I think Steemit is a very good way to familiarise new people with digital, decentralised money. Bitcoin has always been a bit geeky, Steem is much more accessible to normal people. You don\'t need to mine or invest, you can earn Steem just by writing about the things you are passionate about. I have no idea whether this will really work in the long run, but the concept is clever, and it\'s great to be part of it in its very early stage.”\n\nEarlier today, Koenig announced on Twitter:\n\nWe will launch our new film competition ""Bitfilm of the Day"" on Steemit today at 7pm CEThttps://t.co/3c7xdkvqQ1 pic.twitter.com/DjZMqvVQyt — Aaron Koenig (@aaron_koenig) August 29, 2016\n\nWhat is this competition about?\n\nEvery week day Bitfilm will present a film and users can watch and vote for it. People can vote only once during the first day after the film’s launch and all the “steem” collected will go into a jackpot to award the best Bitfilm of the Week that will get 70% of the Steem jackpot.\n\nAfter three months, all the weekly winners will compete for the title Bitfilm of the Season.\n\nIn the beginning, Bitfilm will present movies who won the Bitfilm Festival back in February, but film makers can send their movies to participate.\n\nKoenig explains:']"
08/30/2016,"['The best that can be said about bitcoin right now is that it still exists.\n\nSplit by internal divisions while its most useful aspects are harvested by the very financial behemoths it once hoped to destroy, bitcoin is fast becoming the tech world’s version of Waiting for Godot, wherein a hermetically sealed community squabbles and bickers over arcane points of code and law as their world slowly crumbles around them. In the last 12 months, attempts made to produce a road map for the cryptocurrency’s future have come to naught, all while core developers abandon the project and opaque Chinese mining concerns wield outlandish power.\n\nWelcome to today’s bitcoin—a phenomenon so internally focused that its advocates have barely noticed the battle has already been lost.\n\nBack at its inception, the conversation around the currency was driven by an almost unconscionable optimism. This wasn’t simply a mechanism for the easy transfer of capital: This was a tool by which the entire international financial system could be made anew, with corrupt central banks, inflationary currencies, and immoral stockbrokers consigned to the dustbin of history. In a world still reeling from the chaos of the global financial crisis, bitcoin seemed less like a currency and more like a way of future-proofing the global economy from ever having to deal with something so awful again.\n\nThe bitcoin boom of late 2013 brought greater mainstream attention to the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s value surged from $200 to $1,200 over the space of a few weeks, temporarily rendering it more valuable than gold. This was to be a short-lived state of affairs, however, as a string of scandals, hacks, exchange collapses, and—dare I say it—common sense brought the price of bitcoin plummeting back to Earth. Cue three years of stagnation and false promise, as bitcoin has struggled to prove its use for, well … anything, really. Even after all this time, bitcoin is still an economy driven almost entirely by potential—by the dream that, one day soon, bitcoin will become the lingua franca of the global economic order.\n\nBut bitcoin’s spike and crash did have one unintended effect: It shone a bright light on a delicate, still-evolving financial ecosystem and shouted to the world, “There’s gold in them thar hills!” While the currency itself struggled to rediscover the magic of that first almighty explosion in 2013, the circling sharks of international finance spotted opportunity. Soon bitcoin seemed primarily valuable for its blockchain, the distributed, unalterable public ledger that allows it to operate without trusted intermediaries. If bitcoin is the power grid, blockchain is the electricity giving it life. But electricity doesn’t need to be bound to a particular power grid—you can find ways to create your own.\n\nAt least in the early days, the shift seemed largely semantic; a question of emphasis. But as time wore on, the discussion surrounding bitcoin increasingly became focused on how banks, governments, and financial systems could create or use their own blockchains, of which bitcoin would be, at best, an incidental part.\n\nThe revolution heralded by bitcoin now looks more likely to be transactional rather than transformational. Soon, Nasdaq, the world’s second-largest stock exchange, had declared 2015 to be the “year of the blockchain.” They even created their very own blockchain-enabled trading platform, Nasdaq Linq. The momentum has continued to build: A company called R3CEV is working with a consortium of 45 of the world’s most powerful banks and investment firms to create a modified blockchain that would allow companies to pick and choose what information they actually decentralize and what they keep held tight. Meanwhile, the Linux Foundation has joined forces with a who’s-who of the tech and business worlds to create the Hyperledger Project, an open-source attempt to find new use cases for blockchain technology. Goldman Sachs has even patented its very own cryptocurrency, SETLcoin, to permit the instantaneous execution of trades on the stock market.\n\nOne thing that links all of these projects? None of them use the word bitcoin.\n\nFor these financial behemoths, the appeal of the blockchain is obvious. Companies spend an inordinate amount of money on the intermediaries that facilitate the flow of capital between markets. Blockchain technology offers the possibility of those issues being delegated to a few lines of immutable computer code that, by their very nature, guarantee the legitimacy of the transaction. Vast swathes of complex transnational banking and investment apparatus could be rendered obsolete in a few comparatively minor technological adjustments.\n\nBitcoin may be the platform on which this coming blockchain boom operates, or it may not. I imagine this will depend on some purely economic calculations being done by unfathomably vast and powerful financial institutions. In comparison to the almost $5 trillion traded on the international currency markets each and every day, bitcoin’s $10 billion market cap is next best thing to a rounding error. It could vanish entirely and only a small cadre of true believers (and high-end drug dealers) would even mark its passing.\n\nWhat does seem certain is that the revolution heralded by bitcoin now looks more likely to be transactional rather than transformational. Don’t get me wrong: I think bitcoin is a fundamentally useful thing. Its myriad advantages over fiat currency would seem to demand its widespread adoption. But at a basic level, bitcoin is trying to disrupt money. As it turns out, this may be like trying to refashion water, or the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nAnd like so many technologically disrupted fields before it, the promise of great change has given way to the reality of great consolidation. Whereas we once dreamed of a flat, universal currency with an equal value for all players, irrespective of size, now we face the reality of an international financial system that’s almost entirely the same—just with a new coat of paint.\n\nTechnological innovations of all stripes have long wrestled with a tension between revolution and legitimacy, and bitcoin has perhaps felt the tension more keenly than most. To put the dilemma another way: Is bitcoin trying to replace the international economic order, or work within it? Does it want to destroy Goldman Sachs, or be bought by it? To many within the movement, this is still an active question. But as the shadows lengthen on bitcoin’s moment in the sun, it’s increasingly hard to believe in its initial promise of changing money for good.\n\nYou can follow Luke on Twitter at @lukeayresryan.

The watermark can then be tracked on the blockchain with the idea of recognizing and identifying infringements when the media leaves the original recipient or buyer of the media.\n\nThe watermark is an identifying code unique to each user purchasing the media. This code can be used to access a “finder’s fee”, a deposit in the form of cryptocurrency. If and when the content is shared or leaked, the third-party gains possession of the media can cash in the code, for the finder’s fee. At this point, an alert is triggered toward the content producer, who can then check the bitcoin blockchain ledger to discover the source of the leak.\n\nAs a nod to the technology and the idea, the Stellenbosch-based startup has already seen funding from the TIA in the past, to the tune of R500,000. The TIA, a government initiative set up by the South African government grants financial support through various funds for a variety of businesses and institutions, along with Small Medium Micro Sized Enterprises (SMMEs).\n\nCustos CEO G-J van Rooyen stated:\n\nTIS has again shown their commitment to support early-stage technology business in South Africa. The funding agreement will allow Custos to accelerate product development, while simultaneously freeing up resources to spend on bringing the product to the widest possible market.\n\nThe newest cash injection follows a seed funding round in April 2016 where the blockchain-startup raised $265,000 from prolific industry investor Digital Currency Group (DCG) and a South African private investor. Prior to that, Custos raised an initial investment of R2,100,000 last year from Innovus Technology Transfer. Altogether, the company has, so far, raised some 12 million rand (over $800,000).\n\nSpeaking to CCN in the past, Custos chief operating officer Fred Lutz revealed that the South African company’s ultimate goal is to target Hollywood, to see major movie studios among its client list.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Following his TED talk, the co-author of Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World says that what Blockchain needs now for its potential to be maximized isn’t publicity but clarity.\n\nDon Tapscott, who along with his son, Alex, wrote about the Blockchain and how it might change the world, thinks the confusion surrounding the technology needs explanation.\n\nHe tells CoinTelegraph:\n\n“It reminds me of 25 years ago when similar confusion existed about the Web. There was no language to talk about things, let alone clear taxonomies, frameworks, strong use cases and tools to go forward. I played a role then de-obfuscating the first year of the Internet and lots of good concepts came out of our work — The Digital Economy, The Digital Divide, The Net Generation, The Business Web, The Extended Enterprise, and many more. It is my intention to be helpful this time around as well.”\n\nBlockchain mythbusters\n\nAlex Tapscott added that clarity is necessary because there are too many myths about the technology that need to be busted.\n\nHe states:\n\n“For example – people assume this will only impact financial services, or that governments are hostile towards it, or that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are only used by criminals. It turns out that not only are those notions completely false, often the inverse is true. Getting hung up on these misconceptions prevents people from seeing the awesome power of this technology.”\n\nThe authors say they believe Blockchain represents nothing short of the second generation of the internet of value that gives the world another kick to transform the economic power grid and the old order of human affairs for the better. This is particularly important because the world is moving from an internet of information to an internet of value and that holds vast promise.\n\nTED Talk about Blockchain\n\nDon Tapscott’s recent 18-minute TED talk, which he says took him and Alex a couple of years to prepare for, has been viewed by over 200,000 people in less than a week.\n\nThe number of views indicate quite a large interest from people outside the industry to better understand what the technology might mean to their jobs, lives etc. The message has started generating helpful discussions and action among the audience who comprise business executives, government leaders and a wider audience who have “a stake in the future of civilization – i.e. 7.5 billion people” as the Tapscotts put it.\n\nInterest in Blockchain is spreading like wildfire\n\nDon Tapscott says to CoinTelegraph that there has been a huge change in 2016 alone. Unlike last year when about 10% of an audience would say they have heard about Blockchain, a large majority of most audiences now do.\n\n“That’s the progress,” he says. “But when you reflect on the diffusion of the first era of the Internet and its ubiquity, today that’s just a beginning.”\n\nAlex Tapscott adds that excitement and interest in this subject is spreading like wildfire beyond the world of technology and banking to the media, government, civil society, and every other institution in society.\n\nCan Bitcoin bask in the reflected glory of its tech?\n\nFact-based and educational information about the Blockchain is sure to be helpful in moving the ball forward.\n\nAlex Tapscott concludes:', 'The Octopocket team are members of a Bitcoin Association in Spain called avalbit.org. They love bitcoin and do monthly meetups to introduce people to blockchain technology.\n\nThe project believes that practice is more important than theory, and they want to make their platform as simple to use – and access – as possible.\n\nManual Sales, the system architect at Octopocket said:\n\nSo simple wallets are welcome by newcomers, people should not be worrying about losing their keys or passwords. Apps are also becoming a barrier for bitcoin adoption – people get tired of using apps for just trying something. People don’t want to exhaust their data plan downloading an app or don’t have enough space in the phone. For those reasons having a wallet in Telegram it makes sense; it’s a nice messaging platform with great features and with a growing number of users. People use messaging every day and having an embedded wallet there is very useful.\n\nBecause there are so many wallets, the team doesn’t believe it makes sense to create another one.\n\nSales added:\n\nWe believe that using a messaging platform such as Telegram allows us to reach to a market niche that was not served before. In the same way you can do a wine degustation before buying a bottle, with Octopocket you can degustate bitcoin before becoming a regular user.\n\nOctopocket prices bitcoins in dollars and euros, and incorporates them as well.\n\n“If people are worried about Bitcoin volatility, people can move their balance from their bitcoin pocket to their euro or dollar pocket.” Sales spent fifteen years working at Accenture Financial Services and in banks around the world and also.\n\nHe stated:\n\nWe try to apply some best practices, double checking and monitoring. To say that a system is 100% safe is not realistic, but I can tell you that if there is a security breach we will know very soon and only a small part of the assets would be compromised.\n\nOctopocket is focused to replace pocket money, not banks or safe bitcoin wallets. Octopocket limits the total amount of balance that a user can store in their pockets. So if the amount of money that a thief stole from a user is too low, what is the benefit of hacking the user messaging platform communication as it’s better to try somewhere else.\n\nUsers don’t need to copy and paste bitcoin addresses to send money. Octopocket allows users to take a photo and its bot will decode the QR code.\n\nUsers can move their balance from bitcoin to other fiat currency in seconds with a simple message, so they are fully protected and even they can start to do trading with Octopocket with very competitive rates. Octopocket hedges the asset positions so customers funds are always guaranteed.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'In January, Bitcoin Magazine reported that a public alpha technology preview of Zcash, “a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that aims to set a new standard for privacy and anonymity through the use of groundbreaking cryptography,” had been released on Github.\n\nZcash offers total payment confidentiality, while maintaining a decentralized network using a public blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin, Zcash transactions automatically hide the sender, recipient and value of all transactions on the blockchain. Only those with the correct view key can see the contents. Users have complete control and can opt-in to provide others with their view key at their discretion.\n\nNow the Zcash team has announced that the time to release their code and launch the genesis block of the Zcash blockchain is getting close. “When the Zcash genesis block is launched, anyone in the world will be able to mine Zcash and users will be able to send it to anyone in the world with the advantage of full zero-knowledge privacy,” states the announcement. “Our aim in creating the Zcash blockchain is to launch the first open, permissionless financial system with zero-knowledge privacy and best achievable security.”\n\nThe launch target date for the Zcash blockchain is set for October 28, 2016. In the meantime, the team is busy with a technical audit, carried out with the help of external audit firms and hackers, to review its code and correct vulnerabilities.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Zooko Wilcox, Zcash founder and CEO, to find out more.\n\nZooko explained that the audit process is ongoing. “The external security consultants we\'re working with are real pros and we\'re already glad that we are doing this with them,” he said. “We\'re diagnosing and (in some cases) fixing issues as we go. We\'ll publish complete reports about everything that the auditors found and how we responded to each issue. We\'ve already spent tens of thousands of dollars on it and before the process is through, the cost may reach 6 figures. This is one of the many reasons why we needed to have funding to create Zcash.” In a more recent update, Zooko has since confirmed that Zcash has already spent 6 figures on the security audits.\n\n“Frankly, the results so far have left me uneasy about the security of Zcash,” admits Zooko. “The auditors haven\'t yet found any critical bugs that would allow a really harmful attack like remote theft of Zcash, but they have found bugs which could result in lesser damage (like denial-of-service), and many bugs which might be harmless or ‘might’ be vulnerable to exploitation and it\'s hard to tell which. The number of bugs we\'ve found so far makes me think that there are more bugs left in the code that we haven\'t yet found. It\'s possible Zcash will follow the example of Bitcoin, where critical bugs were found and fixed in the software even after there was a live blockchain and real money depending on it. This is one of the reasons why nobody should risk more money on Zcash than they can afford to lose.”\n\nThe first version that Zcash is releasing on October 28, 2016 is just a daemon and command-line tool that only runs on Linux. “That means there is no GUI at all, so you can\'t use it at all if you\'re not a Linux-wielding power user and it doesn\'t run at all on Mac or Windows,” explains Zooko.\n\nZooko hopes that that the makers of wallet software for Bitcoin and Ethereum will add Zcash support to their wallets and that they will do it faster and better than the Zcash team could. “After all, we\'re not GUI experts!” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “Our team has a world-class collection of skills in cryptography, infosec, cryptocurrencies, networking and distributed systems and so on, but GUI design and implementation is something we\'re lacking. I know that some of those wallet makers are already working on this. So, write to your favorite wallet maker today and ask them to add Zcash support!”\n\nSimilarly, the Zcash team doesn’t intend to provide a Zcash exchange for bitcoin and fiat. Some of the existing cryptocurrency exchanges around the world are adding Zcash support, but Zooko isn’t at liberty to disclose which ones yet. “Write to your favorite one and request it,” is Zooko’s advice.\n\nOn Mining Zcash\n\nHow hard Zcash mining will be and whether it could be (at least initially) feasible for PC users without expensive extra hardware, can’t be known at this moment. “Our intent was to make Zcash mining feasible on commodity hardware, like your laptop when you aren\'t using it overnight,” explains Zooko. “See this post for our reasons for choosing this Proof-of-Work algorithm. However, it is not yet clear to what degree we\'ve succeeded at that, or whether custom mining implementations and large-scale mining operations will be more cost-efficient.”\n\n“One of the external security auditors that we\'ve hired — Solar Designer — is tasked with studying our Proof-of-Work algorithm and writing a report about this. We\'ll publish his report in full, just like the others.\n\n""I really hope that people run Zcash miners on their laptops and servers anyway, even if it isn\'t profitable, because it is a public service; it supports the decentralized network that provides a private, censorship-resistant, permissionless blockchain to everyone on the Internet.“Even if this Proof-of-Work algorithm doesn\'t close the gap between your commodity laptop and a customized, large-scale mining operation, we\'ve definitely succeeded at ‘narrowing’ the gap, so it is possible that a lot of volunteers running a miner on their commodity hardware will make it unprofitable to invest in building large-scale Zcash mining operations.“If this approach doesn\'t work out and customized and scaled-up mining operations do come to dominate, that isn\'t the end of the world. Then we\'ll be in the same boat as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which isn\'t so bad.”According to Zooko, as Zcash was designing its mining algorithm, he was starting to think that there might need to be some kind of ""fundamental trade-off"" between decentralization and resistance to 51 percent attacks.“With a wide variety of amateur miners using the idle resources of their commodity hardware (like Bitcoin in the early days), the blockchain is more vulnerable to 51% attack, but it is highly decentralized. With a small number of professional miners with specialized mining operations (like Bitcoin today), it is less decentralized, but it is stronger against 51% attack. (Because of the greater scale and because the miners have a capital investment tied to the value of the coin, which incentivizes them to protect the value of the coin.)“We decided to aim for decentralization instead of aiming for 51%-attack-resistance, but if we miss decentralization and we hit 51%-attack-resistance, that\'s not too bad!”\n\nEnhancing Privacy in Digital Currency\n\nZooko explained that he doesn’t consider privacy as a property of a single transaction, but rather as an emergent property from a sequence of transactions among a group of people. “It\'s sort of an inherently social construct in that way; privacy is something you can only get in groups,” he said. “If you buy some Zcash with bitcoin, everyone will be able to see — on the Bitcoin blockchain — to what Bitcoin address you sent your bitcoin (for example, to the address of an exchange that will allow you to trade bitcoin for Zcash). If you then spend your Zcash on something private (say, paying your employees\'s salaries, or buying psychiatric treatment) using a Zcash private transaction, nobody will be able to see, just by looking at the Zcash blockchain, what you spent it on.”\n\nZooko is persuaded that a Zcash economy could emerge in the long term. “The dream is that people all around the world use Zcash and other cryptocurrencies directly, to cooperate and organize with one another in safety and privacy,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “This will give them freedom from corrupt regimes, banks and unstable national currencies.”Zooko imagines that this is a long-term type of dream that will come true in time. “When it does start happening, it could happen fast, but it might be years or decades before it begins. It might even turn out that the tipping point for this new way of cooperating and organizing won\'t be the cash-like functionality that we currently emphasize, but instead, new features like custom tokens, multisig, Distributed Autonomous Organizations and other sorts of ‘smart contracts’.”\n\n“Eventually I imagine these sorts of technologies will become part of the fabric of our society, like the Internet has become during my lifetime.”\n\nZooko strongly objected to the suggestion of “the inevitable use of Zcash to buy child porn or fund the ISIS.” This is what he said:\n\n“I don\'t even think it is a valid question. It\'s kind of a ‘have you stopped beating your wife?’ question. I don\'t think it is ‘inevitable’ that child pornographers and ISIS will use Zcash. ISIS is currently working on deploying 8th century technology. If they ever start to use blockchain technology like Bitcoin and Zcash, it will be because it has become part of the fabric of our society, like the Internet, so that bad guys (along with everyone else) can hardly not use it.”\n\nContinuing the Unfinished Revolution\n\nZooko added that he remembers when the Internet was new and there was a lot of hand-wringing about how it might be used for crime. “I think that story faded away approximately when the first generation of digital natives started reading news,” he said. “Younger people today don\'t appear to know that there was a time when the Internet was a scary new technology that should be regulated or banned in order to prevent crime.”\n\n“We first wanted to push outward the boundaries of human knowledge by scientific exploration,” concludes Zooko. “Now these scientific discoveries (by us and many, many others) look like they can radically empower people — individuals, small groups, and also giant organizations like corporations and governments.“The Internet is an unfinished revolution. I remember what the world was like before the Internet. You didn\'t talk to people from other countries! National boundaries were communication boundaries. And you couldn\'t talk to or share information with almost all of the people in your own country, either. You were dependent on a small number of personal acquaintances and information gatekeepers.“The Internet changed all that, and it changed the world, and it changed all of our lives for the better. The myriad ways that the Internet has remade and improved our lives is impossible to even measure.“But it is an unfinished revolution, because although it allows you to share information with potentially billions of people, it doesn\'t provide a way for you to organize with them. You can\'t cooperate with them to allocate resources. You can\'t pool your resources with them, you can\'t help them pay their bills or make sure they get food, such as by hiring them, buying something from them, or donating to them. And they can\'t do that for you. You can\'t enter into an enforceable agreement (a contract) with a group of people, unless your group fits into a product from the small number of gatekeepers that control such possibilities.“What is our role in history? I want to be able to look back and say that we played even a small part in reigniting the unfinished revolution. I want to be able to say we were there, pushing for that great transformation that began to wash away the suffocating mass of inefficiency, corruption, and isolation — the transformation that unlocked the potential of billions of humans who had been trapped behind walls — cooperation boundaries! If we can help that happen, and help it happen sooner, before it is too late for so many people, then it will have been worth it, whatever else happens.”', 'Former Reddit Cryptocurrency Engineer, Ryan X. Charles, is currently working on a new, bitcoin-powered social network, but he isn’t focused on creating something that will only be used by the Bitcoin community. In a recent interview on Epicenter Bitcoin, Charles noted that creating an app used by a mainstream audience would have much more value than simply creating /r/Bitcoin with micropayments.\n\nCharles’s new platform is called Yours and the main goal is to create a way for content creators to get paid for their digital content directly from their audiences. Although he used to work at Reddit, Charles has noted that Yours is not simply a decentralized version of that social media platform.\n\nFinding a First Non-Bitcoin Community for Yours\n\nDuring the interview, Charles made it clear that Yours is currently searching for the first key community or demographic that the platform should try to attract. “I’m sort of vague about this now, but who are our core users?” he questioned. “What is community number one here?”\n\nThe reason Charles is somewhat vague on this point is because Yours has not yet identified the community that they should target first. Although many people within the Bitcoin community have heard of Yours, this is very much an unknown project among the general public and even among the general tech community.\n\nSome think it would make sense to first focus on the Bitcoin community as a core batch of users, but Charles was quick to dismiss this idea. “If we made Reddit but with Bitcoin, I bet Bitcoin users would use it; however, I don’t think it’s in anybody’s interest that we do this first.” said Charles. “Bitcoin users would probably most benefit from it if we create something mainstream.”\n\n“Everybody in the Bitcoin space wins if we start servicing people outside the Bitcoin community,” Charles added.\n\nCharles’s argument is essentially that they’ll learn much more about what they’re building if they go after a community that is unrelated to Bitcoin. This way, Yours will be better able to understand whether they’re solving a real world problem or just creating another Bitcoin community forum. By going this route, Yours will also be able to ensure that their platform is not so complex that it can only be used by bitcoiners.\n\n“I think it’s really important that we identify one community to be our core audience [who] are not already Bitcoin users,” concluded Charles.\n\nThe Manga Example\n\nManga was the one area of interest that Charles brought up as an example of a community that may be interested in using Yours. “I’m not a big manga fan, but there are a lot of reasons why we think that audience might be good for us,” he said. “They’re really sort of young, sophisticated people that create manga, which are Japanese comics, and there are huge communities of these people . . . They’re creating content. They’re not really able to monetize this in any way, but if they had a way to monetize it, they would love to do this full time.”\n\nCharles went on to explain that Yours could target the manga community by telling them they can earn real money by creating and discovering new, quality manga. He added that Yours could make sure that their product gave the manga community all of the tools they need to easily post and earn money from their art.\n\n“I don’t want to say that manga would necessarily be the first user, but something like that,” added Charles. “It’s a niche community. It’s outside of Bitcoin. Not everyone likes manga, but the people that do like it really like it.”\n\nOnboarding New Bitcoin Users via Yours\n\nOne last point on the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and Yours that was discussed on this episode of Epicenter Bitcoin was the issues involved with onboarding new users to this decentralized payment system. “It’s still kind of difficult to get [bitcoin],” said Charles. “Wallets have improved a lot over the years, but they’re still kind of technically sophisticated.”\n\nIn the past, traditional online payment options have also had to deal with this onboarding issue. In the case of PayPal, they handled it by literally paying new users to join their platform. “That is not out of the question for us,” Charles said, regarding PayPal’s strategy. “If we raised a bunch of money, we could do that . . . I don’t think we necessarily have to do that though.”\n\nIt should be noted that those who wish to create or view content do not need to have any bitcoin to use Yours. The use of bitcoin is only required when a user wishes to support someone else’s content via a payment.\n\nCharles also mentioned the Coinbase Buy Widget as another easy way to onboard new Bitcoin users. The widget allows users to instantly purchase up to $5 worth of bitcoin per day with limited Know Your Customer restrictions.\n\n“You just have to make it fluid for the users to get on and off,” said Charles.', 'Nordea, a financial services group in the Nordic and Baltic region, continues its hunt for AI and blockchain breakthroughs. Later this year it is launching its Fintech accelerator in Stockholm and Helsinki. 200 startups applied to join the 3-month program that will be led by Nordea and its partners, including IBM, Tata Consultancy Services and Nestholma Venture Accelerator.\n\nNordea’s accelerator program goal\n\nThe main goal of Nordea’s accelerator program is to hunt for developments in both Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies. Presently, only 35 startups have made it through at Nordea’s Oslo office. Nordea will continue to pick out the final 20 startups that will work with it in the fall.\n\nJan Sirich, Head of Experimentation & Learning at Nordea, stated:\n\n“The idea is to learn and find new business and partnership opportunities through collaboration and, ultimately, provide better digital services for Nordea’s customers. One of Nordea’s challenges for the startups is to come up with good ideas within emerging technologies like cognitive computing, artificial intelligence in banking and financial usage of blockchain technology. But Nordea is interested in several other areas, which opens good opportunities to attract many different startups to the programme and provides synergy and diversity.”\n\nNordea’s first accelerator results\n\nThe first accelerator Nordea was in winter 2015-2016 with 12 startups. Which resulted in 2 startups, Jenny and Feelingstream, scooping up 600,000 EUR in funding provided by the bank and its partners. After the first accelerator program all 12 startups are still active and thriving.\n\nSirich adds:\n\n“Nordea Accelerator is the biggest of its kind in the Nordic region. We want to offer the startups a unique opportunity to work in close cooperation with external entrepreneurs, international tech specialists, Nordea experts and key decision-makers.”\n\nBanks continue to invest in Blockchain\n\nNordea is not the only bank investing into Blockchain tech, others include JPMorgan-Chase, HSBC and Citi. Nowadays, Bitcoin’s technology is no longer avoidable by banks. With North American and British banks continuing their developments, Nordic banks are also disrupting the industry.\n\nNow, Stockholm has an interested bank, Finland’s capital Helsinki might be the next to embrace Blockchain. Recently, Helsinki had its first blockchain conference, with several high-profile Bitcoin startups in attendance.\n\nWill Helsinki be Scandinavia’s Fintech capital? It does look more and more possible.', 'BITCOIN\n\nThe central bank of Singapore is making a move to put digital currency exchanges under its oversight.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is reportedly proposing a new regulatory framework for payments providers, including digital currency exchanges, in the city state, according to CoinDesk.\n\nUnder the proposal, payment activities will be divided into several categories and companies involved in payment services will be required to obtain a license from the central bank. Digital currency exchanges in the country, like CoinHako, Coinbase and Quoine, will be covered by a provision that oversees start-ups providing “money transmission and conversion services.”\n\n“Regulation will be applied on an activity basis, and entities will only be required to apply for a single license to undertake several payment activities,” MAS said in a statement. “The proposed framework aims to strengthen standards of consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and cyber security related to payment activities, while facilitating innovation and system interoperability.”\n\nThe central bank also proposed the creation of a “National Payments Council,” which would coordinate key initiatives like promoting interoperability and adopting common standards. Members of the council will be drawn from among users and providers of payment solutions.\n\nThe government wants to put Singapore on the map as a smart financial center that leverages fintech to transform financial services, among other things, in the country. MAS managing director Ravi Menon said in a keynote speech early this year that blockchains and distributed ledger systems are potentially the most transformative innovation in fintech—at least until artificial intelligence comes.\n\n“Unregulated fintech companies are now providing many financial services. They will challenge traditional financial institutions, disrupt and even displace some of them but will not replace them,” Menon said at the time.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price and trade volume\n\nThe price of popular digital currency bitcoin dropped again on Tuesday, trading at $575 per bitcoin with a market cap of close to $9.11 billion and trade volume of more than $13 million.\n\nComments', 'A former counterterrorism analyst for the CIA has found that terrorists are utilizing innovative technologies to boost their funding, one of which is through the use of bitcoin.\n\nYaya Fanusie is the director of analysis for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance (CSIF) who previously spent seven years as both an economic and counterterrorism analyst in the CIA.\n\nWriting on The Cipher Brief, he explained how he recently came across a troubling case of innovative terrorist fundraising.\n\nAccording to Fanusie, The Ibn Taymiyya Media Center (ITMC), which is an online jihadist propaganda unit located in the Gaza Strip, has been using social media to run a fundraising campaign. Fanusie states that it is the first terrorist group to publicly use the digital currency.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Europol revealed that no terrorist group was using bitcoin for terrorism financing.\n\nHe said:\n\nAlthough the campaign has not yet raised much digital currency, this effort shows how terrorists are experimenting with new financial technology to expand funding.\n\nLinks to Islamic State\n\nFanusie adds that the ITMC is the media wing of the Mujahideen Shura Council in the Environs of Jerusalem (MSC), which the U.S. State Department considers a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nThey have also provided support to Islamic State (IS).\n\nUsing Bitcoin for Terrorist Fundraising\n\nEven though ITMC’s online campaign began in July 2015, which initially led followers to the encrypted messaging platform Telegram, in June 2016 the option to pay in bitcoin was added.\n\nFor each fighter the campaign sought at least $2,500; however, Fanusie reports that the organization had so far received around 0.929 BTC (roughly $540) from two transactions.\n\nFanusie thinks that the deposits could have come from the campaign’s organizers to test out the bitcoin address.\n\nHe stated:\n\nAlthough it is unclear who placed the deposits in the address, the transactions’ blockchain data suggest that those responsible are most likely proficient bitcoin users and are employing techniques to preserve anonymity.\n\nTracking Movements through Blockchain\n\nWhile bitcoin itself is anonymous, its distributed technology ledger, the blockchain, has the advantage in that the movements on it can be tracked helping law enforcement to find vital connections.\n\nSo even if the ITMC continues to request funding through bitcoin, people may be hesitant due to the blockchain’s tracking abilities.\n\nAccording to Fanusie, the open platform of blockchain means that enthusiasts of bitcoin are more likely to work with law enforcement to tackle criminal behavior and to combat the stigma behind bitcoin.\n\nHe added:\n\nIllicit activity unchecked on the blockchain will only make financial regulators less receptive to growing financial technology (fintech) innovation and the public more skeptical about using digital currencies.\n\nOf course, while U.S. law enforcement engages with the Blockchain Alliance, to prevent illegal activity on the blockchain, efforts by fintech-savvy individuals to help combat criminal activity is low.\n\nFanusie thinks, though, the digital currency advocates who are familiar with digital currency exchanges, forums, and darknet websites should initiate watchdog groups to track criminal bitcoin activities.\n\nHe concluded by saying:\n\nSuch groups could inform blockchain companies, the media, and even law enforcement of digital malfeasance that would otherwise go ignored.\n\nWhether these proactive steps will be taken, though, remains to be seen.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
08/31/2016,"['Thumbnail image via Wikicommons\n\nBitcoin is a cipher—literally and figuratively. The crypto-currency conjures a William Gibson–esque panorama of dark web Tor servers, masked figures cavorting in Eastern European shipping containers, multibillion dollar South American cartel-laundering operations, gaunt college sophomores picking up Silk Road designer drugs at liberal arts–school mailboxes, and so forth. It\'s also an indicator of libertarian Silicon Valley utopianism where everyone pins their identity to the blockchain, eschewing the globalist banking Nanny State and spending the rest of their lives blissfully playing video games on a seasteader colony in international waters.\n\nAll this geopolitical intrigue and philosophical gesticulation omits the fact that, in 2016, Bitcoin is a real currency used by normal people. Following last night\'s episode of Black Market: Dispatches looking at Bitcoin-driven commerce on the dark web, we\'ve interviewed six of those users, most of whom have asked for their identities be kept anonymous. They use bitcoin for buying drugs, selling sex, evading genome-investigation regulations, exploiting supermarket-account hacks, gambling in Las Vegas, and more. Here are some examples of the type of things people use Bitcoin to pay for.\n\nDrugs (and Tesco vouchers)\n\nI\'ve been buying Bitcoin for four years and have used it on a variety of dark-web websites. I buy it legitimately from Bitcoin sellers on authorized sites, run it through a few Bitcoin tumblers, and deposit them on the dark-web site I want to purchase it through. It costs a small percentage of Bitcoin to do this, but I\'d rather be safe than sorry. Law enforcement has gotten sharper in recent years—not like how it was four years ago. The process normally takes a few hours, so I start it at the beginning of the day and try to get it through to the dark web market before postage closes.\n\nWhen I started buying, it was only £3 per bitcoin—I wish I\'d invested more at the time, but I didn\'t. I\'ve used many dark-web sites, from Silk Road, Silk Road 2.0, Sheep Market, Agora, and now Alphabay. Mostly I\'ve been successful—I\'ve been scammed a few times, though, but only for small amounts. I mainly use it to buy drugs because the quality and price is much better than buying from a street dealer. I\'ve bought ecstasy, hash, cocaine, acid, 2cb, mescaline, and opium, but I\'ve also used it to buy cracks for software and £100 worth of Tesco club card vouchers for around £30. -- Anonymous, UK\n\nSex worker advertisements\n\nI manage locations in the sex industry, an industry very reliant on alternative currencies and untraceable forms of payment. For many years, the industry standard for how sex workers paid for advertisements and online services was using prepaid Visa cards that weren\'t directly linked to their identity. In the past few years, because of a pretty highly publicized battle between backpage.com and Visa/Mastercard (read more here), a lot of sex workers and industry managers have turned to Bitcoin and other alternative currencies. I use Bitcoin to fund accounts that enable me to put up advertisements for the women who work each day. My boss uses a Bitcoin brokerage firm in Brooklyn—he\'s wealthy enough to do that, but for many people in the sex industry, that isn\'t possible. Many young, independent sex workers lack the funds, education, and technology to set up Bitcoin for themselves. -- Anonymous, New York\n\nGenome-sequence analysis\n\nI paid $200 to have my genome sequenced by 23andMe, and I was underwhelmed with it. Then I found this website called Promethease—promethease.com—that takes all your genetic data (which, I guess, is a little sketchy) as well as $5 (or the equivalent in Bitcoin); in exchange, you get a zip file with a self-contained web app that presents what associations your single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have with various diseases/traits. The juicy information was more accessible than at 23andMe, and they can get away with telling you things that are more high stakes—even when the science is still incomplete. For example, there are no 23andMe reports for Parkinson\'s disease, but on Promethease, I can type in ""Parkinson\'s"" and see that I may have a slightly increased risk of developing Parkinson\'s. I take it all with a grain of salt, though—it\'d be silly not to. -- Anonymous, New York\n\nGambling\n\nI got into Bitcoin around 2010, when the price per coin was still under a dollar, and there was no real infrastructure or institutional investment associated with it. I tinkered around with it and was able to mine an entire block of 50 Bitcoins [current value: $28,2795] on my shitty little PC, and I held onto it because I thought it was interesting from tech and political perspectives. Also, pre–Silk Road, there wasn\'t anything you could use it for besides weed and alpaca socks.\n\nAs the price went up, I started spending it. The first thing I bought was a pizza, and then I bought parts to build a computer from a site called bitcoinstore.com., which shows that you can run a store and sell PC parts cheaply for Bitcoin. I bought acid twice from Silk Road, too. These days, I mostly use it as a really volatile savings account, and for gambling money: There\'s a ""Bitcoin ATM"" inside the D Casino in downtown Vegas, and anytime I go out there, I pull out a couple hundred bucks and gamble with it. -- Anonymous, California\n\nFake IDs\n\nMy boyfriend got his Fake ID taken in the Hamptons last week, so now he\'s ordering one from a site recommended on Reddit that only accepts Bitcoin payments. -- Anonymous, New York', 'The ban of all bitcoin and virtual currency-related advertising from the online portals of China’s largest search engine, Baidu, has thrown the fate of cryptocurrencies into a dicey state in the world’s largest market for bitcoin trading and mining.\n\nAs China literally controls the bitcoin market, this move is likely to have a multiplier effect on the entire ecosystem.\n\nThough the reported reasons behind a blanket cryptocurrency-related advertising ban could still be said to stem from speculation, there is a claim that Baidu’s action was in line with recent efforts by Chinese authorities to combat widespread financial crime.\n\nAside that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) had revealed plans to launch its own digital currency, it could be recalled that the China Banking Regulatory Commission had warned financial companies not to use the word “bank” loosely in their names. China’s authorities had also pledged to clamp down on online fraud in March.\n\nSo when the tragic death of Wei Zexi, a college student with cancer who sought treatment from a hospital found through an online advertisement, came to light, it was a difficult situation for Baidu. Zexi stated in a post before his death that Baidu had mislead him to seek treatment from a hospital that had advertised a treatment researched in collaboration with Stanford.\n\nAlso read: How China’s Plans to Launch Its Own Currency Might Affect Bitcoin\n\nThis turned out to be untrue but Baidu was heavily criticized by the Chinese public over paid ads. China’s Cyberspace Administration launched an investigation and within just a week had ordered Baidu to “revamp the way it handles advertising results in online searches,” according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHowever, according to OKCoin, the impact of Baidu’s move would be small even though China accounts for at least 30% of the global bitcoin trading. The Chinese exchange says this is because bitcoin trade was not overly dependent on internet advertising but dominated by a relatively small number of traders.\n\nIt added that bitcoin trading was spreading mainly among people working in the industry who already knew about it through word-of-mouth.\n\nRoss O’Brien, a technology analyst and managing director at Intercedent Hong Kong, suggested that the ban could be a part of the plot for the Chinese government to marginalize bitcoins while utilizing its technologies to eventually create its own digital currency as earlier revealed.\n\nSome of the touted advantages of the Chinese government’s proposed digital currency include to reduce the significant costs of issuing and circulating traditional currencies, improve the convenience and transparency of economic transactions, reduce money laundering, tax evasion and other criminal acts. It also plans to use the currency to enhance the Chinese central bank’s control of over the money supply and currency circulation, better support economic and social development and aid in extending financial services to under-served populations.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A new report from financial giant Japan Exchange Group (JPX) contends that distributed ledgers will work ""better"" when applied to capital markets if third parties are involved.\n\nThe finding comes from a 27-page working paper, released yesterday, in which JPX offered insights into its proof-of-concept efforts, as well as the key takeaways from its experiments. For JPX, the report is the latest product of its deepening interest in blockchain, following a partnership with IBM announced in February.\n\nGiven that the bitcoin blockchain was designed to remove third parties from online transactions, the proposition that derivative technologies will be more effective without this feature is likely to emerge as a controversial one.\n\nStill, JPX’s report argues that it\'s necessary for financial institutions to pursue this architecture as a means of guarding against the risk that blockchain data is accessible to other financial institutions who might be using a shared ledger.\n\nThe report reads:\n\n""Considering these concerns or business requirements, it is preferable that all stored data is only accessible by related parties. Since this will lose the feature of ownership certification by public trust, nobody can validate his/her claim of securities ownership. Therefore, full data access privilege needs to be given to a trusted third party who is responsible for the ownership certification.""\n\nJPX revealed that during its proofs-of-concept, central securities depositories played the role of a certification authority, a system that it believes will be as secure as the decentralized version employed by the bitcoin blockchain at scale.\n\nOther entities that could come to facilitate blockchain transactions include regulators and IT vendors, it said.\n\nThe authors go on to assert that having a third party will also mitigate the risk of settlement failures, arguing it could mediate situations between buyers and sellers in which gridlock emerges due to the lack of a promised delivery.\n\nThe statements are the latest that find major financial institutions grappling with the question of how to gain the speed and efficiencies of shared ledgers without offering full transaction history to all participants.\n\nAs noted by leading analysts, this issue, whether real or perceived, has emerged as a pressing question that may be holding back larger adoption of distributed ledger tech.\n\nReplicating bitcoin\n\nYet even as the paper finds JPX offering a more narrow definition of a distributed ledger for enterprise firms, it was effusive in its praise for how the bitcoin blockchain has applied advances in cryptography to finance.\n\nFor example, the authors said that while the bitcoin blockchain featured what they referred to as ""well-defined parameters"", they noted that DLT is not yet a comparable technology in terms of its development stage.\n\nStill, the report went so far as to label distributed ledger technology as ""extremely attractive"" for infrastructure uses, citing its immutability and resistance to system failure, as well as its ability to enable a shared ownership registry.\n\n""On top of these technological features, redesigning the business process by exploring DLT would bring industry-wide efficiencies including financial service innovation or broader cost reduction,"" the report reads.\n\nThe report evaluates six aspects of DLT including its applicability to capital markets, throughput, consensus process, data privacy, availability and cost.\n\nJPX sees clearing and settlement as the layer it considered ""the most important use case"", as it could make existing workflows ""more efficient"", while the firm said it believes other use cases, such as trading or reconciliation, would be more problematic.\n\nCall to action\n\nElsewhere, JPX sought to indicate that it remains committed to investigating and expanding its support for distributed ledger applications despite challenges ahead.\n\nOne of the primary reasons, according to the report, will be the cost savings it believes financial institutions can achieve by changing the existing business processes with DLT. The report asserts that DLT could come to reduce hardware, software and maintenance costs.\n\nThe paper uses this observation as a call to action, with JPX voicing its commitment to participate in more technology trials as an infrastructure operator.\n\nThe authors concluded:\n\n""Unlike bitcoin, which has been operating since 2009, DLT application in capital market infrastructures has rarely been investigated and needs further experiment and enhancement until it matures to be a fundamental technology of capital markets.""\n\nImage credit: Takashi Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This led to increased media coverage, attracting more speculators towards the currency.\n\nWhether the factor behind the quick rise is solely due to darknet markets’ adoption is unknown. However, with the report by RAND Europe that says illegal drug transactions on cryptomarkets have tripled since 2013, with revenues doubling, it couldn’t be far from being a major factor.\n\nThe research institute names vendors who indicated they were operating from the U.S. as having the highest market share of drugs (35.9 percent of total drug revenues) followed closely by the U.K. (16.1 percent), Australia (10.6 percent), Germany ( 8.4 percent) and The Netherlands (7.1 percent) revenue share.\n\nAnother factor that could have contributed to the rise is the growing efforts to decriminalize Bitcoin use which may have shifted attention from the top cryptocurrency. A group of researchers two weeks ago announced the creation of an analysis tool for US law enforcement that can be used to overcome the challenges of criminals using Bitcoin for transactions. Sandia‘s work focused on law enforcement’s most immediate need to reduce the time and resources necessary to trace illicit commerce.\n\nTrading in Monero has also increased with exchanges such Poloniex recording more than 1,300 Bitcoin worth of its trade in 24 hours.\n\nThe growing interest has also drawn the attention of wallets. Bitwala recently added it to the list of accepted Altcoins and Cryptocurrencies for its users to pay bills, send out international bank transfers and use it to top up their debit card.\n\nMonero aims to be a secure, private and untraceable cryptocurrency. It was created in April 2014 as an open source project and is currently maintained by seven core developers, the most prominent fabulously calling himself “Fluffy Pony”.\n\nThe main differences between Monero and Bitcoin are its default use of stealth addresses and ring signatures, obfuscating most transaction data like sender, recipient and payment amount. By implementing these features, the currency offers its users full transaction anonymity.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin forks, Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol whose transactions cannot be traced through the blockchain to reveal its sender or receiver.\n\nBitcoin has its pseudonymity which enables its users not to be obliged to disclose ownership of bitcoins. However, given the transaction history and data that Bitcoin users have disclosed about themselves, it may be possible to recover information about particular bitcoins.\n\nThe market values of Bitcoin and Monero are also different. Despite its spike in price, the low rate of Monero is still affordable for interested users when compared to Bitcoin’s which has gone large scale and pierced into conventional financial system to be eyed by investors.\n\nMonero may not be able to sustain the momentum when compared to bitcoin which has outgrown several phases. A further growth in the adoption of Monero may draw greater regulatory measures that won’t augur well for the future of cryptocurrencies in general.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

At Ernst & Young, where she worked in IT risk and assurance, “a lot of people were being laid off. I couldn’t make sense any more, [of] what I was doing, why I was working”.\n\nShe decided to move back to Jordan just as the Arab Spring uprisings were sweeping the region and soon began working on entrepreneurship initiatives with Aramex founder Fadi Ghandour. It was 2013 when she picked up an issue of Business Insider that covered Bitcoin, and thought: “What is this crazy thing that everyone is talking about? This is something transformative, if it actually works”.\n\nShe spent months reading up on the digital currency in scientific journals and on Reddit and connecting with other enthusiasts on Twitter.\n\nIn Amman, however, there was no obvious way to get hold of Bitcoins at the time. Individuals around the world were selling directly to others, but Ms Doudin couldn’t find anyone in Jordan, or even in the UAE or Lebanon, to buy from. Finally, a friend connected her to a Canadian cryptocurrency fan, she sent him money via PayPal, and he deposited a Bitcoin into her digital wallet.\n\n“This is amazing,” she says she remembers thinking. “This is the future of money. This is the future of banking, financial services. It changes how we pay online, it changes peer to peer payments, how Swift and Visa could behave. Even our concept of what a currency is.”\n\nMs Doudin joined Bitcoin meetup groups in Amman and Dubai, and met Daniel Robenek, a Czech software engineer. Together, they hatched a plan for a platform that would allow Middle Eastern users to safely buy and store Bitcoins online.\n\nBitOasis was launched in Dubai in late 2014 and secured seed funding from Wamda Capital and others in 2015. Its wallet service is now available across the Middle East, North Africa and Asia, and users in the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia can also use the exchange service by wiring money to a BitOasis bank account, to be changed to Bitcoins for a 1 per cent fee.\n\nBut why bother to do this? There are a couple of good reasons, Ms Doudin says. A sizeable user base in Egypt and Morocco uses Bitcoin to pay tiny amounts of money on a frequent basis for things like gaming, virtual private networks and cloud services. These payments can be prohibitively expensive via bank transfer or credit card, or completely impossible, but via Bitcoin they can cost only 10 or 20 US cents in fees to miners.\n\nThe Gulf’s expatriate communities can similarly use Bitcoin to pay bills or top up phone credit for their family back home. Then there are wealthier users in the UAE and Saudi Arabia who want to buy and hold Bitcoin as a way of diversifying their investment portfolio. Bitcoin’s value tends to rise when there are sharp drops in the value of conventional currencies and commodities.\n\n“Bitcoin opens up whole new markets and business models,” Ms Doudin says, comparing its creation to the invention of the worldwide web. “You’d never have had Facebook or WhatsApp if you didn’t have the internet,” she says. “The next Venmos and PayPals are going to be built on Bitcoin.”\n\nA study published by Juniper Research in June 2016 predicted the total value of Bitcoin transactions in 2016 will be three times as big as the total value in 2015.\n\nbusiness@thenational.ae\n\nFollow The National’s Business section on Twitter', 'This September, blockchain hubs across North America will be giving out bitcoin to begin the next school year. Over a dozen regions including New York, San Francisco, Chicago and Boston in the United States and Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa, in Canada, are preparing their events. The giveaway, known as a Bitcoin Airdrop, has become a yearly tradition on university campuses.\n\nThe bits are to be given to students who come out to their local blockchain club’s first meeting. Students will also be introduced to concepts about bitcoin and the blockchain through their peers and a demonstration of a wallet creation and transfer.\n\nHistory of the Airdrop\n\nThe first airdrop was hosted in 2014 by the MIT Bitcoin Club, after the club raised $500,000 worth of bitcoin to give to each incoming freshman. The event was then replicated in 2015 in Montreal by the McGill Cryptocurrency Club during their school’s frosh week, with donations given to the club. The Blockchain Education Network is now expanding the initiative throughout their network of regional hubs.\n\nWhy an Airdrop?\n\nAn airdrop allows people who would otherwise never have heard about bitcoin to try out using their first bits with their friends in a setting where their questions can be answered. Even if a student downloads a wallet and sells the bitcoin, they discover how easily it can be exchanged for fiat currency and would be more open to receiving bitcoin as payment at a future time.\n\nFocus on Education\n\nThe Blockchain Education Network (BEN) believes that the blockchain revolution must happen through education. Most people are still unfamiliar with what digital currencies and the blockchain are, though almost everyone is curious when they first hear about it and want to learn more.\n\nBitcoin and blockchains are technologies with broad socio-economic impacts, which means that different parts of the world will have a different perspectives on it. BEN organizes as a swarm, a decentralized organizational model, to ensure that the education presented at each meeting is relatable to the region.\n\nA Crucial Grassroots Movement for Students\n\nBEN is comprised primarily of students aged 18-25 and the group believes that it is especially important for this demographic to be able to experiment with these technologies. The world is quickly moving into a sharing economy where people can operate remotely and companies have access to a global talent pool. Students will all enter the workforce after graduating and must be familiar with new technology.\n\nEach year, the leadership from a university club graduates and must be replaced by the incoming class of students. Doing an airdrop at the beginning of each school year ensures a strong interest in blockchain technology and many new students joining the blockchain community in every region that participates.\n\nIn addition to the airdrop, BEN has an entire Fall 2016 initiative to bring new students into the blockchain ecosystem including a Blockchain Olympics event in October and a Blockchain Startup Gauntlet in November. BEN also hosts and promotes hackathons for students with a variety of skill sets, and assists students who are interested in attending bitcoin and blockchain conferences.\n\nFuture Implications\n\nThis initiative has become a tradition that can scale as wide as its reach. 500 students receiving bitcoin this September may not change the world; however, each year showing a new group of motivated university students how this technology works may cause a ripple effect of education that reaches farther than our expectations.\n\nIn our view, the “blockchain revolution” isn’t so far fetched. This is a technology which better maps to our worldviews after having grown up with the internet. It has taken 25 years for the internet to move from creation to our pockets. Through this historical lens, we see any current shortcomings of blockchain as an opportunity for our generation to solve.\n\nGet Involved\n\nBEN is always looking for new industry partners and leaders of local bitcoin or blockchain hubs who would like to participate in their global network. If you would like to be involved, the best way is to join the conversation in their Slack channel. Sponsors or regions who want to participate in the airdrop should reach out to the BEN directors directly at contact@blockchainedu.org.\n\nThis guest post was co-written by Michael Gord, creative director, and Dean Masley, executive director of the Blockchain Education Network.', '', 'Counterparty, the peer-to-peer platform built on the Bitcoin Blockchain, enters the non-Bitcoin world by teaming up with the physical card game Force of Will as it prepares to launch its first digital game assets.\n\nThe popular Japanese card game, Force of Will, is launching tokenized game items on Counterparty with the Force of Will Battle Simulator platform is expected to launch mid-September.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to Trevor Altpeter, the director of the Counterparty Foundation, and Koji Higashi, co-founder of IndieSquare, about the work with Force of Will.\n\nHigashi notes:\n\n“This is a great opportunity for us to prove how Blockchain tech and tokens can actually bring utility to regular people and enable whole new possibilities.”\n\nWhat is Force of Will?\n\nForce of Will is one of the most popular card games selling cards in more than 30 countries and ranks 4th in sales volume in North America. According to the Hobby Channel rankings for collectible games, Force of Will trails behind Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic: The Gathering in terms of popularity.\n\nSince its launch in North America in February 2015, Force of Will became an instant hit, passing 1,000 official distributors within the first year of its release in North America alone, then quickly spreading across the world at a fast rate.\n\nTeaming up with two existing Counterparty projects – IndieSquare and Spells of Genesis – Force of Will is scheduled to unveil its platform enabling game developers to put items on the Blockchain with no prior knowledge of Bitcoin.\n\nAs an incredibly successful physical card trading game with a community of over 100,000 players, IndieSquare and Spells of Genesis realized the potential of working with Force of Will, helping to open up the world of Bitcoin to non-Bitcoin users.\n\nAttracting new users to Bitcoin\n\nAs a relatively new game in the Bitcoin industry, Force of Will decided to utilize the Counterparty protocol because the borderless nature of the Blockchain technology inspired them. In a press release, CEO of Force of Will, Eiji Shishido, said that the concept of Force of Will is connecting the world and believes there is a lot of similarity between the two.\n\nShishido explains:\n\n“Challenging new things has its own value in my opinion. Force of Will is not an online game currently, but we wanted to bring in a new value to the game industry. We wanted to offer Force of Will players a whole new experience and the new value proposition is based on the cutting edge technology.”\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph, director of the Counterparty Foundation, Trevor Altpeter, said that many Bitcoin uses so far are controversial in the eyes of non-Bitcoin users.\n\nHe says:\n\n“Digital game items are an underserved market that can create new users for Bitcoin and Counterparty without relying on the users to also be passionate about cryptocurrency. Tokenized game items will create innovation in gaming which may eventually receive mainstream interest and use.”\n\nKoji Higashi said that the community numbers linked to Force of Will is going to have a major impact on Counterparty and the Bitcoin ecosystem. Speaking to CoinTelegraph, he said that the 100,000 Force of Will players are people who don’t understand Bitcoin, Counterparty or Blockchain and just want something that works and benefits them.\n\nThe future of digital game assets\n\nForce of Will and the Counterparty ecosystem will benefit from rising popularity in digital game assets. Altpeter believes that tokenized game items will create innovation in the gaming industry, but it will also allow digital game economies to grow without restraint for the first time.\n\nHe says to CoinTelegraph:', 'The world’s central banks are asking governments for help in stimulating the global economy, something at which they have failed.\n\nAt the three-day annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Wyoming, heads of the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank all met to discuss ways of meeting the current economic challenges.\n\nThe consensus is that they need help. Without additional government intervention, they said, central banks would be unable to rescue the global economy through monetary policy alone.\n\nAccording to Jose Rodriguez, VP of payments for the Mexican cryptocurrency exchange Bitso, the government’s management of the economy is handled in a way that incurs unnecessary risks for people.\n\nRodriguez says:\n\n“Giving the power and decision over money, your income, your savings and therefore your life and future is a great responsibility. Currently, the way the government handles the economy using a very limited number of people is risky when trying to move the value of their notes and coins like interest rates, money emission, debt etc.”\n\nCentral banking not the answer to economic problems\n\nWhile the heads of the world’s top central banks mull over the inadequacy of their capabilities to strengthen economic growth while asking for further assistance from governments, could it be that central banking, as well as increased government action, is itself part of the problem instead of the solution?\n\nSusanne Tarkowski Tempelhof of Bitnation thinks that central banking itself is a problem, and that further government intervention will not be the solution to the global economy’s ills.\n\nShe says:\n\n“Central bankers are part of the problem through attempting to control currencies, adding inflation, and stifling markets. The only way consumer confidence can be restored is through a boosted economy, and that won’t come through any government intervention. To the contrary, economies may reboot despite government interference, through peer-to-peer free market technologies such as cryptocurrencies and encrypted communications.”\n\nBitcoin succeeds where central banks fail\n\nAccording to Rodriguez, while the plea for assistance from central banks represents their inability to properly aid a country’s economic development, Bitcoin can succeed at providing effective financial solutions where they fail.\n\nHe explains to CoinTelegraph:', 'The central bank of Canada has published a new working paper that suggests its researchers believe digital currency exchange rates will become less volatile should adoption increase.\n\nPenned by researchers Wilko Bolt (of the central bank of The Netherlands) and Maarten RC van Oordt (of the Bank of Canada’s Financial Stability Department), the paper offers a possible ""economic framework"" for exchange rate analysis. Published on 18th August, it further represents the latest work from a major central bank, following growing interest from this segment of the financial community in recent months.\n\nThe authors explore factors influencing digital currency exchange rates, which they write include existing demand for payments, the day-to-day moves of market speculators and the belief among some buyers about future mainstream adoption.\n\nUltimately, they conclude major price swings brought on by traders could subside if digital currencies see broader use for payments.\n\nThe authors note:\n\n""Our model predicts that, as a virtual currency becomes more established, the exchange rate will become less sensitive to the impact of shocks to speculators’ beliefs and their inflow into and outflow from the virtual currency market. This prediction undermines the notion that the current high volatility of the exchange rates of virtual currencies will prohibit their widespread usage in the long run.""\n\nLater in the piece, the researchers assert that digital currencies with a ""fixed supply"" are likely to behave more like commodities than currencies, and that current exchange rates are potentially ""a symptom of early development"" – one that could potentially go away depending on how usage evolves.\n\n""The future will show how much volatility will drop,"" they conclude.\n\nWork continues\n\nThe paper represents another step in the Bank of Canada\'s work with the technology, which has seen it comment on issues surrounding digital currencies over the past two years while at the same time exploring blockchain applications.\n\nEarlier this summer, the Bank of Canada drew headlines when it unveiled a pilot project for a central bank-issued digital currency – an initiative that mirrors other work being undertaken at institutions like the Bank of England.\n\nThe bank has explored the impact of the technology in the past, with one senior official speculating in a speech last November that bitcoin could lead to ""a new dynamic in the global monetary order"" in which central banks ""struggle"" to carry out policy initiatives.\n\nThe full paper can be found here.\n\nCanadian dollars via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.
