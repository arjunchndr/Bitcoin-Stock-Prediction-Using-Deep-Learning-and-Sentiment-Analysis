04/01/2016,"['Anthony Di Iorio was one of the original founders of the Ethereum project, which has received ample attention in 2016 as it passed a billion dollar market cap for the first time. Technology firms both inside and outside the Bitcoin industry are exploring the ways in which non-financial applications and Ethereum-based projects could change our world.\n\nDi Iorio, for the most part, has been at the heart of this in Canada. The nation’s most-headlined FinTech project has been the Royal Canadian Mint’s MintChip project, which recently sold to nanoPay. But Di Iorio has commanded a large part of the remaining attention in Canada on Bitcoin and blockchain.\n\nNow he wants to turn Canada into a financial giant and center of innovation around Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nDi Iorio, who purchased his first bitcoins in 2012 on LocalBitcoins, has enjoyed a colorful history in Bitcoin. He founded Bitcoin Alliance of Canada and the first Toronto Bitcoin Meetup. The Bitcoin Alliance is a non-profit organization tasked with increasing Bitcoin awareness and adoption in Canada.\n\nHe started the Toronto Bitcoin community meetup where he met Vitalik Buterin and Peter Todd and got the idea for the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada amid constant press attention on Bitcoin. He saw news anchors giving people the wrong idea about Bitcoin and saw the value in education.\n\nDi Iorio also launched in 2013 the first Bitcoin Chrome wallet extension, KryptoKit, and co-founded Ethereum with Buterin and others in the summer of 2014. They focused on Ethereum for some time, and recent price action and collaborations have cemented the legitimacy of the project.\n\nAt the beginning of 2014, he launched Decentral, an “innovation hub for disruptive and decentralized technologies.” The firm offers blockchain and financial technology consulting services and software development.\n\nDi Iorio recently became chief digital officer of the Toronto Stock Exchange. Decentral has worked with the TMX Group, which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange, the for some time. Further, TMX Group is sponsoring the forthcoming Blockchain World Expo in Toronto hosted by Decentral and Ethereum Canada.\n\n""The blockchain has the potential to be as disruptive as the Internet,"" Di Iorio said in a statement. ""It is a comprehensive technology with impacts to be felt in many financial and non\xadfinancial industries over the coming decades. This is the right time to showcase the many emerging ecosystems, platforms and companies that are at the forefront of this exciting new technology, and Toronto and Canada are well positioned to host this premier event.""\n\nDi Iorio’s passion seems to be working with regulators and financial technology executives to propel Canada to the ranks of New York and London for technological innovation: “That’s my long term vision ? to propel Canada using my connections and the support of our clients,” he said.\n\nHe plans to do this not only with Bitcoin technology, but any technology inspired by the digital currency and payment system.\n\n“We understand public blockchains are not the only solution,” Di Iorio explains. “We try to solve problems. Sometimes, though, problems come down to blockchain tech, and sometimes other technology is better and faster.”\n\nDecentral strives to ensure executives don’t waste time evaluating dead-end products and technologies. “We take a product agnostic approach, and look to see the problem and what technology solutions are out there for them,” he said.\n\nDi Iorio emphasizes that financial technology firms are not necessarily looking into Bitcoin.\n\n“It’s the underlying technology behind Bitcoin, the blockchain,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “They’re interested in providing solutions; they don’t care what technology it is as long as it works. Sometimes the solution is Ethereum or sometimes it’s colored coins.\n\nThe emphasis for Di Iorio and Decentral is on distributed technology: “We are a hub for decentralized technology, we try to have all of our products use decentralized technology to solve problems,” he said. “Our wallets are products where we don’t hold customer funds, or have access to the funds.”\n\nDi Iorio has helped host more than 100 events since 2012 and believes this deep experience in the blockchain space ensures Decentral boasts the connections and resources needed to adapt to the changing needs of not only the blockchain industry, but financial technology overall.\n\n“Fintech is important,” he says. What Di Iorio’s work for the Toronto Stock Exchange will entail remains to be seen, although sponsoring events such as the World Blockchain Expo could be on that list.\n\nDi Iorio says Decentral’s first year in business was about building up a network and community. After that, he built up connections with larger organizations interested in technology.\n\nFor 2016, Di Iorio resolves to “grow Canada as a financial powerhouse in the world by working with regulators and letting them know how fantastic the technology is.”\n\nDi Iorio loves pushing for financial innovation. Although his forte is blockchain and decentralized technologies, he still considers himself a financial technologist. Most of all, he wants everyone to come together.\n\n“The key is to work together, to collaborate and build up community,” he says.', 'Caribbean digital currency exchange Bitt has received $4m in new funding from online retailer Overstock.com.\n\nThe deal, announced today, comes after Bitt\'s February launch of a blockchain-backed digital version of the Barbados dollar. The startup raised $1.5m in seed funding last March from local VC firm Avatar Capital.\n\nBitt CEO Gabriel Abed told CoinDesk that the deal originated at the Satoshi Roundtable, an invite-only industry gathering held in late February.\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s team beyond Barbados.\n\nAbed explained:\n\n""We’ll be taking what we’ve done in Barbados and cookie-cutting across the region, badgering legislators and helping with policy reform as it relates to security, consumer protection, privacy and data, and more importantly, no hindrance of the innovation of blockchain technology, and specifically bitcoin.""\n\nAbed said that the startup will look to use some of the funds to satisfy its regulatory requirements.\n\nDeclining to comment on whether his startup would play a role in Overstock work using blockchain tech, Abed remarked that the two companies share an active, collaborative relationship.\n\n“Let’s just say the two companies are acting as one big family, and we’re being treated as such,” he said.\n\nOverstock itself is continuing development of its blockchain-powered securities exchange, tØ. The online retailer recently disclosed that it intended to conduct a securities offering of its own stock on the platform, expected to feature the sale of 1 million blockchain-based securities. Overstock’s securities platform was unveiled last August.\n\nIn a statement, CEO Patrick Byrne suggested that Overstock’s investment was driven in part by the startup’s work on digital currency-based payments, with an eye to unbanked populations in the region.\n\n""We respect and endorse that vision, and share a common desire to see online consensual exchange flourish globally,"" said Byrne. ""As they say around these parts, ‘One love’.""\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Those ads, chosen by an ad-matching partner, are supposedly faster, safer and load after the publisher\'s content, not before it like regular third-party ads. For ad-free mode, you\'ll pay a monthly fee that will be distributed to publishers based on total traffic to each site. Brave\'s ad network would take a five percent cut of the total amount collected.\n\nHow many publishers will go along with this, since many, like Engadget parent AOL, have their own ad networks?\n\nWhen users go for replacement ads, Brave will take a 15 percent cut, its ad-matching partner would take 15 percent and publishers would get the biggest chunk, 55 percent. The latter pot would be divvied up based on the same traffic measurements as the ad-free method. Users get 15 percent, but there are some caveats. First of all, you need to have a Brave Bitcoin wallet, and the default option will be to donate money to your preferred publisher. If you want to spend the money yourself, you\'ll need to verify your identity with a phone number and email address. Publishers will also need to be verified to a higher standard.\n\nAll of this creates as many questions as it answers. How much will users get paid (and have to pay) to accept or decline ads, for instance? Since the ad-free method amounts to a subscription, how many users will pay to skip ads? (Not many, if torrent software providers like uTorrent are any indication.) Which publishers will go along with this, since many, like Engadget parent AOL, have their own ad networks? These are tricky questions, and if the company doesn\'t have the right answers, its Brave browser model will be dead on arrival.\n\nUpdate: Since this article was published, Brave has updated the source blog post to say that paying for ad-blocking is ""optional."" In a previous version, it said ""for ad-free mode, you pay a monthly fee in Bitcoin (BTC)."" The article now states: ""For sites in ad-free mode, you can optionally pay the site by drawing from your user wallet, funded by your revenue share from ad-replacement mode sites (see below) plus your own funds if you care to add any."" A company spokesperson also confirmed that users do not have to pay to block ads.\n\nThere\'s no word on whether users would opt in or out to pay, and how a free mode would affect publisher revenues. Engadget has reached out for more information, and Brave\'s comments, in part, are below.', 'How would a bitcoin standard fare for a monetary system? An analysis by the Bank of Canada examined that scenario, conjecturing how a bitcoin standard would perform based on the performance of a gold standard that existed from 1880 to 1913. The gold standard was a monetary system in which nations’ currencies were tied to gold.\n\nThe 37-page paper [PDF] is written by Warren E. Weber, research consultant at the Bank of Canada, visiting scholar for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and adjunct professor at the University of South Carolina.\n\nThe paper claims that because there would be no arbitrage costs for global transactions under a bitcoin standard, nations would not be able to follow independent interest rate policies. Central banks would retain limited ability to serve as last-resort lenders.\n\nBenefits Over Fiat Currency\n\nA bitcoin standard would have two key benefits over fiat currency. One is there would be more price level predictability on account of the deterministic rate by which the cryptocurrency is created. A second is that resources devoted to hedging against exchange rate fluctuations would be free to use in more productive ways.\n\nBased on the classic gold standard period from 1880 to 1913, the paper claims currency under a bitcoin standard would have mild deflation and constant exchange rates.\n\nCountries adopted the gold standard to achieve exchange rate stability against those of other countries that also adopted the standard. Stability was achieved through gold arbitrage. But because gold arbitrage incurred costs, exchange rates between different countries’ fiduciary currencies were not fixed but were limited to a range around their par values.\n\nBitcoin Would Mimic Gold\n\nThe bitcoin standard would be similar to the gold standard in that it would not be under the control of a monetary authority or a central bank.\n\nThe changes in the bitcoin supply would be determined by the algorithm governing the number of new bitcoins miners receive for verifying transactions and adding them to the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nChange in the global gold stock was similarly based on gold discoveries and the invention of new ways to extract gold from ores.\n\nAs three distinct exchange media existed under the gold standard, three exchange media would exist under the bitcoin standard. They are: fiduciary currencies issued by central banks, bitcoin, and fiduciary currencies (deposits or bank notes) commercial banks issue.\n\nUnder the cryptocurrency, the scope of monetary policy would be more limited than under a gold standard. The capability of issuing fiduciary currency would provide central banks limited ability to serve as last-resort lenders. However, the costless arbitrage of the cryptocurrency would prevent central banks from implementing interest rate policies to impact nations’ economies.\n\nLessons From Gold\n\nThe experiences of the gold standard yields the following conjectures about the performance of a bitcoin standard:\n\n1) Long-term, deflation would be moderate and would grow over time until a deflation rate equal to the negative of the rate of growth of global output around 2016.\n\n2) Price levels of countries would be highly, though not perfectly, correlated, similar to how they were under the gold standard.\n\n3) The exchange rates among fiduciary currencies of countries would remain fixed at par since the cost of bitcoin arbitrage is essentially zero.\n\n4) Financial crises would still occur since they can happen under any fractional reserve financial system.\n\nAlso read: When the dollar collapses, which is better, money, gold or BTC?\n\nHow Long Would It Last?\n\nThe paper also postulates how long the bitcoin standard would last if it came into existence.\n\nA bitcoin standard could come into existence if the cryptocurrency became the predominant medium of exchange or the backing for the predominant medium of exchange. The paper offers different scenarios of how this might happen, but it notes this is not likely to happen. The author also states he is not advocating a bitcoin standard.\n\nBut even if the bitcoin standard came into existence, it would not last long, the paper argues. The payments industry is changing so fast that technological innovation would provide a medium of exchange with benefits similar to or better than the cryptocurrency. Such an innovation would come from either the government or the private sector.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the short existence of the bitcoin standard is that pressure would exist to return to a fiat money system so a more active monetary policy could be pursued.\n\nThe author does not think it likely a bitcoin standard would emerge since central banks and governments would oppose it. These parties want to protect the seigniorage revenues from creating money. They also want to retain the ability to deploy interest policies to affect domestic economies.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Is bitcoin a safe asset? David Andolfatto, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, acknowledges in his blog, “MacroMania,” that bitcoin can be volatile over a short time span. But when people speak about safe assets, it’s not the same as providing a stable rate of return.\n\nAndolfatto, in considering what makes an asset truly safe, thinks bitcoin does have some important safety properties to consider, either for personal investing or policymaking.\n\nWhat’s A Safe Asset?\n\nA safe asset is one people go to during uncertain economic times. In normal times, a safe asset is one that people hold despite a low return rate, possibly due to its use as a hedge, or liquidity characteristics.\n\nMany view U.S. Treasuries (UST) and U.S. dollars as safe since they are fairly risk-free in their nominal return rate. A USD gives a zero nominal interest rate. A UST also gives a zero nominal interest rate along with full principal payment upon maturity.\n\nAndolfatto points out that there’s more to thinking about a security’s risk. Investors don’t care how many paper dollars they are promised in the future. They care about the purchasing power those dollars will bring. Inflation can cut purchasing power or build it depending on inflation.\n\nConsider U.S. Treasuries\n\nThe UST bill’s market price generally fluctuates from the issue date to maturity. Buy a bill promising $100 a year from now for $99 and you make close to 1% holding it till maturity. But if interest rates rise before then, you’re likely to suffer a loss if you have to sell the bill to raise cash.\n\nThe return on a safe asset can appear stable over long time periods, but in the interim, something could happen. Interest rates can rise and a sudden bond sell-off can occur. There are various events that can cause this to happen. Foreign banks can liquidate their foreign reserves of USTs for economic or political reasons. Inflation expectations can cut the expected real return rate for nominal bonds, causing a sell-off. A productivity gain can boost expected return on private capital, causing substitution of bonds.\n\nIn 1974, investors fled USDs and USTs and flocked to real estate and gold. In 2008, USDs and USTs were highly sought-after as investors fled real estate.\n\nMonetary Policies Affect Safety\n\nThese situations indicate that monetary policy regime changes are important regarding whether a fiat currency is seen as safe. When President Nixon abandoned the gold standard against the recommendation of the Federal Reserve Chairman in 1971, monetary policy appeared to lose its nominal anchor. When oil prices rose and productivity fell in the early 1970s, investors ditched cash.\n\nAccording to Gary Gorton, a safe asset has a lot to do with information symmetry:\n\n“A ‘safe asset’ is an asset that can be used to transact without fear of adverse selection; that is, there are no concerns that the counterparty privately knows more about the value of the asset.” (Safe Assets, Working Paper, March 2016).\n\nA safe asset has attributes that traders mutually agree on, quickly and at low cost. Such objects often become monetary instruments or exchange media. The purpose of coins was to make objects easily recognizable with little effort.\n\nCash and gold are simple objects. There is no need to spend time examining the reliability of the dividend paid by a barren asset; everyone knows there is no dividend. Such information symmetry is in high demand during financial uncertainty.\n\nConsider Bitcoin’s Attributes\n\nBitcoin has the properties desired in a safe asset. It could be the next big safe asset.\n\nBitcoin is also a simple asset in that it is a pure fiat object. The monetary object (bitcoin) has no legal claim against anything of legal value. It is merely a record-keeping technology that pays no interest. Possession corresponds to ownership unless there are counterparties involved.\n\nThere are aspects of bitcoin that are not simple. There is technology behind it that many people don’t understand. But most people don’t fully understand how their car engine works, yet they do have some understanding of how it works. They also know that the expertise needed to help them with it if necessary is readily available.\n\nBitcoin’s Monetary Policy\n\nBitcoin also has a very simple monetary policy. The policy is to keep the money supply fixed. While the supply can be changed by consent, this is not likely to happen. If it does happen, it will only happen if it serves the bitcoin community in some way.\n\nThere is a block size debate going on today with bitcoin. It is possible that there will be a need to finance the book-keeping cost of bitcoin. Eventually, it may only make sense to hold bitcoin for large value transactions.\n\nBut even if this happens, bitcoin will remain a safe asset. (Smaller investors could invest in bitcoin ETFs, even though this would introduce counterparty risk.)\n\nBitcoin’s Store Of Value\n\nEven if bitcoin is not an ideal monetary instrument, it can still be a safe asset or longer-term store of value. When market penetration completes, bitcoin’s behavior will likely mimic the return behavior of any other safe asset. Such assets usually earn a low expected return.\n\nInvestors expect to earn high returns in the event of a crisis. But if you buy near the top, you expect to realize exceptionally high losses when the crisis passes. It’s a great investment if you can predict when a crisis will begin and end.\n\nThere are many issues relating to safe assets. For one, it is not clear that safe assets are socially desirable. The existence of a safe asset can stimulate coordination failure. Second, policymakers should know the class of safe assets can change over time. Should a policy be based on the existing safe assets? Third, what it the best way to consider “close-to-sale-asset” substitutes that expand in periods of extended economic tranquility?\n\nBarren assets like gold, cash and bitcoin produce no income. It is tempting to build “safe senior tranches” of private interest-bearing debt to vie with such low-return, barren assets. Should a central bank issue its own interest-generating digital cash to discourage this?\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Given the electronic nature of digital currencies, physical bitcoins may seem to be a paradox – yet the market remains a thriving niche for collectors and enthusiasts.\n\nIndeed, the purpose of owning physical bitcoins varies. While some use the coins to create a dialogue about cryptocurrency, others want to be able to hold and collect what they see as an actual piece of the technology\'s history.\n\nBut not all physical bitcoins are created equal, and none may be more prized among collectors than the creations of Kialara, a project that has set itself apart for intricate designs that may look more at home in an art gallery than on a computer desk.\n\nSeveral entities, including the now-defunct Casascius coins, have been involved in the production of physical bitcoins over the years, but Kialara differs from other physical bitcoins in that the more common circular design is encased within a bar, bringing to mind the idea of a collector’s case around a physical coin representation.\n\nAs a sign of its success, Kialara boasts high-profile fans including investor and Bloq co-founder Matthew Roszak, who noted that he sees physical bitcoins, in particular Kialara, as necessary conversation starters.\n\nRoszak told CoinDesk:\n\n""In trying to describe bitcoin to people, having some sort of physical representation really helps. People are very visual, and having such a beautiful piece of art to accompany the discussion about bitcoin adds a lot of value.""\n\nRoszak believes that the best way to educate someone about bitcoin is to give them something to actually experience, and this idea has inspired him to give out Maxfield Mellenbruch’s work as a gift.\n\nHe has even presented the Kialara to a number of people within the tech world, including Virgin mogul and blockchain industry supporter Richard Branson.\n\nSince the original Kialara, Mellenbruch has created several different variations to that first design, from the 2015 Kialara Labyrinth, which contains a maze of ball bearings, to the most recent series, the Kialara Signature Series.\n\nThe Signature Series features the bitcoin-inspired artwork of Ricky Allman and Julia Tourianski, seamlessly combining two-dimensional mediums with the sophisticated beauty of the physical Kialara. Each Kialara goes for $179.\n\nMellenbruch recently auctioned off Allman’s original painting, ‘Excavatorelevator 1’. The auction ended on 28th March, with the winning bid was $1,255.\n\nTourianski’s ‘Current’ will follow on 1st April. The winner of the auction will also receive the Kialara version in wallet form — Serial 01/500.\n\nCreating a conversation\n\nMellenbruch\'s first 100 Kialaras quickly sold out, and word spread quickly as bitcoin enthusiasts were eager to own a piece of what many considered to be cryptocurrency history.\n\n""I haven’t had to market them at all,"" Mellenbruch said. For now, he is as busy as he wants to be.\n\nBut in addition to being a coveted collector\'s item within the bitcoin space, the Kialara also raises questions about both the necessity of trust and the value of artwork.\n\nNotably, Kialaras are sold unfunded, and it is the buyer’s decision whether or not to add bitcoins to the bar.\n\nFunding a Kialara is similar to funding a paper wallet, with owners using the public key to transfer funds onto the bar. At this time, the only way to open a Kialara and use the balance is to completely destroy the work of art, thus discouraging anyone from actually doing so.\n\nAs it turns out, many collectors are choosing to leave their Kialaras unfunded, purchasing them strictly for the beauty of their engineering and design.\n\nOne Redditor purchased the Kialara with the initial idea of using it as a secure way to store his bitcoins. Yet, upon seeing the bar in person, he chose instead to leave it unfunded.\n\n""The funny thing is that his crafting of these pieces is so fantastic that their splendor has overshadowed their utility. I dare say most people collecting them are, like me, doing so for their beauty and artistry and not in order to use them to store any bitcoin at all,"" he said.\n\nHe considers himself to be a collector, owning eight designs in total, and sees himself buying ""at least one of every series"" in the future.\n\nAnother Redditor recounted a similar experience:\n\n""My original intent at purchase was to actually load it and keep it in my safe deposit box. That quickly changed when it arrived in the mail. These bars are pieces of art, and they deserve to be displayed as such.""\n\n“You can tell the piece requires a lot of planning and engineering,” a third customer said.\n\nQuestion of worth\n\nFor Mellenbruch, the future of the funded Kialaras is of greater interest to him due to the questions that the work raises concerning the valuation of art.\n\n""When there’s an auction of something like a Monet painting, a lot of people don’t really understand how value is assigned to that art piece. With the funded Kialaras, I am seeing how art can appreciate beyond its aesthetic value or beyond its collectible value,"" he said.\n\nWhen a user funds a Kialara, part of the value is built directly into the artwork, and no one is able to argue that particular aspect of the overall value composition. Whether the aesthetic value increases over time, the value of the piece would grow simply due to any rise in the bitcoin rate.\n\nTrust is an essential component to the design of the Kialara, and in fact, it is a necessary one for the product to serve its purpose as a bitcoin storage device. For most of his designs, Mellenbruch personally created the private and public keys associated with the bar, requiring his customers to place trust in both the security of his creation process and his integrity.\n\nWhile some customers have asked about the possibility of adding two-factor authentication to the bars, Mellenbruch has declined their requests, due to concerns about the secondary market for the collectibles.\n\nMellenbruch explained:\n\n""If someone wants to buy a funded Kialara on the secondary market, they can comfortably know that the only person to have handled the keys is me – not the seller.""\n\nIf others were able to handle the private keys, a customer interested in purchasing a Kialara on the secondary market would have to trust that those with knowledge of those keys won\'t try to steal the bitcoins inside.\n\nYet not everyone desires two-factor authentication when it comes to the Kialara bars. According to the feedback that he has received, most of Mellenbruch’s customers actually see the trust in him as one of the main features of the overall design.\n\n“It goes against the decentralized nature of bitcoin, but it’s a concept that I wanted to float out there,” he said.\n\nRole of trust\n\nThe trust element is a dynamic component of the piece that changes with each fluctuation in the value of bitcoin. If someone chooses to fund their Kialara, their trust in Mellenbruch must become greater as the price of bitcoin rises.\n\nShould someone choose to sell their funded Kialara on the secondary market, they are also transferring their trust in Mellenbruch to the new owner.\n\nMellenbruch wants the brand to evolve, and with this evolution, he envisions changes to the element of trust that some customers place in him.\n\n""I admittedly don’t love all of the responsibility that comes with the creation and disposal of the keys, from the safety deposit box to the need for offline computers,"" he said.\n\nHowever, Mellenbruch maintains that trust was necessary to realize his concept in his earlier pieces, adding:\n\n""I think of the public and private keys as being a medium in the Kialara, along with steel, aluminum, and glass.""\n\nIn store for the future\n\nAs interest in the Kialara continues, Mellenbruch is using a portion of his proceeds to commission Haven beehives. Haven is a network of functional beehive sculptures designed solely for the wellbeing and benefit of the bees, not for the harvesting of their products.\n\nSo far, two of the 16-foot sculptures he’s commissioned have been completed, and they are scheduled to be installed this summer.\n\nGoing forward, Mellenbruch says he is interested in more collaborations, as well as getting some help with assembly.\n\nHe commented:\n\n""Some customers were requesting IKEA-style designs that they can assemble themselves. That’s like a dream to me now.""\n\nMellenbruch plans to launch an official Kialara website in the coming weeks.\n\nImages courtesy of Kialara\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While some cited technical indicators in predicting that bitcoin may become more volatile, one expert asserted the current situation is merely the ""calm before the storm"".\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, shed some light on how geopolitical developments could potentially increase demand for alternative means of savings, which he suggested could mean digital currencies.\n\n""I think the negative interest rate theme is becoming more and more relevant to people around the world,"" he stated, adding:\n\n""Greek banks are now charging to change large into small denomination bills. This is only going to accelerate the trend of people to search out alternative means of savings.""\n\nTempering this opinion, however, is that macro-economic volatilities seem to have less impact on the bitcoin trading ecosystem of late.\n\nFor example, the ongoing drama over whether the UK will leave the European Union, dubbed the \'Brexit\', does not seem to have captured the interest of traders, at least not at the levels of last year’s ‘Grexit’, which helped to push the digital currency\'s value to yearly highs.\n\nModest fluctuations\n\nLarger developments aside, bitcoin\'s price fluctuated largely within a modest range between $410 and $425 during the week ending 12:00 UTC on 1st April, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nIt reached a high of $426.85 at 18:00 UTC on 27th March and a low of $410.50 at 13:00 UTC on 30th March.\n\nWeek-over-week, bitcoin’s price was largely unchanged, starting at $412.89 at 12:00 UTC on 25th March and finishing at $415.51 at 12:00 UTC on 1st April.\n\nMarket participants traded more than 32m BTC during the period, and more than 97% of this volume took place between OKCoin and Huobi, Bitcoinity data shows. Market participants traded 17m BTC, or 51.38% of total weekly volume, through the former exchange, while another 15.2m BTC, or 45.93%, was transacted through the latter.\n\nThese patterns of robust trading volume and modest price fluctuations followed the trend set during the prior two weeks.\n\nIn the seven days through 25th March, the digital currency fluctuated between $405 and $420, but experienced only a modest week-over-week change, additional BPI figures reveal. In addition, market participants traded 32.6m BTC.\n\nThis modest price movement contrasted with the gain experienced by ether, which rose from 0.026BTC at 12:00 UTC on 25th March to 0.028BTC on 1st April, according to Etherscan.io.\n\nAs a result, ether enjoyed a week-over-week increase of close to 8%, a sign interest in Ethereum and confidence remains high in the platform following the launch of its production version.\n\nPossible breakout\n\nBitcoin has lingered mostly between $410 and $425 since early March, but one expert told CoinDesk that this trend is long overdue for a change.\n\n""The price has spent way too long in this range, and its going to make a big move soon,"" argued George Samman, a blockchain advisor and consultant. ""Looking at the technicals a major volatility squeeze is coming. So far the price has held above key support which is basically right here between $400-$415.""\n\n""If it breaks through support its going to break hard,” he added. “I think very soon we will know in which direction it wants to go.""\n\nShould bitcoin experience the sharp price movement Samman suspects may take place, this development could help spur greater interest in speculative trading, a form of activity one market expert believes has fallen to the wayside as of late.\n\nThis lack of interest is evidenced by bitcoin’s ""narrow trading range and low levels of liquidity,"" Joe Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk. However, he emphasized that this may all be temporary, and that market conditions could rapidly change.\n\nHe emphasized the silver lining of the modest volatility bitcoin has been experiencing, adding:\n\n""A stable price shows continual belief that the outcome of the block size debate and network congestion will not affect bitcoin’s longer term value.""\n\nCharles L.

Any connection to fact is purely coincidental.\n\n……………………………………….\n\nIn an unprecedented federal government-sponsored collaboration, President Barack Obama and White House leaders, including the CFPB, have come together to open up a national dialogue about one topic that’s been creating a lot of buzz in the media: getting rid of cash in favor of a trusted digital currency known as bitcoin.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by former Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, is expected to get the President’s signature at the White House Bitcoin Summit next week where he’ll finalize the measure with some newfound bitcoin supporters by his side.\n\nThis includes major executives across the payments and commerce ecosystem, including: MPD CEO Karen Webster, the CEOs of the nation’s top banks and the CEO of Amazon, who has enabled bitcoin acceptance on its eponymous website. A celebrity guest appearance will reportedly be made by the infamous Iron Mike — Mike Tyson — who is said to be helping install the first bitcoin ATM on Capitol Hill following the big event.\n\nRecognizing the tension that may arise at such an event, Obama addressed the country in an early morning press briefing today (April 1) leading up to the event.\n\n“Folks, today isn’t about blue states or red states. It’s about the United States of America — a country which was founded on the great principles that have guided us to where we are today. That’s why I’m proud to announce that Congress has officially voted upon a measure that will move the country forward, united under one central currency: bitcoin.”\n\nWhen questioned about the price volatility associated with bitcoin or the criminal activity associated with the digital currency, Obama scoffed at the idea that there was any reason to be concerned about adopting bitcoin as the national currency.\n\n“Remember the days when folks thought the dollar was a dumb idea? Me too,” Obama asserted. “What’s dumb is printing paper money with the faces of dead Presidents and such on it.”\n\n“Let me be clear, here’s the deal: Make no mistake that bitcoin is our future. A future that I promise is greater together. And greater with bitcoin leading the way,” he concluded.\n\nBank CEOs, Amazon’s CEO and Webster were said to have had several secretive meetings over the course of the last several months about aligning their support around this initiative.\n\n“What can I say — bitcoin just grew on me,” Webster said in an exclusive interview with PYMNTS. “At first I thought it was, well, pretty ridiculous. But then once I got my hands on some of those little bitcoins and watched that blockchain fire up and process those transactions, well, my heart literally skipped a beat.”\n\nWebster said the trio spoke about how they could work across industry interests to help promote bitcoin’s potential as a national digital currency including integration into Chase Pay as the default payment option, and to add a “one-click” bitcoin payment checkout button on Amazon’s website and mobile app.\n\n“It’s a no brainer,” the execs said — in unison.', ""Russian software architects and entrepreneurs Alex Paperno, Eugene Porubaev and Vlad Kravchuk plan to take the insurance company out of insurance. Their Teambrella, a Bitcoin-based peer-to-peer insurance platform, allows users to provide each other coverage for whatever they want, however they want, and without requiring any trusted intermediaries.\n\nPaperno:\n\n“Anyone who ever needed a reimbursement knows that insurance companies are actually not interested in paying out at all; it’s not in their benefit to help their customers. We intend to remove that conflict of interest, and make insurance fair and transparent.”\n\n“Team Coverage”\n\nSo, what is Teambrella?\n\nIn essence, Teambrella is a platform that allows people to form teams that offer each other coverage. If one person within that team requires reimbursement, the rest of the team chips in to provide it.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Paperno explained:\n\n“As opposed to a typical insurance, Teambrella team members don't pay a set periodical fee, but instead deposit funds into a special Bitcoin wallet. As long as there are sufficient funds in this wallet, that team member is insured. Or, if there's ‘insufficient’ funds in the wallet for full coverage, the team member is simply partly insured.”\n\nEach Teambrella Bitcoin wallet is linked to a specific team member, but locked using multi-signature. The funds on that wallet can be spent only if both the insured team member, and three out of eight semi-randomly selected teammates, sign for it. As such, neither the insured person nor his team can withdraw bitcoins from the wallet without help from the other. (But typically, a team member should be able to exit a team whenever he wants to; there's no reason for his team to lock him in.)\n\n“If the team then collectively decides that a team member has a right to reimbursement, all team members are to pay their share,” Paperno explained. “Any team member that declines to pay his part, by refusing to sign his end of the transaction, will essentially have his funds locked up, and can lose his own insurance. As such, there is a strong incentive for everyone to contribute to the reimbursement as agreed.”\n\nGetting Insured\n\nLet's take a closer look at how this works:\n\nIf you want to take out car insurance, you could look for a bunch of people on Teambrella who want to take out car insurance as well, agree on certain rules, and form a team. Alternatively ? and this will be more likely once Teambrella has established itself ? you look for an existing car insurance team, and simply opt to join.\n\nTo join a team, you present yourself to that team in whatever way you and the team agree on. Perhaps you upload a picture of your driver’s license, or maybe you provide your previous insurance records or whatever might be helpful.\n\nAll members of that team then get to vote on what your risk coefficient should be. And, based on that risk coefficient, how much you'll need to relatively chip in when someone needs reimbursement. If the odds of you getting into an accident are higher, for instance because you just got your driver’s license, your team might require you to chip in more when someone needs reimbursement. Or, if you are a very experienced driver with a great track record that will probably not need reimbursements often, the team might be willing to give you a “discount.”\n\nAfter this voting round, the median of all votes is taken, and that median is the offer the team makes you. You can now decide to either take the offer or leave it, or perhaps provide the team with more information and ask for a re-vote.\n\nOnce accepted into a team, you get to vote on the risk coefficient of new team members as well. Additionally, you might get to vote on new risk coefficients for existing team members that required reimbursement, potential deductibles and more. In essence, almost any rule within a team can be voted on by that team.\n\nPay-Out\n\nSuppose you then get into a car accident, and you have $10,000 worth of damage.\n\nYou would submit a claim to the team for $10,000, including evidence. What kind of evidence, of course, depends on you and the team. Perhaps the team requires a police report, a photo or something else.\n\nOnce again, each team member gets to vote. This time, team members vote on whether you should be awarded any money, and, if so, how much; this could be anywhere between zero and $10,000. After this voting round, the median of all votes is taken again, and this determines how much all team members must actually pay you. If all goes well, you receive payments from all these team members on your own Bitcoin address. Paperno, who’s an expert in game theory, outlined how this voting procedure should incentivize everyone to act honestly.\n\n“Voting is a key part of the Teambrella process. Not only because it determines how much the team pays to a team member that requires reimbursement, but also because voting becomes part of each team member's own reputation. If one team member always votes much lower than all other team members, it potentially lowers the reimbursements made to all team members.\n\nAs such, the team might be less willing to pay the low-voting team member a decent reimbursement when he needs one himself. Or, if a team member consistently votes much higher, potentially costing everyone money each time a claim is made, the team could be inclined to reimburse him less as well. So it benefits each team member's reputation if he takes the voting process seriously, which will, in turn, benefit his potential reimbursements when he needs it.”\n\nOf course, as with any other insurance, there is always a risk of fraud. Team members can submit unjust claims in order to receive reimbursements where they don’t deserve any. But Paperno expects this problem to be comparable to typical insurance companies, where the cost of this type of fraud is indirectly paid by all customers as well.\n\nPaperno:\n\n“In Teambrella, teammates are not limited to a standard set of verification procedures, and may require any amount of additional proofs. Furthermore, fraud against peers is usually much less tolerated than fraud against ‘the system.’”\n\nExpert Proxys\n\nAnd there's an important added dimension to the Teambrella platform.\n\nFirst, when a claim is made, all voting team members receive a bit of money per reimbursement as well. By default, this is 5 percent of the total reimbursement, distributed among all voters. (But the percentage is adjustable per team.)\n\nPlus, team members can proxy their vote to other team members. And since voting weighs into a team member’s reputation, it makes sense for team members to proxy their votes to an expert who knows what he’s doing. That expert will then receive the voting commission, while the team member won’t need to dig through claims from team members to find out whether they are legitimate.\n\nThis dynamic, Paperno believes, could make Teambrella a viable alternative to existing insurance companies, as it should ensure no one overpays for their insurance. Paperno:\n\n“If enough team members proxy their vote to an expert within their team, that expert earns more money, and should therefore also be able to invest more time and knowledge in researching the claims, ensuring the votes he issues are fair. This could, in turn, improve his reputation even further, earning him more proxy votes, and therefore more money and time to invest. If teams are big enough, these experts might even make a full-time job out of their expertise. They'd effectively be insurance agents operating in a reputation-based free market environment within Teambrella.”\n\nAnd, making the picture complete:\n\n“These experts could also serve as the gatekeepers of each team. Rather than each team member evaluating a potential newcomer themselves, experts can take this job on as well. While the experts will not get paid for this, they might want to do it regardless, as good judgments will benefit their reputation. And it will also be a good point of contact for them to get to know new team members, which could earn them proxy votes as well,” Paperno explained.\n\nSetup and Risks\n\nTeambrella is set up as a hybrid model with open source clients, that connect to a central server (which will not be open source from the beginning). Teambrella may eventually charge a small fee for use of their platform, but never touches bitcoins used by team members, and there are no private keys stored on their server. So even if that server is compromised, or the project is pressured by authorities, all team members within Teambrella can still get their funds back using only their open source clients (though they'll disband the team by doing so).\n\nThat doesn’t mean using Teambrella instead of a typical insurance company is without risks - if it’s even allowed (which will vary per insurance and per jurisdiction).\n\nFor one, there's always a theoretical chance that teams consist of dishonest people. The team could refuse to pay out any funds to a particular team member, or perhaps even “hijack” that team member’s wallet by refusing to sign a transaction unless part is paid to the hijackers. In that case, there is no legal recourse, and Teambrella won’t be able to resolve the issue either. Paperno expects these types of problems to be rare, however.\n\n“We will warn users not to join teams with no friends or friends of friends in them as long-term members. And, of course, it’s also possible to set up teams for people that already have some sort of trust relationship, like colleagues. We expect almost zero hard fraud in these cases,” he said.\n\nAdditonally, Teambrella will typically offer weak privacy. At least in the first version, Teambrella users will need to create an account through Facebook, which is in itself not very privacy friendly. Moreover, any claim a team member makes will be visible to the entire team. This might in some cases be undesirable; think of health insurance.\n\nAnd of course, the fact that Teambrella is Bitcoin-based is a risk in itself. As a project, Bitcoin is still experimental, and as a currency, Bitcoin is volatile. Using Bitcoin for insurance exposes users to these risks – which is perhaps undesirable for very important types of insurances. Though, as Paperno pointed out: “In big teams, users don't have to keep large sums in their wallets; they can keep ‘pay as you go’ amounts, and add funds to the wallets once a week or so.”\n\nAdding: “And while Bitcoin is indeed volatile, it’s not as volatile as the ruble.”\n\nLike many Bitcoin projects, Teambrella is experimental, and this article should not be considered an endorsement. For a more detailed explanation of Teambrella, as well as some (technical) risks not covered in this article, see the project’s white paper.""]"
04/02/2016,"['Mainstream media outlets are beginning to advance the idea that Ethereum and Bitcoin are traditional competitors. This notion does not make much sense. Ethereum and Bitcoin are two different expressions of a similar notion, with important differences that ultimately make them fundamentally different.\n\nWhile it is true both have great uses for online gambling, especially where it’s illegal, calling them competitors might be akin to calling fiat currencies competitors. While in a way they are, they are much more symbiotic in today’s political economy than competitors generally are considered to be.\n\nEthereum champions a different set of innovations than Bitcoin. For instance, in Ethereum’s “Virtual Computer” notion, distributed participants create entire business models on a blockchain through programmable contracts. This is much different than the payment system and digital token protocol of Bitcoin, which is undoubtedly best used today as a transfer system, although this has come under contention recently per the Block Size Debate.\n\nIn the online creation communities themselves, people scantily dismiss the other as worthless. There are qualms held by Bitcoiners of Ethereum, and of Ethereum users against Bitcoin – in some cases – and, for the most part, they view each other as potentially symbiotic technologies. Any sober thinker would consider each a radical experiment with radical risks. Ultimately, that’s all they are, nothing more. Hardly competitors.\n\nThe notion put forth by the mainstream press that Bitcoin and Ethereum are somehow competitors is akin to the notion early in Bitcoin’s existence put forth by mainstream media that Bitcoin was anonymous. It’s false, and misleading. It fails to understand the entire notion of open collaboration projects, especially a underground online creation community such as is the crypto-currency space. This isn’t a traditional industry. These aren’t traditional economic actors.\n\nNathaniel Popper’s piece in New York Times, entitled “Ethereum, a Virtual Currency, Enables Transactions That Rival Bitcoin’s,” does not sound as divisive as the title. In the article, Popper backs off that notion. He highlights instead the novel nature of Ethereum, while also cautioning how untested the technology is.\n\nBut Ethereum has also won fans with its promise to do much more than Bitcoin. In addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts.\n\nMany Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system.\n\nShortly after Popper’s article, Nasdaq released an article entitled, “Bitcoin’s Rival: Ethereum’s Rapid Rise.”\n\nMartin Tillier essentially just describes the system in his piece in his own words, and the headline serves as merely clickbait and misrepresentative of the article. Hats off to Tillier for addressing the technology.\n\nWhile Bitcoin focuses transactions and value transfer, Ethereum wants to create economic arrangements dictated by a distributed program. Code that can’t be DDoS’d. It’s got a little bit of Bitcoin in it, but mostly it’s got a whole lot of Ether.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Martin Hagelstrom is a bitcoin enthusiast and project executive and consultant working on IT projects at IBM.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Hagelstrom analyzes CoinDesk articles from 2015 and 2016 to showcase the seismic shift in language used in the bitcoin and blockchain space and discusses how the community should react to this change.\n\nWe all should know by now that 2016 will be blockchain\'s biggest year yet, and for good reason – financial incumbents are finding very clever ways to start investing and testing this technology without the fear of fueling what they perceive as a threat to their business models.\n\nThe key to this transition has been the rebranding of distributed ledgers and digital currencies under the larger banner term ""blockchain"", a word that has become so common, it is suffering from a bit of fatigue.\n\nBut the admittedly vague term, ""blockchain"", also comes without the bad publicity that still surrounds discussions of digital currencies, most notably bitcoin. And let’s be fair to the poor person who has to actually ask the board of directors for money. ""Anonymous"" and ""unregulated"" aren\'t the most popular concepts in highly regulated industries.\n\nHowever, this article is not about identifying the right approach to rebranding the industry; if private blockchains are secure or not; or whether they will really change the financial services business model.\n\nIt\'s about how ""blockchain"" has become the most repeated word on the cryptocurrency world, even more than bitcoin, and about what we can do as a community once we accept this.\n\nA look at the numbers\n\nTo underscore this point, here\'s a word cloud generated by analyzing CoinDesk\'s articles published over the past month.\n\nAs an experiment, I decided to drill down and analyzed all the articles where blockchain was part of the title this March and repeated this process for March 2015.\n\nThen, I found my first setback. No single article published on CoinDesk in March 2015 had blockchain in the title. The hottest FinTech technology of 2016 wasn\'t mentioned in a single headline a year ago.\n\nTo move forward, I analyzed the articles where blockchain was mentioned in the text.\n\nHere are my results:\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNew observations\n\nWe went from ""bitcoin"", ""network"", ""nodes"" and ""miners"" to ""blockchain"", ""technology"", ""smart contracts"" and ""applications"".\n\nThe wording has definitely changed and it is because the reader has also changed. The crypto-world is not just for developers anymore – business people are getting involved, and they\'re changing the industry and its culture.\n\nThese are the people that are more worried about the possible use cases than the technology itself. They don\'t really care how it works, as long it does. They care about what can be achieved with this new technology – efficiencies on business-to-business processes and new business models.\n\nBut, how do we as a community best to respond to this data?\n\nMy takeaway is that we need to attract the product guys to the mainstream. People buy TVs every day, and it is not because someone explains how they works. People buy TVs to watch their favorite shows or sports.\n\nTechnology is a means to achieve a goal, and from the looks of this word analysis, financial incumbents are starting to get curious about what they might do with this new technology.\n\nTaking action\n\nIn short, we need to forget about \'how the technology works\', and focus on \'what the technology does\'.\n\nWe may all love the tech, but if we really want to attract the masses, we should focus on the use cases for those masses.\n\nAsk yourself how would to describe the Internet today?\n\nAre you thinking about TCP and package routing or are you using words like chatting, Facebooking and Skyping?\n\nSure, the bitcoin community needs help from top marketers and creative professionals, but we can move the conversation forward as well by keeping this in mind and understanding our audience.\n\nFollow Martin Hagelstrom on Twitter.\n\nComic book action words via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

LLC, a New York City-based investment firm, has begun covering the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), giving it a “buy” rating and a $62.00 price target (PT). Needham estimates the present per-bitcoin value at $655.\n\nBIT is sponsored by Grayscale Investments, which is owned by Digital Currency Group, which invests in the blockchain and digital currency ecosystem. BIT is a private, open-ended trust that invests only in bitcoin. Hence, the value is based primarily on the bitcoin price.\n\nNeedham, according to a 39-page report explaining its “buy” at $62 PT, believes the price of bitcoin stands to benefit substantially from rising demand for its two main use cases as an alternative payments channel and as a “digital gold.” The growing demand is driven by market trends such as expanding ecommerce, globalization, and by the pervasiveness of enabling technology like mobile phones.\n\nThe report says bitcoin is disrupting trillion-dollar markets in value exchange and payments.\n\nHow BIT Shares Attain Value\n\nBIT shares are benefiting from the increase in the value in bitcoin, their underlying security. Based on projected demand for bitcoin as a payments channel and “digital gold,” Needham estimates a present value of $655 per bitcoin, which equates to a $62 per share price of the BIT.\n\nAggregating the two sources of demand for bitcoin (as a payments channel and as “digital gold”) Needham estimates a 2020 required monetary base of $34 billion. Given a 2020 estimated average bitcoin supply of 18 million, the required price of bitcoin in 2020 to support demand is estimated to be $1,896. Needham applies a discount rate of 25% to arrive at a present value for bitcoin of $655, which equates to a price target of $62 per share of the BIT.\n\nBitcoin A Critical Innovation\n\nBitcoin and its underlying technology are among the most important innovations in payments and money in decades, if not centuries, the report noted. Similar to how the internet created a global, open network for information exchange, bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology are enabling an open global network for value exchange.\n\nAll four of the major stakeholder segments – developers, transaction processors (miners securing the network), merchants, and consumers – are demonstrating impressive growth.\n\nWhat Drives Bitcoin Price\n\nThe demand for bitcoin as a payments channel will outpace the demand for bitcoin as a “digital gold.” The strongest adoption will be as an alternative payments channel for cross-border payments and in emerging markets.\n\nFor institutional and accredited investors, gaining exposure to bitcoin through the BIT is the titled, auditable exposure provided. The BIT addresses the unique challenges of acquiring and securely storing bitcoin properly.\n\nGrayscale addresses these challenges by removing much of the complexity and potentially the risk of storing and acquiring bitcoin while providing a traditional titled and auditable investment wrapper.\n\nThe paper goes into detail describing the advantages bitcoin offers in intermediating friction and lowering the cost of money transactions.\n\nIt also goes into detail on bitcoin’s favorable traits as a currency compared to fiat currency and gold.\n\nNeedham acknowledged the bitcoin network’s current throughput capacity limitations. It noted that solutions are emerging to scale the bitcoin network and improve throughput capacity.\n\nBitcoin Network To Improve\n\nThe company expects to see more products, applications and services built on and around bitcoin that will solve consumer pain points and push adoption.\n\nIf bitcoin services were available through major financial institutions, this could significantly improve access and be a positive catalyst for the price. If investors could gain exposure to bitcoin through an exchange-traded fund listed on a major stock exchange through their regular brokerage account, it could also have a significant positive impact on price.\n\nNeedham estimated that roughly 75% of all bitcoin is currently dormant or held as an investment in bitcoin as a “digital gold.” The currency’s appeal in this segment is mainly due to its known finite supply and its value as a liquid speculative investment.\n\nConsidering a current total bitcoin market capitalization of $6.4 billion, Needham estimated the portion of bitcoin’s total market capitalization associated with its value as a “digital gold” to be about $4.8 billion.\n\nBitcoin Helps Digital Payments\n\nWhile other digitally-native payments networks have improved the digital value exchange experience, such solutions rely ultimately on the legacy financial system’s pre-existing, siloed infrastructure.\n\nThese networks have made it easier to use infrastructure, but they have not created new infrastructure. Bitcoin is a new digital value exchange infrastructure.\n\nBitcoin has been associated with some illicit activities and been portrayed as anti-establishment or anti-government, the report noted. The essential point, however, is that bitcoin enables people to be fully in control of their money and transaction activity and it is used for legitimate purposes extensively.\n\nBitcoin continues to grow and improve due to a vibrant open-source community of developers that see to add new features and functionality to money and value exchange.\n\nBenefits For Investors\n\nBIT is available to accredited investors and requires a $25,000 minimum investment. The trust charges 2% yearly for safekeeping and administration. Investors can redeem shares in the secondary market following a 1-year lock-up period.\n\nThe process for adding new shares to the secondary market is somewhat restricted. As a result, the price of GBTC shares quoted on OTCQX can trade at a premium or discount from the trust’s net asset value. If the process for redeeming and creating shares were less restricted, the levels of discounts and premiums would likely dissipate in response to arbitrage opportunities.\n\nRetail investors have to contend with a hefty premium for GBTC shares traded on OTCQX (currently more than 30% premium) that is hard to predict or rely on. Hence, retail investors comfortable with acquiring and storing bitcoin may be better off acquiring it directly from an exchange.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', 'CoinTelegraph investigates the pros and cons of storing one’s assets in Bitcoin versus storing them via traditional methods such as gold bullion, and speaks to a number of cryptocurrency experts to hear their view.\n\nInherent value\n\nOne of the biggest arguments against the cryptocurrency is that it has no inherent value, and as such cannot be considered a safe investment, as if people stop perceiving it as having value, your assets are lost, as it is not backed by anything in the same way that paper money is backed by state gold reserves.\n\nAs Dominik ?ynis, President & CTO of Stealth Company, put it:\n\n“Gold is a store of value that goes back many thousands of years, while bitcoin is relatively new and still out to prove itself. Actually bitcoin is more like a specific kind of coin, whereas p2p consensus blockchains are more like gold the metal. What I am saying is bitcoin might be lead (the metal).”\n\nHowever, Patrick Dugan, CIO of Crypto Currency Concepts, suggests a different model: “I would argue that bitcoin the asset is like gold, and p2p cryptographic consensus is like physics. Gold\'s proof-of-work is all them supernovas what forged it!”\n\nSafe assets\n\nFirstly, it\'s important for one to decide what they’re looking for in a means of asset storage. Do they want a stable rate of return, very low price volatility and by the same token, price stability, or very high returns that come with an increased chance of loss?\n\nRight now, if you’re looking for the first two, gold bullion or other precious metal storage is probably your best bet, with Bitcoin being the most favourable for the latter function. However, many in the Bitcoin community foresee Bitcoin becoming something of a ‘virtual gold’ as the price stabilises and becomes a solid means of stable asset storage.\n\nDavid Andolfatto of VP Fed Bank of St-Louis sees Bitcoin becoming the next safe asset, saying: “Is Bitcoin a safe asset? You\'re probably thinking no, of course not. The dollar price of bitcoin can be quite volatile. One can easily gain or lose 50% over a very short period of time. So if we\'re talking about an asset that offers a stable rate of return, Bitcoin ain\'t it.”\n\nHowever, he further elaborates:\n\n“Except that this is not what I mean by a safe asset. I\'m not even sure how to precisely define what I mean by safe asset. Loosely speaking, I\'m thinking about an asset that people flock to in bad or uncertain economic times. In normal times, it\'s an asset that is held despite having a relatively low rate of return, perhaps because of its use as a hedge, or because of its liquidity properties… I think that Bitcoin could be the world\'s next great safe asset. At least, it certainly seems to have all the properties that are desired in a safe asset.”\n\nThe properties he is referencing include:\n\nBitcoin constitute no legal claim against anything of intrinsic value, it is simply a record-keeping technology, meaning it is not pegged to any other monetary instrument’s value.\n\nIt pays no interest, so can be stored for extensive periods of time.\n\nPossession corresponds to ownership, so confiscation by regulatory bodies is less of a risk.\n\nThe ledger has proven itself secure, so Bitcoin is not at risk from traditional theft in the same way that gold and other precious metal bullion is.\n\nThe money supply is fixed at 21 million BTC, so it will not devalue over time.\n\nHe concludes by saying that even if Bitcoin is not a particularly ideal monetary instrument, this does not preclude it from serving as a safe asset or longer-term store of value. Once market penetration is complete, its return behavior is likely to mimic the return behavior of any other safe asset. Safe assets generally earn a low expected return (that is, they are priced dearly).\n\nAddressing to the investors, David Andolfatto says:\n\n“Investors can expect to earn unusually high returns in a crisis event. But if you buy at the top, you can expect to realize unusually high losses when the crisis subsides. In short, it\'s a great investment -- assuming you can predict when a crisis will occur and when it will end!”\n\nHigh risk, high return\n\nFor those looking for an investment that is high risk, but high return, many would argue that Bitcoin is their best bet. As Rik Willard, CEO of MintCombine, suggests, if you want high returns on gold, it “needs to stay in the ground...to spur value,” something many miners, especially those looking to turn a quick profit in the business of illegal mining, are not prepared to do.\n\nAlso on the topic of illegal gold mining, another reason for choosing Bitcoin over the traditional gold bullion is that you can be comfortable with the knowledge that your assets are not being stored in a means thats origin was potentially morally reprehensible.\n\nThis comes as a new study has shown that water and food sources for 19 Indigenous Yanomami and Yekuana communities in the Brazilian Amazon contain dangerously high quantities of mercury as a result of illegal mining, which has led to researchers finding that 90% of people in these communities had been severely affected by mercury poisoning.\n\nDigital gold\n\nTone Vays of LibertyLifeTrail.com would argue that Bitcoin truly is ""Digital Gold"" but because it\'s so new there is significantly more price volatility risk which is a trade off vs. a much larger potential future valuation. While gold has been a store of value for thousands of year, gold does not adjust for technological innovation to improve standards of living and that is why the stock market has always outperformed gold in any 30-year time period.\n\nAnother big problem with gold is that it has a huge political risk as authorities can confiscate it from any vault and as Gold Money recently found out, there is too much regulation preventing the creation of a gold-based payment system.\n\nTone Vays explains to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Gold is also no longer useful as a safe haven to transfer value cross-borders due to the invention of metal detectors and scanners. Both bitcoins and gold are difficult to protect when they are in your passion, but given the technological advancement, Bitcoin should start to become the obvious choice over the next 10 years as the better protective asset.”\n\nUncertain future\n\nAlex Matanovic, CEO of Serbian Bitcoin exchange, ecd.rs, also spoke to CoinTelegraph about the pros and cons of Bitcoin and gold bullion. He says that while gold is superior in being a store of value, Bitcoin is the investment choice for someone looking for profits. However, one must consider that Bitcoin may not be the consumer’s choice in the distant future.\n\nAlex Matanovic on why he prefers gold to bitcoin says:\n\n“Although I really love bitcoin, I would give a gold an edge when it comes to the ‘store of value’ function. We are talking about long-term investment and bitcoin is still very young, just over 7 years old, it needs to stand the test of time. That’s what gold has done better than anything else, being a reliable store of value for thousands of years.”\n\nAt the end of the interview Matanovic points out that Bitcoin has been a better investment choice than gold for the most of the last 7 years. It might well keep being so in the years to come, but gold is definitely a safer bet.\n\nMatanovic on the future of bitcoin says:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Recent years have revealed a decline in major sports attendance due to how good the experience of watching at home now is. Bitcoin casinos are taking advantage of this same phenomenon to grow exponentially.\n\nBitcoin is decentralized, mostly anonymous, and is not subject to variance in rules and regulations that traditional currency around the world is. For these reasons, it has become a popular way for people from around the globe to engage in gambling entertainment. It makes sense due to the cultural and religious stigma that is often associated with gambling. Making the trip to a brick and mortar casino or gaming on a traditional currency based online casino can be a hassle.\n\nBitcoin allows for anonymous deposits and withdraws in a near instant fashion, making bitcoin gambling virtually anonymous. Further, bitcoin casino players can engage in their favorite games of chance or skill whenever they choose from the comfort of their own home. Hotels, transportation, and eating out costs are all eliminated.\n\nSports Betting is also Experiencing Massive Growth\n\nSports betting is another form of bitcoin gambling entertainment that has expanded at a frenetic rate, with vast potential to continue to grow. March Madness, the nickname for the tournament that decides the collegiate basketball championship in the United States, is expecting to take in more than 9 billion dollars’ worth of bets this year. Clearly the thirst for action from consumers is there and growing every single year. There are a large number of sports books who currently accept bitcoin deposits and bets.\n\nSports and outcome betting junkies will also be excited to learn about bitcoin betting exchanges. Unlike traditional sports betting, where the house places the odds and the players can choose to either take those odds or not place a bet, bitcoin betting exchanges offer players a chance to play both sides.\n\nThe betting exchanges work by supplying a venue for the action of players, who are able to place odds themselves or accept the odds of another player. Players bet against each other, the bitcoin betting exchange is simply a facilitator of the action. With this new freedom in action, players can either be the layer of odds or the backer of the bet. Both layers and backers can choose the odds they prefer, or create their own and allow other players to accept them if they wish.\n\nWhat makes this unique is bettors of both sides are able to place bets at odds they feel are most advantageous to them. This is not the only reason bitcoin betting exchanges should be on the radar of event occurrence betting enthusiasts, they will also save you a bundle on fees. Since bitcoin betting exchanges are not active participants in the bet, the fees associated with wagering there are dramatically lower than traditional sports books.\n\nInstead of the industry standard 5%-16%, bitcoin betting exchanges offer rates of around 2%. This is a huge equity gain for large and small players alike, giving everyone a better opportunity to be successful. If you have not yet looked into bitcoin betting exchanges, but enjoy the action of outcome based and sports wagering, now is definitely the time to do so.\n\nFantasy sports betting is experiencing a prolonged growth spurt, becoming a multi-billion dollar industry in just a few short years. Just like with poker 5 years ago, state and federal regulators are cracking down with the exposure exponential growth has given fantasy sports betting. Many are frustrated with government involvement, suspecting it has more to do with the desire of traditional gambling outlets to protect their business than with the concern for customer safety.\n\nCalls for bitcoin to be integrated into the largest fantasy sports gambling sites have been ramping up on social media. Enthusiasts should pay close attention to the potential acceptance of bitcoin into their favorite fantasy sports gambling sites, as it is likely coming soon. Until then a large number of very reputable sites offer traditional sports betting based entirely on bitcoin, so no one is left without any options by their local regulations.\n\nBitcoin Poker is Alleviating Frustration in the Online Poker World\n\nOnline Poker is not a new phenomenon, growing from a small community to over 50 million unique players participating in real money games in 2015. Also not new is the difficulty of depositing and withdrawing from online poker sites. Long brutally slow or even outlawed by national and local governments, traditional methods of withdrawing your money onto and off of poker sites have been a tedious process at best.\n\nNow many mainstream online poker sites are accepting bitcoin deposits and withdraws. Players can participate in big time online tournaments with up to a million dollar guarantee. Cash players can find steadily populated games from the micros all the way up to high stakes action.\n\nResearch is Vital to a Satisfactory Bitcoin Gambling Experience\n\nDue to the large scale growth of bitcoin gambling casinos, bitcoin poker, and bitcoin sports books, researching where to play is now a must. Like any major industry, nefarious bitcoin gambling sites are out there looking to take advantage of unsuspecting players. In order to combat this players should be aware of the dangers and do their homework in terms of researching a site prior to depositing money there.\n\nFirst and foremost is ensuring that the site you are considering is using provably fair technology. Provably fair technology is now a bitcoin gambling standard and players should only trust sites that use it. The technology essentially eliminates the ability for either the bitcoin casino or the player to engage in any kind of cheating or exploitation. For a bet to be placed, it requires data from both the house and the player to be engaged. Once the bet is finished, it is publicly recorded with the outcome being something the player can verify immediately. This is a safeguard that every player should ensure the bitcoin gambling site they choose to wager uses.\n\nSecondly, bitcoin forums and bitcoin casino review sites are an invaluable tool for players. Bitcoin gambling forums can give players a first-hand account of their experience, good or bad, with bitcoin gambling sites. This allows for players to make an informed decision based on how other players felt about their play on certain sites. Review sites are excellent sources of information about the specifics of each bitcoin casino, as well as a guide to where to find the best promotions and player deals to take advantage of.', 'Bitcoin ATMs are highly concentrated in minority areas within New York City. Some suggest they are targeting minorities involved in the drugs trade. Others argue that minorities sending remittances are the target instead.\n\nDrug dealers targeted\n\nTwitter user, Dan Anderson (@droplister), created the census data map to highlight the high concentration of BTMs in minority areas. Cynicists would suggest these target minorities involved in the drugs trade, but statistics don’t support their viewpoint. As a matter of fact, white Americans surpasse African-Americans in drug usage by a very wide margin.\n\nBitcoin is semi-popular among drug dealers, and particularly popular among online dealers, because many perceive the cryptocurrency to be anonymous, despite this not actually being the case.\n\nRemittances\n\nHowever, the overwhelming interpretation of the data is that BTMs were placed in minority areas to target Bitcoin transactions particularly for remittances, as minority NYC citizens are much more likely to send remittances than their majority white counterparts. Obviously, increased usage means increased profits for the BTM operator.\n\nBitcoin is particularly appealing for poorer minorities due to the low transaction fees involved, since a good deal of African-Americans and Hispanics in New York are under the poverty line.\n\nTo elaborate, the image shows the highest amount of BTMs positioned around Hispanic communities, who send the most remittances according to data that says 25 billion USD was sent to Mexico alone in 2014 from the US. Additionally, the currency is unregulated, allowing illegal immigrants to use it without fear of deportation.\n\nSome BTMs are positioned around areas populated mostly by those black persons who are not likely to be sending remittances. But poverty in black communities in NYC is such that the low transaction fees associated with Bitcoin look appealing.\n\nOn the whole, 65% of the black population in New York are living in poverty, making it the top ranking city in terms of black poverty.', 'De Telecommunicatiewet verplicht FD Mediagroep om bezoekers van haar websites te informeren over cookies en uw toestemming te vragen voor het gebruik van deze cookies.\n\nFD Mediagroep maakt gebruik van cookies om de website FD.nl goed te laten functioneren en het gebruik van de website te analyseren en te kunnen verbeteren.\n\nMet uw toestemming verzamelen FD Mediagroep en derde partijen via cookies informatie over uw bezoek aan FD.nl en uw persoonlijke interesses, onder meer om het nieuws voor u te personaliseren en advertenties aan te passen aan uw interesses.

Bob McDowall is an Associate of Z/Yen and additionally chairman of the policy and finance committee, States of Alderney, Channel Islands.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Mainelli and McDowall explore challenges facing blockchain-based smart contracts, putting forth recommendations for how they can be best utilized in the short term as they mature.\n\nHow smart is your code?\n\nSo-called ""smart contracts"" are science fiction realized. Executable pieces of code stored on a mutual distributed ledger for future execution bind people and payments to actions and outcomes.\n\nComputer scientist Nick Szabo has promoted the term since the early 1990s and describes bringing the ""highly evolved"" practices of contract law to the design of electronic commerce protocols between strangers on the Internet. Interest in the term “smart contract” has risen recently in line with interest in bitcoin and blockchain.\n\nClaims have been made that virtually all of finance can move to smart contracts when combined with an appropriate payment system, often a cryptocurrency.\n\nHere we draw a distinction between smart contracts and “dumb code”.\n\nComputer code can be extremely stupid. Bits of code are Sorcerer’s Apprentices, doing what we thought was our bidding at the time we wrote the code, oblivious to changes in our intentions.\n\nAuthor Larry Niven explains:\n\n“That’s the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers.”\n\nCode embedded in mutual distributed ledgers is real and useful, and sometimes dangerous. If that code is written to emulate real-world contracts it should perhaps more appropriately be called a “code contract”.\n\nSmart contracts have a number of parts. The transactions must involve more than the mere transfer of a virtual currency from one person to another (i.e. a payment transfer) and involve two or more parties (as every contract must).\n\nMost critically, the implementation of the contract requires no direct human involvement after the smart contract has been made a part of the distributed ledger, which makes these contracts ""smart"", or autonomous. The code automates the ""what if this happens"" element of traditional contracts.\n\nIdeas resurface\n\nComputer code behaves in expected ways without the linguistic ambiguity of human languages.\n\nThe code is replicated on many computers and run by the network when events require it, typically the expiration of some time period. ""Sprite"" is an old term for using more traditional coding languages to achieve similar ends. They are effectively little ""ghosts"" or “geists” that act autonomously.\n\nThree decades ago, sprites were commonly used to integrate graphics into video games. Sprites are still found on navigation buttons or adding visual appeal to web pages. While smart contract coding languages try to ""hobble"" the code to ensure no unintended consequences, sprite coders are trying to use the power of traditional coding languages to release their potential, relying on control by coders who are presumed to be smarter than the code they let loose.\n\nSprites are no more than code placed into a distributed, immutable data structure, and can be run from pieces of Python, Lisp or Go languages embedded in, and recursively writing to, a blockchain.\n\nThey are often used to perform simple security functions such as key and password structures, reading and writing directly to their ledger.\n\nEnter Ethereum\n\nSmart contracts, unlike sprites, tend to use specialist architecture.\n\nA number of programming languages and virtual machine software engines have been developed to ensure that smart contract code runs in a secure way. Ethereum is a particularly popular blockchain platform with programs and protocols to facilitate the automated performance of a contract.\n\nThough perhaps the strongest proponent of smart contract-enabled blockchains, Ethereum moving away from using “smart contract” indiscriminately for pieces of code and towards using the term only when the code is directed at contemporary legal issues.\n\nEthereum plans to use its blockchain to conduct cryptocurrency transactions of some complexity. Augur is a decentralized, open-source prediction market platform built on the Ethereum blockchain for prediction markets. Ethereum hopes to satisfy complex contracts in areas such as betting, mortgages and insurance.\n\nIn theory, platforms can be created which enable financial firms to create programmable versions of traditional securities – ""smart securities"" – stored in a distributed ledger.\n\nThe benefits seem obvious. Faster and cheaper bureaucracy and administration. Fewer errors and disputes. The amount of paperwork to support transactions should diminish. Routine transaction processing jobs will disappear.\n\nMany mid-level jobs with routine judgemental tasks and controls can be automated. Securities issuance, transfer and tracking should be streamlined using unique identifiers and asset segregation through securities clearing and settlement. Asset servicing, allocating dividends and interest payments as well as corporate actions processing, should be automated. Derivatives clearing might move to smart contracts.\n\nContract limitations\n\nWe see two particular problems in the extreme smart contract scenarios, data sources and deposits. First, smart contracts of substance rely on external data sources of many kinds, ranging from Libor to FX rates to interest rates, to meteorological information.\n\nSmart contracts have been proposed, for example, to handle prediction markets on US elections. Have the programmers forgotten ""hanging chads""? Is there some “ticker tape” of US Supreme Court decisions the program can access to decide who won the bet on the US election? No.\n\nSo these types of programs are not self-contained. They rely on outside information and some of this outside information can be unreliable. If any market gets big enough, it is worth ""gaming"" – remember the Libor and FX scandals? Data sources can be unreliable for more prosaic reasons, such as a meteorological station being out of action.\n\nWhat does a smart contract do then? Wait? Infill, i.e. guess? Revert to human intervention? So surely it’s great to move financial structures into code on blockchains? Parties can see clearly what they are committing to, and let the code decide outcomes and run when it determines it needs to.\n\nIn reality, the mathematical and academic disciplines of provable code are in their infancy. Further, these structures are computationally expensive and complex. The financial services industry needs to be able to articulate why a decentralized system of data storage and computation is worth the additional cost and complexity.\n\nMany ways to \'go legal\'\n\nTraditionally, it has been more efficient and cost effective for one organization to act centrally as a “trusted third party” running the storage and computing platform in a formal or informal ""club"" arrangement.\n\nCustomers or members could log in, strike a bargain and rely on the trusted third party to validate the bargain and assets, safeguard the transactions and preserve the transaction records.\n\nSometimes the trusted third party enforces arrangements, sometimes enforcement is left to the legal system. But ""the legal system"" is diverse. As well as litigation, there are many other means of resolving disputes, for example, expert determination where an independent third party makes a final and binding determination in a dispute, often used in contracts that require a valuation or technical assessment of who did what how well.\n\nMediation is a “without prejudice” process that helps both parties reach a resolution yet often takes into account how a court might interpret the situation.\n\nArbitration is dispute resolution by a private third party, effectively a private court, often needed in complex international situations or where the parties favor speedy resolution. This diversity within the “legal system” reflects the many different ways commerce can go wrong and the need for a variety of ways to put things back on track.\n\nProof or guarantee of execution is not possible under some business models or transaction forms. For example, no guarantee of execution is possible where execution is dependent on service levels or variable fee rates.\n\nSuch models beg the question \'How do I know the code will do what it says it can do?\' And \'When the code isn’t doing what I wanted it to do, how do I stop it, and if needed, move the problem into the shrewd hands of experts, mediators, arbitrators, and lawyers?\'\n\nContracts over long periods of time that have material payment considerations may need to hold money in escrow, “on deposit”. This limits ""liquidity"", resulting in lots of money being held on account and unusable.\n\nThis can be solved by creating netting and insurance vehicles but then we’ve gone round in a circle and recreated the central financial third parties we were supposedly disintermediating. There are some interesting ways of addressing these issues, but financial services and technologists are at an early stage of exploring these.\n\nNot so fast\n\nSo what do we predict? At least in the near term “dumb and short-term contracts” will prevail over “smart long-term contracts”, for three reasons. First, if an executable contract has a life of a day or so, then the mutual distributed ledger is not open to long-term sabotage or disruption.\n\nSecond, most realistic smart contracts seem to rely on the existence of persistent external data sources, which means the contracts become complicated quickly, or wind up relying on human intervention, rather defeating their purpose. So contracts that depend only on the ledger and perhaps a timing source have an advantage.\n\nThird, smart contracts that involve payments requiring the posting of collateral are going to be seriously restricted. Locking-up collateral would lead to a serious reduction in leverage and pull liquidity out of markets.\n\nMarkets might become more stable, but the significant reduction in leverage and consequent market decline would be strongly resisted by market participants.\n\nRadical innovation, overturning the accepted order of business models and processes, needs to be tested over time.\n\nThe starting point is simple experimentation focused on application of smart contracts to simple tasks and processes. Simple tasks and processes will limit information dependencies and financial, reputational, and operational risks. Once smart contracts are let loose in a commercial world, it is difficult to rein them in without considerable risk cost and embarrassment to say the least. Even simple tasks should be confined simple near-term transactions.\n\nIn the financial sector that means leaving long-term financial instruments such as swaps and most bonds till much later, when there is stronger empirical proof that such contracts can be reliably written.\n\nIn practical terms, that means a focus on simple tasks, such as security keys or timestamping or archiving, with simple ledger interactions and data dependencies limited to narrow, reliable data sources, perhaps the ledger itself and some universal time clock.\n\nFor the immediate future, a ""get out of smart contract clause"" will invoke human intervention. As well as ""legal jurisdiction"", ""human intervention"" will need to be ""written into"" so-called smart contracts for the foreseeable future.\n\nContracts that require human intervention or intermediation by way of arbitration, mediation, or expert determination, will be unsuitable for smart contracts for some time.\n\nSome examples of application areas that might be suitable now include:\n\n• Trading ownership of digital assets in self-referential or token-based online marketplaces\n\n\n\nOwnership of digital property over the Internet can be established in a peer-to-peer decentralized environment. This environment extends to pre-sale tokens representing ownership of tickets, merchandise, products and subscriptions.\n\nSmart contracts or sprites may find their ""smartest"" application areas here in the near term.\n\n• Trading voting rights\n\nCorporate and social enterprises and even political parties have proposed the creation of blockchain-based systems to build a fairer and more transparent voting environments.\n\nNasdaq will test blockchain technology to ""better manage and streamline the proxy voting process"". Smart contracts or sprites could provide in significantly better corporate governance as institutional agents (pension funds) distribute voting rights to the ultimate beneficiaries (pensioners) to hold corporate management to account.\n\n• Identity management\n\nSmart contracts or sprites can help know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) needs. Ultimate beneficial ownership or health information applications may use mutual distributed ledgers to transmit authenticated or notarised documents, recording their use and structuring key management.\n\nBlockchain underpins smart contracts because the implementation of the contract requires no direct human involvement after the smart contract has been made a part of the blockchain, which makes these contracts ""smart"".\n\nBut, until there has been much more extensive experimentation with smart contracts, for practical commercial purposes, they should be confined to a restricted set of short-term digital transactions.\n\nThis article was originally published by Z/Yen Group and has been republished here with the author\'s permission.\n\nJeweler image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

04/03/2016,"['For Dave Bitcoin, the alias of the software architect that hacks people’s cryptocurrrency passwords, the price surge of Ethereum’s blockchain token ether has generated a significant amount of work; work that wouldn’t have been steered his way without his focus on developing trust.\n\nAnd just to be clear, Dave Bitcoin hacks people’s passwords with their permission. He runs the website Wallet Recovery Services, which recovers people’s lost or forgotten passwords by brute force decryption – that is, using a computer program to try millions of passwords in a short amount of time.\n\nHe provides the service for bitcoin, litecoin and most other alternative cryptocurrency wallets, and in December, he began decrypting Ethereum pre-sale wallets.\n\n""I love a challenge,"" said Dave Bitcoin, who’s pseudonym remains from the days when it was unclear if cryptocurrency was legal.\n\nDave Bitcoin told CoinDesk:\n\n""Initially, back in mid-2013, I just wanted to understand the cryptography used by bitcoin and the formats of encryption in the wallets. I realized that I was able to potentially help people who have forgotten their wallet passwords, and it grew from there.""\n\nDave Bitcoin has worked with more than 1,000 people since he launched the service, most in need of password recovery but a few that wanted deleted wallet files recovered. His success rate is about 30%, but it’s a rate that varies drastically based on how much information a client gives.\n\nSince January, Dave Bitcoin\'s Ethereum business has exploded, coinciding with the 1000% price increase. Today, about 50% of his business is decrypting Ethereum wallets, 40% is bitcoin related and the remaining 10% is recovering altcoin wallets, like litecoin or dogecoin.\n\nDave Bitcoin charges 20% of the amount in the wallet, which is a risk since typically he doesn’t know how much is in the wallet before he decrypts it.\n\n""I try to help everyone, even if the money involved in the wallets doesn’t really make financial sense,"" Dave Bitcoin said.\n\nTrust business\n\nThis emphasis on customer service is necessary because he’s trying to build a trusted offering with a service that’s a bit intimidating.\n\nTo start, consumers must hand over what they think their password could be. Since many consumers use the same or variations of the same password for multiple accounts, this can be worrisome.\n\nBut after Dave unlocks a wallet and takes his cut, he sends an email explaining to clients that they should change or stop using any of the passwords they disclosed to him.\n\nThe software Dave uses is configurable but if the password is particularly unusual, a custom code is needed on a per-client basis to decrypt.\n\nDave Bitcoin’s software runs on high-performance computers, generally Amazon Web Services (AWS) computers. Each computer node pulls a subset of the password candidates from a high-speed online database and processes them, executing the appropriate cryptographic primitive operations to examine the candidate passwords to determine the correct password.\n\nDave uses both Linux and Windows nodes on AWS.\n\n“I can start up one node on AWS or 100 or more, just with the click of a button,” he said. ""But of course, running these computers does come at a financial cost, so I need to balance the cost of the decryption versus the likelihood of success.""\n\nThe software is also capable of using GPU cards for more common wallet types like those offered by Bitcoin Core, speeding up the recovery process.\n\nWith several of his coded algorithms, the software can perform millions of decryption attempts per second.\n\n""It is a fun process, and nothing is more enjoyable than helping someone recover their bitcoins or ether or altcoins,"" Dave said, but the financial reward hasn’t been enough for him to give up his day job as a software architect.\n\nValue of reputation\n\nAfter some research, Wallet Recovery Services seems the only offering for cryptocurrency recovery services. Perhaps due to a lack of other options, Dave Bitcoin has built up trust over the past several years.\n\nStephanie Murphy, the host of the podcast ""Let’s Talk Bitcoin"" and Ludvig Oberg, co-founder of Swedish bitcoin exchange, Safello have used the service. And bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain redirects their clients looking for password recovery to Dave Bitcoin.\n\n""My reputation is very important to me, and I act honestly with my clients at all times,"" he said. ""Trust is a fragile thing, and I am aware that I need to remain squeaky clean so that I do not lose the respect of the crypto-community.""\n\nThis hits at a core hurdle for bitcoin and other cryptocurrency startups interfacing with consumer’s money. There have been numerous bitcoin companies, for instance Mt Gox, that have failed, taking consumer’s money with them, and other businesses that turned out to be scam operations running away with the money invested by customers.\n\nThis has brought the heat from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) onto the industry. The CFPB has been increasing oversight on bitcoin services for several years, issuing an advisory on the risks possed by virtual currency in August 2014.\n\nOne of the risks mentioned is the absence of private key or password recovery options.\n\nBut educational organization Consumer’s Research has actually advocated for bitcoin in this regard, saying bitcoin could boost consumer protections because the protocol makes it possible for people to take security into their own hands instead of relying on third parties.\n\nBut it will be a challenge getting consumers to switch over to more accountable systems when they’re used to insurance and other protections.\n\nAs Dave Bitcoin said and his service proves:\n\n""It is still early days in the cryptocurrency world.""\n\nImage courtesy of Dave Bitcoin\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The April Fools' joke is a take on how mining is perceived by those uninitiated to cryptocurrency\n\nChina is one of the major economies and a regional superpower in Asia. The vast country with the highest population in the world is also the country that tops the charts with the highest hashing power. The Chinese Bitcoin community is actively involved in Bitcoin mining operations and the Chinese mining pools are in control of the majority of overall Bitcoin mining.\n\nAccording to the latest data available on Blockchain.info, the top three Bitcoin mining pools are AntPool, F2Pool, and BTCC Pool. AntPool is a mining pool operated by the company known for AntMiner ASIC miners, BitMain while BTCC Pool is operated by the well-known Chinese Bitcoin exchange BTCC. All the three put together, will make up to about 67 percent of the total share.\n\nBTCC is one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in the world which has been in operation for over 5 years now. The exchange started out as BTCChina in 2011 by Bobby Lee. BTCC currently addresses almost every requirement of the Bitcoin community with its range of product and service offerings. BTCC’s offerings include cryptocurrency exchange services, mining pool, digital currency payment processing services, consumer wallets and blockchain engravings. The company has so far raised multiple rounds of investments from the Lighthouse Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Blockchain Capital and Trilogy Ventures.\n\nNo matter how big the company is and how serious the Bitcoin business is, the company has not lost its sense of humor. On April 1st, the company released a ‘documentary’ on Bitcoin mining in China. In this documentary, the BTCC employees take a person from ‘SNTV’ on a tour of the Bitcoin mining operation. The full documentary is available on YouTube at the following link.\n\n\n\nOnce you get the full picture of how the Bitcoin mining was carried out on that particular date by BTCC, watch the next video about Bitcoin mining in China is really carried out. The following video was first published last year by the publication, Vice.\n\n\n\nBTCC’s take on mining in that prank video is the exact depiction of what goes inside the head of someone who hears about bitcoin and mining for the very first time. It takes time for the uninitiated to get a clear picture of bitcoin and mining. Unfortunately, there is a significant portion of the population who don’t have much idea about these concepts.\n\nIn order to ensure better adoption of bitcoin among the masses, it is imperative to educate everyone about bitcoin and make then understand the whole mechanism. Those who understand the digital currency will be more open towards the usage of bitcoin, driving the demand for digital currency upwards; It will also result in increased transactions followed by a rise in the value of the digital currency.\n\nBTCC has also been in the center of the Bitcoin block-size debate. The debate has not resulted in any solid solutions to address the block size issue. the miners and other Bitcoin community members are currently concerned about the capacity of Bitcoin network to execute transactions as the Bitcoin network grows bigger. As the number of transactions on the network increases, the current state of blockchain may lead to the creation of backlogs which will end up delaying the confirmation of transactions. These backlogs will also lead to an increase in miner fee for transactions.\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether the video by BTCC was a prank or not, but the scalability issues faced by the Bitcoin ecosystem is no joke!"", 'At a press conference in Barbados on Friday, alongside the Minister of Finance, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne announced closing a US$4 Million Series A investment in Barbadian bitcoin exchange Bitt. The funds constitute the first installment of a staggered investment from the retail giant, totalling US$16 million, and places Bitt’s valuation at US$50 million, according to the company.\n\nMainstream media in Barbados has covered the event heavily, providing details of the service and the investment.\n\nOverstock\'s share price rose 2.8% on news of the announcement, in a buoyant US market. The up tick follows a long bear run for the stock, following Byrne\'s initial foray into the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBarbados Finance Minister Christopher Sinckler pledged the government\'s “full support” to the partnership, and Bitt\'s initiative to modernize the financial infrastructure of Barbados and the Caribbean.\n\nNear the end of February, Bitt launched a mobile wallet complete with a digitized version of the Barbadian dollar, using the Bitcoin blockchain to keep track of this digital fiat currency. What\'s more, this digital Barbadian Dollar has the full backing of the Central Bank of Barbados, a first of it\'s kind for Bitcoin.\n\nBitt\'s leadership has stated that they intend to digitize every fiat currency used in the Caribbean, placing them on the blockchain. The goal is to ease bottlenecks in trade between the islands, and bring a modern, digital solution to a part of the world that historically has been hampered by outdated or missing exchange and settlement systems. Less than two months after announcing these plans, the team has already met with many of the central banks in the Caribbean.\n\n“We respect and endorse that vision,” said Overstock CEO Dr. Patrick M. Byrne, ""and share a common desire to see online consensual exchange flourish globally.”\n\n- Dr. Patrick M. Byrne, Overstock CEO\n\n“Bitt’s financial technology revolution will bring to consumers a faster, better, cheaper and more traceable way of banking – and we now have a new, multi-billion dollar backed investor to help make this vision a reality,” said Oliver Gale, Bitt CFO and Co-Founder. “Bitt is bringing modern financial solutions to a region long denied efficient settlement systems.”\n\nOVERSEAS PLAYER INVESTS MILLIONS IN NEW BARBADIAN DIGITAL COMPANY The company behind Barbados\' new digital currency... Posted by CBC News Barbados on Saturday, April 2, 2016\n\nAlong with the launch of their wallet and digital currency, Bitt has separately announced other upcoming services, including merchant and remittance solutions. All of this is built on top of the existing business as a bitcoin exchange, which is already the largest one in the Caribean by volume. The exchange platform offers trading bitcoin for two currencies, Trinidad and Tobago dollars and Barbadian dollars.\n\nThe team plans for the exchange to become a trading hub for all the currencies in the Caribbean, a solution called for by the UN\'s economic commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) at the beginning of February. Such a move would be a historic first, opening the region up to trade in a way that simply hasn\'t been possible before.\n\n- Gabriel Abed, Bitt CEO & Co-founder\n\nThis isn\'t the first investment in Bitt. The organizers of Friday\'s announcement, Avatar Capital, invested US$1.5 million in a seed round last year. The well-funded company outlined their intentions to bring digital currency to the region, and break down trade barriers, at the time. With Overstock\'s investment announcement this week, it appears they may now have the funding they need to make the dream a reality.', 'It is now possible to buy anything with bitcoin. Starting with something as simple as a pizza worth $10 to a brand new high tech electric automobile. Bitcoin has come a long way since it was first introduced in 2008. When it was first introduced, the idea behind it was well appreciated as it solved the double spending problem which was plaguing the computer scientists for a long time.\n\nThe blockchain technology used by bitcoin allows the protocol to keep a record of all the transactions happening over the network and prevent the same digital token from being used twice (double-spend). Since its introduction, the use of Bitcoin technology has grown beyond just digital currency. The Bitcoin technology is now being used for a range of applications in multiple industries. Even as a currency, Bitcoin is now increasingly being accepted by various businesses across the world.\n\nRecently, Mason Borda, a software engineer at BitGo pre-ordered a Tesla Model 3 and paid for it using bitcoin. In his blog titled “I Just Preordered a Tesla Model 3”. Mason Borda explains how he got introduced to Tesla in the first place and the process he followed to pre-order his favorite car from the electric car manufacturer.\n\nMason Borda, however, did not directly send bitcoin to a wallet address or use a bitcoin payment gateway in the Tesla site to pre-order the new Model 3. Instead, he used bitcoin to make payment on the car manufacturer’s site while making use of the conventional fiat payments channels. In order to do that, he had to take the help of a single use bitcoin-powered credit card service, ShakePay.\n\nCreated by Elon Musk, the technology entrepreneur, and inventor, Tesla is a leading electric automobile manufacturer known for offering high-performance cars in the electric car segment. Just like bitcoin broke free from its image as an in-game currency to become a global currency, Tesla’s vehicles were responsible for breaking a commonly held perception that electric cars of this generation can’t be relied upon to deliver performance.\n\n\n\nThe latest offering from Tesla was announced a couple of days ago, the new Tesla Model comes with an attractive specification with an efficient power pack that gives the new Model E a range of over 200 miles per charge and it is capable of reaching 0 to 60 miles per hours in less than 6 seconds. The company is currently accepting pre-orders on their website. In order to place his pre-order with bitcoin, Mason Borda first used the ShakePay service to create a single use bitcoin credit card into which he deposited about $1000 worth in bitcoin before paying same for pre-booking. Now he has to wait till next year to get the car after paying the remaining $34,000.\n\nBitcoin debit/credit cards, also known as crypto-cards have made it easier for people to pay with bitcoin at any point of sale terminal that accepts cards. These crypto-cards are connected to the user’s bitcoin wallet and work on Visa/MasterCard terminals like a regular debit card. Payments made using the crypto card will be deducted from the user’s bitcoin balance, while the merchant receives the settlement in fiat currency.\n\nIn the near future, the Bitcoin technology may very well find adoption in self-driving cars for maintaining records of the car movement when used on a sharing basis. As a part of the same system, bitcoin can be used to pay tolls, traffic fines and for repairs.\n\nREAD MORE: A Peek into the Future — Mobility-On-Demand with Self-Driving Cars and Blockchain Technology\n\nThe future is in the making, and Bitcoin is at its center!', 'Bitcoin is expected to play a major role in the retail sector by the end of this decade, shows a survey conducted by Infomentum. The results of the survey was published in the report - Beyond Digital.\n\nThe retail industry is one of the largest sectors in the world. The process of buying and selling goods has been around since the concept of money was introduced to mankind. Until now, the retail sector has not seen much change in the way trade is conducted. But in the coming years it may start bearing a new look resembling scenes from old science fiction movies. Bitcoin will also be included in this change, indicates a recent survey.\n\nThe survey was conducted by the research firm Infomentum in the United Kingdom. As part of the survey, employees working in the country’s retail sector were asked to participate in a poll where they were asked questions about the current and future outlook of the sector and the changes they are expecting in the future. responses from the participants were collected, analysed and published in the survey report titled “Beyond Digital”.\n\nAccording to the report, people are expecting the face of the retail sector to change in the next 3-4 years. These changes are expected to be in the form of alternative payment methods, displaying and showcasing the products, mode of delivery and on-demand custom products.\n\nThe need for change by technology adoption is considered absolutely necessary by most people in the retail industry. A majority of the survey participants believed that if their company/outlet continue being the same, then it may fall out of the competition by 2020. Bitcoin as a digital currency doesn’t form a big chunk of the economy at the moment, but in the coming years, it may potentially become one of the most widely used form of money for everyday expenses. A future like this will also coincide with the attempts being made by governments across the world to replace the use of cash as much as possible with electronic payments.\n\nThe survey has also pointed out an interesting trend where about 20 percent of the participants were pro-digital currency and they expect bitcoin and digital currency to become a regular affair by the end of this decade. It is an important statistical data point that can’t be ignored. If 20 percent of respondents forming the sample set were pro-bitcoin, then can a comparative analysis be done to identify the thoughts of people employed in other industries about bitcoin? If the results show a similar trend, then it is good news for bitcoin, as it means the bitcoin community may grow faster than it was expected earlier.\n\nOn the other hand, will the Bitcoin network be able to handle such a rapid expansion of the network and handle transactions, is something that should be considered. Some of the other things that can be expected to change soon in the recent industry include 3D printing terminals for people to choose things they want 3D printed on the spot, augmented reality based catalogues for customers to look and feel the product before they decide to spend on it and goods delivery using drones.\n\nInfomentum’s Beyond Digital full report can be accessed here.\n\nRef: Infomentum Img: Infomentum Disclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Depending on which country one resides in, there might be a slight improvement although a large part of the world is still working towards stabilization. If a new financial crisis were to take place tomorrow, things could get kind of interesting for Bitcoin to say the least.\n\nAlso read: BTCC’s Humorous Documentary on Bitcoin Mining in China\n\nA New Financial Crisis Is Not Unlikely\n\nDespite what financial experts may want the general public to believe, there is hardly any improvement in the world economy ever since the financial crisis hit in 2007. The trust relationship between banks and customers is hanging on by a thin thread, and the growing demand for new financial tools is only putting more stress on financial institutions.\n\nAt the same time, fiat currencies and the stock market remain rather volatile, while oil prices are not doing that much better in recent months. Everything that is linked to traditional finance is in a slum, and there are no visible signs for long-term improvements. In fact, things are looking rather bleak for 2016, and we are only in April so far.\n\nBack in January of 2016, a warning was issued how the world should brace for the impact of a new financial crisis. With the looming Brexit, the Eurozone is under a lot of duress, and the worst case scenario could see the entire Eurozone collapse. Although media headlines are stating how some countries are starting to show signs of recovery, the current equilibrium is very brittle, and it would not take much to send the economy back into recession.\n\nMoreover, a document was leaked by Wikileaks about a day ago, which showcases the current plans by the IMF. Among the topics discussed during this transcript of an internal IMF meeting are how Greece is facing another disaster, and how the organization is considering a Troika exit as well. Neither of these solutions is favorable for an economic recovery, yet they could individually lead to a new financial crisis.\n\nAn Interesting Situation For Bitcoin\n\nAs horrible as the thought of a new financial crisis is, there have been plenty of warnings about how things needed to change in 2007-08. Unfortunately, governments and central banks decided not to listen to these warnings, although some minor reforms have taken place in a few countries. But on a bigger scale, the economic situation has remained at status quo, rather than alleviating the stress of the financial crisis.\n\nThen again, a secondary financial crisis would push even more consumers and enterprises in the direction of alternative financial services and solutions. Bitcoin is an obvious contender in this regard, as it is the only viable global form of transferring value that is not dragged down by the banking ecosystem. Despite some of the flaws in Bitcoin that need to be addressed – such as the scalability issue – Bitcoin is a far more preferable financial solution than other services.\n\nGranted, there is still a mental entry barrier to overcome when switching from fiat currency and bank accounts to Bitcoin. That being said, the advantages outweigh the downsides, as users are in full financial control without relying on middlemen. Doing some research on the topic is necessary for everyday consumers, but it will be an eye-opener, to say the least.\n\nSource: Wikileaks\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Buy Photo Tent homes at Sean\'s Outpost.

Park Place, Room 104, Pensacola, Fl, 32505.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nInside a large clearing surrounded by tall, shady trees, swampland and a narrow dirt road, a woman named Rhonda is tidying up a single-person-tent that has served as her home since January. A small stack of books and single vase of fake flowers sit on the floor of her immaculately clean tent next to her twin mattress and floral comforter.\n\nRhonda, and 14 other people are camping on the 9 acres of land known as Satoshi Forest -- a refuge for the homeless started in 2013 -- located just off Massachusetts Avenue near West Pensacola\'s Mayfair neighborhood.\n\n""I\'ve never been homeless in my life,"" she said. ""I haven\'t worked in 15 years, haven\'t had to work really.""\n\nRhonda\'s husband died three days before Christmas and, shortly after his death, she was evicted from their apartment. She went to the Beacon Shelter, which was open only as a cold-weather shelter at the time, before a shelter employee told her about the forest and Sean\'s Outpost.\n\nBuy Photo (Photo: John Blackie/jblackie@pnj.com)\n\nSean\'s Outpost, a local homeless outreach organization, acquired the 9 acres of property in July 2013, now known as Satoshi Forest, and has allowed homeless people to camp on the site since October 2013.\n\nARCHIVE STORY\n\nAcross the clearing from Rhonda, a married couple, Cindy and Ricky, sit in lawn chairs watching the cardinals swoop into the birdhouses hanging from a nearby tree.\n\n""We were staying in a house on Gonzalez and T streets and it really wasn\'t safe -- there was a lot of drug usage and I was not OK with it,"" Cindy said.\n\nCindy and Ricky have been staying inside a large tent in the camp for a month and are grateful to be somewhere they feel safe and respected.\n\nBuy Photo (Photo: John Blackie/jblackie@pnj.com)\n\nSean\'s Outpost and Satoshi Forest co-founder Michael Kimberl said the organization and camp property was founded out of a need to help Pensacola\'s growing homeless population.\n\nKimberl noted the last point-in-time (PIT) count conducted by the Coalition of the Homeless in partnership with the department of Housing and Urban Development revealed more than 800 people sleeping outside at any given time.\n\n""We have roughly 300 shelter beds in the county, so that means at any given time there are roughly 500 people sleeping illegally in parks, on public property, behind bushes and grocery stores,"" Kimberl said. ""We wanted to provide a safe place to help some of those people out.""\n\nThe property is privately owned, and is zoned for camping, but is not a permitted campground. Kimberl and camp co-founders Jason King and his wife have experienced difficulties since working with Escambia County to decide what permits, if any, are needed in order for Satoshi Forest to continue functioning.\n\nARCHIVE STORY\n\n\n\nThe county recently served Kimberl with a cease-and-desist notice on March 10, and will have a special magistrate hearing on at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday to discuss the code they believe is being violated. The petition for the hearing before the Office of Environmental Enforcement Special Magistrate states County Code 4-7.13, which regulates temporary uses and structures, is being violated.\n\n""They\'ve said we can\'t have anyone staying in a structure on the property for more than 14 days a year,"" Kimberl said.

However, the surrounding neighborhood residents are unhappy with the camp’s location.\n\nRichard Grimes has lived on Fennel Road for 10 years and his backyard faces one of the camp entrances. He\'s started several petitions to have the camp shut down and has acquired over 200 signatures from Mayfair neighborhood residents in the last two years.\n\n""I think that a lot of those people really do need help and there is a need out there,"" Grimes said. ""It just does not need to be in a neighborhood.""\n\nGrimes\' daughter and grandson live across the street from him and he noted he was particularly concerned for the children in the area and what they might encounter, living so closely to the camp.\n\nGrimes recently purchased a section of land behind his home that travels along a privacy fence bordering one side of the camp, in order to put more distance between his property and the forest property. He is also expressed his concern relating to the controlled burns and open fires that take place inside the camp and said several other resident are concerned with breathing the smoke that occasionally rises from the forest.\n\n""You just have no idea who might be living back there,"" he said.\n\nHEARING INFORMATION\n\nWhat: Escambia County County Environmental Enforcement special magistrate hearing.\n\nWhen: 1:30 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nWhere: Escambia County Central Office Complex, 3363 W.

The confidant to chief executives of some the largest companies in the US worked on nearly $300bn worth of transactions last year, making him one of the top ranking lawyers in terms of deals announced. “Scott is widely recognised as one of the country’s leading M&A lawyers, advising the world’s largest companies on their most complex corporate transactions and governance issues,” said Brad Karp, chair of Paul, Weiss. Mr Barshay, who joined Cravath as a first year associate in 1991, advised Anheuser-Busch InBev last year in its $100bn-plus acquisition of SABMiller, the London-listed beer company. Other large deals he worked on include Heinz’s takeover of Kraft, where he provided legal counsel to 3G Capital Partners, the Brazilian private equity firm, and Schlumberger’s $13 acquisition of Cameron International, where he advised the seller. Other clients range from Honeywell to Avon Products. Most recently he has represented Starwood Hotels & Resorts in the sale process which saw Marriott International battling Chinese insurer Anbang in the fiercest bidding war in recent history. After several rounds of offers, Anbang dropped out and Starwood agreed to Marriott’s offer about $13.6bn. Mr Barshay has also provided counsel to several clients that came under pressure from activist shareholders, including Qualcomm, Xerox and Avon. A banker at a bulge bracket investment said: “Scott is just one of a kind\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009he lives for the deal and CEOs trust him a lot\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009he is one of the best deal lawyers of his generation.” His move comes at a time when large New York-based corporate law firms have been winning market share from smaller rivals. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; Cravath, Swaine & Moore; and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz advised on the most transactions in 2015 — the busiest year in the history of mergers and acquisitions, with global deal volume crossing the $5tn mark for the first time. Cravath advised on nearly $900bn worth of deals, second to Skadden, which worked on more than $1tn worth of transactions. Paul Weiss, which has about 950 lawyers across the globe and last year generated revenues of about $1.1bn, is best known for being one of America’s top litigation law firms. Although it has worked as a legal adviser on several high-profile private equity deals it has a smaller M&A practice. By hiring Mr Barshay it plans to become a bigger player in this area too. “The breadth and depth of Scott’s practice perfectly complement our firm,” said Robert Schumer, chair of Paul, Weiss’s corporate department.

04/04/2016,"['Jason Weinstein is a partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP and a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice in charge of cybercrime and organized crime. He is the Director of the Blockchain Alliance and a member of the advisory boards of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Coin Center and BitFury\n\nIn this opinion piece, Weinstein discusses why he believes the misconception that bitcoin is ""anonymous"" has hidden the fact that the technology actually better meets the needs of law enforcement.\n\nHere’s a newsflash: Bitcoin has an image problem.\n\nIf you ask the average person what words come to mind when they think of bitcoin, three of the most common responses will likely be ""anonymous"", ""untraceable"" and ""a currency for criminals."" But all of these common ideas about bitcoin are actually misconceptions.\n\nIn fact, every single one of them is wrong.\n\nThis may just be a problem of perception, but it can have very real consequences, as it can impact the attitudes of investors, lawmakers, regulators, enforcement agencies and the public toward this technology.\n\nWe need to deal with these perception issues head-on.\n\nNew twist, old problem\n\nAny technology worth adopting is adopted early by criminals. But, law enforcement has a long history of adapting in order to pursue criminals or terrorists who use ""new school"" technology to commit ""old school"" crimes.\n\nThey’ve done it over and over again.\n\nFrom pagers to burner cellphones to email to online chat to mobile devices to PayPal, just to name a few examples, law enforcement consistently has had to evolve as new technology designed for legitimate purposes is used to facilitate criminal activity.\n\nThere are many examples of this phenomenon, but perhaps none greater than the Internet itself. And perhaps the greatest challenge for law enforcement in investigating crimes involving the Internet is – wait for it – anonymity. Indeed, the problem of attribution – often referred to as ""putting fingers at the keyboard"" – is the most difficult part of any investigation of crime facilitated using online means.\n\nEvery day, agents and prosecutors have to figure out ways to tie a string of numbers and characters – whether that’s an ICQ chat name, IP address, MAC address or even an email address – to a particular human being. That process is made harder when that human being uses multiple IP addresses or chat names or adopts anonymizing techniques such as proxies or TOR.\n\nIt also doesn’t help law enforcement with attribution that Web-based communications providers don’t have \'know-your-customer\' requirements, so agents can’t necessarily have confidence in the accuracy of whatever user information is on file.\n\nYet, agents and prosecutors work to overcome those challenges with great success, and the solution often lies in analyzing data from multiple sources to try to zero in on the particular bad actor.\n\nBitcoin presents just the newest twist on that old problem.\n\nIt’s ironic that even though criminal and terrorist use of the Internet is rampant – and was from the very beginning – nobody thinks of the Internet as the ""network of criminals"".\n\nInstead, people think of the Internet as a place where we all work, shop, socialize, communicate, consume entertainment and learn. But it’s a measure of the extent of bitcoin’s image problem that every time a cybercriminal commits a ransomware or other cyberattack and happens to use bitcoins as a medium of payment, the case is characterized by the press and policymakers as a bitcoin problem and not an Internet or cybercrime problem. (For more on this issue, see Peter Van Valkenburgh’s excellent post at Coin Center).\n\nThe attribution challenge presented by bitcoin is far from unique. What is unique is that bitcoin actually provides some attribution advantages.\n\nSo wait, it’s not anonymous?\n\nIt’s often said that bitcoin is not really anonymous, but rather pseudonymous.\n\nWhat that essentially means is that a user’s bitcoin address is like an account number that stays with the user; if you can connect that address to a user, you can identify and trace all of the transactions in which that individual has participated using that address.\n\nIndeed, if the individual uses an exchange or wallet service to access the blockchain, then the bitcoin address is essentially like a bank account number, because the exchange or wallet service will maintain records linking the address to a particular individual, much like a bank maintains records establishing the owner of a bank account.\n\nThat’s not a perfect analogy, because one individual could have any number of bitcoin addresses, but is likely to have a limited number of bank accounts.\n\nBut as with banks, law enforcement would be able to obtain information about the address user by serving a subpoena or other lawful process. That’s one of the reasons we have seen, and will continue to see, enforcement actions taken at the ""on ramps"" and ""off ramps"" of the blockchain – to incentivize exchanges and wallet services to maintain compliance, so data will be there when law enforcement serves the subpoena.\n\nBut what if someone obtains bitcoins through a source other than a licensed exchange? What if the individual uses techniques for enhancing anonymity – like multiple addresses, or mixing services? Even then, the individual is not truly anonymous.\n\nOf course, the individual may leave a trail when exchanging bitcoins (however obtained) into fiat currency. But the individual may also leave a trail while engaging in transactions on the blockchain.\n\nThere are existing and rapidly improving techniques to help link those users to their bitcoin addresses and transactions using, among other things, analysis of transaction patterns to make connections among multiple addresses used by the same individual; mining (no pun intended) of data from social media and public sources; and analysis of IP addresses used to conduct transactions.\n\nAs for mixing services, individuals who rely on them are making a leap of faith, trusting that the service won’t cheat them and that the service isn’t keeping records that could be obtained by law enforcement. And of course, the bitcoins you get back from the service could themselves be dirty and be on law enforcement’s radar.\n\nAnd here’s the real attribution advantage: the traceability, searchability, and permanence of the blockchain.\n\nWhether a law enforcement agent identifies the owner of an address tomorrow or two years from tomorrow, the agent will then be able to trace back every transaction involving that address, all the way back to the beginning.\n\nMoreover, because the ledger is publicly accessible, law enforcement does not have to worry about what type of legal process is required to access the data. And because the ledger is borderless, law enforcement can get the data without having to go through a foreign government. That gives law enforcement the data it needs to ""follow the money"" in a way that would never be possible with cash.\n\nLaw enforcement is still getting up the learning curve on bitcoin, although the case against Carl Force IV, the former DEA agent convicted of stealing bitcoins during the Silk Road investigation, demonstrates that even at this early stage, law enforcement has already developed an impressive capacity to follow the money using the blockchain.\n\nAnd law enforcement’s capabilities in this area will only improve over time, particularly as new analytics tools are developed.\n\nOf course, innovators are coming up with new ways to increase privacy, whether on the bitcoin blockchain or through other types of cryptocurrencies, so law enforcement will continue to have to evolve and adapt to meet the challenges of new technology.\n\nIn the early days of commercial use of the Internet, law enforcement agencies got help from Internet companies to help them learn how the technology worked, so they could improve their capacity to go after criminals who misused that technology to facilitate their crimes. That effort went a long way toward dialing down concerns about the Internet. And through the Blockchain Alliance, we are trying to do the same thing for the blockchain.\n\nThe more people learn about bitcoin, the more they will realize that it’s friendlier to cops than it is to criminals.

So far, the company is reporting that the pre-sales activity on the Model 3 just might account for over $8b in sales. One customer even used Bitcoin to lock their new ride in.\n\nA new post by a user named “Mason” over at Medium goes through the process of how he/she ordered the Model 3. The chain of events was as follows:\n\nI just preordered an automobile that I have never seen or touched, which is propelled by electrons flowing through copper wires, that has a 0–60 of under four seconds and supposedly comes with no instrument cluster.\n\nI preordered this vehicle with an invisible currency that was invented by a pseudo-anonymous computer programmer who calls himself Satoshi Nakamoto and is likely not Japanese.\n\nI made this purchase using a service that dispenses ephemeral credit cards made by some Canadian guy that I met online named Jean. Whom I met after placing a $400 Bitcoin bounty for creating a Bitcoin payable API endpoint that could order and deliver me pizza upon payment.\n\nUsing Bitcoin to pre-order a Tesla is quite an interesting statement. Not procedurally, because as we know (and Mason has documented) of course, it can be done. What is fascinating is that now these process gaps that once kept Bitcoin out of the everyday economy are evaporating. According to the account above, it sounds like “Mason” had to spend a little bit of time on this. I think we can all imagine a not too distant future whereas all of these hurdles have disappeared.\n\nOne of the leading Silicon Valley companies, Tesla Motors, is now officially a part of the “internet of money.” Is this the first time that someone has used Bitcoin to pay for a Tesla? Maybe, maybe not. But that is not important. What’s important is that in a year that is shaping up to be pivotal for Bitcoin and blockchain, more stories like this are emerging.\n\nIn the article, Mason quotes Steve Coast as saying, “The world will only get weirder!” True, but as Mason implies, don’t forget to enjoy the drive!\n\nFeatured image from Tesla.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam recently appeared on the 1776 Podcast, where he was asked about the adoption of Bitcoin in the United States and international markets. While there has been a lot of noise related to merchant acceptance and use cases in developing countries, the reality is there still aren’t as many people using Bitcoin today as some expected.\n\nEhrsam noted that there probably aren’t that many Bitcoin users in the developing world, which is often touted as one of the technology’s major demographics. He then covered two of the current roadblocks to greater Bitcoin adoption: education and ease-of-use.\n\nWhat’s Holding Back Bitcoin Adoption?\n\nIn Ehrsam’s view, the knowledge gap is what’s holding back Bitcoin at this point in time. While it’s easy for technically-savvy individuals to understand why Bitcoin is useful (or may be useful in the future), the average person on the street is still looking at the digital value-transfer system with bewilderment. Ehrsam explained:\n\n“There’s definitely a huge knowledge gap …. There are two primary things that I think will close that gap. One is some base level of knowledge. The second is services that are built such that these people don’t really have to understand the underlying protocols in the first place.”\n\nAt this point, it’s unclear to the moms, dads, grandparents and less technically inclined friends of Bitcoin users why they should use this new technology. The vast majority of users are still simply holding the digital store of value as a speculation, and potential new users are often turned off by the complexities associated with Bitcoin applications. This is a point that Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winkless and Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce have all made in the past.\n\nMost People Don’t Know How Email Works\n\nEhrsam also stated that completely new technologies are also sometimes extremely difficult to grasp, even for highly educated individuals. He pointed to the infamous “What is Internet?” clip from an episode of “The Today Show” in the ‘90s as an example of this phenomenon.\n\nEhrsam also noted that, even today, most people don’t understand how various Internet protocols work. He stated:\n\n“The reality of today is you could go up to many different people on the street ? maybe even around the offices here [at 1776] ? and say, ‘Hey. How does email work? How does SMTP work (the protocol that underlies email)?’ I’m guessing that less than 10 percent of people could give you a solid answer, but the reality is that we all use it every day anyway.”\n\nBitcoin Needs More Intuitive Apps\n\nAlthough many people do not understand Bitcoin, that does not mean it cannot be a useful technology for large amounts of people. In Ehrsam’s view, the key to mainstream adoption is building intuitive apps that normal people can use. He explained:\n\n“I think it’s our job in the ecosystem to create software and applications, which bridge the gap without necessarily this entire learning process on the underlying technology, which really is irrelevant, I think, to the end-customer.”\n\n1776 co-founder Evan Burfield, who was also featured on the recent podcast, added:\n\n“I don’t think an entrepreneur trying to do business across multiple African countries needs to understand the concept of Bitcoin miners to figure out that he can do business in a more secure way with lower transaction costs [via Bitcoin].”\n\nEhrsam agreed and added, “The particulars are less relevant.”\n\nSome Bitcoin applications, such as Abra and Freemit, are moving toward the model of hiding the underlying technology from their users. This strategy may continue to expand as Bitcoin startups begin to target individuals outside of the digital currency community.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The inexpensive tool can store any amount of bitcoin, with the option to add more over time.\n\n“Give an Opendime to anyone and they don\'t need to worry that you can take back the funds later,” Opendime\'s website says. “You\'ve got the private keys in the device.”\n\nIt\'s far safer to receive an Opendime than a paper wallet. The private key, held inside the device, is generated in a secure zone that isn\'t accessible to anyone, even the originator, until the wallet is physically broken open.\n\n- Opendime\n\nThe device went on sale Thursday, for the price of US$29 for a pack of three. Two days later, the company reported selling out of the initial batch, which ships during the month of May. However, the website is still taking orders, and the next batch is scheduled to ship in either June or July.\n\nOpendime\'s parent company, Coinkite, was best known for their popular bitcoin multisignature wallet. A week ago the legacy bitcoin company discontinued the offering, preferring to concentrate on “less centralized services.”\n\nThe company will continue to sell a merchant point of sale terminal, although they are ""working on a new decentralized/stand-alone unit"" to replace the existing terminals with. Also, they are considering several other hardware products, including a secure hardware wallet with a printer built in.\n\n\n\nOpendime’s caseless, bare-silicon appearance was designed to both save money and to make tampering extra easy to spot.\n\n\n\nWhen you first receive an Opendime from the manufacturer, the units are empty and don\'t have any private keys. After plugging it into a computer, using a standard USB port, the device will generate the keys for you. The device then acts as a read-only wallet, storing the public key and a handy QR code in files on the device.\n\n- Opendime\n\nThe open-source software running on the device stores 53 files on it, mostly divided into three folders. The first is for the general operating system, the second for use when it is still in read-only mode. The third folder, which is only accessible after the device has been broken, allows access to the private key.\n\nAt the center of an Opendime card is a long, narrow strip that will snap off when pushed from either side, causing irreparable damage. Once that piece has been broken out, the contents of the third folder will change, and the private key will be revealed. The device is considered insecure and disposable at this point, and funds should be moved to another wallet.\n\nBitGo engineer and founder of the bitcoin node statistics site Statoshi.info, Jameson Lopp, tweeted about Opendime soon after launch, declaring it the ""first bitcoin bearer bond,"" while noting that Opendime is ""Great for privately trading batches of ‘investment’ coins.""\n\nHe noted that payments can be taken off-chain using the device, by simply trading Opendimes as cash, which could lead to ""limitless scalability"" in bitcoin.\n\n- Opendime\n\nOpendime could also help alleviate any future threat to Bitcoin\'s fungibility. As the science of blockchain forensics develops, tracking tools like SABR, Coinalytics, and Numisight threaten to make certain, specific bitcoins worth less than other coins of the same amount, by marking them as illegitimate or stolen.\n\nHaving a way to get bitcoins off the blockchain, and transacted in the physical world, breaks the trail, and makes forensics services useless as a weapon against fungibility. Until now, paper wallets and physical coins like the Casascius coin were the only way of doing this, and both come with their own security risks.\n\nPhysical bitcoin representations with added wallet functionality are perhaps the closest relative to Opendime. They can be passed around in use as money, and often hide a private key inside them. However, physical bitcoins have to have their private key generated, printed out, and assembled by someone.\n\nThis problem is also inherent in paper wallets. Would-be customers who want to keep large amounts of bitcoin on them generally think twice before trusting the supplier. Even worse, anyone in possession of a paper wallet can typically open it up and see the private key along the way, making paper wallets completely useless as a form of money.\n\nUnit price is also in Opendime\'s favor. Made out of rare or precious metals, the highly ornamental physical bitcoins look great, but are less likely to be passed around as money. Currently sold for 0.39 Bitcoin, or about US$163, per coin, Casascious coins are priced at almost 18 times the price of an Opendime, and other physical coins aren\'t that much cheaper.\n\nIf the price of an Opendime ever comes down to a price point of a dollar or less, perhaps we\'ll see them in use as money far more as people start to think of them as actually disposable. Until then, bitcoiners can happily use them as a private, longer-term storage device, ideal to keep savings on in a safe or even for transferring funds to others on with a high degree of privacy, reducing blockchain transactions in the meantime.', ""The blockchain consortium led by R3CEV, a group of 42 global banks working on blockchain applications that includes JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and more, is now working with tech giant Microsoft.\n\nThe full partnership, which was first tested back in January with a smaller group of R3’s members, gives the consortium access to more than just Microsoft's platform of Blockchain-as-a-Service tools.\n\nCharley Cooper, managing director of R3, told CoinDesk that the formal partnership came after a series of tests with other potential partners, including Amazon and IBM. A dedicated team of five Microsoft employees is now working directly with consortium members.\n\nCooper told CoinDesk:\n\n“Throughout the experiments we started to realize that the level of expertise they gave us in terms of the man-power and the technology actually made them the ideal partner.”\n\nUnder the terms of the non-exclusive deal, Microsoft will provide access to 45 cloud-based tools on its Azure platform, including those created by ConsenSys, Ripple, Eris Industries, Factom, BitPay, and other startups working with the technology.\n\nIn addition to the software, Microsoft has set aside a team of “dedicated technical architects, project managers, lab assistants and support services” to work with consortium members around the world.\n\nThe partnership comes after 11 of R3’s consortium members, including Barclays, Credit Suisse, and Well Fargo, completed a test of private version of the Ethereum network using Microsoft’s Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform in January.\n\n“R3 and member banks will experiment and learn faster, accelerating distributed ledger technology deployment,” said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of global business development at Microsoft, in a statement. “What’s more, our collaboration brings to light tremendous opportunities to rethink business processes and transform entire industries.”\n\nIn a separate blog post written by Johnson as part of the Microsoft Envision conference in New Orleans, she wrote that the partnership will help streamline back-office operations, “potentially saving billions of dollars.”\n\nOver the coming weeks and months Cooper says he expect the full scope of the partnership with Microsoft will expand, depending on how the software company and the banking consortium work together.\n\nCooper said:\n\n“Where this raises the stakes is rather than just a couple experiments we view this as a long term partnership that will expand.”\n\nImage via R3\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Using its Bitcoin wallet, Wiper recently launched a new functionality called Wiper Film to help filmmakers and online digital content providers monetize their content and maximize their profit with Bitcoin micropayments.\n\nThe company had previously raised $2.5 million in seed funding from sole investor and Intermedia and Unison founder Michael Choupak, to develop a unique set of cryptographic functionalities which encrypts all incoming and outgoing messages and HD calls.\n\nThe core concept of the Wiper application was inspired by the frustration that co-founders Manilo Carrelli and Michael Choupak felt while using conventional messaging platforms such as Whatsapp, Facebook and Skype, which do not allow users from removing their messages and content due to compliance issues. Anyone on the Wiper network can instantly and permanently delete sensitive user data and messages from the Wiper database and servers.\n\nTo provide an additional level of security to its users, Wiper also developed and integrated its Bitcoin wallet, which allows Wiper messenger users to send micropayments to each other with a touch of a button, securely and instantly. The wallet is the basis for the new Wiper Film functionality.\n\nWiper Film is a $4.99 a month subscription available for all Wiper messenger users that grants access to hundreds of independent films. Content providers will receive a fair share of the revenue in Bitcoin, that will be paid through Wiper Bitcoin wallets. In essence, Wiper Film is like traditional advertising networks Google AdSense or YouTube advertisements, which incentivizes content providers with an appropriate share of the ad revenue based on the popularity of the content. But instead of using existing payment methods such as PayPal or bank wire transfers, Wiper Film pays its filmmakers in Bitcoin.\n\nOne major advantage for filmmakers on the Wiper network is that they are able to receive Bitcoin payments with a minimum threshold that is substantially lower than the payment thresholds of Google and other leading advertising networks. Since Bitcoin micropayments are far cheaper than conventional payment methods, digital content providers will be able to receive their share of the income in smaller dividends.\n\nOn Google for example, content providers are required to wait until they reach a minimum threshold of $100 before cashing out. While major filmmakers and digital content providers drive tens of thousands of dollars per month in profit, freelance and independent filmmakers generate a much smaller income and thus struggle to reach that threshold each time they publish or release their content.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin payments are instantaneous. That means that digital content providers on the Wiper network will no longer have to wait for a week to two to receive their payments, unlike Google or AOL advertising networks, which require 5 to 10 business days as a minimum payment settlement period for users.\n\nThe Wiper team raised an additional $2 million from its previous investor Michael Choupak and plans to focus on the development and distribution of Wiper Film throughout 2016.', 'A Florida court has frozen the assets of the digital currency exchange Cryptsy and placed it under receivership, months after it collapsed amid claims that it had been the target of a hack.\n\nThe court-appointed monitor, James Sallah, was selected after a request by the plaintiffs in a class action law suit filed against the exchange in January.\n\nThat lawsuit stemmed from problems with customer fund withdrawals that had worsened for months before withdrawals and trading activities were suspended entirely. Prior to its shutdown, Cryptsy said that it had outstanding customer liabilities of nearly $10m in bitcoin.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by CoinDesk, Sallah was given administrative control over the assets and management of Project Investors, the operator of Cryptsy.\n\nApproval of the receivership request followed a 28th March hearing at which the legal representatives of Lorie Ann Nettles, the wife of CEO Paul Vernon and one of the defendants named in the case, did not object to the receivership request.\n\nThe order states:\n\n“The powers of the officers, directors, employees, and agents of Cryptsy are hereby suspended. Such persons and entities shall have no authority with respect to Cryptsy’s operations or assets, except to the extent as may hereafter be expressly granted by the Receiver. The Receiver shall assume and control the operations of Cryptsy and shall pursue and preserve all of its claims.”\n\nNotably, Vernon has not been served in the case nor has he responded to it in court. Vernon, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, told CoinDesk in January that he was traveling in China.\n\nThe exchange is currently offline, with a notice stating that it is in under maintenance.\n\nUnder receivership\n\nThe order grants the receiver power to take control of “all cryptocurrencies, monies, funds, property, and other assets” and to oversee any claims against the exchange. The order prohibits anyone with control of Cryptsy assets from selling or transferring them.\n\nSallah is also empowered to subpoena information related to the company, and the defendants named in the case are ordered to provide accounting details dating back to January 2013.\n\nFurther, Sallah will submit a report on the company’s viability and his recommendations for its future within thirty days. In December, CEO Vernon told a Florida divorce court that he expected Project Investors to fail as a result of “a downturn in profits”.\n\nSallah also has the power to direct the business activities – or closure – of Cryptsy, depending what happens in the weeks ahead. Past examples of corporate receivership in the bitcoin space include Butterfly Labs, which was placed in temporary receivership in late 2014 following a request by the Federal Trade Commission. Butterfly Labs settled claims against it earlier this year.\n\nAttorney David Silver, representing one of the two law firms involved with the suit, told CoinDesk that the court approval starts a new phase in which an accounting of the exchange will be performed.\n\n“This is just a slow moving process that unfortunately our clients were involved with, and like any investigation we have to get all our facts in a row, we have to cross our T’s and dot our I’s to make sure we’re doing this in a process that’s court approved,” he said. “This is one step in that approval process.”\n\nThe full court order can be found below:\n\n2016-4-4 -- De 33 - Order Appointing James Sallah as Receiver-Corporate Monitor for Cryptsy\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

04/05/2016,"['Aime Williams APRIL 6, 2016 10 Barclays is linking up with Circle Internet Financial, a US mobile payment start-up backed by Goldman Sachs that uses bitcoin to transfer central bank currencies, as digital money increasingly moves into mainstream finance. It is the first time a European bank has allowed a digital currency company to use its infrastructure — enabling it to transfer sterling and euros — according to the two companies. Boston-based Circle, which is valued at $250m, is expanding into Europe after launching a dollar transfer service for US users late last year. From Wednesday the payment app — which transfers dollars by first converting them to bitcoin — will also be able to transmit sterling between users of the app by linking to their debit cards. The tie-up with Barclays means Circle will be able to move sterling across the blockchain — a public ledger where bitcoin transactions are verified and recorded. Users will be able to exchange sterling and dollars immediately and free of charge. The move was welcomed by the UK Treasury, with economic secretary Harriett Baldwin saying that Circle’s partnership and UK launch were “major milestones”. Jeremy Allaire, chief executive and founder of Circle, said the app would add euros “in coming months”, and had plans to add Asian currencies in the future. Barclays said it was interested in “accelerating positive uses of blockchain”. Using the blockchain means that money can be exchanged without using a bank clearing system. Mr Allaire said the financial services industry did not fully realise the potential of the open-source blockchain, concentrating instead on developing its own closed versions based on similar technology. Bitcoin: the Satoshi Nakamoto riddle Play video Barclays is among nine of the largest investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, which are working on developing common standards for blockchain technology in an effort to broaden its use across financial services. Banks, exchanges and settlement houses are exploring ways to harness the much-hyped technology to reshape many of their daily operations, from upgrading back-office systems and outsourcing billions of dollars in costs to automatic execution of contracts. In depth Bitcoin As interest in Bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currencyFurther reading However, Mr Allaire said that blockchain would sooner disrupt the mobile payments industry, calling it a “blank slate” for innovators. “Payments are the next thing to be commoditised as a free service,” he said. Alongside Goldman Sachs, the company is backed by Jim Breyer’s Breyer Capital, Oak Investment Partners, Accel Partners and General Catalyst. Circle launched its first product, a mobile app for storing and transferring bitcoin, in late 2014 and says it has attracted customers in the “six figures” across 100 countries.

The only information that’s decentralized is whatever the members choose is necessary.\n\nIn a blog post published today, R3’s chief technology officer and the man in charge of the project, Richard Gendal Brown, described one of the key differences between Corda and what most people in the industry think of when they imagine a blockchain.\n\nBrown wrote:\n\n""We are not building a blockchain. Unlike other designs in this space, our starting point is individual agreements between firms... We reject the notion that all data should be copied to all participants, even if it is encrypted.""\n\nOther key differences include that the developers of Corda, who include chief engineer James Carlyle, and lead platform engineer Mike Hearn, focused from the beginning on the legal language around how disputed agreements are resolved and on concerns unique to regulated financial companies.\n\n""We need to make it easy to write business logic and integrate with existing code,"" wrote Brown, who was hired from IBM in September to lead the project. ""We need to focus on interoperability and we need to support the choreography between firms as they build up their agreements.”\n\nUnlike bitcoin\'s blockchain which distributes the entire history of transactions among its nodes, Brown highlighted that in Corda only verified transactions are shared.\n\nRegulators are given ""supervisory observer nodes"" from which they can monitor the system, a functionality that is being built into blockchain systems, including Overstock\'s tØ platform.\n\nEarly today Bloomberg reported that R3\'s consortium members, who participated in creating the tool, will be testing Corda over the coming weeks.

The platform is anonymous, but the developers aren\'t yet building in anonymising software like Tor, so as not to encourage flagrantly illegal ""misuse.""\n\nOpenBazaar is a wild vision — with dozens of unanswered questions\n\nOpenBazaar\'s vision is, fundamentally, a new way to do business online. Inspired by the decentralised file-sharing protocol BitTorrent and the fiercely libertarian digital currency bitcoin, it wants to create a kind of truly free online market without middlemen, where merchants and customers are bound only by their own morality.\n\n""We\'re giving [people] the option to engage in a kind of human interaction that doesn\'t exist now,"" developer Sam Patterson told Wired in 2014.\n\nBack in March it did a ""testnet"" release, a kind of beta release that uses fake ""testnet"" bitcoins to iron out any kinks and bugs ahead of the official launch.\n\nThe trial was a success: It was downloaded 25,000 times, with more than 3,000 items listed, OpenBazaar says on its blog. But there are still huge questions hanging over the project — ones that Hoffman accepts he doesn\'t have all the answers to and that will become clear only over the coming weeks and months.\n\nFor example: Will the value proposition of lower fees be enough to persuade ordinary merchants and customers to start using OpenBazaar? Will people trust the technology? Will people trust the decentralised libertarian philosophy behind it? Will the platform be overrun by illegal or immoral goods, despite the developers\' stated intentions? Will normal people be scared off by the existence of these illegal and immoral goods on the platform? Will law enforcement consider OpenBazaar\'s developers criminally liable for building an uncensorable marketplace that can be used for illegal activities? Will it even work properly?\n\nWhatever happens, it\'s going to be an exciting ride. So sit back and enjoy the show.', 'Bitcoin payments startup BitPagos is now giving its wallet users access to credit through its Ripio wallet offering.\n\nAt launch, the offering will be available to a select number of users in Argentina, who will be able to borrow between $500 and $1,000 in bitcoin directly from the service, with credit extended based on the user\'s annual salary. Users would then pay back the loan in three or six-month installments, plus interest.\n\nRipio and BitPagos CEO Sebastian Serrano said his team is seeking to make the digital currency more accessible for online consumers.\n\nSerrano told CoinDesk:\n\n""Right now if you’re a bitcoin user, you’re a holder of a debit card, in terms of making a payment. You need to fund your wallet by buying bitcoins, and then when you’re spending, you’re spending your actual funds, it’s money that you have.""\n\nFurther, the company stressed the benefits to this system over more traditional financial products, noting it requires no credit card, bank account or account maintenance fees.\n\nAt launch, Ripio is working with select merchants to trial the payments service, including local e-commerce startup Avalancha, which began accepting bitcoin last year. Avalancha will give 10% discounts to customers who buy on credit with bitcoin.\n\nSerrano said Ripio has been working on the concept for over a year, and that he sees it as yet another way the community can use the bitcoin network as a rails for payment.\n\n""We’ve been focused on building solutions that solve people’s problems,"" he said, adding: ""This is a way to make payments or allow our consumers to do payments in a more seamless way.""\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitPagos.\n\nMobile credit image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The records expose the details of offshore companies controlled by these prominent personalities.\n\nControlling, or being related to offshore companies is in no ways illegal by itself, however, the records released by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and the ICIJ (International Consortium of Investigative Journalists) show examples of neglection of laws, tax evasion, corruption, and abuse of political power.\n\nMossack Fonseca, the shell companies incubator\n\nThe leaked Panama Papers come from an obscure source, a law firm called Mossack Fonseca.\n\nMossack Fonseca is a law firm based in the tax haven of Panama. It is the world’s fourth largest law firm to set up offshore companies. It is an obscure and secretive but a very powerful law firm.\n\nWhat is interesting is that there is no proof to implicate any of Mossack Fonseca’s clients for any wrongdoing, even though as per ICIJ, in its list of customers, it has Ponzi schemers, drug kingpins, tax evaders, and at least one jailed sex offender.\n\nThe law firm also refuses to discuss any case of individual legal misconduct citing client confidentiality as the reason, however it is known to go to great lengths to fortify its customers’ secret blueprints.\n\nIn fact, as per ICIJ, in Nevada, the firm removed physical records from its Las Vegas office, and had its technical experts remove all e-copies of the records to protect its clients from a legal action by the US District Attorney’s Office.\n\nGlobal array of crime and corruption\n\nMossack Fonseca has very shady records. For example, it has worked with at least 33 companies or people that have been blacklisted by the US government due to the evidence of them being involved in extreme legal wrong-doings such as terrorism, drug trafficking, and aiding fascist regimes like North Korea.\n\nThe firm employs some of the best and controversial names in the public image management industry, thanks to which it has at least been able to manage a low profile if not a positive one.\n\nHowever, since the last few years, it has been under strict scrutiny by various countries. The law firm was fined by the British Virgin Islands in both 2012 and 2013 for violating anti-laundering laws. In early 2015, German authorities raided its office and private homes in Frankfurt, and in 2016, it is facing investigations for money laundering and bribery in Brazil. These leaks will not do much good to soften the stance of governments towards Mossack Fonseca.\n\nMoney laundering with Bitcoin can only work for small players\n\nAll the flake Bitcoin receives for abetting money laundering aside, is it actually possible to launder such huge amounts of money with Bitcoin?\n\nThe general consensus seem to be, no. There are mainly two areas where it seem to fail: scale of Bitcoin, and pseudo-anonymity.\n\nBitcoin, as of now, is not large enough to be able to hide large sums of money. Even a small fraction of the amount of money that is allegedly being laundered in the Panama Papers in Bitcoin would cause a significant increase in price of Bitcoin for no one to notice.\n\nDominik Zynis, founder of a stealth company utilizing blockchain technology, agrees and says that it will probably take Bitcoin another 10-20 years to get to such a scale. Tone Vays, head of research at BraveNewCoin, thinks money laundering with Bitcoin can only work for small players.\n\nVays explains to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Due to the price volatility and the fact that there is very little cumulative value on the Bitcoin Blockchain, this will only be useful for very small players who are believers in the Bitcoin technology.”\n\nBlockchain transactions are actually only pseudo-anonymous\n\nThe other is of course the issue of anonymity.\n\nDavid Mondrus, owner of FreeMasonStore and a Bitcoin expert, says:\n\n“Real anonymity on BTC is very hard if not impossible. There have been reports of academics using statistical analysis to associate related flows and to de-anonymize them. Until we see something like Dark or ZCash launched, high volumes and checked for anonymity, I wouldn\'t rely on it (even) for “(tax) avoidance"".”\n\nAccording to popular uninformed beliefs, Bitcoin transactions are completely anonymous, and therefore the lack of transparency provides an incentive to criminal activities. However, blockchain transactions are in reality only pseudo-anonymous. That is, even though the identity of the people involved in the address is not visible to anyone, but the addresses and the amounts transferred are publicly available.\n\nThe ownership of addresses is revealed to the people from whom a payment is received on a particular address. The fact that the blockchain ledger is public provides great transparency against money launderers.', 'While many people take the view that Bitcoin is dying or failing due to its current issues with governance and scalability, Blockchain Capital founder and managing partner Brock Pierce believes this current controversy is a good sign. In his view, the fact that there are so many transactions on the network should be seen in a positive light because it’s a sign of the technology’s success.\n\nIn a recent interview with Epicenter Bitcoin, Pierce explained his point of view on the Bitcoin block size debate and how it is currently causing uncertainty in the market.\n\nScalability Is a Good Problem to Have\n\nThe key point that Pierce, who is also the chairman of the board at the Bitcoin Foundation, wanted to make in regard to Bitcoin’s scalability issues had to do with the perspective that most people take on the topic. Instead of the usual, negative view, Pierce stated:\n\n“Bitcoin is so successful ? it’s growing exponentially ? and as a result of that, we’re running into scalability issues.”\n\nPierce went on to note that scalability is an issue that often impacts the most successful companies and technologies. He explained:\n\n“These are the problems that Facebook has. This is the problem WhatsApp has. This is the problem of very, very successful technologies, so let’s make sure that we understand that we’re not talking about Bitcoin as a failure; we’re saying, ‘Bitcoin is a success, and as a result of that, we need to scale it.’”\n\nPierce then added, “Bitcoin is becoming a victim of its own success.”\n\nNot Willing to Say He Has a Solution\n\nAlthough Pierce believes that Bitcoin’s scalability issues will likely be solved eventually, he does not want to say that he has all the answers. For this decision, he prefers to defer to the people who have been developing and scaling Bitcoin up to this point. Pierce stated:\n\n“I don’t think I’m the person who’s best qualified to say, ‘This is the right approach.’ ... I’m going to defer to the Core developers. I spend a lot of time talking with many of them, trying to understand why they have differing views, and then try to help bring people together so people can understand concerns that another might have, so we reach consensus sooner rather than later.”\n\nThe Blockchain Capital founder also pointed out that Bitcoin developers are issuing their own proposals for how to scale the system, and Bitcoin’s governance system should be able to take care of the rest. In the past, Pierce has compared the developers, miners, companies and stakeholders in Bitcoin to a system of checks and balances.\n\nScaling Bitcoin Is Causing Uncertainty in Bitcoin Market\n\nAlthough he’d like to see the system scale sooner rather than later, Pierce seems prepared to leave this decision to the experts. Having said that, he also understands that the current controversy is causing uncertainty in the Bitcoin market.\n\n“Financial markets really hate ? they dislike ? uncertainty,” he noted.\n\nPierce also explained how the current issues around the block size limit and governance are affecting the view of Bitcoin from the outside:\n\n“The people who were thinking about getting involved, the people that like the technology, and the people that had ambitions or plans to play here ? a lot of those people are being turned off by what I like to think of as self-inflicted wounds.”\n\nOne of the final points Pierce made on this matter is the effect a hard fork to another development team could have on the Bitcoin price. Although he said he doesn’t have a crystal ball, and hindsight would be preferred in the development of an opinion on this, Pierce stated:\n\n“We could end up seeing a hard fork [away from Bitcoin Core]. I think that’s going to end up having a negative impact on price in the short term. In the long term, it might be healthy.”\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

This new protocol layer built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain has received a lot of attention and hype over the past couple of years, and a fix for transaction malleability via Segregated Witness has resolved some of the code and design complexities involved with the network.\n\nLightning Network co-creator Joseph Poon recently supplied some comments to CoinJournal in regards to the current status of the project and when it will be available for general use. Poon claimed a functional version of the Lightning Network should be ready this summer.\n\nTesting on SegNet\n\nAs of now, this particular implementation of the Lightning Network concept is being tested on SegNet, which is a test network for Segregated Witness. In his comments to CoinJournal, Poon stated:\n\n“We are currently testing Lightning against SegNet. Tadge Dryja and Olaoluwa Osuntokun have been integrating Segregated Witness in our software. In fact, I believe Tadge was the first person to make a witness block larger than 1MB on SegNet 3 when testing the mempool.”\n\nTadge Dryja is the other co-author on the original Lightning Network white paper. Recently, Olaoluwa Osuntokun has also been working on bringing more privacy to the network for micropayments.\n\nThe code for this project is available on GitHub, and Poon added, “It should be in a testable state on SegNet 4 very soon.”\n\nReady When Segregated Witness Goes Live\n\nWhen asked whether the Lightning Network will be available once Segregated Witness is merged into Bitcoin Core, Poon responded:\n\n“A basic, functional version of Lightning Network should be ready when the Segregated Witness soft-fork goes live on Bitcoin, presuming it gets merged and activated this Summer. Hopefully it gets in this Summer, as this will enable entirely new decentralized use cases for Bitcoin which were not possible before on any financial system due to custodial risk underwriting.”\n\nAt the recent 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo, Joseph Poon discussed how the Lightning Network causes people to reimagine the Bitcoin blockchain as a court for smart contracts rather than a simple payment network.\n\nIn another recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Bitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo claimed a feature-complete pull request for Segregated Witness should be made available this month (April 2016). Having said that, it could take more time for that pull request to be reviewed, tested, and approved by the development community. The recently released SegNet 4 is expected to be the last test network for Segregated Witness.\n\nMillions of Transactions Per Second\n\nWhile the Bitcoin network is currently limited to less than ten transactions per second, Joseph Poon contends that the Lightning Network will enable millions (and eventually billions) of possible transactions per second. Poon stated:\n\n“A single node on a reasonably fast internet connection will be able to process thousands of transactions per second. In aggregate across the entire network, the total capacity will be in the millions per second, even early on.”\n\nPoon added that there may be soft-fork optimizations that could be helpful for improving the Lightning Network in the future, but the biggest constraint up to this point has been transaction malleability, which is fixed by Segregated Witness.\n\nUpdate [10th April] Blockstream’s Rusty Russell has told CoinJournal that his Lightning Network prototype is also currently being adapted for SegNet 4. Russell doubts his version of the network will be available when Segregated Witness and other protocol changes implemented in SegNet 4 go live on Bitcoin’s mainnet. In terms of SegNet 4, the Blockstream Core Tech Engineer added, “It’s the last bitcoin protocol change required to make lightning a reality.”']"
04/06/2016,"['Barclays has become the first big British bank to form a partnership with a digital currency firm, social payments app Circle, which runs partly on bitcoin’s blockchain network and launched in the U.K. on Wednesday.\n\nIn what Britain’s Treasury called a “major milestone” in its push to make the U.K. the world’s capital for financial technology, or fintech, Circle was granted an e-money license by the Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K. watchdog—another first for a digital currency company.\n\nThe Boston-based start-up, which is backed by $76 million in venture capital and counts Goldman Sachs (gs) and investment firm Digital Currency Group among its investors, said the license would allow it to hold users’ money and to facilitate domestic and international payments.\n\nUnlike a traditional money transfer company, however, Circle offers its users the opportunity to send not just written messages along with their money transfers, but also emojis and even animated “GIF” videos, with no charge, following in the footsteps of China’s WeChat Pay and AliPay.\n\n“The founding vision for Sean and I was that money should work the way the internet works,” said Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who founded the company with fellow internet entrepreneur Sean Neville.\n\n“This is the thing that I think we’re all learning from the Chinese: that this merging of messaging, media and payments together really makes sense to people.”\n\nCircle launched in the United States at the end of last year, and is now allowing cross-currency transfers of pounds and dollars at rates that it says are better than other money transfer services, and with no added fee. It will soon also allow transfers in and out of euros, when it launches in the rest of Europe later in the year.\n\nBut if a customer is sending money to a country where Circle hasn’t yet launched, it is simply transferred into bitcoin, then transferred and settled within minutes via the blockchain network that validates bitcoin transactions. At the other end, the bitcoin is then transferred back into the currency of that particular country.\n\nBarclays (bcs) Corporate Banking is providing the account that Circle needs to store sterling for consumers, and the infrastructure to allow transfers from any UK bank account in and out of Circle.\n\n“We support the exploration of positive uses of blockchain that can benefit consumers and society,” said a spokesperson for the bank in a statement.\n\nBarclays’ support is something of a coup for Circle—banks are increasingly investing in blockchain technology, but have tended to shy away from any firm that is in the least involved in bitcoin because of the web-based digital currency’s links to the dark web and illicit online activity.\n\n“Circle’s decision to launch in the UK, and the firm’s new partnership with Barclays are major milestones,” said Britain’s Economic Secretary to the Treasury Harriet Baldwin.\n\n“They prove our decision to introduce the most progressive, forward-looking regulatory regime is paying off and cements our status as the world’s Fin Tech capital.”', 'Dual identity, battle against governments, competition from other cryptocurrencies, scalability among other factors make innovation inevitable if Bitcoin is to survive.\n\nIn a Vanbex Group report of April 4 2016, Brandon Kostinuk has compared the attempt to describe Bitcoin as a currency or an investment with trying to discern whether light is a particle or a wave. The correct answer of course is, it’s both, he says.\n\nIn his analysis, Kostinuk points out that Bitcoin faces a multitude of battlefronts that may obstruct it from further pushing into the mainstream, as a universally accepted currency.\n\nWhether from within, externally, or fundamentally, through design or accident, Bitcoin is up against the real-world pressures of accommodating to wide-spread use. Most notable is the question of scalability, which, if left unsolved, will almost certainly spell disaster for the invention of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n‘Developer fund’ could rescue Bitcoin\n\nPositive news arrived last week with the announcement of a $900,000 Bitcoin Developer Fund for MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, the institution’s first foray into the Bitcoin and blockchain world.\n\nThe money, which came from a range of Bitcoin-related (or dependent) companies will help fuel the continued work of Bitcoin Core developer Cory Fields, former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen and current Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan. The trio arrived under the wing of MIT last August, a saving grace from the funding constrictions as a result of the Bitcoin Foundation’s collapsing profitability.\n\nMotherboard’s Christopher Malmo has written a good piece on the $900k announcement titled, “To Survive Long Term, Bitcoin Needs a Break from the Real World.”\n\nIn his article Malmo comes to the following conclusion:\n\n“Taking it off the line and into the academic realm could just be the shot in the arm that bitcoin needs to move forward with new ideas. To move forward, it may just need a place to grow without these real-world constraints.”\n\nBitcoin is fighting on multiple fronts\n\nKostinuk notes that the problem is that the slew of issues (the battlefronts that Bitcoin is up against) will not suddenly cease, not to mention a key competitor currently surging in popularity coupled with backing from a particular tech giant. The crucial thing, as Van der Laan told CoinDesk in late January, is that “the time of discussion and planning is over for now and we need to move on with actually realizing the roadmap.""\n\nGoing back in time, in Cyprus, in 2013, amid the banking crisis, many Greek citizens looked to Bitcoin as a means of placing their money in a place the government could not reach. Put your feet in the shoes of government then and it’s quite clear why they would be hard pressed to accept an alternate unit of account or exchange as a viable option alongside their own sovereign fiat.\n\nThe Cyprus episode catapulted the cryptocurrency to new heights, as Guillaume Babin-Tremblay, executive director of the Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal, Que iterated. He said to Kitco News that “Bitcoins were growing slowly until Cyprus. Cyprus was the catalyst for the big increase in the price.”\n\nThe price sat at $40 per Bitcoin and then doubled within a couple of days, according to Babin-Tremblay, with Kitco News reporting, “Prices pushed towards $200, but dropped to about $60 after the banking crisis abated.” Bitcoin offered Cypriots, who were at risk of having assets seized by the Central Bank of Cyprus, a place to put their money outside the reach of governments.\n\nChina, Argentina, Iceland and Russia, with their slumping economy the target of international sanctions and duly battered by the collapse in commodity prices, are all home to economies that have fomented a need for investors to seek an alternative vehicle of investment. Right or wrong, this action, moving currency out of the domestic system, affects economic stability. Growth is also hindered when citizens move funds offshore for the obvious reasons that that money no longer feeds the national economy through taxation, consumer spending or on-hand capital for banks.\n\nThis is what investment in Bitcoin is tantamount to and, hence, the opposition to the cryptocurrency and the ensuing legislative battles. The above example is also demonstrative of how and why a digital currency gains value and can experience intense volatility. It’s quite circular in nature.\n\nBitcoin thrives as an investment\n\nOn one hand, it’s about demand, which in turn feeds the purchasing power of a currency. On the other hand, demand for investment in a particular currency oftentimes has to do with its purchasing power or value on the world market, otherwise, why invest?\n\nVenezuela is an interesting example. There is projections its economy could inflate by 700 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. This is the highest inflation rate in the world. The collapsing economy has driven entrepreneurs to Bitcoin as their preferred payment method. This type of economic environment feeds demand for the cryptocurrency. But the cryptocurrency is struggling to make a decisive choice. Relevancy as a legitimate currency, crypto- or otherwise, hangs in the balance with governments bearing down.\n\nPundits discuss Bitcoin’s prowess with a $6.3 billion market cap, compared to Ethereum’s cryptocurrency which, in second place, makes up just below $900 million in market cap at the time of writing this piece. However, value, as we’ve seen in Bitcoin’s own history, is relative. Governance is needed; action is needed, as Van der Laan had espoused.\n\nInnovation is key for Bitcoin to remain relevant\n\nFor the digital currency to move forward, beyond its current state of ambiguity the realization that a decentralized currency functioning via a laissez-faire environment or attitude does nothing to produce the most efficient, effective and secure monetary system.\n\nThe most talked of issue plaguing Bitcoin at the moment is the block size debate. At the current 1MB size, by design it was supposed to take around 10 minutes. Under current conditions, this timeframe can stretch to anywhere from 45 minutes to a couple of hours. We know the time it takes in comparison with a credit card and so on. Whether the delayed transaction time is a result of mining centralization in China is another debatable subject, just as the topic of the centralization of the mining network to the overall goal of Bitcoin itself is subject for discourse.\n\nBitcoin’s relevancy hangs in the winds of innovation and real-world action. The $900,000 injection from Bitcoin-based companies is a small price to pay to resuscitate their lifeline, a cryptocurrency that commands billions and in which their enterprises are based, for the most part. It all can evaporate, diminish just as Blackberry’s North American dominance vanished in the wake of competition.\n\nReturning to Venezuela: Consider why citizens would select Bitcoin versus any of the alternatives. It has nothing to do with computational algorithms of the cryptocurrency; it has everything to do with the current store in value presupposed by demand.\n\nBitcoin’s core developers must start to fight through the battlefronts, and soon, otherwise Mike Hearn’s parting words will run as true as any tautology ever could. As we know demand for a product is never guaranteed in this fiercely competitive environment and the items that plague Bitcoin, both internal and external, could spell its decline.', ""Funding Bitcoin development seems to have always been problematic.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin industry collectively has raised more than a billion dollars worth of investment over the past years, development of the Free and Open Source Software the industry largely relies on has always had trouble gathering sufficient funds and manpower for development. Several arrangements to raise funds have been tried over the years – but with varying degrees of success and longevity.\n\nBitcoin Core, considered by many to be Bitcoin's “reference client,” therefore, announced a “Sponsorship Programme” earlier this week. As the latest effort to raise funds, this program is intended to be an easy access-point for companies and other Bitcoin industry players to support Bitcoin Core developers and projects. Companies that decide to take part in the sponsorship program will join a, so-far, short list of entities that do already help fund Bitcoin Core development.\n\nThese are the main sources of funding as it currently stands:\n\nMIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative\n\nShortly after the effective bankruptcy of the Bitcoin Foundation a year ago, the three Bitcoin Core developers funded by this foundation – lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, former lead Gavin Andresen and Cory Fields – were hired by the then newly established MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative.\n\nThe MIT Media Lab is an interdisciplinary research laboratory headed by tech-veteran Joi Ito, while its Digital Currency Initiative is headed by former White House adviser Brian Forde. According to Forde, the Digital Currency Initiative intends to provide a neutral academic working environment for the developers.\n\nAll three developers on Digital Currency Initiative's payroll are said to enjoy almost complete freedom; they are even allowed to work on alternative Bitcoin implementations if they wish. (Andresen works for no single implementation in particular, and mostly switched his efforts to Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic over the past year.)\n\nNeither MIT nor the Media Lab or its Digital Currency Initiative put up the money to fund the developers themselves, however. Instead, the Digital Currency Initiative relies on “unrestricted gifts” from sponsors, including mining specialists BitFury and Bitmain, wallet service Circle, API-provider Chain, the Nasdaq stock exchange, venture capitalist Fred Wilson, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and others.\n\nBlockstream\n\nBlockstream was founded in 2014 by Bitcoin Core developers Gregory Maxwell, Dr. Pieter Wuille, Matt Corallo, Jorge Timón and Mark Friedenbach, as well as several non-Bitcoin Core developers including hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back and venture capitalist Austin Hill. Since its launch, the Montreal-headquartered company also hired developers Gregory Sanders, Patrick Strateman and Glenn Willen to work on Bitcoin Core. Another Bitcoin Core developer, Luke Dashjr, works for Blockstream as a contractor.\n\nBlockstream's main mission is the realization of sidechain technology, which the company has done with Elements and Liquid so far.\n\nBlockstream developers typically work toward this goal, which they say generally aligns with their own long-term vision for Bitcoin. But developers on Blockstream's payroll – who typically co-own the company as well – are also encouraged to work on Bitcoin Core development in a more general sense.\n\nAccording to Blockstream president Back, this is because “the company has an interest to see Bitcoin maintained, developed and scale.” Some of Blockstream's developers, like Wuille, work on Bitcoin Core-specific development almost exclusively.\n\nAs part of their contracts, all Blockstream developers also have time-locked bitcoins to ensure they are incentivized to work toward Bitcoin's success. These contracts also include so-called “morality clauses”: If Blockstream asks any of them to work against what they consider to be in Bitcoin's best interest, they can refuse to do so while still guaranteed a salary.\n\nSince its conception, Blockstream has grown to be one of the top-funded Bitcoin companies in the space, with total investments adding up to $76 million from various (institutional) investors including Horizons Ventures, AXA Strategic Ventures, Digital Garage and, again, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.\n\nChaincode Labs Inc.\n\nChaincode Labs Inc. is a New York-based cryptocurrency research and development company founded by Alex Morcos and Suhas Daftuar in 2014. While the two founders were not Bitcoin Core developers at that time, they set-out to research Bitcoin by getting involved with development, and have done so ever since.\n\nThe company is also self-funded by Morcos and Daftuar, meaning they essentially pay for their own development for Bitcoin Core through their company. This means that Morcos and Daftuar enjoy complete freedom to work on whichever project they like, and however they like.\n\nCiphrex\n\nCiphrex was founded in 2014 by Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo and his father Enrique Lombrozo. The San Diego-based software company is best known for mSIGNA, an enterprise-level secure Bitcoin wallet, and CoinSocket, an application development platform.\n\nAccording to Lombrozo, he contributes to Bitcoin Core because he believes in the future of this technology, and considers working with the world's top experts in the field a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Plus: “Someone needs to do it.”\n\nSince Lombrozo is both the Ciphrex's CEO and a Bitcoin Core developer, he can contribute to Bitcoin's reference client in whichever way he believes is most useful.\n\nCiphrex raised $500,000 through a Series A stock offering last year.\n\nBTCC\n\nFounded in 2011, Shanghai-based Bitcoin exchange, mining pool and wallet service BTCC is one of the oldest and largest Bitcoin companies in the world.\n\nTo support the Bitcoin ecosystem, BTCC recently hired Peter Todd to work on Bitcoin Core for a minimum of 14 hours a month. Todd is free to work on whichever Bitcoin Core-related projects he wants, “no strings attached,” on the one condition that he provides a weekly report on his development efforts. The arrangement will last for at least six months.\n\nBTCC raised $5 million in a Series A led by institutional investors Lightspeed China Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners in 2013.\n\nOther\n\nThe entities listed above are the most clear examples of companies and other Bitcoin industry players funding Bitcoin development. But it should be noted that this list is not conclusive, especially because there is significant gray area.\n\nSome companies (such as Bitware Co. and BitPay) fund development of alternative Bitcoin implementations, of which the code can potentially be forked and included in Bitcoin Core. Other companies (including Lightning, Blockchain and, again, Blockstream) fund development of lightning networks, which is technically not Bitcoin Core, but is closely intertwined as it works toward the same vision and mission for Bitcoin.\n\nDevelopers working for yet other companies (including 21 Inc. and LedgerX) provide somewhat informal support through documentation or other help. And, as mentioned, this list is not conclusive.\n\nAnd, of course, the “Sponsorship Programme” might add new names to the list soon."", 'Beyond the hype\n\nThe premise that blockchain is hype is false.\n\nWhat is hype? The Oxford Dictionary defines hype as, “promoting or publicizing (a product or idea) intensively, often exaggerating its importance or benefits.” The simple version, the hype is an exaggerated advantage. A benefit that doesn\'t align to the future reality of the product or service. As with many new technologies, there is excitement. However, the buzz and excitement around blockchain are more than hype; it\'s the realization for the potential to transform industries.\n\nMedia weighs in\n\nThought leaders from Forbes and Harvard Business Review have bought into the value of blockchain technologies. For example, Jerry Cuomo, an IBM Fellow and Forbes contributor in his February 2016 Forbes article, “Blockchain: The Foundation For The Future Of Transactions,” stated that “Blockchain has the potential to become the technological foundation for all electronic transactions conducted over the Internet.” Amy Webb, in her January 2015 Harvard Business Review article titled, “The Tech Trends You Can’t Ignore In 2015” stated, “Even if Bitcoin itself never really gains traction, blockchain technology has enormous promise.”\n\nIndustry joins the party\n\nIt\'s great that the media has received the mailer on the value of blockchain, but what about the industry? CISCO recently stated, “The next generation of the Internet is coming with Blockchain.” In February, Accenture launched a blockchain practice for financial services industry and entered into a partnership with announced a blockchain partnerships with Accenture, Broadridge & PwC showcasing that the “New practice will implement emerging technology that is projected to reduce financial services industry costs by more than $20 billion annually by 2021.” PwC on April 4, 2016, announced they have started a new global technology team to tap into the blockchain and have recruited 15 new leading technology and business specialists.\n\nDeloitte has anticipated the tipping point of blockchain would not be until 2027. In a recent report titled, “Blockchain. Enigma. Paradox. Opportunity"" Deloitte says that ""Ultimately, the blockchain is not just about cryptocurrencies and faster peer-to-peer payments.” On October 2015, Deloitte partnered with Colu, to bring the startup into new global markets. Colu allows users to issue and track their digital assets on its platform.\n\nThe industry is unifying and joining the blockchain revolution. R3 (R3CEV LLC) leads a consortium consisting of 43 financial companies (including Microsoft as of April 4, 2016) in the research and development of blockchain usage in the financial system. However, the fabric R3 is proposing is industry agnostic. Todd McDonald, the co-founder and head of strategy for R3, likely wouldn’t refer to blockchain as hype either. The industry has taken notice of blockchain.\n\nHistorical perspectives on innovation hype\n\nThe fact that in 2015, large investors invested over 1 billion into the blockchain technology doesn\'t persuade some colonialists. Remember the hype over the telegraph in the nineteenth century? The telephone has matured but hype? We all know how overstated the telephone was by the end of the nineteenth and start of the twentieth centuries. How about the buzz and overpromises of canals and railroads in the 1700\'s and 1800\'s? Hype probably isn\'t the best word to describe the development of railroads that was one of the most important phenomena of the Industrial Revolution. The list doesn’t seem to end and continues with the likes of automobiles, radios and then the jet engine, rockets and atomic energy into the 1950’ and 1960’s with biotechnology, nanotechnology, and genomics. Do we consider the canals, railroads, telegraphs, automobiles and cell phones hype? If these hyped technologies landed us here, imagine how blockchain can change society in the future.\n\nHype Cycle\n\nThe Gartner Hype Cycle, introduced in 1995 offers useful insights into the promise of emerging technology. The July 2015, Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies report, highlighted the phases of the hype cycle on emerging and collaborative tech. The five phases of the Hype Cycle include: innovation trigger (less than 2 years), peak of inflated expectations (2 to 5 years), trough of disillusionment (5 to 10 years), slope of enlightenment (more than a decade), and lastly the plateau of productivity (obsolesce is reached before the plateau). It could be argued that the Hype Cycle is not a cycle and that outcomes do not depend on the nature of the technology itself or that it’s less than scientific in nature without accounting for changes over time in the speed at which technology develops. However, it does effectively show how society feels about new technology and when historically inflated expectations and disenchantments should likely occur.\n\nCloud Hype Cycle\n\nIf we consider cloud to have started the innovation trigger phase in 2012, the phases of the cloud hype cycle would be the following: innovation trigger (2012 - 2013), peak of inflated expectations (2014 to 2018), trough of disillusionment (2019 to 2028), slope of enlightenment (beginning 2030), and lastly the plateau of productivity (if applicable, after 2028).\n\nBlockchain Hype Cycle\n\nIf we consider blockchain’s innovation trigger phase started in 2014, based on when serious investors began to weigh in, the phases of the blockchain hype cycle would be the following: innovation trigger (2014-2015), peak of inflated expectations (2016 to 2020), trough of disillusionment (2021 to 2030), slope of enlightenment (beginning 2030), and lastly the plateau of productivity (if applicable, after 2030). The below charts illustrate the phases of the Hype Cycle showing visibility over time and expectations over time. If you’re looking for additional sources on the Hype Cycle Jackie Fenn and Mark Raskino, have an excellent book titled, ""Mastering the Hype Cycle: how to Choose the Right Innovation at the Right Time.”\n\nwikipedia.org\n\nBeyond Finance\n\nThe paper, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, by the individual or group called Satoshi Nakamoto, was released in 2008. If this is the only framework used to evaluate blockchain, that would be a narrow view of blockchain\'s potential. Minimizing the value of blockchain would be akin to stating in 1995 that the Internet would be used just for email.\n\nBlockchain is much more than cryptocurrency, and the benefits of blockchain will extend well beyond the financial markets. For example, healthcare is ripe for disruption and applications may include:\n\nSmart property for prescription drugs and regulated pharmaceuticals\n\nSmart contracts between payer, provider, and doctor for decreased fraud and reimbursement\n\neBay type bidding for medical services (discrete and anonymized)\n\nHealth databanks (universal medical records, personal genomics)\n\nSimilar to the internet in 1995, we don’t know where blockchain will go. The one thing we do know is it’s not just hype. A quote that captures the sediment surrounding blockchain well is from Bill Gates a technologist, and philanthropist, stating, ""We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don\'t let yourself be lulled into inaction.""\n\nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?', 'When Mozilla co-founder and former CEO Brendan Eich revealed the Brave Web browser back in January, the idea behind the browser was to block intrusive ads that slowed down the performance and the loading speed of a website. It also restricted the loading of other data collecting technologies such as analytics scripts and impression-tracking pixels. It would allow native, trackerless ads from publishers themselves, as well as non-intrusive safe optimised ads from Brave\'s own ad network.\n\nLast week, Eich detailed the company\'s plan for a user-publisher-browser revenue sharing model for the Brave Ad Network, and the Bitcoin-based micro-payments system for users and publishers called the Brave Ledger. The move will see both users and publishers paid in Bitcoin for viewing and serving non-intrusive Brave Ad Network ads, and maintain Bitcoin-based Brave Wallets for payments. The company has released a developer specification of the Brave Ledger system for discussion, seeking to ensure a streamlined model that doesn\'t present complexity to the user, while giving granularity and protecting privacy.\n\nIt\'s all based on two basic states users can choose to be in - ad-replacement mode and ad-free mode. However, users can also specify certain sites that they want to view in ad-free mode, while viewing all remaining websites in ad-replacement mode.\n\nWhile viewing sites in ad-replacement modes, users will be served ads on those sites where the browser detects an available non-intrusive ad slot from the Brave Ad Network. These ads are mapped to \'a fixed set of general interest categories\', based on the user\'s browsing history. "" No other information is disclosed and no unique or persistent identifiers are used,"" Eich insists.\n\nUsers, ad-matching partners, publishers, and browsers are then paid from the total revenue generated from the advertiser. Eich explains, ""Once an ad campaign is reconciled and our advertising partners pay us, the total views from the ad-replacement users are aggregated into a weighted list for publishers. From the total payment, our ad-matching partner takes a share (15 percent), we take our share (15 percent), we reserve the user revenue share of the total payment (15 percent) for ad-replacement users, and the remaining amount is allocated to the publishers (e.g., 55 percent). The payment to each publisher is then calculated using the weighted-ratio method.""\n\nIn the ad-free mode, users can choose to pay sites they are visiting with the money accrued in their Brave Wallet from the ad-replacement mode, or with funds they add to this wallet. The Brave browser will include preferences panel that will allow users to decide how they want to support the top 10 sites they visit. ""You might prefer to pay your top 10 sites equally, or you might prefer to exclude a particular site or two, and so on,"" the company adds.\n\nUsers can also transfer the Bitcoin money out of their wallets, but for that, they will have to verify their identity to comply with regulations. ""If you choose to verify your identity, then you\'ll need to demonstrate control of a phone number and an email address. Even so, there will be no way for Brave Software to correlate your browsing history with payments to your wallet,"" Eich explains.\n\nPublishers will also have to verify their wallets to get paid, and Eich warned the process will be more stringent than the user-facing one, and be proportional to the size of the publisher.\n\n""One of the nice features of the ad-free model is that accounting is entirely transparent - everyone (users and publishers) can examine the BTC blockchain and see the transfers going to and from the Brave Software escrow accounts,"" notes the company in a blog.', 'Fran Strajnar is an entrepreneur, early bitcoin adopter and Blockchain enthusiast.

Durch die Bitcoin-Technik soll das eine schnelle und günstige Alternative zu Diensten wie Transferwise sein.\n\nGeld per Internet zu versenden ist nicht neu – allerdings zuweilen noch umständlich, langsam und teuer. Bitwala baut gerade an einer Alternative, die mit Bitcoins und der Blockchain-Technologie funktioniert. So positioniert sich das Unternehmen als schnelle und günstige Alternative zu Konkurrenten wie dem gehypten Transferwise oder etablierten Playern wie Western Union oder MoneyGram.\n\nSchon in wenigen Monaten soll bei Bitwala die digitale Währung Bitcoin nicht mehr im Mittelpunkt stehen – zumindest für den Nutzer. Das Berliner Startup will auf diesem Weg Kunden ansprechen, die das System Bitcoin gar nicht kennen, erklärt Gründer Jörg von Minckwitz im Gespräch.\n\nMit ihrer Transfer-Idee haben Minckwitz und seine Mitgründer Jan Goslicki und Benjamin Jones gerade den High-Tech Gründerfonds überzeugt. Zusammen mit der Digital Currency Group (DCG) investiert der Wagniskapitalgeber 800.000 Euro. DCG ist ein Investor, der sich auf das Thema Blockchain und Bitcoin spezialisiert hat. Das Geld soll etwa in Marketing fließen, um den Service bekannter zu machen.\n\nGeldtransfer innerhalb von Stunden\n\nSeit einem Jahr arbeitet das Team an dem Produkt, das es ermöglicht, innerhalb von Stunden Geld ins Ausland zu versenden, wirbt das Unternehmen.

Der Fokus liege nach der Seedfinanzierung erst einmal auf Europa, sagt Gründer von Minckwitz. Später könnten dann weitere Länder folgen.

OpenBazaar listing tracking tool BazaarBay.org still lists some of the now-removed offerings.\n\nThe big question is: Are they the real deal?\n\nBrian Hoffman, project lead for OB1, the development startup that oversees work on the OpenBazaar protocol, told CoinDesk that his team is aware of the listings, and that the listings boil down to two sources: legitimate vendors taking a risk in an attempt to sell their wares via OpenBazaar, and trolls simply looking to stir up trouble.\n\nHe continued:\n\n""We continue to plan to create ways for users to better control the [user] experience on the network, but unfortunately the good comes with the bad and there will most likely always be those who choose to participate in ways that disrupt or ruin the experience for others. We will continue to find more ways to mitigate those challenges.""\n\nThe project has long drawn comparisons to the Silk Road, the now-defunct dark market, and OpenBazaar’s potential to serve as a distributed version that has no central point of failure.\n\nWhile the OpenBazaar team has stressed in the past that they are agnostic about the offers made through the open-source protocol, these listings will no doubt continue to fuel that comparison.\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Even without using this part of the offering, Jaramillo argues Ripple helps make its cross-border payments processes ""better and faster"" for all parties involved.\n\nJaramillo told CoinDesk:\n\n""There’s still a correspondent with bank A and bank B, and we use currency held at bank A and bank B. Structurally, that isn’t fundamentally changed, you still have counterparties. The advantage is [transactions] now all happen very quickly and everyone reconciles to single balances on the Ripple Consensus Ledger. They get driven down to near real-time.""\n\nJaramillo said that, in this context, the main benefit Earthport receives from Ripple is the ability to unite correspondent banks and market makers in the same ledger for the purposes of cross-border transactions.\n\n""It works solely on fiat currencies. There’s no bitcoin, there’s no XRP. There’s no digital bridging asset, it’s standard [foreign exchange],"" Jaramillo emphasizes.\n\nEarthport’s correspondent account network is already live in 60 countries and at 40 institutions. By leveraging this existing account structure, the company has since 1997 worked with banks to offer lower-cost FX conversion.\n\nBut the innovation in its latest distributed ledger offering, Jarmillo said, is in the information sharing between the parties this allows.\n\n""Earthport, banks and market makers can be in the ledger system. Today, it’s just the banks and their counterparty,"" he said. ""There is a single transactional record, everyone can reconcile, everyone can see the balances.""\n\nNo cancer cure\n\nTo onboard to the system, each bank receives a Ripple node, and in turn, the bank is able to access Earthport\'s existing global payment services network.\n\nEarthport also onboards market makers to its system, which determine the bid/ask rates for transactions and then facilitate cross-border payments for clients in trades using traditional government currencies.\n\nIn this light, Jaramillo suggested that the hype around blockchain technology more broadly is overblown. For example, he called certain efforts ""dog and pony shows"" that perhaps overstate the importance of new digital assets or suggest that collaboration is needed for the benefits of shared ledgers to be realized.\n\n""[Shared ledgers] are not going to cure cancer or stop global warming, but it is a tool that can make processes more efficient, and we’ve figured out a good way without a whole lot of work required,"" Jaramillo said.\n\nUnlike proof-of-concepts in development, Jaramillo asserts that Earthport’s program is live today, and that as such, it is able to clearly show clients the value of the technology.\n\n""We can show them, this is the entire process flow, there’s how compliance works, here’s how fraud detection occurs. We do compliance and AML,"" he said.\n\nJaramillo said that this ability helps mitigate concerns of clients who may be more familiar with the open bitcoin blockchain, which uses a largely anonymous network of validators.\n\n""It’s no longer a tech that lives in a lab, it’s real-world applications, real-world bank accounts, real-world financial transactions that can be audited and reported on, and it brings it reality so banks and market makers can jump in,"" he said.\n\nNo need for XRP\n\nAs for the role of XRP, the Ripple Consensus Ledger’s publicly traded token, Jaramillo said it isn’t needed for this project because the traditional market makers it works with already have access to the currencies they need to facilitate trades.\n\n""There’s enough individuals who do this now. There’s not a lack of liquidity,"" he continued.\n\nStudies conducted by Ripple still suggest users of its Ripple Consensus Ledger can save upwards of 40% on trades by using XRP, a figure slightly higher than the savings achieved by those who do not use XRP.\n\nJaramillo said that while he sees the value in potentially encouraging market makers to use a ""common asset"" between parties, regulators have perhaps not given sufficient guidance for financial services firms like Earthport to leverage these offerings.\n\n""I understand how a digital currency could be used, and I think there’s potential for that in the future, but the chasm that is between us and that reality is no central bank or government or institution in the world has given approval to use a digital currency,"" he said.\n\nHe said that, in this light, both bitcoin and XRP, as well as other alternative digital currencies currently fall into a gray area, and that even without these tools, Earthport’s solution enables the same efficiencies but in US dollars or British pounds.\n\nJaramillo said:\n\n""Earthport is in the business of providing banking solutions to banks. We brought Ripple in to make banking better.""\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.\n\nImage via Earthport\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Vice President of Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank by assets and the third largest bank in Europe (2014 figures) has opined that the advent and spread of blockchain technology will see banks disappear by 2026.\n\nSpeaking at Metro Expo 2016, an industry conference, Sberbank’s vice president Andrey Sharov shared his thoughts about the future of the banking industry.\n\nWith quotes reported by Russian news agency , Sharov predicts that the rise of blockchain technology will lead to the demise of the current banking industry as the way we know it to be.\n\nThe Vice President of Russia’s largest bank stated:\n\nIn 10 years, I fear that banks will not be around and I will have nowhere to go to work. Now, there are peer-to-peer lending platforms and those developing payment systems, based on blockchain technology.\n\nIncredibly, the banking executive then went on to state that the Bank of England had established a banking consortium of 50 banks to work on blockchain solutions for the financial industry. As readers will be well-aware, the only banking consortium of such numbers that sees blockchain-based research and proof-of-concept solutions, is that led by New York-based blockchain startup, R3.\n\nSharov stated:\n\nThe Bank of England made a consortium of 50 English banks – those that are completely rebuilt on a model based on blockchain technology. I won’t have any place to work at.\n\nThe opinion echoes that of Antony Jenkins, former group CEO of Britain’s biggest bank, Barclays. In a speech last year, Jenkins predicts a future wherein financial technology, led by innovations such as blockchain, will severely disrupt the current banking system. The former banking executive predicts that those employed in banking institutions will be reduced by at least 20% in the coming ten years, if not up to as much as 50%.\n\nSberbank’s Blockchain Interest\n\nAs Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank has notably shown interest in joining R3’s global banking consortium that consists of 42 leading banks from around the world. In December 2015, quotes attributed to Leve Khasis, Sberbank’s First Deputy Chairman of the Management Board are as follows:\n\nR3 [was created] in order to develop protocols, standards and technology. As soon as [these] are implemented, we believe we [Sberbank] will be among the first to take part in it.\n\nKhasis revealed that Sberbank was actively looking into documentation related to R3, with a final decision pending at the time.\n\nKhasis also revealed that Sberbank was not looking to endeavor into facilitating Bitcoin, or indeed, developing its own cryptocurrency due to strict Russian regulations. Furthermore, he sought to draw a line differentiating bitcoin from blockchain technology.\n\nCryptocurrencies are irrelevant here, it [blockchain] is a simpler, faster and more reliable accounting method.\n\nRussian Authorities: Blockchain, Yes. Bitcoin, No.\n\nThe interest toward blockchain technology by Russia’s biggest bank is one shared by the Bank of Russia, the country’s central bank.\n\nToward the end of February 2016, the Bank of Russia announced the establishment of a ‘blockchain working group’. The group will study and research innovations such as distributed ledgers & mobile and payment industry breakthroughs, among others.\n\nIn December 2015, Nikolai Nikiforov, the Russian Minister for Communications and Mass Media spoke also spoke encouragingly about blockchain technology, noting that it was necessary to exploit distributed ledger tech “in the best interests of the [Russian] public.”\n\nNotably, there are also efforts among authorities calling for the ‘legalization’ of blockchain technology, in an effort to distinguish it from bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nA recently proposed roadmap by the Internet Development Institute was submitted to Russian President Vladmir Putin in December 2015, calling for the legalization of blockchain technology in 2017.\n\nAccording to those involved in crafting the roadmap, blockchain technology does not relate to Bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain – is not the same thing as Bitcoin. It is a revolutionary technology of distributed databases that could be helpful to banks and organizations that work with securities.\n\nAs things stand, an official proposal by the Russian Finance Ministry is currently going through the State Duma, in an attempt to officially ban Bitcoin in Russia. The proposal also calls for prison terms for those using or mining Bitcoin, deeming it to be a criminal offence. Currently, the Russian Finance Ministry if proposing up to 7 years in prison for using the cryptocurrency.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
04/07/2016,"['Make no mistake, Bitcoin and Blockchain will disrupt financial technology in a big way\n\nShare\n\n\n\nBitcoin and Blockchain technology has surged forward as the potential for the next biggest disrupter in the finance industry. Last year Wall Street showed just how serious it was about using their tech when larger financial institutions like Citi, Nasdaq, Visa and others invested in Chain.com, a Bitcoin Blockchain services provider.\n\nBitcoin started off as a digital currency, it was a convenient way to transfer money without a ‘middleman’. However the tech that forms the foundation of Bitcoin, Blockchain, emerged to be the real disrupter.\n\n“A blockchain is a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. The blocks are added to the blockchain in a linear, chronological order.” – Investopedia.\n\nBlockchain technology could completely alter the paradigm of banking by changing the way we transact and make digital authorisations, offering irrevocable proof of ownership with a traceable history. Or it could fail. But already it has sparked new innovation, particularly for start ups and in financial tech as a new authority standard, acting as a sort of digital notary stamp.\n\nIn South Africa alone we have seen innovative development with Blockchain technology; Everledger uses the tech as a permanent ledger for diamond certification, BitPesa is a universal payment and trading platform for Africa, BitX enables people to buy and sell Bitcoin with Rand, and Custos Media Technologies is a startup that is using the technology to crack down on media piracy.\n\nBlockchain as a disrupter for banks\n\nThere still does not seem to be a general consensus as to how the future of Blockchain is going to play out. Start up and fin tech companies cannot seem to agree on which direction it should go.\n\nThe technology is still in its infancy, which means its future is flexible. The code underpinning Blockchain can be used for a multitude of applications, including authenticating transactions, share trading, auditing, digital authentication of other mediums such as eBooks, research papers, and even music.\n\nPerhaps most interestingly is how Nasdaq is using a Blockchain network in a pilot to automate the process of managing and trading shares of private companies, an often expensive and labour intensive operation. Blockchain allows the transaction to take place securely, records it on a public ledger, and continuously syncs so that every ledger is updated with all the details of the transaction.\n\nMost likely the initial phase of Blockchain will be to make existing processes more efficient, secure, transparent, and cheaper. Once it has made its mark and built trust in the industry and in users, the next phase will be for projects we haven’t even thought of yet!\n\nThe challenges financial institutions might face\n\nAs with any new technology there are challenges; the average consumer doesn’t trust Bitcoin as they do the Rand. Convincing them to use it on a large scale would require an industry-wide adoption – which means the banks will need to work together, and it may need to be government-backed, to ensure this digital currency a future.\n\nNo matter the challenges of ensuring its adoption, the potential of the digital ledger technology that underpins Blockchain is revolutionary and is sure to disrupt the financial sector irrevocably.

R3 believes more than blockchain is needed to solve bank problems\n\nEarly on in the post, Brown asserts that “blockchain” has become a term that is disassociated from its technological meaning.\n\nIn his description of Corda, Brown labels the technology a ""distributed ledger platform"", a term that has long been associated with its technology (and that of Ripple), but that has perhaps been more strongly associated with the latter company.\n\nStill, Brown looks to distance R3 from this terminology, and emphasize his conclusion that “blockchain” solutions aren’t going to broadly solve financial industry issues:\n\n""Corda is a distributed ledger platform designed from the ground up to record, manage and synchronize financial agreements between regulated financial institutions. It is heavily inspired by and captures the benefits of blockchain systems, without the design choices that make blockchains inappropriate for many banking scenarios.""\n\nBrown’s reasoning for the argument is that he feels this line of thinking is akin to applying technology to ""arbitrary problems"".\n\n""Every successful project I’ve worked on started with the requirements, not some cool piece of technology, and I was determined to bring that discipline into our work at R3,"" he writes.\n\nBrown goes on to state that he believes the reason blockchain is important in the equation of this larger problem is ""extremely subtle"", and one that is recognized in the architecture of the Corda platform.\n\nThe post also included a harsh critique of platforms that are not questioning why blockchains are needed to solve financial business problems, stating:\n\n""If you don’t have bitcoin’s business problem then be very wary of those trying to sell you something that looks like a bitcoin solution.""\n\n2. Corda uses blockchain, but is not a blockchain\n\nThough details about Corda’s architecture were kept broad, Brown indicated that it uses blockchain as part of a broader package.\n\nHe describes Corda as tailor-made for financial agreements.\n\n""Our starting point is individual agreements between firms (‘state objects’, governed by ‘contract code’ and associated ‘legal prose’),"" he writes.\n\nIn particular, he said that Corda will use blockchain technology in an effort to show that “two valid, but conflicting, transactions” cannot be present in the system.\n\nBrown writes:\n\n""We also recognize that different scenarios require different tradeoffs. So Corda’s design allows for a range of ‘uniqueness service’ implementations, one of which is a ‘traditional blockchain’.""\n\nImplicit in the statement is that there will be other options that may solve this problem, however, and that blockchain would be just one solution among a larger tool-set.\n\n3. R3 has new definition for blockchain\n\nBrown also spent a significant portion of the post questioning the basic properties of blockchains, ultimately concluding that blockchain platforms like Ethereum and bitcoin offer five kinds of services.\n\nThis observation, Brown asserts, enabled R3 to take an analytical approach to thinking about how to tweak these basic properties for the needs of financial institutions.\n\n""The right approach is to treat them as a menu from which to select and customise… different combinations, in different flavours, for different business problems,"" he wrote.\n\nThe five properties are consensus, validity, uniqueness, immutability and authentication. For each, Brown provided a basic definition, later elaborating on the specific ways that Corda is treating each in its design.\n\nIn his definitions, Brown challenged the idea that consensus systems need to be open to worldwide participation, as in bitcoin, arguing that the network works this way because the business problem it tried to solve could be articulated as ‘How do I create a system where nobody can stop me spending my own money?’\n\nFurther, he challenged basic assumptions about how immutability in distributed ledger systems should be defined, while providing high-level overviews of each property.\n\n4. The financial industry’s problem is shared facts\n\nIf Brown spoke at length about how the financial industry is not looking to solve the same problems as bitcoin, he also defined what he believes to be the underlying problem that R3, and by extension, the wider industry, should be trying to attack.\n\nThe emphasis, according to Brown, should be on achieving consensus about the state of deals between individual financial firms. To achieve this, he argues Corda needed to create a digital link between “human-language prose documents” and smart contract code.\n\nBrown writes:\n\n""The financial industry is pretty much defined by the agreements that exist between its firms and these firms share a common problem: the agreement is typically recorded by both parties, in different systems and very large amounts of cost are caused by the need to fix things when these different systems end up believing different things.""\n\nIn this way, Brown defined Corda as an attempt to use a network to ensure that all parties in a transaction “see the same thing” and know that others who need to know this truth can recognize it.\n\nHe went on to write that it is also important for those involved in such deals to specify upfront how agreements are made and how disputes can be resolved, adding:\n\n""We take into the account the reality of managing financial agreements; we need more than just a consensus system. We need to make it easy to write business logic and integrate with existing code; we need to focus on interoperability. And we need to support the choreography between firms as they build up their agreements.""\n\n5. Corda’s big-picture details have emerged\n\nThough there was no white paper or code released on Corda, Brown did provide a high-level overview of how the distributed ledger system will be built based on the properties of blockchain systems he detailed earlier in the post.\n\nFor example, he said Corda would seek to achieve consensus only between parties to deals, not all participants – a design element he categorized as different than public blockchains.\n\n""This does not mean that a third party down the road also needs to see it,"" he wrote.\n\nAs for validity, Corda, he said, lets users write ""validation logic"" in ""time-tested, industry-standard tools"".\n\n""We define who needs to be in agreement on a transaction’s validity on a contract-by-contract basis,"" he continued.\n\nNotably, he said that Corda’s design has the most in common with existing blockchain platforms on elements such as immutability and authentication.\n\n""Our data structures are immutable and our building block is the exchange of digitally-signed transactions,"" he notes.\n\nThough, he continued to stress that it differs through attempts to select a set of validators confirming deals on the network, and that not all validators would take part in this process.\n\nThe design is perhaps not surprising given that R3 has long argued publicly that bitcoin’s globally distributed network of transaction validators, while working for bitcoin and its goals, is ill-suited to the needs of financial incumbents.\n\n6. Corda has no native cryptocurrency\n\nConsistent with its past descriptions as a ""fabric"", Brown indicated that Corda does not use its own digital asset or cryptocurrency.\n\nOf note is the modifier ""native"", which suggests that Corda may support the use of other digital assets or cryptocurrencies.\n\nBrown wrote that Corda would support a “variety of consensus mechanisms"" a further hint that some digital tokens may present or allowed to be used in its ledger system.\n\n7. R3 has bitcoin on the mind\n\nPerhaps the most interesting takeaway from the piece given R3’s market positioning was Brown’s clear deference to bitcoin’s architecture, which he termed a “marvel”.\n\n""Its interlocking components are one of those rare examples of something so elegant that they seem obvious in hindsight, yet which required a rare genius to create,"" he wrote.\n\nBrown even characterized bitcoin as a solution to a “business problem”, albeit one he suggested isn’t one shared by major financial institutions or that they would perhaps even articulate as a business problem.\n\nIn this light, Brown discussed bitcoin’s use of a blockchain as a product of its goals, a similar logic that he used to speak out about why this type of architecture might not be needed to solve issues major financial institutions are experiencing.\n\nNotably, former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn is also leading the effort on Corda, serving as its lead platform engineer.\n\n8. Regulators are included in the Corda ledger\n\nBrown indicated that Corda is also being designed to accommodate global regulators who may want insight into the transactions occurring within distributed ledger frameworks.\n\n“Corda’s design directly enables regulatory and supervisory observer nodes,” Brown indicated early on in the text.\n\nLater, he returns to this idea, noting that financial institutions using Corda will be able to know that their counterparties and regulators have received any information they can view.\n\n9. Corda doesn’t compete with other blockchains\n\nDespite spending a length of time describing how Corda is similar and dissimilar from other systems, Brown sought to frame it as unique.\n\nThe positioning found Brown offering praise for the innovation ongoing in the distributed ledger and blockchain space as a whole, even if he expressed a disdain for firms that were perhaps approaching the industry opportunistically.\n\nBrown said that he as been “deeply impressed” by engineering solutions from other providers, and that R3 will continue to pursue projects that showcase the benefits or shortcomings of these systems in order to provide market information.\n\n“Corda does not seek to compete with or overlap with what other firms are doing: indeed, we are building it because no other platform out there seeks to solve the problems we’re addressing,” he wrote.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Different solutions for different problems is our mantra.""\n\nLightbulb image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Inflation has always been the bane of many businesses and individuals alike.\n\nOne thing is clear: something needs to be done.\n\nIf cryptocurrency, perhaps Bitcoin, was globally accepted as the world’s reserve currency, how well could it manage inflation and provide transparency compared to the U.S. dollar, arguably the world’s primary reserve currency?\n\nThe world of fiat currency seems straightforward enough: Delegate monetary policy to those elected officials most capable of keeping a standardized and stable medium of exchange going.\n\nIn practice, however, things get complicated, and often the policies and the mechanisms to carry out the policies are convoluted and not as transparent as they could be.\n\nFor example, the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) attempts to manage inflation by using open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements, but this monetary system has not been able to reduce long-term inflation.\n\nMuch of this instability in the money supply is due largely to the practice of fractional-reserve banking/lending by commercial banks and lenders and the Fed's imprecise, volatile way of increasing and decreasing the money supply by using bond transactions, discount rates and reserve requirements, which ultimately swings the economy and the money supply exponentially upwards or downwards.\n\nWith the current monetary system, regardless of how well the Fed tries to plan bond transactions, discount rates and reserve requirements to regulate the money supply, the practice of fractional-reserve banking/lending exponentially compounds the effects produced in response to even the slightest changes made to the money supply using the Fed's three primary monetary tools.\n\nCurrently the Fed’s policy on fractional-reserves requires banks and lenders only to keep meager reserves ranging from 0 to 10 percent, which allows banks to create upwards of 90 percent of their money out of thin air.\n\nThink back to the movie “Dumb and Dumber” with the suitcase once flush full of cash that Lloyd and Harry plan on returning to its owner – but they later ended up spending most of the money – leaving behind a pile of napkin IOUs instead.\n\nOur current situation is similar to this, but worse; the banks/lenders create upwards of 90 percent of their money by printing digital bank IOUs without there being any cash, “special” Treasury Department/Federal Reserve IOUs, to back up all of the commercial banks’/lenders’ funds to begin with.\n\nAlso, the fact that banks can charge interest on monies created through this process and often require people to pledge real, tangible assets as collateral for these bank IOUs is another issue altogether. But for the purposes of this discussion, the volatility created through managing money in this way seems to ultimately result in rising long-term inflation.\n\nIn addition, considering the dollar is the primary world-reserve currency, this status creates a unique situation that allows the United States to print excess reserves beyond its domestic needs to help supply the international demand. The excess reserves created in this process can, in turn, potentially distort the very indexes used by the Fed to help manage the money supply, thereby creating a fairly unstable system for managing inflation in the long run.\n\nPerhaps it is time to transition to an alternative medium of exchange that is more transparent and effectively manages short- and long-term inflation.\n\nCryptocurrency may be a solution to regain the value of our savings/earnings on a global scale.\n\nIf Bitcoin were accepted as the world’s reserve currency, this could potentially create an environment that could curb inflation and introduce a moderate amount of favorable deflation until all 21 million bitcoin are eventually minted.\n\nIn fact, a small amount of deflation can actually be a good thing – as suggested by the Friedman rule – and bitcoin would be deflationary until the fixed number of coins are finally minted over the course of time.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is gradually minted at decreasing fixed rates determined every four years, it creates a deflationary effect, despite there actually being an increase in the money supply during this time which most traditional economists would recognize as a condition of inflation.\n\nBut it is this fixed money supply that has the potential to move society forward as quickly as the original token system did that moved us out of the barter economy to something more efficient.\n\nAfter all the bitcoins are created, the only way for the deflationary effect to continue is if bitcoins are lost or destroyed, but the amount of bitcoins removed in this way would likely be minimal.\n\nAgain, with our Bitcoin example, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency approaches the currency distribution and management problem by codifying the rules in a mandatory consensus manner; the rules cannot be changed unless the majority of people decide to voluntarily run the new version of the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nPut simply, the people who secure the Bitcoin network, the “miners,” and use bitcoin to exchange goods and services, can each decide which version of the Bitcoin program they want to run. If people decide they don’t agree with the latest changes made to the Bitcoin protocol, they can run the version of the protocol that has the features they agree with, and the world will continue to do business as usual.\n\nIn a sense, it’s a form of direct democracy: Votes are cast through the sheer action of choosing which version of the Bitcoin program to run.\n\nIn Bitcoin and other open-source cryptocurrencies, zero will never equal one; the software code can be audited at any time, creating an unrivaled level of transparency on the mechanisms of monetary policy.\n\nCryptocurrencies that have a finite money supply have the potential to become a safe haven that staves off long-term inflation for good, offering a new alternative to how people actually do savings and business."", 'A new addition to Bitcoin Core called Opt-In Replace-by-Fee allows transactions to be flagged as replaceable, and actually replaced, until the transaction gets confirmed in the next block.\n\nOpt-In RBF is a change to the memory pool and network relay code and gives wallets the option to add a signal to transactions that gives permission for full nodes to update the particular transaction. Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto introduced transaction replacement in his initial release of the Bitcoin Software, but removed it due to denial of service problems, which opt-in RBF solves by adding a higher fee for transaction replacement.\n\nIt is a slight variation of Replace-by-Fee, another feature included in Bitcoin Core. A full analysis of RBF, written by Aaron Van Wirdum can be found here.\n\nPeter Todd, a Bitcoin Core developer who worked on the opt-in RBF project, publicly expressed concern in a blog post that opt-in RBF wallets are not yet ready to implement detection software for opt-in RBF transactions. He wrote that wallets without this software implemented leave users at a greater risk of being cheated by double-spenders, especially for zero-confirmation transaction (zero-confs). This can lead people to believe that the community should wait to integrate opt-in RBF.\n\nTodd also admits that this is only a valid concern if merchants and consumer wallets were able to warn users of potential double-spend attempts before the integration of opt-in RBF. If wallets are currently unable to properly detect and warn their users, scammers would have no need to use opt-in RBF, as they would have no problem using the existing system.\n\nTodd actually tested the current level of security of popular user wallets against double-spends attacks and posted his findings in a list, as seen below.\n\nWallets not only failed to warn users that a double-spend might happen, the majority even failed to warn their users that a double-spend has happened. Half the wallets tested could be double-spent by an attacker with nearly zero technical sophistication with 100 percent probability of success. The other half could be double-spent with about 25 percent success rates, again by an attacker with nearly zero technical sophistication.\n\nThis means that opt-in RBF will not raise users’ vulnerability to double-spends, as people are already vulnerable with most wallet service providers in the current system until the transaction has been confirmed in the blockchain.\n\nOn the other hand, executives of merchant services platforms such as Stephen Pair from BitPay and Jamie Robinson from AcceptBT have been quick to integrate RBF detection software as part as their strategy to mitigate zero-conf risk.\n\nStephen Pair wrote in a blog post that Bitpay was “thrilled when we saw that Opt-In RBF was merged.” He explained that “both the ‘first seen’ and ‘RBF’ behaviors are useful and valuable features of the mesh network. The ‘first seen’ behavior is not being dropped and existing wallets and infrastructure that make use of the ‘first seen’ behavior will not be affected (except for minor changes needed to detect RBF transactions). This new functionality makes Bitcoin itself more valuable.”\n\nRobinson told Bitcoin Magazine that he simply changed the user interface of AcceptBT to account for the possibility of opt-in RBF. Now, if a transaction has a possible double spend a message displays to notify the merchant that this transaction is not eligible for instant approval, and a pending transaction shows up in their merchant terminal.\n\nPhoto Groman123 / Flickr(CC)', 'A superb creation of the genuine casino game gurus with two-decade gambling experience, FortuneJack Casino is a multi-purpose portal with over 500 superb casino and slot games for the true highrollers and crypto gaming enthusiasts eager for everyday gambling challenges and discoveries.

Thanks to a variety of trading markets, users can trade ETH against PLN, Bitcoin, EUR, and US Dollar. All in all, this seems to be very positive news for Ethereum, as the Ether token becomes more widely available.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Price Technical Analysis 04/07/2016 – 100 MA As Resistance\n\nBitBay Offers Ethereum Trading In Poland\n\nEven though it is rather easy and somewhat convenient to trade Ethereum across the major exchanges already, it is always good to see more localized platforms expand their business. In the case of BitBay, a Polish digital currency exchange, the addition of Ethereum will hopefully help put them on the map in their country, as well as other regions around the world.\n\nAs of a few days ago, Ethereum enthusiasts can trade Ether against various fiat and digital currencies. BitBay offers Ethereum trading markets for Bitcoin, EUR, PLN, and USD, which should attract traders from all over the world. The company is also the very first exchange platform in the Poland region to offer Ethereum trading to its users as well.\n\nIt comes as no surprise to see various digital currency exchanges around the world taking a closer look at Ethereum, as the Ether token has attracted a lot of attention in recent months. Moreover, the token’s value has increased spectacularly, and traders from all over the world are looking to exchange between fiat currency and Ethereum.\n\nKeeping in mind how Ethereum is the second largest digital currency in the world – based on their market cap – it is only normal to see BitBay expand their trading markets and offer ETH support. As users can use three main fiat currencies, as well as Bitcoin, to buy Ethereum, it remains to be seen how this decision will affect the platform’s trading volume.\n\nIt is interesting to note how some of the lesser-known digital currency regions are among the first to add Ethereum to their local exchange offerings. After Korbit in Korea, and Coincheck in Japan, BitBay is the first Polish exchange to offer trading support for Ethereum. Bitfinex, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin exchanges, eventually gave in to adding Ethereum as well, due to overwhelming customer demand.\n\nDespite all of the excitement surrounding Ethereum and its ecosystem, it remains to be seen whether or not this positive trend can continue. Bitcoin has been around for seven years and became the undisputed market leader in the world of digital currencies. Ethereum has a lot to live up to, and it is not the first time an alternative digital currency gains a lot of steam before trailing off later on.\n\nSource; Press Release Via Email\n\nHeader image courtesy of BitBay', ""The cryptocurrency is a powerful tool for early adopters and middle-class entrepreneurs, but it may not provide the opportunities in the developing world that its advocates claim.\n\nSomething strange is happening to Bitcoin. Once viewed as a way to do business in the darkest corners of the web, the digital currency has rather suddenly become a favorite talking point among humanitarians and international development enthusiasts. Bitcoin isn’t just for illicit transactions or Internet hobbyists anymore, but for helping the poor, the downtrodden, and the unbanked. Perhaps Bitcoin can save them! Perhaps Bitcoin can save the world! Regardless of whether this attitude is realistic—and more on that in a minute—the people focused on demonstrating the social benefits of Bitcoin are challenging existing narratives about the cryptocurrency. While early commentary focused on how Bitcoin might be used to buy drugs online, or for sending money without a paper trail; the social-good argument suggests that these uses were simply the first use-cases in which Bitcoin’s utility became apparent. But there are billions of other potential use. There are, for example, people who face significant obstacles in operating within the formal banking system—and these folks look very different from the shadowy hackers that tend to be seen as the prototypical Bitcoin user. They could be low-wage migrant workers sending money back home to their families, for example, or activists receiving money from abroad during tumultuous times.\n\nBitcoin do-gooders also propose the idea of using a blockchain to register and record property titles in countries with tenuous land-rights protections. Instead of using paper-based processes, the blockchain would enable the government to register digital titles that cannot be duplicated or easily changed. Which would mean greater accountability for official records. Think about it this way: Most of the value in developing world communities is locked “dead capital,” or property that cannot be leveraged as collateral for loans or long-term contracts, because ownership of the property is not easily verifiable with a title or deed. In other words, even if someone owns property, that person may not be able to prove ownership sufficiently enough to gain access to money for future long-term investments. That’s according to the development economist Hernando de Soto, who proposes fixing this problem by registering digital versions of property titles into a distributed blockchain like Bitcoin. By being entered into the blockchain, there would be an immutable record of title that could not be easily tampered with or destroyed. People often don’t take the time to understand the problems they’re trying to solve, because they believe they already know the solution. At first glance, this seems like a great idea. But using the blockchain to “solve” land-title problems rests on a shallow, incomplete understanding of the challenge at hand. The complexities of how land titles are managed in developing countries is the result of long-standing conflicts between grassroots communities, their governments, and large multinational corporations. By assuming the problem is mainly about bureaucratic inefficiencies and paper-based processes, Bitcoin enthusiasts ignore the hardest part of the situation: long-standing conflicts over rights and power. Sadly, the focus on documentation via blockchain overlooks the key insights we can learn from de Soto’s work: that land rights struggles are a high-touch, long-term issue.\n\nYet the allure of blockchain as silver bullet is powerful. The writer Courtney Martin aptly describes the tendency to embrace such narratives as the “reductive seduction of other people’s problems,” whereby the bright-eyed American idealist feels capable of solving intricate problems with one-dimensional solutions. As difficult as it is can be for Americans to grasp the full complexity of systemic inequality in their own backyards, Martin argues, it’s much more challenging for Americans to understand the full complexity of problems in places far removed from their daily lives. The idea that blockchain could be a transformative tool for social change underscores this same problem: People often don’t take the time to understand the problems they’re trying to solve, because they believe they already know the solution. Related Story Facebook and the New Colonialism Blockchain enthusiasts like to give the example of a poor farmer or a low-wage migrant worker receiving a low-cost money transfer from a loved one far away. And the cost of money transfer is a real issue. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most expensive region in the world to send money to, with average fees in the range of 9 percent to 10 percent, according to the World Bank. But Bitcoin wouldn’t necessarily make transactions cheaper. The price of transacting over Bitcoin depends on how much demand there is to use the network at a given time. While the number of transactions over Bitcoin has been steadily rising over the last few years, the processing capacity of the network (that is, the volume of transactions that can be processed per second) has remained static. What that means: If transaction volumes continue to grow without a commensurate increase in processing capacity, then transaction fees are likely to climb well above the cost of credit cards or bank transfers. On top of that, wait times for those transactions to be fully processed have become increasingly erratic, causing a record number of complaints from customers trying to pay with Bitcoin.\n\nPart of this bottleneck comes from built-in limits on the number of transactions that can be processed at a given time. The issue of how to increase the processing capacity of the network, while also maintaining critical aspects of its decentralized character, has been a heated topic of debate for well over a year now. And, so far, there hasn't been a clear way forward. These early growing-pains underscore some of the tough engineering decisions that need to be resolved before Bitcoin can be considered a reliable product for the world’s poor. When we understand Bitcoin in terms of one hypothetical story—we cannot grasp the real potential for this technology in places like Kenya. At the same time, companies like Sendwave are also competing with Bitcoin by significantly lowering the price of international money transfers. And while emerging, low-cost remittance services like Sendwave lack Bitcoin’s infrastructure, they’re catching on with developing-world users, who care more about predictability and utility than about Bitcoin’s decentralized structure. Even in the developing world, Bitcoin transfers often aren’t used the way many enthusiasts might suggest. Rather than migrant workers sending money back home, for example, people often send money to themselves. That’s according to Elizabeth Rossiello, the founder of a bitcoin exchange based in Nairobi called BitPesa. Rossiello says much of the international money transfers conducted on the company’s platform were “self transfers” from an individual’s foreign bank account to a Kenyan one, or vice versa. These types of international money transfers are conducted by folks like John Kidenda, a recent graduate from Harvard University who returned home to Nairobi last year for work. “Every month I move a portion of my paycheck from my Kenyan bank to a U.S. account in order to pay back my school loans.” Kidenda said. “Using a service like BitPesa helps me save money on bank transfer-fees and high foreign-exchange rates.”\n\nOther young, tech-savvy Kenyans use the site to gain entry to global trading markets that they otherwise wouldn’t be able to access as lone-wolf traders in a place like Kenya—where sites like E-Trade are not accessible. Clearly, Kidenda and his peers are a far cry from the poor, rural farmer so often celebrated in the story of Bitcoin and low-value remittances. The bottom line is this: When people understand Bitcoin in terms of one hypothetical story—a poor farmer they neither know nor understand—they cannot grasp the real potential for this technology in places like Kenya. Incidentally, most of BitPesa’s traffic doesn’t come from individual accounts at all, but from small- and medium-size businesses that have identified the platform as a more cost-effective means of carrying out e-commerce and trade abroad. “In essence, BitPesa is a company solving the problem of FX [foreign exchange] in Africa,” Rossiello told me. “It is not a glamorous topic, but FX availability and pricing is at the core of every company doing payments, lending, or financial transactions in more than one country.” For example, it’s very expensive for a Kenyan furniture dealer to purchase a bulk order of silk lamp shades from Dubai, given the high bank transfer fees and currency exchanges at both ends of the deal. BitPesa offers a way to engage in same-day international purchases of this kind for a predictable, flat percentage fee. Rossiello says BitPesa could help foster business models like Andela, which sources high-quality software development in Nigeria for Fortune 500 companies like Microsoft. These use cases don’t warm the heart the way the story of our theoretical farmer does, but they point to a more realistic near-future for Bitcoin in the developing world—as a powerful tool for early adopters, who are likely to be upper-middle-class entrepreneurs, building international businesses through trade and online commerce. “Saying that remittances are the only financial product for the entire continent of Africa that is interesting is a major underestimation of the size of these markets and the huge amounts of international trade in the region and beyond,” Rossiello said.\n\nThis doesn’t mean Bitcoin can’t serve individuals in need. Bitcoin has the potential to push forward the conversation about financial inclusion in really interesting ways, just not in the way it’s currently being discussed. Instead, Bitcoin is first pushing people to rethink the way financial transactions should and can work. For example, BitPesa recently sued the mobile network operator Safaricom after Safaricom shut off access to its mPesa, Kenya’s largest mobile money platform, without the notice required by its service agreement. While Safaricom was instrumental in the launching of mPesa, it’s also the main reason for its limited impact as a platform for broader financial inclusion. Is Bitcoin really the best way to think about establishing a digital commons for financial transactions? In the Kenyan startup scene, Safaricom is known for its cutthroat business practices, which make it difficult for smaller companies to offer a diverse set of services and products on top of the mobile money platform. In the case of BitPesa, Safaricom shut off access to its mPesa gateway without notice. This was significant because most Kenyan businesses offer mPesa acceptance as a mode of payment. Blocking access to mPesa was a public statement by Safaricom that they would not support Bitcoin companies. (Bitcoin is not illegal in Kenya, and recent Central Bank notices for consumers alerting them of investment risk in the digital good stop short of banning the use of it.)"", 'The 3D virtual world Second Life, launched in 2003, was heralded as the ultimate development in virtual reality. It had a cult-like following and had stratospheric growth during the initial years, before stagnating. Could Bitcoin be headed in a similar direction?\n\nTechnology has a short shelf life. Speaking at the Europe Money 2020, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the CEO and co-founder of Klarna offered his view on Bitcoin:\n\n“Does anybody remember something called Second Life? Everybody was buying properties in Second Life, because it was this virtual world and property prices were rising. Has everybody forgotten about that? And two years later, Bitcoin comes along. What is the difference really like? I am just amazed about how short memory is.”\n\nOnce the novelty of living a second life wore off, the media, as well as companies who had invested moved on, letting the community stagnate. Although it still has a loyal community of 1 million users, Second Life attracts nowhere near the same media attention that it used to.\n\nSecond Life in essence was a social network and it was replaced by new social networks (including Facebook) which were more reliable and accessible. Second Life was innovative, but it did not solve any existing real life problem.\n\nBitcoin is different\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, solves the vexing problem of transferring value over the internet, in a quick and cost-efficient manner. It is a disruptive innovation and existing players in the financial services industry are investing heavily in blockchain research.\n\nThe plethora of new businesses that Bitcoin has enabled – crowdfunding, crowdsourcing through micropayments, peer-to-peer lending indicate that there has been a paradigm shift.\n\nWhile it is entirely possible that newer generation altcoins are more successful compared to Bitcoin, the first mover advantage and network effect cement Bitcoin’s position as the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin may have its highs and lows, but it isn’t disappearing anytime soon.', 'Rumour has long been that Homeland Security in the United States has been interested in Bitcoin’s role in the buying and selling of drugs and other illegal goods and services, via the dark web in particular. However, a recent indictment form leaked from the US Department of Justice has solidified these rumours.\n\nDigital currency task force\n\nThe indictment form concerns accused marijuana and cocaine dealer, David Ryan Burchard, and the activities of Matthew Larsen, a Special Agent with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). The section in particular that has concerned many with an interest in hiding their cryptocurrency activities comes under the third section in this document, under the subtitle ‘Facts Establishing Probable Cause’. It says:\n\n“I [Matthew Larsen] am part of a digital currency task force focused on identifying the use of digital currency to launder the proceeds of criminal activity. As part of this task force, I have been involved in several investigations into unlicensed digital currency exchangers and narcotics distributors on the dark web who use digital currency to receive payment for the sale of narcotics. These investigations have brought my attention to numerous individuals who have been cycling through large amounts of Bitcoin.”\n\nThere have been suggestions that this task force actually monitors the Blockchain in real-time for suspicious behaviour. In this case, “specifically, in or around March, 2015, I [Matthew Larsen] began investigating David BURCHARD based, in part, on his sale of millions of dollars of Bitcoins to an unlicensed digital currency exchanger. I was, and continue to be, unable to identify a legitimate source of BURCHARD’s large amount of Bitcoins.” This has led many to conclude that the task force is using a combination of public records and real-time Blockchain monitoring to fulfil their obligations.\n\nCriminal activity\n\nFor those who use Bitcoin for more nefarious reasons, this could come as a blow to the perceived anonymity and safety of the virtual currency. However, for the vast majority of users whose actions are all ‘above-board, they need not worry, as the US is only concerning itself with the narcotics-related Bitcoin transactions, that is, for the moment.\n\nFollowing the forced closure of the exchange, ‘The Silk Road’, that ran on the TOR network, the ‘industry’ has been hit in quick succession by a number of actions that have attempted to curb the internet exchange of drugs. For those who have sought safety for their drug dealings on the ‘dark web’, this will only serve as further proof of the increasing grip states have over their activities.\n\nIn a statement to technology magazine, Motherboard, the Tor Project said of the claims that Carnegie Mellon University had co-operated with the FBI in an attempt to breach the network’s security: “the Tor network is secure and has only rarely been compromised. The Software Engineering Institute (""SEI"") of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) compromised the network in early 2014 by operating relays and tampering with user traffic. That vulnerability, like all other vulnerabilities, was patched as soon as we learned about it. The Tor network remains the best way for users to protect their privacy and security when communicating online.”\n\nFurthermore, before that, in late 2013, it was learned that the FBI had installed malware on websites that were hosting child pornography through the taking over of the servers that were hosting it, further proving the United States’ global internet reach.\n\nCould this spell the end of the narcotics exchange industry’s dealings on the TOR browser, or will it only serve as a token reminder of the great risks associated with being employed in such a highly-prosecuted industry?\n\nThe full indictment form can be read here. I highly recommend reading it.']"

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'The Panama Papers leak reveals global corruption and hypocrisy as the world’s elite have been hiding their wealth to dodge taxes and escape scrutiny. However, the global central banking system is the real culprit.\n\nAnother day, another massive breach of the public’s trust by officials. This time, however, the full size and scope of transgressions is truly massive. The fallout from the Panama Papers, a leak of legal documents and financial records, revealing tax evasion and wealth obfuscation by thousands of the world’s elite, has already prompted Iceland’s prime minister to resign.\n\nThe shockwaves from this scandal will certainly rattle the global financial industry, and could potentially catapult Bitcoin and other blockchain-based financial technology to the forefront of the new global economy.\n\nThe Panama Papers scandal\n\nThe leak brings to light the dealings of Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which over the past 40 years has sold anonymous shell companies (including false directors) to countless foreign customers seeking to hide their wealth and disassociate it from their name.\n\nThe guilty parties implicated by this leak, too numerous to concisely list, include German companies and individuals seeking to evade taxes, a smuggling ring of Vladimir Putin’s closest associates, and offshore sheltering by elites in Iceland and China, two countries with strict capital controls.\n\nIn short, the global elite has been revealed to be guilty of hiding their wealth and avoiding taxes. Now, I should point out that while I personally have no problem with keeping your earnings private, and view paying lower taxes to be a rare blessing, the consistency issue remains a troubling one.\n\nAt best, the leak reveals hypocrisy from our rulers calling on us to pay our fair share while they refuse to do the same. At worst, it exposes a two-tiered global society where the ruling parasitic class lives off of the rest of us.\n\nThe underlying problem in government and central banking\n\nBelieve it or not, though, the corruption, hypocrisy, and inequality showcased by the Panama Papers are not the problem, but the symptom. The real issue at hand is a global financial system that benefits the wealthy elite at the expense of the masses. A legal structure that enforces high rates of taxation, while simultaneously providing loopholes for the rich and savvy to exploit, leaves the poor and middle class paying most of the taxes.\n\nAdditionally, a central banking system allows rulers to devalue the currency of their people in order to pay national debts, while only they have the means to keep their assets protected offshore. And they get away with it. Even in Iceland where bankers actually do go to jail, the rich still exploit loopholes in the system that they created or championed, and only face repercussions after some serious investigative journalism.\n\nBitcoin as the solution\n\nNo one system will ever be perfect. However, at the very least, cryptocurrency is equalizing. The supply is fixed, and can never be inflated on a whim. The currency is not controlled by any one person or group, and as such cannot be confiscated from citizens’ bank accounts by a government desperate to pay off debts. And finally, even though it is pseudonymous, Bitcoin transactions are all public and accessible to anyone anywhere in the world, meaning no illusion of transparency while sheltering massive amounts of wealth in offshore accounts.\n\nWhat this means is that Bitcoin would force everyone to play by the same rules, rich and poor alike; and those rules are not crafted by the ruling elite, nor able to be modified them to suit their whims. Cryptocurrency offers a truly equitable monetary system, one that is far more difficult to bend to the whims of whatever crony bureaucrat is seeking to loot the public on that particular day.\n\nThe Panama Papers revealed the worst suspicions of a wary public about their rulers, super-rich, and celebrities: corruption, hypocrisy, and duplicity. They will not change their ways for more than a mere moment until public scrutiny passes. A decentralized, cryptocurrency-driven global financial system could very well put this sort of scandal into the dustbin of history.', 'Süddeutsche Zeitung, in collaboration with The Consortium For Investigative Journalists, revealed 11.5 million leaked confidential documents from a Panama-based law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The documents reveal a shadowy network of politicians, celebrities and other powerful people concealing their wealth.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is not directly mentioned in the documents, there are connections between the Papers and the digital currency. Here are some of the individuals named in the documents, and their sometimes loose, sometimes major, connections to Bitcoin. I’ll start with the major connection.\n\nMexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s “favorite contractor” was mentioned in the documents, which revealed “a complex offshore network” spread across the world.\n\nAt the beginning of April, Andrés Sepúlveda claimed to rig the Mexican election which brought Nieto to power for $600,000. While doing this, he claims to have rented servers in Russia and the Ukraine with bitcoins. He calls the Nieto campaigns “one of the dirtiest Latin American campaigns in recent memory” and “one of his most complex” rigging operations.\n\nListed in the Papers is Argentine President Mauricio, who met with Richard Branson and spoke with him about Bitcoin, drug control and space flight.\n\nAccording to the president’s Facebook page, the president “was very interested in the talk as Branson, plus entrepreneur in areas related to new technologies, such as space flight and use bitcoin is entrepreneurial in humanitarian issues.”\n\nOn to Russia, where Bitcoin’s have perhaps come most close to being banned. An associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Bank Rossiya reportedly laundered hundreds of millions of dollars, allege the Panama Papers.\n\nRussia has a tenuous relationship to Bitcoin. At first, in 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported Russia’s stance was rather benign: “At this stage we need to watch how the situation develops with these kinds of currencies. These instruments should not be rejected,” the Bank of Russia first deputy chairman, Georgy Luntovsky, said.\n\nYet, in 2016, reports that Russia’s Finance Department has sought to ban bitcoin had dominated Russian headlines about the digital currency. In Article 75 of the bill, there is a passage that reads:\n\nThe monetary unit of the Russian Federation is the ruble. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation is the sole issuer of currency. The introduction and issuance of other currencies in the Russian Federation are prohibited.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin claimed the leak to be a US plot.\n\nUkraine’s pro-Western president, Petro Poroshenko, allegedly at the height of violence in Ukraine in 2014, “scrambled to find a copy of a home utility bill for him to complete the paperwork to create a holding company in the British Virgin Islands.”\n\nThe story about Bitcoin and the Ukraine is much different than Bitcoin and Russia. In fact, CCN visited some of the 16,000 Bitcoin-enabled ATMs in the Ukraine which went live in 2015.\n\nFurther, Bloomberg highlighted that a Ukrainian mining pool had come close to controlling 51% of the overall Bitcoin mining network: “in other words, one organization was on the verge of dominating the emission of Bitcoins.”\n\nSome of quickest fallout from the Panama Papers was the no confidence vote Iceland’s prime minister, Sigmundur Gunnlaugson, would be made to endure. Elected after the nation’s financial collapse, he allegedly failed to declare interest on investments in an offshore company.\n\nIceland is home to many Bitcoin mines due to cool temperatures. Auroracoin was launched, by an independent developer, as the world’s first nation-state based digital currency. It’s not exactly caught on, and it’s no affiliation to Iceland.\n\nChinese president Xi Jinping’s family has connections to offshore companies, according to the documents. The president is known for having cracked down on corruption in the country. Jinping claimed technology to be an important part of his platform to grow China’s economy. China accounts for about 80% of Bitcoin transactions in the world.\n\nIn more fallout from the Papers, Prime Minister David Cameron admitted to personal profits from an offshore trust.\n\nThe British prime minister commanded headlines after declaring a “war on encryption”, more or less. “I think we cannot allow modern forms of communication to be exempt from the ability, in extremis, with a warrant signed by the home secretary, to be exempt from being listened to,” Cameron said. “That is my very clear view and if I am prime minister after the next election I will make sure we legislate accordingly.”\n\nHe added: “I have a very simple approach to this issue which is that ever since we faced these terrorist threats it has always been possible, in extremis, with the signature of a warrant from the home secretary, to intercept your communications, my communications, or anyone else, if there is a threat of terrorism. That is applied whether you are sending a letter, whether you are making a phone call, whether you are using a mobile phone, or whether you are using the internet.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology\'s use case as an asset class.\n\nBitcoin spent most of the seven days ending 8th April fluctuating between $415 and $425 amid modest trading volume.\n\nThese developments largely mirrored the previous week, with the exception of the fact bitcoin experienced weaker trading volume compared to the last several weeks.\n\nSome market experts sought to explain bitcoin’s relative price stability by asserting that low volatility has sapped the interest of many traders. George Samman, a blockchain advisor and consultant, told CoinDesk that bitcoin\'s volatility has fallen to its lowest since 2012, and that as a result, ""volume has dried up"" and lies far below both its 52-day and 52-week moving average.\n\n""I still believe it’s the calm before the storm,"" he stated, adding that this is ""pretty much a no trade zone.""\n\nZane Tackett, director of community and product development at Bitfinex, struck a similar tone by telling CoinDesk that ""there\'s a lot of watching and waiting"", and that as a result, ""things are pretty calm.""\n\nHe spoke to the major challenges facing bitcoin, stating that people are mostly ""wondering how scaling will pan out"" and ""whether or not the SegWit soft-fork is deployed smoothly and on time"".\n\nOthers pointed to seasonal factors. For example, many traders have been on holiday because of Easter in the West and the Qing Ming holiday in China, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, told CoinDesk.\n\nPrice movements\n\nDuring the seven-day period through 8th April at 12:00 UTC, the price bitcoin climbed from $415.42 to $421.07, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals.\n\nThis represents a modest increase of 1.4%. The digital currency did experience some notable fluctuations during the week, surging from $415.73 at 21:00 UTC on 1st April to $420.25 at 01:00 UTC on 8th April.\n\nBut, bitcoin then traded largely between $417.50 and $420 until 02:00 UTC on 5th April, before fluctuating between $420 and $422.50 for the rest of the week.\n\nThe digital currency stayed within this tight range as market participants traded more than 8m BTC during the seven days through 8th April at 17:00 UTC. This figure was a pretty far shot from the robust transaction volume of 32m BTC that exchanges logged during the prior week.\n\nEther still volatile\n\nWhile bitcoin had a mild week in terms of price movements and trading volume, ether, the native cryptocurrency on the public, Ethereum blockchain experienced sharp fluctuations, falling 14.3% from 0.028 BTC to 0.024 BTC during the seven days through 8th April at 12:00 UTC.\n\nThis sharp decline took place when many are trading alternatives to bitcoin due to their volatility, said Hayes. Amid this renewed interest, ether generated 24-hour trading volume of 19,856 BTC during the start of the week and 19,898 BTC at the end.\n\nChristopher Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, shed some light on ether\'s future price movements by reviewing the technicals.\n\n""Ether broke through triple bottom support that it had developed since March 20th, around .0235 bitcoin/ether,"" he stated, citing Poloniex data. ""If it doesn’t reverse the downward trend it may retrace all the way back to .020, where it experienced high volume on March 18th, which led to a strong price bounce at the time.""\n\nBitcoin\'s rising legitimacy\n\nWhile bitcoin\'s relative price stability has been helping generate visibility for ether, several market experts asserted that this lack of volatility could help bitcoin garner greater legitimacy.\n\n""Up to a year ago, the volatility of bitcoin was a huge topic,"" Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, a digital currency-focused hedge fund, told CoinDesk. He added that, ""If you take a step back and look at bitcoin from a lifecycle standpoint, the currency is experiencing record-setting stability.""\n\nEnneking said:\n\n""If you look back at certain of the criticisms which some have levied against bitcoin as a currency, one was that it was too unstable.""\n\nIf that argument carries water, “bitcoin is coming closer to being considered a legitimate currency,"" he said.\n\nWhile Enneking spoke to how greater stability may be making bitcoin more valid, another expert asserted that its lack of volatility is helping show the digital currency’s fair price.\n\n""Continued price stability shows that bitcoin is priced at fair value despite lower levels of speculative trading,"" Joe Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n""A reduction in price volatility will allow for growth in Bitcoin’s utilitarian use cases to shine.\n\nCharles L.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Image: Shutterstock\n\nIf you spend some time in Bitcoinland, you\'ll notice that a vocal section of the community strongly dislikes central banking. In their view, the digital currency is the solution to central banking\'s many problems, including a lack of transparency, a close relationship with the global power elite, and the central banks\' ability to conjure money from thin air. For these people, using bitcoin is a way to disempower central banks—and empower the individual.\n\nSo what would happen to the world\'s central banks if bitcoin replaced national currencies? Turns out it would look a lot like a return to the gold standard, which was abandoned a long time ago, according to a recent staff working paper from Warren Weber at the Bank of Canada, the country\'s central bank. And most people wouldn\'t necessarily be better off in a bitcoin world. In fact, they could be left more vulnerable to financial crises.\n\nIn the paper, Weber ""imagines a world in which countries are on the Bitcoin standard, a monetary system in which all media of exchange are Bitcoin or are backed by it,"" and compares this imagined future to a real past (1880-1913) when gold performed the same function.\n\nThe predictions? Central banks would generally have a lot less room for some key stabilizing activities: setting nationally independent interest rates, creating money, and targeting inflation. Currency exchange rates would be fixed. Financial crises would still occur, and in the end might actually cause enough of an uproar to prompt a return to government-backed money.\n\nHowever unlikely mass bitcoin adoption may be, according to this Bank of Canada report, it would seriously hurt central banking as we know it\n\n\n\nUnder a bitcoin standard, Weber points out that central banks\' key interest-rate setting power would vanish thanks to the ""virtually costless arbitrage of Bitcoin across countries."" In other words, bitcoin-holders around the world could actually offset the actions of central banks, and affect the national money supply, just by chasing better returns for themselves.\n\nDavid Yermack, a finance professor at New York University, compares this scenario to Europe today, where national central banks have ""ceded control over monetary policy to the [European Central Bank] and the Euro,"" causing particular trouble for Greece, as he told me in an email. ""A central bank loses a lot of its power if it cannot control the money supply.""\n\nSince bitcoins are created by the bitcoin network at a predetermined rate, a central bank under a bitcoin standard would be ""limited in what it can do because it cannot act as the lender of last resort to itself"" by printing unlimited amounts of its own currency, according to Weber.\n\nThat\'s because money backed by bitcoin would have to conform to the supply of bitcoins, which is hard coded to increase at a set rate until a 21-million cap. So under a bitcoin standard, not only would economic crises still happen, but authorities would have fewer tools at their disposal to fight them.\n\nThe news isn\'t all bad for bitcoin. The Bank of Canada paper predicted that economic growth likely wouldn\'t change much if it became the primary world currency, despite its deflationary model. Weber also found that prices would be more predictable, and that dealing with currency exchange would naturally be much less of a headache.\n\nBut not all economists agree that deflation isn\'t a problem. Yermack points out that the gold standard\'s deflation caused social upheaval ""and many people felt this was a real brake on economic growth...The optimal rate of monetary growth should really equal economic growth, not some artificial limit imposed by software.""\n\nSo will bitcoin take over? Not if governments or central banks have anything to do with it. Weber argues that they\'ll ""take actions to prevent it,"" for two reasons. One is to protect the revenues they bring in from ""the ability to almost costlessly create money,"" he writes.\n\nThe second, according to Weber, is to protect their ability to ""implement interest policies to affect their domestic economies. Governments would lose the ability to do either or both of these under the Bitcoin standard,"" he writes—not an acceptable outcome.\n\nHowever unlikely mass bitcoin adoption may be, according to this Bank of Canada report, it would seriously hurt central banking as we know it. But bankers might not have to worry. Eventually, a better technology will probably emerge anyway, replacing bitcoin altogether, Weber argues. Or bitcoin itself may evolve into something completely different.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Now, however, it seems as though its rise in popularity is due to continue in the the United Kingdom after a new report found that a fifth of U.K. employees believe that their organizations will be accepting Bitcoin and similar digital currencies as payment by 2020.\n\nThe study, Beyond Digital, by Infomentum looked at the feedback from 1,000 office workers examining how they believe office technology is set to evolve over the next few years. According to the report, during the past five years digital transformation and technological change have seen companies rethink the way they do business, whether on or offline.\n\nIn 2014, Infomentum produced a report titled Generating Success with Generation C, enabling businesses to understand the expectations of the connected customer and how those expectations were making their way into the workplace. In 2015, a report called Talking Transformation was released, looking at how CEOs could restructure their organizations before the market disrupted them.\n\nThis latest report is aimed at helping businesses look beyond digital transformation as it focuses on what else Generation C ? made up of young, tech savvy consumers ? wants over the next few years, enabling businesses to prepare their organizations for 2020 based on the analysis and views from leading experts.\n\nAccording to the report, 91 percent of employees don’t believe that their employer will remain competitive in 2020 in their current form, with 50 percent believing that their employers need to invest in new IT equipment to remain competitive.\n\nIn addition, 14 percent of employees would like to see drone deliveries introduced by 2020 while 16 percent of office workers are hopeful that 3D printed “product downloads” will be possible by 2020. Contactless mobile payment is predicted to become the principal payment method in the next few years.\n\nIt’s interesting to note how much of an impact Bitcoin is having on the digital world as more companies consider its attributes and how it can make a positive difference for countless companies in the years ahead. Considering that 1 in 5 people would like to see digital currencies introduced by 2020 it demonstrates how office workers and the companies they work for believe what the future of digital transformation and technology will look like.\n\n“As this report highlights, the next five years will see dramatic changes in the current buyer journey,” said Vikram Setia, partner and chief commercial officer at Informentum. “As new technology alters the marketing, sales and delivery process, retailers must be open to innovation and willing to completely rethink their approach.\n\n“By 2020, products may be previewed in AR (augmented reality), paid for in Bitcoin, created to order through 3D printing, and delivered by drone to a customer’s door. All while being monitored and managed through the real-time feedback of social media,” Setia said.\n\n“While this array of new technologies may seem daunting for many businesses, retailers must be prepared to think about how such tools are likely to impact their businesses at a long-term strategic level,” he said. “Those that fail to develop the necessary technology roadmap, will have already fallen behind.”', ""Three weeks ago, a debilitating digital virus spread quickly in computer networks at three Southern California hospitals owned by Prime Healthcare Services, encrypting medical and other data so it was impossible to access.\n\nUsing a pop-up window, unidentified hackers demanded about $17,000 in the hard-to-trace cybercurrency called bitcoin for the digital key to unlock the data.\n\nThe company says it defeated the cyberattack without paying a ransom. But it acknowledged some patients were temporarily prevented from receiving radiology treatments, and other operations were disrupted briefly while computer systems were down.\n\nThe attempted extortion by criminal hackers was the latest case of what the FBI says is a fast-growing threat to vulnerable individuals, companies and low-profile critical infrastructure, from hospitals to schools to local police.\n\nThe security breaches — which temporarily disable digital networks but usually don't steal the data — not only have endangered public safety, but revealed a worrying new weakness as public and private institutions struggle to adapt to the digital era.\n\nSo-called ransomware attacks have surged so sharply that the FBI says hacking victims in the United States have paid more than $209 million in ransom payments in the first three months of this year, compared with $25 million in all of 2015. The FBI has not reported any arrests.\n\n“Ransomware is a growing threat to businesses and individuals alike,” Chris Stangl, a section chief in the FBI's cyber division, said in a statement to The Times.\n\nCompanies should train employees not to open digital attachments or to click on unfamiliar weblinks in emails that might contain viruses or other malware, Stangl said. They also should back up critical data and use up-to-date virus detection software.\n\nGovernment officials are particularly concerned that hackers could lock up digital networks that run electrical grids, and oil and natural gas lines, according to Andy Ozment, assistant secretary of cybersecurity and communications at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nRansomware attacks likely are increasing because people are willing to pay, Ozment said. “It's safe to assume if criminals continue to do it, they are making money from it,” he said.\n\nMost of the Internet extortion targets private companies, which rarely advertise paying ransom. Towns must disclose use of taxpayer funds.\n\nIn March 2015, for example, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department in coastal Maine paid about $350 in bitcoin for the key to its encrypted data after a malware attack. After the data was unlocked, Western Union reimbursed the county for the ransom payment, according to a county official who described the transaction.\n\nThat followed similar reported attacks on law enforcement in Tewksbury, Mass.; Midlothian, Ill.; Dickson County, Tenn.; Collinville, Ala.; and Durham, N.H. Some police chiefs refused to pay, saying they had backed up their data or it wasn't crucial.\n\nThe price apparently has risen sharply in recent months.\n\nThis year, the Horry County School District in northeast South Carolina paid a ransom of $10,000 in bitcoin after dozens of their school servers were infected.\n\nThe FBI does not condone payment of ransom, as payment of extortion monies may encourage continued criminal activity ... or be used to facilitate serious crimes. — Chris Stangl, a section chief in the FBI's cyber division\n\nOn Feb. 5, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center paid about $17,000 in bitcoin to regain control of its patients' information.\n\nThe disruption was so severe that the hospital's central medical records system was largely unusable for 10 days, and some patients were transferred to other facilities for treatment, officials said. The 434-bed short-term acute care hospital is owned by CHC of South Korea.\n\nIn March, hackers encrypted data at MedStar Health, which operates 10 hospitals in Maryland and the District of Columbia. The virus caused delays in service and treatment until computers were brought back online. The company said it did not pay a reported $19,000 ransom demand.\n\nAnalysts say hospitals are being targeted because many recently converted to digital records from paper, and their data security isn't yet as strong as banks, insurance companies and government networks that have been hacked in the past.\n\n“The problem is that hospitals aren't very mature when it comes to cybersecurity and dealing with robust, sophisticated online attacks,” Eduardo Cabrera, vice president for cybersecurity strategy at the security company Trend Micro Inc. in Irving, Texas. “A hospital needs health data in order to treat its patients. Hackers know there [are] major consequences if they don't act quickly.”\n\nThe hackers, many from Eastern Europe or Russia, have found ransomware to be so profitable that they set up call centers, said Cabrera, who investigated underground hacking rings as chief information security officer for the U.S. Secret Service.\n\nEnglish-speakers with the hacking group will talk to victims over the phone or online and “help” them convert dollars into bitcoin and settling the ransom, he said.\n\nPrime Healthcare, which operates 42 hospitals in 14 states, said it is still conducting a forensic investigation of the March 18 ransomware attack on Desert Valley Hospital in Victorville, Chino Valley Medical Center in Chino, and Alvarado Hospital Medical Center in San Diego.\n\nSreekant Gotti, the company's chief information officer, said in a written statement that the company, which is based in Ontario, Calif., did not pay the ransom.\n\nComputer “systems were quickly brought back online without compromising patient safety, or patient or employee data” because they had backed up the data, he added.\n\n“These kinds of vulnerabilities are widespread in the health care industry and need to be addressed ahead of time,” Gotti said. “For that reason, Prime Healthcare had various levels of protection and controls built into its systems, including multiple levels of backup.”\n\nAn attack typically starts when a user opens a malicious email attachment that uploads a virus into the computer network. But hackers also have developed so-called drive-by attacks, in which a user inadvertently uploads malware by clicking on a compromised website.\n\nThe first known ransomware cases appeared in Russia about 2005. Hackers encrypted emails, video and photos on individual accounts, and demanded relatively small ransoms — $25 or so — to unfreeze them.\n\nSimilar attacks soon spread across Europe and the United States as cyberthieves began seeking more valuable data — and charging more to free it.\n\nIn January, the FBI warned of a new scheme called CryptoWall 2.0 that locks up hard drives and directs the user to a webpage that shows a clock ticking down the time until the ransom doubles.\n\nA March 31 alert from the Department of Homeland Security said hospitals and healthcare facilities in the United States, New Zealand and Germany had been infected with a destructive form of ransomware called Locky."", 'Are public blockchains really a viable option for guaranteeing settlement finality for financial instruments?\n\nTim Swanson, director of market research at R3, claims public blockchains by design cannot definitively guarantee settlement finality. For this reason, he says they are not presently a reliable option for clearing and settling financial instruments.\n\nSwanson aired his views on tabbforum in response to the view among some crypto enthusiasts and investors who see public blockchains as a settlement mechanism for financial instruments.\n\nSwanson claims they ignore the regulatory, legal and commercial requirements and regulations concerning the need for definitive settlement finality.\n\nThe Need For Finality\n\nThe European Commission’s directive 98/26/EC was motivated by the need to minimize systemic risk by ensuring any payment considered final according to the system rules was, in fact, final, even in insolvency proceedings.\n\nMinus definitive finality, one participant’s insolvency could undermine transactions considered settled and unleash a host of liquidity and credit problems for other participants in the payment system.\n\nBy ensuring definitive settlement, finality creates trust in the system and minimizes risk. Hence, it is one of the most critical concepts in payments, one that applies to all settlement and clearing systems such as bulk SEPA clearing system STEP2 and high-value payment system Target2.\n\nCyrpto proponents think immutability is unique to public blockchains, Swanson noted. But strong, one-way cryptographic hashing gives immutability to any data it is hashed by. If a person changes one part of a transaction, the hash changes and another person knows it has changed.\n\nProof-Of-Work’s Role\n\nProof-of-work that many blockchains use gives a way to vote on the inclusion and ordering of transactions in a block in an environment where one does not know who is voting. If one knows who votes, there is no need for proof-of-work.\n\nHence, proof-of-work-based blockchains like bitcoin offer no way to predict their future security level, or settlement, since it is directly proportional to the token’s future value, which is not knowable.\n\nIf a native token’s market value rises or falls, the amount of work created by miners competing to receive the seigniorage and contract or expend capital outlays also changes in proportion to the token’s marginal value. This leaves open the possibility that Byzantine actors will create block reorganizations with no legal recourse.\n\nThe miners can remove a transaction from the history so that a payment someone thought they made is suddenly unmade.\n\nWith public blockchains, miners have complete discretion on ordering and reordering transactions. While mining pools can’t reverse one-way hashes like a public key, they can make it so that in any transaction, despite its value, can be blocked, reordered or censored.\n\nIf two conflicting transactions can be included in a blockchain, the payment to one party can be mined and replaced at any time in the future by the payment to another party.\n\nCensorship-Resistant Systems\n\nIn Ethereum and bitcoin, mining pools have the complete discretion of organizing and reorganizing blocks. As there is a cost to such rewriting of history, there are also tradeoffs in making censorship-resistant systems like bitcoin.\n\nOne tradeoff is that entire amounts of value can be reorganized or removed with no recourse since public blockchains were designed around securing pseudonymous consensus. This is a key characteristic that cannot be eliminated without destroying the core utility of a public blockchain, which is censorship resistance.\n\nHence, as long as bitcoin miners have complete discretion over the process of transaction validation, a risk of a reorganization exists.\n\nIf you remove censorship resistance but still utilize proof-of-work, a public blockchain no longer exists. Instead, there is a very costly hash-generating gossip network.\n\nSuch a quasi-anarchic system can be useful to some, but it is not a desirable attribute for regulated financial institutions that have invested in removing risks from the settlement process.\n\nDefinitive Settlement Needed\n\nPutting aside the regulatory structures surrounding the settlement of financial instruments, participants today realize that it makes sense to have definitive settlement finality.\n\nConsidering how the mining process works, miners can and have reorganized history. A public blockchain cannot serve as a definitive guarantee of a final settlement.\n\nUncertainty is not desired by markets. Hence, removing systemic risks has been a driver for global settlement platforms.\n\nPublic blockchains can be alluring because of the way they are marketed, but they are not a viable solution for organizations that want to provide certainty. Nor are they reliable for settling and clearing financial instruments.\n\nAlso read: Why banks’ best bet is a public block chain (with bitcoin)\n\nNew Solutions Emerge\n\nSolutions are evolving to address this issue that do not rely on public blockchains for settlement. Private blockchains are designed specifically to give users definitive legal settlement finality. This is needed for regulators and regulated institutions.\n\nFor the past 18 months, banks have examined more than 150 pilots and proof-of-concepts and denied nearly all of them. The banks have done so not because they oppose cryptocurrency, but because public blockchains do not meet their needs.\n\nIf researchers observe the failure risks connected with public blockchains falls within an accepted risk, some institutions will consider conducting more proof-of-concepts.\n\nTradeoffs in designing permissioned ledgers and public blockchains do exist. It is self-defeating to create a network that is censorship resistant from legal infrastructure and at the same time compliant with legal settlement requirements. Nonetheless, both networks will coexist, and their communities will learn from each other.\n\nIf the objective for fintech startups is to develop a new commercial rail for securing different types of financial instruments, then delivering products that meet the needs of market participants is more important than trying to link everything into a pseudonymous network that doesn’t have the characteristics institutional customers need.\n\nAnalyst Questions Some Points\n\nVenzen Khaosan, a market analyst and writer of CCN’s daily bitcoin price analysis report, takes issue with some of Swanson’s points.\n\n1) Swanson states as a fact that a single miner (or mining pool) can remove a transaction from history. This is only true in a very specific case: the attack vector of removing a transaction from history requires that the miner (or pool) commands more than 51% of network hashrate. He’s speaking about a 51% attack. The entire point of a proof-of-work blockchain is that it is immutable – the more decentralized (healthy) the network, the truer that becomes.\n\n2) He states as a fact that one party’s payment can be replaced by another’s at some point in the future. This is incorrect. Transaction malleability only allows tx replacement within a very small time window (less than 10 minutes) but does not allow arbitrary tx replacement once a tx is confirmed. Even so, transaction malleability will be “fixed” by SegWit, along with the introduction of additional fraud proofs.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'BNP Paribas is choosing to begin its public experiments with blockchain tech by pursuing one of its less discussed use cases – crowdfunding.\n\nThe French financial services giant intends to launch a private securities program built using blockchain tech. The effort, a partnership with SmartAngels, a firm that allows entrepreneurs to raise money from private and professional investors, even has ambitious attempts to go live by the second half of 2016.\n\nIn interview, BNP Paribas product manager Johann Palychata said that crowdfunding was selected as one of the company’s first use cases due to its ability to impact the market more immediately than other alternatives.\n\nPalychata told CoinDesk:\n\n""With small volumes, yet quite complex processes, we saw an opportunity to work on blockchain technology for crowdfunding.""\n\nPalychata said that BNP believes blockchain tech could address three big challenges in crowdfunding by creating standardization; making it easier to manage and register crowdfunded shares; and increasing transparency and reliability in the market.\n\n""I would say the first thing [blockchain helps] is standardization of the securities registration, that is very important for crowdfunding,"" he said.\n\nPalychata further noted that the blockchain would add transparency and accountability to the market, features that wouldn’t be reduced as the number of participants using the platform increased with demand.\n\nThe formal announcement follows internal hackathons and explorations by BNP. Palychata described the firm’s approach to blockchain as being in ""project mode"", a phase that finds the firm putting an emphasis on prototyping various blockchain applications.\n\n""We’ve engaged with many different counterparties and what you see here with this announcement is we’re clearly going into crowdfunding,"" he said.\n\nStill in testing\n\nWhile Palychata did not say which specific technologies BNP and SmartAngels are using to build the platform, he said that tokens on the blockchain will be used to represent ownership.\n\n""The main function is registering securities on the blockchain,"" he said, adding that startup operators would then be able to distribute them to their investors.\n\nPalychata said that BNP conducted a test of its technology on an internal blockchain, and that it would perhaps soon announce steps to introduce other partners to this ecosystem.\n\nHe noted that the project will need a functioning order book, investors and startups using the platform for it to be truly tested.\n\nStill, Palychata did not indicate what the timeline for such work would be.\n\n""It’s too early for me to announce other things,"" he added.\n\nSecondary market\n\nWhen asked about the ramifications the project could have at scale, Palychata was quick to focus on the steps ahead for the pilot, preferring not to speculate on its impact.\n\nTo start, he said, the project could be considered a success by simply becoming a platform for securities that aren’t currently listed by major exchanges.\n\n""We see a huge benefit for the market to have such a platform in place,"" he said. ""Obviously, when you have a platform on which you have many issuers and investors, you have the development of a secondary market. But that’s not the first goal we’ll reach.""\n\nAs for whether startups and small businesses will continue to leverage crowdfunding, and whether they’ll look for the efficiencies of a blockchain platform, Palychata was similarly focused on the work ahead.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Blockchain might enable a secondary market. We’ll see.""\n\nBNP image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

04/09/2016,"['CoinTelegraph spoke to employees and freelancers about getting paid in Bitcoin and learnt the pros and cons of this payment method.\n\nHaving a salary paid in cryptocurrency offers a lot of opportunities for an employee - from sweet bonuses to long-term investments and more. However, before considering it as a method of receiving your wage, it won’t hurt to ask for some advice. For example, do you know how to arrange conversion of cryptocurrency to fiat currency? What are the advantages, disadvantages and pitfalls of being paid in cryptocurrency? And finally, what kinds of jobs are paid this way?\n\nNiel De La Rouviere, one of the first people to be paid in Bitcoin, said to Fast Company:\n\n“I discovered bitcoin in early 2011. At first it was something that felt like play money and almost surreal. I didn’t fully understand all the details back then, but a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency was just too crazy and I became intrigued.”\n\nHigh wages, nice bonuses and no paperwork\n\nFirst of all, you can benefit from the exchange rate: If you do not immediately convert your Bitcoin to fiat currency and instead wait for a more beneficial exchange rate, you may get a nice bonus to your wage (in fiat money) depending on your trading abilities and your patience.\n\nSecondly, you don’t need to do any paperwork - this is especially important for freelancers, moonlighters and those who strongly hate bureaucracy. Nobody will ask you about the source of sum equivalent to $10,000 credited to your Bitcoin wallet, and the wallet itself will not show you a message saying that limits were exceeded and now you have to go through verification/authorization procedure, send a pack of notarized documents or visit your bank. However, this is true only until you decide to convert your “coins” to cash.\n\nThirdly, the wages are higher than average on the market. If an employer can only offer this exotic payment method, feel free to ask for more money due to the inconvenience of this payment method. Besides, payment in Bitcoin is often related to jobs which require specific knowledge of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin startups, exchanges, etc.) Such knowledge is sought after, and if you have it, you can be paid more than the average market wage for your profession.\n\nIn addition to this, if you save some bitcoins, it can turn into a long-term investment. Some experts predict that the Bitcoin exchange rate can be as high as $10,000, and so, if you save up a part of your earned Bitcoins, you will substantially increase your capital.\n\nLast but not least - it is exciting and interesting. If you find a job in a crypto-startup, you can learn a lot and develop your skills in a new field that you have never experienced before.\n\nJeremy Allaire, Circle CEO, explains to CNN Money:\n\n""When people start experiencing personal payments the same manner they do with email and text, consumers are going to start saying, \'Why can\'t my company pay me this way?\' It\'s going to be a consumer led phenomenon.""\n\nPossible losses and limitations\n\nHowever, getting paid in cryptocurrency might not be for everyone. One should be prepared for certain risks and limitations.\n\nThe BTC exchange rate is notoriously unpredictable, it can either rise or fall substantially, decreasing your profit, or potentially even turning it into a loss. The prediction that the exchange rate of 1 BTC will be as high as $10,000 has no validation. Just as well, within a few years, 1 BTC could cost $10 on the market. If you prefer Litecoins or Dogecoins, we have bad news for you, employers mainly offer Bitcoin.\n\nLastly, do you have a good command of the English language? If you don’t, it will be very difficult for you to find a good job paid in cryptocurrency - the vast majority of job offers come from foreign companies, the main working language of which is English.\n\nBesides, work for cryptocurrencies is usually related to IT projects. There are much less offers for experts in other fields. So, if you are a programmer, designer, marketer, arbiter, tester, engineer, copywriter/journalist, content manager, or financial analyst, then you have a better chance of getting employed and paid in crypto.\n\n[This article was written in cooperation with Hashflare.]', ""Due to the growing interest in the Bitcoin digital currency, a research consultant for Canada's central bank decided to imagine a world where the monetary system was based on the emerging cryptocurrency; interestingly enough, it would resemble the gold standard and would seriously damage central banking as we know it.\n\n“Suppose that the use of Bitcoin has grown to such an extent that it has replaced existing fiat currencies and has become the predominant medium of exchange or at least the backing for the predominant medium of exchange in a large group of countries,” Warren Weber writes in his 37-page paper on the issue entitled “A Bitcoin Standard: Lessons from the Gold Standard”.\n\n“I will call a monetary system the Bitcoin standard, because such a monetary system will very likely be similar to the gold standard,” the author suggests.\n\n“The two standards are similar in that changes in the supply of the anchor of the monetary system are not under the control of any central bank or monetary authority. Changes in the supply of Bitcoin are set deterministically by the algorithm that governs how many new Bitcoins “miners” receive for verifying Bitcoin transactions and adding them to the blockchain. Changes in the world stock of gold were determined by gold discoveries and the invention of new techniques for extracting gold from gold-bearing ores.”\n\nThe predictions? Central banks would generally have a lot less room for their business: key interest-rate setting power would vanish thanks to the “virtually costless arbitrage of Bitcoin across countries.”\n\nIn other words, bitcoin-holders around the world could actually offset the actions of central banks, and affect the national money supply, just by chasing better returns for themselves.\n\n© Flickr/ Ken Teegardin Ponzi Schemes: From Wall Street to Bitcoin Era\n\nWeber also suggests that since bitcoins are created by the bitcoin network at a predetermined rate, a central bank under a bitcoin standard would be “limited in what it can do because it cannot act as the lender of last resort to itself” by printing unlimited amounts of its own currency.Hence Weber says that governments and central banks will “take actions” to prevent the new currency from taking over for two reasons.\n\nOne is to protect the revenues they bring in from “the ability to almost costlessly create money,” he writes.\n\nThe second is to protect their ability to “implement interest policies to affect their domestic economies. Governments would lose the ability to do either or both of these under the Bitcoin standard,” he writes — not an acceptable outcome.\n\nThe paper therefore concludes that even if the Bitcoin standard were to come into existence, it would not last long, for two reasons:\n\n“The payments world is changing so rapidly that there will be a technological innovation that provides a potential medium of exchange with the same or greater benefits of Bitcoin or with lower costs. Such an innovation could come either from the private sector or from the government.”\n\nAnd second, there would be “pressure to return to a fiat money system so that a more activist monetary policy could be pursued”.\n\nMeanwhile, chairman of the finance department and a professor at New York University Stern School of Business David Yermack has explained Bitcoin’s true value as an investment rather than a standard.\n\nIt likely lies in its enabling technology, called blockchain, rather than its potential as a digital currency. Just as the internet transformed the way we share information, blockchain promises to do the same for financial services.\n\nInternational Business Times explained that this technology works almost like a shared Google Sheets spreadsheet, allowing multiple parties to view, edit and validate a transaction, eliminating the need for a middleman.\n\nSuccessful tests with mainstream banks such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have shown that blockchain can indeed cut costs and make financial transactions more efficient.\n\n“In 10 years there may be no more stock exchanges and far fewer banks and so forth. All of these things can be made 90 percent cheaper by introducing this technology,” said David Yermack,\n\n“Financial services are going to get a lot cheaper for most people.”\n\nIf blockchain continues to gain traction, the magazine explains, everything from buying homes to using debit cards could be drastically different in the near future.\n\n“In an industry that has been extremely resistant to change, the implications for financial institutions that do not adapt to the emerging technology could be devastating,” it finally states."", 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'From bitcoin to blockchain to distributed ledgers, the cryptocurrency space is fast evolving, to the point where it can be difficult to see in which direction it\'s headed.\n\nBut, we\'re not without clues. While many of the innovations in the space are new, they\'re built on decades of work that led to this point. By tracing this history, we can understand the motivations behind the movement that spawned bitcoin and share its vision for the future.\n\nBefore the 1970s, cryptography was primarily practiced in secret by military or spy agencies. But, that changed when two publications brought it into the open: the US government publication of the Data Encryption Standard and the first publicly available work on public-key cryptography, ""New Directions in Cryptography"" by Dr Whitfield Diffie and Dr Martin Hellman.\n\nIn the 1980s, Dr David Chaum wrote extensively on topics such as anonymous digital cash and pseudonymous reputation systems, which he described in his paper ""Security without Identification: Transaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete"".\n\nOver the next several years, these ideas coalesced into a movement.\n\nIn late 1992, Eric Hughes, Timothy C May, and John Gilmore founded a small group that met monthly at Gilmore\'s company Cygnus Solutions in the San Francisco Bay Area. The group was humorously termed “cypherpunks” as a derivation of “cipher” and “cyberpunk.”\n\nThe Cypherpunks mailing list was formed at about the same time, and just a few months later, Eric Hughes published ""A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto"".\n\nHe wrote:\n\n""Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.""\n\nThat’s all good and well, you may be thinking, but I’m not a Cypherpunk, I’m not doing anything wrong; I have nothing to hide. As Bruce Schneier has noted, the ""nothing to hide"" argument stems from a faulty premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong.\n\nFor example, you likely have curtains over your windows so that people can\'t see into your home. This isn’t because you are undertaking illegal or immoral activities, but simply because you don’t wish to worry about the potential cost of revealing yourself to the outside world.\n\nIf you’re reading this, you have directly benefited from the efforts of Cypherpunks.\n\nSome notable Cypherpunks and their achievements:\n\nJacob Appelbaum: Tor developer\n\n\n\nJulian Assange: Founder of WikiLeaks\n\n\n\nDr Adam Back: Inventor of Hashcash, co-founder of Blockstream\n\n\n\nBram Cohen: Creator of BitTorrent\n\n\n\nHal Finney: Main author of PGP 2.0, creator of Reusable Proof of Work\n\n\n\nTim Hudson: Co-author of SSLeay, the precursor to OpenSSL\n\n\n\nPaul Kocher: Co-author of SSL 3.0\n\n\n\nMoxie Marlinspike: Founder of Open Whisper Systems (developer of Signal)\n\n\n\nSteven Schear: Creator of the concept of the ""warrant canary""\n\n\n\nBruce Schneier: Well-known security author\n\n\n\nZooko Wilcox-O\'Hearn: DigiCash developer, Founder of Zcash\n\n\n\nPhilip Zimmermann: Creator of PGP 1.0\n\nThe 1990s\n\nThis decade saw the rise of the Crypto Wars, in which the US Government attempted to stifle the spread of strong commercial encryption.\n\nSince the market for cryptography was almost entirely military up to this point, encryption technology was included as a Category XIII item into the US Munitions List, which had strict regulations preventing its ""export.""\n\nThis limited ""export compatible"" SSL key length to 40 bits, which could be broken in a matter of days using a single personal computer.\n\nLegal challenges by civil libertarians and privacy advocates, the widespread availability of encryption software outside the US and a successful attack by Matt Blaze against the government’s proposed backdoor, the Clipper Chip, led the government to back down.\n\nIn 1997, Dr Adam Back created Hashcash, which was designed as an anti-spam mechanism that would essentially add a (time and computational) cost to sending email, thus making spam uneconomical.\n\nHe envisioned that Hashcash would be easier for people to use than Chaum’s digicash since there was no need for the creation of an account. Hashcash even had some protection against ""double spending.""\n\nLater in 1998, Wei Dai published a proposal for ""b-money"", a practical way to enforce contractual agreements between anonymous actors. He described two interesting concepts that should sound familiar. First, a protocol in which every participant maintains a separate database of how much money belongs to user. Secondly, a variant of the first system where the accounts of who has how much money are kept by a subset of the participants who are incentivized to remain honest by putting their money on the line.\n\nBitcoin uses the former concept while quite a few other cryptocurrencies have implemented a variant of the latter concept, which we now call proof of stake.\n\nThe 2000s\n\nIt’s clear that Cypherpunks had already been building on each other\'s work for decades, experimenting and laying the frameworks we needed in the 1990s, but a pivotal point was the creation of cypherpunk money in the 2000s.\n\nIn 2004, Hal Finney created reusable proof of work (RPOW), which built on Back\'s Hashcash. RPOWs were unique cryptographic tokens that could only be used once, much like unspent transaction outputs in bitcoin. However, validation and protection against double spending was still performed by a central server.\n\nNick Szabo published a proposal for ""bit gold"" in 2005 – a digital collectible that built upon Finney’s RPOW proposal. However, Szabo did not propose a mechanism for limiting the total units of bit gold, but rather envisioned that units would be valued differently based upon the amount of computational work performed to create them.\n\nFinally, in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for a still-unidentified individual or individuals, published the bitcoin whitepaper, citing both hashcash and b-money. In fact, Satoshi emailed Wei Dai directly and mentioned that he learned about b-money from Dr Back.\n\nSatoshi dedicated a section of the bitcoin whitepaper to privacy, which reads:\n\n""The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the \'tape\', is made public, but without telling who the parties were.""\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto triggered an avalanche of progress with a working system that people could use, extend and fork.\n\nBitcoin strengthened the entire cypherpunk movement by enabling organizations such as WikiLeaks to continue operating via bitcoin donations, even after the traditional financial system had cut them off.\n\nThe Struggle for Privacy\n\nHowever, as the bitcoin ecosystem has grown over the past few years, privacy concerns seem to have been pushed to the backburner.\n\nMany early bitcoin users assumed that the system would give them complete anonymity, but we have learned otherwise as various law enforcement agencies have revealed that they are able to deanonymize bitcoin users during investigations.\n\nThe Open Bitcoin Privacy Project has picked up some of the slack with regard to educating users about privacy and recommending best practices for bitcoin services. The group is developing a threat model for attacks on bitcoin wallet privacy.\n\nTheir model currently breaks attackers into several categories:\n\nBlockchain Observers – link different transactions together to the same identity by observing patterns in the flow of value.\n\nNetwork Observers – link different transactions and addresses together by observing activity on the peer to peer network.\n\nPhysical Adversaries – try to find data on a wallet device in order to tamper with it or perform analysis upon it.\n\nTransaction Participants – create transactions that aid them in tracing and deanonymizing activity on the blockchain.\n\nWallet Providers – may require personally identifiable information from users and then observe their transactions.\n\nJonas Nick at Blockstream has also done a fair amount of research regarding privacy concerns for bitcoin users.\n\nHe has an excellent presentation in which he uncovers a number of privacy flaws, some of which are devastating to SPV bitcoin clients:\n\nOne of the greatest privacy issues in bitcoin is from blockchain observers – because every transaction on the network is indefinitely public, anyone in the present and future can be a potential adversary.\n\nAs a result, one of the oldest recommended best practices is to never reuse a bitcoin address.\n\nSatoshi even made note of it in the bitcoin whitepaper:\n\n""As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.""\n\nRecent Cypherpunk Innovations\n\nA multitude of systems and best practices have been developed in order to increase the privacy of bitcoin users. Dr Pieter Wuille authored BIP32, hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, which makes it much simpler for bitcoin wallets to manage addresses.\n\nWhile privacy was not Wuille\'s primary motivation, HD wallets make it easier to avoid address reuse because the tech can easily generate new addresses as transactions flow into and out of the wallet.\n\nElliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman-Merkle (ECDHM) addresses are bitcoin address schemes that increase privacy. ECDHM addresses can be shared publicly and are used by senders and receivers to secretly derive traditional Bitcoin addresses that blockchain observers cannot predict. The result is that ECDHM addresses can be ""reused"" without the loss of privacy that usually occurs from traditional Bitcoin address reuse.\n\nSome examples of ECDHM address schemes include Stealth Addresses by Peter Todd, BIP47 reusable payment codes by Justus Ranvier and BIP75 Out of Band Address Exchange by Justin Newton and others.\n\nBitcoin mixing is a more labor intensive method by which users can increase their privacy. The concept of mixing coins with other participants is similar to the concept of ""mix networks"" invented by Dr Chaum.\n\nSeveral different mixing algorithms have been developed:\n\nCoinJoin – Blockstream co-founder Gregory Maxwell’s original proposal for mixing coins, CoinJoin essentially lets users create a transaction with many inputs from multiple people and then send the coins to many other outputs that pay back to the same people, thus \'mixing\' the values together and making it difficult to tell which inputs are related to which outputs.\n\nJoinMarket – Built by developer Chris Belcher, JoinMarket enables holders of bitcoin to allow their coins to be mixed via CoinJoin with other users\' coins in return for a fee. It uses a kind of smart contract so that your private keys never leave your computer, thus reducing the risk of loss. Put simply, JoinMarket allows you to improve the privacy of bitcoin transactions for low fees in a decentralized fashion.\n\nCoinShuffle – A decentralized mixing protocol developed by a group of researchers at Saarland University in Germany, CoinShuffle improves upon CoinJoin. It does not require a trusted third party to assemble the mixing transactions and thus does not require additional mixing fees.\n\nCoinSwap – Another concept developed by Maxwell, CoinSwap is substantially different from CoinJoin in that it uses a series of four multisig transactions (two escrow payments, two escrow releases) to trustlessly swap coins between two parties. It is much less efficient than CoinJoin but can potentially offer much greater privacy, even facilitating the swapping of coins between different blockchains.\n\nWhile mixing is tantamount to ""hiding in a crowd"", often the crowd is not particularly large. Mixing should be considered as providing obfuscation rather than complete anonymity, because it makes it difficult for casual observers to trace the flow of funds, but more sophisticated observers may still be able to deobfuscate the mixing transactions.\n\nKristov Atlas (founder of the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project) posted his findings on weaknesses in improperly implemented CoinJoin clients back in 2014.\n\nAtlas noted that even with a fairly primitive analysis tool, he was able to group 69% of inputs and 53% of a single CoinJoin transaction\'s outputs.\n\nThere are even separate cryptocurrencies that have been developed with privacy in mind.\n\nOne example is Dash, designed by Evan Duffield \xadand Daniel Diaz, which has a feature called ""Darksend"" – an improved version of CoinJoin. The two major improvements are the value amounts used and frequency of mixing.\n\nDash’s mixing uses common denominations of 0.1DASH, 1DASH, 10DASH AND 100DASH in order to make grouping of inputs and outputs much more difficult. In each mixing session, users submit the same denominations as inputs and outputs.\n\nTo maximize the privacy offered by mixing and make timing attacks more difficult, Darksend runs automatically at set intervals.\n\nAnother privacy-focused cryptocurrency is not even based on bitcoin. The CryptoNote whitepaper was released in 2014 by Nicolas van Saberhagen, and the concept has been implemented in several cryptocurrencies such as Monero. The primary innovations are cryptographic ring signatures and unique one-time keys.\n\nRegular digital signatures, such as those used in bitcoin, involve a single pair of keys – one public and one private. This allows the owner of a public address to prove that they own it by signing a spend of funds with the corresponding private key.\n\nRing signatures were first proposed in 2001 by Dr Adi Shamir and others, building upon the group signature scheme that was introduced in 1991 by Dr Chaum and Eugene van Heyst. Ring signatures involve a group of individuals, each with their own private and public key.\n\nThe ""statement"" proved by a ring signature is that the signer of a given message is a member of the group. The main distinction with the ordinary digital signature schemes is that the signer needs a single secret key, but a verifier cannot establish the exact identity of the signer.\n\nTherefore, if you encounter a ring signature with the public keys of Alice, Bob and Carol, you can only claim that one of these individuals was the signer, but you will not be able to know exactly to whom the transaction belongs. It provides another level of obfuscation that makes it more difficult for blockchain observers to track the ownership of payments as they flow through the system.\n\nInteresting enough, ring signatures were developed specifically in the context of whistleblowing, as they enable the anonymous leaking of secrets while still proving that the source of the secrets is reputable (an individual who is part of a known group.)\n\nCryptoNote is also designed to mitigate the risks associated with key reuse and input-to-output tracing. Every address for a payment is a unique one-time key, derived from both the sender\'s and the recipient\'s data. As soon as you use a ring signature in your input, it adds more uncertainty as to which output has just been spent.\n\nIf a blockchain observer tries to draw a graph with used addresses, connecting them via the transactions on the blockchain, it will be a tree because no address was used twice. The number of possible graphs rises exponentially as you add more transactions to the graph since every ring signature produces ambiguity as to how the value flowed between the addresses.\n\nThus, you can\'t be certain of which address sent funds to another address.\n\nDepending on the size of the ring used for signing, the ambiguity for a single transaction can vary from ""one out of two"" to ""one out of 1,000"". Every transaction increases the entropy and creates additional difficulty for a blockchain observer.\n\nUpcoming Cypherpunk Innovations\n\nWhile there are still many privacy concerns for cryptocurrency users, the future is bright due to the ongoing work of Cypherpunks.\n\nThe next leap forward in privacy will involve the use of zero-knowledge proofs, which were first proposed in 1985 in order to broaden the potential applications of cryptographic protocols.\n\nOriginally proposed by Dr Back in 2013 as ""bitcoins with homomorphic value"", Maxwell has been working on Confidential Transactions, which use zero-knowledge range proofs to enable the creation of bitcoin transactions in which the values are hidden from everyone except the transaction participants.\n\nThis is a great improvement on its own, but when you combine Confidential Transactions with CoinJoin then you can build a mixing service that severs any links between transaction inputs and outputs.\n\nWhen Maxwell presented Sidechain Elements at the San Francisco Bitcoin Devs meetup, I recall him saying ""One of the greatest regrets held by the greybeards at the IETF is that the Internet was not built with encryption as the default method of transmitting data.""\n\nMaxwell clearly feels the same way about privacy in bitcoin and wishes that we had Confidential Transactions from the very beginning. We have already seen Blockstream implement confidential transactions within the Liquid sidechain in order to mask transfers between exchanges.\n\nWe also recently saw Maxwell conduct the first successful zero-knowledge contingent payment on the bitcoin network. ZKCP is a transaction protocol that allows a buyer to purchase information from a seller using bitcoin in a trustless manner. The purchased information is only transferred if the payment is made, and it is guaranteed to be transferred if the payment is made. The buyer and seller do not need to trust each other or depend on arbitration by a third party.\n\nI wrote about Zerocoin several years ago and noted the technical challenges that it needed to overcome before the system could be useable. Since then, researchers have managed to make the proofs much more efficient and have solved the trust problem with the initial generation of the system parameters. We are now on the cusp of seeing Zerocoin\'s vision realized with the release of Zcash, headed by Wilcox-O\'Hearn.\n\nZcash offers total payment confidentiality while still maintaining a decentralized network using a public blockchain. Zcash transactions automatically hide the sender, recipient and value of all transactions on the blockchain. Only those with the correct view key can see the contents of a transaction. Since the contents of Zcash transactions are encrypted and private, the system uses a novel cryptographic method to verify payments.\n\nZcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by its team of experienced cryptographers.\n\nInstead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that the transaction is valid. Zcash may very well be the first digital payment system that enables foolproof anonymity.\n\nPutting the Punk in Cypherpunk\n\nIn the decades since the Cypherpunks set forth on their quest, computer technology has advanced to the point where individuals and groups can communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner.\n\nTwo persons may exchange messages, conduct business and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the true name or legal identity of the other. It is only natural that governments will try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by criminals and fears of societal disintegration.\n\nObama: If govt. can’t crack encryption, then people are walking around ""with a Swiss bank account in their pocket.""https://t.co/PkZlq9sOl7 — CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) March 11, 2016\n\nCypherpunks know that we must defend our privacy if we expect to have any. People have been defending their privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes and couriers.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, technology did not enable strong privacy, but neither did it enable affordable mass surveillance.\n\nWe now live in a world where surveillance is to be expected, but privacy is not, even though privacy enhancing technologies exist. We have entered a phase that many are calling The Crypto Wars 2.0.\n\nAlthough the Cypherpunks emerged victorious from the first Crypto Wars, we cannot afford to rest upon our laurels. Zooko has experienced the failure of Cypherpunk projects in the past and he warns that failure is still possible.\n\nDear fellow Bitcoiners: no, we cannot just rest assured that Bitcoin\'s unique value prop outweighs all other considerations. — zooko (@zooko) January 6, 2016\n\nCypherpunks believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, including privacy from governments. They understand that the weakening of a system’s security for any reason, including access by ""trusted authorities"", makes the system insecure for everyone who uses it.\n\nCypherpunks write code. They know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and thus they take up the task. They publish their code so that fellow Cypherpunks may learn from it, attack it and improve upon it.\n\nTheir code is free for anyone to use.

Interested in offering your expertise or insights to our reporting? Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Addison Cameron-Huff is an independent technology lawyer who focusses on the bitcoin and Internet startup space. His clients include prominent blockchain businesspeople and developers.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Cameron-Huff builds on thoughts voiced in a recent panel discussion at CIGI\'s blockchain workshop held in Toronto.\n\nDespite the levels of hype, ""blockchain"" is, at its core, a software concept like relational databases or BitTorrent.\n\nProponents argue it is set to change real estate, accounting, securities and a gamut of other industries. But, how should this technology be regulated? A better question might be, \'Should it be?\' And if so, \'How?\'\n\nLawmakers generally try to create rules that are technology neutral. Indeed, one of the most pressing criticisms of New York\'s BitLicense regulation was that it deviated from this approach.\n\nWhy this has been successful is because regulators know that software developers move faster than they do.\n\nWhen rules are created for specific technologies, there’s a danger that rapid innovation will result in hollow laws on the books (eg semiconductor topography protection). The term ""blockchain"" has only been in use for a few years and no one can confidently whether this specific iteration of the technology will win out (although some people are working on blockchain prediction markets to help with that).\n\nStill, many believe blockchain technology holds enormous promise, even if there are very few applications in the field right now. There’s no evidence of any problems and lots of evidence of innovation. There’s a growing consensus in the developed world that before government rules are created, there should be a critical analysis of the benefits and costs.\n\nThis type of analysis is essential to avoid smothering desirable changes in the name of avoiding potential (or actual) costs to society. Blockchain technology may have costs (in specific implementations) but there are enormous potential gains.\n\nExercise in futility\n\nEven if a convincing case were made to regulate blockchain, how would this be done? By regulating what sort of code people can create?\n\nAttempts in the US to regulate cryptography in the 1990s show the futility and costs of this approach. Focusing on the ends rather than the means would be a more promising regulatory avenue. But, the “ends” of blockchain are so varied that this won\'t be a useful exercise.\n\nTime spent creating regulations for blockchain technologies means time not spent honing or creating regulations for larger societal issues.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the ecosystem\'s two largest public blockchains, have a combined global market cap of under $10bn. By comparison, $10tn worth of gold is traded each quarter.\n\nRegulators have far bigger fish to fry – time spent dealing with blockchain is time not spent dealing with more impactful issues.\n\nTime will come\n\nStill, that\'s not to say regulation won\'t ever be necessary.\n\nBlockchain technologies may in the future cause major changes for highly regulated industries like securities trading or real estate. One way that this technological change could trigger a need for regulatory change is if the new technologies reduce the number of middlemen (layers) in the industry.\n\nIf blockchain businesses and applications can merge the layers of a system then there may be a need to consolidate or rethink the regulatory scheme to fit the new reality.\n\nFor example, if one system can handle land title registration, viewing and transfer, then perhaps the regulations can be consolidated to regulate the new actor that takes on the roles of several old ones.\n\nBlockchain technologies will be built into products and services that decentralize our world.\n\nThere will be some changes to existing services, jobs and industries but so far there’s no evidence that these changes are clear enough, urgent enough or large enough to justify any kind of blanket regulation of blockchain technology.\n\nMan with toaster image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The NAA claims to have 17 member companies and more than 1,200 newspapers.\n\nBrave will pay advertisers, users, agencies and publishers in bitcoin.\n\n“Brave’s proposed business model crosses legal and ethical boundaries, and should be viewed as illegal and deceptive by the courts, consumers and those who value the creation of content,” David Chavern, NAA CEO, stated in a letter.\n\nNAA States Its Case\n\nThe NAA letter said its sites and mobile applications give news reporting, video content, feature writing and photojournalism that is edited, researched and produced at “extraordinary” cost. The industry spends more than $5 billion per year on reporting in the U.S., and it distributes it online for free or at “highly subsidized rates” with online ad revenue.\n\nChavern said Brave should feel free to create its own content on its own platforms, but it cannot launch its advertising business “on the backs of our journalists, editors, technologists and other staff.”\n\nThe letter lists ways that Brave’s business model violates publishing rights to protect copyrighted content and trademarks.\n\nThe letter stated that Brave’s plan to allow customers to make bitcoin donations to NAA’s websites and for Brave to donate an unstated percentage of its revenue from the sale of ads to the NAA’s websites does not begin to compensate for the loss of its ability to fund its work by displaying its own advertising.\n\nNAA Rejects Brave’s Offer\n\nThe NAA rejected compensation or consideration Brave will offer as part of its ad-replacing scheme, and refused to accept any “site wallet” that Brave would create for NAA’s benefit.\n\nNAA said Brave is not authorized to use NAA’s trademarks, logos or names in any way connected to the operation of Brave’s business.\n\nNAA noted that it stands ready to enforce all legal rights to protect copyrighted content and trademarks and to prevent Brave from deceiving consumers and unlawfully appropriating NAA’s work. The NAA said it reserves the right to seek remedies for infringement including but not limited to statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work.\n\nNAA also said it believes Brave’s plan will constitute unfair competition and misappropriation under law.\n\nBrave Responds\n\nBrave disputed the NAA’s points on a blog.\n\nBrave said its goal is to make the browsing experience easier, to allow users to see ads they are more likely to want to see, and to enable all parties to receive revenue in the process. The last part of this proposition – remuneration – is where bitcoin comes in. Brave will pay advertisers, users, agencies and publishers in bitcoin.\n\nBrave said the NAA used false assertions and has misunderstood Brave. It listed the following misconceptions:\n\n1. Brave is not replacing publishers’ ads on publishers’ websites and mobile apps with Brave’s own advertising. Brave said it does not tamper with any first-party publisher content, such as native ads that don’t use third-party tracking.\n\n2. Brave is not attempting to steal profits from publishers. Brave is creating a better ad network with a bespoke browser connected anonymously to the network. Brave will pay the publishers more for the shared revenue through its system than most websites are currently receiving from third-party ads.\n\n3. The NAA letter is incorrect in stating Brave will share an unspecified percentage of revenue when its revenue share split has been fixed from its January preview release.\n\nBrave said it provides the lion’s share to websites. The default money from its ad-share model flows to up to 70% of ad revenue to site publishers, which is greater than the average percentage in the existing display ad ecosystem. Brave keeps 15% and permits the end user to choose to donate or maintain their 15% share. Keeping their share still delivers 55% ad revenue share to site owners, which surpasses the current 45% average.\n\n\n\n4. As the news industry is declining, Brave’s model changes this by sending more ad revenue to publishers and enabling users to pay them directly.\n\n\n\n5. Excessive, abusive and dangerous advertising drives users to adopt ad blockers, a trend that will not change due to legal threats, harsh language or server-side anti-blocker countermeasures. Brave noted that malware entered the websites of the BBC and The New York Times recently on account of a poorly-delegated, third-party technology ecosystem.\n\nBrave Calls Itself A Solution\n\nBrave argues it is a solution and not a problem for content users and publishers. It claims to provide privacy, protection from malware, speed, and an anonymous payment model that supports the industry and publishers in particular compared to the status quo.\n\nThe violation of individual privacy has reached “epidemic” proportions, Brave stated. The NAA letter misconstrues how browsers and web standards work by design. The web allows users to consume content in any presentation and combination that user-selected software can provide.\n\nBrowsers do not simply play back recorded pixel from publisher sites. Instead, browsers are an end-user agent to mediate and combine all the content elements, including third-party ads and first-party publisher news stories. Web content publishes as HTML markup documents with the mission of not specifying how content is presented to the browser user.\n\nBrowsers can rearrange, ignore mash up and make use of content from any source.\n\nIf Brave browsers performed “republication,” the Safari’s Reader mode does the same thing, Brave noted. This is true for any browser with an ad blocker extension, the links text-only browser, or screen readers for visually impaired people.\n\nNAA Out Of Line?\n\n“Make no mistake: this NAA letter is the first shot fired in a war on all ad-blockers, not just on Brave,” the letter noted.\n\nBrave said it is willing to discuss with NAA how the solution can be a win-win for its users and the publishers they browse.\n\n“We will fight alongside all citizens of the Internet who deserve and demand a better deal than they are getting from today’s increasingly abusive approach to web advertising,” Brave noted.\n\nImages from Brave.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

But for the company’s employees and more than 80,000 people watching SpaceX’s live web cast, the real excitement began when Falcon 9 completed its burn, began its descent and perfected a vertical landing on the drone ship for the first time.\n\n“1st stage has landed on Of Course I Still Love You,” SpaceX said in a tweet, naming the ship. The company’s drone ships — there are two — are a nod to the late Scottish science fiction writer Iain M. Banks.\n\nSpaceX made history in December by successfully landing the first stage on land but had yet to complete the same goal on a ship. Four previous attempts were marred by “hard landings” and video footage of fiery explosions. Reusable rockets that land themselves — unlike the traditional model in which the rocket is left to burn up on re-entry — are a critical aspect of reducing the cost to reach orbit. Musk has said that a fully and rapidly reusable rocket is the only way to enable humans to travel to and from Mars.\n\nThe company webcasts each of its launches, and young engineers provide running commentary. This time, however, the screams of excitement and joy from the SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California, overrode the commentary.\n\nSpaceX has said it expects to have 18 launches this year, three times the number of missions flown in 2015. Ocean landings are critical for SpaceX going forward. While some rockets can return to land, factors like the size of the payload, amount of fuel, orbits and trajectories make ocean landings necessary.\n\n“The rocket landed instead of putting a hole in the ship or tipping over, so we are really excited about that,” Musk said during a post-launch press conference Friday with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. “About half of our missions will need to land out at sea.”\n\nSpaceX’s Dragon cargo capsule is ferrying 7,000 pounds of supplies, science experiments, and technology demonstrations to the space station, an orbiting science lab. Friday’s launch marks SpaceX’s first mission to the space station since last June, when Falcon 9 blew apart 139 seconds after launch. An initial investigation into that mishap pointed to a 2-foot-long, 1-inch-thick strut in a liquid oxygen tank that snapped.', 'Das Bitcoin-Whitepaper zu lesen, also das allererste Dokument, in dem Satoshi Nakamoto sein Konzept von Bitcoin als “Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” vorstellt, ist schon etwas Eigenartiges.

VR’s most obvious use, however, is in powering new kinds of video games. Sony’s PlayStation VR is already showing great promise in this area.\n\nI tried several games on Sony’s upcoming virtual reality platform this week. The PlayStation VR, which must be connected to a PlayStation 4 to work, won’t be available to buy until October. Even so, many of the demos I tried already feel as polished as finished games.\n\nThe PlayStation VR (SNE) has a single strap securing the device to your head, similar to a visor, that lets you pull the goggles over your eyes where they feel most comfortable. A one-button adjustment process makes changing the size of the band simple. Another mechanism lets you move the device’s screen closer to or farther away from your face, helpful for gamers with glasses. All told, Sony’s goggles are easier to adjust than rival devices.\n\nHTC Vive Demos a Reality at GameStop and Microsoft Stores\n\nThe PlayStation VR offers gamers two different control methods. Gamers can choose to use a standard PlayStation DualShock gamepad, or opt for a pair of the company’s Move motion controllers depending on the game.\n\nThe most riveting game I played was Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, which drops you onto a nightmarish train ride through an abandoned carnival. The game occasionally goes completely dark, giving ghoulish enemies the chance to sneak up on you without being seen. Sony’s Move controllers let you control virtual guns, your only defense against the horrific onslaught. It’s the kind of game that would be scary enough on a two-dimensional screen, but it’s completely horrifying in virtual reality.\n\nCourtesy of Sony\n\nAnother title, Waltz of the Wizard, makes you feel like you have superpowers. The game requires you to pick up a tiny ball that contains a spell, and drop it into a steaming cauldron. Dipping your hand into the resulting potion bestows certain powers, like the ability to transform objects in the room just by touching them, Midas-style. You can also lift objects and toss them around, as in Job Simulator, another popular VR game. Unfortunately, I had trouble lifting certain objects, but gameplay was smooth overall. Waltz of the Wizard is a good demonstration of how Sony’s Move controllers can make interactions inside VR games feel more real.\n\nFor more on VR, watch:\n\nI tried some enjoyable puzzle games, too. Tumble is like a more complex and virtual Jenga. The challenge: Stack the blocks you’re given without knocking any of them over. But the objects range in size and shape, making the task more challenging. What makes Tumble particularly interesting in virtual reality is the ability to examine your pieces up close from any angle, offering a more thorough inspection than you would get from staring at a screen.\n\nCourtesy of Sony\n\nSuper Hypercube is a virtual take on Hole in the Wall that’s equally straightforward yet tough to master. You’re thrust into a colorful tunnel, where you must rotate a given shape so it fits through an opening in a wall rushing toward you. Like Tumble, it’s a game that doesn’t need to be played in VR, but it’s far more interesting this way.\n\nSony Explains How Star Wars Battlefront Will Sell PlayStation VR\n\nIt’s too early to compare Sony’s PlayStation VR to the high-end virtual reality headsets already on the market, like the Oculus Rift (FB) and the HTC Vive. But it does boast advantages on paper. It will be cheaper, for one, at $399 versus $599 for the Rift and $799 for the Vive. It’s more comfortable to wear. And it only requires owners also have a PlayStation 4, whereas those other headsets demand a high-end, expensive gaming computer.\n\nStill, both of those rival devices will see upgrades before PlayStation VR ships in October. More and better games will appear on both platforms. And Oculus’ gesture-sensitive controllers are scheduled to ship later this year. But with more than 30 million PlayStation 4 units in use worldwide, PlayStation VR could be the device that makes virtual reality gaming go mainstream.\n\nThis article was originally published on Time.com']"
04/10/2016,"['What seems more likely, however, is how organizations like IS get their funding through money laundering, a scheme that has been plaguing traditional finance for quite some time.\n\nThe topic of the involvement of Bitcoin in terrorism funding has been kicked around a few times in the past, but it looks like there is no end in sight. Amit Kumar, a US-based terror expert, feels it is vital to disrupting terrorism financing, references to Bitcoin in this context as playing a role that further warrants investigation.\n\nAlso read: Storj, the New Decentralized Cloud Storage Platform Goes Live\n\nMore References to Bitcoin and Terrorism Funding\n\nIt is not the first time someone mentions Bitcoin and terrorism funding in the same sentence. In fact, these types of discussions date back to 2015, when US law enforcement arrested a teen who was allegedly communicating with IS supporters. To be more precise, this advice touched upon the subject of using Bitcoin for funding purposes, as it would leave little to no trail.\n\nBitcoin users will gladly tell Mr. Kumar how Bitcoin transactions are the least viable option for terrorism funding, as the blockchain acts as a real-time ledger for any transaction in the world. However, he did mention how it is possible to effectively monitor Bitcoin transactions, and how the banking system should pay more attention to this concept.\n\nAmit Kumar explained his thoughts as follows:\n\n“If a bitcoin user buys a bitcoin, he does intersect the banking system by the way of PayPal or some online intersectional inter-phase of a bank. By monitoring, you can try to avert the potential use of Bitcoin by a criminal or a terrorist. Otherwise, the bitcoin transaction and usage becomes anonymous.”\n\nUp until this point, there is still no tangible evidence one single Satoshi – which is worth 0.00000001 Bitcoin – has ever been used for terrorism funding. No one is saying it is entirely unlikely Bitcoin has played a role in terrorism funding to date. But since there is no proof to back up these claims, the jury is still out.\n\nWhat seems more likely, however, is how organizations like IS get their funding through money laundering, a scheme that has been plaguing traditional finance for quite some time. As the recent Panama Papers story has shown the world, Bitcoin would involve far too many hoops to jump through for money laundering purposes, whereas the banking system seems more tailored towards such a purpose.\n\nAdditionally. Kumar strongly feels the communication networks used by terrorist organizations need to be shut down. Coming up with counter solutions is far more difficult than initially assumed, however, and has lead to strange proposals such as weakening device encryption for consumers in the US. These ideas were not greeted with a lot of enthusiasm and have been put on the backburner\n\nSource: Big News Network\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Bitcoin is not a gold standard as it is independent, without the intervention of any central bank or government agency. Read more...\n\nThere has been a lot of comparison between bitcoin and gold in the recent times. Bitcoin has been compared to gold in many aspects. In fact, bitcoin is also called digital gold for a reason due to various similarities it shares with the yellow material. However, referring to bitcoin as a gold standard may not be relevant.\n\nThe gold standard is a reference to the monetary system that was based on the value of gold. While most countries stopped following the gold standard long ago. There are three different forms of gold standards that were in practice, gold specie standard where gold coins were in circulation and then there was gold bullion standard where the government sold bullion on demand at a fixed price in place of currency. As these practices became impractical, the gold exchange standard was put in place where the government promises certain fixed exchange rate to currency from other foreign currencies.\n\nComparing bitcoin to the gold standard will inevitably bring in the central bank and trusted third parties into the fold, which is everything that the digital currency stands against. Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized, distributed open source peer to peer monetary system that works without the involvement of a trusted third party. In order to prevent any intervention and still to be able to function as a currency, individuals (miners) play the role of a trusted party. Miners facilitate transactions by confirming them and registering the same on a distributed ledger called blockchain.\n\nThe value of bitcoin is not dependent on the value of gold or any other fiat currency. However, bitcoin’s value can be hedged against the value of both gold and different fiat currencies. at the same time, the digital currency is capable of performing all the functions of money, which is similar to that of gold but still not the same as gold standard.\n\nSome of the similarities shared between gold and bitcoin are same as the properties of ideal money. These features include –\n\nDurability – Bitcoin and gold are both durable. While gold being an inert metal can withstand chemical reactions to stand the test of time, Bitcoin will continue to exist as long as the internet is around.\n\nTransferability – In order to serve its purpose, it should be possible to change hands easily. Both bitcoin and gold can be both physically transferred and exchanged in return for other currency, goods, and services.\n\nScarcity – Something in excess supply will not have enough demand. Luckily both gold and bitcoin scare. There will be only 29000000 bitcoins in circulation ever making it valuable enough to be a medium of exchange.\n\nDivisibility – Bitcoin is highly divisible, it can have divided by 100000000 times. However, with gold, it is not that easy but yet possible.\n\nFungibility – Bitcoin and gold are fungible, they can be easily substituted by another bitcoin or the same quantity of gold without any change in the value.\n\nRecognizability – Both bitcoin and gold are both impossible to counterfeit and it can be easily detected.\n\nAll these factors make bitcoin more of a money than all the other forms of money out there.\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC', 'Ryan X Charles is the founder of the decentralized content sharing platform DATT and a former cryptocurrency engineer at social network Reddit.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Charles discusses why he is building his platform on the bitcoin protocol even despite the emergence of new blockchain platforms such as Ethereum.\n\nSince last summer when I announced Datt, an in-development social media platform and application powered by bitcoin, one of the top questions I’ve been asked is, ""Why are you using bitcoin?""\n\nLast year, this question often took a different form. I was asked ""Why not use Stripe?” or ""Why not make an altcoin?"" Since the rally in Ethereum over the past few months, the question has morphed into ""Why not use Ethereum?""\n\nThe answer is because Datt only needs Internet money right now, not advanced smart contracts, and switching to Ethereum would incur a large technical and economic cost which would ultimately fail to deliver a proportional return.\n\nIf we simply prioritize our feature set, we can and will add advanced smart contracts based on bitcoin when the time is right. Ethereum, at a protocol level, is arguably more advanced than bitcoin. Since it is Turing-complete, it has solved the limitation of the scripting language built into bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the economy around Ethereum is much more limited than bitcoin, and therefore Ethereum is less useful for Datt.\n\nPossible paths\n\nBecause Ethereum has a very different protocol than bitcoin, it isn\'t easy for bitcoin companies to add support for Ethereum.\n\nRoughly speaking, bitcoin companies have three options:\n\nIncrease the technical complexity of their platform by adding Ethereum support to their bitcoin support Drop their assets in the bitcoin space but keep complexity limited by switching from bitcoin to Ethereum Solve the hard problems in bitcoin by designing and building complicated systems.\n\nSome companies will choose option one, increasing technical complexity by supporting both Ethereum and bitcoin. This is a mistake.\n\nRather than shaping their own future, these companies will let their fate be decided by the whims of speculators and hype. I am bearish on companies that divide their effort between two conflicting visions of the future. With the exception of exchanges, they will fail.\n\nOther companies will choose option two, dropping assets in the bitcoin space and supporting Ethereum instead. I think this is a valid option for some companies.\n\nIf a company never had strong assets in bitcoin, perhaps they can find a new niche in the Ethereum space. They will take a hit by pivoting, but they could still succeed over the long-term.\n\nHowever, this path is not actually any easier than the bitcoin path. I predict these companies will ultimately be faced with the same problem they are facing now — lack of traction. They will still have to solve hard problems, but at a later date, and with a smaller market.\n\nOption three is to solve the hard problems in bitcoin.\n\nThis is being tackled by companies like Blockstream, 21, OneName and OB1, the development team behind OpenBazaar. These companies see bitcoin as the largest and most secure foundation for the future of finance and information services.\n\nWhen they encounter problems, they solve them by writing code rather than pivoting to a different platform.\n\nThis is the path that I am taking with Datt, with the help of my collaborators. For example, since the bitcoin block size is limited and has recently caused transaction fees to rise, we have started implementing a solution based on payment channels.\n\nNew problems\n\nPivoting to Ethereum wouldn’t eliminate problems for Datt – it would just create new and different problems, and delay our success.\n\nThe most useful, important and revolutionary application of blockchain technology is Internet money.\n\nBitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto had the right goal and made the right economic decisions when designing bitcoin, in particular limiting the supply of bitcoins to 21 million. The incentives the network and encourages global adoption of bitcoin over the long-term.\n\nIt will not be possible for Ethereum or other platforms to outcompete bitcoin at its core value proposition.\n\nDatt, like our older cousins in the space, see an opportunity to service an enormous future market based on bitcoin, not by waiting for other people to solve the hard problems for us, but by solving them ourselves.\n\nNote, I haven’t studied Ethereum in detail at a technical level, so I take its developers at their word that they have solved the Turing-completeness problem correctly. However, I suspect that there are many other less obvious problems around its ability to scale that will need to be solved, just as with bitcoin.\n\nAnd since bitcoin has a larger economy and a longer head start on solving these problems, I am not convinced that Ethereum, at an ecosystem level, is more advanced than bitcoin or will be able to outpace it.\n\nQuestion mark image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

This is what we are currently engaged in. While we hate having the service offline, it was the safer path.”\n\nSafe by design\n\nShapeShift itself works as a platform that allows users to exchange Bitcoin and other cyrptocurrencies directly, so at no stage does ShapeShift itself hold onto funds, meaning that even here where the company was hacked directly, there was nothing, aside from the company’s own funds, for the hacker to steal.\n\n“We’ve built customer protection into our platform – hacks may be inevitable, but customer losses should not be,” Voorhees added. “Not a cent of customer funds was lost, nor could they have been.”\n\nAn update from Voorhees Sunday night committed ShapeShift to further ongoing transparency in relation to the hack, with a promise to provide more details of what happened later, as well as a full post-mortem once work on the site is complete.\n\n“A proper forensic investigation takes some time. ShapeShift’s service will be offline for at least another 48 hours while we continue to work. There is no danger or risk that ShapeShift will not be coming back online, but it needs to be done with diligence. We are learning some interesting things,” Voorhees noted.\n\n“I’d like to sincerely thank many in the industry who reached out to us, offering to help and providing valuable intelligence. It has been heartwarming, to say the least.”\n\nIt’s refreshing to see this level of transparency when something like this occurs, and while it’s unfortunate it has caused ShapeShift to go offline for now, we wish them a speedy recovery and return to business.\n\nAny customers who had pending orders on ShapeShift at the time the site was taken offline should constant customer support to have their balances returned.\n\nImage credit: ShapeShift', 'Igot: Bitcoin investors \'owed thousands of dollars\' by struggling Australian exchange\n\nUpdated\n\nAustralian-founded bitcoin exchange Igot appears on the verge of collapse, with dozens of customers and clients claiming to be owed hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nKey points: Customers say they bought Bitcoin through Igot but never received them or a refund\n\nA former Igot advisor claims the company was insolvent in 2014\n\nThe company\'s owner says the money will be returned to investors\n\nThe company, which buys and sells bitcoins on behalf of customers, has for months been unable to completely deliver on those bitcoins or refund their money.\n\nIts owner Rick Day admitted to the ABC that he was struggling to pay customers.\n\n""I am well aware that customers are affected and customers are really unhappy with this but I would like to show each and every one that we have not lost their money. We have not run away with anything and we will return the money,"" Mr Day told the ABC.\n\nThat, according to bitcoin investors, is little comfort.\n\nEgyptian-born Akram Bekzada invested with Igot in 2014.\n\nHe has been trying to withdraw $13,000 worth of bitcoins since October last year.\n\n""I think Igot are not being transparent. They are not really speaking up about what is the issue that\'s holding our money back,"" he said.\n\n""A lot of times they give reasons that don\'t stack up. A lot of times they say we have a problem with cash flow and then they say we cannot transfer bitcoins or we cannot cancel the transaction and transfer bitcoin.""\n\nPerth millionaire Zhenya Tsvetnenko\'s company Digital CC is owed $180,000. Digital CC is taking action in the WA Supreme Court to windup 13th Pty Ltd — the business entity of Igot.\n\nDo you know more about this story? Email investigations@abc.net.au\n\nMr Day dismissed the court action as ""merely a commercial dispute"".\n\n""Our lawyers are working with theirs to have it resolved. I\'m confident it will be resolved,"" he said.\n\nIgot is an international bitcoin exchange which claims to have several offices around the world.\n\nIt was founded in 2013, with Rick Day moving to New York shortly afterwards to work on the business with American co-founder Patrick Manasse.\n\nMr Day told the ABC that Igot has been doing ""really well"" since it was founded in 2013. He said it had only been the last few months where the company had struggled.\n\nBitcoin essentially is internet money, and a bitcoin exchange works in a similar way to a foreign currency exchange.\n\nA person makes a bank deposit to the exchange in a supported currency to buy bitcoins. You use these balances to trade in bitcoins with other users of the exchange, and then you are meant to be able withdraw that money.\n\nTransfers are almost instant, with far fewer fees, and the risk is minimal unless the actual exchange itself commits a fraud, becomes insolvent or withholds the money.\n\nIgot \'was insolvent\' a few years ago: former advisor\n\nAmerican entrepreneur Jesse Chenard, who worked with Igot as an advisor in 2014, was excited by the prospect of working in the emerging space of bitcoin.\n\nIn a media release picked up by the Australian media in June 2014, Mr Day trumpeted that they had ""managed to secure prominent US entrepreneur"" Mr Chenard as both a major investor and company advisor.\n\nBut Mr Chenard told the ABC a different a story. Before he invested any money, he looked into Igot\'s finances and found things were not quite right.\n\n""I think at that time Igot was insolvent but because Rick claimed to have other assets and because everything was murky and in his name and what have you, he claimed that he was able to cover it and it was a small accounting thing,"" he said.\n\n""So as to whether the company was insolvent? I would say the balance sheet looked pretty crappy.""\n\nAccording to Mr Chenard, Igot was not buying enough bitcoin for the amount of money it was taking in.\n\n""What people thought that they had bought with their Australian dollars or Indian rupees or US dollars or whatever currency they were dealing in — they hadn\'t been actually bought. It hadn\'t been bought for them,"" Mr Chenard said.\n\nMr Chenard stopped advising Igot and decided against investing. He told his friend Patrick Manasse to bail — which he did in 2014.\n\nThe pair went on to form their own company that works with the technology underpinning bitcoin.\n\nMr Day told the ABC that there was a falling out with Mr Chenard because Mr Chenard wanted more equity in Igot.\n\nMr Day maintains the company was — and is — solvent.\n\n""[Jesse Chenard] saw our system, how it worked, and he went and started his own thing. So as far as Jesse Chenard is concerned I am making no further comment,"" Mr Day said.\n\nCustomers take to social media demanding refunds\n\nWhether the pair had a falling out or not, it still does not account for the investors who have not been paid by Igot.\n\nThere are a multitude of complaints on Reddit, Facebook and other social media from people claiming they have been ""robbed"" by Igot. But there is one person who recently received half his money back.\n\nOwen Champion, a software developer from the NSW Central Coast, had been trying for months to withdraw his $7,000 worth of bitcoin. He was recently made redundant and is desperate for his money.\n\nMr Champion posted online that he had been interviewed by the ABC, and soon after Mr Day paid half his money back.\n\n""It pisses me off. It took me forever to save up that money and I just assumed that since they\'re in Australia there would be some sort of safety net or regulation or something like that — bare minimum — where he could be accountable for his actions and it seems like no-one\'s really helping,"" Mr Champion said.\n\nThere is very little government regulation around bitcoin.\n\nAkram Bekzada has lodged complaints with Australian regulators such as the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\n\nAll organisations told Mr Bekzada they were powerless to act.\n\n""To be honest, regulators should be ahead of this game rather than waiting to decide on who should be in charge of this after problems start erupting,"" he said.\n\nBarrister and bitcoin academic Dr Philippa Ryan agrees.\n\n""As always the law is really struggling to keep up with innovation. And that\'s not a new problem, it\'s just a bigger problem than ever.""\n\nUntil regulations are tightened, people like Mr Bekzada and Mr Champion could still be waiting for their money.\n\nTopics: internet-technology, computers-and-technology, science-and-technology, business-economics-and-finance, australia\n\nFirst posted', ""Mason Borda is a software engineer at BitGo, creator of GitMoney and the multi-signature Ethereum wallet Etherli.\n\nIn his free time, Mason enjoys fostering creativity and innovation in the Bitcoin space as the organizer of the 21 hackathons.\n\nIn 2010 the first Bitcoin purchase was made for two pizzas from Papa Johns. By 2011, it was possible to purchase Alpaca socks, and in 2012 VPN access.\n\nToday, I preordered a Tesla Model 3 for 2.413612 BTC.\n\nWhen I first read about Tesla Motors, it was in regards to the release of the Tesla Roadster in 2007 on Slate. I remember reading the statistics of the vehicle thinking, how is it possible for an electric vehicle to possibly have a 0–60 time that rivals that of the latest model Ferrari. The reality of such acceleration for an electric vehicle seemed illogical at the time. I was left equally skeptical and excited.\n\nThis revelation led me to join the electric vehicle engineering club in college, where I led a team to build a battery swapping station for commercial electric vehicles, and coordinated regular tours to Tesla Motors starting in 2010, where we got to ride in a Tesla Roadster.\n\nThe ride was better than I had imagined. It was very low to the ground, agile, and one of the fastest vehicles I had ridden in at the time. The acceleration glued me to the seat and propelled me down the highway at an eerily constant torque. I had to have one. Fast-forward to 2016, still just as big of a fan of new and emerging technologies, I have been entrenched in the world of bitcoin. Today, there are many applications coming online that enable consumers to buy everyday goods for bitcoin. So, I decided to perform the momentous act of preordering my Tesla Model 3 with bitcoin. The transaction\n\nMy weapon of choice was Shakepay, a new application which enables you to load up a one-time-use credit card for bitcoin. Using my homebrew SMS interface for my BitGo web wallet, I loaded up a card on Shakepay with bitcoin, and used the card to preorder a Tesla Model 3. The entire process took me 60 seconds once my card was loaded. There was no credit check involved, or a waiting period for the credit card to arrive in the mail – it just worked. As Steve Coast said, “The world will only get weirder”. How right he was. I just preordered an automobile that I have never seen or touched, which is propelled by electrons flowing through copper wires, that has a 0–60 of under four seconds and supposedly comes with no instrument cluster. I preordered this vehicle with an invisible currency that was invented by a pseudo-anonymous computer programmer who calls himself Satoshi Nakamoto and is likely not Japanese. I made this purchase using a service that dispenses ephemeral credit cards made by some Canadian guy that I met online named Jean, whom I met after placing a $400 bitcoin bounty for creating a Bitcoin payable API endpoint that could order and deliver me pizza upon payment.

We aim for high-probability trade setups on BTCUSD and use very few indicators. All charts use BNC’s Bitcoin Liquid Index for maximum accuracy.\n\nThe timeframe for trades is 1 to 7 days, so we’ll use 4h candlesticks. Bitcoin is best traded as a purely speculative commodity on 4h+ timeframes.\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\nThis section is based on internal (anonymized) Whaleclub trading data and is published exclusively on BNC.\n\nCurrent Active Long vs Short Volume Ratio: 2.5:1\n\nAverage Active Long vs Short Volume Ratio: 1.8:1\n\nWe have a 50% excess in active long volume relative to the average. The average weighted long entry price is $418.28, which is lower than the current market price - on average, active longs are in the green.\n\nSentiment is bullish, and the bears have again failed to make lower lows, with relatively little action or volatility in the bitcoin markets. Nobody is really sure why, but it looks like a storm is brewing. However, one thing is certain; once the market chooses a direction after this months-long consolidation, the trend it creates will be strong and long-lasting. And that time may come soon.\n\nMacro Key Points\n\nThis section is an overview of news headlines or events that may affect BTCUSD.\n\nOpenBazaar is open for business. This fully decentralized marketplace, powered by bitcoin, has the potential to change how we do commerce forever. Although the reception has been lukewarm, this just may be one of the killer bitcoin use cases everyone’s been looking for. It has gotten the community excited, and price action may follow.\n\nThe Panama Papers: 2.6 terabytes of Panama shell company leaks reveal massive networks of money laundering, tax evasion, and financial fraud tied to prominent world leaders. People who have assets to hide from pesky government hands may now think twice about funneling through offshore companies - bitcoin may prove a suitable alternative.\n\nThe bitcoin block reward halving is estimated to occur on July 12, 2016, about three months from now. The supply will halve - and assuming demand remains the same, the post-halving value per bitcoin is around $840. Extrapolating this based on the current market price, the present value of one bitcoin is around $210 - an attractive entry price.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\n4h+ Timeframe Setup\n\nThe BTCUSD market is still in its consolidation zone from last week. Our key daily support and resistance levels are left almost untouched. Daily support area is around $410 and daily resistance area is around $435.\n\nAs for trend lines, our squeezers and pennant from last week are still valid and will serve us well this week as price approaches upper resistance. We have both supporting and resisting levels in a triangle formation converging around the $430 level, with current lows at $400 and highs at $450.\n\nThis week we identify secondary trend lines (in bold green below) - we see that price has broken out above these in the past few days. This may be a prescient sign of an upcoming bullish breakout above our primary trend lines.\n\nAgain this week, price has not made lower lows (gold discs in chart below) as it consolidates. In general, the more price touches a trend line or support/resistance level, the stronger that level is. We see that price has touched our supporting trendline repeatedly without breaking down. It looks ready for a breakout.\n\nNow let’s switch to the 4h timeframe to dig a little deeper. Our daily trend lines and S/R levels are preserved.\n\nThe consolidation is clear. Price has been zig-zagging between the $410 and $425 levels for more than a month now. It should be noted that such a long and tight consolidation has only happened once or twice before in bitcoin’s history. This may be an indicator of lower long-term volatility, but we think price is just taking a rest and getting ready to break out, assisted by our supporting trend line and underlying bullish catalysts.\n\nBears have been failing to make lower lows over the past couple of months. Upper resistance around $425 is being tested heavily - this is usually a sign that a breakout is brewing. This pattern is known as an ascending triangle. Although past performance is not indicative of future performance, it has performed quite well historically as a leading indicator of bitcoin price action.\n\nNaturally the first breakout scenario we envision is bullish. To secure a trend, we expect price to break up above the previous swing high of $430. A pause in the pump can be expected as price makes its way to our medium-term target area of $445-$450.\n\nThe bearish scenario is described above. Price dumps to the consolidation support area before continuing on to reach swing low around $395. We deem this scenario unlikely to happen unless powered by a bearish news catalyst. The downside is limited.\n\nTrade Ideas\n\nThe highest probability scenario is the bullish setup described in the section above.\n\nFor additional confirmation, you can wait for a clear breakout above the $430 swing high, placing limit orders to buy $430 once that occurs, with $445 and $450 targets that you can use to ladder-exit (exit half your position at each price). For further confirmation, you can wait for price to retouch those resistance-turned-support levels before entering your buy orders.\n\nSentiment-wise, we do notice more longs this week, similarly to last week. This may indicate that professional players are slowly accumulating at these price levels as rookie longs close predominantly in the red. The macro-bias is still bullish, with the halving on the horizon and the limited downside favors those who go long. So we see going long now or at the $430 breakout as the highest probability trades.\n\nWe’d like to take a moment to thank you for reading the new Analysis Series on Brave New Coin.

The information presented in this post is an opinion and is not purported to be fact.', 'CoinTelegraph talks to Martin Schrimpff, Co-founder and Head of Global Sales of PayU. He is a big believer that Bitcoin can be a way to invest money. As currencies are changing dramatically around the world, it is a nice decentralized currency, completely out of any government control.\n\nMartin Schrimpff has founded 6 Tech companies with skills in the area of Business Development and strategic partnerships and experience in setting up operations in various latin American Countries like Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and Chile.\n\nWhat is PayU?\n\nPayU is a leading online payment service provider present in 16 high growth markets in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. It offers 250+ payment methods and more than 1,400 payment specialists, and at the moment they have 100,000+ merchants’ and millions of buyers.\n\nPayU see their strength in their local approach (valuing local language and culture). 90% of their revenues come from local transactions.\n\nMartin Schrimpff explains to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“We are specialising on the emerging markets, and we focus on those emerging markets. They are very exciting markets for us, and necessarily easy markets. We have gone to the local markets, we have 104 000 employees, out of which only 20 sit in our headquarters in Amsterdam, the rest is spread around the world. I\'m Colombian, our CEO is French. Our company is really international.”\n\nWhat they do is they provide services locally - credit cards and cash payments, ecommerce merchants. Recently, in last year and a half they have such rave payments and hot markets which are hard to get into. They service global merchants like Google, AirBnB, Booking.com, Sky, Facebook.\n\nServing these global merchants, PayU are enabling cross border payments. They are enabling merchants selling their products or services without necessarily having a legal entity in the local markets to penetrate these markets.\n\nSchirmpff says that people don\'t know much about PayU but as a global brand they are slowly getting to be known now.\n\nOur biggest competitor is cash\n\nPayU started as a company back in 2000-2001. And there has always been competition locally. However, their biggest competitor is cash.\n\nMartic Schrimpff says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Our biggest competitor is cash as a payment method. There are competitors locally, however there\'s no bigger player focusing on the market where we are focused. In that sense we are pretty unique. We partner with a lot of companies, so we don\'t even see them as our direct competitors.”\n\nUnderstanding local markets is the key\n\nPayU is “multi-local” and has people on the ground that tend to understand local markets. According to Schrimpff, if you have 250 payment options, they have connected to all of those payment options directly.\n\nSchrimpff explains:\n\n“When I see other players that claim that they have 300 payment options, I get a little skeptical, because they don\'t have those direct relationship like we do, cause we\'ve gone local, it has taken us 14 years and we really have something that other players just don\'t have in that sense. That gives us better pool rates, full control of the tools that we are able to use. We are in a better position to service all those global merchants.”\n\nThe future of B2B payment market\n\nCo-founder of PayU thinks that B2B payment market has been advancing quite a lot, and the future looks more and more bright for seamless payments. In his view, Uber was the first one to show how seamless payments can happen through the fact that you can just get out of the car without having to take out your wallet.\n\nSchrimpff clarifies:\n\n“I am a big believer in that. There is now Apple Pay, Samsung Pay - there is a lot evolving around seamless payments. As a B2B player we are continuously making sure that we are maximizing approval rates and payments for our B2B businesses.”\n\nThe big change that PayU is making, apart from concentrating more and more on merchant markets, is getting more into other FinTech spaces like credit, consumer credit, SMB credit. As Schrimpff mentioned before, their biggest challenge is cash.\n\nSchrimpff says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“For example, if we take Latin America, 50% of all payments are cash. We have got to alter the structure we have and give better payment solutions in those markets, that will take the whole structure to a new digital space of payments, and facilitate merchants to have more seamless transactions"".\n\nAt the moment 50% of these people buy something online, get out of the house, go and take cash, come back, and they are willing to do that. If PayU gives them the right solutions, like one-click buy, it will make things easier.\n\nBlockchain is an option but not the first thing to integrate\n\nPayU are currently investing in a few companies that are doing blockchain. They don’t want to be close-minded about it but they’d rather want to see what is going to happen.\n\nSchrimpff explains their position about blockchain:\n\n“I think it is still early days and it is too unclear. As I said before, at least on the Bitcoin side I am a big believer in it as a currency store value, comparing to gold. I still don\'t know if as a payment method it makes sense 100% or not. We have Bitcoin, BitPay now, and they come to us and they want to integrate into our platform, but no merchants are asking for this.”\n\nHowever, the players that have integrated it are seeing very little traction. So, Schrimpff suggests that it should not be one of PayU’s first moves to actually integrate it as a payment method into their system. They will start using it only if the merchants or the consumers ask for it.\n\nSchrimpff confirms:\n\n“If we see that happens, we will do it. Otherwise, it would seem like pushing something people are not really into. When merchants or consumers ask for this, is when they want to hide their identity. That is unfortunately why Bitcoin has been used for gambling purposes. We don\'t deal in gambling, we don\'t deal in a high-risk merchant markets, and we are not really being asked.”\n\nCo-founder of PayU says that he is a big believer that Bitcoin can be a way to invest money. As currencies are changing dramatically around the world, it is a nice decentralized currency, completely free of any government control, and he believes in that.', 'Bitcoins kaufen, Bitcoins verwahren?

Um Bitcoins zu empfangen besitzt jede Wallet einen Adress-Generator. Die Bitcoin-Adressen sind Transaktionsnummern, die zur Übertragung der Bitcoins dienen. Sie werden einmal für jede Transaktion genutzt, die Empfänger-Wallet speichert die Adressen und bietet damit einen Zugriff auf die für diese Adresse vermerkten Bitcoins – Bitcoins werden technisch nicht direkt im Wallet abgespeichert, sondern in einer zentralen Transaktionshistorie im Bitcoin-Netzwerk: Der sogenannten Blockchain.\n\nEine Wallet kann entweder client-seitig oder online betrieben werden. Online und bei einem fremden Anbieter ist das ein Risiko, denn bei einem fremden Zugriff auf den Server könnten Bitcoins entwendet werden. Bei einer Insolvenz des Anbieters gehen unter Umständen Wallets und Bitcoins verloren.\n\nFührt man eine Transaktion durch, wird der Wert sinngemäß von der bisherigen Adresse auf eine neue Bitcoin-Adresse bewegt, die alte Adresse enthält am Ende einer Transaktion normalerweise keine Bitcoins mehr – eventuell verbleibende Restbeträge werden vom Wallet auf eine neue Adresse, die sogenannte Change-Adresse, bewegt.\n\nBitcoin und Sicherheit\n\nHier sprechen wir von einfach und sicher. Die Verwendung dieser beiden Eigenschaftswörter ist eigentlich ein Widerspruch in sich, das gilt auch für Bitcoins:. Je sicherer der Nutzer die Anwendung und die Verwahrung von Bitcoins betreiben möchte, desto umständlicher ist die Bitcoin-Nutzung. Die größten Risiken sind:\n\n1. Ein Verlust der Wallet\n\nEine Möglichkeit seine Bitcoins zu verlieren, ist der Verlust der Wallet. Entweder, weil jemand sich Zugang dazu verschafft hat oder weil der Nutzer dass Passwort vergessen hat. Kein Passwort, keine Bitcoins – denn es gibt für Wallets keine „Passwort-Vergessen-Funktion“. Durch ein unsicheres Passwort das Wallet zu verlieren, wäre eine andere Möglichkeit – empfohlen ist daher ein Passwort mit einer Länge von mindestens 16 Zeichen. In diesem Bitcoin-Wiki werden weitere Hintergründe und Methoden zur Datensicherung bei Wallets tiefergehender erklärt.\n\nWie oben schon erwähnt, sind die Bitcoins ebenfalls verloren, sobald das Online-Wallet nicht mehr erreichbar ist.\n\n2. Ein Wertverlust durch Kursschwankungen\n\nBitcoins sind keine stabile Wertanlage, der Kurs der virtuellen Währung kann sich jederzeit drastisch verschlechtern. Also sollte nur ein Betrag in Bitcoins umgewandelt werden, der ohne Schmerzen verloren gehen könnte.\n\nAls Faustregel lässt sich festhalten: Bitcoins nicht online, sondern offline speichern. Immer so schnell wie möglich aus einer angreifbaren Online-Umgebung herausholen und in sicherere Umgebungen verlagern. Es gibt sehr aufwendige Methoden um Bitcoins zu speichern, zu anonymisieren und anzuwenden. Wir haben uns für einen Mittelweg aus Komfort und Sicherheit entschieden: Geringe Anonymität, gute Bedienbarkeit und vertretbare Sicherheit.\n\nAnzeige\n\nSo kaufst und lagerst du deine Bitcoins einfach und sicher\n\nWallet installieren: Bither\n\nFür unseren Test nutzen wir Bither, ein Bitcoin-Wallet, das auf deinem Smartphone installiert wird. Für Bither haben wir uns aus drei Gründen entschieden: Es ist als lokal auf deinem Handy installiertes „Offline-Wallet“ nutzbar, der offengelegte Quellcode ist hinlänglich bekannt und von der Community untersucht worden – und Bither ist sowohl für iOS als auch für Android verfügbar. Mehr Wallets und Hintergrundinfos zu den Wallets findet Ihr bei Bitcoin.org.\n\nWir entscheiden uns für einen „HD-Account“, der direkt auf dem Smartphone abgelegt wird. Später wird ein Backup vom Smartphone angelegt, dass die Wallet mitsichert. Betreiben werden wir das Wallet zusammen mit der Funktion „XRandom“, so erhalten wir für jede Transaktion eine neue „Kontonummer“ im Wallet angezeigt. Das verringert das Risiko der Kompromittierung.\n\nEin Passwort mit 20 Zeichen anhand einer Passwort-Phrase anlegen und die Einrichtung der Wallet ist abgeschlossen. Die „Wegwerf-Kontonummer“ für Einzahlungen zeigt Bither entweder direkt im Klartext an oder bietet einen QR-Code zum Abscannen. Ebenfalls als Phrase oder als QR-Code wird ein Sicherheitsmechanismus angeboten, mit dem die Wallet wiederhergestellt werden kann.\n\nDie Sicherheit von Bither lässt sich noch steigern mit dem „Hot- und Cold-Mode“. Ein Anwendungsbeispiel wäre die Nutzung von Bither auf dem iPhone im „Hot Mode“, auf dem iPad im „Cold Mode“. Bither im „Cold Mode“ lässt sich nur starten, wenn das Gerät keinerlei Netzwerkverbindung hat – Bitcoins können dann vom iPad-Wallet auf die iPhone-Wallet zur weiteren Verwendung übertragen werden. Für noch mehr Sicherheit wird ein Vault, ein Bitcoin-Tresor, benötigt.\n\nBitcoins sicher aufbewahren: Das Wallet „Bither“ bietet verlässlichen Speicherplatz. (Screenshot: Bither)\n\nVault einrichten: Xapo\n\nWir nutzen den Anbieter Xapo, der seinen „Cold Storage“ mit mehrere weltweit tätigen Versicherungen absichert. Bei Xapo erhalten wir gleichzeitig eine Online-Wallet, die benötigt wird, um Bitcoin-Einzahlungen temporär bei Xapo entgegen zu nehmen und dann in den Vault zu transferieren. Xapo beachtet, wie alle kommerziellen Anbieter, die aktuellen gesetzlichen Geldwäsche-Bestimmungen, diese sind auch bekannt unter dem Stichwort „Know-Your-Customer“. Deshalb müssen wir jetzt während der Registrierung online die Personalausweisdaten eingeben, samt Ausweisnummer und allen personenbezogenen Daten. Nach der Verifizierung von E-Mail-Adresse und Mobilfunknummer können wir Xapo sofort nutzen.\n\nNach Einrichtung und Verifizierung managed die Xapo App eine Wallet und den Vault – zweites und viertes Symbol unten. (Screenshot: Xapo)\n\nMarktplatz-Konto eröffnen: Bitcoin.de\n\nBitcoins kaufen: Bitcoin.de wickelt den An- und Vrkauf über die deutsche Fidor-Bank ab.(Screenshot: Bitcoin.de)\n\nAus Sicherheitsgründen entscheiden wir uns für Bitcoin.de, einen deutschen Marktplatz. Bitcoin.de arbeitet mit der Fidor-Bank zusammen, um den An- und Verkauf der Bitcoins abzuwickeln und ist rechtlich betrachtet ein „vertraglich gebundener Vermittler“ der Fidor Bank AG und muss sich an die Vorgaben des deutschen Kreditwesengesetz halten. Trotz der erhöhten rechtlichen Sicherheit für die Transaktion ist anzumerken, dass die bei Bitcoin.de gespeicherten Bitcoins nicht durch die Einlagensicherung der Fidor Bank abgesichert sind. Salopp gesagt: Geht Bitcoin.de pleite, sind die bei Bitcoin.de gespeicherten Bitcoins weg. Für uns kein Thema, wir transferieren die Bitcoins direkt nach dem Kauf in unser Wallet.\n\nBitcoin möchte während der Registrierung das Bankkonto und die Mobilfunkrufnummer verifizieren. Ist das geschehen, können sofort Bitcoins gekauft und verkauft werden. Allerdings nur bis zu einem jährlichen Gesamtwert von 2.500 Euro. Nach der vollständigen Legitimierung wird diese Beschränkung aufgehoben. Die Verifizierung des Bankkontos geschieht per Sofort-Überweisung, Nutzern mit einer Abneigung gegen diese Methode bietet der Kundendienst eine manuelle Verifizierungsmethode an. Alternativ kann auch ein kostenloses Girokonto der Fidor-Bank beantragt und genutzt werden. Das bietet den Vorteil, dass dieses Konto gleich für die vollständige Legitimierung genutzt werden kann. Alternativ kann ein Postident-Verfahren für 7,90 Euro durchgeführt werden.\n\nBilder (Screenshot: Bitcoin.de) 1 von 5\n\nBitcoins auf dem Marktplatz kaufen\n\nAuf Bitcoin.de wählen wir, vergleichbar mit dem Ablauf einer Transaktion auf eBay, ein Verkaufsangebot aus und erwerben Bitcoins. Verkäufer hinterlegen bei Bitcoin.de ihre Bitcoins zum Verkauf. Sobald ein Angebot eingestellt wurde, blockiert Bitcoin.de die entsprechenden Bitcoins auf dem Verkäuferkonto. Geht eine Kaufanfrage ein, bekommt der Käufer die direkte Bankverbindung des Verkaufers und überweist online. Sollten Probleme auftauchen, weil der Verkäufer die Bitcoins nicht freigibt, prüft Bitcoin.de den Kontoauszug und gibt die Bitcoins direkt frei. Einen Tag nach dem Kauf hat unser Verkäufer im Test die Bezahlung bestätigt und die Bitcoins wurden direkt dem Bitcoin.de-Online-Wallet gutgeschrieben.\n\nBilder (Screenshot: Bither) 1 von 6\n\nBitcoins vom Marktplatz in die Wallet übertragen\n\nJetzt überweise ich den bei Bitcoin.de erworbenen Betrag vom Bitcoin.de-Onlinewallet an mein Wallet auf meinem iPhone. Dazu klicke ich bei Bitcoin.de auf „Auszahlung“, gebe eine „Empfängeradresse“ meines Bither-Wallets an, löse die Transaktion mit dem Passwort meines Bitcoin.de-Onlinewallets aus und bestätige die Transaktion mit dem SMS-TAN, den mir Bitcoin.de zugesandt hat. Damit liegen die Bitcoins sicher auf meinem Smartphone.\n\nEine schnellere Alternative zu Bitcoin.de wäre Clevercoin aus den Niederlanden, die der dortigen gesetzlichen Aufsicht unterliegen und einen Echtzeit-Kauf per Kreditkarte anbieten. Wer lieber einen Account weniger haben möchte, kann auch bei Xapo Bitcoins erwerben – der Kauf erfolgt dort per SEPA-Überweisung an ein slowenisches Konto. Uns war für den Test die Variante auf „deutschem Boden“ am liebsten.\n\nJetzt besitzt du Bitcoins und kannst sie ausgeben.\n\nBitcoins vom Wallet in den Vault übertragen\n\nNach dem Login bei Xapo die „überzähligen“ Bitcoins, die in Sicherheit gebracht werden sollen vom Smartphone-Wallet Bither in das Online-Wallet bei Xapo senden. Dort mit einem Klick auf „Vault“ vom Wallet in den Tresor verlegen. Möchtest du die Bitcoins später aus dem Tresor holen, musst du bis zu 48 Stunden Geduld aufbringen – solange kann es dauern bis Xapo deine Bitcoins aus dem Tresor zurück in deine Wallet bewegt hat.\n\nBilder (Screenshot: Xapo) 1 von 5\n\nNoch ein wenig mehr Sicherheit: Bitcoin-Geldautomat und Paper-Wallet\n\nEine Stufe mehr Sicherheit beim Kaufen der Bitcoins bieten Dienste, die Bitcoins gegen Bargeld einwechseln. In Deutschland gibt es einige Bitcoin-Automaten, die Bargeld gegen Bitcoins tauschen. Beispielsweise hat das Bitcoin-Startup Pey einen solchen Bitcoin-Automaten in Hannover in Betrieb.\n\nStatt eines Vaults kann auch ein sogenanntes Paper-Wallet erzeugt werden, beispielsweise bei Bitadress.org, einem client-seitigen Walletgenerator. Jetzt werden die Bitcoins aus dem Online-Wallet an die erzeugte Adresse versandt, dann wird das Wallet ausgedruckt: Dabei werden vereinfach ausgedrückt die Bitcoins in Form einer Wallet-Adresse und einem Passwort, dem Private-Key für den Zugriff auf die Adresse ausgedruckt. Legst du dieses Papier in einen Banktresor oder bringst es sonstwie in Sicherheit, besitzt du quasi deinen eigenen „Vault“. Bitcoin-Nutzer mit extremen Sicherheitsbedürfnis nutzen den Bitadress-Generator offline auf ihrem Rechner, um eine Kompromittierung der Bitcoin-Adresse auszuschließen\n\nUm die Bitcoins auf dem Paper-Wallet zu nutzen, wird die Adresse wieder in ein Software-Wallet importiert. Bei der Nutzung einer Paper-Wallet, sollten Nutzer darauf achten, dass das Paper-Wallet nach einer Transaktion in der Regel keine Bitcoins mehr enthält. Wie Eingangs erklärt, transferiert die Software-Wallet nach eine Transaktion den Restbetrag auf eine neue Adresse. Möchte der Nutzer die Bitcoins wieder aus dem Software-Wallet entfernen, sollte jetzt ein neues Paper-Wallet generiert werden und die Bitcoins auf die neue Adresse des Paper-Wallets übertragen werden. Dass dann wieder sicher offline verwahrt wird.', 'Bitcoin, endlich richtig verständlich erklärt: Was ist eigentlich Bitcoin, wieso sind Bits und Bytes Geld wert – und wie funktioniert das eigentlich alles? Eine detaillierte Einführung in die Funktionsweise der Kryptowährung.\n\nIm April 1923 eine Tasse Kaffee zu bestellen, war eine riskante Angelegenheit. Betrug der Preis für das heiße Getränk bei der Bestellung noch vielleicht 6.000 Mark, konnte sich die Rechnung des Kellners schon auf 8.000 Mark belaufen. Arbeiter, die ihre Lohntüte erhielten, kauften Lebensmittel möglichst im Stechschritt für den ganzen Monat ein – oder noch weiter im Voraus, wenn das Geld reichte.\n\nEine Hyperinflation hielt Deutschland damals im Griff. Die Notenpressen der Reichsbank druckten bis zum Kriegsende zur Finanzierung des Krieges enorme Geldmengen, sie stieg von 13 Milliarden zu Kriegsanfang auf 60 Milliarden zu Kriegsende an, verbunden mit einem schrumpfenden Gütermarkt war das der Grundstein für die Entwicklung. Ein Trauma, das der deutschen Bevölkerung bis heute in den Knochen steckt – aber nicht nur der deutschen.\n\nLissabon 2015: Demonstranten der „Occupy-Bewegung“ überwinden eine Polizei-Barriere vor dem Parlament. (Foto: Luis Bras / Shutterstock.com)\n\nUnter dem Pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto postete 2008 ein Nutzer – oder eine Gruppe von Nutzern, es ist bis heute unklar wer Satoshi Nakamoto wirklich ist – ein Whitepaper in einer Mailingliste, das eine kryptografische Währung vorstellte. Nakamoto war der Meinung, dass die Geschichte des staatlich gestützten Geldes voll von Verrat am Vertrauen der Nutzer steckt – wie im Fall der deutschen Hyperinflation.\n\n„Das Kernproblem konventioneller Währungen ist das Ausmaß an Vertrauen, das nötig ist, damit sie funktionieren. Der Zentralbank muss vertraut werden, dass sie die Währung nicht entwertet, doch die Geschichte des Fiatgeldes ist voll von Verrat an diesem Vertrauen. Banken muss vertraut werden, dass sie unser Geld aufbewahren und es elektronisch transferieren, doch sie verleihen es in Wellen von Kreditblasen mit einem kleinen Bruchteil an Deckung. Wir müssen den Banken unsere Privatsphäre anvertrauen, vertrauen, dass sie Identitätsdieben nicht die Möglichkeit geben, unsere Konten leerzuräumen. Ihre massiven Zusatzkosten machen Micropayments unmöglich. Eine Generation früher hatten Nutzer von Time-Sharing-Computersystemen ein ähnliches Problem. Vor dem Aufkommen starker Verschlüsselung mussten die User sich auf den Passwortschutz für ihre Daten verlassen und dem Systemadministrator vertrauen, dass er ihre Informationen vertraulich hielt. Diese Privatsphäre konnte jederzeit aufgehoben werden, wenn der Administrator zu dem Schluss kam, dass sie weniger wog als andere Belange, oder auf Anweisung seiner Vorgesetzten. Dann aber wurde starke Verschlüsselung für die Masse der Nutzer verfügbar, und Vertrauen war nicht länger nötig. Daten konnten auf eine Weise gesichert werden, die einen Zugriff durch Dritte – egal aus welchem Grund, egal mit wie guten Entschuldigungen, egal was sonst – unmöglich machten. Es ist Zeit, dass wir dasselbe mit Geld machen. Mit einer elektronischen Währung, die auf einem kryptografischen Beweis beruht und kein Vertrauen in Mittelsmänner benötigt, ist Geld sicher und kann mühelos transferiert werden.“ Satoshi Nakamoto, 11.

04/11/2016,"['It’s no secret that Bitcoin is in a little bit of trouble. Its value is well below its 2014 high, and fewer people are predicting that the cryptocurrency will lead to the overthrow of conventional money. That being said, a new WebGL visualizer called BitBonkers demonstrates that people are still using the currency and sometimes in alarmingly large amounts. It’s pretty clear no one is spending $100,000 in Bitcoins on a new car, if you catch what we’re saying.\n\nThe visualizer represents each Bitcoin transaction as a metallic ball, scaled to the size of the transaction. The balls drop onto a table, allowing you to click on them to gauge their actual size. The table usually fills up with a mess of smaller 1-10 BTC balls before being sent into disarray by a big blue 100-1000 BTC orb. With a single Bitcoin at a current USD value of $421, those larger orbs represent pretty substantial transactions. And they aren’t rare, you’ll probably see at least ten a minute, and they aren’t even the smallest size in the visualizer.\n\nThe algorithm that runs the visualizer works by searching the end of the blockchain that keeps the confidential tally of transactions. “The cubes represent the last block from the blockchain, which are mined on average every ten minutes, the size of the block is determined by its size in kilobytes,” the site reads.\n\nIt’s striking to see all of the transactions flow across the screen, and the designer has done a great job of creating an attractive interface. It also shows that Bitcoin is not a normal currency, because sometimes it seems like almost a majority of transactions are for values of at least $5,000, and many are for much more. In fairness, the relative difficulty of Bitcoin transactions may preclude smaller transfers, but it’s hard to imagine any legal reason for the massive, anonymous spending.\n\nIt’s one thing to collect Bitcoin hoping its value will rise over the next few months or years. It’s another to make relatively routine trades with values of tens of thousands of dollars. After all, with all the risks and difficulties associated with Bitcoin trading, it’s no secret we’re talking about a less reputable base of users.\n\nThe currency, nevertheless, still holds promise, and this visualizer will be a great way to see how it continues to evolve. It’s quickly addicting to watch all that money pass before your eyes. Before long, you just want to reach out and grab some for yourself.', 'Four months have passed since the world learned the name of Craig Wright, a man who, as WIRED wrote in December, either created Bitcoin or very badly wants someone to believe he did.\n\nNow rumors are swirling through the Bitcoin world that Wright himself is poised to publicly claim—and possibly offer some sort of proof—that he really is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of Bitcoin. If he does, he’ll have to convince a highly skeptical cryptography community for whom “proof” is a serious word, and one that requires cryptographic levels of certainty.\n\nThe suggestion is that Wright, an Australian cryptographer and security professional, has arranged to perform a demonstration for media in London sometime in the next week that’s intended to convince the world he’s bitcoin’s creator.1 Luckily for any legitimate claimant to the Satoshi throne—and for bitcoiners tired of the long succession of unproven candidates and speculation—there are some clear, almost incontrovertible ways for Satoshi Nakamoto to prove himself. When WIRED asked bitcoiners and cryptographers what it would take to convince them that Craig Wright is that long-lost Bitcoin founding father, they suggested a variety of methods, each with its own level of certainty. But there\'s one form of proof that would be considered airtight for all but the most skeptical skeptics: what Johns Hopkins cryptographer Matthew Green describes as ""show me the money.""\n\nIf Wright created Bitcoin, he should have access to the keys that control the earliest bitcoins mined on his computer or computers. Those coins have never moved in bitcoin\'s seven-year history, despite at times being worth as much as a billion dollars based on Bitcoin\'s exchange rate. (They\'re valued today at closer to $400 million.) And that hoard of cryptographic treasure, held in a series of bitcoin addresses that each contains 50 bitcoins, are controlled by a collection of private keys—secret strings of characters—that in theory only Nakamoto possesses. If Wright can prove possession of the keys by moving some portion of those oldest bitcoins to a different address, Green says he\'d be convinced. ""It would be unmistakable,"" says Green. ""You’d see big piles of old money moving around. That\'s the cryptographic miracle I want to see.""\n\nYou’d see big piles of old money moving around. That\'s the cryptographic miracle I want to see. Cryptographer Matthew Green\n\nThat still wouldn\'t necessarily be enough proof, however, for Jerry Brito, director of the cryptocurrency research group Coin Center. Brito points out that Nakamoto ought to possess one key that\'s associated with Bitcoin\'s so-called Genesis Block, the beginning of the public ledger of bitcoin transactions called the Blockchain. As a quirk of Bitcoin\'s design, those first Genesis Block bitcoins can\'t be moved or spent, but the key associated with them could be used to sign a message. So, Wright\'s strongest proof would be to not only sign a message with that key, Brito says, but to sign messages with the keys from dozens of the first bitcoin blocks until no doubt remains. If Wright proved possession of one or two early blocks of bitcoins but not the Genesis Block or a broad collection of unmoved early coins, Brito says he\'d still have suspicions; perhaps Wright started mining in secret very early, for instance, which could also explain his control of an early key. ""If you only have the key to, say, the sixth block, why is that the only key he has?"" Brito says. ""If you’re Satoshi you should be able to sign and also moves funds from a lot of the early blocks.""\n\nAnd there\'s yet another key that Wright might use to try to prove his bitcoin claim: a PGP key long believed to be controlled by Nakamoto and attributed to him on the PGP key server run by MIT. While one blog post written by Craig Wright included a PGP public key that, when checked against the MIT server, was associated with the email address satoshin@vistomail.com, that\'s not the same, older key, which is associated with the slightly different address satoshi@vistomail.com. But Brito points out that Nakamoto\'s PGP has never actually been publicly used to sign anything, making it hard to definitively prove that it\'s actually his. And he adds that, of course, any key could have been stolen from a hacked computer or somehow shared by the real Satoshi Nakamoto with associates.\n\nGavin Andresen, one of the few people in the world who\'s corresponded by email with Satoshi Nakamoto before the bitcoin founder ghosted from the internet in 2011, has his own list of criteria for Wright to prove himself, which he first shared with the Financial Times, and it\'s long. He wants messages signed with both Nakamoto\'s PGP key and keys from early bitcoin blocks, private messages he sent to Andresen alone, and an emailed correspondence with Wright to get a feel for whether he\'s the same person Andresen communicated with in Bitcoin\'s early days. ""It\'d take multiple lines of evidence to convince me,"" Andresen wrote in an email to WIRED.\n\nIf bitcoiners like Andresen and Brito are setting a high bar for Wright, it\'s because serious holes have already been poked in his resumé. Wright first came to WIRED\'s attention through a large collection of leaked emails, meeting transcripts and accounting documents, as well as old posts from his blog that seemed to strongly suggest he\'d created bitcoin. But WIRED also found that some of those blog posts had been backdated, either as part of a hoax or as a sign that Bitcoin\'s creator was ready to take credit for his work. After both WIRED and Gizmodo published our findings on Wright\'s background, other inconsistencies appeared, including the fact that two PhDs Wright claimed to have received from Charles Sturt University in Australia don\'t appear to exist, nor do a pair of supercomputers Wright claimed to own and even managed to get listed in the Top500 list of the world\'s most powerful supercomputers.\n\n""This man has a big credibility gap to overcome,"" Brito says. ""I’m open to being convinced he’s Satoshi. But there\'s a lot of evidence in the not-Satoshi column.""\n\nBrito also points out that the real Satoshi Nakamoto has sought privacy above fame for the last seven years, and that Wright\'s anticipated show of proving his Bitcoin creation to media seems out of character for his attention-averse, would-be pseudonym. It\'s possible that another reason for Wright\'s demonstration is that he\'s being extorted by a hacker who has his files, a claim his friend, cryptographer Ian Grigg, has made. In theory, he may now be trying to defang that extortion threat by outing himself.\n\nProving that he\'s the one true creator of Bitcoin may be the least of Wright\'s problems. Shortly after WIRED\'s and Gizmodo\'s initial stories were published, his home near Melbourne was raided by the Australian Federal Police working on behalf of the Australian Tax Authority. Australian officials declined to comment to WIRED at the time, but officials later told an Australian newspaper that they believe Wright ""is not the creator of Bitcoin and that he may have created the hoax to distract from his tax issues.""\n\nWith all that room for reasonable suspicion, it\'s no wonder that skeptics are hesitant to believe that Wright is Bitcoin\'s founding father. Even if he does perform the ""cryptographic miracle"" of moving Satoshi\'s oldest bitcoins or signing a message with the Genesis Block key, some doubters will almost certainly argue that Wright somehow stole or hacked the keys from the cryptocurrency\'s true inventor. But for those with an open mind, moving a few chunks of the so-called ""bitcoin billion"" should be proof enough, says Dan Kaminsky, a well-known security researcher with a history of bitcoin analysis. Even the theory that Wright might have somehow hacked Nakamoto\'s computer hardly discounts that proof, Kaminsky argues. ""Every computer can be hacked. But if he hacked Satoshi, then this guy knew who the real Satoshi was, and that\'s more than what the rest of us can say,"" Kaminsky points out. ""If Wright does a transaction with one of these keys, he’s done something no other wannabe-Satoshi has done, and we should recognize that.""\n\n1Corrected 4/11/2016 2:23pm EST to state that Wright\'s demonstration is expected to occur this week, not next.', 'Jake Sturmer reported this story on Monday, April 11, 2016 18:05:28\n\nMARK COLVIN: A global bitcoin exchange operating in Australia appears to be on the verge of collapse.\n\n\n\nIgot, as the company\'s called, has hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debts which it can\'t pay.\n\n\n\nDozens of customers have been waiting in some cases six months and counting to get their money back.\n\n\n\nA bit like a foreign currency exchange, Igot was supposed to take your money and turn it into the computer currency bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that some customers haven\'t been able to get all their money or bitcoins back from the company.\n\n\n\nNational technology reporter Jake Sturmer has the story.\n\n\n\nJAKE STURMER: Bitcoin is supposed to be the new digital global currency that\'s virtually fee-free to transfer with the value sent to your computer\'s wallet almost instantly.\n\n\n\nYou can use the computer currency to buy items online, with major companies like Microsoft now accepting them.\n\n\n\nTo get bitcoins, the easiest way is to go through a bitcoin exchange, buying bitcoins like you would US dollars.\n\n\n\nBut for dozens of the users of the Australian-founded Igot exchange, the process has been anything but instant. And the frustration of trying to get the money or bitcoins back is mounting.\n\n\n\nAKRAM BEKZADA: What I\'ve got left in there is in the vicinity of $15,000, and I\'ve been waiting on it since October 26, 2015.\n\n\n\nJAKE STURMER: That\'s Akram Bekzada; one of the several customers the ABC has spoken to who are waiting to get their money back.\n\n\n\nAKRAM BEKZADA: It usually starts with 10 business days. They start telling you, ""Oh, it\'s coming soon, don\'t worry,"" and then he\'d start giving you more promises.\n\n\n\nJAKE STURMER: Igot was founded in Australia in 2013 by Indian-born entrepreneur Rick Day. Shortly after, he moved to New York to expand the business.\n\n\n\nThat\'s where he met US entrepreneur Jesse Chenard who came on board as an advisor to the company, lured by the excitement of the emerging technology of bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThe ABC has spoken to Mr Chenard who says he heard alarm bells once he dug deeper into the company\'s finances in 2014.\n\n\n\nJESSE CHENARD: I think at that time it was insolvent but because he claimed to have other assets and because everything was murky and in his name and what have you, he claimed that he was able to cover it and that it was a small, you know, accounting thing. So I would say that the balance sheet looked pretty crappy.\n\n\n\nJAKE STURMER: That\'s a claim Rick Day denies.\n\n\n\nJesse Chenard never invested in Igot and went on to start his own business involved in the technology that underpins bitcoin.\n\n\n\nRick Day, now living in Mumbai, told the ABC in a phone interview they had a falling out because he wouldn\'t give Jesse Chenard enough equity in the company.\n\n\n\nBecause of the phone line quality, we have had to revoice parts of this interview.\n\n\n\n(excerpt from interview with Rick Day)\n\n\n\nRICK DAY (voiceover): He sat us down and he saw our systems worked and then he went and started his own thing. So as far as Jesse Chenard is concerned, I am making no further comment.\n\n\n\nJAKE STURMER: Rick Day told the ABC that there had been problems, but maintained the company was solvent and everybody would get their money back.\n\n\n\nHe put the problems down to bank delays, system errors and attempts by hackers to clog up his network.\n\n\n\nRICK DAY (voiceover): I know you\'re concerned about the customers. We are a start-up, we are not some Ponzi scheme start-up for some company that just takes money and runs away. Who would do that and why would I do that?\n\n\n\nJAKE STURMER: Akram Bekzada is still waiting for his money though Igot\'s system declared the transaction complete weeks ago.\n\n\n\nDespite asking for help from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission), Akram Bekzada has been told there\'s little that regulators can do.\n\n\n\nAKRAM BEKZADA: They should really be ahead of their game. I mean bitcoin is now traded in billions of dollars, so a currency or a kind of trade this big should gain more public attention and draw proper regulations in order to secure peoples\' assets and hard-earned money.\n\n\n\nJAKE STURMER: Dr Philippa Ryan, who\'s a barrister and a bitcoin academic, believes that while regulators are trying to work out the best way to deal with the computer currency, exchanges should set up a code of conduct.\n\n\n\nPHILIPPA RYAN: As always, the law is really struggling to keep up with innovation. And that\'s not a new problem; it\'s just a bigger problem than ever.\n\n\n\nMARK COLVIN: Bitcoin academic Dr Philippa Ryan ending Jake Sturmer\'s report.', 'In my previous article \'Inflation: The Beast in the Cage\' we discussed how central banks are purposefully manufacturing inflation in the hopes of countering the global economy\'s prevailing deflationary headwinds, and the ramifications this could have for fiat currencies (currencies issued and backed by central banks).\n\nWhile there is some evidence QE and easing monetary policies have helped spur growth, there is also increasing cause for concern that the continuation of these policies will do more harm than good. Already, these policies have largely acted as a \'reverse wealth redistribution\' that has increased wealth inequality while also compromising central bankers\' credibility. This standoff of central banks vs deflation can only end in one of two ways: central banks eventually admit defeat to deflation- or the markets force them to by questioning their credibility to make an impact- or central bankers successfully create inflationary conditions.\n\nThe possibility of either outcome has driven some investors to look for alternatives to the paper currencies backed by these central banks. Traditionally this alternative option has been gold, but in this article we\'ll look further at why this is, and also discuss the investment viability of a potentially revolutionary newcomer to the \'alternative to paper currency\' and \'storage of value\' scene Bitcoin. There are a growing number of Bitcoin related ETFs and investment vehicles that investors in gold and Bitcoin alike should be aware of, including ARKW, OTCQX:GBTC and (most notably) COIN.\n\nWhy Gold?\n\nTo understand the value of gold as an alternative to paper currency, one must first understand what currency is (and isn\'t). A currency has the following characteristics:\n\nIt serves as medium of exchange and account The function of currency is to facilitate economic exchanges. A farmer looking to sell one of his cows to the blacksmith in return for horseshoes has a problem if he doesn\'t need the exact number of horseshoes the cow is worth. Currency- by being easily divisible and neutral of value with respect to the parties in the transaction (unlike barter where value of payment is directly impacted by each parties preferences)- allows for easier and more efficient exchanges. Of course for this to hold true a currency must have wide acceptance and availability (otherwise it would no longer serve to make exchanges easier). It must act as a \'storage of value\' A currency must have a fixed or controlled level of supply that contributes to a consistent value. If there were unlimited amounts available to everyone at any given time, obviously a currency would become worthless, but a limited supply alone is not enough, it must also be relatively stable. Otherwise, if amounts of currency available fluctuated wildly from day to day, and thus- all else equal- its value would significantly fluctuate. To return to our example, in such a case the farmer would be less willing to sell his cow for money because if the value of that money fluctuated wildly, when he most needed to buy hay to feed his animals that money might not buy what he needs- it would be safer and preferable to him to keep his wealth in the form of something with a more stable and known value, such as his cow. Without a value that is easily protected and relatively stable over time, the usefulness of a currency quickly breaks down, and when it no longer serves its purpose it is abandoned, like former currencies which have become obsolete and extinct due to hyperinflation.\n\nBoth conditions must be met to be a currency: things which generally hold their values but are not commonly used to facilitate transactions (homes or collectibles for instance) have the same basic issues as our rudimentary example: their values are highly dependent on the specific parties in the transaction. Likewise, things which are used for transactions but which do not store value- like a formerly stable currency now undergoing hyperinflation- quickly lose any practical function and usefulness as a currency. These criteria are why precious metals such as gold and silver were among the first forms of currency ever; gold is divisible but uniform in its properties from piece to piece, widely accepted, relatively scarce, and non-perishable.\n\nToday, gold as a holding can be thought of in two ways: 1) as an industrial commodity and 2) as a currency. Often people refer to gold as a commodity even when the aspects of gold they have in mind have more to do with its functions as a currency.\n\nWhile gold has an industrial purpose that drives a portion of its value (just like other commodities: crude oil, iron, coal etc), evidence suggests that in many ways it is more appropriate to think of gold primarily as a currency. Like a currency, some government banks may pay interest on gold deposits, gold can be lent to borrow USD for more favorable or even net negative borrow rates (akin to a FX swap or forward), and spot gold literally trades as a currency exchange rate in the OTC Forex markets just like EURUSD or USDJPY trade. But perhaps the best indication that gold is unique amongst commodities and behaves fundamentally differently is how it has behaved vs other industrial commodities in the last ten years.\n\nGold Price in US Dollars data by YCharts\n\nThough there is no \'intrinsic value\' to gold as a non-commodity (at least no more than there is to the cotton fibers of a freshly minted Benjamin), gold derives a non-commodity value from its acceptance and function as a currency like the Euro, Yen, Yuan or Dollar. Gold is universally valued, divisible, fungible, scarce, securable, and non-perishable. Yet, unlike paper currency, gold\'s supply is governed by factors other outside the realm of central bank monetary policy, in fact it has been used as a currency for thousands of years before central banks even existed. And this is exactly why investors turn to gold when concerned about inflation, weakness in \'paper\' currencies, or central bank credibility- it acts as an alternative \'storage of value\' and has served in this capacity for quite some time.\n\nBitcoin vs Gold: Does Bitcoin Offer the Same Benefits?\n\nLike gold, Bitcoin is divisible, universally consistent from one unit to another (fungible), and fixed in its available supply, with the rate of growth of the supply controlled by forces other than central bank policy. But can it provide investors the same potential benefits as gold? To answer that, we need to critically examine whether Bitcoin is actually a new form of currency, or something else entirely.\n\nCriteria #1: Does Bitcoin serve as a medium of exchange?\n\nThe short answer is yes, to a sizeable and growing number of businesses and marketplace participants Bitcoin is an accepted or even preferred form of payment and exchange. Currently, an estimated 120-150 thousand businesses accept Bitcoins, including companies as large as Dell, DISH, Expedia, Overstock.com, and even nonprofits such as the Red Cross.\n\nIn line, with this growth in companies which accept Bitcoin, both the number of transactions per day, and the total dollar amount of those transactions, have steadily grown, even as Bitcoin prices themselves have fallen from all-time highs.\n\nThe total number of daily transactions (transactions, not trades on exchanges) in Bitcoin has steadily been on the rise and today measures in the several hundred thousand.\n\nBitpay\'s total dollar amount of transactions have continue to steadily grow despite falling prices.\n\nGiven the wide rate of Bitcoin\'s usage for conducting transactions, and the rampant rate of growth of that usage, it seems fair to say that Bitcoin does serve as a medium of exchange.\n\nCriteria #2: Does Bitcoin act as a storage of value?\n\nAnswering this second question is a bit (no pun intended) more difficult and subjective. Compared to gold and paper currencies, Bitcoin has a very short history which makes it difficult if not impossible to answer whether Bitcoin can act as a long-term storage of value. Remember, gold has been used as a currency for several thousand years while Bitcoin has existed for less than a decade.\n\nBitcoin does however posses some of the prerequisites necessary for something to act as a storage of value:\n\nBitcoin has a fixed total supply\n\nBitcoin has a steady rate of growth in the supply that does not lead to wild fluctuations in the total supply\n\nBitcoin transactions are virtually impossible to counterfeit\n\nTogether these factors mean that the supply of Bitcoins should be stable, which should allow it to potentially act as a storage of value. Yet while these conditions are necessary to act as a storage of value, they are not wholly sufficient. Just because something has a stable supply does not mean it is valuable, value requires there to also be demand.\n\nThere is reasonable evidence to support the argument that Bitcoin demand exists, is relatively stable, and is gradually on the rise as Bitcoin is adopted on a broader scale for conducting transactions (discussed in Criteria #1 above), but this answer is still a bit too qualitative for my taste.\n\nOne way we can begin to more objectively answer the question of whether Bitcoin acts as a storage of value is to look at the what the hard data tells us about Bitcoin\'s volatility compared to that of other currencies. Something that acts a storage of value should have a relatively low volatility- it should remain roughly the same value from day to day and any changes over longer periods of time should be gradual. Thus, by comparing the volatilities of various USD currency pairs, we can begin to see where Bitcoin stacks up.\n\nThe above chart displays the rolling historical 30 day volatilities of the Euro, Yen, Aussie dollar (aka the \'dollarydoo\'), gold and Bitcoin. As might be expected, historically Bitcoin\'s volatility has been vastly higher than these well established forms of currency, but there are some notable trends. First, Bitcoin volatility appears to be steadily on the decline, meaning that in relative terms it is gradually becoming more of a \'storage of value.\' Secondly, and perhaps even more interesting, is that just recently, for the first time in history, the historical 30 day volatility of Bitcoin has dropped below that of gold. One shouldn\'t rush to make too much of this, but it is a small indication that Bitcoin may in fact have begun to serve in a similar capacity as gold for some investors, in regards to gold\'s role as a non-paper currency storage of value.\n\nBut does that mean Bitcoin is a currency? There is no single answer, but personally, I would tend to say yes. It is used as a medium of exchange by a large and growing number of companies and individuals alike, and using volatility as a proxy for indicating its usage as a storage of value, it seems Bitcoin is rapidly becoming comparable to other currencies. Of course, the major caveat is that Bitcoin\'s entire history only spans a handful of years, but given that trends indicate a continued growth in usage, and a continued wariness about paper currencies from investors, there are some arguments to be made that investors may be rewarded for the additional risks associated with Bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, though it is not without its own distinct problems, Bitcoin does have some areas of advantage over gold. Compared to physical gold, Bitcoin is much easier (at least for tech savvy investors) to purchase and store, with much lower transaction costs for Bitcoin compared to retail players in physical gold (more on that later). Also, since it is electronic by nature, Bitcoin is much easier, faster and simpler to use in everyday purchases and transactions than physical gold. And by some measures, Bitcoin may be significantly undervalued relative to gold.\n\nFor example, there are estimated to have been about 6 billion ounces of gold ever mined. At $1,200 an ounce, that means worldwide supplies of gold represent a $7.2 trillion USD value. If we think of those $7.2 trillion roughly as the worldwide demand for non-paper currency, even if we hold it constant and assume Bitcoin is only 1% of this demand, given the current level of about 15.5 million Bitcoins in existence right now, each one would be worth about $4,600 vs their current price around $400.\n\nObviously this is just a thought experiment and far from the only way to value Bitcoins, but if Bitcoin does become a popular option as an alternative storage of value, comparing it to gold to determine a relative price is a reasonable place to start. Readers should note that I am in no way advocating Bitcoin (or any investment) as right for everyone, or saying that Bitcoin ever should or will replace investors\' gold holdings. However, given the evidence, some investors may find that allocating a portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin is an attractive option for much the same reasons they find would invest in gold.\n\nAnd while actually buying Bitcoins may sound intimidating to retail investors, with recent improvements to trading exchanges and marketplaces, retail investors have a growing number of relatively low cost options.\n\nThe Bitcoin Marketplace: Price Transparency, Liquidity and Security\n\nLike the Forex markets and the physical gold markets, the marketplace for Bitcoin is fragmented and OTC (over the counter). Though numerous marketplaces and exchanges for Bitcoin exist, they are disjointed. A central, aggregated source of pricing and liquidity- such as exists for stocks and futures- simply does not exist for Bitcoin, which means at any given time, any two willing parties can agree to buy/sell Bitcoins at any given price, regardless of the prices predominantly being traded elsewhere.\n\nPrice transparency, and liquidity, are improving though, with more aggregated sources of information becoming available and the recent launch of Gemini, the first non-tech savvy, retail investor friendly Bitcoin exchange with USD deposits actually FDIC insured.\n\nThe above depicts the price of Bitcoin on various exchanges, helping to better pinpoint the fair value of Bitcoins at any given time.\n\nThough daily USD volumes traded in Bitcoin are still quite small, at under $10 million per day USD activity they are less than 1% of daily activity in the popular gold related ETF GLD, transactions costs are quite low compared to physical gold markets for retail investors. With Bitcoin bid offer spreads of just $.01, and the ~25 bps (.25%) fees/commissions charged by many exchanges on trades, investors can expect to pay round trip bid-offer spreads of about .505%, or about $2.13 per Bitcoin at current prices. This is anywhere from 3-10x cheaper than the enourmous big-offer spreads retail investors pay in the physical gold markets.\n\nAnother (significant) issue in the spot Bitcoin market is security, which has especially been on investors minds since the Mt. Gox fiasco. Though no form of Bitcoin (or gold) will ever be entirely riskless to hold, with additional exchanges such as Gemini forming in US jurisdictions, and in cooperation with existing financial regulations and consumer protections, risks in Bitcoin are considerably less than the wild west days of Mt. Gox. With increasingly sophisticated biometric verfiication and encryption security protocols offered by leading Bitcoin exchanges and wallets, investors who take the proper steps can virtually eradicate the risk of malicious attackers stealing their Bitcoins (cracking even a \'simplistic\' 128-bit encryption key ""would still take billions of years to brute force on current and foreseeable hardware."")\n\nA Practical Look at Bitcoin Exposure: Related Investment Vehicles\n\nWhile a number of Bitcoin related ETFs currently exist for investors who are looking for exposure, and there will likely be more to come, unfortunately those options leave much to be desired. Unlike gold and many other currencies, for which ETFs exist that have historically very closely tracked the spot currency (ex. GLD, UUP and FXE) the currents options for Bitcoin do not track well to Bitcoin spot prices.\n\nOne recently launched ETF in the Bitcoin space is the formidably named \'ARK Web x.0 ETF\' . Unfortunately, the ETF is not a pure play on Bitcoin, and invests in what it calls \'disruptive technologies.\' It\'s top three holding are currently Athenahealth, Netflix and Amazon, and the portion of the fund that is attributed to Bitcoin does not hold Bitcoins directly, but shares of the \'Bitcoin Investment Trust\' .\n\nSadly, investors looking to cut out the middle man and directly use GBTC to invest in Bitcoins are also likely to be disappointed. Not only does GBTC charge an outrageous 2% fee (extremely high for a passive index fund and 5x times that of GLD\'s), but even putting the fee aside, GBTC does a poor job of tracking spot Bitcoin prices. This is because unlike other currency ETFs, GBTC has poor mechanisms in place to ensure Authorized Participants can create/redeem shares in a timely manner in order to keep GBTC share prices tied to the price of Bitcoin. This process typically allows Authorized Participants to arbitrage away small price discrepancies as they occur, as occurs for GLD, but unlike the immense physical gold markets, large pools of physical Bitcoin liquidity may not be readily available for would be arbitrages to complete the process.\n\nThus, GBTC regularly exhibits massive premiums to its NAV of 20-30%, and premiums have been known to even be upwards of 100%, making it an extremely ill-advised method of getting exposure to Bitcoins.\n\nFinally, despite being the most widely discussed ETF linked to Bitcoin\'s, the Winklevoss\' COIN has been held up for several years by regulators. The launch of the twins\' Bitcoin exchange, Gemini, may be a sign that this reluctance and red tape is on the decline, but for now COIN remains stuck in the works. Once (or if) it does begin trading, investors would be wise to learn from the examples of ARKW and GBTC, and carefully examine the design of the fund and the mechanisms it has in place to minimize tracking error.\n\nConclusion\n\nThough not without risks, Bitcoin offers many of the same potential benefits to investors as gold, while potentially being significantly undervalued due to being less understood and widely accepted. Unfortunately however, at this time there does not exist an excellent option for investors looking for Bitcoin exposure without trading spot Bitcoins directly, and investors should be aware of the high costs and problems such the ETFs that do exist.\n\nThanks for reading. Please follow for more coverage of alternative investments and macroeconomics, and please share your thoughts about Bitcoin and its viability as an investment and currency in the comments.', 'Jim Rickards, the New York Times best-selling author of Currency Wars and The Death of Money, recently discussed his latest book, The New Case for Gold, during a reinvent.money hangout. Although the majority of the conversation focused on Rickards’ new book, the economic commentator also shared some thoughts on Bitcoin.\n\nAnything Can Be Money\n\nIn recent interviews, Rickards has mentioned Bitcoin as a legitimate form of money and said on the reinvent.money hangout that, in fact, anything can be money.\n\nHe stated:\n\n“At various times in history, feathers have been money, shells have been money, dollars and euros are money, Bitcoin is money, gold is money, and silver is money. There are many different kinds of money.”\n\nRickards also took issue with the idea that some forms of money, such as Bitcoin or U.S. dollars, are not backed by anything.\n\n“But that’s not true,” he said. “They are backed by one thing, which is confidence. If you and I have confidence that something is money and we agree that it’s money, then it can be money.”\n\nAlthough Rickards believes anything can be money, he went on to describe how some forms of money are better than others (in the eyes of the market.)\n\nThe Viability of a Money is Determined by the Market\n\nRickards explained that the viability of any form of money is determined by the people who use it (or don’t use it). He stated, “The question is: Will anyone have confidence in it? Same thing with Bitcoin; same thing with gold.”\n\nRickards then added, “I can call something money, but if nobody else in the world wants it, then it’s not very useful as money.”\n\nAs Rickards explained, people can decide to use anything as money. Having said that, there are still properties of some assets that make them more useful as money than others. Attributes such as portability, divisibility, fungibility and others are often pointed to as properties of good money.\n\nGovernments Have an Advantage with Their Money\n\nOne of Rickards’ key points is that governments hold a major advantage over free market alternatives.\n\n“Governments have an edge because they can make you pay taxes in their money,” he said.\n\nPut another way, governments essentially create an artificial use case for their own forms of paper money by threatening people with punishment if they do not pay taxes, which are denominated in the government’s own fiat currency, to the government.\n\nAlthough governments benefit from this advantage, it hasn’t stopped many forms of government money from facing a loss in confidence over the years. Specifically, Rickards point out the Weimar Republic (Germany), Zimbabwe, Argentina and present-day Venezuela as examples of fiat currency crises.\n\nRickards Still Prefers Gold\n\nRickards has had some kind things to say about Bitcoin recently, but he’s still not convinced it’s a better alternative to gold. He pointed out in the interview one of his main issues with digital currencies:\n\n“Bitcoin is digital. If the power grid goes down, your bitcoins are worthless. I’m not anti-Bitcoin ... but physical gold does not have the disabilities of Bitcoin and digital currencies like the [U.S.] dollar.”\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The Clean India Mission has announced some interesting tidbits of information, including rewarding recyclable waste item deposits with a digital value token. But there is a twist, as users would not need a mobile device to receive these tokens, as they can be printed out and exchanged for clean drinking water.\n\nAlso read: ASIC and Singapore Collaborate on Fintech and Bitcoin Regulation\n\nBitcoin-like Trest Token to Support Clean India Mission\n\nAccording to a report by TopTenFindings, India is the 9th dirtiest country in the world, a reason why the it’s elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a public campaign to the tackle this issue.\n\nTrestor – in collaboration with IIT Bombay – wants to assist their leader in his vision to keep people away from littering. The company has therefore come up with an idea to reward citizens for turning waste items into their “Swacch Machine”.\n\nTo put this into perspective, a Swacch Machine is a project stemming forth from a collaboration between Trestor and several IIT Bombay students. As people would come to expect from such a collaboration, the primary purpose is to incentivize people to participate in the Clean India Mission. Everyone who puts a recyclable waste item inside the Swacch Machine will be reward with “trest”.\n\nThis is where the digital currency aspect comes into the picture, as every trest is a digital value token. But unlike most other forms of digital tokens, users do not need to store trest on a mobile device, although they can. An alternative option is available, which lets users receive a printout of the token so they can spend it immediately. These tokens award participants with 300ml of clean drinking water, which will be of great value with the expected drought in Mumbai this year.\n\nSimilarly to most recycling units, the Clean India Mission Swacch Machine has several compartments. One part deals with cans, whereas the other deals with bottles. The third and final chamber is designed to handle waste materials that are neither cans or bottles. Once the waste has been detected, corresponding tokens will be issued. On the inside of the machine, waste is reduced to one-sixth of its size.\n\nIt is kind of interesting to see this initiative take off in India, as the Bitcoin-esque approach by Trestor brings the concept of digital currency to an issue everyone can relate to. In fact, Trestor is a startup with the usage of Bitcoin to connect local communities as their primary objective. Issuing digital tokens is a great way to reduce waste and help the community at the same time.\n\nSource: Business Insider India\n\nHeader image courtesy of Clean India Mission"", 'In February, Bitcoin Magazine reported that The Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project, a collaborative effort started in December to establish, build and sustain an open, distributed ledger platform that will satisfy a variety of use cases across multiple industries, was announcing new members from across the industry, technical updates and a formal open governance structure.\n\nIn March, The Linux Foundation announced that 10 new companies joined the Hyperledger Project.\n\n“The Hyperledger Project is gaining traction on a daily basis, displaying how vital this effort is in advancing distributed ledger technology,” said Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, who was appointed board chair for the Hyperledger Project. It’s worth noting that Masters, among others, expressed support for private, “permissioned” non-Bitcoin blockchains, which seems to be the direction chosen by the Hyperdedger Project.\n\nTechnology giant Intel is a member of the Hyperledger Project.\n\n“Blockchain technology can help enable secure transfer of digital assets among known and unknown parties,” said Imad Sousou, vice president and general manager of the Open Source Technology Center at Intel. ""Intel looks forward to collaborating with the Hyperledger Project to advance the security, scalability, and privacy of transactions in enterprise and permission-less systems.”\n\nLast week, Intel published its plan to develop a distributed ledger, the “Sawtooth Lake” platform, which promises to allow companies to run their own blockchain, providing a permanent digital record, International Business Times reports. Intel will submit the Sawtooth Lake code to the open-source Hyperledger Project.\n\nSawtooth Lake is a modular platform for building, deploying and running distributed ledgers. The platform supports customizable data models to capture the current state of the ledger, transaction languages to change the ledger state, and consensus methods to validate transactions.\n\nSawtooth users are able to define their own custom “transaction family” with data models and transaction languages tailored to their use case. To make initial development simpler, the Sawtooth platform comes with three built-in transaction families to implement frequent use cases and provide a ready-to-use ledger with a fully functional marketplace for digital assets.\n\nEndPointRegistry is a built-in transaction family for registering ledger services; IntegerKey is a transaction family used for testing deployed ledgers; and MarketPlace is a transaction family for buying, selling and trading digital assets.\n\nThe Sawtooth Lake platform provides two consensus protocols with different performance trade-offs. The first, called PoET for “Proof of Elapsed Time,” is a lottery protocol that builds on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provided by Intel’s Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to address the needs of large populations of participants. The second, Quorum Voting, is an adaptation of the Ripple and Stellar consensus protocols and serves to address the needs of applications that require immediate transaction finality.\n\nPoET uses a TEE such as SGX to ensure a safe, random and robust lottery function without the specialized hardware and high power required by most proof algorithms. Intel’s approach is based on a guaranteed wait time provided through the TEE. According to Intel, the algorithm scales to thousands of participants and will run efficiently on any Intel processor that supports SGX.\n\nThe current release, still experimental, includes software which runs outside of SGX and simulates the behavior of the PoET algorithm.\n\n“It does not provide security in this mode,” notes Intel. “This project is intended for experimental usage and we recommend against using it for security sensitive applications.”\n\nIn related news, IBM, another Hyperledger Project member, plans to combine blockchain’s distributed ledger technology with its Artificial Intelligence system Watson for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\n\nThe IoT seems the main interest of Intel as well. “While Bitcoin is the most popular distributed ledger, the technology has been proposed for many different applications ranging from international remittance, insurance claim processing, supply chain management and the Internet of Things (IoT),” notes the company.\n\nIn fact, while Internet payments aren’t the main focus of Intel, the IoT is a strategic area of growing importance for the tech giant, and one which could certainly use the robustness and resiliency provided by distributed ledger technology.\n\n“The Internet of Things (IoT) is fueling innovation in nearly every part of our lives,” notes the Intel IoT website. “With the potential of thousands of new connected things bringing a tidal wave of new data, businesses want a better grasp of expected ROI, cost, and scalability, while IT managers struggle with integration, interoperability, and management concerns.”', 'Overstock.com CEO and chairman Patrick Byrne has taken an indefinite medical leave of absence from the company, a decision will be felt most among the worldwide community working to advance bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nByrne has a long history of medical problems after a long bout with cancer nearly 30 years ago. Due to the cancer and related heart problems, Byrne says, he has undergone more than 106 surgeries over the last three decades. And in the last year, he has battled a recurrence of Hepatitis C, which he first contracted on a visit to China in the early \'80s. ""I\'ve been really gutting it out over the past few months,"" he says.\n\nHis decision to take a leave of absence from Overstock—a cut-rate online retailer based in Salt Lake City, Utah—will be felt most among the worldwide community working to advance bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain, the vast digital ledger that underpins the digital currency. Guided by Byrne, Overstock was the first major retailer to accept payments in bitcoin, and perhaps more importantly, he led the creation of an Overstock subsidiary called TØ.com, which uses the blockchain and related technologies to build services that can track the exchange of financial securities.\n\nIn discussing his leave, Byrne expresses little worry over the health of Overstock, but shows considerable remorse because he is unable to continue his work with the blockchain, referring to its rise as an ""extinction event"" for the financial industry.\n\nRunning atop a network of independent machines spread across the globe, the blockchain was originally built to oversee the exchange of money, using cryptographic algorithms to verify transactions. But it can also track the exchange of anything else that carries value—including stocks, bonds, futures, and other financial securities—and thanks to those same cryptographic algorithms, it can do so without the oversight of any one central institution. Much as the blockchain can drive a money system outside the control of any one government, it can also juggle stock outside the control of any one bank.\n\n""It provides a database that can be shared by multiple entities who have different economic or political agendas and therefore don\'t necessary trust each other,"" says Gideon Greenspan, the CEO and founder of Coin Sciences, another company that\'s exploring blockchain applications that extend beyond bitcoin. ""There\'s no central gatekeeper checking all transactions that come in, saying what\'s valid and what\'s not.""\n\nIn many ways, Byrne has aimed to remake Wall Street.\n\nByrne and Overstock started work on their blockchain system almost two years ago, and this past December, after months of back and forth, the SEC approved the company\'s plan to offer public shares via the blockchain. The idea is that the company can issue shares without the help of Wall Street. Byrne envisions other companies IPO-ing through the same system—going public in a more democratic way. But this system can handle other assets, too. Overstock has already issued private bonds on the system, and TØ has built a separate service that oversees stock loans.\n\nMany others are exploring similar technology—even some within Wall Street establishment. Nasdaq OMX, the company behind the Nasdaq public exchange, is building a system that uses the blockchain to oversee the market for stock in companies that are still private. And a wide range of big-name banks and tech companies have put their weight behind an open-source project called the Open Ledger Project, or Hyperledger, which aims to build new software that operates much like the blockchain. But Byrne has long been out in front of this online revolution. In many ways, his efforts have aimed to remake Wall Street, and now, the big Wall Street names are trying to remake themselves before they get left behind.\n\nByrne has a long history of pushing for reform on Wall Street. Overstock was among the first companies that went public under what\'s called a Dutch Auction, which lets the market set the price for an IPO, not some big Wall Street bank. In working to offer stock over the blockchain, the company is taking this idea even further.\n\nHis leave of absence casts some doubt over Overstock\'s blockchain ambitions. But Byrne says he will recommend that general counsel Mitch Edwards, who had been closely involved with the development of TØ, now serve as the company\'s interim CEO. Byrne feels a certain sadness that he will not be part of effort for the foreseeable future, but he\'s adamant that Overstock\'s effort will continue apace. ""I\'ve worked really hard,"" he says, ""to get this revolution going in the right direction.""', 'A wall. Trump still wants a wall. That’s what he says.Earlier this week, when Trump revealed his plan to block remittances from illegal immigrants to their families – calling it “welfare” – he failed to demonstrate his understanding of the Internet and contemporary, borderless commerce.\n\nIf it’s not remittances, immigrants in the US will figure out a way to send their money home if they want to do so. For now, it’s not going to be Bitcoin. But, if Trump does block remittances, you better believe that sooner than later increasing numbers of remitters will look into this blockchain technology. Knowing crypto-currency enthusiasts, they’ll likely troll Trump with Wallcoin. Or “Wall: The Blockchain Solution That Knows No Walls.” There’s already “Trumpcoin.”\n\nTrump wants to use a US anti-terrorism law to ban such money transfers unless Trump made a one-time payment of $5 billion to $10 billion.

A Trump Administration would propose a rule mandating companies like Western Union Co to require customers prove they were earned legally.\n\n“It’s an easy decision for Mexico,” his campaign said.\n\nAbout $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexicans in the United States return home to Mexico.\n\n“It (remittances) serves as de facto welfare for poor families in Mexico. There is no significant social safety net provided by the state in Mexico,” Trump claimed.\n\nObama mocked the idea: “The notion that we’re going to track every Western Union bit of money that’s being sent to Mexico, you know, good luck with that.”\n\nMexican President Enrique Pena Nieto’s office told Reuters: “The (Mexican) Presidency has no comment on any opinion made in the heat of the electoral process to choose candidates for the U.S. presidency.”\n\nTrump wants to target visas, and impose trade tariffs and enforcing trade rules in order to for Mexico to finance a wall.\n\nI’m sure MoneyGram International and PayPal Holdings Inc’s won’t love Trump’s idea. But, I know some people who will love it – Bitcoiners.\n\nThere are already Bitcoin ATM’s in both the US, where there are the most, and Mexico. In Tijuana, the Pacific border city 15 miles south of San Diego, there were two Bitcoin ATM’s hosted by Bitcoin42. While Bitcoin has faced barriers to growth in Baja, Trump’s proposal could make it an attractive option for remitters. The Bitcoin ATM’s – at IMAXESS and BitCenter – appear, due to lack of demand, to have closed. In Mexico City, there are two machines still online.\n\nFantastico Comics in Mexico City hosts a Genesis Bitcoin machine. In Puebla, outside of Mexico City, there’s reportedly a Lamassu machine at Coffee York.\n\nI’m sure each machine would enjoy an uptick in volume if Trump gets his way.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It is worth noting how Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, personally invited Mr. Medcraft.

Whilst ""disintermediation"" might be a term you\'d be keen to see on a game of Hipster Bingo, we\'ve all been desperately in love with disintermediation since the internet became a big deal because at its core, disintermediation is what the internet ""does.""\n\nDisintermediation is about removing intermediaries, and we generally like to remove middlemen because although they provide value, they also take our money for their profit. Take the intermediary out of a system, and others in the chain have a little bit more money.\n\nThe internet is the most powerful tool for disintermediation we\'ve ever seen. We tend to call this process ""disruption."" What actually happens is that some previously successful business wakes up and finds out it no longer has one because someone has ruined their business model by negating their value as intermediaries in the value chain.\n\nMost businesses don\'t see this coming, because most businesses are fairly inept at modelling and understanding risk. But there is one type of business that\'s very good at managing out risk: banks.\n\nRisk\n\nTo a bank, Bitcoin is a tremendously scary thing. Most of what a bank does is designed to keep them sitting in the middle, adding some value, and taking a cut for providing that value. A considerable amount of the value they provide comes from helping people store and move money around. For the ""end user,"" having money in some digital form is a lot easier than dealing with cash, hence why we pay the banks to reward them for provisioning that value.\n\nBitcoin is digital cash. It can be stored and exchanged without having to have an intermediary involved, because at its core it is a disintermediated system. You can buy a miner, refine electricity into Bitcoin, and send those Bitcoins to anyone in the world – all without needing a bank account or asking a bank to transfer the money for you. It\'s this disruption that banks fear.\n\nThis is why we see banks talking so much about blockchain and Bitcoin, although most of them are talking about blockchain rather than Bitcoin. (Which is fair, because Bitcoin itself is a bit of a basket case.)\n\nWhat we see is the banks making a huge investment in blockchain because rather than burying their heads in the sand, they see a huge risk to their position as intermediaries. They are managing out that risk through investment – know thine enemy, etc etc. Look for references to ""R3 CEV"" – a commercial entity that manages a consortium of around 42 banks, all of which are big players. It\'s a bit Bilderberg-ish.\n\nReality\n\nIf you\'re not a bank, the blockchain is unlikely to present such a specifically clear threat.\n\nThe blockchain is a very specific type of database. Right now, however, most people get very excited about it and run around with a hammer thinking everything they see is a nail. In reality, it\'s hard to find good use cases for it.\n\nBlockchains allow an application developer to create a distributed database that can be read by anyone, but can only be written to by consensus.\n\nThis consensus isn\'t done by voting. Writing to a blockchain takes a considerable amount of processing time, and this is a deliberate design requirement. Running a computer takes real money, because you have to buy electricity. Therefore, if you want to write data into a blockchain, you have to be motivated to put your hand in your pocket and pay for that electricity. This approach grounds the whole system in real-world economics. It\'s this part that makes Bitcoin as a system make sense – it has refined electricity the same way that the ""normal"" money that we use at some point maps down to some refined scarce resource.\n\nHowever, once the data is in there, anyone can read it. For example, anyone can download all of Bitcoin\'s blockchain and read out every transaction that\'s ever been on the system since the original so-called ""genesis block.""\n\nComing back to use cases, we now have a database system with use cases that involve groups of entities, who don\'t really trust each other, who all want to update a single system, but who don\'t really mind about transaction times. (Because all this proving of work by definition takes a very, very long time compared to normal database.) Moreover, we\'re talking about groups of entities that cannot be bound into trusting each other through some other form – e.g., contracted terms. Generally in our society, we\'re fairly good at building contracts that define how entities work with each other.\n\nFrom a non-commercial perspective, some sort of new version of Twitter that used a blockchain to record messages would fit that model because all the messages (""transactions"") are public, and getting everyone to trust each other is impossible.\n\nCommercial use-cases are well suited to systems where the entities which are involved include a regulatory authority or government agency. Imagine an aircraft maintenance firm where all the work orders and dockets are put into the blockchain, where the FAA, CAA and other such bodies can examine the records after a crash knowing they cannot be lost or modified.\n\nThe reason why I\'ve included regulatory authorities in that example is because it highlights the advantage of these sorts of systems, where exposing data publicly is key. In this case, we have a public interest element but it could simply be that it\'s advantageous to be more visible with your customers. If you don\'t need to open up the data-set, it may well be satisfactory just to stick with traditional systems.\n\nI\'m melting, I\'m melting\n\nThe hype around blockchain comes from the fact that it looks to disintermediate banks. Fundamentally, a non-fiat currency that behaves like cash – whether that\'s Bitcoin or something else – is terrifying to a bank. So they\'re investing in understanding the risk. And we listen, because when banks invest, it attracts attention because it tweaks our nerves around fear or around greed.\n\nAlthough the hype starts with money, the question is ""will the hype sustain""? In a post-Edward-Snowden world, ""trust"" is a complex idea. If we centralise trust, it\'s possible for certain types of actors to try and exploit the centralised nature of this system. Think CIA in Snowden-type examples, think the FBI in ""please-give-us-a-specific-version-of-iOS-so-that-we-can-brute-force-this-iPhone""-type examples.\n\nThe blockchain is our first real example of a technology that allows us to build systems with disintermediated trust. That aspect itself is beyond hype – from a societal perspective we\'ll likely gravitate towards systems where trust cannot be exploited, and the blockchain is a great way of building those types of systems. ®', 'The Australia-based Bitcoin exchange Igot has been struggling to completely deliver on operations with Bitcoins or refund customers their money.\n\nThe company was founded in 2013 and offered exchange services in 40 different countries, including the ability to buy and sell Bitcoins, remittance services, futures tradings and merchant services.\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether the company actually signed up merchants and provided listed services beside basic buy/sell exchange services, as was advertised by the company.\n\nShady background of Igot Bitcoin exchange\n\nThere are certain concerns about the background of the company. It is referred to as an Australia-based company registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC/ABN: 600 161 233), in Melbourne in June, almost 12 months after it was founded.\n\nIn addition to this, there are some questions about the contact address of the company, with the main office listed in Adelaide, and agent offices in Ljubljana, Slovenia; Kowloon, Hong Kong; Singapore and Bangalore, India.\n\nResearch by SiliconANGLE showed that these are all virtual and therefore not legitimate offices.\n\nQuestionable reputation\n\nIgot’s main goal was to make operations with Bitcoin easy, simple and safe. So far the company managed to attract attention by being at the center of huge misunderstandings and failing to fulfill its obligations towards customers.\n\nIn May last year, the Bitcoin exchange experienced delays for bitcoin and fiat currency withdrawals, which were mainly associated with major platform updates. To calm worrying customers, Igot offered reduced trading fees and other complementary measures.\n\nLater in June, Igot was victim to a Distributed Denial of Service Attack and came under fire once again with dozens of customers and clients complaining about delays with their withdrawals, expressing doubts about the trustworthiness of the company and claiming that they were robbed.\n\nThere have been some heated discussions going on on social media, including Facebook, Twitter and Reddit with most users expressing their dissatisfaction about the way Igot is handling the situation.\n\nFor instance, a Bitcoin community member who invested a significant amount of money in Bitcoin through the Igot platform says on Reddit:\n\n“Igot is not being honest and transparent. We are given many different reasons and explanations behind the problem that don’t really fit together”.\n\nCommenting on delays with withdrawals, Igot’s founder and CEO, Rick Day, at that time claimed that the situation was under control and there was no reason to worry about company owners escaping with all the investments.\n\nMurky financial performance\n\nIn June 2014 a founder of Igot expressed his excitement about an agreement with Jesse Chenard, who was invited to partner with the company as a major investor and company advisor. After a thorough analysis of the company’s finances, Chenard found that Igot was not buying enough bitcoins for the money it was taking in.\n\nJesse Chenard tells ABC:\n\n“What people thought they had bought with their Australian dollars or Indian rupees, or whatever currency they were dealing in - wasn’t actually bought”.\n\nSoon after Chenard stopped advising for Igot and made a decision not to invest in the company.\n\nFor now, Igot has ceased trading with users, and stopped all public communications, whilst not responding to users’ complaints. Was it all a big scam?\n\nFrom skepticism to enthusiasm and back\n\nWith growing interest in cryptocurrencies and rapid development of blockchain technologies underpinning them, skepticism among consumers and financial institutions has given way to enthusiasm.\n\nThe European Union recognized it as a currency, Germany classified it as private money, and Finland classified it as a commodity, while technology giant Microsoft started collaborating with a number of banks developing blockchain technology potentially for the use of financial services.\n\nHowever, innovations carry significant challenges and concerns along with opportunities. One of the most important concerns here is security and trust.\n\nThe fall of MtGox has brought some uncertainty as to how reputable exchanges are, and many traders interested in making investments in cryptocurrencies have become very wary of these exchanges. When trusting a bitcoin exchange with money, everybody wants to be sure that their security measures are of the utmost importance.\n\nAll Bitcoin exchanges share certain key functionality, however their effectiveness as trading networks as well as the security measures they introduce vary significantly.\n\nCreating a safer environment together\n\nThere is very little government regulation around bitcoin and a lot remains to be done in that area. Regulatory discussions around digital currencies have really ramped up during the last few years, and many cryptocurrency experts are positive about further development of regulatory frameworks, which will only help the community’s Bitcoin legitimization efforts and find a balance between risks and business opportunities.\n\nEarlier this month, CoinTelegraph spoke with Peter Ohser, EVP of MoneyGram at Europe Money 20/20, to discuss the future of blockchain technology and the contribution it could make in the development of financial services.\n\nHe expressed his concerns about the evolution of regulation around Bitcoin and its core technology:\n\n“We still need to be able to have control, visibility and transparency of that throughout the process. The premise of blockchain is open, but the challenge with being open is going against the regulatory regimes and what people are being forced to do at certain levels, so there is a lot of friction right now between those two things”.\n\nKen Lo, CEO of ANX, a Hong Kong- based financial technology company, says:\n\n“There will become more regulations and many governments will start revealing their stance on how they want bitcoins to be regulated. This will be a bit painful in the beginning, but in the long run it will give a framework for bitcoin companies to work around”.\n\nFrederik Thenault, Founder of iceVault, a Switzerland-based Bitcoin storage, agrees:\n\n“Despite the fact that the beginnings of Bitcoin were plagued with the negative purposes that people could use them for, e.g. money laundering, drugs and arms trafficking,, the vast majority of people want to use it for legitimate reasons. It is now seen as a cheaper, faster way of making payments, and as an investment tool. A reasonable amount of regulation means a safer range of services that can benefit users, especially since some of them have been defrauded from their Bitcoin holdings either through hacking or through misplacing trust in unreliable service providers”.\n\nFurther development in the cryptocurrency space demands guidelines and safety guards that reasonable regulations could help foment and protect bitcoin users from the risk of fraud. CoinTelegraph looks forward to seeing what the future holds for this emerging sector.', 'The writing was on the wall, but sometimes the allure of unrealistic returns gets the better of people. The Belvedere Ponzi scandal expose’ should have acted as a stark warning two years ago. But in September last year Russian-based MMM Global was listed as a potential pyramid scheme by the National Consumer Commission of South Africa, offering 30 percent returns. And worse yet, it was run by a known fraudster Sergey Mavrodi, who was convicted of defrauding 10 000 investors of around R520 million in a Russian court in 2007. Nothing was taken further and now Mavrodi’s gone into hiding, with investors potentially cashless. And as much as investors have to take responsibility for their actions, surely regulators need to get more involved and have more firepower to stop situations like this. Prevention is better than a cure. Fin24’s Matthew le Cordeur lays out the complete story below, as another one bites the dust. – Stuart Lowman\n\nBy Matthew le Cordeur\n\nCape Town – Russian convict Sergey Mavrodi has allegedly gone into hiding after announcing that his Bitcoin-based MMM Global scheme had failed and was shutting down this weekend.\n\nMMM South Africa – its local branch – is one of nine companies being investigated for being an alleged Ponzi scheme by the South African Police Service’s Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit, after the National Consumer Commission’s initial probe in 2015.\n\nThe South African “community” has been growing in numbers over the years, as South Africans seek ways to escape debt and poverty. It has even been described as a stokvel by some, and has become an emotive topic for those who buy into it.\n\nOfficially, the SA platform said its members are encouraged to donate money to others by rewarding them with the bitcoin currency in return, and can apparently get 30% return on their rand investment by doing so. A Ponzi scheme occurs when a return is 20% higher than the repo rate, which in SA is 7%.\n\n“We regret to inform you that we have to close down the Republic of Bitcoin. It was an experiment, and, unfortunately, it failed,” the last Facebook entry on MMM Global states. “We turned out not to be able to pay 100% per month.”\n\nThe South African branch offers 30% returns. The alleged scheme is based on the bitcoin currency, which is a digital asset and a payment system.\n\nMMM Global cannot sustain paying\n\nA website that investigates multi-level marketing schemes predicted the collapse a few days before it happened.\n\nOn April 9, it revealed the implosion. “The financial apocalypse is upon us, MMM Global has collapsed,” BehindMLM reported.\n\n“MMM Global’s Ponzi clones offering a lower percentage haven’t ‘proved’ themselves any more than MMM Global did,” it said.\n\n“MMM Global cannot sustain paying out more than is invested. And as long as affiliate investment is the only source of revenue entering the scheme, any MMM Global scheme will ultimately collapse.\n\n“They’ll continue to pay ROIs (return on investments) until withdrawals exceed the rate of new investment, and then run out of money all the same. One only needs to look at the collapse of MMM China for evidence of what’s to come.\n\n“Unfortunately for most MMM Global investors, the collapse is the end of the line. Those unlucky enough to live in countries where MMM Global runs secondary scams (like South Africa), were informed their accounts would be transferred over.”\n\nMavrodi has executed his exit strategy – claim\n\nBehind MLM said Mavrodi “executed his exit strategy a few weeks ago. On March 20th Mavrodi informed investors there would be no more news updates published to the MMM Global website”.\n\n“Mavrodi has not been heard from or seen since, and is presumed to be on the run. It’s highly likely he withdrew and/or transferred out as much of the money he stole from investors before fleeing.”\n\nFinancial Times reported on Monday that, while it is yet to confirm with its Mavrodi sources, “if internet reports are anything to go by it looks like Mavrodi’s latest scheme … dubbed a ‘mutual aid social network’ … collapsed over the weekend, with thousands of investors (a lot of them in emerging markets) locked out of investment accounts they had been promised would yield them 100% returns per month”.\n\nMMM SA defends operation\n\nHowever, MMM Global South Africa refuted the claims that it was a Ponzi scheme or that it was collapsing on Monday.\n\n“In the MMM community there are many different countries,” a member of the MMM SA team said in a Facebook message to Fin24 on Monday.\n\n“One of them was the Republic of Bitcoin. It was a ‘synthetic’ country which united participants from many different countries who provided and received help with bitcoins.\n\n“Sometimes it created confusion for the people, they asked whether they should join the Republic of Bitcoin (RB) or MMM SA, RB or MMM France, etc.\n\n“We decided to dissolve the Republic of Bitcoin and people will continue to participate in their specific countries. So, those South Africans who participated in the Republic of Bitcoin will be moved to MMM South Africa. And people will be able to continue to participate and will continue to receive help on the South African Platform.”\n\nMMM South Africa calls itself “a community of ordinary people, selflessly helping each other” on its colourful website. “The goal here is not the money. The goal is to destroy the world’s unjust financial system.”\n\nNot a Ponzi scheme – member\n\nThe anonymous member told Fin24 that MMM does not receive payment and does not pay its members, so therefore cannot be classified a Ponzi scheme. “MMM is a platform for the exchange of donations where people send money (pay) to each other.”\n\n“When you call the MMM Community a Ponzi scheme, it creates a misunderstanding,” the person said. “In MMM people donate (not invest) money to each other without any promises or guarantees. MMM does not offer any return or an interest rate.\n\n“MMM honestly tell people how it really works and do not promise people any return on the investments. As a donation programme, how is it possible to lose your donation? In MMM people ask each other to help them. It depends on the members themselves to maintain the continuation of the process of the provision of help to each other.\n\n“MMM does not make any promises and do not claim to generate any return as Ponzi schemes do. On the MMM website, it is written with capital letters that there are no promises or guarantees.\n\n“After MMM members donate money, they may be rewarded with Mavro (the bitcoin currency),” the person said.\n\n“Usually Mavro grows 30% a month. Mavro is not an asset or currency, Mavro is a motivation instrument. With Mavro, MMM motivates its members to help each other by providing financial assistance.\n\n“Because Mavro is not a financial instrument, its growth rate can be easily adjusted to balance PH (providing help, inflow) and GH (getting help, outflow). The flow of provided assistance and assistance received will always be kept in balance.\n\n“The MMM Community has been operating for many years. More and more people are joining now. Unfortunately, sometimes there is a misunderstanding when people try to present MMM as an investment project or money making scheme.” – Fin24\n\nSource: http://www.fin24.com/Money/Investments/alleged-sa-ponzi-scheme-mmms-global-pyramid-collapses-20160412', 'Home-rental company Airbnb has “acqui-hired” the majority of the team behind ChangeCoin, a startup that runs a bitcoin-based micropayments service, according to four people with knowledge of the deal.\n\nThe alternative lodging site has been looking at a few bitcoin and blockchain startups, according to two sources, to study what the technology could do for its services. Companies like Uber and Airbnb are built on their ability to manage supply and demand, which could be aided by a powerful, open ledger system like blockchain.\n\nThrough a service called ChangeTip, ChangeCoin lets users send tiny amounts of money, or tips, over social networks including Twitter and Reddit. But Airbnb appears to only be interested in the talent behind the company: ChangeCoin is still shopping its intellectual property, sources said.\n\nThe firm is run by ex-Yahoo engineer and noted bitcoin entrepreneur Nick Sullivan, and has between 11 and 50 employees, according to CrunchBase.\n\nWhereas financial firms have been devoting resources and announcing pilot projects around blockchain, consumer technology companies haven’t said much on the topic. But Airbnb recently hinted at its interest in the tech, with Nathan Blecharczyk, a co-founder and the company’s chief technology officer, telling CityAM that blockchains might allow Airbnb to share its user profiles with other companies. “The question is whether there’s a way to export [a user’s reputation] and allow access elsewhere to help other sharing economy models really flourish,” he said.\n\nAs Airbnb has grown its userbase to more than 17 million in summer 2015, according to the company (pdf), it’s also developed a valuable database of reviews and ratings that let hosts and guest judge the trustworthiness of who they’re dealing with. “Within the context of Airbnb, your reputation is everything, and I can see it being even more so in the future, whereby you might need a certain reputation in order to have access to certain types of homes,” Blecharczyk told CityAM.\n\nTrust is something blockchains are uniquely suited to dealing with. They can provide a permanent record of transactions and other data, and, in some cases, can render that data universally readable, as in the case of the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIf Airbnb can figure out a way to make its user profiles immutable and universally readable, they could become a trusted form of digital identity, a bit like the profiles that credit bureaus create for individuals. If these identities can be “exported” to other platforms, as Blecharczyk said, they could become hugely valuable. An Uber driver, for example, might know if his next passenger came with a history of leaving Airbnb properties damaged.\n\nIf Airbnb’s feeling adventurous, it could also start exploring more esoteric, but potentially hugely useful, ways of using blockchains, such as door locks that open or close when a user sends money to a homeowner over a blockchain.\n\nChangeTip built a relatively successful product, but it wasn’t enough to build a sustainable company. ChangeCoin had been shopping itself to highly valued, consumer-facing startups for several months, according to a source with knowledge of the deal.\n\nSince launching in 2014, ChangeCoin has raised $5 million from investors including 500 Startups, Digital Currency Group, and Pantera Capital, according to Pitchbook.', 'When the digital currency Bitcoin was first released in 2009, it divided opinion. Would we really place our trust in a piece of open-source software rather than a bank? Could society reorder itself so that a decentralised, international currency with no one in charge of it could succeed?\n\nSeven years, multiple bubble warnings and one near-disastrous technical hitch later, the answers are still unclear. Bitcoin is now accepted by many online vendors (which has earned it a reputation for being a currency used by criminals) but also by a handful of pubs, Cumbria University’s tuition fees department and the US senator Rand Paul.\n\nThe currency is now valued at over $6bn, and though many “altcoin” cryptocurrencies have sprung up to challenge it, none has succeeded. One has come much closer than any other, though: Ethereum, which was launched in the summer of 2015.\n\nEther, the system’s currency unit, reached a value of $1bn (though it has since dropped slightly from this figure). But its uses are far more complex than Bitcoin’s, and potentially world-changing.\n\nFirst, some background: cryptocurrencies are based on the idea that a digital ledger of payments, or “blockchain”, can be used as a middleman in financial transactions instead of a bank. The ledger is overseen and maintained by its users, doesn’t claim fees, isn’t tied to a specific country or government, and cannot be censored or mismanaged. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, a 19-year-old Russian programmer, posted the first proposal for Ethereum on GitHub, a website usually used as a repository for code. He was fascinated by cryptocurrencies and had founded the magazine Bitcoin in 2011 – but now, he argued that the “distributed consensus” offered by blockchains could go far beyond currency.\n\nKen Kappler, who worked at Ethereum in 2015 and is now head of business development at Ethcore, at tells me that the founders’ early research began in the world of “altcoins” and cryptocurrency but quickly moved on. “It gave way to how generically useful the technology could become. Currency is just one thing we no longer have to rely on central record-keeping for.”\n\nOn GitHub, Buterin proposed a “Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralised Application Platform”, which would use a blockchain to verify and monitor legal contracts, land registries and anything else that requires an objective, third-party record system. Gavin Wood, the system’s co-creator, has described Ethereum as “one computer for the entire planet”. This is because it does not operate from a single server and is not localised. You can’t turn it off, or change any of the transactions that have already taken place.\n\nIt’s a deeply abstract concept, and the ramifications of this type of system are not yet clear, even to its creators. When Wood addressed the first Ethereum developer conference in London last year, he said: “What is Ethereum? We just don’t know.”\n\nSince its launch, Ethereum has become best known for its currency (Kappler tells me the most common misconception is that “it’s all about money”) but it is beginning to forge pathways into other industries. In some cases this has been enabled by industry itself: Microsoft now offers the Ethereum software on its cloud service for use by enterprises and developers. The singer Imogen Heap has released a song for purchase using Ether, and has said she hopes that the service will decentralise the music industry by using smart contracts and payments.\n\nThe best way to think of Ethereum, and blockchain technology in general, is as a kind of crypto-law, which can oversee processes we previously entrusted exclusively to human beings. It is “disruptive” in a sense that is rarely true when we describe new technologies, because it has the capacity to replace the industries we use to oversee finance, many aspects of law, and the vending and sale of products.\n\nAnd yet, as with Bitcoin, Ethereum’s potential is tied to uptake among users. A 2015 Coindesk survey of roughly 4,000 Bitcoin users found that they were overridingly male, 25-34 years old, and living in the US or Europe. This may have changed since, but it demonstrates how new, challenging technologies can be slow to become mainstream.\n\nBlockchain technology relies on customer trust. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum argue that we should trust them more than the human-run institutions we are used to, as human error, bias or corruption can play no part. Yet it may be some time before the average person is willing to take this as gospel truth.\n\nAs a result, integration into existing companies may be the quickest route forward for Ethereum. Its uptake by Microsoft is already having a positive impact elsewhere and, crucially, it has increased its overall value. Ironically, for a radically decentralised system that could overturn modern capitalism, Ethereum may find that its early integration into society ends up being top-down.', 'CoinWallet, an online bitcoin and multicoin wallet service has announced the closure of its services. The announcement cites a recent data breach that struck the wallet and bitcoin services provider on April 6, 2016.\n\nOnline multicoin wallet service Coinwallet is shutting down its services following a recent data breach. Although the extent of the breach hasn’t been determined, the incident led CoinWallet management to conclude that recovery and realigning costs would not be feasible, thereby announcing the closure of the service in its entirety.\n\nThe announcement also leaves no reason to believe that the service will be resumed at a later time.\n\nThe blog post revealed a “small error” among the code that proved to be the bitcoin service provider’s undoing.\n\n“Despite our best efforts, there was a small error in a part of our code that should have checked and sanitized user input on a recently added function,” CoinWallet explained.\n\nNo coins were lost as a result of the breach, thanks to a backup security infrastructure that ensured the system worked as it should. The vulnerability has since been patched, although the extent of the breach is still being determined by the wallet service.\n\nNotably, the announcement urges users to change passwords on other websites and crypto-related domains, if a common username and password has been shared. Users’ passwords, while encrypted and salted for additional security on CoinWallet, can still be compromised.\n\nFor its part, London-based CoinWallet has reset all user passwords and deleted all issued API keys.\n\nThe announcement read:\n\nThis incident prompted us to reassess the viability of running coinwallet.co and it was decided it is just not viable taking into consideration the risk, costs and time involved.\n\nCoinWallet users are advised to withdraw all their coins before May 1, 2016. Since coins weren’t affected by the breach, they are available for immediate withdrawal.\n\nThe service added that a large a volume of transactions is expected over the following days and weeks, cautioning users against possible delays in processing some transactions. However, CoinWallet also assured users that it will process all outstanding transactions before its impending closure.\n\nCybersecurity-related incidents are fairly common among crypto-service providers and websites. Bitcoin exchange Shapeshift.io was the target of one such breach in recent times, an incident that led to the shutting down of trading before the website was taken offline entirely, for an upgrade of its infrastructure. At the time of publishing, Shapeshift remains offline, citing downtime.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Circle Internet Financial set off a wave of positive press last week when it revealed the news that it had become an electronic money institution registered under the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK.\n\nThough enthusiasm was high, there was confusion over the nature of the licensing and how it enables Circle to further its operations. Of note, is that the e-money license is not digital currency-specific, with the E-Money Directive being introduced in the UK in September 2009. The FCA, sources noted, is still debating how it will seek to regulate digital currencies in the UK.\n\nHowever, the e-money license does now allow Circle to work with the UK Treasury on a process by which it will inform regulators in other European nations of the license in a bid that could find it expanding its fiat money services across the European Union.\n\nFor now, the licensure proved sufficient to enable Circle to establish a relationship with UK banking giant Barclays. As such, industry commentators were quick to voice their belief that the announcement would do much to improve the perception of bitcoin and blockchain technologies more broadly.\n\nIDC Financial Insights research director James Wester, for instance, said the news was perhaps a sign that the idea is falling out of favor that blockchain and distributed ledgers would disrupt payments and banking, and that banks may now become key drivers of the emerging technology’s wider adoption.\n\nWester told CoinDesk:\n\n""Banks themselves are [now] exploring the potential for the technology. So over time I think you will see more connections and relationships between the community building up around blockchain technologies and financial service providers, vendors and regulators.""\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria echoed this view, stating he believes Circle’s license would put pressure on global regulators, an opinion that was widely voiced in the community.\n\n""I expect other [regulators] to simply feel comfortable regulating the actual financial service provided without caring what network they are provided on,"" he said.\n\nOverall, sources compared the license to Circle’s traditional money services business (MSB) licenses in the US, where it is authorized to provide services in US dollars in all 50 states.\n\nAs such, the e-money license, they indicated, serves as a counterpart to its digital currency services, one that more directly relates to the company’s goal of innovating on the payments industry business model with blockchain technology, and that as such, is unlikely to have a wider impact on startups.\n\nMarket leader\n\nMost immediately, commentators agreed that the announcement further positioned Circle as a market leader in the digital currencies space. Founded in 2013 by Brightcove founder Jeremy Allaire and its senior architect Sean Neville, Circle has already raised $76m over three funding rounds, boasting investors such as Goldman Sachs and Fenway Summer.\n\nWester indicated that Circle’s license would now allow it to perform limited cross-border and cross-currency transfers from Europe to the US, a move that would allow them to test a prominent use case for blockchain at scale.\n\n""[This] is particularly interesting given that those transactions have often been cited as a good use case for blockchain,"" he said.\n\nCircle is also notably the only bitcoin services company to have received a license from New York state since the introduction of its state-specific regulatory regime, the BitLicense, in early 2015. According to CoinDesk estimates, more than 20 companies remain waiting for a formal approval for this designation, though the NYDFS has promised forthcoming news.\n\nBuckleySandler LLP counsel Dana Syracuse, who helped develop the BitLicense application in New York, said that the licensing is an example of how companies in the financial services industry can use regulation to compete for investment and business.\n\n""Ultimately, compliance distinguishes companies in the market,"" he said.\n\nCircle chief compliance officer John Beccia further stressed that regulation has become a key competitive advantage for Circle, even if other companies may not need a traditional money services license as part of their strategies.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Having taken that approach from day one to be engaged with regulators, to be very comprehensive, it’s been helpful in attracting investors and banks and in being able to get to market quickly.""\n\nUK pulls ahead\n\nIn a global context, commentators saw the news as the latest that finds the US and the UK competing for a front-runner position as the leader in global FinTech innovation.\n\nCommentators in the US were keen to stress that the announcement is perhaps proof that the UK’s strategy toward encouraging blockchain industry development is proving more successful in encouraging innovation.\n\nCoin Center director Jerry Brito, for instance, positioned Circle\'s opportunity to extend services across the EU as one that would not be possible in the US due to its state-by-state approach to bitcoin regulation.\n\n""If the US doesn’t wake up, it’s going to find itself behind and it’s going to lose the competitive edge,"" Brito told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n“This isn’t by chance, the UK government has identified this as a way they can compete with the US globally.”\n\nBrito cited the recent news that bitcoin exchange itBit had stopped serving consumers in Texas as evidence of how this is harming development of a more robust digital currencies ecosystem, holding it up as an example of state-by-state inconsistencies.\n\nBeccia agreed with this opinion, praising the FCA for a ""reasonable"" approach to the regulatory process.\n\n“The message is that the UK is being very proactive on this, they’re encouraging FinTech,” he said. “It’s been a really encouraging environment.”\n\nThe viewpoint that this development was potentially a negative for the US was supported by Consumers’ Research executive director Joe Colangelo, who voiced his belief that the announcement could encourage more innovation abroad.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""I wouldn\'t be surprised if this simplified approval from the UK led to more bitcoin and blockchain companies considering setting up shop overseas in the future.""\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Circle.\n\nRacetrack image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

For one, a cashless society would give governments and banks more power over people’s money. For example, the concept of negative interest rates falls apart if everyone is holding physical cash.\n\nBloomberg recently published an editorial endorsing the cashless society, and The New York Times has reported 20 percent of payments in Sweden are cash based. Additionally, the European Central Bank may soon axe the 500 euro bill. One only needs to do a search for “cashless society” on Google News to see all of the recent activity on this front.\n\nWhy Move Away from Cash?\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why some individuals would like to see a move to a cashless society. Some of these have to do with enhancing the ability for a government to control the economy, while others are about nothing more than enabling more efficient payments around the globe. Here are a few recent reasons given for moving away from cash (in no particular order):\n\nNegative interest rates - Negative interest rates have already been implemented in Japan and a few countries in Europe, and Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen recently stated the policy is not off the table in the United States if the economy were to become much weaker. In a cashless society, it would be more difficult for savers to avoid these negative rates, which would be viewed as a positive by central banks around the world. More control over the citizenry’s money - There are a variety of other government policies that are only made possible -- or at least more practical -- by the digitization of money. It’s much easier to pull off a bail-in, enact capital controls, collect taxes and generally control where money goes when it’s all ones and zeros in a centralized ledger. Terrorist financing, money laundering and other bad things - The reported use of the 500 euro bill by terrorist organizations and other bad actors is the main reason its existence is currently under review. Physical cash’s anonymous nature makes it attractive for illegal economic interactions. A completely digital monetary system would allow governments to track every fiat-denominated transaction with precision. Convenience - Digital payment options are also simply more convenient than cash. The Internet allows individuals to send money across long distances, and swiping a card is less cumbersome than fiddling with nickels and dimes. Lower costs - Issuing digital currency also comes with lower costs than printing physical cash.\n\nBitcoin as Digital Gold\n\nFrom the average person’s perspective, there are both positive and negative aspects of a cashless society. Loss of privacy and a lack of control over one’s own money are the main concerns, while the lower costs and convenience associated with virtual currencies can be attractive. As a digital asset, Bitcoin has the potential to help individuals fight against the potential downsides of a cashless society.\n\nWithout Bitcoin, a cashless society sounds like a rather Orwellian situation. In a world of government-issued digital currencies, governments essentially have the ability to track every transaction, and they can also reverse transactions or reallocate funds whenever they deem it necessary.\n\nGold is often viewed as a hedge against overreaching governments (usually as a way to avoid the inflation tax); however, gold’s physical form limits its usefulness in a digital age. Bitcoin is often referred to as a form of digital gold, and this role of the cryptocurrency becomes much more obvious in a cashless society. Bitcoin allows individuals to avoid payment censorship, fiat currency devaluations, heavy taxation, bail-ins, capital controls, financial surveillance (once privacy improvements are added), and many other negative aspects of virtual fiat currencies.\n\nUnlike gold, bitcoins can be transferred to anyone else in the world who has access to the Internet in a matter of minutes. Governments also have a tendency to shut down gold-backed virtual currencies, which is one of the reasons Bitcoin was created in the first place. The fact that virtual gold currencies require the backing of a third party is a security hole. In the past, as CypherpunkNick Szabo has explained, Bitcoin is also more secure than gold.\n\nBitcoin Is Not Without Its Flaws\n\nWhile Bitcoin has many advantages over gold, it is not without its own flaws. Price volatility and the complexities involved with simply understanding how Bitcoin works are two disadvantages of the system -- at least in the eyes of the general public. Having said that, users are willing to move to a new system when it is the best available option. For example, people who did not know about Bitcoin in 2011 learned how to use it because they wanted to shop on the less-censored Silk Road or make a donation to Wikileaks.\n\nAs physical cash becomes less prevalent and more of the economy moves to the digital world, Bitcoin could be poised to play a vital role as a hedge against various governments’ economic and monetary policies.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011. His work has been featured on VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, RT’s Keiser Report, and many other media outlets.

Senior members of U.S. Secretary of State’s John Kerry\'s economic team led business delegations from financial investors, U.S. multinational and early stage companies. In two stunning speeches, the State Department began advocating the adoption blockchain technology.\n\nAmbassador David H. Thorne, senior adviser to the secretary of state, was among those attending the roadshow. The ambassador leads a departmentwide effort to “position economic and commercial issues more prominently within the U.S. foreign policy landscape” and to “elevate the importance of entrepreneurship, technology and innovation in the State Department’s promotion of global prosperity.”\n\nThorne gave speeches at both the March 3 @America Innovation at Innovation and Entrepreneurship Presentations at Pacific Place in Jakarta, Indonesia and the March 7 Vietnam Ministry of Science and Technology Innovation Conference in Hanoi.\n\nSpeeches given by the ambassador encouraged these countries to adopt blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.\n\nBoth the Vietnam and Indonesia (prepared) remarks included the following similar, if not identical, recommendations:\n\n“…[W]e would like to encourage the development of new financial technology or \'FinTech\' innovations – blockchain and distributed ledgers, mobile banking, etc – which will provide a backbone to the e-commerce activity … These kinds of tools naturally encourage fiscal and business transparency, not just for start-ups but for everyone, which is a key for reducing corruption and improving efficiency.”\n\nBitcoin Blockchain Advances\n\nLast year the White House named Dr. Ed Felten deputy U.S. chief technology officer. Felten was previously the director of the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP) at Princeton University, and is a well regarded Bitcoin researcher.\n\nFelten previously stated in CITP’s “Freedom to Tinker” blog that Bitcoin is “a new kind of thing: a currency whose rules are determined by open-source governance… [and that] governments will find new ways to influence it.”\n\nSince Felten’s appointment, the Bitcoin community has been closely watching the Obama administration’s Bitcoin or “Blockchain Policy” -- or lack of thereof. Back in 2014, the White House was asked at a daily briefing if it was monitoring Bitcoin and had a position on it.\n\nJay Carney, then White House press secretary, said only, “For administration’s position on it, I would refer you to the Treasury Department.”\n\nIn January 2015, the State Department sought a virtual fellow to serve with the Office of Monetary Affairs, Office of International Finance and Development and Bureau of Economics and Business Affairs as digital currency research consultant. According to the posting, “The State Department\'s Office of Monetary Affairs (OMA) is responsible for monitoring developments in global currencies, including digital currencies such as Bitcoin.”\n\nIn January of this year, Bitcoin Vietnam and Coinify announced that they launched the first “blockchain payment processing platform” for Vietnam. In March the Vietnam Ministry of Industry of Trade issued caution against the use of Bitcoin and other altcoins (as reported by The Merkle).\n\nIn May 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that Indonesians began embracing Bitcoin. Tribunnews.com of Jakarta reports that Bitcoin is quite popular in major cities across Indonesia even as the Bank of Indonesia continues to urge caution.\n\nThe American Innovation Roadshow dialog is the clearest signal yet that the Obama administration is not only looking at blockchain technologies favorably, but also proactively advocating its adoption.\n\nPhoto Center for American Progress Action Fund / Ralph Alswang', 'With the halving looming and transaction capacity maxed out, some are predicting a doomsday scenario. Much, therefore, depends on the Lightning Network. A “decentralized network using smart contract functionality in the blockchain to enable instant payments” which is capable of an amazing “millions to billions of transactions per second” according to the Lightning Network’s website.\n\nThe Lightning Network is a fairly old — in bitcoin terms — idea which makes use of bitcoin’s inbuilt script system allowing for trustless payments through intermediaries, but enforceable on the blockchain. In responding to a number of our questions, Eric Lombrozo, who has recently come to prominence as one of the main developers of Segregated Witnesses (Segwit), stated:\n\n“Without 2nd layer networks like Lightning, the Bitcoin network must burden every single full node with every single transaction every single person makes. It’s sort of like if every time you pointed your browser at some page every other computer on the Internet would have to process that same page. The Lightning Network allows routing of messages between machines so that it is not necessary to flood the entire network with every transaction.”\n\nThe Bitcoin network is designed in such a way that every full node has a copy of the entire blockchain which currently stands at 60GB, according to blockchain.info, increasing by 5GB a month or 50GB a year at the current rate of 1MB per approximately 10 minutes. However, some of this space is taken by low-value transactions. After conducting some analysis, Rusty Russel, one of the main developers of the Lightning Network, shared a graph which suggests that 25% of current bitcoin transactions are for less than $1 with around 70,000 daily transactions for less than $5.\n\nMany suggest that these transactions are better performed on the Lightning Network which further opens the opportunity for micro-transactions. Such as paying newspapers by the article, a timely and needed solution considering the increase in Adblock usage.\n\nAlthough concerns have been raised that lightning is a centralized solution as most transactions would occur on the richest, or most secure, or in other ways the best performing “hub” with further concerns raised in regards to a potential lack of privacy, few are against the Lightning Network itself. Gavin Andresen, the Chief Scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation and the main developer of Bitcoin Classic, stated in a forum post in December 2015 that he thinks “Lightning is a fantastic idea and it should happen”. He further echoed the opinion of most, if not all, in the so-called big-blockers camp, in stating that we need both the Lightning Network and onchain scaling.\n\nAfter a year of heated debate, there is wide consensus that Bitcoin’s onchain transaction capacity is to increase. The current position is that the increase is to be deployed through Segwit, a solution architected by Pieter Wuille, one of the five core developers of bitcoin with commit access. It has two main purposes. To solve transaction malleability to make Lightning possible and to increase transaction capacity up to a maximum of 4MB in theory, but around 1.7 to 1.8MB in practice. The question is, however, will it be ready in time and when?\n\nSegwit and Lightning by August?\n\nJoseph Poon, one of the main developers of the Lightning Network stated recently that: “A basic, functional version of Lightning Network should be ready when the Segregated Witness soft-fork goes live on Bitcoin, presuming it gets merged and activated this Summer.”\n\nThe Lightning Network, therefore, is likely to be ready as soon as Segwit is ready. As such, much depends on Segwit, which is currently in its last stages of testing with a block of 1.5mb recently created on the testnet. We asked Eric Lombrozo, one of the main developers of Segwit, the following:\n\nA soft-fork has currently been deployed in version 0.12.1, which cannot activate before the first of May. Segwit will then follow in version 0.12.2 with presumably two or three months for uptake. So is Segwit to go live around August?\n\n“Yes, 0.12.1 contains the soft fork activation code for CSV (CheckSequenceVerify). Everything you say is correct. The last part is still a bit uncertain as our last soft-fork (CheckLockTimeVerify) took less than that to activate, so it’s possible it might go live before although I don’t want to say for sure. It’s not entirely up to us how quickly miners adopt it.”\n\nBitcoin’s mining reward is to drop by 50% on or around the 12th of July 2016. Some have suggested that, due to the current ceiling in transaction capacity, price may be unable to compensate. Thus, perhaps, leading to the more inefficient miners dropping off the network and higher mining centralization. Moreover, in the roundtable agreement signed by many miners and bitcoin developers, on February the 21st 2016, it states “SegWit is expected to be released in April 2016”. However, as a soft fork is in the process of activation in May, we wondered whether Segwit had been delayed.\n\n“[T]he segwit team is very much focused on delivering it ASAP and everything so far is going smoothly. No delays.” – said Lombrozo\n\nSegwit, like the Lightning Network, has wide support with many suggesting that both an increase of the max blocksize and Segwit is the best solution. Indeed, according to the agreement, a hard-fork max-blocksize increase is to activate around July 2017. However, questions have been raised in regards to Segwit’s fee discount and suggestions that it will make onchain scaling more difficult moving forward. Addressing the above, Lombrozo stated:\n\nI believe quite the opposite is true! Segwit will, for instance, allow us to add support for much more efficient signature schemes such as Schnorr which might reduce transaction sizes 30% to 50%, thus giving us another onchain capacity boost.\n\nWe’re also looking into other ideas enabled by segwit such as MASTs (merkelized abstract syntax trees) which allow us to significantly compress long scripts, enabling much more efficient smart contracts onchain.\n\nAs with most things, timing is of the essence. In a recent post, Peter Todd, one of the Bitcoin developers, stated that if Segwit was delayed he would “personally support doing a hard fork that was expected to activate within two or three months” under certain conditions. He further states that:\n\n“[I]f major industry players were willing to make a clear and credible commitment to layer 2 solutions like Lightning that have genuine scaling, without compromising on decentralization, I think it’d be reasonable for developers like myself to be willing to support a higher risk approach to hard-forks, with shorter timelines, as an interim measure to give the industry some breathing room.”\n\nWe asked a few questions to clarify his statement. Specifically, whether he has any reason to suspect “industry players” are not committed to “layer 2 solutions” and whether it would not be far too easy to game “coin voting” by simply endlessly moving your ten btc around, but he has not yet responded to our request for comments.\n\nHowever, Todd’s statements seem to express a general feeling that there is widespread consensus on onchain scaling and, from past statements of Bitcoin Classic developers and supporters there is a general feeling that there is widespread consensus on supporting the Lightning Network. The question is, which goes first, and that very much seems to depend on the very tight timeline of segwit.\n\nIn closing the short interview and in seemingly extending an olive branch Lombrozo stated:\n\n“These are exciting times! Lots of amazing new developments in the technology. I’m hopeful we can finally put behind us the misunderstandings of last year and work together as a community on building the future.”\n\nThose feelings are shared by most. We, as a community, face both threats and opportunities. As blockchain tech is hailed as the solution to everything, Ethereum rises and falls, we stand stronger as one. From a wide gulf in early 2015, wide consensus has now been achieved, with the only remaining question whether maxblocksize is raised first, or segwit. A tiny, immaterial, detail mostly dependent on Segwit’s activation date, which, according to the agreement, is to be released sometime this month.\n\nIt may well be the case, therefore, that bitcoin once more has overcome a great challenge and in the process has become much stronger.\n\nFeatured image from Wikimedia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
04/13/2016,"['Cape Town - While MMM confirmed that its electronic currency Bitcoin exchange had collapsed, South African participants, in what has been dubbed a Ponzi scheme, said they would continue to invest their money, confident they would receive a 30 percent return.\n\nMMM was started by convicted Russian scammer Sergey Mavrodi in the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s. He would replicate the formula in other countries, moving his operation online and eventually launching in South Africa in August last year.\n\nWith news of MMM’s troubles filtering through slowly on Tuesday, a Nigerian who runs the scheme’s office at Cape Town train station said the news did not leave him concerned.\n\n“There’s nothing illegal about it, this is like a stokvel… If you’ve got spare money to invest, you can get 30 percent of that money at the end of 31 days,” he said.\n\nOne participant, Patrick Dilapiso, from Kimberley, defended MMM, saying it was not a Ponzi scheme.\n\n“There’s no fraudulent or criminal activity, there’s no central banking account for the system,” said Dilapiso.\n\nParticipants are encouraged to recruit more people into the MMM system and register their names and cellphone numbers on the scheme’s website.\n\nThose joining are expected to write down their “dreams”, then members of the scheme will deposit money into the individual’s account to “achieve” their dream whenever they wanted to withdraw money from the scheme.\n\n“Before you send money, you can call that person to confirm his account number and then send the proof of payment,” said Dilapiso.\n\nIn February he had “invested” R5 000 into the scheme and said he was hoping to withdraw R170 000 by March next year.\n\nNational Consumer Council spokesperson Trevor Hattingh said the body had conducted an assessment of MMM to see whether there were any contraventions of the Consumer Protection Act.\n\n“We found something, but we’re not going to disclose that… We’re still working with the Hawks. A pyramid scheme (is) fraudulent, fraud is a criminal matter and that can only be investigated by the police,” said Hattingh.\n\nHawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said:\n\n“There is an inquiry that has been opened. We’re having a slight challenge in the fact that the scheme is being run through the internet.\n\n“We’ve enlisted the help of the (police’s) cybercrimes unit and the Financial Intelligence Centre. Another challenge is that we have not received any complaints from the investors. We want to encourage them to come forward.”\n\n[email protected]\n\n@mtyala\n\nCape Times', 'Airbnb has hired a team of engineers from CoinChange, a company that is responsible for ChangeTip. However, no venturing into Bitcoin or Blockchain is on the horizon.\n\nAirbnb spokesperson reveals to CoinTelegraph:\n\n""We are thrilled to bring some members of the ChangeTip team on as a part of Airbnb and joining the engineering team working on building our infrastructure. We are not acquiring the assets of the company, nor do we have any plans to incorporate Bitcoin into the Airbnb ecosystem.”\n\nAirbnb is a company whose business model has been subject to much debate. They have been a game changer in terms of how people stay when they travel. Airbnb began their operations in August of 2008, and the San Francisco based company is already a household name. Airbnb now has accommodations in 34,000 cities spread over 190 countries and they claim to have served over 60 million guests.\n\nWhat started the buzz?\n\nAccording to Business Insider, Airbnb has gone ahead and “acqui-hired” seven engineers from CoinChange, the company that is responsible for ChangeTip.\n\nThis has caused quite a stir and there is talk that Airbnb maybe exploring the use of Bitcoin technology, or at least have an interest in the workings of blockchain and other associated Bitcoin technology.\n\nIt is noteworthy to mention that ChangeTip runs a system that allows users to tip each other with cryptocurrencies on Twitter and Reddit.\n\nSince Airbnb has only acquired staff and none of the infrastructure or assets of CoinChange, there is no reason to believe that they are going to be introducing any tipping service as of now.\n\nData and trust\n\nBy all appearances it seemed that leveraging the power of its data was the main interest of Airbnb, and Airbnb has a lot of data. However, the business that Airbnb is in requires a huge element of trust. We know now though that they may not be headed in that direction.\n\nAirbnb hosting involves giving your house to a stranger and for the guest. It means staying in a strange environment potentially with other strangers.\n\nInterestingly, the focus of trust when it comes to data is made clear by the Airbnb blog which says:\n\n“How best to support trust — particularly between groups of people who may not have the opportunity to interact with each other on a daily basis — is a core research topic for our data science and experience research teams.”\n\nQuest for trusted form of digital identity\n\nBlockchain, the technology on which Bitcoin operates can be theoretically useful for Airbnb because it can be used to create a “trusted form of digital identity”.\n\nImagine a world in which Airbnb could leverage its huge record of users, and share this data in some form with partners. In this way a partner company would have been able to check on the digital reputation of an Airbnb guest for example and see if they are willing to extend their services to this user.\n\nIt is clear that they have no such plans, at least officially.\n\nThere are, however, challenges in this area as there is the question of privacy and security.\n\nMarcus Andrade, the CEO of Aten Group, LTD a London based company, says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“We believe the added value of blockchain technology is one of the key factors in ensuring digital identities are secure. This is why we have filed patents pertaining to systems and methods for providing blockchain-based multifactor personal identity verification”.\n\nProspectives and limitations\n\nThere are many applications of a verifiable digital identity.\n\nCompanies can share data about their customers with each other, governments can utilise information about citizens to know who exactly they are and even citizens can use these sort of services to validate each other.\n\nAs an example if you were potential tenant, your landlord could utilise a private blockchain or a public one to see what sort of history you have with respect to accommodations where you previously dwelled. However there are limitations and we cannot overextend the blockchain for everything.\n\nDavid Duccini, Executive Director of Strength in Numbers Foundation — a non-profit digital trust, explains:\n\n“I think anyone can take their Big Data and turn it into a blockchain. But will it have any value? That is the question.”\n\nAs of now that question remains unanswered.', 'One of the largest bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, Kraken, has announced an investment from a leading Japanese foreign exchange brokerage, in the exchange’s Series B round of financing.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Kraken has announced an investment from Tokyo-based Money Partners Group as a part of its Series B round of financing, in a press release today.\n\nMoney Partners Group holds a market cap of over $260 million and is among the leading foreign exchange brokerages in Japan with over 270,000 client networks. The terms of the investment were not disclosed.\n\nThis would mark the second investment from a Japanese firm in Kraken’s Series B round of financing after the exchange revealed a “multi-million dollar agreement” with Japan’s leading venture capital firm SBI Investment in Feb 2016.\n\nBitcoin & Ethereum Makes Gains\n\nBeyond its investment with Kraken, Money Partners Group has also announced a business alliance which the cryptocurrency exchange.

The results we will achieve together will show other financial institutions why they should embrace digital assets and blockchain technologies.\n\nKraken – A Monster Like its Namesake\n\nKraken became one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world following its acquisition of North American bitcoin exchanges Coinsetter and CavirtEx, earlier in January 2016. The acquisitions directly led to Kraken’s expansion in the North American continent, gaining a foothold in the United States and Canada through the two exchanges existing presence.\n\nKraken has revealed that it has seen a 4x rise in new client accounts following its expansion into North America, compared to new accounts Q4 2015.\n\nThe exchange also revealed the following figures in its press release:\n\n10x increase in Bitcoin-USD swaps, i.e. XBT/USD\n\n30x increase in Bitcoin-Canadian Dollar swaps, XBT/CAD.\n\n15x increase in Bitcoin-Japanese Yen swaps, XBT/JPY.\n\n5x increase in Bitcoin-Sterling Pound swaps, XBT/GBP.\n\nEthereum trading had also increased 5x in Q1 2016.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Former New York state financial services chief Benjamin Lawsky may have taken a harsh view of virtual currency as a regulator, but he has begun to stump for the technology behind it.\n\nThe man accused of implementing tough regulations on Bitcoins and other online currency now heads a consultancy that is acting as an adviser and media liaison for one of the sector’s major new players.\n\nThe Lawsky Group, which provides legal and strategic counsel for clients on financial regulation issues, was the press contact last week for Axoni, a blockchain technology firm.\n\nAxoni was promoting its successful test of blockchain technology into the back office settlement process for derivatives transactions.\n\n“We’ll be doing a broad range of financial consultancy … and some financial technology public relations,” said Lawsky Group spokesman Matthew Anderson.\n\nAnderson was spokesman for the Department of Financial Services, the state regulator where Lawsky was accused of slowing the development of virtual currencies.\n\nLawsky said last June he wanted to “put in place guard rails that protect consumers and root out illicit activity without stifling beneficial innovation”.\n\nThough some Bitcoin proponents welcomed the safeguards, Lawsky’s about-face now that he is profiting from the technology in the private sector has miffed more than a few observers.\n\n“I think the most interesting thing about Mr Lawsky’s newest venture is that it highlights the cozy relationship between regulators and the regulated industry,” Pamela Morgan, CEO of Third Key Solutions, told IFR.\n\nMorgan, whose company consults for other companies that use digital currencies such as Bitcoin, called Lawsky’s new role “crony capitalism at its finest”.\n\nLawsky’s spokesman did not respond to two requests for further detail about his work, though others saw no problem with it.\n\n“I think it is fantastic that he has entered the private sector and continued to support the Bitcoin/blockchain space,” said Adam Draper, CEO of Boost VC, a venture capital firm focused on blockchain and other virtual technologies.\n\nSome suggest the addition of public relations brings out a strength that helped raise Lawsky’s profile in the first place – his ability to interact with the media.', 'One of Donald Trump’s many campaign promises if he is elected President of the United States is a tall wall along the Mexico-U.S. border.

While there is lots of talk about the future of Bitcoin’s underlying technology, we need to find ways to demonstrate that Bitcoin can already be useful today,” he added.\n\nAnd so it is, already. Bitcoin can be used for remittance beyond borders. Without excessive regulation and oversight. With or without Donald Trump’s wall.\n\nImages from Genesis Mining.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Comptroller of the Currency Thomas J. Curry, who heads an independent department in charge of supervising all U.S. national banks, stated in a speech April 7 at the American Banker Retail Banking Conference that “it’s important that regulators are open to the changes that are underway in both technology and business practices,” according to prepared remarks shared with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThe comptroller signalled a shift in attitudes toward fintech regulations, an umbrella term used to describe companies or services that use a combination of finance and technology, with Bitcoin being the most prominent example.\n\nAnnouncing a number of new initiatives, such as “innovator fairs” that aim to bring banks and nonbank innovators together with OCC experts, and the sponsorship of a forum on responsible innovation to be held in Washington on June 23, Curry made it clear that “[T]he Office of the Comptroller of the Currency [OCC] want[s] to support efforts by federal banks to innovate.” He added, “But we also want to be sure that they do so in a responsible way that doesn’t threaten the safety of the system or the financial well-being of bank customers.”\n\nIn his more striking remarks the comptroller stated:\n\n“[I]t’s not unreasonable to characterize the change underway in the financial marketplace as revolutionary. But purists might point out that real revolutions sweep away existing institutions. That hasn’t happened,” he said, but warned: “without change, banks could go the way of other businesses that failed to adapt to changing times.”\n\nIn potentially historic closing remarks Curry stated:\n\n“If there is a revolution underway in financial services ... those of you in retail banking are on the frontlines. What I want you to know is that the OCC is ready to support you as you engage in the kind of responsible innovation that serves the needs of all financial consumers and makes our financial system stronger than ever.”\n\nOCC is being hailed as the appropriate regulatory body to oversee an overhaul of outdated financial regulations, some as old as a century, to adapt to the changing needs of the 21st century and, in particular, to foster a welcoming environment for fintech innovation.\n\nThe remarks signal an overall change in attitude of both banks and regulators toward fintech just as London is declared the financial capital of the world for the second year running, beating New York by only 8 points out of 1,000 primarily because of London’s vibrant fintech sector.\n\nBritish regulators have introduced fintech’s “most progressive, forward-looking regulatory regime” in the world, according to city minister and economic secretary to the U.K. Treasury Harriett Baldwin. She was commenting on the recent announcement of an unprecedented partnership between Barclays and Circle. U.S. regulators have noticed and they are now loudly asking for a shift in the way fintech companies are regulated.\n\nThe debate was opened by CFTC’s Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo, who hailed the benefits of blockchain and called for a light-touch regulatory approach similar to the strategy employed in the early days of the Internet. He made the remarks in a special address to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation 2016 Blockchain Symposium last week.\n\n“[A] dramatic example of the potential benefits to regulators of blockchain technology is in the collapse of Lehman Brothers,” Giancarlo said.\n\nSince then, the OCC issued a white paper calling for comments and suggestions on how to regulate “responsible innovation.” In opening remarks about the white paper, Curry stated:\n\n“[R]apid and dramatic advances in financial technology are beginning to disrupt the way traditional banks do business. … At the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), we are making certain that institutions with federal charters have a regulatory framework that is receptive to responsible innovation along with the supervision that supports it.”\n\nMeanwhile, London races ahead. In a speech at Money 20/20 Europe, Hannah Nixon, managing director of U.K.’s Payment Systems Regulator, a first-of-its-kind independent regulator, highlighted Britain’s enthusiasm for financial innovation in stating:\n\n“[W]e want to encourage technological innovation. Not for innovation’s sake, but to drive improvements for users, helping payment companies find new and ever more convenient ways for people to pay.\n\n“In fact, we want the U.K. industry to become a center of innovation, to lead the world in the development of payment systems. And I believe the PSR can play a major part in that.\n\n“We want people to look at U.K. payment systems and the PSR, and say, ‘We want to do it like that.’”\n\nThey have so far succeeded; consultancy firm Ernst & Young recently crowned London the ""Fintech Capital of the World."" Moreover, while British banks earned a reputation in the Bitcoin community for being notoriously against granting bank accounts to Bitcoin and other digital-currency-related businesses, that too seems to be changing. The shift in attitude may be, in part, due to PSR.\n\nEchoing criticisms often expressed in the Bitcoin community, Nixon stated:\n\n“The evidence we gathered showed that wider financial crime regulations may be causing people to be overcautious about doing business with a third party.”\n\nAlthough she warns that “we would need to show our teeth from time to time,” she states that PSR “won’t be taking direct action” because PSR is aware a number of banks are “planning to start offering indirect access or expand their current services.” One such bank may be Barclays which, in an unprecedented move, partnered with Circle.\n\n“Historically, obtaining U.K. banking has been challenging for U.K. Bitcoin companies; however recent events show that this situation is beginning to change,” Obi Nwosu, managing director at Coinfloor, a British-based Bitcoin exchange, stated in an email.\n\nThe winds of change are, therefore, once again in the air. As more than $20 billion has been invested globally in fintech, and investment in Bitcoin companies saw its second best quarter ever in the first quarter of 2016, it is perhaps time to repeat the remarks of George Osborn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, in a speech in 2014 declared: “We stand at the dawn of a new era in banking.”\n\nPhoto MBisanz / Flickr(CC)', 'The Lightning Network is viewed by many as a serious improvement for Bitcoin in terms of scalability, but there are still plenty of critics of the system who do not believe it is destined for success. During a recent event at the Coinbase offices in San Francisco, Lightning Network co-creators Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja answered some questions about potential weaknesses of this generalized network for payment channels.\n\nOne of the key criticisms Dryja and Poon attempted to debunk during the event was that bitcoins are essentially “tied-up” once they enter the Lightning Network. Poon was the first of the duo to respond to this potentially negative aspect of the network. He stated, “It’s not necessarily tied up in the sense that they can [still] spend it.”\n\nBitcoins on the Lightning Network are Useful\n\nDryja took Poon’s point to another level by pointing out that, in certain situations, bitcoins on the Lightning Network may actually be more useful than those on the Bitcoin blockchain. Dryja explained:\n\n“It is tied up, as in it’s in this channel, but the thing is, having funds in channels that are on this network might be more useful than having a non-Lightning bitcoin because you can push it anywhere instantly.”\n\nWhile on-chain transactions require confirmations before they’re considered secure, transactions on the Lightning Network are essentially settled instantly. According to Dryja and Poon, on-chain transactions are also expected to be much more expensive than Lightning transactions once the system goes live.\n\nThe belief that funds are tied up on the Lightning Network comes from a misunderstanding of how the system works. In the past, some have wondered whether opening a payment channel with Uber would be useful if you don’t use that particular car service often. This misses the point that the Lightning Network is a generalized platform for payment channels, which means users are able to route payments to practically anyone else on the network.\n\nDryja used the Uber example to make this point:\n\n“Customer opens a channel with Coinbase and then Coinbase has a channel open with Uber, and so when they want to pay Uber, they just say, ‘Hey, Coinbase. Please forward this to Uber.’ One channel is enough to pay everyone, really.”\n\nA user on the Lightning Network needs only to open up a channel with one other user to gain access to millions of others. However, the vision is that users will have multiple channels open by default to gain access to the entire network.\n\nWhen Are Your Funds Actually Locked Up?\n\nAlthough funds aren’t necessarily tied-up all the time on the Lightning Network, there are still instances where things can go wrong (though not completely wrong).\n\nPoon explained:\n\n“The only situation where there is this structure where it feels locked up is if your channel counterparty is not really online all that much or doesn’t want to route, which is why there is that cost if you want to be a ‘hub’ ? because you’re likely to get more of those types of users. It is costly to be that, and that’s why there is that disincentive to operate in that way.”\n\nIn other words, if someone who is supposed to be routing payments for you decides they don’t want to do that anymore, they can deny your ability to send transactions on the Lightning Network. This would force you to close the channel, which could lock up your funds for a period of time. As Poon mentioned, there is a disincentive to act this way because you have to make some bitcoins available on the network to be able to route payments in the first place.\n\nHow Coinbase Can Help in the Early Days\n\nPoon also talked about how Coinbase can help with user adoption of the Lightning Network in the early days. He noted that funds on the Lightning Network can be used to make on-blockchain transactions ? albeit with the help of a third party.\n\nPoon explained:\n\n“You make the payment inside Lightning. You send it to Coinbase, and then Coinbase makes the on-chain transaction on their behalf. What happens is, at that point, the user is trusting Coinbase to some marginal level.”\n\nPoon added that this sort of functionality would be helpful during the early days of the network when not everyone is already on board. He also stated that Coinbase would be well-suited to act as a bridge between the Lightning Network and the blockchain during this period of time. The only limitation with this setup is that doing extremely low-value “dust” transfers from the Lightning Network to the blockchain would not work.\n\nUpdate: This article has been modified from its original version to clarify that the vision for the Lightning Network is to have each user open multiple channels to gain access to the entire network.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

NewsBTC is not responsible for the accuracy of any of the information supplied in Sponsored Stories/Press Releases such as this one.', 'When I started writing about Bitcoin in these pages, I set out to do so from the perspective of a trader; that is, after all, my background. The more I learned about the concept behind the virtual currency, however, the less important the price at any given moment seemed. Far more important than price were the potential for the currency to change the way we thought about money, and for the blockchain system behind it to do the same with regard to transactions and record keeping.\n\nThere was value way beyond price.\n\nIn the couple of years since then, the currency and technology behind it have increasingly been viewed by many as separate things, but interest in both has continued to grow. From the perspective of the currency, however, one thing stood in the way of much wider acceptance: volatility. For Bitcoin to truly become a force in global terms, wild swings in value as compared to other currencies had to slow.\n\nAs I have pointed out a few times, when and if that happened it would make sense for some of the corporations that have decided to accept Bitcoin in payment to change their current policy of immediately exchanging the coin for Dollars or other conventional currency. Most multinationals keep funds in multiple currencies and there is no reason that Bitcoin should not be one of them. Well, actually there has been a reason.\n\nThe kind of volatility that we saw last year, when bitcoin’s value in dollar terms (BTC/USD) ranged between $200 and $450 makes it impossible for companies to hold Bitcoin with any degree of confidence.\n\nTake a look at the last two months, however, and a very different picture emerges.\n\nDuring that time BTC/USD has essentially traded in a $400-$440 range, with the last month or so being bounded by $415-$425. Now it is obviously a little early to get too excited about that, but it does look good. As anybody with chart reading experience will tell you, the longer a pattern like this, which is essentially a rising, narrowing channel, continues the more it tends to dampen future volatility.\n\nThis is not, as is often the case with technical analysis, the product of some arcane numerical relationship, but rather of plain old common sense. A narrowing pattern such as this cannot go on forever; at some point a breakout is inevitable. Over time, though, each previous high and low becomes a technical point of resistance and support, so when the breakout comes it has some pretty severe obstacles in the way of violent swings such as we saw in bitcoin as recently as a year ago.\n\nThe pattern in the three month chart above, of gradual increases in a narrowing range is one of the most bullish there is for the long term prospects of a stock, commodity or anything traded. It hints at increasing underlying value, something that is built into Bitcoin by continued reductions in the rate of, and ultimately the finite nature of, supply. Some of the strength is undoubtedly as a result of general dollar weakness (the Dollar index is down about 5 percent since the start of the year), but it is the orderly, somewhat boring reaction to that that is the biggest plus.\n\nThe optimism that I and others feel about Bitcoin and the base case for why the currency should be a small part of every serious investor’s portfolio rest on that gradual increase in relative value. The three month chart for BTC/USD suggests that that dynamic, rather than headline and fear driven trading, is controlling moves in Bitcoin. It is, therefore, the best looking chart there is for those of us that believe in the currency.']"
04/14/2016,"['', 'Ransomware authors are using the bitcoin blockchain, which serves as the cryptocurrency\'s public transaction ledger, to deliver decryption keys to victims.\n\nThe technique, which removes the burden of maintaining a reliable website-based infrastructure for cybercriminals, was observed in a recent version of the CTB-Locker ransomware that targets Web servers.\n\nCTB-Locker has targeted Windows computers for a long time, but a PHP-based variant capable of infecting websites first appeared in February, marking an interesting evolution of this ransomware threat.\n\nThe decryption routine in the original PHP-based CTB-Locker version involved a script called access.php that served as a gateway to the attackers\' back-end server. This gateway script was hosted on multiple hacked websites and was necessary to obtain the decryption key after victims made a payment.\n\nThe approach was not reliable, according to researchers from Web security firm Sucuri, because those hacked websites could be cleaned by their owners. Constantly updating the list of gateways used by the malware was probably a hassle for the criminals.\n\nBecause of that, CTB-Locker\'s creators came up with a new approach: using the bitcoin blockchain itself to deliver the decryption keys. This new behavior was observed by Sucuri\'s researchers in a CTB-Locker version released in March.\n\nThe technique relies on a field called OP_RETURN that was introduced in the Bitcoin protocol in 2014 to allow transactions to hold arbitrary bits of text, or metadata.\n\nThe new CTB-Locker variant generates a unique bitcoin wallet address for every infection. Once the victim pays the ransom by sending the required amount of bitcoins to that address, the attackers generate a new bogus transaction from that same wallet to which they append the encryption key in the OP_RETURN field.\n\nThe transaction is not validated in the bitcoin system, but it does get recorded in the blockchain and can be viewed through websites like blockexplorer.com and blockchain.info.\n\nThe CTB-Locker script uses the blockexlorer.com API to check the transaction history for the wallet corresponding to the infection and extracts the decryption key from the bogus transaction once the payment has been made.\n\n""So, instead of using unreliable gates on third-party hacked sites, the March version of the CTB-Locker reads the keys directly from public and much more reliable blockchain information services,"" the Sucuri researchers said in a blog post. ""That’s the beauty of Bitcoin transactions -- everything is public and transparent, and at the same time it’s possible to keep things anonymous and not traceable to real IPs.""\n\nThere are many applications that can benefit from distributed, tamper-proof systems like the blockchain, which is why the technology is being adopted by banks and other industries. Security researchers also demonstrated last year that the bitcoin blockchain can be abused by malware authors to store malicious code or commands, and the idea seems to be catching on.', 'The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) recently released its latest Theatrical Market Statistics Report, revealing that global box office revenues reached US$38.3b in 2015, up 5% on 2014. The United States and Canada generated US$11.1b, while international box office revenues hit US$27.2b.\n\nDespite the impressive growth, piracy is still an issue. During his keynote speech at CinemaCon in April, Chris Dodd, Chief of the MPAA, stated that tackling the issue would add a healthy US$1.5b to the movie industry’s bottom line.\n\nChristine Peterson, Director for Intellectual Property and Innovation at the MPAA, also addressed the issue, in a request for public comment last October: “Online content theft continues to pose a significant and ever-evolving challenge. Content thieves take advantage of a wide constellation of easy-to-use online technologies, such as direct download and streaming, to create sites and applications with the look and feel of legitimate content distributors.”\n\nDirect downloads predominantly take place on peer-to-peer networks (P2P), which were popularised in 1999 by the file sharing platform Napster. Although they can be used for legitimate purposes, they have been subject to scrutiny, and involved in numerous legal cases surrounding copyright law. Movies, songs, art and many other forms of creative expression have been shared on these networks.\n\nIn 2014, the Wolf of Wall Street grossed US$392,000, but was downloaded over 30 million times. The top ten downloaded movies last year all cracked 30 million downloads. Interstellar brought in $675,120,017 at the box office, and was downloaded 47 million times.\n\nPiracy detection services are available, for those who can pay a price. Excipio uses technology to detect copyright infringements that are permissible in court. “The NARS (Network Recording and Supervision) software we use for detection has been completely redeveloped by specialists who have many years of experience in the field of detecting copyright infringements on the Internet. In particular the forensic experience gained from numerous court cases.”\n\nWhile a company such as Excipio may have the technology to track torrents, the method of peer-to-peer distribution is not an illegal mode of exchange in itself. As a result, piracy tracking companies need to ensure that what they are tracking is in fact an illegal copy and not considered to be under the Fair Use Policy.\n\nThe industry also has to contend with sites that host content, or sites that aggregate links to content. These sites attract customers who want to anonymously download and/or stream copyright infringing files. Uploaders are attracted to these sites as there is a profit to be made. NowVideo, for example, pays approximately US$20 per thousand views for uploaded content.\n\nAccording to a report compiled by NetNames and Digital Citizens Alliance, 30 direct download and streaming sites took in close to $100million in total annual revenue last year, and generated average profit margins of 63 to 88 percent, from a mix of advertising and subscription.\n\nCustos Media Technologies, a startup based in Stellenbosch, South Africa, is tackling the problem from a different angle, by using the bitcoin blockchain. Custos embeds watermarks into the digital content, which are subtle and difficult to remove. If the content is leaked by the intended recipient, typically a reviewer offered a pre-released version of a movie, there is a small bitcoin reward that can be collected by the first person to find it.\n\n- Custos\n\nWhen a media downloader, or bounty hunter, claims the bitcoin in a Custos watermark the transaction can be seen on the blockchain in around 10 minutes, and Custos will then be able to notify the media provider.\n\nAs a result, the original source of the content could then be subject to legal penalties, or lose their access to any future content. “In this manner, authorised media users are strongly discouraged from actively sharing files or carelessly leaking them, while at the same time, they need not be inconvenienced by cumbersome security measures,” states Custos.\n\nIf caught, and proven guilty, the punishment for facilitating downloading stolen content is hefty. It can cost up to five years in jail and/or fines of up to US$150,000 per file.\n\n- Custos\n\nThe Custos solution received a top-five prize from the competition SeedStars World last year, as well as US$140,000 in funding from rom Innovus, the Technology Transfer Office of Stellenbosch University, where the product was conceptualised.\n\nThe company recently completed a second-round seed investment of just under US$265,000, part of which came from Digital Currency Group (DCG), based in New York. “We are excited to see the Custos team developing an innovative application of bitcoin technology to solve a problem that is very costly to content producers,” said Barry Silbert, Founder and CEO at Digital Currency Group.\n\nThe company is now primed to focus on high-risk media producers “for whom piracy can literally cut tens of millions of dollars from their production budget when a title is leaked,” states Custos. The product offering will also be expanded to independent movie producers, a market that Fred Lutz, Custos COO, believes is particularly susceptible to theft. “A pirate leak can make the difference between being able to pay their employees and going bankrupt.”', ""One nonprofit organization is going above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to empowering underprivileged women in Afghanistan.\n\nCode to Inspire (CTI), led by founder Fereshteh Forough, started an after-school program in January 2015 followed in November of the same year by the opening of its first coding school for girls in Herat, Afghanistan. Forough's aim was to empower half of the Afghanistan population through education to improve the economy, while putting underserved women on a path to financial independence.\n\nCurrently providing a safe educational environment for 50 female students aged 15-25, Code to Inspire is helping change the way women are seen in a country where women face barriers among conservative families and extremists.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Forough said it can be challenging to work in an environment where women are not encouraged to receive the same education as their male counterparts.\n\n“Girls in Afghanistan lack safe places to study and learn. Girls in Afghanistan lack employment opportunities, specifically in technology,” she said. “Only 16 percent of Afghan women are employed while 2014 saw only 20 percent of public universities taking in female students.”\n\nIn a bid to bridge the gap between female and male education, Code to Inspire’s goal is to improve women’s economic and social advancement in Afghanistan’s growing tech industry. By offering courses in coding, access to technology and professional resources in addition to job placement, CTI students have a greater chance of attaining employment that is both financially rewarding and socially accessible.\n\n“Access to the wealth of the global technology economy enables CTI students to add unique value to their households and their communities, and to challenge the traditional gender roles in Afghanistan with the best argument out there--results,” said Forough.\n\nIn a part of the world which has islands of human population separated by forbidding terrain, where safety and security make it impossible for women to travel, and where wired Internet isn’t common, phone coverage is the next best thing. So much so, that according to recent statistics from Afghanistan’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, more than 89 percent of the population has telecom coverage with 23.2 million phone users in the country out of Afghanistan’s population of around 33 million.\n\nNot only that, but 51 companies have been issued licenses to provide Internet services while around 3 million people (10 percent of the country’s population) have access to the Internet.\n\nThe Internet's universal accessibility allows women the opportunity to work from home; however, in order to do so they have to be able to offer something to potential employers, which is where Code to Inspire is making a positive change.\n\n“In areas where women’s travel can be heavily restricted, the ability to work remotely is a key tool in the push for equality,” said Forough.\n\nConsidering that CTI has only been around since 2015, it has managed to receive funding and donations through individuals and corporate donors who believe in its mission to help the women in Afghanistan.\n\n“Last summer, CTI did its first online crowdfunding through Indiegogo where we raised $22,000,” said Forough. “We’ve also received donations from Github, Malala Fund, GooglersGive program, BitFury, and 20 laptops from Overstock.”\n\nUsing Bitcoin for Financial Freedom\n\nOf course, once the women graduate and find jobs through the Internet there is still the issue of how they get paid.\n\nIn Afghanistan payment processing can be quite difficult. PayPal does not operate in Afghanistan, and while Western Union is available, its fees are very costly. Forough said that to deal with the issue of payment CTI turned its attention to Bitcoin.\n\n“With my former foundation Digital Citizen Fund, we used to pay our content providers in Afghanistan through our corporate partner BitLanders, which was formerly known as Film Annex, in U.S. dollars,” she said. “The majority of users were girls who were too young to have a bank account or they were unbanked, so to make the payment process faster and more reliable, with lower fees per transaction, we switched to paying our users in Bitcoin.”\n\nThe use of Bitcoin is an important initiative for Code to Inspire, as it provides women in developing countries with a powerful tool that enables them to connect quickly and affordably with the global economy.\n\nNot only are women in Afghanistan gaining access to an education, but where it is taboo for women to step out of their doors unattended, Bitcoin allows them to fully participate in the world.\n\nCode to Inspire’s objective is financial inclusion, which is not just about having a bank account. For an economy to be inclusive, women need equal access to opportunity, which is where the nonprofit is making headway.\n\n“What social media did for communication, cryptocurrency promises to do for women’s autonomy. In a society that lacks banks, blockchain technology like Bitcoin offers a secure, transparent way to add value,” said Forough. “Most importantly, it affords those marginalized by the brick-and-mortar finance system a chance to participate in the economy on their own terms.”\n\nWhile it is easy for women in Afghanistan to sign up to access Bitcoin, Forough notes that there are challenges within the country that make it difficult for people to embrace digital currencies.\n\n“There is no platform that can support converting Bitcoin to Afghanistan’s currency,” she said.\n\nThis, however, seems to be a minor issue considering the massive strides that Afghanistan has made for gender equality over the past 15 years. Once women were barred from receiving an education, working outside the home or even dressing as they saw fit.\n\nDuring the Taliban regime there were only 900,000 male students in the country; however, this has now increased to 9 million students including 4.2 million females. Additionally, during the 2014 elections, 40 percent of those who voted were women; and four out of 25 cabinet ministers are now women.\n\n“Thanks to recent technological innovations it doesn’t matter where you are located as long as you can access the Internet,” said Forough. “If you combine education with technology, students will be more innovative and productive so they can access the most up-to-date information and be inspired by the achievements of others.”\n\nThe most important thing for Forough is that by working online and getting paid online, the women can become financially independent, a goal that Code to Inspire continues to accomplish."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The team behind IPFS is creating a peer-to-peer file system that can be accessed by all of the computing devices in the world. The brains behind this new protocol, Stanford graduate Juan Benet, has said that IPFS allows people to create websites and web apps with no central server. He added, “They can be distributed just like the Bitcoin network is distributed.”\n\nWhat Are the Advantages of IPFS for OpenBazaar?\n\nSince OpenBazaar is a marketplace with no central server, IPFS appears to be a solid option for hosting storefronts.\n\nPacia agrees with this sentiment. He told Bitcoin Magazine, “The main advantage is data will become more distributed and most of it should be viewable even if the originating node is offline.”\n\nPacia went on to describe the current issues with OpenBazaar when it comes to opening and operating a store on the network:\n\n“We have a situation now where you have to fetch store data from only one person, and if they have a slow or buggy connection (or if they get attacked), then you can't access that data, despite potentially hundreds of other users having that data from a previous download.”\n\nEssentially, IPFS will allow OpenBazaar users to connect to specific stores via many other peers who already have that data rather than just the owner of the store.\n\nPacia continued:\n\n“So IPFS seeds everything you download which makes the data much more permanent. It also provides a more robust DHT implementation than what we have written, and it's better to spend our resources collaborating than trying to maintain our own.”\n\nMany early users of OpenBazaar have complained about having to operate a server 24/7 to keep their stores “open” on the network, which is why the removal of this requirement has been a top priority for the development team behind the project.\n\nLayering Anonymity on Top\n\nOther commentators have wondered whether Freenet may be the best option for OpenBazaar, but it appears the network’s developers have no intention of going in that direction at this time. Pacia noted, “I don't know [enough] about Freenet to comment on it. But what attracts us to IPFS is its scalable approach to data replication.”\n\nAlthough OpenBazaar launched without native support for anonymizing networks such as i2p or Tor, OpenBazaar project lead Brian Hoffman recently reiterated the development team’s dedication to privacy.\n\n“Anonymity can be layered on top of [IPFS],” Pacia told Bitcoin Magazine. “It won't be too much work to enable onion nodes to connect to each other.”\n\nOpenBazaar’s support for IPFS is not strictly theoretical, as code related to this change is already available on GitHub.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

These include system interoperability, payments, settlement, trade finance, corporate bonds, repos, swaps, and insurance.\n\nThe conference drew a crowd of about 50 regulators, product developers, law enforcement lawyers and other finance industry representatives.\n\nJacob Farber, general counsel for R3, told attendees:\n\n""We have groups of financial institutions engaged in proof of concepts or working on scoping the proof of concept in each of those areas""\n\nThe comments come after R3 revealed its plans for Corda, a distributed ledger designed with an eye to the specific privacy requirements unique to financial institutions.\n\nDisruption, not replacement\n\nFarber, who previously worked at law firm Perkins Coie – which co-chaired the conference along with American Express – emphasized that the projects in these areas were not intended to replace the entire category in any instance.\n\nInstead, the PoCs will take subsets of the services and try to write them into its distributed ledger.\n\nSpecifically, Farber mentioned post-trade reporting, reference data, and regulatory data provision as especially intriguing applications.\n\n""There’s all sorts of interesting applications on blockchain that are well short of replacing the whole cradle to grave process,"" said Farber.\n\n""Smart contracts""\n\nIn other remarks, Farber took issue with the term “smart contracts,” used to describe legal agreements enshrined into a blockchain, codifying certain obligations that are triggered once a predetermined set of events takes place.\n\nFarber said:\n\n""People call it smart contracts. It’s a name I hate, because they’re not really contracts [and] they’re not really smart.""\n\nSimilarly, in a panel on the subject the previous day, Patrick Murck, fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society and former executive director of the bitcoin industry trade group the Bitcoin Foundation, said he “chafes” at the term, coined by Nick Szabo in 1997.\n\nMurck offered the alternative “programmatic transactions”, explaining that the contracts almost always have a traditional counterpart contract, and are only mechanical implementations that are already possible using more traditional technology.\n\nToday was the last day of the two-day conference hosted by the American Conference Institute that spanned a wide range of topics from law enforcement to the position of regulators in the blockchain space to the nature of smart contracts.\n\nImage by Michael del Castillo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But how this makes the controversial figure a disputed messenger of Bitcoin? Let's check out:\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about Donald Trump and his plans to build a physical wall around Mexico. This plan would be set in motion to prevent remittance solutions originating in the US, and coerce the Mexican government into paying for this wall in the end. But Bitcoin will quickly sneak around this border, making Trump’s plan seem ever more silly than it was in the first place.\n\nAlso read: Shapeshift Update: Security Breach Could be an Inside Job\n\nDonald Trump, Remittance, and Bitcoin\n\nFor a Presidential candidate, issuing statements such as “building a wall between the US and Mexico and halting remittance transfers” do not go over well with the general population. As ludicrous as this plan sounds, Donald Trump would like nothing more than go ahead with this plan and ensure the Mexican government picks up the tab for this project as well. After all, halting this remittance corridor would be more expensive for the Latin American country than paying for the wall’s construction.\n\nMany people have pointed out the many flaws in this plan, as Donald Trump seems clueless as to how remittance solutions work. Moreover, he is ignoring the Mexicans working in the US and sending money back home, as they would be punished for being law abiding citizens as well.\n\nNeedless to say, this ridiculous proposal by Donald Trump is cause for much excitement in the Bitcoin world. Genesis Mining, one of the industry’s leading [cloud] mining companies, has been having a blast with pointing out how Bitcoin would circumvent any remittance walls as the digital currency cannot be stopped. No one in the world has any power over Bitcoin, and banks nor governments can do anything about this concept.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin holds a lot of promise for the remittance sector on a global scale, some challenges need to be overcome. Converting the funds to fiat currency will be a significant hurdle in Mexico, as the number of ATMs in the whole country is limited to just three. Then again, this figure could easily go up when a few like-minded entrepreneurs come up with a strategy.\n\nUntil that happens, Genesis Mining seems content on continuing their poster campaign. However, it is important to keep in mind the mining company is not here to pick sides, as they just want to raise awareness for Bitcoin as a use case in the remittance sector. Donald Trump ought to start thinking twice before getting involved in the financial industry, as he needs to learn a thing or two by the look of things.\n\nSource: IB Times\n\nHeader image courtesy of GigaOm"", 'South Africa – Thousands of MMM Global participants across the country are anxious about losing their investments following the network’s announcement last week that it was shutting down one of its schemes, known as the Republic of Bitcoin (RB).\n\nMMM Global, which describes itself as a social financial network, announced on its Facebook page on Saturday that the RB, which offered monthly returns of 100%, was an experiment and it failed. “We regret to inform you that we have to close down the Republic of Bitcoin. It was an experiment, and, unfortunately, it failed. We turned out not to able to pay 100% per month,” MMM wrote.\n\nFollowing this announcement, several news outlets reported that the MMM Global Ponzi scheme had collapsed, giving the impression that all its programmes had closed. However, it appears that this is not the case. Apparently, only the RB was closed. The other programme, which pays 30% monthly, is still being offered. A number of South Africans participating in it said it was business as usual for them.\n\nHowever, the shutdown of the Republic of Bitcoin may be a harbinger of the collapse of the MMM network in its entirety in the near future. According to financial experts, MMM’s business model resembles that of a classic Ponzi scheme, and Ponzi schemes always collapse at some point.\n\nAccording to the Consumer Protection Act, it is against the law to participate in a Ponzi scheme, which is described as any investment scheme that promises returns at least 20% above the repo rate (7%). Despite this, MMM members continue to defend and vouch for the scheme, saying it is not illegal.\n\nThe South African branch of MMM is currently being investigated by the Hawks.\n\nAd: Play online casino games using bitcoins and win real money, find out more information on http://bitcoincasino.best/.', ""Segregated Witness has entered its final testing stage before roll-out on the Bitcoin network. That is good news, most importantly because the innovation introduces a capacity increase to allow for more transactions on the network, while it also solves transaction malleability.\n\nAnd, it introduces script versioning ? an extension to the Bitcoin protocol that allows for an entire new category of innovation.\n\nOne of these imminent innovations has been on the top of several Bitcoin developers’ wish-lists for some time: Schnorr signatures.\n\nWith the impending release of Segregated Witness, implementation of the Schnorr cryptographic signature algorithm might follow soon after, potentially improving Bitcoin's scalability, efficiency and privacy, all in one go.\n\nHere's how.\n\nSignatures\n\nFirst, a brief re-cap: what are signatures?\n\nAt the heart of Bitcoin lies the mathematical trick called “public key cryptography,” a cryptographic system that uses two kinds of “keys” (really strings of numbers): private keys and public keys.\n\nA private key and a public key are mathematically linked. But while it's very easy to produce a public key from a private key, it's practically impossible to produce the private key from a public key. It's a “one-way street.”\n\nIn order to spend bitcoins from a particular Bitcoin address, one must prove “ownership” (or: knowledge) of the private key that refers to the public key associated with that address. And to prove ownership of a private key, without having to reveal that private key, a cryptographic signature is used.\n\nA signature is created by performing a calculation using the transaction data and the private key. And here's where the magic of public key cryptography comes in: Knowing the public key, anyone can see if the correct private key was used to create the signature. Without ever needing to know the private key itself.\n\nThe “owner” of the private key can therefore sign a transaction and spend bitcoins without worrying that someone else can take that private key and steal the bitcoins; the private key is never exposed, and the signature is only valid for that specific transaction.\n\n(For a more elaborate explanation of public key cryptography in Bitcoin, see this article. Or, just keep reading. While the basic signature concept matters, the details are not crucial for the purpose of this article.)\n\nSchnorr\n\nSo what, then, are Schnorr signatures?\n\nSchnorr, named after its inventor Claus-Peter Schnorr, is a signature scheme: the series of mathematical rules that link the private key, public key and signature together. Many cryptographers consider Schnorr signatures the best in the field, as they offer a strong level of correctness, do not suffer from malleability, are relatively fast to verify, and ? importantly ? support multisignature: several signatures can be aggregated into a single, new signature.\n\nHowever, until now it has not been possible to utilize Schnorr in Bitcoin. Another type of signature scheme, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), is baked into the Bitcoin protocol, and changing that would require a hard fork.\n\nThat's where Segregated Witness comes in.\n\nWith Segregated Witness, all signature data is moved to a separate part of the transaction: the witness, which is not embedded in the “old” Bitcoin protocol. And thanks to script versioning, almost any rule applied in the witness can be changed through a soft fork. Including the type of signature scheme used.\n\nThis opens the door for Schnorr.\n\nCapacity\n\nThe Schnorr property that stands to benefit Bitcoin most is multisignature aggregation.\n\nMany Bitcoin transactions include multiple inputs, referring to the addresses bitcoins are sent from. (This can be compared to how cash payments often consist of multiple smaller bills and coins to pay a larger sum of money.) Right now, all these inputs require their own signature, which means all these signatures must be included in a transaction, all must be transmitted over the network, and all must be included in a block.\n\nWith Schnorr, however, all inputs will instead require only one combined signature to represent all these different signatures. This offers an obvious data advantage, as only one signature must be included in a transaction, only one must be transmitted over the network, and only one must be included in a block. This means there's more room for transactions.\n\nFor example:\n\nSegregated Witness, as proposed by Bitcoin Core, offers a (roughly) 75 percent discount on all data included in the witness rather than the original block. One megabyte of witness data is therefore “weighed” as .25 megabyte, which would leave room for .75 megabyte transaction data in the original block, for a total of 1 megabyte.\n\nIf aggregated Schnorr signatures reduce the total size of witness data, say from 1 megabyte to .5 megabyte, this .5 megabyte would then be discounted to 0.125 megabyte, leaving room for up to 0.875 megabyte in the original block. (A capacity increase of about 17 percent.)\n\nThe exact amount of added room depends on the types of transactions included in blocks. But rough estimates by Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo suggest that Schnorr signatures could eventually increase total capacity 40 percent or more – that’s on top of the added 60 to 100 percent already offered by Segregated Witness.\n\nMultisig\n\nThe capacity increase as described above is true for regular transactions, as many transactions include more than one input. But the advantage can be even greater in the case of multisig transactions ? transactions where a single input itself requires several signatures (typically from different people).\n\nAs with normal transactions, no more than a single signature needs to be included in any multisig transaction. No matter how many signatures are required, no matter how many people involved.\n\nThis opens the door to vastly more complex smart contract constructions, for a fraction of the data normally required. Whether it's two-of-three, three-of-fifteen or hundred-of-hundred types of multisig transactions, all will carry the same amount of signature data as a typical single-signature transaction.\n\nPrivacy\n\nAnd third, Schnorr signatures could offer another interesting benefit: incentivized privacy.\n\nAs mentioned, one transaction can include multiple inputs. Most commonly, these inputs refer to addresses that are all controlled by the same person. (As per the multiple bills and coins example.)\n\nBut a privacy-enhancing trick invented by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell, CoinJoin, allows different users to combine all their transactions into a single transaction. That one transaction will include multiple inputs coming from different payers, which sends money to multiple outputs, belonging to different payees.\n\n(This can be compared to a group of people throwing their bills and coins together in a basket, which they use to go shopping in different stores to buy the products all of them want. Each individual will get the goods that individual paid for, but it's unlikely any individual's “own” bill paid for the product that individual bought.)\n\nIf done right, CoinJoin is a great way to improve privacy on the Bitcoin protocol, as it becomes unclear which inputs paid which outputs exactly, let alone which person paid which person.\n\nCoinJoin is not a new concept. But up until now CoinJoin was typically a bit of a hassle. As such, most people don't bother. And since most people don't bother, those who do bother could automatically be marked as suspicious; potentially defeating the purpose of using CoinJoin in the first place.\n\nBut Schnorr signatures can add a new advantage to CoinJoin. It enables all participants in a CoinJoin transaction to not only combine their transactions, but to also combine their signatures. And doing so means the size of the transaction would actually be smaller than all individual transactions combined. Which, in turn, means miners would typically charge a smaller fee to process the transaction.\n\nWith Schnorr, therefore, CoinJoin would not only increase privacy, but also – importantly – lower the costs for everyone involved. Indeed, there would be a cost benefit to use the most private option, which might just make it the go-to option for everyone – vastly increasing Bitcoin privacy for all.\n\nNote: The process of implementing Schnorr signatures in Bitcoin is still in the concept phase. While most Bitcoin Core developers seem to believe Schnorr signatures can be safely deployed in Bitcoin, it is too early to say with certainty.\n\nThanks to Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream co-founder Dr. Pieter Wuille for providing information, and Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo for proofreading and further suggestions.""]"
04/15/2016,"['Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology\'s use case as an asset class\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin prices fluctuated largely within a tight range between $415 and $425 during the seven days ending 15th April, while the value of ether, the native token on the Ethereum blockchain, declined sharply after weeks of advances.\n\nBitcoin\'s lack of volatility largely mirrored the last several weeks, when the digital currency was stable across international markets.\n\nThis stability again took place amid modest volume, as market participants traded just over 11m BTC during the seven days through 9:45 EST on 15th April, according to figures from Bitcoinity.\n\nTransaction volume was similar during the week through 8th April, far below the robust trading activity that had existed in preceding weeks.\n\nEther\'s descent\n\nWhile bitcoin has seen range-bound prices, ether plunged more than 56% during the week ending 15th April at 12:00 UTC, according to Poloniex figures.\n\nGeorge Samman, blockchain advisor and consultant, described the development as one that had been foreshadowed by changes in market fundamentals.\n\n""Ether has fallen back to earth for sure,"" Samman told CoinDesk. ""Its technicals were deteriorating for a while and finally price fell with them.""\n\nChristopher Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, spoke to the currency’s selloff, noting that exchange data signaled a shift was forthcoming as well.\n\n""The sell order book on [digital currency exchange] Poloniex has consistently been 30-50% deeper than the buy order book,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nBut while ether has been suffering sharp price volatility, it has also been experiencing robust transaction activity.\n\nThe currency’s daily trades neared 35,000 on 14th April and remained above 30,000 during the several days prior. Since mid-March, these daily transactions have almost always stayed above 30,000.\n\nIn comparison, the digital currency did not consistently exceed 10,000 trades per day before December 2015.\n\nDownside projections\n\nEther has also been enjoying a steadily rising hashrate, as this measure of processing power reached 2,000 GH/s on 14th April, compared to 1,232 GH/s a month before, Etherscan.io figures reveal. The figures indicate that interest in rewards for transaction processing on the network is increasing.\n\nAs for what ether prices will do going forward, experts provided varying forecasts. Samman offered a bearish prediction, speaking to technical analysis performed on the digital currency.\n\n""I expect more downside follow through in the coming weeks and $6.50 area is pretty major support,"" he stated. ""On the upside, $8.80 to $9.00, which was support is now resistance. It should continue to be volatile as traders look for new levels.""\n\nBurniske offered a different point of view, choosing to focus on basic market variables.\n\n""As fundamental transaction use continues to build over time, ether could enjoy a sustained rise,"" he stated, adding:\n\n""As with all markets, it’s a function of supply vs demand, buyers vs sellers, and it will be particularly interesting to see what happens over time, as Ethereum is constructed to always release new coins each year, albeit at a lower percentage of total outstanding.""\n\nHolding pattern\n\nOn the bitcoin side, some experts have emphasized that at least for now, the digital currency is stuck in a holding pattern.\n\n""In bitcoin, volume and volatility continue to drop,"" said Samman. ""At this point as it sits range-bound and I\'ve been saying this for a few weeks, it’s a broken record. It’s still ‘sit on your hands’ and wait time.""\n\nHowever, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, sees a light at the end of the tunnel. Geopolitical turmoil in Europe will push bitcoin prices higher over the coming months, he predicted.\n\nSuch a development could provide bitcoin with headwinds, as market observers have repeatedly observed that in times of market turmoil, the digital currency can act like a safe haven similar to gold.\n\nAside from the challenges affecting Greece, another development in Europe that could push bitcoin prices higher is the chance the UK might exit or ""Brexit"" the European Union. Markets will enter a risk-off phase amid concerns the EU is over, and this development will place upward pressure on bitcoin prices, Hayes told CoinDesk.\n\nHowever, he predicted that if Greek politicians back down from their demands, bitcoin prices could fall.\n\nCharles L.

Any settlement of cash requires significantly higher fees compared to digital payments as it requires a middleman or a mediator to administer the settlement.\n\nHowever, the middlemen like banks and Western Union charge nearly up to 10% of the transaction as conversion and service fees, leaving the families of Mexican immigrants with only 90% of the actual payment.\n\nMore importantly, most Mexican families that reside in the rural areas of the country can’t easily access remittance outlets such as Western Union and banks. Ultimately, with the transaction / conversion fees and money it takes to travel to the remittance outlets, around 85% of the transaction is left for the families to take.\n\nBitcoin as a solution\n\nBitcoin is a feasible solution for several reasons. First, Bitcoin transactions are purely digital and decentralized. This means that Bitcoin transactions don’t require any third party applications or mediators to step in and oversee the settlement of payments which significantly lessens conversion and transaction fees.\n\nAnother benefit of using Bitcoin in sending remittance is the currency’s high international conversion rate. Unlike most reserve currencies, Bitcoin has high international conversion rate due to its demand.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin transactions don’t require Mexican families to travel to search for remittance outlets and banks to receive their payments. With Bitcoin, they can be their own bank.\n\nThe same has been said about Malaysia’s remittance regulation in 2015. Last year, the Malaysian government implemented a regulatory policy which states that expat workers and residents of Malaysia are not allowed sending cash to other countries, effectively terminating all international remittances.\n\nMany proposed the use of Bitcoin but because of the lack of Bitcoin infrastructure in Malaysia, the plan never took off.', 'Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 was released early this morning and the update includes several changes that have huge implications for Bitcoin scalability. The release deploys the first soft fork on the Bitcoin network to use the methodology outlined in BIP 9 (Version Bits), which allows multiple soft forks to take place at the same time.\n\nThe three BIPs (BIP 68, BIP 112 and BIP 113) included in Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 have huge implications for the Lightning Network, which many believe to be Bitcoin’s best chance for long-term scalability. Although the code for the soft fork has been deployed, miners cannot signal their support for it until May 1st.\n\nA Huge Step Forward for the Lightning Network\n\nThe three BIPs implemented in this latest release of Bitcoin Core combine to enable relative locktime. This means that payment channels can now be closed without a predetermined date, which would be set when the channel is initially opened. This provides more flexibility to layer-2 initiatives, such as the Lightning Network, because users will be able to exit channels in a more timely manner.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo for further details on how these new changes will affect the flexibility between channels on the Lightning Network, and he said:\n\n“It depends on the locktime duration -- it’s a tradeoff. Too short a time means not enough time to enforce a revocation (and steal back the funds). Too long a time and you risk waiting a while to force the channel to close if the counterparty is unresponsive.”\n\nLombrozo also added, “I’m not sure we’ve settled on an optimum value.”\n\nAccording to Lombrozo, the reliability of outsourced revocation, the number of hops between channels, and other variables must also be considered. The Ciphrex CEO added, “Ideally, the locktime is never used. It’s there to prevent broadcast of revoked commitments.”\n\nIn a scenario where a user wants to close a channel and the counterparty complies, Lombrozo claims the channel can essentially be closed in the next block.\n\nBlock Space More About Users Than Transactions?\n\nOne of the key points that Lightning Network co-creator Joseph Poon has made lately (along with co-creator Tadge Dryja) is that his generalized network for payment channels turns the block size limit into an issue of users rather than transactions. This is because bidirectional payment channels with relative locktimes can theoretically stay open forever.\n\nWhile it’s unclear what percentage of Bitcoin users will want to use the Lightning Network for the vast majority of their transactions, it’s clear to see that this system requires block space for opening and closing channels rather than actual transactions. Although, it should be noted that a user can also send funds in a transaction that is meant to close a channel.\n\nIf everyone were using the Lightning Network, the block size limit would be a limit on the number of users who can open channels with other users. Having said that, this scenario is unlikely as there are still reasons to use the underlying Bitcoin blockchain for reasons other than opening or closing a payment channel.\n\nMultiple Soft Forks at the Same Time\n\nThe soft fork rolled out in Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 will also not delay the deployment of Segregated Witness because Version Bits was used to implement these new features. Version Bits has implications for the pace at which scalability solutions can be added to Bitcoin, and it also enables a warning system to alert older nodes when new rules are going to be activated. The new rules become active when 95 percent of miners have upgraded to the new version of Bitcoin Core.\n\nThank you to Bitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo for providing technical details and feedback for this article.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

You could deposit U.S. dollars, for example, and convert them to pesos to send money to a friend in Mexico, never dealing with bitcoin in any way.\n\nUphold now boasts more than $100 million in funds held in Uphold wallets, and says more than $900 million in transaction volume has been exchanged on the site. It is also part of a pilot program with the Antwerp World Diamond Centre that encourages a large portion of the world’s diamond traders to use Uphold for conversion of funds.\n\nUphold CEO Anthony Watson, whose resume includes executive roles at Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Barclays (BCS) and Nike (NKE), has publicly expressed doubts about bitcoin, which has not ingratiated him to the vocal community of enthusiasts with high hopes for the currency. “I’ll be surprised if bitcoin is here in five years,” he told Fortune last year. “It’s a means to an end. The value of bitcoin isn’t the currency, but the technology. I think once the world becomes more accustomed and attuned to the platform of bitcoin, the noise will go away, and the currency will go away too.” On forums like Reddit, bitcoin believers have disparaged Watson and Uphold.\n\nFrom Uphold\'s web site More\n\nHere\'s why the dispute between Uphold and Antonopoulos should matter to the larger financial market: Uphold is one of many fintech companies, along with Dwolla, TransferWise, Venmo, and Xoom, to name a few, that make a similar value claim: shorter transfer times and smaller transfer fees. That has been a popular selling point of bitcoin, too—but bitcoin risks collapsing due to problems with its own infrastructure. Meanwhile, 45 major global banks have signed on to a consortium to test out a form of blockchain, the technology on which bitcoin runs—but a closed version of blockchain, without bitcoin.\n\nStory Continues', ""Ransomware, rogue software which encrypt data on your hard disk and demand payment in bitcoins to restore it, have been on the rise recently. Hospitals, police stations and universities have been the recent targets of ransomware.\n\nWhat exactly are the causes of the increase in ransomware and did Bitcoin lead to its birth?\n\nCraig Williams, Senior Technical Leader of Cisco Talo, says:\n\n“The ability to demand payment in bitcoin, a difficult-to-trace virtual currency not controlled by any country, was 'basically the birth of ransomware' and has helped drive its success since the currency's introduction in 2009.”\n\nEarly cases of ransomware\n\nMalware has actually been around for ages. Brain, one of the first PC-based malware, spread through floppy disks and was discovered in 1986. The advent of the internet and email only led to new ways of propagation.\n\nOne of the early cases of ransomware (a class of malware, which encrypts file and demands ransom) is the AIDS Info Disk, which has been around since 1989.\n\nThis ransomware demanded payment to be made to PC Cyborg Corporation for renewal of licence. The payment was asked to be sent to a post office box in Panama.\n\nCryptolocker\n\nCryptolocker, which was first seen in 2013, gained notoriety by infecting over 250,000 computers. The industry's best practices were implemented in this ransomware.\n\nInstead of using a custom cryptographic implementation, cryptolocker used strong cryptography offered by Microsoft's CryptoAPI, which made the program robust.\n\nPayment was also demanded in bitcoins, which made it difficult to trace. Infected users were asked to pay ~$300 worth of bitcoins and the total estimated amount extorted by the operators of this scheme is more than $3 million.\n\nIncrease in ransomware in 2016\n\nThere has been a sharp increase in ransomware and ransom payments in 2016, with an estimated total of more than $200 million being paid in the first 3 months of the year.\n\nPayments demanded from organizations are larger – in the range of $10,000 to $20,000 and the operators even have call centers set up to assist the victims in making payment.\n\nThe latest strain, Samas, which has targeted hospitals, exploits vulnerabilities, giving it entry into Jboss application servers. While the instances of ransomware have increased, it would be wrong to blame Bitcoin for the increase.\n\nBitcoin is just technology, like email and the internet; nobody blames the internet for cyber crimes anymore."", 'The two new ATMs brings up the number of ATMs operated by CoinSource to 19 in the United States.\n\nWith an announcement, Bitcoin ATM network Coinsource has installed two more Bitcoin ATMs in San Diego County, in addition to one existing ATM. San Diego now sees three bitcoin ATMs active in the County operated by Coinsource.\n\nIn a statement, Coinsource CEO and Co-founder Sheffield Clark said:\n\nWhen we installed our first bitcoin ATM in San Diego in October 2015, Coinsource promised that we would continue to scour the area for more locations. We’re thrilled to offer three secure, fully compliant and always active bitcoin ATMs to the community.\n\nThe machines are installed in Oceanside and National City, with the first Coinsource operated ATM already installed in central San Diego. The two locations were chosen after research into factors such as population demographics, adjacent business hours and ease of access to the ATMs, the company stated.\n\nClark stated:\n\nCoinsource is proud to announce that everyone in and nearby San Diego County now has access to a low-fee, strategically located Bitcoin ATM.\n\n“We are scaling with the rise of cryptocurrency, and we chose these additional locations because we know how important convenience is to our customers,” he added.\n\nThe newest ATMs are manufactured GenesisCoin. There is a 7% rate for bitcoin purchasing which is reduced for higher volume purchases of the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn March 2016, Coinsource installed its first Bitcoin ATM in San Francisco, a city that now sees three active ATMs of the cryptocurrency in total.\n\nAltogether, Coinsource’s website reveals eight ATMs in New York City, one in Brooklyn, N.Y., one in Jamaica, N.Y., two in Las Vegas, one in Philadelphia, Pa., one in Dallas, Texas, one in Ft.

The website had an ominous notice posted on it about the closure stating, “Apparently the Estonian police can re-interpret the law, keep their interpretation secret, and apply it retroactively and arbitrarily. Unfortunately the courts in Estonia do not appear to see a problem with that.”\n\nSupreme Court rejected the claim by de Voogd that his activity could in no way be linked with Estonia as the portal was not located in Estonian servers. Also irrelevant in the opinion of the court was the fact that Bitcoin was created much later than Estonian laws treating the “alternative means of payment”.\n\nIntelligence asked owner to give info on customers\n\nIt all began in March 2014, when Dutch citizen resident in Estonia, Otto Albert de Voogd launched BTC.ee, a web based service that helped people buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, over the course of time the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) became interested in the operations of de Voogd’s bitcoin exchange service and asked him several oral and written questions.\n\nFIU asked to be given information on BTC.ee customers: their bank account numbers and the destination of where the money was being sent.\n\nThe Postimees Estonian News reports that Otto Albert decided to contest the FIU’s competence to supervise Bitcoin transactions. We asked Otto Albert de Voogd of BTC.ee about exactly what happened and he said:\n\n“Back in February 2014 I received a threatening e-mail from Estonian policeman Urmas Pai, that suggested they could start a criminal investigation against me. Subsequently he demanded that I provide them with information. I was not inclined to cooperate with an investigation against myself, so I declined to answer. I was told that if I did not answer I should file an appeal to the courts, which I did. The Supreme Court now ruled that I do not have the right to silence (similar to the US 5th amendment), because in their words, the risk of self-incrimination is either ""distant"" or ""theoretical"". I obviously disagree with that.”\n\nOtto de Voogd: Estonia Violated AML Laws\n\nOtto is of the view that Estonia has violated EU Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws by unilaterally extending the EU AML law without giving a proper justification and registering the extension of the law with the EU.\n\nHe argues that proper procedures were not followed in enforcement of the law. He also says that he is ‘irked’ by the fact that Estonian police did not reveal its interpretation of the law till they contacted him. Instead of making their position clear, he says, the police went on to look for people “to make an example off (sic)”.\n\nRay Youssef, CEO at Paxful Inc, a company that operated from Estonia, doesn’t agree with de Voogd’s stand. “We don\'t have a crystal ball but this usually happens when businesses have a standoffish attitude towards the police, - says Youssef. - The police then take measures to enforce their right to police the situation, especially in such a small state like Estonia. We at Paxful left New York State for Estonian when the Bit License essentially out lawed a bitcoin startup\'s agility. We at Paxful have zero tolerance for anything that would stifle innovation and we can say with confidence that we feel safe operating in Estonia.”\n\nEstonia wants to extend its Bitcoin policy EU-wide\n\nWhat effect the regulation of Bitcoin by Estonia will have on the cryptocurrency in Estonia is also a matter of perspective and interpretation, depending on who you ask.\n\nAccording to Otto de Voogd, restrictions imposed by Estonia mean that customers that trade more than 1,000 Euros worth of Bitcoins should be met literally face-to-face by representatives of exchanges and other parties involved.\n\nDe Voogd adds that the Estonian government had been aware of issues surrounding Bitcoin for more than two years but has chosen to do nothing to change the situation.\n\nEstonia imposed Value Added Tax (VAT) on the entire value of a Bitcoin transaction. De Voogd is of the view that the country’s arguments in European Court of Justice (ECJ) for extension of this policy EU-wide is a huge setback for Bitcoin in the EU.\n\nHowever, the ECJ has ruled otherwise.\n\nTo Regulate or Not to Regulate - That is the question\n\nThere are obvious differences among individuals as well as companies when it comes to regulations and their utility. It is also a matter of debate as to who should regulate what.\n\nEurope is a unique case because there are national and supranational laws as well as regulators and decision making bodies.\n\nInterestingly, the Estonian Supreme Court decision can be seen as a landmark case because the court ruled that even if the servers were not located in their jurisdiction, the regulators have sufficient grounds to intervene. The operations of Otto’s business were located in Estonia, collected money in cash from Estonia and had been specifically created for an Estonian clientele.\n\nWhile preventing money laundering is an obvious concern of any state, overreach by the establishment is also a valid concern. However not everyone thinks that this is an extreme decision by the court.\n\nRay Youssef says, “Within Estonia this will have little effect as this legislation was, by all indicators, passed to protect the police from legal liability in ending what they saw as a unworkable situation. Bitcoin itself was never the issue in this case. The spirit of this law and the details surrounding it will certainly be lost on EU officials and it may very well be used by other politicians within the EU as precedent to suppress bitcoin as a whole.”\n\nAs for Otto de Voogd, we asked him if he would take this matter to the EU courts and he had this to say, “If I can, I will take it up with the European Court of Human Rights, I am also considering to file a complaint at the European Commission.”', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

04/16/2016,"['Bitcoin price touched long-term resistance in the Bitstamp chart, today. Although the picture looks different across different exchange charts it is clear an important moment for the longer-term outlook has arrived.\n\nThis analysis is provided by xbt.social with a 3-hour delay.

The price action of the past few days has been building additional advancing waves, but the wave patterns themselves do not yet resemble impulsive advance. This does not mean that a rally cannot continue higher – bitcoin price sometimes moves in diagonal waves that consist of 3 wave patterns (ordinarily corrective) but that advance with more ferocity than the orthodox Elliott impulse wave.\n\nWhat makes the current juncture of price unclear is the position of price in relation to a set of significant trendlines in the surrounding chart area.\n\nOverlapping Trendlines\n\nThe first is the descending long-term resistance line (grey) that we have been tracking as a watershed for several weeks. The Bitstamp chart reached this significant trendline today. The OKCoin USD and futures charts have broken this trendline to the upside, while the CNY exchanges are about 100 CNY (~$15) below this trendline. With different configurations in the different exchange charts, this level does not give us a unified signal that the market has broken significant long-term resistance.\n\nThe second important trendline has developed since March of this year and is a rising trendline (blue) that caps the zigzagging price action from the early March low until now. Again, the Bitstamp chart, today, reached this trendline where it intersects with long-term resistance. This is not the case across exchanges – OKCoin futures, for example, still has several dollars of advance between its current high and its upside channel level.\n\nDoubled Resistance Can Buckle\n\nSometimes price is rejected by such doubled resistance, but at other times the market uses such an intersection of two major support/resistance lines as a gateway through the compounded resistance.\n\nDuring an attempt on this intersection zone, earlier today, Bitstamp traders failed to break through and price has since retreated. Another attempt may follow, or price may have reversed from the level already.\n\nWave Counts\n\nDivergence in the momentum indicators (magenta annotations) imply a strong correction or reversal that fits with the wave count for wave D.\n\nThe latter are, typically, irrational market waves that fits with the character of price action since March. If the current high is the final wave “e” of wave D, then a corrective triangle has completed in the chart. When a triangle forms within a larger correction, it usually forms in the penultimate corrective wave position. which means that a wave E to the downside is next. Bitcoin E waves can be devastating.\n\nIf price does manage to get above long-term resistance, then the alternate wave count (in red) means that a diagonal advance is unfolding and that wave C (of wave III) can strike out to $500 and beyond.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price added another subwave to the advance today. There is complete ambiguity about what happens next. If price can break above resistance across exchanges then a powerful rally should ignite. If the present downside wave continues lower then a strong decline may be looming. Let’s see what the market has been intending all along.\n\nBitfinex Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin-price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

So what does this feature enable? Turing completeness is a property of any programming language that allows a computer to simulate anything that our universe contains.\n\nIf a language is Turing complete, it can provide all of the logic we\'ve grown accustomed to in our computers. Turing completeness enables a computer to \'loop\' and process its own output in iteratively complex terms. This property is absent in nearly all public blockchains. But with the modern advent of Ethereum, this feature is now available to aspiring blockchain coders.\n\nThough this feature is the innovation that Ethereum has advertised as its competitive advantage, it\'s a trivial switch to flip \'on\'. So, why wasn\'t this feature included in earlier blockchains?\n\nBitcoin implemented the world\'s first smart contract system, and intentionally switched this feature \'off\'. Bitcoin supports a number of simple contract types ranging from ""multisig"", (the transfer of value given approval by a number of parties); ""check timelock"" (contracts which authorize the spending of value after an amount of time has passed); and a handful of simpler contracts which closely resemble the functions of a paper check in assigning value to a recipient.\n\nWith Turing completeness, the possibilities for programming smart contracts are only limited to the amount of creativity and processing time for which a contract designer is willing to pay.\n\nCost benefits\n\nSo, what\'s the problem with giving users more options?\n\nWell, off the bat, there\'s the size and processing costs that come with allowing users to store more data on the blockchain. With bitcoin, even one megabyte every 10 minutes is controversially large. And with Turing-complete blockchains like Ethereum, the size and processing issues are enormously more pronounced.\n\nThis overhead reduces the ability for small computers and nodes to run the blockchain with low energy and bandwidth. This also impacts any node operating in a remote location. Though such low-end overhead support may seem trivial in the context of the aspirations of large banking projects, it\'s important to recognize the effects of this trade-off when applied to the primary reason to use blockchains – servicing the underserved.\n\nTo understand why blockchains have found an efficiency in servicing the underserved, one must understand why users \'mine\', or expend costs in order to secure and process transactions on a blockchain network.\n\nIn bitcoin, mining acts as an incentive to reward those who may benefit from the utility of the system. People mine because they wish to convert ""registered"" value, electricity registered in their name, into ""anonymous"" value that they can use to transact on the Internet.\n\nThey may want to do so due to local currency restrictions or to have better access to an easier way to spend money online.\n\nBut the costs to the one providing this service must be supported by a high number of users who want to actually use that service.\n\nWhether such demand exists for a Turing-complete blockchain network remains to be seen. Thus far, this proposition would appear dubious.\n\nNetwork benefits\n\nSuch subsidies would require that an inordinate amount of underserved users are currently looking for Turing completeness, and not building smart contracts because of the lack of this feature.\n\nWhile there are certainly many users being denied access to basic contract services, the question remains whether the value of the difference in service can pay for the inordinately higher overhead they require.\n\nPut simply, there needs to be a lot more of these users than have been found using just the bitcoin network itself.\n\nTo date, all Turing-complete miners today are only mining for the speculative value for ether, the native token on the Ethereum network, and to date no such underserved utility has been found – the proposition would seem extraordinary.\n\nAnother finicky proposition in Turing-complete smart contracts is that of the ""oracle"".\n\nIn a smart contract, data needs to enter the blockchain from an outside source in order to be of use. The source of this information – whether it be the price of a commodity, or the outcome of a sporting event, needs to be broadcast by individuals.\n\nThese individuals are called ""oracles"".\n\nIn non-Turing complete smart contract platforms, these oracles are to be found in ""multisig"" contracts, where one of the parties is the oracle, and the other two parties are the contract participants. In a ""two-of-three"" multisig operation, for instance, the oracle merely enters a winner onto the blockchain without additional code attached.\n\nIn a Turing-complete model, the parties themselves broadcast the code onto the blockchain well in advance, and let the nodes on the blockchain determine the outcome at the time an oracle broadcasts the event outcome \'data\'.\n\nSo what\'s the difference? Well, in a Turing-complete model, a secondary contract can be broadcast alongside the primary contract for the sole purpose of \'corrupting\' the oracle. This means that participants in the Turing-complete contract can not only engage in a contract, but can also bribe the oracle with impunity, and without repercussion.\n\nThis problem becomes more pronounced as more individuals stand to gain by engaging in the bribery attempt. Though it\'s still possible for oracles to be bribed the old-fashioned way in a non-Turing arrangement, the delivery of value isn\'t guaranteed, and the risk of corruption is significantly mitigated.\n\nTransparency issues\n\nYet another major issue with Turing completeness is, perhaps ironically, their transparency implications.\n\nAs part of the requirements to evaluate a Turing-complete contract, the code to that contract must be publicly available. In Turing-complete blockchains, this code is presented at the time that its participants engage in an agreement.\n\nWhile transparency can often be an advantage to some value-transfer propositions, the problems associated with broadcasting everyone\'s position are fairly obvious. Most financial contracts require that information be asymmetrically held between the involved parties, so that uninvolved traders cannot trade advantageously on these agreements.\n\nShould a major bank be found taking a position in the market (say a futures contract), the risk to that institution is that the market can publicly trade on, and determine the future of that bank before the contract has executed. Though there are some theoretical fixes to the problems of disclosure, these solutions will be a long time coming, and may never arrive at all.\n\nDecentralization is rarely efficient, and is generally only an efficiency when individuals have exhausted all other options. The most successful blockchains will be found where the degree of decentralization occurs around the areas that match the regulatory arbitrage requirements they need, without any additional waste.\n\nThus far, evaluating code itself has yet to incur enough risk to justify the inordinate overhead and complexity needed to sustain this cost. Currently, most of the actors that need such services are finding that payment transfer alone entirely wraps the risk.\n\nOffshore gambling institutions and blockchain users have been able to operate code on their websites with little fear of reprisal from countries friendly to their service. And it would be expected that for occurrences where the risk of default is impacting their ability to retain users, ""check timelock"" contracts will suffice.\n\nBlockchains are an amazing tool for servicing those that the regulatory environment requires that they service.\n\nHowever, as the hype cycle begins in this new phase of blockchain, it\'s important to remember that as we look back, the question of ""Who needs Turing complete smart contracts?"" may very well turn out to be ""No one"".\n\nFollow Chris DeRose on Twitter.\n\nCheck image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Custos Media Technologies is looking at Bitcoin as a way to combat piracy, especially in the film industry.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Price Watch; One, Two and Three!\n\nUsing Bitcoin To Bring Film Piracy To A Halt\n\nFor many years now, movie industry experts have been trying to come up with a way to reduce the number of pirated films on the Internet. As soon as a movie hits the theatres, it doesn’t take that long until the first pirated copies start appearing online, albeit they usually are in horrible quality.\n\nBut that situation might be coming to change if South African startup Custos Media Technologies has a say in the matter. They are offering bounty hunters a reward in Bitcoin for reporting leaked movies on the Internet. However, there is more to this concept than just that, as the company has come up with the necessary technology to make this process as seamless as possible.\n\nAssuming the startup can strike a deal with content producers, all movie pre-release copies will have a Bitcoin wallet encoded in them, which is used to identify the recipient. Think of this as a digital watermark in physical form that is visible on the surface, but it can not be removed. Every time a film is uploaded to piracy websites, bounty hunters can look out for these Bitcoin wallets, which will transmit data about the pre-release movie recipient to the Custos Media Technologies blockchain.\n\nIt comes as little to no surprise to find out Digital Currency Group has taken an interest in this project and were part of the company’s second round seed investment. Despite all of the promise this project holds, it is important to remember the Bitcoin startup is not targeting the downloaders themselves. Issues like these have to be identified by the source, rather than the ones who end up the product.\n\nStopping piracy takes a lot more than going after the people downloading the content. Instead, the individual or group responsible for making these pre-release copies available on the Internet are the ones who need to be taken down. Offering a Bitcoin bounty might be a good idea although it is doubtful as to how the movie industry will respond to these ideas.\n\nSource: Fin24\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'The true meaning of decentralisation might be that a decentralized currency actually does require centralization. CoinTelegraph speaks to Brandon Kostinuk of the Vanbex Group to look into the “common confusion”.\n\nIt is Kostinuk who calls it “a common confusion”. He explains that in the financial world the realization of a decentralized system, one without a central clearing house or authority to act as the intermediary between transactions, is an ideal proposition for anonymity and personal privacy.\n\nKostinuk argues that the above described arrangement is not a practical approach to financial governance in the 21st century, not with data already present on money laundering and other illicit financial activity.\n\nTop 10 highest risk countries\n\nIn its 2015 Anti-Money Laundering Index, the Basel Institute on Governance, an independent not-for-profit competence centre that specializes in corruption prevention, public governance, anti-money laundering and more, reported on the the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing of countries worldwide.\n\nThe Basel Institute used 14 different indicators that deal with Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations, corruption, financial standards, political disclosure and rule of law to aggregate an overall score, which is then used to compile an index rated from highest risk to the lowest.\n\nIn examination of the top 10 on their list, the Basel Institute concludes:\n\n“The majority of high-risk countries are characterized by intrinsic weaknesses in both preventing and enforcing multiple aspects of the AML/CFT framework.”\n\nReasons raised refer to structural and functional vulnerabilities such as high rates of perceived corruption, lack of judicial strength, but also, and most relevant to the subject here, a lack of resources to control the financial system, and lack of public and financial transparency.\n\nBitcoin must be regulated and overseen in order to survive\n\nKostinuk points out that to enable the kind of security, trust and level playing field a public-use financial system requires, it must be accessible to overseers.\n\nFurther, that process, along with the system itself, must be as open and transparent as necessary to regulate and enforce against illicit activity.\n\nTo push further his argument, Kostinuk makes reference to R3CEV’s announcement, which he describes as “an announcement in the waiting, the logical progression for the financial sector.”\n\nIn this announcement contains the opinion that to make the step toward adopting next generation technology, that technology can’t mean a fatal disruption of such a prominent pillar within the global system.\n\nFurther, it’s the technology, not the semantics attached and associated, that is most important.\n\nBuilding trust and viability\n\nR3 is reverse-engineering, tackling the problem of adapting blockchain technology to fit to current constraints and frameworks.\n\nRichard G. Brown, chief technology officer at R3, writes:\n\n""We are not building a blockchain. Unlike other designs in this space, our starting point is individual agreements between firms. We reject the notion that all data should be copied to all participants, even if it is encrypted.""\n\nMaintaining a decentralized structure, R3’s latest technology helps adapt blockchain technology to long-established regulatory and supervisory frameworks.\n\nKey focuses of Corda that that help build trust and mainstream viability, include:\n\nA design that directly enables regulatory and supervisory observation of nodes;\n\nSupport of a variety of consensus mechanisms;\n\nIt is built on industry-standard tools and has no native cryptocurrency.\n\nThese are frameworks, as the Basel Institute attests to, that are necessary to combat illegal activity like money laundering and terrorist financing, among other elements and actions of malefactors.\n\nControl and regulation at the local or individual level\n\nCorda’s blockchain architecture also allows for interoperability and flexibility so as not to restrict and constrict inclusion. Agnostic is the best avenue in the digital space.\n\nFurther, R3 reports that the technology will include agreement at the “local” or individual level as well as offer validation between just parties involved in a transaction in contrast to a “broader pool of unregulated validators.”\n\nKostinuk explains that the fact financial institutions are at the core of this development also stands to reason individuals could then exist and operate on a layer above, supported by the same fiscal framework the global economy currently beats to, just one more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nHe says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“To anyone that believes a decentralized, peer-to-peer system could operate without regulation and oversight, consider the Panama Papers scandal. Even with rules and regulations, citizens — some of the wealthiest and supposedly legitimate businesspeople — circumvented the system for their personal gain. You can point to that and say the system as it is is not working, but one devoid of any ability to regulate and oversee sounds all the more alarming.”\n\nFinancial systems need some form of control, regulation and oversight and blockchain technology allows us to do just that. Another question is whether that is the kind of blockchain we want.', 'The difficulty level of Bitcoin mining recently went up by over 7 percent. What is it and why is it necessary? Read more...\n\nThe Bitcoin difficulty level recently increased by 7.09% recently. What is difficulty level and why is is important?\n\nBitcoin is probably the first decentralized, distributed open source digital currency protocol to gain massive adoption. No sooner the concept of digital currency was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in his whitepaper, it garnered a lot of interest from computer scientists and cryptographers. Some of these people had already tried creating a digital currency system with limited success. But Bitcoin offered a solution to many problems that were faced by the researchers until then. These very solutions were the reason for Bitcoin to become one of the widely adopted digital currencies in the world till date.\n\nThe main intention behind the creation of Bitcoin was to empower individuals by providing them with an alternative way to conduct peer to peer transaction over the internet without having to go through the middle men or a trusted third party like banking and financial institution. In order to fulfill its purpose, the digital currency protocol has to meet certain criteria. Apart from being scarce, fungible and highly divisible, it is important for bitcoin network to maintain consistency. Consistency of the network takes a special place because of its distributed nature.\n\nWe all know that Bitcoin is an open source, decentralized digital currency where the miners, who are part of the Bitcoin community contribute processing power to discover new blocks and confirm transactions over the network. This is done by comparing the transaction ids with the existing record on the blockchain and inserting the new transaction records into fresh blocks. Technically, the time taken by a miner or a mining pool to discover a new block is directly proportional to the total processing power of the network, which in other words in known as hash rate.\n\nBitcoin mining is now carried out using specialized equipment called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) which are custom-built for the purpose. They have specialized circuits that churn out a lot of processing power. As technology advances, new superior Bitcoin mining ASICs are being designed and fabricated. These ASICs are far more efficient, both in terms of the hash rate and power consumption. With the new advanced mining ASICs replacing the older versions, the total hash rate on the Bitcoin network has skyrocketed. In an ideal situation, it would mean that the time required to create a new block drastically reduces too, leading to a proportional increase in the payouts. In order to prevent such a situation, the difficulty level of the Bitcoin network is exploited to keep the time taken for block discovery constant. The network automatically changes the difficulty level for Bitcoin mining to ensure the discovery of a new block every 10 minutes (600 seconds) by miners.\n\nThe Bitcoin network varies its difficulty levels after the discovery of every 2016 blocks to ensure a constant output. If the network hash rate is high and the time taken to discover a new block is less than 10 minutes, then the network will increase the difficulty level proportionately to increase the block discovery time. If the block discovery time is more than 10 minutes, then the same protocol will reduce the difficulty level.\n\nIn recent days, the Bitcoin mining difficulty levels have been constantly increasing, thanks to increasing network hash rate. Last week, the difficulty levels went up by over 7 percent. This is one of the highest hikes in the difficulty levels in the recent days, except for once in February when it increased by 20 percent. The network’s hashing power currently stands at about 1279029147 GH/second (as on April 14, 2016). These changes are absolutely necessary to ensure the reliability and smooth functioning of the largest digital currency network.', 'There is much discussion today about multinational firms entering into the blockchain space. They, in fact, with their deep pocketbooks, created an entirely new Industry: the blockchain industry. At industry events, many topics are explored, most notably centered on the ways in which forms of blockchain technology could make more efficient the business and government processes of today, from bank transfers to verification to data storage.\n\nIs it a Blockchain?\n\nAt the heart of much of this discussion regarding blockchain innovation is end-to-end encryption and multi-signature transactions. The use of multi-signature and end-to-end encryption, while an important part of Bitcoin’s iteration, are probably not what’s central to the innovation, and neither are particularly new. What’s central to the Bitcoin innovations is perhaps the distributed manner in which data consensus is reached and the way in which the network is secured: via miners and cryptography, as it were.\n\nThe purpose of this essay will not be to explore whether or not Bitcoin miners bring true security to the network (some of the brightest minds do not believe so), but, rather, we will explore whether or not, without a distributed consensus mechanism, can one have a true blockchain?\n\nIBM has announced it is all-in on blockchain, but are they all in on an entirely blockchain “blockchain?” That is murky. Major institutions will find it difficult to adapt the mining complex – a central piece of the blockchain technology as expressed by Bitcoin – to their business models.\n\nHow distributed could a private company ledger be? Is it even distributed if only one institution is running all the nodes on a network? These institutions will probably use distributed technology in some way to update their processes should they decide the blockchain can be made useful for their models. However, it likely won’t be all that distributed as the network will be limited to their enterprise.\n\nWhat could evolve is the organization designed by Dee Hock with the Visa model, in which all financial institutions take part in the network. However, unlike the VISA model this will be done in a technologically distributed manner. Dee Hock, founder of Visa, seems to think Bitcoin could offer a way forward:\n\n“Bitcoin is one of the best examples of how a decentralized, peer-to-peer organization can solve problems that these dated organizations cannot,” Hock once said. “[Bitcoin] presents incredible opportunities for new levels of efficiency and transparency in financial transactions.”\n\nHock told FastCompany: “In Visa, we tried to create an invisible organization and keep it that way. It’s the results, not the structure or management that should be apparent.”\n\nHe added: “[VISA] Members are free to create, price, market, and service their own products under the Visa name.” At the same time, in a narrow band of activity essential to the success of the whole, they engage in the most intense cooperation.” Power and complexity are two problems with which Hock concerned himself.\n\n“It was beyond the power of reason to design an organization to deal with such complexity, and beyond the reach of the imagination to perceive all the conditions it would encounter,” he said. “The organization had to be based on biological concepts to evolve, in effect, to invent and organize itself.”\n\nAnthony Di Iorio recently summed up the likely viewpoint of financial institutions and technology companies investigation the blockchain: “It’s the underlying technology behind Bitcoin, the blockchain,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “They’re interested in providing solutions; they don’t care what technology it is as long as it works.”\n\nThat sentiment likely underscores the coming innovations inspired, in part, by Bitcoin’s blockchain. The question about whether or not these advents are truly blockchains will depend largely on the modes of security and consensus adopted by institutions.\n\nImages from Shutterstock, R3 and Facebook.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

There you can find an interesting job offer or a freelance project and publish a post like “looking for a job in a Bitcoin startup”.\n\nThere is a lot of rubbish among the offers: offers of partnership, Click-to-Pay, and straightforward fraud.\n\nSometimes you can find a real treasure. You can get a freelance job at a good American rate, strike up promising acquaintances, and even arrange relocation to the USA, EC or Asia.\n\nHowever, job offers are updated quite seldom. Usually there are no guarantees of payment. Formal contracts are concluded on rare occasions, so there is a chance that you won’t get paid at all. In most cases, you get offers of one-time (project) work from private customers.\n\nThe most interesting resources include:\n\nJobs section on Reddit: There are not many offers, a lot of candidates, and reputation on Reddit can affect the choice of a contractor. But, as it always has been in freelancing, the capability to sell your services is crucial. For example, a small but strong team of developers succeeded in finding a number of very profitable orders here, despite the competition.\n\nFamous forum BitcoinTalk offers a lot of options for job searching: You can go directly to the local Russian thread (this option is suitable for those who do not speak English), and for others, we recommend visiting other threads on the forum (there you can find interesting offers from European and Asian customers from time to time), using the search by word feature with “job”, and looking into the Project Development section.\n\nAlmost everybody here offers payment in cryptocurrency (which is Bitcoin in 99.9% of cases). Job offers for copywriters, translators and content managers are posted here quite often.\n\nSpecial board BitGigs is more alive than dead – new job offers are posted here almost every day. Here you can find job offers not only for developers, but for photographers, graphic designers, music editors and experts in video.\n\nFreelance marketplaces and job search aggregators\n\nUnfortunately, the largest and most popular resources like Freelancer.com, UpWork, Fiverr do not provide an option to get paid in cryptocurrency. They just repeat requests and feature requests from clients and contractors and a large number of projects related to cryptocurrencies.\n\nFiverr is far ahead the others however. In 2014, it added the option to top-up your account balance with Bitcoin, but there was no further progress.\n\nThus, when you are looking for a job which is paid in cryptocurrency, you will have to forget about the popular resources and turn your attention to special freelance marketplaces.\n\nThe special freelance marketplaces are the following:\n\nThe XBTFreelancer.com marketplace appeared in 2015 and actively promoted itself on theme-based resources including BitcoinTalk, but unfortunately it was occupied by clients and contractors from the developing world. For this reason, favorable offers are quite rare here. In all other respects, everything is standard for freelance marketplaces: the most reputable participants and those who have talent to sell their own services get the best orders.\n\nThe Coinality.com aggregator collects requests from several HR resources and freelance marketplaces including UpWork. It is not clear why the latter are even needed, as they do not offer work for cryptocurrency. In all other respects, there are no issues: there is a lot of permanent work offered by unknown and large companies, direct contact details of employers are often published, search for offers by region is enabled, and remote work offers are posted. To find them, enter the “Anywhere” value in the location field of the form.\n\nBitcoinVacancy aggregates posts and advertisements from other resources and enables direct publishing of offers. Here you can mainly find permanent work for experts in project development.\n\nCryptocurrency companies and startups\n\nAs a nice bonus for employees, the great majority of companies dealing with cryptocurrencies (miners, exchanges, coin casino, etc.) offer payment in altcoins, including HashFlare, for example.\n\n?ngel.co, a platform for startups in search of investment, has opened a Jobs section too. Different projects post their vacancies and search for specialists there.\n\nYou can find many options to work for a wage/interest/share in a project, vacancies with relocation, and remote jobs.\n\nTips for finding a job on Angel.co\n\nMethod 1: Filter projects and companies by tags (keywords) Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, or Dogecoin. You will see a table of search results where the “View Jobs” button will be displayed to the right of the companies looking for employees.\n\nMethod 2: Go to the Jobs section and filter jobs by the same tags. To find a remote job, add the keyword “Remote OK”.\n\nThere is no need to register on Angel.co. Don’t waste your time filling in the profile and don’t get in touch with the startups you liked via this service. There is little point in it unless you took part in development of at least 3 or 5 well-known projects represented on Angel.co, live in Silicon Valley and (preferably) personally know Zuckerberg.\n\nFilling the account form takes a lot of time but companies rarely reply via Angel.co. It is better to go to the respective company’s website, find contact information there and contact them directly. Experience shows that it is much easier to get feedback and come to an agreement in this way.\n\nYou can also try to find a company’s contact information on CrunchBase. Go to the search section, use filters “cryptocurrency”, “bitcoin”, then go to the companies’ websites and look for “Jobs” or “Career” sections.\n\nGetting hired via Facebook\n\nIt seems that via Facebook you can find everything you want, including work for cryptocurrency.\n\nAlas, it is most likely that a post with an attractive picture (a pretty naked woman holding a Bitcoin in her hands for example) and a text like “Frontend developer looking for a job paid in Bitcoins” will not have much effect.\n\nIf among thousands of your friends were those who could help, you would have already asked them for help. But you never can tell. It is Facebook and the famous theory of six degrees of separation.\n\nIf it does not work, you can do the following:\n\nEnter something like “Bitcoin jobs” in the search field on Facebook. You will get a list of topic groups (see an example). Most of them are closed, so you’ll have to contact admins and ask them to add you to the group.\n\nTip: in some project descriptions on Angel.co and other similar platforms, you can find links to Facebook profiles of startup founders. Many of them can easily add you as a friend if you send them a request, and others will add you to their friend list when they see other founders among your friends. Then everything is simple: write them a personal message and offer your services, wait until any of your new friends share a vacancy in their project and reply to it, or make a bunch of such friends, and publish a post on the topic “I am intelligent, beautiful, ingenious and looking for a job paid in cryptocurrency”.\n\nMore practical tips\n\nReal-life experience is a great thing which helps to warn new job seekers against mistakes and provide solutions, which otherwise would take a long time to come up with.\n\nHere is a number of useful and proven tips that can help you on your difficult way of getting cryptocurrency in exchange for your knowledge and skills:\n\nBefore agreeing to work for altcoins, first learn how to convert them to fiat money and how much you will lose in fees. When you study this issue in details, you will often find out that it is not so rosy and profitable at all.\n\nFix your wage in fiat money instead of cryptocurrency. It is a common practice which allows you to secure your earnings, and 99% of employers agree to it. Example: You agree the wage of $2,000 to be paid in Bitcoin at the exchange rate for the date of payment.\n\nMonitor the exchange rate and do not hurry to exchange all your cryptocurrency at once, especially if your financial situation allows it. It is highly possible that within the next 1-2 weeks, the exchange rate will be more favorable. The only exception is if you get your payment at an exchange rate close to the maximum for the last 2-3 months. Then it’s better sell it all at once.\n\nReliable wallet/service for storage of your altcoins is the most important thing for you. Every owner of cryptocurrency can tell their own story of how they failed to rescue their PC flooded with beer, on which wallet files were stored, or could not restore access to the online wallet linked to their lost mobile phone.\n\nBy Egor Kotkin', ""With a focus on technology in the finance industry, transactions are in the process of evolving to the point where payments will forever change from traditional methods that have been used for decades.\n\nSEE ALSO: 7 worthwhile ways to automate social media\n\nBeing in the payments space for almost two years and helping build products around eCash, I've noticed how businesses need to adapt to the continuous advancements in technology. I've luckily had the opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds in the industry, and have gotten to know many of the companies revolutionizing the space.\n\nAt the forefront of these changes are numerous outlets offering disruptive processes and products. Here are ten companies forever changing how consumers and businesses make payments online:\n\nCompliance is a major challenge faced by many online payment providers. With real-time access to hundreds of secure and reliable data sources around the world, Trulioo's identity verification solution powers fraud and compliance systems for global payment providers, such as PayPal, Stripe and Square, through a single API integration. As a result, Trulioo saves time, reduces operational costs and facilitates a more transparent online identity verification process.\n\nFounded and owned by some of the world’s largest credit card brands, including American Express, Mastercard and Visa to name a few, this company is behind the introduction of smart debit and credit cards that contain a microprocessor chip to minimize and even stop fraud. It’s been so disruptive that the company has influenced significant changes in the payments industry with merchants now being required to switch to this system along with banks and other card issuers. Soon, the days of magnetic stripe cards will be a distant memory.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is the most well-known, pioneering brand behind cryptocurrency, there are now hundreds of various types of this digital currency that are under debate for the threat — or potential threat — they bring to financial institutions. This decentralized system allows people around the world to buy and sell products while also maintaining anonymity. Besides the financial possibilities that Bitcoin and other Internet currencies offer, there are even more non-financial applications that may emerge from this disruptive payment solution.\n\nPayStand's mission is to use modern Internet and SaaS technologies to transform B2B payments. Their flexible platform enables customers to easily embed online payments into their websites, invoices and mobile applications while maintaining full control of their customer's payment experience. Their unique technology supports cards, ACH, eCheck and eCash in a single system, which promotes choice in digital payments and greatly simplifies tracking and reporting.\n\nAlso intent on increasing access to payment methods, Stripe has helped marketplaces and businesses take their payment processing to the mobile environment, helping everything from pop-up shops to small businesses compete and market to a much wider audience.\n\nCreated as a way to pay tolls through mobile payment options, this Australian startup is now disrupting the transactions space by combining payment processing with geolocation services. Their more comprehensive tool could benefit any company that accepts payments on a location-specific basis.\n\nWith the advent of digital wallets, Stratos has emerged as a new way to organize all payment cards into one card, including any loyalty, membership and gift cards alongside all credit and debit cards. This simplifies what a person has to carry with him, reducing the risk of loss or theft. With so many cards held by the average consumer, Stratos proves that technology can really simplify lives, including making online and offline payments for all types of products and services.\n\nHelping many people obtain and more effectively manage credit is the mission of Affirm. This payments company offers consumers a way to take charge of their credit by creating personalized payment plans. For merchants who use Affirm, this means they can reach a wider audience who previously may not have been able to buy from certain retailers due to poor credit or no credit options.\n\nThis payment processor allows developers to customize a system fit to their business while still retaining all the security and privacy that customers expect when making online payments. The customization is part of the scalable framework behind this payment processing solution, helping even the smallest business look “big” in terms of how it accepts payments.\n\nBefore Square, many small businesses struggled because they were only able to accept a few types of payment methods, especially since transaction fees for credit cards were so expensive. However, Square has proved that any business can — and should be able to — accept debit and credit card payments without the high transaction fees. They have set a precedent in the payments industry by leveling the playing field for all types of businesses.\n\nThe common thread among these payment companies is that technology is streamlining, securing and simplifying the numerous transactions that we make on a daily basis. Additionally, these paperless and mobile solutions are showing how payments can cost less per transaction and be easier for those on both sides of the equation. While these payment systems may continue to evolve, they have certainly disrupted how we all look at transactions.""]"
04/17/2016,"['Dr Gideon Greenspan is the founder and CEO of Coin Sciences, the company behind the MultiChain platform for private blockchains.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Greenspan discusses blockchain-enabled smart contracts and why this application of the technology may be suffering from inflated expectations.\n\nAs the developer of a popular blockchain platform, I sometimes gets asked whether Ethereum-like smart contracts are on the MultiChain roadmap. The answer I always give is always: \'No, or at least not yet\'.\n\nBut in the hype-filled world of blockchains, smart contracts are all the rage, so why ever not? Well, the problem is, while we now know of three strong use cases for permissioned bitcoin-style blockchains (provenance, company recordkeeping and lightweight finance), we\'ve yet to find the equivalent for Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nIt\'s not that people don\'t understand what they want smart contracts to do. Rather, it\'s that so many of these ideas are simply impossible. When smart people hear the term ""smart contracts"", their imaginations tend to run wild. They conjure up dreams of autonomous intelligent software, going off into the world, taking data along for the ride. Unfortunately, the reality of smart contracts is more mundane.\n\nA smart contract is a piece of code that is stored on an blockchain, triggered by blockchain transactions and which reads and writes data in that blockchain\'s database. That\'s it. Really.\n\nA smart contract is just a fancy name for code that runs on a blockchain, and interacts with that blockchain\'s state. And what is the code? It\'s Pascal, it\'s Python, it\'s PHP. It\'s Java, it\'s Fortran, it\'s C++. If we\'re talking databases, it\'s stored procedures written in an extension of SQL.\n\nAll of these languages are fundamentally equivalent, solving the same sorts of problems in the same sorts of ways. Of course, each has its strengths and weaknesses – you’d be crazy to build a website in C or compress HD video in Ruby. But in principle at least, you could if you wanted to. You\'d just pay a heavy price in terms of convenience, performance, and quite probably, your hair.\n\nThe problem with smart contracts isn’t just that people’s expectations are overblown, it\'s that these expectations are leading many to spend time and money on ideas that cannot possibly be implemented.\n\nIt seems large companies have sufficient resources to travel a lengthy path – from the moment when senior management encounters a new technology, to when that technology\'s advantages and limitations are truly understood. Perhaps our own experience can help shorten this time.\n\nOver the past nine months, we\'ve been pitched many smart contract use cases, and have found ourselves responding, time and again, that they simply cannot be done.\n\nAs a result, we\'ve identified the three smart contract misconceptions that are most commonly held. These ideas aren\'t wrong because the technology is immature, or the tools are not yet available.\n\nRather, they misunderstand the fundamental properties of code which lives in a database and runs in a decentralized way.\n\n1. Contacting external services\n\nOften, the first use case proposed is a smart contract that changes its behavior in response to some external event. For example, an agricultural insurance policy which pays out conditionally based on the quantity of rainfall in a given month.\n\nThe imagined process goes something like this: The smart contract waits until the predetermined time, retrieves the weather report from an external service and behaves appropriately based on the data received.\n\nThis all sounds simple enough, but it’s also impossible. Why? Because a blockchain is a consensus-based system, meaning that it only works if every node reaches an identical state after processing every transaction and block.\n\nEverything that takes place on a blockchain must be completely deterministic, with no possible way for differences to creep in. The moment that two honest nodes disagree about the chain\'s state, the entire system becomes worthless.\n\nNow, recall that smart contracts are executed independently by every node on a chain. Therefore, if a smart contract retrieves some information from an external source, this retrieval is performed repeatedly and separately by each node. But because this source is outside of the blockchain, there is no guarantee that every node will receive the same answer.\n\nPerhaps the source will change its response in the time between requests from different nodes, or perhaps it will become temporarily unavailable. Either way, consensus is broken and the entire blockchain dies.\n\nSo, what’s the workaround? Actually, it’s rather simple. Instead of a smart contract initiating the retrieval of external data, one or more trusted parties (""oracles"") creates a transaction which embeds that data in the chain. Every node will have an identical copy of this data, so it can be safely used in a smart contract computation.\n\nIn other words, an oracle pushes the data onto the blockchain rather than a smart contract pulling it in.\n\nWhen it comes to smart contracts causing events in the outside world, a similar problem appears. For example, many like the idea of a smart contract which calls a bank’s API in order to transfer money. But if every node is independently executing the code in the chain, who is responsible for calling this API?\n\nIf the answer is just one node, what happens if that particular node malfunctions, deliberately or not? And if the answer is every node, can we trust every node with that API\'s password? And do we really want the API called hundreds of times? Even worse, if the smart contract needs to know whether the API call was successful, we\'re right back to the problem of depending on external data.\n\nAs before, a simple workaround is available. Instead of the smart contract calling an external API, we use a trusted service which monitors the blockchain’s state and performs certain actions in response. For example, a bank could proactively watch a blockchain and perform money transfers which mirror the on-chain transactions. This presents no risk to the blockchain’s consensus because the chain plays an entirely passive role.\n\nLooking at these two workarounds, we can make some observations.\n\nFirst, they both require a trusted entity to manage the interactions between the blockchain and the outside world. While this is technically possible, it undermines the goal of a decentralized system.\n\nSecond, the mechanisms used in these workarounds are straightforward examples of reading and writing a database. An oracle which provides external information is simply writing that information into the chain. And a service which mirrors the blockchain’s state in the real world is doing nothing more than reading from that chain. In other words, any interaction between a blockchain and the outside world is restricted to regular database operations.\n\nWe’ll talk more about this fact later on.\n\n2. Enforcing on-chain payments\n\nHere’s another proposal that we tend to hear a lot: using a smart contract to automate the payment of coupons for a so-called ""smart bond"". The idea is for the smart contract code to automatically initiate the payments at the appropriate times, avoiding manual processes and guaranteeing that the issuer cannot default.\n\nOf course, in order for this to work, the funds used to make the payments must live inside the blockchain as well, otherwise a smart contract could not possibly guarantee their payment.\n\nRecall that a blockchain is just a database, in this case a financial ledger containing the issued bond and some cash. So, when we talk about coupon payments, what we’re actually talking about are database operations which take place automatically at an agreed time.\n\nWhile this automation is technically feasible, it suffers from a financial difficulty. If the funds used for coupon payments are controlled by the bond\'s smart contract, then those payments can indeed be guaranteed. But this also means those funds cannot be used by the bond issuer for anything else. And if those funds aren’t under the control of the smart contract, then there is no way in which payment can be guaranteed.\n\nIn other words, a smart bond is either pointless for the issuer, or pointless for the investor. And if you think about it, this is a completely obvious outcome.\n\nFrom an investor’s perspective, the whole point of a bond is its attractive rate of return, at the cost of some risk of default. And for the issuer, a bond\'s purpose is to raise funds for a productive but somewhat risky activity, such as building a new factory.\n\nThere is no way for the bond issuer to make use of the funds raised, while simultaneously guaranteeing that the investor will be repaid. It should not come as a surprise that the connection between risk and return is not a problem that blockchains can solve.\n\n3. Hiding confidential data\n\nAs I’ve written about previously, the biggest challenge in deploying blockchains is the radical transparency which they provide.\n\nFor example, if 10 banks set up a blockchain together, and two conduct a bilateral transaction, this will be immediately visible to the other eight. While there are various strategies for mitigating this problem, none beat the simplicity and efficiency of a centralized database in which a trusted administrator has full control over who can see what.\n\nSome people think that smart contracts can solve this problem. They start with the fact that each smart contract contains its own miniature database, over which it has full control. All read and write operations on this database are mediated by the contract’s code, making it impossible for one contract to read another’s data directly. (This tight coupling between data and code is called encapsulation, and is the foundation of the popular object-oriented programming paradigm).\n\nSo, if one smart contract can’t access another’s data, have we solved the problem of blockchain confidentiality? Does it make sense to talk of hiding information in a smart contract? Unfortunately, the answer is no.\n\nBecause even if one smart contract can’t read another’s data, that data is still stored on every single node in the chain. For each blockchain participant, it’s in the memory or disk of a system which that participant completely controls. And there’s nothing to stop them reading the information from their own system, if and when they choose to do so.\n\nHiding data in a smart contract is about as secure as hiding it in the HTML code of a web page. Sure, regular web users won\'t see it, because it\'s not displayed in their browser window. But all it takes is for a web browser to add a ‘View Source’ function (as they all have), and the information becomes universally visible.\n\nSimilarly, for data hidden in smart contracts, all it takes is for someone to modify their blockchain software to display the contract’s full state, and all semblance of secrecy is lost.\n\nA half-decent programmer could do that in an hour or so.\n\nWhat smart contracts are for\n\nWith so many things that smart contracts cannot do, one might ask what they’re actually for. But in order to answer this question, we need to go back to the fundamentals of blockchains themselves. To recap, a blockchain enables a database to be directly and safely shared by entities who do not trust each other, without requiring a central administrator.\n\nBlockchains enable data disintermediation, and this can lead to significant savings in complexity and cost.\n\nAny database is modified via ""transactions"", which contain a set of changes to that database which must succeed or fail as a whole. For example, in a financial ledger, a payment from Alice to Bob is represented by a transaction that (a) checks if Alice has sufficient funds, (b) deducts a quantity from Alice’s account and (c) adds the same quantity to Bob’s.\n\nIn a regular centralized database, these transactions are created by a single trusted authority. By contrast, in a blockchain-driven shared database, transactions can be created by any of that blockchain’s users. And since these users do not fully trust each other, the database has to contain rules which restrict the transactions performed.\n\nFor example, in a peer-to-peer financial ledger, each transaction must preserve the total quantity of funds, otherwise participants could freely give themselves as much money as they liked.\n\nOne can imagine various ways of expressing these rules, but for now there are two dominant paradigms, inspired by bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. The bitcoin method, which we might call ""transaction constraints"", evaluates each transaction in terms of: (a) the database entries deleted by that transaction and (b) the entries created.\n\nIn a financial ledger, the rule states that the total quantity of funds in the deleted entries has to match the total in those created. (We consider the modification of an existing entry to be equivalent to deleting that entry and creating a new one in its place).\n\nThe second paradigm, which comes from Ethereum, is smart contracts. This states that all modifications to a contract’s data must be performed by its code. (In the context of traditional databases, we can think of this as an enforced stored procedure.) To modify a contract’s data, blockchain users send requests to its code, which determines whether and how to fulfill those requests.\n\nAs in this example, the smart contract for a financial ledger performs the same three tasks as the administrator of a centralized database: checking for sufficient funds, deducting from one account and adding to another.\n\nBoth of these paradigms are effective, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. To summarize, bitcoin-style transaction constraints provide superior concurrency and performance, while Ethereum-style smart contracts offer greater flexibility.\n\nSo to return to the question of what smart contracts are for: Smart contracts are for blockchain use cases which can’t be implemented with transaction constraints.\n\nGiven this criterion for using smart contracts, I’m yet to see a strong use case for permissioned blockchains which qualifies.\n\nAll the compelling blockchain applications I know can be implemented with bitcoin-style transactions, which can handle permissioning and general data storage, as well as asset creation, transfer, escrow, exchange and destruction. Nonetheless, new use cases are still appearing, and I wouldn’t be surprised if some do require the power of smart contracts. Or, at the very least, an extension of the bitcoin paradigm.\n\nWhatever the answer turns out to be, the key to remember is that smart contracts are simply one method for restricting the transactions performed in a database.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a useful thing, and is essential to making that database safe for sharing. But smart contracts cannot do anything else, and they certainly cannot escape the boundaries of the database in which they reside.\n\nPencil and eraser image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Some may even accept Bitcoin as a preferred payment. However, the first hotel booking website to offer a cash-back rewards style program with Bitcoin, as well as the option to donate your rewards to charities like Bithope, Wikileaks and The Water Project is Warsaw, Poland-based HotelGo24.\n\nFor each hotel booking a customer makes on HotelGo24, they may receive up to a 5% equivalent reward in Bitcoin for their purchase. The amount of the reward they’ll receive is noted on the page of each potential booking they look at. The selection criteria is simple and straightforward. The user may choose to browse hotels in their local currency and select a range of prices, star ratings as well as from a list of amenities available. The exact amount of Bitcoin reward a customer will get is listed beneath the hotel’s details.\n\nNo customer account is required in order to search for and book a hotel. While the rewards that HotelGo24 offers are actual Bitcoin, a user cannot use Bitcoin to pay for their hotel. To purchase a reservation at a hotel a user must enter a major credit card through the checkout page. Upon checkout, the user is given an option to automatically donate their Bitcoin rewards to one of the 3 listed charities, or have the Bitcoin reward sent to their wallet address.\n\nThe website offers competitive pricing and rates compared to other hotel booking websites. Within the description of each individual hotel listing there is a detailed breakdown about the facilities and what comes with the booking. There is also an objective TripAdvisor.com window with the listings for users to review before making their purchase.\n\nWhile it would be even better for users of Bitcoin to be able to purchase their hotel reservations using Bitcoin, it’s still a useful model to raise awareness about Bitcoin by allowing users to earn rewards and donate them in the form of the cryptocurrency.

Once released, WAVES will allow anyone to issue their own custom tokens on the WAVES blockchain rather than using the Bitcoin blockchain like Counter-Party.\n\nKicking off their ICO with a massive 5000 BTC total in the first week, WAVES is off to a good start in attracting potential users. At the end of the campaign, a total of 85 million WAVES coins of the total number of coins will be distributed to the crowdfunding participants based on individual donations thanks to Ethereum’s smart contracts.\n\nWhile services such as Counter-Party also offer custom tokens, it is built on Bitcoin’s blockchain which can experience delays due to block size. Waves on the other hand, offers their own blockchain and the ability to establish crowdfunding campaigns, trading and aims to merge fiat and fintech.\n\nWith fiat integration, WAVES’ wallet will have the ability to hold fiat currencies such as USD, Euro and Yuan in the form of tokens along with other WAVES-based tokens without the need to download the blockchain.\n\nUnlike Ethereum which allows you to program the blockchain, WAVES will simplify the process by offering plug-ins to add functions to the blockchain which will be easier to use than to program, making it friendly towards all developers and users alike.\n\nFiat token support\n\n“We will be supporting fiat tokens, tied to major world currencies. They will be backed by existing financial institutions, who will provide market making for the assets, compliant with their KYC/AML. The structure is similar to Ripple gateways, it is not a market-peg, but a full backing by a third-party entity.” stated Sasha Ivanov, founder and CEO of the WAVES project in his Bitcoin Talk thread.\n\nUnlike traditional blockchain tokens which are not backed by fiat currencies, WAVES has the potential to break the barrier between traditional fiat systems and decentralized banking with this new form of digital token.\n\n“One of the goals will be also to create a protocol for token/asset transfer between blockchains. Imagine you have a token on NXT, ETH platform and would like to move this token to BTC colored coins or Waves blockchain.” said Ivanov in a blog post.\n\nSo far, the WAVES team is working on a lite client that does not require the download of the blockchain which should be available at the end of the ICO but only testnet WAVES is allowing the trading of WAVES tokens on exchanges before the mainnet launch.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

While we can’t say the same about centralized exchanges and trading platforms, the Bitcoin protocol is completely transparent and offers a certain degree of anonymity as well (pseudonymity). But as technology progresses, we now have entirely different use cases of blockchain technology on our hands. Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology has grown beyond being a public ledger keeping a record of all bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe application of blockchain technology is now being widely explored by banking and financial institutions across the world. There are many smart contracts being built using Bitcoin blockchain as well as Ethereum. the increasing applications and use cases for bitcoin blockchain also calls for the introduction of certain features suitable for particular industries.\n\nWhen it comes to the banking sector, they do not prefer public blockchain where anyone can go through their ledger on the blockchain. In such cases, a private blockchain can not only make things easier for the industry but also drive adoption.\n\nEthereum may have a solution for that. It includes smart contracts and homomorphic encryption.\n\nWhat is Homomorphic Encryption?\n\nIt is a method of performing calculations on encrypted data without decrypting them first. This offers a much-needed leeway to make use of the blockchain technology on an as-is basis. By using homomorphic encryption techniques to store data over the blockchain, a perfect balance can be created. There won’t be any significant changes in the blockchain properties. Meaning, it will still be a public blockchain. However, the data on the blockchain will be encrypted, taking care of the privacy concerns associated with public blockchains.\n\nThe use of homomorphic encryption technique will not only offer privacy protection, it will also allow ready access to encrypted data over public blockchain for auditing and other purposes. In order words, the use of homomorphic encryption to store data on public blockchain will offer the best of both public and private blockchains in one single package.\n\nPrivate blockchains are still in the exploratory phase, where companies like R3 and Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project are working on. R3 recently announced the launch of their private distributed ledger for the banking consortium called Corda. Corda is built specifically for the banking and financial sector. It is still undergoing trials.\n\nEthereum smart contracts using homomorphic encryption can offer similar features and greater control while keeping all the goodness of Ethereum intact.\n\nOne of the use cases of homomorphic encryption on the blockchain, as explained by Kobi Gurkan from Shield128 blockchain security platform, takes an Ethereum smart contract for managing employee expenses. In this use case, employees who do not want their peers to know about their expenses can encrypt the expense details and send it to a smart contract. The encrypted expense will then be added to the total expenses amount. In the end, when the accounts department of the company wants to analyze the expenditure can decrypt the final contract locally to get a detailed breakdown of the total expenses. It is as good as entering the details on a public ledger, but only the final authority will get to see the details. rest of the users who have access to the contract to add details will only see encrypted entries.\n\nEthereum and blockchain technology offers endless possibilities, with multiple ways to achieve a single goal. It is up to the developers to decide how they want to pursue it.\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC.', 'Steve Ehrlich is an associate and the lead analyst for emerging technologies at Spitzberg Partners, a boutique consulting firm headquartered in New York that advises innovative technology companies.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Ehrlich discusses blockchain technology from the perspective of regulators tasked with ensuring consumer data protection and privacy.\n\nI do not envy data protection authorities (DPAs).\n\nAlthough virtually everyone from the top leadership to the rank and file of these organizations is knowledgeable and driven by a sense of purpose, the pace of innovation makes it seem as if their feet are perpetually stuck in digital quicksand or on an escalator going the wrong direction.\n\nWhat specifically is keeping them so busy these days?\n\nIt begins with keeping tabs on US technology titans such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber and AirBnB. But another major challenge comes from tracking emerging trends in the use of tech and data. While watchdogs struggle to chase the latest developments in search, social media and cloud computing, new technologies are constantly coming across their desks.\n\nPart of a regulator\'s remit is to stay abreast of these innovations and understand their implications for data protection. Over the past few years, more resources have been diverted to study and respond to drones, connected devices, the use of technology in law enforcement, genetic testing, biometrics, etc.\n\nIt would be an understatement to call the load a full plate, and it is understandable why each of these technologies is receiving attention. Many already play a role in our lives, such as the Nest thermostat or Apple Touch ID.\n\nBeyond a growing prominence in the marketplace, these innovations also have one common factor that makes them a concern for regulators – They generate oceans of user data, destined to be warehoused in a ""cloud"" and mined for lucrative insights. Armed with new Big Data analytic techniques, these technologies give companies the means to increase their informational dominance over customers.\n\nBy contrast, blockchain does not fit easily into this mold and is still a ways off from affecting the average consumer.\n\nAs a less developed technology, regulators tend to give it lower priority, or no attention at all.\n\nTop of mind\n\nSo how do you get blockchain on their agendas?\n\nStart by highlighting blockchain\'s future potential. To get regulators out of their comfort zone, it is important to underscore that blockchain technologies offer a categorical upgrade over existing solutions and tools in the marketplace today.\n\nTherefore, it is important to embrace the opportunity blockchain presents to fundamentally turn the tables on the personal data economy. Or put another way – restore an individual’s ownership of their data.\n\nRegulators around the world are constantly working on initiatives to ensure data controllers and companies have the legitimate rights to collect data; user consent for processing it; and measures in place to ensure that individuals are able to take back their data and give it to a competitor (a rival bank, for instance) if they so choose.\n\nBlockchain-based identity solutions can flip the script, relying on cryptography, multi-signature technology and distributed computing power to restore an individual’s ""digital independence.""\n\nNext, it\'s best to tie the technology to today’s landscape.\n\nThis requires a multi-prong approach: First linking the concept to core data protection principles and then a comparing blockchain technology to analogous marketplace solutions, such as cloud computing.\n\nData protection principles\n\nRegulations today are primarily based on eight principles laid out by the OECD in 1980: collection limitation, data quality, purpose specification, use limitation, security safeguards, openness, individual participation and accountability.\n\nBlockchain-based technologies offer measurable advantages over existing technologies in the market on these criteria. For example, the use of new encryption-based authentication protocols will make identity theft significantly more difficult.\n\nAdditionally, future products built on blockchain can also provide a transparent means of ensuring companies are scrupulous with the manner in which they use and treat customer data.\n\nToday, it is expected that every company has in place a plain language ""privacy policy"" that details what personal data they will collect, how it will be used, how long it will be held, the ways in which people can obtain this data and other aspects of the data lifecycle.\n\nAfter consenting to the policy, customers are typically left to simply trust that the vendor will keep to its promise. However, through the use of blockchain and smart contracts these protocols can be encoded into business processes, which can be standardized through the use of certification schemes, programmatically ensuring that companies will live up to their word.\n\nBlockchain technology can also offer new solutions for maintaining company records, a task that will only grow in significance as businesses learn to capture more of their customers\' data. Companies around the world are increasingly being required to maintain a full accounting of their data processing and storage activities for auditing and compliance purposes.\n\nIn most cases, part of fulfilling these requirements entails tracking employee access to company data. This is a use-case tailor-made for a blockchain-based solution for managing, verifying and safeguarding company data.\n\nComparison to cloud computing\n\nTo illustrate the strengths blockchain holds in these core data principles, it is important to draw a contrast between blockchain and existing products on the market.\n\nWhen speaking with regulators regarding blockchain technology, I often spend time highlighting the difference between permissioned blockchains and open blockchains and ledgers. As the conversation gets a bit more involved, analogies are drawn between these types of blockchains and public, private and hybrid cloud solutions.\n\nGovernments are struggling to deal with the implications of cloud technologies from a regulatory point of view. Key concerns from their point of view include properly safeguarding data and ensuring that it is not misappropriated and remains confidential.\n\nAdditionally, the stakes are rising.\n\nGiven the growing popularity of cloud-based solutions, providers are starting to face increased scrutiny and penalties from regulators, even if they are merely a client or sub-contractor to the firm who uses their data-storage capabilities.\n\nTaking into account an appreciation for the specific use cases for a blockchain vs non-blockchain based solutions, it is easy to make the case that distributed ledger solutions and smart contracts offer advantages from the perspectives of transparency, security and purpose limitation.\n\nSetting expectations\n\nGiven that primary use cases are still centered on bitcoin and the financial industry, many DPAs will let financial regulators manage blockchain’s regulatory landscape.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that there will be any major developments, regulation or guidance from data protection authorities related to blockchain in the immediate future.\n\nHowever, regulators across the globe, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Article 29 Working Party in Europe and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada, issue comments or guidance with insight into how they see new technologies fitting into existing regulations and some of their primary concerns from a consumer protection point of view.\n\nAs blockchain technology continues to develop, I expect them to eventually start putting out discussion pieces as a prelude to formal guidance.\n\nWhen DPAs issue calls for information, it would also be well-worth industry members\' time to participate and submit comments.\n\nAt the same time, there are things that can be done right away. Developers and programmers in the space should learn about the OECD principles and relevant regulations as they build new products.\n\nAdditionally, regulators encourage certification schemes as a means of showing goodwill and alleviating their burden. For example, the upcoming European General Data Protection Regulation, which will replace the EU law enacted in 1995, encourages the use of certification regimes as a means of complying with regulations.\n\nCreating such a program would be a great start for blockchain\'s regulatory engagement in the data protection world.\n\nRadar image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Saudi Arabia threatens to sell off hundreds of billions – with a b – of USD worth of American assets if the bill holding the Saudi government responsible for any role in 9/11 is passed.\n\nAlso read: Is Igot Going the Mt Gox Way?\n\nSaudi Arabia Threatens US Economy\n\nEveryone in the world would like nothing more than ensuring the parties responsible for the 9/11 attacks are apprehended and brought to justice. Several people within the US Congress feel Saudi Arabia played some role in these attacks, and a new bill has been drafted to hold the kingdom responsible for whichever part they played in this horrible event. But at the same time, the Obama administration has urged Congress to block the bill from passing.\n\nIf this bill passed Congress through some miracle – or secret deals between representatives – the results would be catastrophic for the US economy. Keeping in mind how Saudi Arabia holds US$750 billion in Treasury securities and other US assets, liquidating such vast amounts would put a severe strain on the US Dollar, and set a dangerous precedent for the country’s economy.\n\nAlthough it is very doubtful the Saudi officials would go through with this move if the 9/11 bill passes, the situation has a lot of people on edge. Saudi Arabia seems willing to cripple their economy just to present a financial blow to their American counterparts. But in the bigger scheme of things, the debacle between the Saudi kingdom and the US is escalating at an accelerated pace.\n\nNeedless to say, this entire situation is causing a lot of frustration among families of the 9/11 victims as well. A significant portion of them feels Obama is protecting Saudi Arabia over US citizens. It is understandable people are upset, but this whole thing may very well be blown out of proportion, and involved parties must not lose track of the bigger picture here.\n\nEdwin M Truman of Peterson Institute for International Economics stated:\n\n“I think the Saudis were most likely making an empty threat. Selling hundreds of billions of dollars in American assets would not only be technically difficult to pull off, but would also very likely cause global market turmoil for which the Saudis would be blamed.Moreover, this event would destabilize the US Dollar, to which the Saudi riyal is pegged.”\n\nRegardless of the outcome, this scenario is putting a lot of strain on a very weak global financial ecosystem. Every country in the world holds foreign assets, which can be liquidated at any moment and plunge economies back into recession. It is all but impossible to make sense of all of these financial connections and who holds which assets, due to a lack of transparency.\n\nWhether or not Bitcoin and blockchain technology will be able to force a change in the financial sector over the coming years, remains to be seen. But stories like these go to show how little consumers have to say in financial matters through the banking system, and why Bitcoin might become a far more viable alternative if squabbles like these continue.\n\nSource: NY Times\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"

The company said this fund raise is part of its ongoing Series A round.\n\nThe funds will be utilised to expand the company’s reach in both domestic and international markets, and introduce Ethereum and other Blockchain innovations. The funds will also go into strengthening the marketing and engineering teams, increase the banking partners and develop the app, which will be launched by the end of this month. The company will increase the number of employees from 20 to 30 by the end of this year.\n\nHaving partnered with Axis Bank, Yes Bank and HDFC Bank, Delhi-based Coinsecure allows users to buy, sell and accept Bitcoin. Coinsecure in a statement said that enabling Bitcoin to go mainstream does not just mean creating the strongest platform for buying and selling Bitcoins but also to educate users on the merits of Blockchain technology to grow India’s Bitcoin user base.\n\nCoinsecure model\n\nFounded in July 2014 by Mohit Kalra and Benson Samuel, Coinsecure is registered as Secure Bitcoin Traders Pvt. Ltd. An ISO certified company, Coinsecure offers Bitcoin wallet, exchange, trading and merchant services along with other Blockchain based services. Blockchain consists of data structure blocks that maintains the transaction records against tempering and revision. The company has its Head Office in Delhi and the Research and Development division in Bangalore.\n\nIt launched a Bitcoin exchange on January 1, 2015. Coinsecure offers an algorithmic trading Bitcoin exchange, a Blockchain explorer, free APIs for all their products, a mock trading platform for users to try trading without real money and On-Chain and Off-Chain wallet services. The company now consistently handles over 3,000 BTCs a month in terms of volume.\n\n“We are growing by 30-40 percent in terms of customer’s acquisition. Our revenue comes from the 0.3 percent we charge consumers for exchanging Bitcoin. The coming years are all about improving our products, building new ones, and providing enterprise Blockchain solutions, to address some key pain points in the crypto space,” says Benson Samuel, CTO and Co-Founder of Coinsecure.\n\nA Scala developer, Benson has contributed to several open source projects over the years and is also a moderator of the India forum for Bitcoin.\n\n“Coinsecure is on the verge of delivering a solution for Indian merchants and users to engage with Bitcoin, and its experience, without any volatility or conversion risks,” says Mohit Kalra, Founder and CEO of Coinsecure. He is involved in several Bitcoin projects and is an angel investor.\n\nBitcoin in India: Not a distant dream\n\nThe concept of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin is still in its nascent stage in India and does not have regulatory clarity. A proper regulatory framework around Bitcoin will automatically increase the adoption rate among merchants and consumers in India. RBI governor Raghuram Rajan in a statement said that digital currencies such as bitcoin would be helpful in the transition towards a cashless society, as they become better and safer in the future.\n\nThe positive side of Bitcoin is that the fees are 2-3 percent lower than the fees imposed by credit card processors. In the past few years Bitcoin has witnessed worldwide adoption by multiple mainstream players, including Fortune 500 companies like Microsoft, Expedia and Dell. In many countries governments have played a very active role in allowing Bitcoin exchanges operate without the need for any commodity exchange license.\n\nEarlier, there was speculation that it was very hard for Bitcoin startups to raise funds. However with startups like Unocoin, Coinsecure and Zebpay raising funds this myth has been busted to an extent.\n\nBengaluru-based Unocoin raised $250,000 from Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Opportunity in 2014. Ahmedabad-based Zebpay raised $1 million in Series A funding, led by equity investor Arjun Handa, CMD and VP of Claris Life sciences, along with Amit Jindal, MD of Jindal worldwide, and other investors.\n\nAdditionally, there are also names like BTCXIndia, LocalBitcoins.com and Tingpay who are striving to make Bitcoin trading easier while gaining the mindshare of consumers. Even California-based Coinbase last year made its Bitcoin wallet available in India.\n\nAccording to Samuel Benson, India needs more learning outlets to generate mass interest about Bitcoin. Coinsecure conducts outreach programs across India to enable schools, colleges and IT/ ITES departments understand the bitcoin technology and implement the same.\n\nCoinsecure', 'According to the latest Theatrical Market Statistics report released by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), global box office revenues reached $38.3 billion in 2015, up 5 percent from 2014. But Chris Dodd, chief of the MPAA, said that if the issue of piracy could be tackled it would add a healthy $1.5 billion more to the movie industry’s bottom line.\n\nBut currently available piracy detection technologies are ineffective in tackling digital media piracy because most illegal downloads happen on peer-to-peer networks.\n\nCustos Media Technologies, a startup based in Stellenbosch, South Africa, recently unveiled a technology that uses Bitcoin to track pirated media.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Fred Lutz, chief operating officer at Custos, said that the process basically involves embedding an invisible and difficult-to-remove watermark into the digital content, the watermark in this case being a Bitcoin private key. If the watermarked content is then leaked there is a small Bitcoin reward that can be collected by the first person to find it.\n\n“The code that we embed throughout the movie is a Bitcoin private key, and we top-up the associated account with some bitcoins,” Lutz said. “We have a tool available publicly at Privateer.xyz with which anyone can read the watermark and extract the bitcoins. This means that a movie or ebook that goes out of the control of the intended recipient now has some vulnerability ? if it lands in the wild, the bitcoins will be extracted and we are notified through the blockchain that the funds were moved. We notify our clients of the identity of the customer that is associated with the private key and they can respond accordingly.”\n\nAccording to Lutz, Custos is a spinout from research done by him and his partners; G-J van Rooyen, and Herman Engelbrech, at the Media Lab at Stellenbosch University.\n\nLutz said that the initial seed funding for Custos came from Innovus, the Technology Transfer Office of Stellenbosch University, in the form of a $140,000 USD prize from the SeedStars World competition last year.\n\nLutz said Custos generated $265,000 USD in the second round of the seed funding, part of which came from a local angel investor and the rest from New York-based Digital Currency Group.\n\n“We are very fortunate to have investors that believe in the team, and see the potential of this new approach to content distribution,” Lutz said.\n\nBesides their anti-piracy solution, Custos Media Technology also offers a screener distribution platform, Screenercopy.com, that lets filmmakers distribute pre-release movies to reviewers or the media without having to worry about piracy leaks. They also offer ebook protection services in partnership with Erudition Digital.', 'Global Bitcoin payment processor BitPay has notified users to of a newly discovered Trojan virus that is affecting some bitcoin purchases.

According to Mohit Kalra, the Founder, and CEO of Coinsecure, “The funds raised by the company will be used to expand the company’s reach in both domestic and international markets. Coinsecure will also be using these funds to further explore global markets and to introduce Ethereum and other Blockchain innovations.”\n\nIn 2016, Indian companies are continuing to develop Bitcoin-related business. This January, Zebpay, India’s first bitcoin company announced it had raised $1 million in series ‘A Funding,' primarily led by private equity investors. Zebpay intended to use the funding to scale its Bitcoin and blockchain-based services, as well as divert some amount towards talent acquisition. The company, previously called BuySellBitco.in was started in late 2012 and was eventually rebranded in 2014. According to Sandeep Goenka, Co-founder, Zebpay, “Bitcoin companies in the U.S. have already attracted more than $1 billion in funding in the last two years alone. However, since RBI mentioned the potential of blockchain in the Indian context, we have seen a sudden increase in investor interest in Zebpay and in other Indian bitcoin companies, both from Indian as well as international investors.”\n\nBack in August 2014, Bengaluru-based Unocoin attracted a sum of $250,000 from the well-known Digital Currency Group (DCG), founded by Bitcoin enthusiast Barry Silbert. The company used the money in expanding its operations and is growing at a rapid pace. Unocoin has recently launched a merchant mobile application for facilitating acceptance of bitcoin by store owners without facing transaction fees, chargebacks and volatility risk. Other than Coinsecure, Unocoin, and Zebpay, LocalBitcoins.com and BTCXIndia are the main active bitcoin players in India.\n\nBitcoin's Potential\n\nThe cryptocurrency has great potential, given the huge remittances which are sent back home each year by Indians abroad. According to a release by the World Bank, “India was the largest remittance receiving country, with an estimated $72 billion in 2015, followed by China ($64 billion), and the Philippines ($30 billion).” With the huge cost and time saving that bitcoin remittance gateway can offer, people are sure to resort resorting to it if established systems to process such transactions are available.

The days ahead should see bigger investments, innovative apps, products, and enthusiasts which would boost not just bitcoin but the idea of a cryptocurrency."", 'Former New York regulator Benjamin Lawsky, who oversaw what many consider the most restrictive state bitcoin regulation known as BitLicense, now works as a counsel and media liaison for Axoni, a blockchain technology firm that uses blockchain in settling derivative transactions, according to Reuters.\n\nLawsky said he intended to start a consulting business when he announced his departure from the New York Department of Financial Services last spring, CCN reported. As a regulator, Lawsky had a reputation for consistently pushing for larger fines and stricter rules.\n\nLawsky’s firm, the Lawsky Group, plans to represent other blockchain clients. A member of the team is Matthew Anderson, who was a spokesman for the New York Department of Financial Services when it was developing the BitLicense.\n\n“We’ll be doing a broad range of financial consultancy … and some financial technology public relations,” said Anderson.\n\nThe Lawsky Group website says the firm provides counsel on financial services regulation, cybersecurity, cyber-risk, compliance, new financial technologies, consumer protection, crisis management, privacy, anti-money laundering controls, and investigations in the insurance, banking, and related industries.\n\nLawsky last June said he wanted to implement “guard rails that protect consumers and root out illicit activity without stifling innovation.”\n\nBitcoin Community Mixed\n\nThe bitcoin community has mixed reactions to Lawsky’s new role.\n\nPamela Morgan, CEO of Third Key Solutions, which consults for companies that use digital currency, said the most interesting aspect of Lawsky’s new venture is that it shows the close relationship between regulators and those who are regulated. She called Lawsky’s new role “crony capitalism at its finest.”\n\nAdam Draper, CEO of venture capital firm Boost VC, called it fantastic that Lawsky has entered the private sector and continued to support bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nSome noted that Lawsky’s ability to interact with the media as a regulator is a strength he now uses in his new role.\n\nAlso read: Circle Internet Financial receives New York State’s first BitLicense\n\nLawsky Defended BitLicense\n\nLawsky said his goal for the controversial BitLicense was to establish a balance between protecting consumers and allowing software developers the ability to create bitcoin products.\n\nThe BitLicense drew criticism from bitcoin companies, investment firms and advocacy organizations. Critics believed the BitLicense would become a model for other states and make it difficult for bitcoin services to expand.\n\nErik Voorhees, founder and CEO of ShapeShift, the Switzerland-based digital currency exchange, compared Lawsky’s bitcoin crackdown to North Korean communism.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Facebook.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Crypto Show recently interviewed Johnny Dilley, who runs strategy at Blockstream. Dilley shared his views on the future of Bitcoin’s block size limit, and explained why he’s not worried that a solution has yet to be chosen. Dilley’s calm demeanor in regard to the block size issue seems to be partially based on his excitement over various improvements that are making their way to Bitcoin via soft forks.\n\nThat a Hard Fork Hasn’t Happened Is Bullish for Bitcoin\n\nWhen asked about the lack of a hard fork to a larger block size limit up to this point, Dilley said that nothing is likely to change over the short term. He explained:\n\n“I think, today, we’re still no closer to any short-term movement (six months to a year) on the block size issue. That just has to do with the fact that driving consensus in a system that’s designed to not force anyone to do anything is difficult ? and that’s actually a good thing.”\n\nDilley expounded on his view, which has been also been expressed by Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields and others, that the difficulties with coming to consensus on changes in Bitcoin is a good thing. The former member of the Pantera Capital team stated:\n\n“The fact that there is considerable tension and the fact that a hard fork hasn’t happened is actually the most-encouraging, most-bullish sign for Bitcoin that there’s been in two years. It means that the system works. The fact that it’s difficult to make controversial changes to Bitcoin is a really good sign. It means it’s very resilient to attempts to overturn outstanding or current governance status.”\n\nDilley added a disclaimer to his bullish tone, stating, “To be clear, I’m the most bullish Bitcoiner I know.”\n\nNo One Entity Has Control Over the Block Size Limit\n\nIn terms of what kind of change will eventually be seen in Bitcoin’s block size limit, Dilley said, “We will get to some sort of adaptive block size solution.”\n\nBitPay co-founder and CEO Stephen Pair’s simple, adaptive block size limit is the one flexible solution that has garnered the most attention up to this point; however, many similar proposals have been made over the years.\n\nIn terms of how a final decision will be made, Dilley added, “I don’t think any individual or institution really has any control over what that final state looks like.”\n\nAlthough Bitcoin has not hard forked to a larger block size yet, much of the community, including Dilley, is encouraged by the various improvements, such as CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and Segregated Witness, that are currently being tested and rolled out onto the network.\n\nExcitement for BIP 9, Also Known as Version Bits\n\nDilley mentioned a variety of improvements that are coming to Bitcoin, but he seemed most excited about BIP 9 (Version Bits), which was recently used for the first time in the release of Bitcoin Core 0.12.1. This is a change to the way in which soft forks are rolled out, and it will allow many soft forks to be deployed at the same time.\n\n“That’ll be a massive and strict improvement for Bitcoin’s ability to get multiple things in flight at once,” Dilley said.\n\nIn terms of how upgrades have been made in the past, Dilley added, “This sequential methodology that we’ve been working off of has actually slowed our ability to roll out the types and kinds of things that Bitcoin needs to really thrive.”\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

However, he told Bitcoin Magazine, ""I think everyone who actually attended the meeting would disagree with what was stated in the article [posted below].""\n\nBitcoin Classic is the latest attempt to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit via a hard fork initiated by miners running an alternative to Bitcoin Core, but it appears that the relatively new software client may already be on its last legs. According to various sources familiar with a meeting in Beijing on March 30, supporters of an increase to the Bitcoin block size limit were unable to convince the Chinese mining community to implement BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 109 without support from Bitcoin Core contributors.\n\nBitcoin Core Supporters Not Invited\n\nIt was the intention of some participants to convince the Chinese mining community to adopt BIP 109 without the blessing of Bitcoin Core, which would, with support from 75 percent of the network hashrate, lead to an increase in the block size limit to 2 megabytes via a hard fork. The supporters of an increase in the block size limit also discussed a possible crisis that could ensue if the limit was not raised before the upcoming block reward halving.\n\nBitfury CIO Alex Petrov and others (who preferred to remain anonymous) have confirmed that anyone perceived to be associated with Bitcoin Core was not invited to the meeting. This includes Bitcoin Core contributors and various supporters of the Bitcoin Core roadmap. For example, Petrov was explicitly told that he was not allowed to enter the venue where the meeting was held until the discussions were over.\n\nThis is a similar setup to the meeting that took place in Hong Kong earlier this year between supporters of the Bitcoin Core roadmap and the Chinese mining community, although BTCC COO Samson Mow, who put that meeting together, told Bitcoin Magazine that FinalHash CTO Marshall Long was the only individual who was specifically not wanted at that event. Having said that, Bitcoin Classic supporter Peter Ng did attend the Hong Kong meeting.\n\nChinese Miners Prefer to Fork with Bitcoin Core\n\nThe details of exactly what was said during the meeting are still relatively unknown to outsiders at this point, but sources claim that one end result of the event is clear: Representatives of the Chinese mining community have no intention of deviating from the previous agreement made in Hong Kong as long as Bitcoin Core continues to implement improvements for scaling. Mow, who has spoken with multiple individuals who attended the meeting, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“Basically, [the BIP 109 delegation] came over with an arrogant attitude and tried to dictate who could and could not attend. They were not able to present a convincing argument, and the general vibe is that they’re going nowhere. ‘Train wreck’ would be a suitable term to describe their efforts in Beijing.”\n\nMow added, “This is based on multiple sources, and my opinion is that it is generally known [among Bitcoin miners and companies in China].”\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin industry executives, such as the CEOs of Blockchain and Coinbase, at least one developer attempted to convince miners to increase the block size limit via BIP 109. According to sources, that developer was Gavin Andresen, who authored the improvement proposal.\n\nThere are also rumors that miners may have been offered extra money to abandon Bitcoin Core for Bitcoin Classic. According to an anonymous source who was at the meeting, money was discussed, but it was in the context of protecting the network after a hypothetical hard fork had been activated. Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd recently claimed these sorts of discussions have happened in the past. Andresen responded to Todd’s statement on Reddit. He commented:\n\n“That is the way Bitcoin consensus works. Majority hashpower wins, unless they try to force through a change that is rejected by majority economic power (exchanges, merchants, users). The block size limit is a change that the economic majority has been SCREAMING FOR for a long time.”\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nSince the vast majority of hashing power would like to honor the previous Hong Kong agreement and stick with Bitcoin Core, it appears that the only hard fork in Bitcoin’s near future is going to come from Bitcoin Core developers. Bitcoin Core contributors have been able to stick to their December roadmap, and new improvements have been released in a timely manner. At this point, a change to another, hard-fork-inducing software client seems unlikely.\n\nFor the supporters of larger blocks, the goal is to get an increase in the block size limit before the upcoming halving in an effort to avoid a possible “doomsday scenario.” Whether this goal will be achieved remains unclear.\n\nSupport for Bitcoin Classic stood at roughly 5 percent of the network hashrate at the time this article was published.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Here is how you can invest in Bitcoin in the UK for example. Also while you read the article, you might want to do something about making it easier for people in the UK to use the latest in Fintech by getting banks not to be so Bitcoin averse.

Now, your average spoiled American university girl can have a great weekend using only Bitcoin.\n\nMeet Alyson\n\nThough Bitcoin is a currency that is recognized by most people across the developed world, it can still be seen as a facet of the tech industry, with only the world’s most technologically literate using it in any meaningful way.\n\nHowever, this is no longer true, as members of all social groups can find a use for cryptocurrency.\n\nAs an example of such, we will take you through a day in the life of a fictional “basic bitch,” one of the unlikeliest people to show an interest in crypto, to demonstrate that Bitcoin is for everyone.\n\nMeet Alyson. She’s a 21-year-old American university student in this hypothetical scenario. She loves yoga, shopping, and hanging out with her friends.\n\nNormally, she would be the last person in the world to use cryptocurrency, but her nerdy uncle who works for Coinbase gave her a whole Bitcoin for her high school graduation back in 2013. When she saw a Facebook post of his (her parents made her friend him) about how that one coin was now worth over four times as much, she knew she had to find her private key and password.\n\nGyft\n\nAlyson barely figured out how to work her wallet, and didn’t have the patience to be able to sell her Bitcoin via an exchange or other service.\n\nLuckily, she found Gyft, a service where she could buy gift cards to all her favorite stores with Bitcoin on the spot.\n\nAfter installing the app on her iPhone, she texted her best friends and arranged a trip to the mall.\n\nCoffee and lunch\n\nWhat day could begin without a proper caffeine fix? iPhone in hand, Alyson headed to Starbucks, and while waiting in line used the first of her Bitcoin to buy a gift card with her Gyft app.\n\nOne venti pumpkin spice latte (#PSL) later and a big smile on her face, she was ready for the rest of the day.\n\nNext, Alyson met with her friends for lunch at Panera. After failing to explain to them what Bitcoin was or how to use it, she offered to use it to buy all of them lunch.\n\nOne quick transaction later, she had a Panera gift card on her phone that she successfully used to cover everyone’s meal of broccoli cheddar soup, chicken avocado BLTs, and Fuji apple chicken salad (her friend Alyssa was on a diet).\n\nShopping mall\n\nOnce at the shopping mall, the team used the Gyft app’s gift card selection as a guide on which stores to go to. First they went to American Eagle, where Alyson purchased a new pair of jeans.\n\nNext up was Bath and Body Works, where the whole crew indulged on lotion and facial scrubs.\n\nAfter that, Alyson just couldn’t resist buying that cute little top the mannequin in the window of Express was wearing, and although she stays away from Hot Topic (since that’s where all the creepy goth kids go), she absolutely had to buy the adorable stuffed Grumpy Cat they were selling.\n\nTo finish up the trip, she got a new purse at Saks Off 5th, loaded up on makeup at Sephora, and got a sexy new set of lingerie at Victoria’s Secret in case she would meet that special someone.\n\nDinner, movie and beyond\n\nFinally, Alyson joined her gang of friends for dinner at the Cheesecake Factory, and afterwards caught a movie, all courtesy of Bitcoin via Gyft.\n\nLater that night, she used Bitcoin directly to buy a cute new pair of flats at Overstock.com as she planned the next day of grocery shopping at her favorite organic food store Whole Foods.\n\nBitcoin is now viable for all social groups\n\nIn addition to being accepted at more and more establishments, Bitcoin has also accrued a large enough network of third party companies to make living entirely off of cryptocurrency a reality for much of the world.\n\nWhen a technology finds comfortable use in the hands of a young, popular American girl, it’s a sign that said technology is ready for mass adoption.', 'Taavet Hinrikus, CEO of TransferWise, discusses how his company is going after the world\'s largest financial institutions, one small transaction at a time.\n\nExactly three months ago, a well-known bitcoin developer, Mike Hearn, wrote a post on Medium that rocked the community of people who believe in the future of the digital currency and its technology. Bitcoin, he wrote, has failed. “It has failed because the community has failed… Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse.” The post led to screaming headlines about the end of bitcoin.\n\nAnd yet, the industry plugs along. The currency is trading at $430 USD. Transaction volume (the number of bitcoin transactions per day) is higher now than it was before Hearn’s post, according to a tracker at Blockchain.info. Just this week, the Wall Street Journal profiled a top ETF (exchange-traded fund) attorney who is advocating for a bitcoin ETF, the same effort that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are pushing.\n\nBarry Silbert, CEO of the Digital Currency Group, reflected this week, “Hearnado is over.”\n\n@barrysilbert Close your eyes and click you heel 3 times..then keep saying to yourself, ""Bitcoin is dead, bitcoin is dead, bitcoin is dead"" — Trev Daniel (@TrvDaniel) April 15, 2016\n\nMaybe not. If you ask Taavet Hinrikus, CEO of international-payments app TransferWise, “Bitcoin, I think we can say, is dead. There is no traction, no one is using bitcoin. The bitcoin experiment, I think we can say, is over.”\n\nHinrikus made the comments in an interview with Yahoo Finance, during a visit to discuss his company’s service launching in Mexico this week. “What really happened was a gold rush,” he continued. “People bought bitcoin because they thought it would be worth more tomorrow. And a lot of people got lucky. But we’re not seeing real people use bitcoin. And we don’t know what problem it solves. Now, blockchain, I think, is a genius advancement in technology. But I’m not sure we’re seeing yet where to apply it. I’m pretty excited about R3 and Digital Asset Holdings. I think there are many areas where using blockchain is great, but it’s still early days.”\n\nHe’s not alone in either opinion: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, for one, has also said that bitcoin is “doomed,” and has also drawn a distinction between the currency and its underlying ledger technology, the blockchain. His bank, along with more than 40 others, has signed on to a consortium to test blockchain technology for their transaction rails.\n\nOf course, TransferWise isn’t a bitcoin company. But the company’s proposition to customers is faster transfer times, and smaller transfer fees, on international remittances. Bitcoin, as a technology, has the same appeal (among many other uses): instant transfers and tiny fees, circumventing big, expensive, sluggish banks or wire services. Startups like TransferWise, and Dwolla, and a host of others that have nothing to do with bitcoin are nonetheless in the same general pool of financial technology, or more specifically, digital payments.\n\nThe bold claim about bitcoin’s death would mean more, and be more alarming or divisive among the bitcoin community, coming from a bitcoin executive. (After all, one could make the case that bitcoin is a competitor to TransferWise, which deals in fiat currency.) But Hinrikus is no newcomer to fintech: TransferWise has raised nearly $100 million from huge names in tech investing like Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Richard Branson, and before co-founding TransferWise, Hinrikus was the first hire at Skype and worked there five years as its director of strategy.\n\nWhen asked about bitcoin, Hinrikus began by saying, “We’ve certainly paid lots of attention to bitcoin and blockchain.” If tech entrepreneurs like Hinrikus feel they no longer need to keep paying attention, that could be a problem for the coin and its future viability.\n\n\n\n--\n\nDaniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering sports business and technology.\n\nRead more:\n\nBitcoin community disputes use of the term ‘Internet of Money’\n\nHow big banks are paying lip service to the blockchain\n\nHere’s how you can invest in the blockchain\n\nBitcoin\'s biggest investor just bought its biggest news site', 'Digital gold is starting to look slightly more stable than its physical counterpart.

A Reddit post noted that the company decided to scrap its infrastructure and build a new and safe environment.\n\n“By design, ShapeShift doesn’t hold customer balances, so even in the case of a security breach, there is no customer money at risk,” Voorhees noted in a Reddit post. “However, a portion of our own hot wallet inventory funds were taken, but nothing that will interfere with operations once our new environment is online. This is also by design.”\n\nFor the few customers who had pending orders processing when the site went offline, ShapeShift will return the funds within 24 hours.\n\nForensic Audit Report\n\nShapeshift’s forensic auditor, Ledger Labs, is preparing a report of the technical findings of the incidents in which about $230,000 was lost from three hacks within a month. Some personal and system identifying information has been redacted from the report that will be made public.\n\nAn employee who has since been terminated carried out the first theft while a hacker to whom the employee sold information carried out more thefts. Some of the funds have been recovered, and no customer funds were lost or at risk.\n\nShapeShift discovered a theft of 315 bitcoin on March 14. The company quickly determined an employee committed the theft and reported the incident to law enforcement and filed a civil suit against the individual.\n\nShapeShift was able to keep the site running without interruption. The company believed it would be able to recover the stolen property.\n\nA Second Theft Occurs\n\nShapeShift spent two weeks working on new infrastructure and was about to move the service to a new host on April 7 when it noticed three hot wallets were hacked: bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin (approximately 97 BTC, 3600 ETH and 1900 LTC). Because ShapeShift was initially unable to find out how the hacks occurred, it took the site offline.\n\nThe company cycled all the keys and in 24 hours put up new infrastructure on an entirely new host.\n\nIn the course of the rebuild, ShapeShift established communication with the hacker, who said the rogue employee from the prior month’s theft had provided the information to carry out the second attack.\n\nA Third Infrastructure\n\nShapeShift redeployed on a third infrastructure on a Friday evening. The next morning, Ethereum and bitcoin had again been stolen from the new hot wallets: 2200 ETH and 57 BTC. This theft occurred less than 48 hours after the prior theft. None of the keys used in the theft had been shared with the previous infrastructure.\n\nMichael Perkin of Ledger Labs initiated a forensic audit.\n\nIn the next few days, the hacker, using the name Rovion Vavilov, explained via two chat sessions how both breaches occurred using information purchased from the former employee.\n\nShapeShift decided to re-architect the infrastructure with enhanced security methods and protocols under Perkin’s direction. The service was kept offline during the infrastructure rebuilding and the investigation.\n\nShapeShift has recovered some of the funds and believes there is potential to recover more from the person responsible.\n\nAlso read: Crypto exchange ShapeShift’s hack an insider job\n\nMore To Come\n\nVoorhees said he will publish a longer narrative detailing the entire event.\n\n“Existing in Bitcoinland is a pioneering struggle against many threats and challenge,” Voorhees noted on Reddit. “We’ll use the opportunity to build even bigger, better, and more resilient infrastructure.

Two concepts often brought up during these sorts of discussions are the Lightning Network and sidechains.\n\nBlockstream is in a unique position when it comes to these Bitcoin improvements, as it has the funds and incentives to work on both of these concepts simultaneously. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell shared his views on sidechains as a scalability solution and why the Lightning Network will be a better option over the long term.\n\nImplementing Bitcoin Classic as a Sidechain\n\nSome members of the Bitcoin community have wondered whether it would be a good idea to implement changes to Bitcoin’s block size limit via a sidechain. In fact, one of the key points made by Bitcoin Hivemind’s Paul Sztorc in his drivechain proposal was that sidechains would allow Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT to be implemented via this technology.\n\nWhile Maxwell agreed that this sort of functionality is possible, he didn’t seem convinced that it would be of much use. He explained:\n\n“Our greatest motivation for the sidechain concept in Bitcoin was being able to better satisfy mutually exclusive objectives for the system. However, sidechains by themselves do not fundamentally change the scaling limitations of a global broadcast system, though they should provide security partitioning if an experimental chain should fail.”\n\nIn other words, splitting sections of the network onto various sidechains does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin can then scale to an infinitely larger number of transactions per second.\n\nThe Lightning Network as a Better Option\n\nWhile many believe sidechains could be Bitcoin’s long-term solution to the scalability issue, Maxwell sees the Lightning Network as a better option. This is the exact opposite opinion recently shared by Bitcoin Core contributor and Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik on a recent episode of Bitcoin Uncensored.\n\nGarzik is a fan of the Lightning Network concept, but he still thinks there are too many unanswered questions associated with it for it to be viewed as Bitcoin’s one, true solution to scaling. It should be noted that Garzik admits these sorts of issues also exist for sidechains.\n\nIn terms of a sidechain’s ability to help Bitcoin scale, Maxwell told Bitcoin Magazine, “It may be technically possible to have a low-value, low-assurance and more micropayments-focused sidechain, within limits.”\n\nHe then clarified, “However, Lightning, once at release stage, offers a more compelling scaling solution that can really position the Bitcoin ecosystem for large-scale Bitcoin retail use and new, higher-scale micropayments use cases.”\n\nBitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo discussed some of the micropayments-related use cases of the Lightning Network at Blockchain Agenda San Diego late last year. Some of the use cases mentioned by Lombrozo included: lower-cost paywalls, Joystream (a BitTorrent client that incentivizes seeders with bitcoins), decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer bandwidth sales.\n\nMany People are Working on the Lightning Network\n\nMuch like sidechains, many companies and individuals are working on bringing a useful version of the Lightning Network to Bitcoin.\n\nMaxwell noted, “At least five companies as well as many individuals are actively developing Lightning, and much of the code and development is open in a similar model to Bitcoin.”\n\nRusty Russell, who previously worked on the network subsystem for the Linux kernel, is developing an implementation of the Lightning Network at Blockstream, and the original co-creators of the concept, Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja, are also working on their own version of the layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin. Poon recently let it be known that he expects a functional version of his and Dryja’s Lightning Network to be available this summer, while Russell is less certain his implementation will be made available by that time.\n\nAmiko Pay and Stroem are two other projects similar to the Lightning Network that are currently in various stages of development.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Although some say the killer applications for the peer-to-peer digital cash system have yet to arrive, many people understand the potential of this open system for online value transfer. The Internet completely revolutionized how information travels around the world, and Bitcoin could have the same impact on money, payments and many other aspects of finance.\n\nPermissionless Finance\n\nOne of the key innovations of the Internet was that it enabled permissionless publication of information. While a handful of media companies held tight control over information and news in the past, anyone with a Facebook or Twitter account can now instantly turn into a reporter on the scene of an interesting event.\n\nBitcoin offers a similar transition to a more decentralized version of online finance. Instead of getting permission from PayPal, Visa or MasterCard to accept online payments, anyone can instantly sell their goods and services for Bitcoin; it only takes a Bitcoin wallet to get started. Although online drug markets have existed in the past, these sorts of uncensored marketplaces become more practical in a world where Bitcoin exists. This is not to say these markets are morally right or wrong. They are simply an illustration of the permissionless nature of Bitcoin payments.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin requires permission from no one on a technical level, legal barriers to entry still exist when it comes to offering financial services on top of the blockchain. Regulations tend to come into play when entrepreneurs are taking custody of their users’ bitcoins. Of course, it’s still possible to create new p2p protocols for financial services, which can be viewed as nothing more than software. An example of this concept in action is JoinMarket, which is a way for Bitcoin users to get a return on their holdings by offer liquidity to CoinJoin transactions.\n\nBitcoin Could Change How the Internet Works\n\nBitcoin also has the potential to completely change the way the Internet works. The creation of a form of true digital cash allows applications to experiment with new incentive structures and monetization models.\n\nThe most common monetization model on the Internet has evolved to the point where it’s all about tracking users’ movements and selling that data to third parties. Brave Software is a startup that hopes to fight against this trend by way of a new browser. The idea is to provide users with better privacy while browsing the web and eventually have users choose to make small Bitcoin payments to content creators rather than becoming a product for advertisers. In the meantime, the browser uses ad-blocking technology to replace pop-ups and third-party cookies with less-intrusive advertisements.\n\n21 is another startup in the Bitcoin ecosystem that sees entirely new types of payments becoming possible thanks to the peer-to-peer digital cash system. Part of the mindset here is to view Bitcoin as a system resource rather than a currency. Having some bitcoins on devices by default may be useful in creating effective markets for sharing excess bandwidth, storage and other system resources. Bitcoin may enable a future where the specs of a particular device are less important because system resources can be automatically purchased with Bitcoin on p2p markets in the background.\n\nA Complete Revolution in Money\n\nOne last thing to keep in mind when it comes to Bitcoin as a commodity or currency is that this is a true revolution in money. Bitcoin has specific implications when it comes to a government’s ability to have control over the economy. Whether it’s to avoid capital controls, inflation, censorship of payments, bail-ins or any other economic policy, citizens now have the ability to opt-out of the traditional system entirely via Bitcoin. Although gold has been viewed as the main hedge against specific government actions in the past, Bitcoin’s role in this regard may increase as more commerce and general economic activity moves online.\n\nThe Internet weakened centralized control over information, and Bitcoin could do the same for money.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

This year the transition continued with all vendors accepting Android Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.\n\nThe shift aims to increase sales of food, drinks and merchandise, as well as to move attendance lines faster and reduce the number of thefts of cash and plastic cards.\n\nCoachella festival-goers prefer cashless payments\n\nThis year the transition continued with all vendors accepting Android Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay through POS provider Squares mobile wallet reader, allowing attendees to pay using their mobile wallets on their smartphones and smartwatches.\n\nWith a lineup of performers like Ice Cube, Guns N’ Roses, Kanye West, Snoop Dogg and Ellie Goulding and an attendance of stars running around who include the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and the Jenner sisters, it’s no wonder Coachella has become the best-attended and highest-grossing music festival in the world with attendance at 99,000 a day over six days.\n\nCoachella's six-day gross of more than $84.3 million last year dwarfed the competition.\n\nGopi Sangha, director of digital strategy at the music and arts festival organizer Goldenvoice, says to Forbes:\n\n“Coachella has been rather militantly cash only for the long duration of its lifespan, but over the past three years we’ve been watching our sales and seeing credit card demand here and at other festivals really scaling heavily - this is a trend that couldn’t be ignored and denied; it’s the way consumers want to complete transactions onsite.”\n\nPartnership with American Express\n\nNoting that 80 per cent of the youngest demographic pays electronically at some Goldenvoice festivals, Gopi adds:\n\n“The mobile drive is insatiable for us, we’re constantly on the search to make the experience a little bit more seamless for the fans and bring down the barrier of logistics so fans can really enjoy the art, the show and the atmosphere we create, and not be burdened down if the lines are held up and all those logistical bottlenecks.”\n\nAmerican Express has entered into a digital partnership with Coachella using their existing iBeacon technology which enables American Express members to link their card to the app and, by reading location data, gives users the chance to win rewards and enhance their festival experience based on their exact location.\n\nNumerous requests to accept Bitcoin\n\nAmy Marino, vice president of digital communications and design strategy at American Express, says to Forbes:\n\n“When it comes to cashless, just as a festival goer myself, I don’t want to have things in my pockets. You want to have as little as possible, but the one thing you’ve always got with you is your mobile device. For Coachella, where so much of your experience, your itinerary, the way that you are meeting up with your friends is done through your mobile device, this seemed like a no brainer where we should go to add value.”\n\nThe festival-goers have been requesting Bitcoin acceptance at this event on social networking sites and on the Coachella forums from 2014 to now.\n\nWith the speed that this mobile-based payment transition has appeared in the last three years, there is hope that when it penetrates into the mainstream as a payment type, maybe bitcoin could be an option at the event in 2017.""]"
04/20/2016,"['Early April’s leak of documents detailing how global elites hide their money has put a new spotlight on the issue of financial secrecy. Power players throughout the world have been connected to shell companies set up by Mossack Fonseca, the law firm in Panama that was the victim of the breach.\n\nThe Panama Papers have already displaced the Prime Minister of Iceland, Spain’s industry minister, the CEO of an Austrian bank and — ironically — the head of Transparency International’s Chile branch. Thousands of protesters have also called on British Prime Minister David Cameron to resign. In response to the revelations, appeals for reform came fast, and Europe’s five biggest economies have agreed to crack down on abuse by sharing information.\n\nREAD MORE: Is the United States enabling tax evasion?\n\nThe leak raises an age-old debate on how to balance privacy and transparency. Many libertarian-minded privacy advocates think the future of financial secrecy lies with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the blockchain technology that supports them. These digital currencies enable anonymous transactions and have become deeply associated with illicit financial dealings, like the drug trade on the dark web marketplace Silk Road.\n\nBut it’s not that simple. Blockchain advocates believe that the technology behind Bitcoin is the future of transparency, not secrecy.\n\nBlockchain advocates believe that the technology behind Bitcoin is the future of transparency, not secrecy.\n\nBitcoin’s crucial innovation is a distributed public ledger, known as a “blockchain,” that builds trust in a decentralized manner. Rather than relying on a single trusted source like a bank or clearinghouse, the blockchain defers to a decentralized swarm of machines. These computers verify transactions on the system. This network creates safety through redundancy, based on the consensus calculations of many machines. And thanks to the decentralization and strong cryptography, dishonest dealers cannot go back and alter historical transaction records. To do so would require altering thousands of ledgers that are distributed globally. Every transaction that has ever taken place is available for all to see, even if specific transactions can’t be traced to specific people. As one writer succinctly put it, the blockchain is “transparent and tamper-proof.”\n\nThis model of distributed trust offers a solution to the many social problems caused by a lack of open, trustworthy and agile recordkeeping. At a recent event hosted by the MIT Center for International Studies, Blockchain expert Michael Casey noted that automating trust through public ledgers will streamline business and government transactions, destroying information bottlenecks and improving transparency and efficiency.\n\nREAD MORE: Why one-percenters spend billions on foreign passports\n\nConsider, for instance, the domain of property titles. As Casey points out, the lack of a formal title for many in emerging markets means they cannot collateralize their wealth. A distributed, immutable ledger powered by blockchain technology might unlock the wealth stranded by poor record keeping and title systems.\n\nHonduras, where 60 percent of land is undocumented, is trying this out, and another project is rolling out in Ghana. Using the blockchain to build property title databases should be an economic boon for people in these countries. It’ll also strengthen their democracies, since these systems have built-in safeguards against tampering with records and thus corruption and expropriation.\n\nImagine a system in which “smart contracts” automatically pay photographers or musicians when their works are remixed.\n\nAnother area Casey noted as ripe for innovation is digital rights management. Blockchain technology could provide an elegant way for artists to get credited — and paid — for their work. Imagine a system in which “smart contracts” automatically pay photographers or musicians when their works are remixed. By automating the trust in such smart contracts, blockchain technology would minimize intellectual property theft and lower legal fees.\n\nDespite its reputation for anonymity, blockchain technology could also be used for identification. Governments could create public ledgers to record births and deaths, reducing fraud in the procurement of government services. These systems could also bolster privacy by ensuring only needed information was accessible to agencies.\n\nREAD MORE: Are skyscraper races a warning of economic chaos to come?\n\nHealth care is another area where blockchain could shine. The technology offers the prospect of encrypted medical records that hackers will have trouble tampering with. Estonia is currently implementing this kind of system. Other potential health care applications include drug verification and “DNA wallets.” With advances like these and others, storing medical information on the blockchain could simultaneously drive innovation in personalized medicine and also cut costs.\n\nThe biggest concerns banks have about blockchain technology is that it is too transparent, not too secretive.\n\nAs Casey points out, the new technology could also revolutionize supply chain management. Rather than having a single entity, like Wal-Mart, hoarding valuable information about the flow of goods, a public ledger would allow everyone to see what’s where and when. Using a blockchain would also let recipients of a good to understand its origin and ensure its authenticity. It may even enable origin-to-destination validation.\n\nDespite the potential for anonymity in financial transactions that Bitcoin offers, its underlying technology, the blockchain, is likely to make the world a much more transparent, democratic and efficient place. It shouldn’t be lost on us, as Casey noted, that the biggest concerns banks have about the technology is that it is too transparent, not too secretive.\n\nHowever depressing the Panama Papers revelations are, we can take solace in the fact that the future likely belongs to openness, not secrecy.', 'It has been said plenty of times in the past and it’ll be said again in the future. Taavet Hinrikus, CEO of TransferWise, a popular peer-to-peer international money transfer service has stated that bitcoin, is dead.\n\nTransferWise is a prominent player in the Fintech space. Founded in 2010, the money transfers service is among the leading remittance services in the world. In six years of the company’s existence, it has raised just under $100 million in equity funding with Richard Branson and Andreessen Horowitz among the notable investors.\n\nIn comments made during an interview with Yahoo Finance, Taavet Hinrikus, CEO of TransferWise stated:\n\nBitcoin, I think we can say, is dead. There is no traction, no one is using bitcoin. The bitcoin experiment, I think we can say, is over.\n\nThe notion of the “failed experiment” of the cryptocurrency is one that was – with significant mainstream coverage – shared by former Bitcoin core developer Mike Hearn.\n\nAs a well-funded company in the Fintech space focusing on remittance, it was clear that TransferWise would look into bitcoin and blockchain innovation. Indeed, Hinrikus stated, “We’ve certainly paid lots of attention to bitcoin and blockchain.”\n\nWhile TransferWise is solely used as a means to transfer different forms of fiat money, Hinrikus opined that he’s unaware of the problems that the cryptocurrency solves and summed it up as a gold rush.\n\nWhat really happened was a gold rush. People bought bitcoin because they thought it would be worth more tomorrow. And a lot of people got lucky. But we’re not seeing real people use bitcoin. And we don’t know what problem it solves.\n\nHe is of a different opinion of bitcoin’s underpinning technology, the blockchain.\n\nNow blockchain, I think, is a genius advancement in technology. But I’m nto sure we’re seeing yet where to apply it.\n\nAdding that he’s excited to see the inroads made into private blockchain technology by R3 and Digital Asset Holdings, Hinrikus continued, “I think there are many areas where using blockchain is great, but it’s still early days.”\n\nHinrikus’ TransferWise could arguably count bitcoin as a competitor in the international remittance space. TransferWise facilitates peer-to-peer individual money transfers with quicker timelines than banks and, notably, smaller transfer fees. These are properties inherent with the cryptocurrency if it were to be used as a means of transfer or settlement.\n\nWhilst it may be somewhat surprising for a Fintech-based executive invested in new technology have little faith in the biggest, most widely-used cryptocurrency of them all, his opinion is one shared by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. A noted bitcoin skeptic, Dimon has previously stated that the cryptocurrency will ultimately be a “waste of time”.\n\nDimon reiterated those views again at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year when he stated Bitcoin as a currency was “going nowhere.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Palo Alto Networks has discovered a unique malware family that can mine bitcoins via the victim’s CPUs and GPUs. The malware, called PWOBot, is completely written in Python and compiled via PyInstaller, generating a Microsoft Windows executable, according to a Palo Alto Networks posting. The malware has affected European organizations, mainly in Poland. A Polish file-sharing service delivers the malware.\n\nThe malware can download and execute files, log keystrokes, execute Python code and mine bitcoins via the affected computers’ GPUs and CPUs.\n\nThe malware has been noticed as far back as late 2013. There are at least two variants. Recent attacks have affected organizations from mid to late 2015.\n\nNumerous Victims Attacked\n\nThe malware has affected the following victims: a large Polish retailer, a Polish shipping company, a Polish national institution, a Polish information technology organization, a Danish building company, and a French optical equipment provider.\n\nChomikuj.pl, a Polish file sharing web service, downloaded most of the PWOBot samples. The following URLs have provided PWOBot copies.\n\ns6216.chomikuj[.]pl/File.aspx?e=Pdd9AAxFcKmWlkqPtbpUrzfDq5_SUJBOz\n\ns6102.chomikuj[.]pl/File.aspx?e=Hc4mp1AqJcyitgKbZvYM4th0XwQiVsQDW\n\ns8512.chomikuj[.]pl/File.aspx?e=h6v10uIP1Z1mX2szQLTMUIoAmU3RcW5tv\n\ns6429.chomikuj[.]pl/File.aspx?e=LyhX9kLrkmkrrRDIf6vq7Vs8vFNhqHONt\n\ns5983.chomikuj[.]pl/File.aspx?e=b5Xyy93_GHxrgApU8YJXJlOUXWxjXgW2w\n\ns6539.chomikuj[.]pl/File.aspx?e=EH9Rj5SLl8fFxGU-I0VZ3FdOGBKSSUQhl\n\ns6701.chomikuj[.]pl/File.aspx?e=tx0a8KUhx57K8u_LPZDAH18ib-ehvFlZl\n\ns6539.chomikuj[.]pl/File.aspx?e=EH9Rj5SLl8fFxGU-I0VZ3ISlGKLuMnr9H\n\ns6539.chomikuj[.]pl/File.aspx?e=EH9Rj5SLl8fFxGU-I0VZ3OFFAuDc0M9m0\n\ns6179.chomikuj[.]pl/File.aspx?e=Want-FTh0vz6www2xalnT1Nk6O_Wc6huR\n\ns6424.chomikuj[.]pl/File.aspx?e=o_4Gk0x3F9FWxSDo4JWYuvGXDCsbytZMY\n\nThe IP address http://108.61.167 downloaded one instance of the malware. The address is related to the tracking[.]com domain, which a number of PWOBot samples also used.\n\nThe following file names delivered the malware:\n\n• favicon.png\n\n• Quick PDF to Word 3.0.exe\n\n• XoristDecryptor 2.3.19.0 full ver.exe\n\n• Easy Barcode Creator 2.2.6.exe\n\n• Kingston Format Utility 1.0.3.0.exe\n\n• uCertify 1Z0-146 Oracle Database 8.05.05 Premium.exe\n\n• Six Sigma Toolbox 1.0.122.exe\n\n• Fizjologia sportu. Krtkie wykady.exe [Physiology of sports. Short lectures.exe]\n\nSamples Purport To Be Software\n\nSome the PWOBot samples present themselves as various software utility programs.\n\nHow the malware first infected its victims is unclear. The filenames allow some inferences since the malware could have gone to end users thinking they were downloading other software. It is also possible phishing attacks enticed victims to download the files.\n\nThe attackers use PyInstaller to convert the Python code into a Microsoft executable. But Python, as it is being used, can move to other operating systems like OSX and Linux.\n\nHow It Installs\n\nPWOBot, upon first execution, will first uninstall earlier PWOBot versions they find. The malware will query Run registry keys seeking previous versions. Most versions use a “pwo[VERSION]” format for the Run registry key, where [VERSION] is the PWOBot version number.\n\nAfter the prior versions uninstall, the malware installs itself to create a copy of its executable in this location:\n\n%HOMEPATH%/pwo[VERSION]\n\nThen it sets the following registry key to direct to the newly-copied executable:\n\nHKCU/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run/pwo[VERSION]\n\nShould this be the first run for the malware, PWOBot executes the newly copied file in a new process.\n\nFollowing installation, the malware hooks various keyboard and mouse events that are used for subsequent keylogging functions. PWOBot allows the attacker to include various modules during runtime since it is written in a modular fashion. The following services and their descriptions have come with PWOBot based on the samples currently identified:\n\n• PWOLauncher : Download/execute file, or execute local file\n\n• PWOHTTPD : Spawn a HTTP server on the victim machine\n\n• PWOKeyLogger : Log keystrokes on the victim machine\n\n• PWOMiner : Mine bitcoins using the victim CPU/GPU\n\n• PWOPyExec : Execute Python code\n\n• PWOQuery : Query remote URL and return results\n\nTwo Configuration Files\n\nPWOBot comes with two configuration files, including one that specifies different settings the malware should use, while the other specifies the remote servers the malware should connect to during execution.\n\nPOWBot includes various windows executables included when attackers compile the code with PyInstaller, as shown in the settings configuration (Figure 2). The executables perform bitcoin mining and to-proxy requests via Tor. The bitcoin miner is a compiled version of cgminer and minerd. The files are used for CPU and GPU bitcoin mining respectively.\n\nAlso read: Report: BitTorrent malware risks call for better security measures\n\nMalware Uses Tor\n\nPWOBot uses Tor to tunnel traffic to attackers’ remote servers. This offers both anonymity and encryption, but it should also alert network administrators who see it since the traffic most likely violates organization policies.\n\nPWOBot uses a Python dictionary for its network protocol. Every specified period PWOBot will notify the remote server.\n\nEnumerations are configured to represent the different numbers encountered in the prior example. A more complete picture of the data being sent becomes visible when replaced with their respective enumeration.\n\nOnce notices are sent, the attacker might choose to give a command instructing PWOBot to perform a previously defined service. The results of these actions then upload to the attacker using the same format.\n\n12 Malware Variants\n\nA total of 12 malware variants apparently exist, based on the last versions Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 identified. The unit has witnessed versions five, six, seven, nine 10 and 12 in the wild.\n\nChanges among versions seem minimal and are likely performance improvements.\n\nWhile PWOBot has affected Microsoft Windows platforms, it can move to the Linus and OSX operating systems as the underlying code is cross-platform. This fact, along with a modular design, makes PWOBot a significant potential threat.\n\nThe malware family has not previously been disclosed.\n\nPalo Alto Networks protects customers from this threat in the following ways:\n\n• All PWOBot samples are properly categorized as malicious by the WildFire service.\n\n• Domains related to the PWOBot threat have been appropriately categorized as malicious.\n\n• AutoFocus customers may use the PWOBot tag to monitor this threat.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

04/21/2016,"['A Florida man was arrested on Thursday for participating in a bribery scheme aimed at supporting an illegal bitcoin exchange operated by his son and owned by an Israeli behind a series of hacking attacks on organizations such as J.P. Morgan Chase (jpm).\n\nMichael Murgio, who serves on a school board in Palm Beach County, was charged in an indictment filed in federal court in Manhattan for participating in a scheme to pay bribes to let the bitcoin exchange’s operators gain control of a credit union.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Murgio, 65, in Palm Beach on Thursday morning, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. His lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe indictment added Murgio as a defendant in a case against three other individuals including his son Anthony Murgio, who prosecutors say operated the unlicensed bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx, and was involved in the bribe scheme.\n\nProsecutors have said that Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli accused of orchestrating a massive hacking scheme with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, and an American, Joshua Samuel Aaron.\n\nProsecutors contend Shalon, Orenstein, and Aaron ran a criminal enterprise that hacked into a dozen companies’ networks, stealing the personal information of more than 100 million people.\n\nIn the case of JPMorgan, prosecutors said records belonging to more than 83 million customers had been stolen.\n\nWhile the Murgios are not accused of engaging in the hacking offenses, prosecutors said they committed crimes with their co-defendants, Florida resident Yuri Lebedev and New Jersey pastor Trevon Gross, related to the unlicensed operation of Coin.mx.\n\nProsecutors said beginning in 2013, Anthony Murgio operated Coin.mx, which exchanged millions of dollars of the virtual currency bitcoin for customers, while Lebedev supervised computer programming functions for the exchange.\n\nTo evade scrutiny of Coin.mx, the Murgios and Lebedev in 2014 acquired control of Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, by paying $150,000 in bribes to Trevon Gross, a pastor who was its chairman, the indictment said.\n\nAnthony Murgio, Lebedev and Gross have previously pled not guilty to the charges against them. They are scheduled to face trial on Oct. 31.\n\nExtradition proceedings in Israel against Shalon and Orenstein remain pending. Aaron remains at large and was believed by the FBI, as of November when he was indicted, to be in Eastern Europe.', 'Valve is preparing to implement Bitcoin support on Steam, numerous reports today suggest. The digital currency is likely to be a payment option quite soon, too, if screenshots taken from Steam\'s private developer forums are accurate.\n\n""We are excited to announce that Steam is going to start accepting payments via bitcoin,"" reads the announcement (via PCGamesN). ""We’re using an external payment provider to process Bitcoin payments to help partners reach more customers on Steam.\n\n""Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly popular online payment method in some countries, and we’re enabling a system that insulates partners from risk and volatility while still providing value to the end customer.""\n\nSteam will charge the user based on the current value of Bitcoin in their region – so it\'s not an exciting new way for Australians, for example, to bypass common region-specific cost increases. For developers and publishers, no action is required: they\'ll continue to set their prices according to whichever currency they prefer, and Steam\'s external payment provider will operate the currency conversion automatically.\n\nMeanwhile, the external payment provider will also convert the Bitcoin back to local currency on Valve\'s end. ""At no time does Valve receive or hold Bitcoin,"" the announcement insists.\n\nInterestingly, the use of Bitcoin in Australia could lead to consumers side-stepping local GST costs, due to the government\'s view that Bitcoin is ""akin to a bartering arrangement"". According to Australia\'s tax website, ""there will be no income tax or GST implications if you are not in business or carrying on an enterprise and you simply pay for goods or services in Bitcoin."" While Australians don\'t pay GST on Steam purchases at the moment, they\'re likely to do so starting next year.\n\nIt could also throw a spanner in the works regarding regional consumer protection laws, which cost Valve a lot of money recently.', 'The digital currency Bitcoin is on the radar of India’s security and intelligence agencies with sex syndicates, arms and drugs traders and even terrorist groups preferring it to cash.\n\nThe Centre has asked authorities to keep a close watch on the maverick payment tool with near anonymity built into its system making it ideal for criminals.\n\nThe cryptocurrency allows illegal operations with the speed of the internet, but with the secrecy of a cash deal.\n\nThe home ministry has taken up the security issue with the finance ministry and RBI: in a secret communication it said the currency is being used for crimes, including drug trafficking, illegal arms trade and prostitution in India\n\nBitcoin, heralded as a new way to conduct a broad array of financial transactions, costs about Rs 29,000 apiece but the price fluctuates every day.\n\nThe home ministry has taken up the security issue with the finance ministry and RBI: in a secret communication it said the currency is being used for crimes, including drug trafficking, illegal arms trade and prostitution in India.\n\nAccording to experts, Bitcoin and the dark web - where sites are hidden from search engines like Google - form a deadly cocktail as it is very tough to trace a user carrying out transactions through specific software.\n\n“Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2008 but due to its features it is now majorly used in criminal activities,” said Pawan Duggal, who advises organisations on cyber laws.\n\n“It became more dangerous when users started using it through the darknet, which can only be accessed by specialised software.”\n\nWhile every Bitcoin transaction is public, the parties involved are kept anonymous as addresses can be created without providing any personal information.\n\nThe virtual currency has also been used before in ransomware - a type of malware that restricts computer access unless a ransom is paid.\n\nClose watch\n\n“We need a close watch on the use of the Bitcoin currency in financial transactions because Bitcoin as the currency of the underground internet is also being used in drug trafficking, illegal arms trade and prostitution. There is a need to have effective regulations regarding the use of Bitcoin. The MHA will take up the matter with ministry of finance and Reserve Bank of India,” said a government note sent to various intelligence units that was accessed by Mail Today.\n\nThe virtual currency has also been used before in ransomware - a type of malware that restricts computer access unless a ransom is paid\n\nAccording to a senior Delhi Police officer in the economic offences wing, Bitcoin is fast becoming the preferred choice in illegal transactions.\n\n“Bitcoin currency transactions need monitoring as this method of sending money to any part of the world is being used by criminal syndicates, including organised prostitution, involving fat deals,” he said.\n\n“It has been noticed that people involved in prostitution are sending money from abroad through Bitcoin to various parts of Mumbai, Delhi, etc.”\n\nThough in India companies seek PAN card details for such transactions, the process is not fool-proof, say experts.\n\nOne way of bypassing the check is to download a particular software and use it through a hidden network that cannot be traced.\n\nBengaluru Police recently found a trail of Bitcoins used to buy drugs from a dark site.\n\nInvestigators said three students purchased banned Ecstasy pills from a website, which were delivered by courier.', 'Kraken, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges in the world has announced the appointment of Edward Stadum, a lawyer and fintech advisor with over five decades of legal experience and insight into international law.\n\nGlobal Bitcoin exchange Kraken has hired Edward M. Stadum as its General Counsel. Stadum will provide opinion and specialist advice for the crypto-exchange’s expansion plans globally, with a focus on best business practices, corporate governance, finance, strategy, acquisitions, and finance.\n\nStadum leaves his post as US General Counsel to Fidor Bank, an innovative online direct bank in Germany that facilitates Kraken’s euro business. Stadum found potential in the digital currency market after being tasked to do a comprehensive external audit of Kraken.\n\nIn statements revealed by Finance Magnates, Stadum stated:\n\nAfter combing through every detail (with the audit), I grew more and more interested in the remarkable opportunities ahead for Kraken and for the digital currency market, so much that with Fidor’s consent, I left the bank to join the client full time.\n\nA former Air Force veteran, Stadum is also a graduate of Stanford and holds a joint degree from Harvard Law. His credentials along with his experience make him a necessary resource for a bitcoin exchange looking to diversify and expand globally.\n\nKraken CEO Jesse Powell stated:\n\nEdward Stadum’s 50 years’ worth of experience in banking, technology, law and venture capital will serve Kraken in key markets in North America, Europe and around the globe.\n\nTo this end, Stadum saw potential in a growing industry, while Kraken benefits from his expertise.\n\nKraken is already at the center of this growing industry and I look forward to helping Jesse and the team elevate a thriving startup into a lasting, professional trusted financial enterprise globally.\n\nIn what is an extensive legal career, Stadum has previously practiced law in the conventional banking industry before starting TecVenture Partners, an early stage tech venture capital fund based in Munich, Germany.\n\nThe appointment bears significance with the storied legal expert with over five decades of experience in various financial sectors sought to join a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n“It says a lot that Ed wanted to join the team after seeing what was ‘under the hood’ while conducting an audit of Kraken,” Powell stated, before adding, “In fact, having a window into how things work at Kraken made him even more interested in joining our exchange, which is a good sign that we have a solid foundation and that we’re on the right track for long-term success.”\n\nThe news comes during a time when Kraken is making inroads into pushing Bitcoin trading and settlement services in Japan. An alliance with new Japanese investor Money Partners Group, one of the leading brokerages in Japan with some 270,000 client networks will see each one now enabled to engage in bitcoin trading and settlement services with blockchain-based derivative trading.\n\nThe forex broker took part in Kraken’s successful Series B round of financing that was revealed last week. The same round also saw SBI Investment, Japan’s leading venture capital firm, invest in Kraken in a “multi-million dollar agreement” that was secured by the bitcoin exchange in February 2016.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'About The Author\n\nEduardo Gómez is a Computer Science Major from Venezuela, a country with a loyal Bitcoin user base. He discovered Bitcoin in 2012 and now he use it to escape the triple-digit inflation that Venezuela suffers, he is focusing on developing a writing career, and he tries to keep up with the news in FinTech and Blockchain Technologies.', 'Just a few months after the platform\'s production launch, the first Ethereum startups are already receiving interest, and in some cases, undisclosed investments, from digital currency-focused VC firms.\n\nInterviews with four of the leading blockchain and digital currency industry investors revealed that many are already performing due diligence on startups utilizing the decentralized application platform. Announced in 2014, Ethereum has gained significant traction of late following a successful hard fork and testing from major financial institutions.\n\nTravis Scher, investment associate at Digital Currency Group (DCG), for instance, said the New York-based firm has so far evaluated 20 to 30 startups working on Ethereum, while Blockchain Capital managing partner Bart Stephens told CoinDesk that the firm has already made two as-yet-undisclosed investments in such startups.\n\nStephens said that Blockchain Capital, one of the technology\'s most active early-stage investors, is ""bullish"" on Ethereum due to the positive feedback its technology has received from institutions.\n\nThe firm has even appointed a junior associate, Jeremy Gardner, to focus on the area for its portfolio, which already includes bitcoin-based startups such as Coinbase and Xapo.\n\nStephens told CoinDesk:\n\n""We love bitcoin, we love the bitcoin blockchain, but we also see a multi-chain future. Some of the enterprise customers are interested in federated and private chains and Ethereum is pretty high on the list.""\n\nWhen announced, such an investment would mark an early sign of confidence for Ethereum, which only recently launched with a limited set of features. In the months and years ahead, the platform plans a number of complex updates, including a switch from proof-of-work transaction verification to a proof-of-stake approach.\n\nOther bitcoin and blockchain-focused venture firms including DCG, Boost VC and Pantera Capital indicated they are interested in investing in Ethereum startups, but have not yet provided funding to any entrepreneurs.\n\nDCG said it expects to make its first investment in a digital currency company in Q2 or Q3 of 2016, and that ""a few"" Ethereum startups would likely join its portfolio by the year’s end.\n\nBy contrast, the first investment in a company working on the bitcoin protocol wasn’t made until April 2012, more than three years after its first block was mined in January 2009. At the time, Draper Associates made a seed investment in the now-defunct bitcoin-focused incubator CoinLab.\n\nInvestment challenges\n\nAs for why investors aren’t yet placing any public bets, most respondents suggested they felt it was too early to tell how strong Ethereum\'s developer ecosystem will remain.\n\nSuch statements coincide with long-standing statements from industry investors that the health of bitcoin’s developer ecosystem is one of its most attractive attributes.\n\n""One of the challenges in evaluating Ethereum startups is the community is still fairly small and some of the entrepreneurs are newer to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, making it difficult to navigate,"" Meltem Demirors, director of community at DCG, told CoinDesk.\n\nDemirors went on to describe the early bitcoin ecosystem as perhaps more connected and more technical than the Ethereum ecosystem of today.\n\nOthers, like Brayton Williams, co-founder of Silicon Valley-based incubator Boost VC, indicated that there is perhaps a lack of mature entrepreneurs building on the technology.\n\n""For us we need to first find great people who are out to solve a problem and that are confident Ethereum could be the solution or provide tools for the solution,"" he told CoinDesk. ""We do our best to avoid those who are just very excited about Ethereum technology and then go try to find a problem.""\n\nPaul Veradittakit, venture investor at Pantera Capital, noted that his firm is often pegged as a bitcoin-only investor, but that it has been eager to take a multi-blockchain approach, something he suggested Ethereum now allows. Yet, he said the firm has questions about how the technology will overcome upcoming challenges.\n\n""You want to make sure that the security is well thought out, that the scalability is thought out and that you identify the use cases,"" Veradittakit said, adding: ""We\'ve been monitoring it.""\n\nVeradittakit said Pantera has no plans as of now to offer an ether fund to complement its bitcoin fund, introduced in 2014.\n\nBitcoin startup interest\n\nA driver factor behind the interest, respondents said, is that digital currency industry firms are paying attention to, and implementing, Ethereum as part of their market approach.\n\nStephens noted that a number of Blockchain Capital’s portfolio firms, including Bitfinex, Kraken and BitGo, are now offering Ethereum services, and that GoCoin, a payment processing firm, would soon add support.\n\n""We’re seeing a lot of companies add Ethereum. Instead of selling chocolate, now they have chocolate and vanilla,"" he said.\n\nDemirors said that some DCG portfolio companies are taking a similar path, building infrastructure for the ecosystem’s service providers.\n\n""I think many of the early movers we’ll see in this ecosystem are existing bitcoin companies that can leverage their operational capabilities and strategic relationships with banks, regulators and other stakeholders to begin building a robust, global network for exchanging, holding, storing and managing ether,"" she said.\n\nNotably, such a logic has been historically used by the financial industry to suggest why it might be more able to help blockchain-based technologies reach the mass market.\n\nGrowth potential\n\nAs for the growth potential for Ethereum startups, respondents were mixed on projections.\n\nDCG’s Scher said that a cornerstone of its investment thesis is that bitcoin is both a secure store of value and a financial rail, and that Ethereum is unlikely to compete against the bitcoin in these areas.\n\nHowever, Scher sees Ethereum potentially competing against bitcoin in serving as a platform for smart contracts, identity management and provenance, other potentially large and impactful areas for the technology.\n\n""Startups building these types of products and services may opt to use Ethereum in the future because of its ease of use and other features that it possesses, and that’s a terrific development for us and the blockchain ecosystem,"" he said.\n\nDemirors said she believes the Ethereum community could one day surpass bitcoin in terms of the number of developers it attracts due to an easier scripting language, but said that it’s not out of the question innovators won’t find solutions to these issues.\n\nOverall, Stephens noted that he sees interest in Ethereum as positive, but that VC firms are just now beginning to analyze the industry for potential investments.\n\n""It\'s still early. We’ve met with over a dozen companies, and only a few of them in our opinion are investable,"" Stephens said, concluding:\n\n""I think that will change.""\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.\n\nHomestead image via Ethereum\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It informed him that all the files on the firm’s digital network had been encrypted and were being held ransom. If he ever wanted to access them again, he had to pay $500, in the Internet currency Bitcoin, within five days. If he didn’t, the note concluded, everything would be destroyed.\n\n“It wasn’t just a day’s worth of work,” Barnes told TIME. “It was the entire library of documents, all the Word documents, all the Excel.”\n\nUncertain of what to do next, Barnes called the police and then the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Everyone he spoke to told him the same thing: there was nothing they could do.\n\nIf he paid the $500, there was no guarantee he’d get the files back, they said. But if he didn’t pay, there was no way to save the firm’s data and, because many of these sorts of cybercriminals live abroad, there’s no way for the police or the FBI to prosecute the attackers. “They said, basically, ‘Look, we can’t help you,’” Barnes said. Two days later, the firm paid up.\n\nAnd that, cybersecurity experts say, is why so-called “ransomware” attacks have become so ubiquitous in the last two years: they’re relatively low-budget, low stakes, and don’t require much skill to pull off. Instead of going after high-value, heavily fortified systems, like banks or corporations, that require complex technological skills to hack, cybercriminals use ransomware to go straight for easy targets: small businesses, schools, hospitals, and Joe Blow computer users like us, who are likely to pay a few hundred—or a few thousand—bucks to get our digital lives back.\n\n“It’s a one-to-one relationship with the victim, and it’s anonymous,” said Juan Guerrero, a senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, a cybersecurity company that fielded 750,000 attacks last year, just among its own clients.\n\nWhile each type of ransomware virus is different, some, like CryptoLocker, boasted a 41% “success rate”—meaning that more than a third of victims ended up paying the ransom, according to a survey in the United Kingdom by the University of Kent. That virus earned between $3 million and $27 million for its criminal overlords, according to various estimates.\n\nWhile there’s no central clearinghouse that keeps of every ransomware attack, cybersecurity experts estimate that there are several million attacks on American computers a year. The average victim shells out about $300, according to a study by the global cybersecurity firm Symantec. But that adds up overtime.\n\nIn 2014, for example, one version of ransomware, CryptoWall, infected more than 625,000 computers worldwide, including a quarter million in the U.S., according to Dell Inc., and earning hackers roughly $1 million in just six months.\n\nBetween April 2014 and June 2015, the Internet Crime Complaint Center, a partnership between the nonprofit National White Collar Crime Center and the FBI, received 992 complaints about another version of ransomware, Cryptowall, in which victims reported losses of more than $18 million. Some cybersecurity experts estimate that hackers are earning north of $70,000 a month on ransomware.\n\nWith that much money flowing in, ransomware is on the rise. “These sorts of attacks are absolutely increasing,” Guerrero said.\n\nAccording to Symantec, there was a 250% increase in new ransomware available on the black market between 2013 and 2014, and by 2015, the underground ransomware industry had begun to mimic the way modern software is developed: there are criminal engineers and manufacturers, retailers, and “consumers”—hackers on the lookout for the newest, most effective product.\n\nSome criminals, who are usually based in Russia, Ukraine, Eastern Europe and China, have begun licensing what’s known as “exploit kits”—all-inclusive ransomware apps—to individual hackers for a couple hundred dollars a week.\n\nAs with most computer viruses, victims are often first targeted with a fraudulent email. If hackers can get victims to open an email and then download an attachment, then they can infiltrate their computer—and any computer associated with that computer’s network. Roughly 23% of people open phishing messages, according to a 2015 data-breach report from Verizon Enterprise Solutions. More than 10% then click on the attachments.\n\nVictims can also have their computers infected merely by visiting a compromised website—no download required—or joining an infected network. Sites that are the most likely to get people in trouble are those peddling pirated movies, TV and sports games, pornography, or networks like Tor that facilitate sharing of huge numbers of user files. PC users are generally more vulnerable to ransomware than Mac users in part because there are more PCs in the world. From a criminal’s perspective, malware designed to exploit a PC offers access to more potential victims.\n\nRansomware viruses have gotten more sophisticated in recent years, experts say. For example, some versions of ransomware are now designed to seek out the files on a victim’s computer that are most likely to be precious, such as a large number of old photographs, for example, tax filings, or financial worksheets. Other versions use social engineering tricks to make a victim feel guilt or shame—and therefore more likely to pay the ransom. Some appear to be official notices from the FBI or a cyber law enforcement agency claiming to know that a victim recently watched illegal porn, bought drug paraphernalia, or downloaded a pirated movie. In some particularly alarming cases, ransom notes come in over a computer’s speakers: the booming voice of a stranger demanding a Bitcoin payment echoes through the victim’s living room.\n\nIn the past year, ransomware attacks have shut down at least three health care centers, including one hospital in Los Angeles that paid $17,000 to regain access to its patients’ records. In March, MedStar Health, the massive, $5 billion health care juggernaut that operates 10 hospitals in the Washington, DC region, saw its computer system knocked offline for days in what some employees characterized as a ransomware attack.\n\nPolice departments, school districts, and small businesses, like Barnes’ law firm have also been recent targets, in part because they have less sophisticated security systems. According to Intel Security, 80% of small and medium-sized businesses don’t use data protection and fewer than half secure their email.\n\nThe only way to protect against a ransomware attack is rote: keep your operating system up to date, renew your anti-virus software regularly, back up your files on a daily or weekly basis, and never download anything from an email address you don’t recognize. Many cybersecurity experts warn that people should be particularly skeptical of emails with attachments that appear to be from trusted brands, like FedEx or Amtrak, when they arrive unexpectedly.\n\nOnce a computer has been infected with ransomware, there’s often very little that a consumer can do, said Robert Siciliano, the CEO of ID Theft Security.com. With some, limited variations of ransomware, law enforcement have the tools to reverse and remove the virus. But in most cases, victims are stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nIf a victim pays a ransom and the files are not restored, there’s no way to demand a refund. Most ransomware schemes require Bitcoin payments to be routed through file-sharing technologies, so law enforcement officials can’t usually identify where the money went. Like many in the cybersecurity world, Siciliano advises not paying the ransom in the first place. That money, he says, ends up funding newer, more innovative variations of the virus.\n\nBarnes says he doesn’t feel great about having paid the $500 ransom for his law firm’s files, but given the situation, he and his colleagues didn’t have much of a choice. “Everything is backed up now,” he said. “It’s not happening again.”', 'Matt Luongo, the founder of Fold, and his team are known for helping their app participants spend bitcoins at large retailers such as Starbucks, Target and Whole Foods, and today they have returned to their roots by re-launching another product they created for the space, to help people make bitcoins.\n\nThe product is called Card For Coin and in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine , Luongo explains that it is a re-release of their first release, originally launched in 2014 .\n\nSince 2014, the team spent more time focusing on developing the consumer side of their other business, which they called Coin for Coffee, until it was rebranded to Fold when the scope of the app broadened to niches other than coffee. Now, Luongo tells Bitcoin Magazine that the team is ""excited to revamp their founding product.""\n\n\n\nThe goal of Card For Coin is to allow participants to sell gift cards for Bitcoin. For the launch, Card For Coin allows users to exchange gift cards at Starbucks, Target and Walmart, but Luongo hinted to Bitcoin Magazine that they have some big partnerships set in the coming months on this side of their business.\n\n""Imagine any time you get a gift card you don\'t want, you can immediately convert it to Bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nThe user interface allows you to enter the details of your gift cards on the website, including the serial number and pin, which Luongo explains can be done with either a physical or online card, as well as a wallet address to receive the bitcoins. Participants receive an offer from the Card For Coin team for the card in Bitcoin shortly after, usually between 60 percent to 80 percent, depending on the retailer the gift card is for. The sales process is handled by the team in the background.\n\nFor a small amount on a gift card, no personal information is required from participants. When card amounts exceed a certain limit, some information is required for regulatory reasons to verify the account.\n\nLuongo tells Bitcoin Magazine that he is particularly excited about how this business creates the opportunity for people to quickly launch a small business without much startup capital, as well as to help people get their first bitcoins. He said in a statement that, ""some of our best customers have been enterprising teenagers who buy gift cards from their friends, as well as small business owners who run kiosks and pawn shops, and wanted to get into Bitcoin.""', 'In a signing ceremony at the Georgian Ministry of Justice. Bitcoin mining company BitFury, the Republic of Georgia’s National Agency of Public Registry and renowned Peruvian economist Hernando DeSoto announced Friday a partnership to design and pilot a blockchain land titling project.\n\nThe experiment revives blockchain enthusiasts’ dreams of using the technology — a transparent and secure ledger — for managing land titles. While in the United States and Western Europe, it’s common to have legal title to property such as homes, cars, etc., in many parts of the world, people do not have legal title to their assets. De Soto, president of Lima-based think tank, the Institute for Liberty and Democracy, estimates that the value of this “dead capital” totals $20 trillion.\n\nIt also signals a shift in direction for the San Francisco-based company that has, until now, been known primarily for mining.\n\n“We are launching the property rights registration project for Georgian citizens so that they can register property on the blockchain,” said Valery Vavilov, chief executive of BitFury.\n\n“Why the blockchain? It will help do three major things,” he said. “First, it will add security to the data so the data cannot be corrupted. Second, by powering the registry with the blockchain, the public auditor will also make a real-time audit. So the auditor will audit the registry not once per year, but every 10 minutes [for example]. Third, it will reduce the friction in registration and the cost of property rights registration, because people could do this in the future using their smart phones. Blockchain will be used as a notary service.”\n\nPapuna Ugrekhelidze, the Chairman of the National Agency of Public Registry of Georgia, said in a statement, “By building a blockchain-based property registry and taking full advantage of the security provided by the Blockchain technology, the Republic of Georgia can show the world that we are a modern, transparent and corruption-free country that can lead the world in changing the way land titling is done and pave the way to additional prosperity for all.”\n\n“Of the 7.3 billion people in the world, only two billion have a title that is legal and effective and public regarding their control over an asset,” De Soto, who is well-known for his work on how unofficial ownership of land and other property harms the prospects of much of the world’s poor, said. “When something is not legally on record as being owned, it can therefore not be used … as collateral to get credit, as a credential that you can be able to transfer part of your property to invite investment in. Things are owned, but when they’re not adequately paperized or recorded, they cannot fill the functions of creating capital and credit.”\n\nIt also creates problems for business. “If you’re going to be a mining company or an oil company or you are Hershey’s or Heinz 57 or Nestle, and you want to buy million acres in Ghana, your number one problem today is who you buy it from,” said De Soto.\n\nCurrently, buying or selling land in Georgia is a one-day process requiring the buyer or seller to go to a public registry house and pay between $50 and $200, depending on how quickly they want the transaction to be notarized. The pilot project will move elements of this process onto the blockchain and cost buyers and sellers in the range of $.05-$.10. “The outcome would be citizens of a specific region have a smartphone application and they’ll be able to move their assets, and that movement will be corresponded to tokens moving on the blockchain and doing it with even less friction than what the country has now,” says George Kikvadze, vice-chairman of BitFury’s board.\n\nThe agreement marks BitFury’s first project outside of the hardware and mining that have made the company’s reputation since its founding in 2010. Vavilov said that, on top of the mining or transaction processing infrastructure the company provides, it will now offer a software platform consisting of different frameworks for applications in voting; data analytics, such as for compliance and law enforcement; blockchain as a service for digitizing assets such as tickets, coupons and cars; and an API that will allow developers to create new applications for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n“[BitFury] is a one-stop shop for any business, any government and any individual to connect to the blockchain,” he said.\n\nMany blockchain adherents have long envisioned applying the technology to opaque, bureaucratic processes such as property rights registration to make them more transparent, secure and fast. However, a project previously announced by Factom that aimed to manage land titles in Honduras on the blockchain temporarily stalled. A May 2015 article stated an intention to have a pilot completed by December, but that month, Factom CEO Peter Kirby wrote in a blog post, “The project is political in nature, and government systems move slower than we all would like.” Additionally, the Honduran government never publicly stated any intention to either pursue or not pursue the project. However, Kirby now says, “That project is back on. The government was not stalling. It was just distracted because they are a government.”\n\nWhile, arguably, the problem of land titling is greater in Honduras than in Georgia — the initial news report about the Factom deal quoted Kirby as saying, ""In the past, Honduras has struggled with land title fraud. The country\'s database was basically hacked. So bureaucrats could get in there and they could get themselves beachfront properties"" — BitFury believes that Georgia’s more well-functioning system and reform mindset make it the perfect place to showcase the virtues of registering land titles on a blockchain.\n\nGeorgia, which Vavilov called “progressive” and “innovative,” has made a name for fighting corruption in the last few years. While it ranked near last (123) on Transparency International\'s Corruption Perception Index in 2003, it now ranks 48th.\n\nVavilov says its well-organized data and relatively corruption-free land titling process will make it easier to organize and secure the data and run the pilot, without worrying about political considerations holding up the process. According to the World Bank, Georgia ranks third in the world for ease of registering a property for a small or medium-sized business. Honduras, in contrast, ranks 88th.\n\n“The government is really committed to reform,” says Kikvadze. “It takes two to tango. The initial reaction was very positive and supportive, and not just from the level of the Prime Minister but also the level of technical team. Because they had completed a major reform in terms of updating the public registry a couple years ago, they have a hunger for ‘What’s next?’ So it’s always good to work in an environment where you’re not treated with suspicion, but as if someone is learning from you and vice versa. In this cooperative environment, I think you can accomplish much more than in a place we had to be fighting corrupt officials and people with different agendas.”\n\nThe project has personal meaning for Vavilov. “I was born and grew up in Latvia, which was part of the Soviet Union, but is now part of the EU. When the Soviet Union collapsed, my parents lost everything because the money literally became paper,” he said. “This technology can really save people’s assets, which is especially for property rights registration in emerging markets.”\n\nWhile the system is yet to be fully designed, the company intends to create a private blockchain tailored for property rights registration that is anchored to the public Bitcoin blockchain. This means that the land titles will be managed on a closed system so no one individual transaction will be identifiable and public, but that the public can have confidence that the record will not be tampered with because the data on it will collectively be stamped onto the public Bitcoin blockchain, making any fraudulent changes to the private blockchain visible to the whole world.\n\nDespite being in its infancy, the project has already piqued the interest of other governments, and representatives of two Peruvian presidential candidates will be attending the signing in Georgia to learn more about BitFury’s solution.\n\nThe company expects to launch the project by year end, and the eventual goal would be, if it proves successful, to build it out and eventually apply it in countries with even less functional land titling systems.\n\nFriday April 22, 2016. 3:30pm EST: This post has been updated to correct the location of the signing ceremony to the Georgian Ministry of Justice and to include a photo of the event.', 'How bitcoin\'s sister technology could change the future of healthcare\n\nThe larger world didn\'t start paying much attention to bitcoin until 2013. That was the year mainstream companies like Microsoft, Expedia and Dell, among others, began to accept the alternative, electronic payment method. That was also the year the Department of Homeland Security shut down the Silk Road, a ""dark web"" hub for illegal activity, and began to investigate the Tokyo-based digital exchange Mt. Gox, seizing millions of dollars in bitcoin in the process.\n\nBitcoin an electronic currency that exists but can\'t be touched, that operates above banks with no central authority and is issued by collective action. It promises extensive control over capital for businesses and individuals and enables efficient transfer worldwide with no limitations or surcharges.\n\nThe currency\'s site puts it simply — ""bitcoins are digital coins you can send through the internet."" Bitcoin supporters and detractors alike have touted the system as having the potential to upend economics as we know it. As might be expected, bitcoin has faced pushback at nearly every turn.\n\nHowever, now that more eyes are trained on bitcoin, some argue the real magic behind the coin is being overlooked: a code, called blockchain, which acts as the unbreakable security backbone of all bitcoin transactions.\n\n""It helps to think about a blockchain kind of like a global computer,"" says Micah Winkelspecht, founder and CEO of Gem, a blockchain technology company. ""It\'s a giant machine that allows us to interoperate with each other and to do that in a very trusted way. Economists call it the global trust machine — a giant network of connected computers all operating together to come to a consensus on what is true.""\n\nMr. Winkelspecht founded Venice, Calif.-based Gem after working to build a community of bitcoin users in Los Angeles around the same time the term ""bitcoin"" became more familiar. He began writing an open source library to help build security tools for the currency and, by his own admission, went down the rabbit hole and never came back.\n\nGem began as a way to offer those open source tools to other developers, so they wouldn\'t have to start from scratch when designing applications for bitcoin. Then Mr. Winkelspecht began to notice a lot of interest from large financial institutions who were hyped on the fervor with which smaller, younger companies were moving toward bitcoin and its related technologies. After a time it became apparent that healthcare, in its relentless search for better interoperability and cybersecurity, stood to benefit from blockchain.\n\nEvery time a patient sees their physician, they create a wake of digital activity, Mr. Winkelspecht says. That wake ripples through the care continuum, from the pharmacist who fills a prescription to the pharmaceutical firms from which they order drugs.\n\n""What the blockchain allows us to do is create a new type of fabric for the underlying infrastructure of the entire healthcare industry,"" Mr. Winkelspecht said. ""It would allow all parties — from insurers to providers — to connect in real-time and share information essentially instantly, without having to pass paper or even data back and forth.""\n\nTwo of the primary components that make up a blockchain are identity and historical record, which Mr. Winkelspecht compares to a giant log of events, each of which is attributed to a proof in the real world. The log is unchangeable, so it provides a secure record of exactly who did what, where and when. This ""integrity layer"" provides a guarantee that no data contained in a blockchain has been modified or changed. These guarantees are strong enough that the blockchain enables users to track activity across an industry, or across countries. This is one of the reasons the financial sector, which is global in nature, was the first to become enamored by the technology and first to adopt it.\n\n""It allows you to move data from point A to point B anywhere in the world with strong guarantees around the integrity and confidentiality of that data, so only the right person at the right time has access to it,"" Mr. Winkelspecht says.\n\nIn March 2016, Estonia\'s e-Health Authority partnered with Guardtime, a blockchain company, to help secure and facilitate interoperability for its nationwide EHR system.\n\nMr. Winkelspecht sees the most promising places for blockchain to be used in healthcare at the connecting points between stakeholders, like insurers and providers. The blockchain would allow the appropriate parties to view, edit and find the data in the exact same place, without the middlemen, routers and third companies that handle not only the data but the network connections parties use to pass sensitive information back and forth.\n\nBlockchain is often viewed as a financial technology, which may be why its place in healthcare has been slow-moving. But the pattern that the financial sector established with bitcoin and blockchain will probably play out the same way for hospitals and health systems, according to Mr. Winkelspecht.\n\n""It took about a year and a half for the financial industry to go from looking at bitcoin and saying, \'This will never work,\' to where it is now, where essentially every major financial institution in the world is either exploring blockchain or has active teams devoted to building projects using it,"" Mr. Winkelspecht says.\n\nCurrently, Mr. Winkelspecht says he doesn\'t know of any healthcare organizations in the U.S. actively using the technology. Part of the reason may be related to cost — for many, upgrading to blockchain could require gutting antiquated systems. But once the perception around blockchain dissipates and healthcare stakeholders begin to understand not only how the technology works, but its implications, it could take off much in the same way it did in finance.\n\n""This year already we\'re seeing major healthcare organizations beginning to explore it and we\'re working to help them start building prototypes and pilot programs,"" Mr. Winkelspecht says. ""It\'s on a very short time horizon.""\n\nMore articles on health IT:\n\nWhat the US can learn from Estonia\'s electronic health records\n\nThe future of the hospital is the network\n\nUS government at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to cybersecurity: 7 insights\n\n© Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2017.

04/22/2016,"['An unconfirmed announcement circulating on Reddit has disclosed Steam’s plans to integrate Bitcoin payments into its gaming platform.\n\nAccording to a snapshot allegedly taken from the publicly unavailable Steamworks Development forum, the gaming distribution platform is close to forming a partnership with an “external payment provider” to add Bitcoin support. The announcement reads:\n\n“Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly popular online payment method in some countries, and we are enabling a system that insulates partners from risk and volatility while still providing value to end customer.”\n\nIt is not the first time when Steam and bitcoin are mentioned in the same headline. Earlier this year, a screenshot taken from Steam beta client code had also claimed a possible integration between them and a Bitcoin payment processing company BitPay. There was, however, no confirmation from Valve Corporation — the parent company of Steam — regarding such an advancement.\n\nThe latest rumor, however, strengthens the possibilities. Bitcoin is slowly making its presence felt among the online gaming circles for its ability to provide a cheaper transaction alternative. Also, the digital currency ensures to protect merchants and customers from online frauds that are pretty common in credit card industry.\n\nThere are already a number of renowned online gaming stores that support Bitcoin payments on their platforms, including Gamesplanet, Kinguin, and Greenmangaming. There are also few cryptocurrencies like Hyper and BigUp that are being extensively used on game servers running Valve Corporations’ most popular flagship game Counter Strike.\n\nInitially launched in 2000, Counter Strike was among the first FPS (first person shooter) multiplayer games to gain a large fan following. Since then, community members constantly contribute various mods to enhance the gameplay by including new levels and game elements, to keep everything up to date with the gamers’ evolving tastes and preferences.\n\nCounter-Strike game server hosts accept various modes of payments including bitcoin, hyper, bigup and other altcoins along with fiat transactions from the gamers. Given the amount of traction received by Valve’s offering, it is not surprising for the company to replicate the same model in its other offerings, including Steam. Steam is a global platform with people from across the world buying games and downloadable patches and content for their games. Allowing bitcoin payments on Steam will create a universal payment option that can be used by gamers, irrespective of their geographic location.\n\nAlso, bitcoin has already been equated to in-game currency during its initial days of existence. The digital currency has outgrown this reference, for it has grown to become a global currency that can be used to pay for literally anything under the sun.\n\nAs the saying goes, there can be no smoke without a fire, and there have been plenty of rumors about the integration of bitcoin into Steam. So, there is plenty of hope that it may turn out to be true in the coming days.', 'Contactless payments, Octopus, WeChat, Apple Pay … the digital world is turning quickly to electronic money, with cheques and now cash on the endangered list.\n\nWith global travel and trade and a demand for ever greater transparency, currency exchange fees are being questioned, and even the need for national currencies. The old system is fast looking like, well, old money. So why not have a completely digital currency?\n\nEnter bitcoin, which appeared as an alternative method of exchange after the global financial crisis of 2009. Created by a mysterious computer coder with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, it’s since been the flag-bearer for digital money.\n\nThis peer-to-peer electronic cash system gets its fair share of detractors, and it’s become obvious that it’s not going to dominate tomorrow’s world. However, the technology at its core almost certainly will.\n\nCalled the blockchain and used throughout Bitcoin exchanges, this is about securely tracking and verifying transactions of any kind.\n\nAble to distribute data (for that’s all digital currency really is) that can’t be tampered with, some think it could help create a 100 per cent secure internet.\n\n“The blockchain technology is not the same as Bitcoin and provides benefits beyond virtual currencies,” says Andrew Erickson, executive vice-president of State Street Corporation and head of global services business in Asia Pacific.\n\nHe describes it as a “foundational technology” and one that can be used across hundreds of industries. “Blockchain’s ability to have multiple parties store distributed copies of the same data, while guaranteeing consensus, or the same version of truth, is a new paradigm in the institutional world,” he says.\n\nAdd built-in cryptography that means data can’t be intercepted or changed – at least, not without leaving a permanent record – and we could have reliability that the digital world has never before enjoyed.\n\nUsing the blockchain would also help digitise a banking system that’s so far been reluctant to abandon the old ways.\n\n“Today, many activities in a trade transaction are manual and paper-reliant,” says Vivek Ramachandran, global head of product and proposition management at HSBC.\n\n“Blockchains offer the promise of automating transactions and replacing document checking with data checking.”\n\nAbandoning fax machines and form-filling for an autonomous digital system that tracks and traces every transaction will reduce costs for banks, but it could also drastically change what banks do.\n\n“In trade finance, a distributed ledger blockchain could potentially allow for buyers and sellers to agree on the terms of a deal, and use a blockchain ledger to track and manage the transaction from start to finish,” says Ramachandran.\n\nSo who needs banks?\n\n“Some see blockchain as removing banks from financial transactions, while others, less dramatically, predict that it will bring a more efficient technology to support current practices,” says Mark Nuttall, at Linklaters. “Everyone must wait and see.”\n\nBanking group Santander estimates that blockchains could save banks US$20 billion a year by 2022.\n\nWhether it kills the banks or saves them money, what does all of this mean for us?\n\nCross-border payments should get cheaper, certainly, while transactions of all kinds should get quicker; selling a house, having a loan deposited in your bank account, and making any kind of payment.\n\nBlockchain could also be used to digitally lock medical records; doctors would need express permission to access them, and their viewing of them would be indelibly recorded. Ditto credit histories and educational records.\n\nThe technology could also help usher in a new era of micro-payments that could turn on its head our understanding of value.\n\nWith everything digitised and streamlined, tiny reconciliation charges would be possible; a Wi-fi hot spot could charge you by the second, or a shopping mall could charge you just for coming inside if it’s raining outside.\n\nYou could be refunded a small, but precise amount on your Octopus card if there was a delay in your MTR journey, or charged extra if you take a seat.\n\nThere are a lot of links to make for those kind of scenarios to happen, but the key technology is blockchain, which is the current king of emerging tech.\n\nChinese conglomerate and car-parts manufacturer Wanxiang Group is investing US$50 million to create Blockchain Labs, a venture capital fund that will back start-ups experimenting with blockchain technology. IBM, Intel, Microsoft and others are all exploring how the technology could and should change the digital sphere, while hundreds of start-ups are experimenting.\n\nAirbnb is even trying to use the blockchain to make its user profiles into universal, readable digital identities. Once merely a bitcoin technology, blockchain is turning into a gold rush.\n\nBitcoin is not popular with the People’s Bank of China, where the recent devaluation of the yuan and tighter currency controls seem to be encouraging the use of bitcoin as a way of transferring money out of the country.\n\n“There are mounting concerns that this is becoming an increasingly large source of flight of capital,” says Genevieve Leveille chief executive of KrypC, a blockchain start-up which is headquartered in India and works across Asia.\n\nBut bitcoin in China is a popular commodity to speculate on; it was officially banned as a currency since 2013.\n\nIt is only human to want recourse to a reputation or relationship, a person or institution that cares about resolving problems, rather than be faced with the implacable and uncaring logic of an algorithm\n\nMark Nuttall\n\nHong Kong has no legislation directly regulating virtual currencies, but bitcoin’s reputation as a sound financial platform has nevertheless suffered.\n\n“Bitcoin exchanges such as MyCoin have created a bad reputation for bitcoin after they closed out a year after the Mt. Gox scenario,” says Leveille of the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed in February 2014.\n\n“There were many large investors and the sudden closure had a potential combined value of HK$3 billion. Thus, banks and other large companies consider bitcoin to be too risky for investments.”\n\nThis new surge of interest in blockchain technology – nicknamed “crypto 2.0” – already has its epicentre in Hong Kong. A blockchain event, organised by MecklerMedia, will be held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre on May 24 and 25.\n\n“The new applications for distributed ledger technology are still a few years away as the regulatory regime and affected stakeholders accept the new world order,” says Leveille, who compares the current situation to the years preceding the “dotcom boom” of the late 20th century.\n\nHowever, a blockchain-driven cashless world that uses a currency based purely on data is far from inevitable. Is it even desirable?\n\nSome worry whether a digital currency designed by governments could be used to snoop on their financial affairs, while an anonymous, automated currency where no-one holds the “skeleton key” is just as scary.\n\n“Will individuals trust an anonymous code with their savings and finances or will they demand a trusted brand rather than putting their faith in technology?” says Nuttall.\n\n“It is only human to want recourse to a reputation or relationship, a person or institution that cares about resolving problems, rather than be faced with the implacable and uncaring logic of an algorithm.”\n\nFor others, the blockchain and the open ledger system it creates could bring a whole new dimension of trust to the internet. Anonymity and trust, it seems, are two sides of the same coin.', 'Markets Weekly is a column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology\'s use case as an asset class.\n\nThe price of bitcoin broke past $450 this week, as markets rallied in response to perceived progress surrounding the network\'s block capacity dilemma.\n\nThe price breakout, which took place as the digital currency surged more than 6% in the seven days through 12:00 UTC on 22nd April, ended the pattern of the last several weeks, when bitcoin fluctuated largely within a tight range.\n\n""Traders have been watching the psychological price barrier of $450 for a long time,"" Joe Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Now that was broken earlier in the week by every major exchange, eyes are on the bullish trend continuing with $480 and $500 as target prices for the three-to-six month timeframe.""\n\nVolume still modest\n\nInterestingly enough, bitcoin’s sharp rise took place amid more modest weekly trading volumes.\n\nMarket participants traded 12.96m BTC during the seven days through 7:12 EST on 22nd April, according to Bitcoinity data. As in recent weeks, OKCoin and Huobi were responsible for 49.46% and 44.6% of these transactions, respectively.\n\nBy comparison, the ether markets experienced far less volatility, ending the week close to where it started.\n\nThe token on the Ethereum blockchain network experienced 24-hour trading volume of $13.6m at roughly 12:00 UTC on 15th April, which dipped slightly to $13.4m by approximately 12:00 UTC on 22nd April.\n\nThese figures fell far short of this digital currency’s transaction activity over the last month, as 24-hour trading volume reached $22m on 24 March and $15m on 1st April.\n\nSegWit boosts outlook\n\nThe week’s most notable development was the release of the code for Segregated Witness (SegWit), an upgrade to the bitcoin protocol that will allow blocks in the blockchain to contain more transactions.\n\nThis update, which Bitcoin core developer Pieter Wuille published 19th April, is expected to make bitcoin blocks smaller by storing the part of every transaction containing a digital signature differently, when implemented.\n\nIf the bitcoin community adopts SegWit, it should significantly increase block capacity, providing a stopgap solution, observers say, to what could be a continued issue for the network should it want to accommodate more users without additional top-level networks.\n\nBut, bitcoin prices will not surge until the broader community has adopted a hard fork solution, Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, a digital currency-focused hedge fund, told CoinDesk.\n\nEven though bitcoin developers have not yet moved forward with a hard fork solution to what some consider its scaling issues, many experts emphasized that SegWit’s release has had a positive impact on both the market and community for the digital currency.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations at Whaleclub, told CoinDesk about how trader sentiment changed after bitcoin’s sharp rise pushed it above $440 on 20th April.\n\n""Trader sentiment at Whaleclub prior to [today] was predominantly short,” he said on 20th April. ""Now we’re observing a 2.8:1, long-to-short volume ratio. This is 80% higher than the average 2:1 recorded ratio, so we have an 80% excess in long positions (bullish sentiment). This evolution in sentiment shows that many shorts have closed in a small period of time (hence a short squeeze).""\n\nSentiment turns positive\n\nWhile Zivkovski supplied hard data, Christopher Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, spoke to improving overall sentiment.\n\n""Miners will soon be able to upgrade their software, and since it is a soft fork there is less fear, uncertainty, doubt around the process,"" Burniske told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n""In my eyes, this has collectively allowed a big sigh of relief for bitcoin participants.""\n\nLee, in turn, spoke to how SegWit’s release provides a blow to the arguments used by bitcoin skeptics.\n\n“I believe that we are well on our way towards the plateau of productivity as the general public come to terms with the fact that bitcoin has not died despite repeated public media stunts,” he told CoinDesk.\n\nCharles L.

The site returned on April 20th after a passionate post by the company’s CEO, Erik Voorhees, detailing their understanding of the hack. The site launched with Ethereum and Bitcoin support only. Today, Litecoin was added as well.\n\nShapeshift is known as a near instantaneous to convert a variety of cryptocurrencies to any other supported cryptocurrency without an account. At its peak, it supported 40 cryptocurrencies. That still seems to be in the company’s long term plan, but other currencies will be phased in over time.\n\n“Each coin adds complexity and development time, and many coins have special attributes that need to be cared for.” Voorhees said in response to our email. “They are like baby animals, running around the yard in various states of disarray. [. . .]We’ll have many of the other top assets back within a week or so, and everything that was supported before will be supported again soon.”\n\nThis prudent approach seems like a good idea. Shapeshift was allegedly hacked three different times over the past few months. According to Voorhees’ post, one theft was perpetrated by a then-current employee identified only as “Bob” and the other two were performed by a third party using information Bob provided to the hacker in conjunction with malware Bob allegedly installed on another employee’s computer.\n\nShapeshift works without an account and it doesn’t hold customer funds. Users send the cryptocurrency of their choice to the service, Shapeshift sells that currency on an exchange and they buy the requested currency before sending it to the address indicated by the customer. Because of this, no customer funds were lost, though the thousands of bitcoins worth hundreds of thousands of dollars lost will be a big hurdle for the company which is still in the pre-profit stage.\n\nIronically, the theft does help prove Shapeshift’s business model. Since Shapeshift didn’t lose any funds besides its own, they presumably can continue to operate normally, albeit with more stringent security protocols.\n\nAs mentioned, Ether was the first currency to join Bitcoin on the relaunched service, with Litecoin joining today. We have tested the Bitcoin to Ether conversion and can confirm that it works as expected.\n\nThe reason for its inclusion was exactly what you would expect: market demand.\n\n“Our biggest market is Bitcoin <-> Ether, so we decided to focus purely on getting that back for our customers.” Said Voorhees. Later in the email, he continued “It’s all about market demand. The Ethereum exchange volume has been consistently 10-20% of Bitcoin, which is to say, pretty significant.”\n\nWe will keep you up to date on any major developments involving Shapeshift’s relaunch.\n\n[The Zombie hand in the picture above was adopted by ofsmallthings]', 'The news last week that production for Bill & Ted 3 will most definitely begin soon came as welcomed news to the Internet. In 1989, when Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure was released, there was no Internet, and George Herbert Walker Bush was President. That’s a long time ago, dudes.\n\nSince then, both Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves have had illustrious careers. Reeves, of course, starred in the super trippy Matrix Trilogy – a science-fiction film just like Bill & Ted’s. In the original film, both Bill and Ted have dreams of becoming rock stars like Iron Maiden. For Reeves, in real life, he ultimately achieved this goal, sort of, in his band Dogstar.\n\nWinter has enjoyed a different career trajectory. Most recently, he produced Deep Web The Movie. That film looks inside the dark web and the Silk Road, in particularly the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, who was convicted of being ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’. As the About section on the documentary’s page details:\n\nThe film explores how the brightest minds and thought leaders behind the Deep Web are now caught in the crosshairs of the battle for control of a future inextricably linked to technology, with our digital rights hanging in the balance.\n\nBill and Ted’s has always incorporated technology into its theme, even if it was a bit science-fiction laden. For instance, the film centers on time travel. The first Bill & Ted’s film, Excellent Adventure, features Bill and Ted traveling through time for their final history presentation. They learn that, far in the future, Bill and Ted’s band “Wyld Stallyns” inspired a utopian society. It enjoyed commercial success and ultimately achieved cult status.\n\nConsidering Winters’ interest in deep web technology, one must wonder, considering the films science fiction bent, whether or not some of the recent technological innovations since the first Bill and Ted’s film, such as encryption and bitcoin, will play a role.\n\n“Silk Road combined bitcoin and Tor in a way that was so powerful that it created a movement and the mechanics for a new marketplace – a new way of using bitcoin. It popularised bitcoin in such a way that there’s really no going back,” Winters told CoinDesk. “I think bitcoin is very threatening to various established systems because of the community component.” Winters revealed that the Dark Web’s narrator, Reeves, also is a big fan of Bitcoin.\n\n“Keanu has been watching my cuts since the early days of this project, he’s very very interested in this story, so that’s why he got involved. He’s also into bitcoin,” Winter revealed.\n\nDean Parisot has been tied to the film, and Reeves has described it as “edgy”, which the dark net and bitcoin certainly are.\n\nReeves revealed in 2010 that Matheson and Solomon were working on a script for a third film. According to Reeves and Winter, the script was completed by spring 2011. The script has been revised numerous times. But, Alex Winter has stated they could start filming in 2016 or 2017.\n\nImages from Wikipedia and YouTube.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Rather than storing their Bitcoin funds on the Coinbase platform itself, users can transfer the funds to CoPay and still enjoy all of the functionality offered by the exchange itself.\n\nBitPay has made it a bit more convenient for users to buy and sell Bitcoin through their Copay wallet. Although this feature requires the user to have a verified Coinbase account, this could be a very powerful merger of popular Bitcoin services.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Price Technical Analysis – Perfect Sell & Consolidation\n\nBitPay Copay and Coinbase Integration\n\nIt is not the first time BitPay mentions exchange integration in their Copay multisignature solution, however, now we finally know which platform will be used. The choice was made to integrate Coinbase into the Copay wallet solution, giving users an easy way to sell Bitcoin, or buy cryptocurrency through bank transfers and plastic cards.\n\nWhat makes this integration noteworthy is how this particular service is accessible across all US states, Canada, and 30 other countries around the world. However, there is a buying limit imposed of US$1,000 per day, which should suit the needs of most Copay users. Users will need a verified Coinbase account to make use of this new feature, though.\n\nBut there’s more to this integration, as the merging of Copay and Coinbase is also an exciting development for exchange users. Rather than storing their Bitcoin funds on the Coinbase platform itself, users can transfer the funds to CoPay and still enjoy all of the functionality offered by the exchange itself. There is no requirement to do so, but it never hurts to have more options at one’s disposal.\n\nThe decision to integrate Coinbase into the Bitpay Copay wallet solution seems to be the right call. The Bitcoin exchange has been around since 2011 and is one of the oldest cryptocurrency platforms in the world still active today. Moreover, it is one of the few platforms that lets users pay through traditional payment methods such as credit and debit cards, a payment method that is usually not associated with buying Bitcoin.\n\nAll in all, this integration brings more functionality and security to the table. A Multisignature Bitcoin wallet combined with an embedded option to buy and sell cryptocurrency on the fly will be a powerful tool for novice cryptocurrency users. Moreover, experienced Bitcoin users will enjoy this type of functionality as well, as it combines some of the most commonly used Bitcoin services into one solution.\n\nSource: BitPay\n\nHeader image courtesy of Copay', 'A father-son duo from the state of Louisiana pleaded guilty to operating an illegal, unlicensed bitcoin exchange.\n\nAn announcement from the U.S. Department of Justice revealed that Randall Lord, 58 and his son Michael Lord, 29, both from Shreveport, Louisiana, plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money servicing business.\n\nIn addition to the charge, Michael Lord also pleaded guilty to one count of agreeing to distribute Schedule IV controlled drug and anti-anxiety medication alprazolam.\n\nThe duo also failed to report the receipt of over $10,000 in U.S. dollars.\n\nIn a statement via a media release, the Department of Justice stated:\n\nAccording to the guilty plea, from at least 2013 to 2015, the defendants were accepting currency, money orders and money paks from exchanging those funds for bitcoin, a decentralized form of electronic or digital currency, existing entirely on the Internet and not in any physical form. Contrary to law, the Lords were not registered with FinCEN or licensed to operate as a money service business with the State of Louisiana.\n\nBoth defendants face five years in prison for the conspiracy count of running the unlicensed bitcoin exchange and the younger Lord faces five years for the drug count. The duo also face a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release.\n\nThe sentencing date is set on August 1, 2016.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Zebpay, a mobile wallet for Bitcoins, has crossed trading turnover of Rs 100 crore. Currently, Zebpay has a total of over 30,000 users, who use the app to buy, sell, store and spend bitcoins. The company said 6,000 new users are added every month.\n\nZebpay was started in 2012 by Mahin Gupta. The company raised $1 million series A funding led by Arjun Handa and Amit Jindal, along with other investors. A report by PTI says that Zebpay deals with Indian customers only and it has made PAN number a must for users for opening of wallet.\n\nThe Android app has new features exclusively for pro Bitcoin users in March. These features allow users to set their own buying and selling price. Users can also keep Rupee balance in the app to buy bitcoin anytime.\n\nTo recap, Bitcoins are a digital currency whose value is determined by demand and supply. Bitcoins are available only in limited numbers. Only 21 million Bitcoins can be generated globally and the last bitcoin will be generated in 2140. However, the value of Bitcoins fluctuates wildly. For example, the value of a Bitcoin was $448 yesterday but had hit values as high as $1,100 in 2013.\n\nMany buy bitcoins as an investment with the belief that the Bitcoin price will rise. Some buy as a hedge against currency devaluation. Many have started accepting bitcoins as payment from their overseas customers.\n\nRBI’ stance\n\nEarlier in December 2013, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a warning that it will not regulate any Virtual Currency including Bitcoin in India and warned people who were dealing with the currency in India of the risks involved, saying that they’re exposing them to financial, legal, operational and security related risk.\n\nHowever, in August, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan also mentioned that the apex bank is closely monitoring crypto currencies but has so far not intervened in them. “I would like to say that our philosophy is if it is small then let it develop, let us see how it works and then take a view. That was our attitude towards crypto currencies. It was very very small,” Rajan added.\n\nDevelopments in Bitcoin in India\n\n– In January 2014, Income Tax department was looking at how they can impose tax on Bitcoin miners in India in the long run. However, they said they will not start this until the RBI gives a clean chit to the virtual currency.\n\n– Around the same time, the Enforcement directorate raided the office of Buysellbit.co.in and RBItco, websites that let people buy and sell bitcoin. According to ED, these website were in violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) rules as the central bank does not provide permission to make such transactions.\n\n– In the same month, a notice was sent to the RBI seeking clarification on various aspects around Bitcoin. RBI was asked if it plans to treat virtual currency – as a foreign currency, domestic currency, private currency, commodity, software program or as an electronic document. It was also asked if RBI has the power to regulate virtual currencies and if so, under what law.\n\n– In February 2014, Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox went offline and stopped operations. According to a leaked document 744,408 Bitcoin worth $375 million are missing due to malleability-related theft which went unnoticed for several years.\n\nOur Bitcoin coverage here', 'Cashila, a bitcoin payment and bitcoin-to-euro conversion service, has partnered with Bitnik Reload, a Slovenian bitcoin service that automatically repurchases spent bitcoin from exchanges. The partnership will allow people to live truly on bitcoin, according to Jani Valjavec, co-founder of Cashila.\n\nThe partnership allows users to pay quickly and easily while repurchasing bitcoin from a variety of exchanges, Valjavec noted in a Cashila blog.\n\nCashila’s Unique Service\n\nCashila allows bitcoin users to convert bitcoins to euros and vice versa. Users can make payments to bank accounts directly. It serves as a EUR wallet that allows users to transfer fiat, receive third party fiat or bitcoin deposits, keep funds in the wallet or convert them to bitcoin.\n\nReload is a service that binds a bitcoin wallet to a bitcoin exchange account. As soon as a user spends bitcoins from their wallet, Reload uses their exchange account to instantly repurchase the same amount of bitcoins. To use Reload, a user has to provide their bitcoin wallet public address and API credentials provided by their bitcoin exchange\n\nWhy The Partnership?\n\nCashila was built to give users the ability to convert bitcoins to euros quickly.\n\nTo promote more bitcoin adoption for regular payments, users need to use bitcoin as much as possible. The Bitnik Reload partnership is part of that mission. Reload automatically repurchases all the bitcoin a user spends from their exchange.\n\nCashila customers can use their default bitcoin address to make payments and transfers. They can use it to purchase goods, pay bills, send cash or make cross-border payments. Reload monitors users’ public bitcoin addresses, and when it notices a transfer, it automatically repurchases the bitcoins so the user never runs out of bitcoin.\n\nIn our opinion, we have to support bitcoin’s day-to-day usage, since it is the only way to spread mass adoption. With Cashila and Reload you can now start using your bitcoins and never worry about your supply or volatility again. Pay your bills with Cashila and leave Reload to reliably and automatically repurchase spent bitcoins for you in seconds.\n\nBitnik Reload provides this service anonymously and without charge.\n\nAn Example Of How It Works\n\nIf a user wants to pay 100 EUR (0.25 BTC) on car insurance, they can transfer their bitcoin to any European bank account. The 0.25 BTC converts to euros and is deposited via bank transfer and received by the counterparty by the next business day in most cases. Reload will immediately buy 0.25 BTC from a local exchange of the user’s choice. The user can rest assured they will not lose their bitcoin supply.\n\nUsers can transfer funds to the euro-zone from anyplace in the world and always get the best price.\n\nRemember To Use Bitcoin!\n\nBitcoin users who have euros might think it’s more convenient to use euros in some cases. Valjavec reminds them that for bitcoin to succeed, users need to use bitcoin as much as possible.\n\nUsability is what gives bitcoin its value. People who believe in bitcoin recognize its benefits: its use is not limited to working hours, and it has no borders. A user can send funds to Europe from Latin America at night at a fraction of the cost of a bank transfer.\n\nAlso read: 7 new ways to easily integrate bitcoin into your business\n\nHow To Set Up Reload\n\nTo establish the Reload service, the user sets up a payment-only bitcoin wallet to use when sending funds to Cashila. Here is the process:\n\n1. Register at Reload.\n\n2. Set the bitcoin wallet public addresses on the “reload” list. There is a list of supported wallets.\n\n3. Connect the local bitcoin exchange to the Reload account via the API.\n\n4. Upload funds to the exchange so Reload can use them to instantly buy bitcoin at the market price.\n\nThe payment process is as follows:\n\n1) Login to Cashila.\n\n2) Select “pay” and enter the desired amount and the bank details of the recipient.\n\n3) Pay from the payment addresses previously linked to Reload.\n\n4) Reload instantly rebuys the bitcoins.\n\n5) Cashila sends the funds to the recipient’s bank.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Cashila.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Ethereum startup Ethcore has raised $750,000 in a preliminary, pre-seed funding round led by Silicon Valley-based Blockchain Capital and Shanghai-based Fenbushi Capital.\n\nEthcore intends to further pursue the development of the Ethereum blockchain stack and assist partners who wish to innovate using the smart contract platform. The startup was also awarded a grant by the U.K. government’s Innovate UK to create a “next-generation foundational distributed ledger platform for institutional communication, authorisation, and consensus.”\n\nEthereum has gained momentum in 2016, with the market cap of the Ether cryptocurrency recently topping $1 billion before settling back down around $650 million.\n\nWhat Is Ethcore?\n\nEthcore was founded by Ethereum co-founder and former CTO Gavin Wood. Along with Vitalik Buterin, Wood co-designed the Ethereum protocol and took a lead in various parts of the Ethereum ecosystem, including devising the Solidity programming language, refining the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and writing the acclaimed Yellow Paper, the first formal specification of a blockchain protocol.\n\nWood is joined by several other members of the core Ethereum team. including former head of operations Aeron Buchanan, head of communications Ken Kappler, head of security Jutta Steiner, and core developers Arkadiy Paronyan and Marek Kotewicz. According to Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brad Stephens, it would be fair to analogize Ethcore as Ethereum’s version of Blockstream, which is a startup focused on developing improvements for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHaving said that, there are some differences between their respective business models. Stephens told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“Ethcore is much more focused on building licensed, proprietary tools for large financial institutions, exchanges, and so forth, as opposed to the more open-sourced, Red Hat approach Blockstream is taking ... One of Ethcore’s main value propositions is that they know Ethereum better than anyone, and thus the tools they build and deploy should buttress and catalyze Ethereum as a whole.”\n\nAlthough Ethcore is building proprietary tools, they\'ll also be helping out the Ethereum community with their various open-source projects.\n\nButerin, who is an Ethereum Foundation board member and a partner at Fenbushi Capital, has stated, ""We\'re excited to see the progress that Ethcore is making on bringing Ethereum technology to the next level through their full implementation of the Ethereum protocol in Parity, and look forward to seeing what the team will continue to bring.”\n\nWhat Can Ethcore Do for Ethereum?\n\nEthcore will attempt to solve some of the current issues facing the Ethereum blockchain (and other blockchains) such as privacy and scalability. Gavin Wood told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“We have developed high-level designs for tackling scalability and privacy that can help us overcome some of the problems and help in various settings. They\'ll be implemented over this year. We\'ll expect a much more scalable public blockchain in the next couple of years.”\n\nIn terms of privacy, Wood added, “Full privacy is still a research area with some interesting ideas that we’ll be watching closely – but semi-trusted architectures on which we are working will do for many cases, particularly in the area of permissioned ledgers.”\n\nButerin also shared his thoughts on the future of privacy and scalability in Ethereum with Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n""In the case of privacy, the basic building blocks (ring signatures, ZKPs, state channels, CT-style value encryption) are imo fairly understood and established, and it is primarily a matter of turning them into functional tools that can be used in production applications. In the case of scalability, the Ethereum research team is fairly committed to sharding; we feel that it does a good job of combining the benefits of being an on-chain scaling strategy with the decentralization benefits of maintaining a network that can theoretically run off of nothing but consumer laptops.""\n\nButerin added, ""There are details that are still being worked on, but [in my opinion] a lot of them are solidifying rapidly; we have a team that is starting work on a proof of concept in Python incorporating many of our ideas for future versions of the protocol, and we plan to validate them there before beginning development for mainline.""\n\nEthcore recently released the first version of their premium Ethereum client, Parity. In addition to tackling privacy and scalability issues, Ethcore’s software technology roadmap also includes improvements for light-clients for secure Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications and permissioned blockchains. The startup also intends to create application-level libraries for use by developers and third-party projects.\n\nAccording to Wood, the startup is currently working with French banking giant BNP Paribas on possible applications of Ethcore’s technology within the world of finance. Many applications within the Etheruem ecosystem, such as Digix, Augur, Grid Singularity, and Slock.it are also looking at Ethcore’s technology.\n\nBlockchain Capital’s Thoughts on Ethereum and Rootstock\n\nWhen asked if Blockchain Capital will invest in other, future Ethereum projects, Brad Stephens replied, “Assuming that the multi-chain world we have been forecasting for some time now comes to fruition, it’s hard to imagine not investing further in the Ethereum ecosystem.”\n\nStephens also noted that the venture capital firm already has another stealth Ethereum startup. He added:\n\n“We have been taking lots of meetings with companies building on the Ethereum blockchain. Moreover, we have seen a steady uptick in Ethereum side projects and initiatives coming out of our portfolio companies.”\n\nStephens stated that Ethereum is still a “nascent technology,” which means many of its initial, obvious use cases will not come to fruition over the near term, as was the case with Bitcoin.\n\nIn terms of Rootstock, which is a Bitcoin sidechain, Stephens said the Ethereum-esque project plays no role in the potential success of Ethereum as a platform. Stephens explained his reasoning:\n\n“Rootstock is an exciting project. A few weeks ago, the developers announced that Rootstock will take a 20 percent cut of every transaction, which makes them an intermediary, and possibility an operator from a legal perspective. There’s no reason not to cut them out, pay all the fees to miners, and increase security. Or just use Ethereum.”\n\n“Ethereum’s market capitalization has grown so immensely in the past few months, it’s getting harder to make the security argument that once existed for Bitcoin over Ethereum,” Stephens told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThis article has been updated with further thoughts on privacy from Vitalik Buterin.\n\nDisclosure: Fenbushi Capital is an investor in BTC Media, Bitcoin Magazine\'s parent company.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

When he's not writing, trading, or interviewing people, you can find him swimming, reading or taking one of his hobbies to the next level."", 'Mike Hearn wrote a Medium post which went viral and was the topic of much debate in the Bitcoin world. In his opinion, the Bitcoin community was dead.\n\nHe wrote: “[Bitcoin] has failed because the community has failed… Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse.”\n\nHearn has spent considerable time in the trenches of the Bitcoin technology. He is one of the foremost Bitcoin experts in the world. If anyone had enough perspective to make such a bold proclamation, it was he.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is priced at approximately $445, according to the Coinbase price. When many first entered the Bitcoin space, the price was $4. Plans to launch a Bitcoin ETF, by the Winklevoss twins and others, persist. IBM’s leading blockchain minds celebrate the Bitcoin technology behind closed doors.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Has Died Nearly 100 Times\n\nCEO of international-payments app TransferWise, Taavet Hinrikus, recently said: “Bitcoin, I think we can say, is dead. There is no traction, no one is using bitcoin. The bitcoin experiment, I think we can say, is over.”Bitcoin transaction use, excluding popular addresses even, demonstrates a steady increase over time.\n\nIn the interview with Yahoo Finance, while promoting his company’s Mexico launch Hinrikus sounded very ignorant on the topic of Bitcoin.\n\n“What really happened was a gold rush,” he said. “People bought bitcoin because they thought it would be worth more tomorrow. And a lot of people got lucky. But we’re not seeing real people use bitcoin. And we don’t know what problem it solves. Now, blockchain, I think, is a genius advancement in technology. But I’m not sure we’re seeing yet where to apply it. I’m pretty excited about R3 and Digital Asset Holdings. I think there are many areas where using blockchain is great, but it’s still early days.”\n\nHinrikus brings nothing new or interesting to the discussion about neither Bitcoin nor blockchain. Bitcoin is worth more today than yesterday – in a macro sense – and people have long stated what problem it solves: efficient and verifiable records of data. In the Bitcoin example, blockchain’s solutions are applied to digital payments (you know, what Hinrikus does). There are other, politically-loaded use cases for Bitcoin but we don’t need to touch on those to address Hinrikus. His comments on blockchain follow the Party Line, quite boringly, and bring nothing new or interesting to the discussion.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, as the puff piece on TransferWise at Yahoo states, has opined that Bitcoin is “doomed.” His firm is working with R3 CEV on how blockchain can be applied to finance. He believes Bitcoin doesn’t have much a future because of the political pressure that will be put on it. Many others cite this, as well, as a reason why Bitcoin could face headwinds ahead. That, for instance, it does not have a KYC nor AML layer, makes Bitcoin a target.\n\nTransferWise is not a bitcoin company. The company promises customers faster transfers, and smaller fees, on remittances internationally. These are the solutions Bitcoin provides. TransferWise and Bitcoin are, in some ways, competitors.\n\nAs CCN reported, Bitcoin’s death is continuously, greatly exaggerated. It’s had obit after obit written for it.\n\nHinrikus’ accolades include being the first hire at Skype, where he was director of strategy. Included among his investors are Peter Thiel and others.\n\n“We’ve certainly paid lots of attention to bitcoin and blockchain,” Hinrikus said. Notice, Hinrikus doesn’t say he’s ever paid in the currency; that is, he’s never used Bitcoin. So, objectively, he doesn’t have firsthand experience with the currency and, thus, how it works. It doesn’t sound like he has a competent blockchain advisor either. Can he be trusted to form an objective and academic opinion on Bitcoin? No. His opinion can’t be trusted, in particularly considering his space, digital payments, is in the middle of a disruption kicked off by the Bitcoin technology and his firm is in the middle of it.\n\nAs a newcomer to fintech, as the puff piece by Yahoo states of Hinrikus, perhaps he is not in a position to make such proclamations without lending himself to criticism of egoism and sensationalism.\n\nYahoo concludes: “If tech entrepreneurs like Hinrikus feel they no longer need to keep paying attention, that could be a problem for the coin and its future viability.”\n\nI don’t think this is true. It’s not tech entrepreneurs like Hinrikus who have been using the technology, as he seemingly admits, in the first place.\n\nAs a Bitcoin skeptic myself (but also a user), Hinrikus’ comments come off as disingenuous and self-serving. He’d best market his product through promotional offers and successful use cases than belittling new technologies.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The team behind Steam, a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation offering digital rights management, multiplayer gaming and social networking services, has announced that the platform will officially begin to accept payments via bitcoin.\n\nCoinTelegraph has reached out to Bitpay for more information about their partnership with Steam. We will continue to update the article as we receive more information from the Bitpay team.\n\nImplementation of a third party Bitcoin application\n\nGaming giant Valve and the developers behind Steam hinted the integration of Bitpay on February 9, 2016, when some Steam users discovered a series of Bitpay command lines from Steam translation servers.\n\nSome of the command lines included “bitcoin_payment_tips_text,” which are needed by Steam users to purchase rights to games and various services using bitcoin.\n\nOn April 21, the company officially announced the implementation of a third party Bitcoin application to enable its DRM users to purchase products and services using bitcoin.\n\n“We are excited to announce that Steam is going to start accepting payments via bitcoin.,” said Valve Corporation software engineer Kurtis Chinn\n\nReaching more customers\n\nThe Steam development team will introduce its bitcoin payment option to Steam users in its next update.\n\nKurtis Chinn says:\n\n“We’re using an external payment provider to process bitcoin payments to help partners reach more customers on Steam. Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly popular online payment method in some countries, and we’re enabling a system that insulates partners from risk and volatility while still providing value to end customer.”\n\nAlthough the date of it is still undisclosed, Chinn explained that users that choose to pay using bitcoin will undergo the same payment process as normal users using credit cards or online payment processing platforms such as Paypal to purchase games and services.\n\nWhile many bitcoin enthusiasts and online communities predict the integration of Bitpay considering the discovery of Bitpay command lines a few months ago, the Bitpay team hasn’t released any statement yet regarding their partnership with Steam.', 'While Bitcoin still receives a cold shoulder from many mainstream banking and financial institutions, its underlying technology has become the talk of the town. Blockchain technology is now being increasingly recognized by many industries, most of whom have already taken enough interest to invest time and money in its research.\n\nAs a part of its coverage into bitcoin and blockchain technology, Bloomberg has interviewed Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities about the future of blockchain technology. Wedbush Securities is a leading securities firm and an investment bank in the United states. It offers a wide range of innovative financial solutions through its various divisions.\n\nAccording to Gil Luria, research and development in bitcoin technology is a constantly ongoing process. The developers involved in the project are constantly striving to make it more robust and flexible.\n\nEven though the digital currency is not keeping up its frequent appearance in the media, its usage for making online payments, cross-border remittance and as an alternative to traditional financial services in places that don’t have access to it. Bitcoin is also being used by people in countries implementing stringent capital controls to transfer their fortune from one place to another.\n\nGil Luria, in response to the question by Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal and Scarlet Fu about blockchain technology, clarifies the difference between bitcoin and its underlying technology. Blockchain is superseding bitcoin when it comes to investments made by big banks and investment firms. Many banking and financial institutions have already invested their time and resources in the development of a private blockchain network for their regular operations. While bitcoin is used for payment applications, blockchain is used for an entirely different range of applications. According to him, blockchain is a vast tool suitable for asset classes while bitcoin serves a much simpler purpose of making payments and executing simple banking functions.\n\nHe also clears the air about the speculation that only blockchain technology will continue to be important while bitcoin will fade away in the coming years. Bitcoin and blockchain, both do entirely different functions. Even though blockchain is the underlying technology that makes the existence of bitcoin network as it is today possible, it is much bigger than bitcoin itself.\n\nAcceding to Gil Luria’s prediction, in less than two decades, we can see expect most financial services being delivered over one form of blockchain or another. At the same time, bitcoin will soon be considered as a safe haven, like gold for saving the hard earned money. However, it may take a while before blockchain can be widely implemented at an institutional level. Once the blockchain is implemented, the same companies and financial institutions will adopt bitcoin as well, as an instrument to transfer funds or value across the network.\n\nBitcoin and Blockchain offer completely different yet related solutions to the banking and financial sector. Implementing both of them together will bring the much-needed change in the traditional fintech sector.', 'Custos Media Technologies, a Stellenbosch, South Africa-based company that uses the blockchain to fight media piracy, marks one of the more unusual but interesting commercial applications of bitcoin. A pair of academics, G-J van Rooyen and Dr. Herman Engelbrecht, came up with the idea after working in “pre-commercial” research for the better part of the last decade focusing on real-world applications of cutting edge technology.\n\nEngelbrecht and van Rooyen co-founded the Media Lab at Stellenbosch University that was specifically created for this type of research.\n\n“We spent several years working on media distribution and content protection along with the Lab’s founding sponsor, Naspers,” van Rooyen told CCN. Naspers is a large multinational media corporation focused mostly on developing markets. “This gave us a very good understanding of how the world of digital media operates.”\n\n2013: A Watershed Year\n\nThe pair followed bitcoin from its inception, but 2013 was a watershed year for the cryptocurrency. “It suddenly became very obvious that bitcoin has broken out of the ‘very interesting idea’ phase and has achieved traction as a ‘real-world’ technology,” van Rooyen said. “Also, the potential of colored coins, smart contracts and micropayment streams were just being realized. We decided to actively look at potential bitcoin applications, and especially at the ways it intersects with the Media Lab’s core research areas.”\n\nIn academia, you quickly learn that the romantic notion of sudden research breakthroughs and flashes of insight are mostly movie stuff, van Rooyen said. “Mostly, research is slowly pushing at the edge of knowledge, and making incremental contributions. You don’t have a chat with clever colleagues and suddenly ‘invent something.’”\n\nBut in van Rooyen’s and Engelbrecht’s case, that’s exactly what happened.\n\nAn Epiphany Arrives\n\nEngelbrecht was struck with the idea that the blockchain could be used to track ownership in some way (much like ascribe.io does today). His colleague wasn’t far behind.\n\n“I recalled an experience I had several years before, where I purchased an ebook that had my credit card details embedded as a visible footnote in each page, and wondered aloud whether we can’t use bitcoin to impose a similar ‘owner responsibility’ on digital media recipients. We pulled in Fred Lutz, who was then doing his master’s in economics in the Media Lab (and was a huge bitcoin enthusiast), and threw some more ideas around.”\n\n“By that afternoon, we had the invention written up and at our patent office.”\n\nA Company Is Born\n\nvan Rooyen has since resigned his position as associate professor at Stellenbosch University to spend all of his time with Custos as CEO. Lutz finished his master’s thesis on the economy of digital piracy and joined Custos full-time as COO. Engelbrecht remains at the university and has a part-time involvement in the company.\n\nCustos uses technology that watermarks bitcoin into a piece of media that it tracks in the blockchain to identify infringements. The system uses crowdsourcing to provide a bounty to downloaders who identify pirates. Content creators and distributors can embed an identifying code into each piece of content that they provide to a particular user.\n\nThe code embedded in each piece of content can be used to access a deposit in the form of cryptocurrency – a “finder’s fee.” If the content is leaked or shared and a third party gets ahold of the content, they can cash the code in for the finder’s fee.\n\nCustos Has Customers\n\nThis bounty has already been imbedded in media content, van Rooyen said.\n\n“Most of our current content are feature films created by independent film studios, through our online service http://screenercopy.com,” he noted.\n\nCustos’ “Screener Copy” website indicates there is a beta test that is closed. Van Rooyen said this is a bit ambiguous since the service is already in use. “Closed beta” in software projects means that clients can use it on an invitation-only basis, he explained. “This allows us to carefully test the offering and grow the bounty hunting community in a controlled way. It is actively being used, with very positive beta client feedback.”\n\nHe compared it to the way Facebook originally only did a very controlled rollout to individual campuses before opening up to everyone. “It’s a responsible, managed way of testing and proving a complex technology.”\n\nMedia Piracy On The Rise\n\nHow extensive is media piracy? “Firstly, it depends on who you ask,” he said. “Occasionally, you hear the opinion that piracy is a net positive to the media industry because it is actually a form of marketing. However, this assumes that only a small percentage of consumers engage in piracy.\n\n“Today, we find ourselves in a media distribution market where an ever-shrinking percentage of users pay ever-rising prices for legitimate content, and an ever-growing percentage of users are getting the same content for free. Clearly, this is not sustainable – content creators must have some sustainable business model to recoup expenses and create new content.”\n\nThe middle-of-the-road estimate is that content piracy creates losses of about $22 billion to the industry. This is revenue that could have gone into creating more high-quality, diverse content.\n\nPiracy’s Bigger Cost\n\nA common fallacy is that piracy is an all-or-nothing thing. “For example, movie studios still have great box office successes – clearly piracy isn’t killing the movie industry? The problem is that revenue losses don’t cause the industry to collapse: like any business, the movie industry tries to reduce revenue risk. This is done by creating more content that has a high chance of box-office revenue despite some piracy; typically superhero flicks, action movies, and romcoms. Over the past decade, we’ve seen a steady decline in the production of riskier, more ‘interesting’ movies, and a very strong focus on the sure hits. In the short term, this is throttling the art form. In the longer term, the AAA movie title in itself may become commercially unsustainable unless the distribution model is re-invented.”\n\nCustos has met with three of the “Big 6” studios, as well as with the “mini-majors.” The reaction has been positive regarding the potential of the technology. Further meetings are planned.\n\nAlso read: Block chain anti-piracy provider Custos gains seed funding\n\nBook Publishers At Risk\n\nMovie producers aren’t the only content producers experiencing piracy. Book publishers may be suffering a greater threat than the movie industry, van Rooyen said. “Big-hit movies at least have the opening weekend to recoup expenses; but unless you’re J.K. Rowling or Dan Brown, books don’t have anything similar. E-book piracy is rampant, difficult to avoid, and consumers resent traditional forms of ebook DRM.”\n\nCollege textbooks are hit particularly badly. They are very expensive to produce, and have limited circulation. “It’s often a grudge purchase for the student, and this again causes the bad feedback: the more students pirate electronic copies of textbooks, the more expensive it becomes for the honest ones – which exacerbates the piracy problem.”\n\nCustos is currently doing an ebook protection trial with a partner (Erudition Digital) in the U.K., and has just been featured at the London Book Fair.\n\nMany small, independent producers are experimenting with ways of taking content direct to consumers, and breaking out of the 20th-century model of a movie studio, van Rooyen said.\n\nPlatforms such as Alexandria and LBRY are providing very compelling new ways for creators to bring content directly to their audiences, monetize it without a middleman, and creating decentralized content distribution networks.\n\n“Of course, bitcoin itself is ideally suited to media distribution. Licensed digital content leans itself very well to frictionless global payment.”\n\nImages from Shutterstock and LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Infected by ransomware, hospitals around the country have been forced to pay hefty sums to criminal hackers.\n\nOne of the most extreme cases took place in February, when Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center handed over $17,000 to hackers who took over its systems. Since then, two other hospitals in California, as well as in Kentucky and Maryland, were also hit.\n\nWhile ransomware isn’t new, it was rare in the past for hospitals to be targeted, according to Kevin Haley, director of Symantec Security Response.\n\nWhat changed? That $17,000 payday made headlines.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmbed Hospital Pays Hackers $17K Ransom to Regain Control of Computers 2:00 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\n“This was a very public case of a hospital paying a great deal of money to make a problem go away,” Haley told NBC News. “I think it led to the targeting of these organizations.”\n\nRead More: Hacking of Health Care Records Skyrockets\n\nIt wouldn’t be such a pressing problem if hackers were attacking other types of businesses. But hospital computers contain a wealth of sensitive data from patients, and staff need to be able to communicate 24 hours a day. The rise of smart medical devices, which can also be hacked, have raised the stakes even higher.\n\nMore money, more problems\n\nRansomware is malware that infects a computer and then encrypts files until victims pay to have them unlocked. Usually, hackers target individuals for $300 to $400 each, Haley said. But the rise of bitcoin has made demanding large amounts of money more feasible.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency traded anonymously. In the past, ransomware was disguised as virus protection software or a message from the FBI in the hopes of tricking someone into handing over their credit card number. With bitcoin, there is no need for deception. Hackers don’t need to hide their intentions because the transactions are so difficult to track.\n\nHollywood Presbyterian Medical Center confirmed that it paid 40 bitcoins, equivalent to around $17,000, to bring its systems back online. The other recent attacks also involved demands for bitcoin. No longer do criminals need complicated schemes to funnel cash.\n\nRead More: Three U.S. Hospitals Hit in String of Ransomware Attacks\n\n“Bitcoin takes a little bit of sophistication, but overall, it isn’t anything you can’t learn by going on Wikipedia,” Ed Cabrera, vice president of cybersecurity strategy for Trend Micro, told NBC News.\n\nPair that with the fact that ransomware isn’t incredibly difficult for your average hacker to acquire, and you have a formula for disaster. Overall, according to statistics from Symantec, there was an average of 1,000 ransomware attacks per day in 2015, an increase of 35 percent from the year before. This year, there have been days where that number has reached 4,000. Very few of them are attacks against hospitals, of course, but that could change as hackers eye bigger and bigger ransoms.\n\n“Everybody is running from whatever they were doing to this,” Haley said, “because the dollars are big, the risk is low, and it’s easy to get into.”\n\nHospitals become targets\n\nLast month, ransomware hit three California hospitals — Desert Valley Hospital, Chino Valley Medical Center and Alvarado Hospital Medical Center — run by Prime Healthcare, forcing them to shut down their systems. Radiology and “other ancillary services” were down for several days, a company spokesperson told NBC News, but no patient or employee records were compromised.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmbed Protect yourself from hackers who can hold your personal info hostage 3:43 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nIn the end, Prime Healthcare was able to recover without paying the ransom. But there is a lot of pressure on hospitals to do the opposite. Hollywood Presbyterian said in a statement sent to NBC News that it handed over the $17,000 in the “best interest of restoring normal operations” after communications within the hospital were completely shut down.\n\nUnfortunately, preventing these kinds of attacks in the future won’t be easy.\n\n“There are a lot of different layers to a hospital,” Cabrera said. There are patient and outpatient records, insurance documents, internal communications and a host of other files being handled by multiple vendors. And if it all fails? People with serious health problems could be denied care.\n\nDespite how critical their operations are, most hospitals lag behind financial institutions and other businesses that have been dealing with these kinds of attacks for years, according to Cabrera.\n\n“As a whole, you look at healthcare, and it’s not at the leading edge when it comes to cybersecurity,” he said.\n\nMost often, ransomware infects a computer through an email attachment. Hospitals not only need to beef up security so they can detect malicious files earlier, they also have to train employees not to open them. Constantly patching vulnerabilities is vital, too, according to Cabrera.\n\nRead More: Disruptive \'Ransomware\' Hackers Have a Savvy Business Plan\n\nAll of this takes money. \u200bThe healthcare industry is ""ill-prepared"" to face these threats, according to a report from ABI Research, because it ""spends very little on cybersecurity, comparatively to other regulated critical industries."" The report claims that less than 10 percent of cybersecurity spending by 2020 will be from the healthcare industry.\n\nHospitals also have to spend to develop contingency plans in case things go wrong. That includes deciding which files get backed up and how often.\n\nPrime Healthcare said that it had ""multiple levels of backup"" that protected important files from being affected, and that it worked with ""national expert incidence response firms"" to respond quickly to the attacks.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmbed Hospital Chain Struggles To Get Back Online After Crippling Cyber Attack 1:53 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nFortunately, nobody was hurt during the ransomware incidents. For hospitals, the worst-case scenario involves hackers taking over smart devices that monitor vital signs and deliver drugs.\n\n“If it has an IP address and an attacker can reach it, it becomes fair game,” Cabrera said.\n\nThe negatives might not outweigh the positives in healthcare when it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT). By 2025, according to a McKinsey report, remote monitoring with smart devices could create as much as $1.1 trillion a year in value by improving the health of people with chronic diseases.\n\nRead More: U.S. Infrastructure Can Be Hacked With Google, Simple Passwords\n\nRight now, said Cabrera, patients can probably rest easy. It\'s not worth it for hackers to go after smart devices, he said, since traditional networks are so easy to target and lucrative to attack. But IoT security is something that hospitals will increasingly have to watch.\n\nIn the end, it falls on the leadership of hospitals to make sure cybersecurity is a priority, because there really isn\'t much patients can do to protect themselves.\n\n“If these attacks make hospitals take a hard look at their security and take these threats seriously, in the end it could be a good thing,” Haley said. “This is a risk they can’t ignore anymore.”', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'The Russian government seems concerned about the risks Bitcoin poses, and assessing these risks might be more favorable than banning cryptocurrency altogether.\n\nThe situation of Bitcoin in Russia will remain fickle for the time being as the local government appears to have trouble making up its mind regarding cryptocurrency in general. Despite trying to take strong legal action against Bitcoin usage, there are now Russian parliament members for holding a cryptocurrency conference.\n\nAlso read: Gil Luria : Bitcoin and Blockchain Have Their Own Futures\n\nThe Russian Cryptocurrency Conference of 2016\n\nAlthough the event is called “Electronic Currency in Light of Contemporary legal and Economic Challenges”, it is clear this conference talks about cryptocurrency and not digital cash. Whether or not the organizers will focus on regulation of Bitcoin in the country as well, remains unknown for now.\n\nThis news is a rather surprising turn of events, given Russia’s stance on Bitcoin in recent months. Not only have they blocked various news sites related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, but there is also a plan on the table to make cryptocurrency involvement punishable by law, for both citizens and enterprises alike.\n\nHowever, the Russian government seems concerned about the risks Bitcoin poses, and assessing these risks might be more favorable than banning cryptocurrency altogether. Additionally, the country wants to focus on innovation in the financial sector, of which Bitcoin is an integral part.\n\nFrom the information we have received, it becomes clear this conference will focus on various subjects related to cryptocurrency. Many people feel Bitcoin is a tool for criminal actions, which heralds more regulation. However, overregulation will hinder growth in the financial sector, which should be avoided at all costs.\n\nLeading scientists have been invited to this cryptocurrency conference, as well as members of Parliament, representatives of the Russian Civic Chamber, experts, and Bitcoin entrepreneurs. No details have been revealed as to which members of the Bitcoin community will be invited, as an open dialogue is more favorable than making decisions behind closed doors. Then again, this is Russia we are talking about, a country not exactly known for its open nature towards touchy subjects.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this Russian Bitcoin conference will play out in the long run. Planning is still in the early stages, and the information is very hard to come by right now. Russia is not keen on Bitcoin, but outright banning it could be a not-so-smart decision.\n\nSource: Forklog\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Moreover, the Keza mobile app had no deposit minimum, which made it quite appealing to everyone in the world.\n\nThe world of Bitcoin startups is no guarantee for quick success, as the Keza team found out the hard way.

Bitcoin users would be able to invest in US stocks from just about anywhere in the world. Additionally, the team engineers had created a mobile app for iOS users not too long ago, which would put the company on the global map.\n\nPart of the Keza offering was to attract all types of Bitcoin investors, regardless of their previous experience. Portfolios could be created based on the risk factor, although riskier options gave access to much more volatile assets. By using Bitcoin, investors all over the world could track their investments in a convenient way.\n\nMoreover, the Keza mobile app had no deposit minimum, which made it quite appealing to everyone in the world. The company expected most of their platform users to come from emerging markets, where access to proper investment vehicles is very restricted. But as it turns out, their offering still hit some glass ceilings, forcing them to shut it down completely a few days ago.\n\nThe company statement reads:\n\n“Thanks for Your Support. The Keza project is no longer moving forward, we appreciate all the feedback we have received from beta users. Please direct any questions to [email protected]. “\n\nIt is always a shame to see Bitcoin companies fail, especially during their beta testing period. Additionally, the company did not provide too many details as to why this decision was made, stunning everybody in the Bitcoin world with surprise. Speculation is running wild on Reddit as to why this decision was made, ranging from regulatory issues to funding problems. There is very little point in coming up with explanations until company officials decide to share the real reasons for this shutdown.\n\nMany people in the Bitcoin community feel Keza had a lot of potential to become a Bitcoin killer app, which would put the cryptocurrency ecosystem on the map. From what we can tell, all beta testers have had their bitcoins refunded to them without going through a reimbursement process.\n\nSource: Keza\n\nHeader image courtesy of Keza', 'Jalak Jobanputra is founding partner of Future/Perfect Ventures, an early-stage venture capital fund in NYC.\n\nIn this piece, Jobanputra looks forward to the ways consumers might use blockchain in the future, while identifying three areas where its impact might be most immediately felt.\n\nOnce every 20 years or so, new technology comes to market that has the potential to change how we communicate, how we do business, and pushes the boundaries of everything we thought was possible.\n\nIn the 1970s, it was the personal computer; in the mid-1990s, the commercial Internet. Now, we are in the early stages of another major technological development called the blockchain.\n\nThe ""blockchain"" is a distributed consensus system that allows transactions, or other data, to be securely stored and verified without any centralized authority. All transactions are part of a chain, verified in blocks via different nodes in the network (hence… ""the blockchain"") – through mathematical algorithms which ensure that transactions cannot be tampered with once they are recorded. The transactions are stored on a global ledger (which is why the concept is often referred to as a distributed ledger).\n\nWhile banks are currently testing out the technology for back-office functions, transactions on the blockchain don’t have to be financial; the data being transmitted doesn’t have to be money.\n\nThe system only needs a token (right now, bitcoin is the most popular one) that can carry transaction data through the network, and an incentive system in place to reward the nodes (right now, ""miners"") for utilizing their computing power to verify transactions.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThe graphics below display how I\'m thinking about this technology fitting into a more general shift we are seeing from unconnected computing (personal computers), to distributed client/server/cloud computing (the era we are in now), to a peer-to-peer, decentralized model where machines, people and companies are directly connected without being routed through a central server or intermediaries.\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) cannot happen without peer-to-peer connections that can offload transactions from a single central pipe. Gartner forecasts 25 billion new sensors will be deployed between now and the end of this decade – many of these will require machine-to-machine microtransactions, involving data, software updates and potentially ""smart contracts"" (events that occur if something else happens – i.e., release of money from an account if a solar panel is utilized).\n\nThree components of these transactions are interesting:\n\nThey are micropayments enabling a larger number of friction-free transactions The amount of data created by this decentralized network will be staggering, and thus technologies such machine learning and cognitive computing become more important Due to lower transaction costs, more people around the world will have access to goods and services that were previously out of reach.\n\nFurthermore, data now truly becomes currency, and we will be able to transact with disparate data – akin to a ""digital barter"" system. Even more exciting, this new currency will be programmable – a concept which is now referred to as smart contracts.\n\nYou could look at our cell phones as nodes.\n\nIn the Internet of Things, a refrigerator can be a node. My smart watch can be a node, and I can also be a node. That\'s where I think the blockchain and identity become interesting for individuals. We carry all this information with us. The global ledger could allow every one of us to store our own data in a highly secure ""vault"".\n\nWe then will be able to decide which pieces of data we want to transact with. For example, right now every time we go to a new doctor’s office we have to write down all of our medical history. Imagine if your medical history, medications, and surgeries were all discrete pieces of data on a blockchain.\n\nThen, you would be able to authenticate and send the data you wanted to transfer to different parties – whether it’s a new doctor, an insurance company, a research study or a relative. You would also have the security of knowing that the data could not be hacked (large health insurance company databases are a target for hackers, as health records command a premium on illicit sites).\n\nLet’s look at three other ways we may use this technology in the future:\n\nFinance\n\nWhen assets exchange hands, it’s difficult to prove who owns what, especially when transactions are happening quickly.\n\nThis leads to outright failures in the system from improper accounting (similar to what happened to banks in 2008, when so many assets traded so quickly that no one could track the underlying integrity of those assets), or a need for a large amount of reserves, which ties up capital and makes it expensive for all of us to do business. Blockchain technology can address this.\n\nThe ledger records who owns what, and allows anyone access (with proper provisioning) to that one global database.\n\nA bank or buyer can digitally ask the blockchain to make sure the other party owns what she says she does. This can happen near instantaneously. Now we will not have to pay extra overhead costs for all the people that double check records, and banks should theoretically charge lower fees.\n\nThink about the billions of people around the world who don’t have bank accounts. When we apply for a loan in the US, we are assessed on our prior recorded financial history, and whether we have proven that we can responsibly pay back our lenders.\n\nOver 2.5 billion people in the world are unbanked with no recorded financial history, a fact that severely restricts whether they are able to pay for their children’s education, expand their livelihood, or get through a rough crop year in the case of farmers.\n\nImagine if you could verify that person’s identity, their trustworthiness through a verified record that cannot be tampered with.\n\nThink of the economic opportunity that will open up for individuals and businesses if they are able to access financial services such as savings accounts and loans. You would be more likely to do business with them if you could assess the true risk of lending to, or transacting with, them.\n\nReal Estate\n\nThe average individual in the US will move 11 times in her lifetime.\n\nMost buyers and sellers make use of escrow and title companies for third-party verification – to reduce risk of fraud (forgery of documents) and ensure the deal will go through. This escrow fee can be 1-2% of a home\'s value.\n\nTitle insurance is also huge industry: Read this eye-opening article documenting how ""title insurance in the US emerged in the 1870s as a way to protect buyers from dubious real estate deals"", and now the sector “enjoys a loss ratio of just 7% – for every $100 collected in premiums, it pays out just $7 in claims"".\n\nBy using the blockchain, to prove ownership, homeowners can transfer ownership without large fees.\n\nA home’s data could also be on the blockchain – all repairs, chain of ownership, history of electricity, etc. – providing an immutable record of ownership so that a potential buyer has all information related to that home.\n\nThe more information a seller makes available the better price she may be able to negotiate for that transaction. This transparency and efficient market can create value for both the seller and buyer and can also incentivize owners to take better care of assets.\n\nArt\n\nThe art market is one of the largest unregulated markets in the world.\n\nTens of millions of dollars are often transferred with little documentation. The current system makes it difficult to track the history of a piece of art, otherwise known as a work\'s provenance.\n\nAs a global public ledger, the blockchain can add more transparency in this market – every piece of art can be registered on the ledger and each exchange of the artwork, along with the value of that exchange, can be recorded.\n\nForgeries will not be possible, as the artwork’s initial authentication will serve as the immutable record. Right now, so much of art’s value is determined by a small group – the blockchain can remove this subjectivity as well as allow greater access to art as an investment for a larger number of people.\n\nThe Future\n\nThese examples are just a starting point. Just as we never envisioned a world where we would carry around fully connected supercomputers (smartphones) in our pockets a mere 20 years ago, we can’t even imagine all of the applications of the blockchain today.\n\nBut the fact that companies like Goldman Sachs, IBM, Cisco and institutions including the World Economic Forum, International Monetary Fund and Bank of England are experimenting with the technology, shows that this is not a flash in the pan concept. It is here to stay.\n\nA blockchain-enabled world will be one that creates trust between transacting parties without the need to know them personally.\n\nThis is why the concept is often referred to as “trustless trust”. Our current system uses checks and balances at a cost to each of us. A blockchain world will not only allow faster, cheaper and truly global transactions, but will also allow each of us to control and track the distribution of our own data.\n\nThe combination of blockchain technology, machine learning, and development of relevant applications, can unlock unprecedented economic opportunity throughout the world.\n\nBall and chain image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

04/24/2016,"[""Lots of us are struggling to wrap our minds around that word “bitcoin.” We’re not quite sure what it is and why it’s a big deal, or if it’s just a scam. It’s not a scam, but it is still evolving, and probably not quite ready for primetime. That’s because it’s still volatile—there’s so little of it in use that it doesn’t take much to jerk the value of each bitcoin up and down—and because using bitcoin requires more effort right now than most people want to bother with. But if you still want want a simple explanation: Bitcoin is cash for the online world.\n\nThis article is not about bitcoin.\n\nWhat it is about is the verification system that enables bitcoin: It’s called the “blockchain.” It embodies—if one can use that word for the disembodied virtual world—a concept that has a profound potential to change our lives. While bitcoin already uses a blockchain, it’s likely many more things will in the future. It’s such a cool concept.\n\nWhat the BlockChain Is\n\nA blockchain is a large digital record made out of a chain of digital data blocks. It’s shared by 8,000 to 9,000 computers around the world, so there’s no single master copy of it. It exists as all of those identical copies on all those computers. Since nobody owns the blockchain—such as a government that could change hands or a private business that could fail—it’s unusually safe from tampering, accidental loss or mishap.\n\nThe blockchain can’t be changed. It can only be added to. This ensures that all of the information it’s ever contained can’t be deleted.\n\nBefore a new chunk of information—a new data block—is added, all of the 8,000 to 9,000 computers holding the blockchain have to approve its validity. They do this only after they receive the requisite cryptographic and mathematical proof baked into the new block. (This is what puts the “crypto” in “cryptocurrency.) The process occurs automatically, requiring no human interaction or control, and typically takes just a few minutes.\n\n“Reliable,” “permanent.” Not words we’re used to in the online world. But the distributed nature of the blockchain and the strength of the cryptography make sabotaging the blockchain unusually tough for would-be hackers or terrorists. (Cough, cough: digital banking records.) And the system’s continually being strengthened.\n\nThe blockchain community is currently prioritizing scalability—the bitcoin system’s still a bit slow—and locking down privacy. Given the permanence of the blockchain's record, there’s a lot of info to, well, hide.\n\nAlso, there's a debate raging within the community about whether there should be multiple blockchains for different uses, or one for everything. We're not taking sides.\n\nWhat’s All This About Earth-Shaking Potential?\n\nSo think of a chain block as a trustworthy, automated information record that requires no manager. With that in mind, there are lots of possibilities. Here are just a few.\n\nBlockchain Financial Records\n\nWe alluded to this before. We’re talking banks and stock brokers and such. Right now, all of our “money” exists mostly as digital numbers in digital ledgers somewhere in some company’s records. How secure is it? Who knows? What happens to our personal worth in the event of malevolent hacker, bomb, or a strategically placed electromagnetic pulse?\n\nNow imagine a world where a bank or brokerage doesn’t own this data and it’s stored in a decentralized, secure public blockchain.\n\nWith a blockchain, there would also be no need for third-party middlemen such as credit card companies or banks between you and vendors. Oooh.\n\nBlockchain Personal authentication\n\nAside from being a complete pain trying to remember them all, passwords have proven to be a pretty insecure ID method.\n\nA personal ID from a blockchain would be ironclad, and could be used in lots of ways. Signing documents digitally, voting, turning car- and home-alarms on and off, and traveling across borders are all things that immediately come to mind. Yes, I said “voting.” No voter fraud would be possible.\n\nBlockchain Business authentication\n\nAre those real Nikes you just bought? What if genuine products were tagged in such a way that they could be authenticated via an app before you plunked your $$ down?\n\nBlockchain Property Records\n\nReal estate records are notoriously unreliable, dependent as they are on local municipalities’ unpredictable record-keeping. A centralized real-estate property blockchain could solve this. This is especially an issue in the Third World, where a lack of clarity about who owns what has significantly hampered development.\n\nBlockchain Law\n\nBlockchain-linked apps could more accurately and inexpensively perform tasks that are now done by bankers, lawyers, registrars and administrators.\n\nThat’s not all. The current legal system offers protections that only the wealthy can afford to prosecute. “Smart” contracts with conditions tied to a blockchain would allow the automatic execution of obligations, avoiding disputes and making for fewer instances in which you need money to get justice.\n\nBlockchain Cloud Computing\n\nWouldn’t it obviously be far more secure to store cloud data in a blockchain than a single fallible company’s equally fallible handful of servers? Not to mention the company would no longer have access to your data.\n\nActually, you could just compute in the cloud altogether, with a blockchain securely holding your data. There’s already a company developing a blockchain OS.\n\nMessaging Apps\n\nA blockchain-based messaging platform could handle user verification and connection instead of, say, Facebook, allowing you to chat with friends without a company having access to your conversation?\n\n”In Proof We Trust”\n\nThat’s the slogan of people who use bitcoin, and it reveals the underlying belief in complex cryptographic keys as the only reliable way to trust something electronic. Staying ahead of hackers and advancing technology is a never-ending race, with blockchain experts are already pondering how to maintain the system’s integrity in the face of proposed quantum computers. It’s not a perfectly worked-out system yet, but the blockchain is an incredibly promising concept that may well stand behind much of what we trust in years to come."", 'Police arrested Michael Murgio in Palm Beach, Fla. for participating in a scheme to pay bribes to allow the Coin.mx bitcoin exchange gain control of a New Jersey credit union, according to Fortune.

Of course, one of the simplest, but nonetheless effective, means of ascertaining who uses bitcoin is to analyze Google Trends, as we find in Yelowitz and Wilson (2015).\n\nAlthough an imperfect method, since ""search query need not imply active participation"", Yelowitz and Wilson identify four types of broad bitcoin users: computer programming enthusiasts, speculative investors, libertarians and criminals (2015, pg 1030).\n\nThis very much fits the ""expected"" profile of bitcoin users, and it also closely fits the results of a 2013 survey of 1,000 bitcoin users that found ""the average user is a 32-year-old libertarian male"".\n\n(Full disclosure: I am a 32-year-old male, but not a libertarian as such).\n\nFrom the perspective of these four types, the major reasons for bitcoin\'s appeal are:\n\nFor computer programmers, the rewards for mining\n\nFor speculators, the volatility\n\nFor the libertarians, the perceived lack of regulation\n\nFor criminals, the perceived anonymity.\n\nLibertarians are well-represented in bitcoin\'s non-academic literature, with themes concerning the potential of the technology to alter the prevalent social and economic orders (eg Kelly, 2015; Casey and Vigna, 2015).\n\nBooks aimed at speculators, as one might expect, focus on bitcoin’s potential as an investment (Wilcox, 2014). Computer programmers enthusiasts are well-served by Swan (2015) and Antonopoulos (2015). The former is very blockchain-focused while the latter, true to form, is bitcoin-focused.\n\nCriminal elements\n\nAnother prominent community, criminals came to be associated with bitcoin via the story of the Silk Road marketplace.\n\nSilk Road was an online marketplace operating on what is known variously as the Dark Web, the Dark Net or, erroneously, the Deep Web. The latter covers all the parts of the web that search engines do not index, but the ""dark"" aspect refers to sites that feature user anonymity and are, by default, difficult to access. Unsurprisingly, these markets are popular among this subset (Bartlett, 2014).\n\nIn terms of scale, for the criminal vector, the classic study by Christin (2013) of Silk Road put the revenue numbers in an eight-month period in 2011–2012 to roughly $1.2m, with $92,000 going to the operators of the marketplace.\n\nNow, the above description tends to relate to what one might term the generic bitcoin community, meaning they are the people who either mine, buy, trade or use bitcoin routinely (or are committed hoarders with an eye toward using it as a store of value).\n\nEven if bitcoin is arguably not a currency, as some claim, it is treated as such by this community.\n\nDifferent definitions\n\nWhen it comes to trying to understand what bitcoin is, we often find that arguments center upon its status as a currency as understood in regulatory, financial or legal terms. Currency is one way to grasp bitcoin, albeit one related to questions about how the digital currency might come to fit into mainstream society.\n\nBitcoin users often seem conflicted on the issue. On the one hand, they want bitcoin to be different than what has come before, but they also, for various reasons, want to see more people using it.\n\nThis conflict helps explain why the community nearly split over the scaling debate, but from a different angle. Miners, for instance, were drawn to BIP 100 (introduced by developer Jeff Garzik) for a few technical reasons, but one social one is that it allows the miners to become active voters on the future of the Bitcoin Core reference client.\n\nSome speculators support Bitcoin Classic because it means faster transactions that speak to this entrepreneurial spirit that wants bitcoin adoption to grow significantly faster.\n\nLibertarians are caught somewhere in the middle. They don’t want the miners to become too centralized, but also seem tuned into the fact that the Bitcoin Core development community could be seen as a centralized structure, too.\n\nThey also might want wider adoption for ideological reasons, but also want to avoid a major screw-up in the form of a disastrous hard fork that could imperil the network\'s future.\n\nCriminals will carry on as they always have, but are largely outside of the mainstream conversation at present.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nBitcoin users are, then, precisely what one would expect on paper: technically literate, politically plugged-in and economically motivated.\n\nHowever, one must remember that just become someone is a libertarian, this does not translate into automatic sympathy to dark net criminals. Nor is there a clean path for the libertarian when it comes to decentralization: for the traditional technologically-focused decentralist this means disavowing large block-increases just to facilitate faster transactions.\n\nTo the more economically-minded, decentralization means no block limit at all, and thus wider adoption of bitcoin for commercial uses.\n\nWhat the scaling debate has revealed is that there is no homogenous community of Bitcoin ""types"" per se, but rather various factions united under the umbrella term of decentralization.\n\nDiverse business crowd via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

When it comes to adoption and future of this digital currency, bitcoin is readily comparable to the origins and growth of the internet itself. It is the human nature to fiercely resist change before embracing it, and being a revolutionary development, bitcoin is still facing the resistance phase.\n\nBitcoin and its underlying technology have introduced a completely new monetary system which no one would have imagined to be possible before it. Bitcoin is an open source, distributed digital currency that works without the involvement of a bank or any other institution as a trusted third party. This allows individuals to have more control over their money without worrying about the banks or the government dictating terms. These very characteristics of bitcoin are being blamed by some, for supposedly encouraging money laundering, tax evasion, and for its use on the deep web. However, bitcoin has got a lot more to offer than what has been discussed about so fat in the media.\n\nBitcoin is the first open payment system the world has ever seen. Even though it is still new, it is growing and will continue to grow big until it creates a huge impact, just like the internet. Being an open source system makes it easier for developers and enthusiast to build upon the existing system, making it much better than it already is.\n\nThere are plenty of companies offering bitcoin exchange, trading and payment services. Most of them have seen a lot of changes in the behavior of their users in the recent days. The change in user behavior has a direct co-relation with bitcoin’s value as well. According to media reports, the number of speculative bitcoin users has gone down. More and more people are increasingly using bitcoin as a payment network than a speculative financial asset. This change in user behavior has no only led to the growth of the network but also reduced price volatility.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin is being used mainly for remittance, payouts for freelancers, contractors, and other regular payments. As its adoption grows, many companies like DELL, Overstock, Expedia and others have already started accepting bitcoin payments on their sites.\n\nIn a recent interview, the CEO and founder of Coinbase Brian Armstrong has stated that bitcoin and blockchain technology are not as separable as some presume. They are both part of the same thing, and unless more innovation goes into the public blockchain and bitcoin, private blockchains and integration of the technology into the banking sector will not make much difference.\n\nThere have been multiple reports of bitcoin being a failure, but according to Brian Armstrong these developers haven’t been patient enough to wait for things to happen. Also, it is not new for bitcoin to have people wrongly predict its impending demise. These predictions are so frequent that there is a website called Bitcoin Obituaries to keep track of them.\n\nThe advantages of bitcoin are unparalleled and those who are talking about the demise of bitcoin in the near future are doing so with no more than a couple of points to support their hypothesis.\n\nRef: The Mercury News | Image: Make Big Money - Great Beyond Disclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC', ""Overstock’s Farmers Market service connects organic, local farms with customers, allowing their products to be sold for Bitcoin - without even knowing it.\n\nAside from the occasional creative Russian farmer or underground market in New Hampshire, the average agricultural worker is not that well-versed in fintech, and as such few are likely to accept Bitcoin for their products.

In a time when huge retailers, especially online retailers, are constantly running traditional retailers into the ground, Patrick has made it clear that he likes the idea of using our technology to support foundational entrepreneurism. We have projects like WorldStock and Main Street Revolution that exist only to help artisans overseas and in the US to access broader markets through our technology.”\n\nAs Bagley puts it, farmers in particular represent the core of entrepreneurism, and as such were worth taking a business risk in a partnership possibly ahead of its time.\n\n“We see farmers as the most foundational entrepreneurs in existence. Patrick decided to find a way to use the Overstock.com shopping platform to help small farmers reach larger markets – though always remaining local – in 2013 and we launched Farmers Market in 2014. It’s been slow going for a while because the idea is so foreign to everybody involved, from the farmers themselves to consumers and everybody in between. But adoption is picking up and we’re pleased with how things are going.”\n\nFarmers not particularly tech-savvy\n\nBagley estimates most farmers’ technical know-how to be “...about average.”\n\n“Which means they get and use the internet all the time, but are not necessarily ready to deal with inventory management. We've built our interface with that in mind. And they do very well with it.”\n\nHe also thinks that few farmers would even be aware that they could accept Bitcoin for their products through Overstock.\n\n“Shopping with Bitcoin represents a pretty small portion of all purchases on the site, as does shopping on the Farmers Market. So shopping with Bitcoin on the Farmers Market is almost negligible. If more knew this were an option, I'm sure the numbers would jump up. People who are passionate about the “eat local” movement tend to be the same kinds of people who are passionate about the cryptocurrency movement. So the two are natural allies.”\n\nUsing Overstock to broaden the customer base\n\nAccording to Gita Murphy of Arizona-based Double Check Ranch, Overstock’s Farmers Market service extended the reach of their products.\n\n“We decided to start selling through Overstock to be able to broaden our customer base - prior to this, we could only sell our product locally in Tucson/Phoenix area Farmers' Markets weekly. We have customers who've moved out of state and would still like to buy from us - or, customers who live here and would love for their friends and family to be able to try us, too. And of course, for those who can't physically make it to our markets this gives them the option to have it shipped directly.”\n\nMurphy was not aware of Overstock even accepting Bitcoin for payments, and as such was surprised at the ability to buy products from Double Check Ranch using cryptocurrency."", 'Ethereum is now the second largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin in terms of market cap. It dislodged Litecoin from its previous position to take up the top spot among altcoins.\n\nAs the demand for Ether, the cryptocurrency used by Ethereum protocol increases, there are a lot of questions about its future and comparison with other digital currencies floating around. If we have to compare Ethereum with Litecoin, one can find few similarities and enough differences. What makes this discussion even more important is the recent news about Litecoin being added alongside bitcoin and ether on Shapeshift. Earlier last week, the Erik Voorhees led crypto-crypto exchange recovering from the hacking attempts made this announcement about the inclusion of new cryptocurrency into the platform.\n\nLitecoin is an alternate to bitcoin created by Charles Lee, the brother of Bobby Lee, the founder of BTCC. Litecoin was created as a fork of the Bitcoin-QT client. Litecoin was created with the intention of improving certain flaws of bitcoin by decreasing the block generation time, increasing the maximum number of cryptocoin that can be mined and more. The digital currency also used a different variant of hashing algorithm called Scrypt, which is a proof of work protocol. Even though the use of Scrypt was to prevent the use of FPGA and ASIC miners for mining Litecoin, it failed as it is now quite possible to mine Litecoin with dedicated equipment.\n\nWhile Litecoin was created as an alternative for Bitcoin, Ethereum protocol was created as a blockchain-based applications protocol. Blockchain-based applications are smart contracts programmed over the blockchain, these smart contracts can be executed automatically once the preprogrammed conditions for its execution are satisfied. Ethereum uses Ether as a crypto token for value exchange on the platform. In addition, the Ethereum protocol currently running on Ethash proof of work protocol will soon be migrating to proof of stake system called Casper. Once Proof of Stake algorithm is initiated, it will be virtually impossible to use dedicated hardware to accelerate mining. It is very important in this case as Ethereum uses the processing power to run decentralized applications on the network and not just for the discovery of new blocks so that the miners a get their rewards, sooner than later.\n\nThe market capitalization of Ethereum is bound to grow compared to that of Litecoin for various reasons. Litecoin is an alternative peer to peer payment protocol whereas Ethereum is a smart contracts platform which has more applications in the real world than just executing payments. As the adoption of Ethereum protocol for various blockchain applications involving banking and fintech sectors increase, the value and market capitalization are bound to increase as well.\n\nBitcoin still leads the way as a digital currency for peer-to-peer transactions and fund transfers. Ethereum and Ripple are second and third in line when it comes to market capitalization. Litecoin is currently in the fourth place and as of now, it may continue to maintain the position for some more time before getting an opportunity to climb the ranks.\n\nRef: CoinMarketCap | Ethereum Guide | Image: Modern Cash 3 - Zach Copley\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'John Biggs is CEO of stealth bitcoin startup Freemit and a former editor at TechCrunch. His work has appeared in publications such as The New York Times, Gizmodo and Men\'s Health.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Biggs takes aim at out-of-touch banks and timid FinTech investors for what he argues is the way they are disrupting innovation to the detriment of consumers.\n\nIn speaking with FinTech investors and the companies they’ve supported, I’ve found one thing to be true: FinTech in the US is an incremental game of kick-the-can populated by entrepreneurs who are incessantly stymied by frightened bankers and investors.\n\nIf there is any one place ripe for disruption, it is the milquetoast world of financial technology.\n\nIn building Freemit, we met countless entrepreneurs who walked a similar path. They wanted to change the way something worked in an implicit way, whether it was through a new way to manage payments, a new way to send money or a new way to create contracts.\n\nThese entrepreneurs had pedigrees far beyond what is expected of the average team building the latest Silicon Valley darling, and they were aware of the limitations of FinTech and the perils that awaited them.\n\nWhen we began our process, we were told again and again that the road would be hard and we would be stopped at every turn.\n\nThis is absolutely true and endlessly frustrating. The US FinTech space is timid, timorous and inbred, and the room for disruption is defined by how best to wedge yourself into existing scams.\n\nThankless task\n\nInnovation in US FinTech is not rewarded. It is considered suspect.\n\nAnything that upsets one person in a big bank is immediately scrapped. Ideas are neutered and spayed with abandon and all that’s left are ""software solutions"" that entrepreneurs hope to sell for a few million a year to an IT director who didn’t say ""No"" that day.\n\nThe result? The winners are me-too widgets that make one trader’s life better in one building in one office on Wall Street. Entrepreneurs essentially give up and fall back to status-quo ideas that are software-only and perhaps make trading easier.\n\nIn short, they abandon real innovation in order to kowtow to the banks, regulators, and whoever else is having a bad day because their golf game was interrupted by a server fault.\n\nSure, there are folks out there trying mightily to change the way things work, but they are not being rewarded. Sit down and talk with some old-guard financial types and you will see that improvements to their creaking ships are unwanted and seen as too difficult or frightening to implement.\n\nAmazing ideas – ideas that will pull the banking industry out of the coming doldrums – are suspect.\n\nAbandon ship\n\nMake no mistake – the banking industry is in trouble, and millennials want no part of the old regime.\n\n""They have their own tools and their own rules, and the traditional legacy scheme that we\'ve set up for doing things in certain institutional sectors doesn’t really matter to them,"" said Donna Sabino, senior vice president at Ipsos MediaCT, in a recent Forbes article.\n\nThe report goes on to note that Millennials can expect a $41tn wealth transfer ""through mid-century"".\n\n""Their financial behaviors have the potential to redefine financial services and transform how financial services companies interact with their customers,"" writes Laura Shin.\n\nTo some degree, the improvement over the status quo can be as simple as slapping a prettier face on an old system. But even this is fraught with backwards thinking. I mentioned chatbots to a Chase executive who said they already had chat in place. He meant a way to request your balance via text message.\n\nWho is doing it right? The only (former) US person I can think of off-hand is Erik Voorhees, who abandoned the US entirely and holds no customer money.\n\nBy playing it completely safe – no regulator can touch his business even though they’d love to – he has proven that there is no benefit to incorporating a FinTech company in the US. He is even transparent about being hacked. Considering the average bank would only admit defeat months after an attack, his is a bold path.\n\nFolly of \'blockchain\'\n\nHow can US FinTech survive?\n\nPrimarily through acceptance of some risk as well as by embracing new technologies on the terms of those technologies. And that doesn’t mean co-opting the tech and paying lip service to its value.\n\n""They started with denial,"" said technologist Andreas Antonopoulos. ""\'Heh, Bitcoin. Go play you little hackers.\' Then they noticed it wasn’t going away. So they started getting angry. \'Err, Bitcoin… Criminals! Pedophiles! Terrorists! The world will end if we allow normal people to control their own money.\'""\n\nFurther, pretending to support innovation is silly.\n\n""\'So that nice open, decentralized, borderless, peer-to-peer, open-innovation, open-access system you built,\'"" said Antonopoulos. ""\'Well, we can build one that is not open, not decentralized, not borderless, not open-innovation, and not open-access that we control completely… blockchain!\' And they’re missing the point.""\n\nNo one will deny that the stewardship of great wealth is a frightening responsibility.\n\nBut by abandoning innovation for safety, that stewardship is done in half measures. Like the parable of the three servants to which the master has given out money, we find that Europe and Asia are the first two servants and the US is the third.\n\nThe two wise servants invest the master\'s money and make the master a great profit. The foolish servant buries it and returns with nothing more than the perception of security.\n\nThat this is the case is a true shame and leaves the US in the dust – to the benefit of every other region in the world.\n\nHandshake buzzer image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Mexican mobile payments platform Saldo.mx allows to pay for their loved ones’ utility bills across borders. Saldo recently debuted a microinsurance service, Consuelo, to allow users to easily use a fixed health and life insurance policy.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke with Marco Montes Neri, founder of Saldo, about the company’s blockchain-powered microinsurance initiative.\n\nCoinTelegraph: What prompted Saldo to start dealing in microinsurance?\n\nMarco Montes Neri: Insurance in general has been always a very important thing for me and has the potential to reallocate the risk and create a better world. Insurance is broken and we have been thinking about a new model, something like non-adjustable insurance rather than micro insurance that may sound like cheap.\n\nMicroinsurance is more similar to what we think in the future with smart contracts will cover people from risks. What is interesting about this form of insurance is the removal of the middle man, the claim adjuster, and the society has evolved in such a way that has created authorities that with a very good level of certainty act as oracle that determine if something has happened or not. So combining those oracles and a blockchain that guarantees integrity of data of those who decided to cover themselves from some risks creates for the very first time powerful, non-adjustable coverage that we are now including as part of the Saldo offering.\n\nCommon timeline is crucial\n\nCT: How does using a blockchain simplify this process?\n\nMMN: The blockchain acts as verifiable data history. It’s the very first time financial world has something like that in a mutualized way. It’s a common timeline that in this industry will be crucial.\n\nCT: Does the average intended user understand anything about blockchain technology?\n\nMMN: Not at all, this is used only to make efficient the chain: Insurance company- broker - dealer. Users will only perceive simpler products, which is good for adoption.\n\nCT: Do you foresee potential users as being reluctant to try out an insurance platform so simple, easy, and efficient without fully understanding why it is that way?\n\nMMN: Sure, there are a lot of problems because people relate the word insurance with bureaucratic and complicated things. That is why we call this Consuelo, the spanish word for consolation. We need to do what insurers have been doing poorly over years, which is communicate how powerful a mechanism it is to have some money available in rainy days.\n\nCommunity outreach\n\nCT: Other Mexican Bitcoin companies have mentioned community outreach and education initiatives to grow the pool of potential customers. Is Saldo active in educating people about the benefits of using blockchain technology?\n\nMMN: We are very active educating underbanked communities We even work with the Mexican foreign ministry in financial literacy events. But still, to specifically talk about the blockchain is too complex. That is why we decided to start educating financial institutions first. They are more familiar with the problems that blockchain solves like counterparty risk, or lack of trust.\n\nCT: Where do you see most of your customer base: in Mexico itself, or immigrants in the US?\n\nMMN: We are focused on the diaspora first as there are millions exposed to all sort of risks, but one of our products covers both: if the US immigrant dies, the family member in Mexico gets the “Consuelo,” and the other way around. So I’d say we have a community without borders approach.', 'The lightning Network is a pure proof-of-stake system, but it will be based on the Bitcoin network in a trustless manner, and guaranteed by Bitcoin’s proof-of-work.\n\nTo quite some people, the connection between creativity and financial freedom has remained invisible for quite some time now. But Andreas Antonopoulos pointed out how there is a distinct correlation between creativity and what fine-grained components have to offer.\n\nAlso read: Blockchain Disruption Will Affect Every Aspect of Daily Life\n\nAndreas Antonopoulos: “Bitcoin Has A Lot of Exciting New Features.”\n\nOne of the more prominent very few people are aware of is how Bitcoin will have a hybrid Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake system in the near future. This is a creative decision by the developers very few people had envisioned up until now, and it will effectively turn the entire Bitcoin ecosystem on its head.\n\nA lot of people were shocked when Andreas Antonopoulos made this announcement during a Bitcoin Berlin meetup. The Lightning Network, which is scheduled for launch later this year, is based on proof-of-take. However, it does not operate like people envision this system in the altcoin scene, as the Lightning Network is an entirely different creature.\n\nPeople have to understand the Lightning Network uses a concept that requires money to be committed to a multisignature address. More money increases the number of transactions to be handled, which will generate new fees. This is a real proof-of-stake system, but it will be based on the Bitcoin network in a trustless manner, and guaranteed by Bitcoin’s proof-of-work.\n\nThe consensus algorithms of the future may benefit from proof-of-stake according to Antonopoulos, as this solution would allow for further scalability than the proof-of-work technology is capable of right now. This is just one of the many surprises Bitcoin users can expect in the coming years as creativity is being stimulated by the open source nature of this Bitcoin concept, and its open nature welcomes all kinds of different ideas.\n\nThe design of Bitcoin is another area where lots of innovation and creativity will be stimulated over the coming years. But the design of Bitcoin goes well beyond what the users see, as the concept behind cryptocurrency is completely new and different while creating an entirely new ecosystem which can be explained through metaphors linking to existing financial paradigms.\n\nUp until this point, the efforts to explain Bitcoin through design have failed utterly, Antonopoulos stated. Even the name Bitcoin is not helping matters much, as the cryptocurrency is very different from coins, and the term “Bit” is not attracting too many people either. Moreover, the concept of a Bitcoin “wallet” is not helping matters much either, as it does not highlight this disruptive model Bitcoin actually represents.\n\nExciting times are ahead for the Bitcoin ecosystem in the coming years. Unlike traditional finance, the Bitcoin world will keep on innovating several times per year, whereas the concept of money has only evolved five times within the past two million years. There are many advantages to Bitcoin over the traditional financial world, as people get paid regardless of where they are or what type of work they do. Albeit that may not sound all that appealing to people who have never experienced issues when dealing with international clients, it makes a world of difference for anyone who takes their financial status seriously.\n\nSource: Youtube\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"
04/25/2016,"['Fifteen months ago, hackers lifted more than $5 million from the bitcoin exchange operated by Bitstamp, a Slovenian company that aspired to push the digital currency across Western Europe. The hack wasn\'t nearly as large or as devastating as the one that pilfered $460 million from Mt. Gox and sent the Japan-based exchange, then one of the world\'s largest, spiraling into bankruptcy. But it was yet another black eye for bitcoin, the digital currency that holds so much promise as an alternative to fiat currencies but has never really broken into the mainstream.\n\nIn small ways, however, bitcoin is climbing back towards respectability. This morning, Bitstamp announced that it has received a license from the Luxembourg Ministry of Finance to operate as a payment institution, and according to the company, this license applies to the European Union as a whole. ""With this,"" says Dan Morehead, the chairman of Bitstamp and the CEO of Pantera Capital, a firm that specializes in investments related to bitcoin, ""Bitstamp is able to do business in all 28 countries of the EU.""\n\nAccording to Jean-Louis Schiltz, a Luxembourg-based lawyer who helped Bitstamp secure the license, it\'s the first bitcoin exchange to gain such approval in the EU. The news follows similar regulatory progress for bitcoin companies in the U.S. In October, Gemini, the exchange operated by Facebook nemesi Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, received approval to operate in the state of New York through what\'s called a limited liability trust charter, and a few months before that, the state granted a similar charter to a third exchange, itBit. Meanwhile, the state has granted one of its new BitLicenses to online wallet company Circle.\n\nIn the US, bitcoin regulation still happens largely on a state-by-state business, with most companies operating under ordinary money transmitter licenses. But New York is pushing towards a more formal approach that\'s specific to bitcoin and other digital currencies. And BitStamp has provided a blueprint for other companies to gain regulatory approval across the EU. ""I believe that others will follow relatively quickly,"" says Bitstamp CEO and founder Nejc Kondri?. ""They have an easier task.""\n\nAll this may provide more peace of mind for businesses and consumers that use these various bitcoin services. But in the US and across Europe, bitcoin is still a solution looking for a problem. In the developing world, the digital currency can provide a much needed way of more easily spending and moving money, particularly across borders. But within developing countries, spending and moving money isn\'t all that difficult.\n\nUltimately, something like bitcoin could help provide all of us a global network for sending money across the Internet as easily as we send emails and texts. But that\'s a long way off. Since Mt Gox imploded in early 2014, bitcoin has faced a perception problem. In turn, this probably slowed down regulatory process in so many parts of the world. And that has helped keep the digital currency well outside the mainstream.\n\nBitstamp started working for its Luxembourg license about two years ago, after failing to receive similar approval in the United Kingdom. And the company acknowledges that the hack didn\'t help. ""With that happening during the [regulatory] process,"" Kondri? says, ""it does bring extra scrutiny to our IT security.""', 'This story was delivered to BI Intelligence ""Fintech Briefing"" subscribers.

The CEO said that Bitcoin\'s growing popularity was akin to a ""gold rush,"" that ""real people"" are not using it, and it doesn\'t even solve any problems in the first place.\n\nThe grain of salt to take with Hinrikus\' remarks is that Transferwise is in competition with several Bitcoin firms. Circle, which just obtained a U.K. operating license, facilitates money transfers by turning currency into Bitcoins and then converting them back into fiat currency after the transfer completes.\n\nThese Bitcoin transactions depend on the distributed computing power of the network\'s users rather than a central body such as a clearinghouse, so they ultimately cost less because there is no middleman that needs to receive payment.\n\nTransferWise was valued at $1 billion last year, at which time money transfer and fintech firms represented the second-largest share of fintech funding backed by venture capital in the U.K. at 19%, or $243 million.\n\nTime will tell if Hinrikus is correct, but what is inarguable is that we’ve entered the most profound era of change for financial services companies since the 1970s brought us index mutual funds, discount brokers and ATMs.\n\nNo firm is immune from the coming disruption and every company must have a strategy to harness the powerful advantages of the new fintech revolution.\n\nThe battle already underway will create surprising winners and stunned losers among some of the most powerful names in the financial world: The most contentious conflicts (and partnerships) will be between startups that are completely reengineering decades-old practices, traditional power players who are furiously trying to adapt with their own innovations, and total disruption of established technology & processes:\n\nTraditional Retail Banks vs. Online-Only Banks: Traditional retail banks provide a valuable service, but online-only banks can offer many of the same services with higher rates and lower fees\n\nTraditional Lenders vs. Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces : P2P lending marketplaces are growing much faster than traditional lenders—only time will tell if the banks strategy of creating their own small loan networks will be successful\n\nTraditional Asset Managers vs. Robo-Advisors : Robo-advisors like Betterment offer lower fees, lower minimums and solid returns to investors, but the much larger traditional asset managers are creating their own robo-products while providing the kind of handholding that high net worth clients are willing to pay handsomely for.\n\nAs you can see, this very fluid environment is creating winners and losers before your eyes…and it’s also creating the potential for new cost savings or growth opportunities for both you and your company.\n\nAfter months of researching and reporting this important trend, Evan Bakker, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider\'s premium research service, has put together an essential report on the fintech ecosystem that explains the new landscape, identifies the ripest areas for disruption, and highlights the some of the most exciting new companies.

It\'s going to revolutionize everything from contracts to voting through the construction of internet applications. But, what exactly are the components of these of applications?\n\nJoel Monegro took the time to identify the most common patterns and trends that made up the architecture of bitcoin applications, which he calls the \'Blockchain Application Stack.\' This stack includes the following components;\n\n\n\nMiners and the Blockchain\n\nAs Joel reminds us, ""miners are the nodes in a network of computers who, together, verify all Bitcoin transactions. In exchange, the algorithm rewards them with Bitcoin.""\n\nBitcoin Wiki provides us with a little in-depth explanation of the process of mining and how the blockchain is involved;;\n\nMining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin\'s public ledger of past transactions. This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. The block chain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. Bitcoin nodes use the block chain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere. Mining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found each day by miners remains steady. Individual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid. This proof of work is verified by other Bitcoin nodes each time they receive a block. Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function. The primary purpose of mining is to allow Bitcoin nodes to reach a secure, tamper-resistant consensus. Mining is also the mechanism used to introduce Bitcoins into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a ""subsidy"" of newly created coins. This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized manner as well as motivating people to provide security for the system. Bitcoin mining is so called because it resembles the mining of other commodities: it requires exertion and it slowly makes new currency available at a rate that resembles the rate at which commodities like gold are mined from the ground.\n\nMining bitcoins, and it\'s alternatives, can be expensive. As we\'ve previously discussed, you\'ll have to invest in a mining system and handle transaction fees. In some cases, it may be too costly to mine coins.\n\n\n\nOverlay Networks\n\nIn its simplest definition, an overlay networks is a computer network built on top of another network. For bitcoins Joel writes, ""Developers are starting to build networks that work in parallel to the Bitcoin blockchain to perform tasks that the Bitcoin network can\'t, but that make use of the Bitcoin blockchain to, for instance, timestamp or validate their work.""\n\nSidechains, which are ""private or public networks that may or may not be based on the Bitcoin protocol,"" are an example of overlay networks. This includes exciting production sidechains like Liquid and Chromaway.\n\nMonegro adds,\n\n""Whatever form these overlay networks take, the one thing they have in common is their connection to the Bitcoin blockchain, and how they benefit from its network effects to achieve liquidity without having to bootstrap their own alternative cryptocurrency and/or blockchain like alternative solutions such as Ethereum require.""\n\nDecentralized Protocols\n\n""Thanks to the Blockchain, for the first time we can develop open source, decentralized protocols with built-in data (thanks to Overlay Networks and The Blockchain), validation, and transactions that are not controlled by a single entity."" Mongero says. The best example ""of a decentralized protocol on top of a Shared Data Layer is Bitcoin""\n\nThe potential of decentralized protocols is that they can ""undo every single part of the stacks that make these services valuable to consumers and investors."" For example, a common and decentralized data set could be created to allow for peer-to-peer-transactions that are powered by bitcoin.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Lawmakers and regulators in the United States could be doing a much better job attracting innovative fintech startups to the country, Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito said at a recent cryptocurrency-focused event hosted by the Cato Institute.\n\nAlthough the United States started out as the leader in Bitcoin regulation, it is now falling behind other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, where innovation in fintech and digital currency is being embraced with open arms.\n\nThe U.S. Has Been a Leader in Bitcoin Regulation\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. Senate held the first hearings on Bitcoin. In that same year, FinCEN released the first announcement by any government agency related to the technology. The IRS was also the first tax agency in the world to clarify the tax treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Additionally, BitLicense in New York was the first licensing regime in the world directed at digital currencies.\n\n“Although certainly imperfect, each of these pronouncements brought clarity and certainty to an emerging industry, and these approaches were copied around the world,” Brito said at the Cato event.\n\nOther Countries Are Going Further\n\nBrito also noted that the United States’ role as the regulatory leader for Bitcoin around the world is not guaranteed to last.\n\nOther countries are beginning to start regulatory regimes that don’t merely tolerate cryptocurrency firms, but welcome them with open arms, he said.\n\nBrito pointed to the United Kingdom as a specific example of a country looking to foster growth in the digital currency space:\n\n“The U.K., for example, has created a regulatory framework that bends over backward to make it easy and quick for innovative startups and entrepreneurs to comply with the appropriate consumer protection regulations and safely enter the market.”\n\nProject innovate was an initiative Brito used to bring home his point about the U.K.’s embracement of fintech. This project offers dedicated teams to startups to make sure they understand the various regulations that apply to them.\n\nOnce a business is regulated in the U.K., it’s also able to operate throughout the rest of the European Union. Brito pointed to Circle’s recent partnership with Barclays as an example of this sort of regulatory structure creating an environment for more connections between startups and the traditional banking system.\n\nIn the past, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has stated that the plan is to make London “the global center for fintech. ... The race is on, but we are determined to win it.”\n\nCurrent Status of Regulation in the U.S.\n\nSo how is the U.S. doing in comparison to the U.K.?\n\nBrito said that only one BitLicense has been issued (to Circle), and at least 27 companies are still waiting in line for approval. He also noted that efforts to offer regulatory clarity, such as digital currency legislation in California, have stalled. Brito added that Coin Center is currently working with legislators in half a dozen states on various proposals for the regulation of digital currencies.\n\nAnother key issue often brought up on the regulation of fintech firms in the United States is that a different license is required for practically every state.\n\n“Not only is this time-consuming and costly, but the states have not all explained if and how cryptocurrency businesses need to comply,” Brito said. “At the federal level, we only see the most tentative steps toward a pro-innovation agenda.”\n\nWhat Can the U.S. Do Differently?\n\nIn addition to pointing out the current issues with digital currency regulation in the United States, Brito also offered some possible solutions.\n\n“Serious action by federal banking regulators [is needed] to make it clear to banks that it’s perfectly fine ? and even encouraged ? to establish relationships with innovative fintech and digital currency firms,” he said.\n\nBrito also pointed out the obvious need to create a new regulatory environment where startups are not forced to get a license from every state in which they wish to operate.\n\n“Politically, these options are uphill battles, but if we don’t think big, somebody else will,” he said.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Ether, a crypto token used for transactions on the platform, has seen a drastic increase in value lately, making it the second largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin.\n\nWith more and more people making investments in Ether, many exchanges catering to bitcoin traders have started including Ethereum trading services.\n\nInterestingly, some of the lesser-known digital currency regions are among the first ones to add Ethereum to the list of their exchange services. After Korbit in Korea and Coincheck in Japan, BitBay is the very first exchange company to offer trading for Ethereum in Poland.\n\nBitBay Mission\n\nFounded in 2014, BitBay offers online exchange services similar to other companies. However, BitBay stands out from the crowd. Developing its services, founders strived to make them fast, and as secure and trustworthy as possible.\n\nBitBay puts the ensuring of the safety of transactions at the top of their priorities. It utilizes powerful redundant dedicated servers and keeps all of its customers’ funds in encrypted cold wallets. BitBay offers 2-factor authentication provided by Rublon and a number of additional security options, including Google Authenticator and email notifications.\n\nIn addition, BitBay aims to provide timely customer support, as time is money and BitBay does not want their users to experience any difficulties and delays in transactions. Besides offering contact via email, hotline, live chat and through their website, the company’s office in Katowice welcomes its customers during weekdays.\n\nThis certainly contributes to trust building, especially in the current situation where security failures, scams and thefts in bitcoin businesses seem to be commonplace.\n\nDedication and ambitious plans\n\nBitBay is ambitious in their plans and aspirations. One of their main objectives is to become noticeable on the global market. Adjusting exchange services to the preferences of foreign users was the first step, which was successfully achieved.\n\nTo be successful in the global arena, a company should fit the expectations of new and potential customers.\n\nTherefore, BitBay is constantly expanding their offers to online payment operators, establishing partnerships and cooperations with payment services, alongside introducing new services, Ethereum trading being one of them.\n\nFuture of cryptocurrency in Poland\n\nCoinTelegraph had a chance to chat with Justyna Laskowska Witek from BitBay to discuss the company’s latest updates to their services.\n\nJustyna Laskowska says:\n\n“This month we have introduced Ethereum trading. There are not so many Ethereum trading platforms worldwide, and BitBay is the first one of such kind in Poland. We offer our users a possibility to trade ETH against PLN, BTC, EUR, and USD”.\n\nJustyna also shares her view on the current climate for digital currencies in Poland and prospects of its development.\n\nShe characterizes the overall trends as quite positive:\n\n“Bitcoin is gaining a massive interest, and you can see it from latest reports, which shows the daily trading volume of Bitcoin being over 2000 BTC and growing. Indicators for Ethereum look good as well with volume in ETH being around 500 - 1000 ETH per day.”\n\nThe number of people who understand how cryptocurrencies work, and especially of those who actually use them, is still very limited in Poland.\n\nExpanding possibilities\n\nHowever, lately Bitcoin has been receiving greater coverage from mainstream media both in Poland and internationally, which certainly fosters discussions about cryptocurrencies and their use, raises awareness and alleviates the suspiciousness of digital currency technologies currently in place in banks and governments.\n\nOne of the greatest developments on this matter is the fact that more and more reputable companies have started accepting payments in Bitcoin.\n\nA few years back, there was no place for Bitcoin enthusiasts to exchange or spend their mined coins. In order to do so, they had to use foreign platforms, which generated additional costs and was rather time-consuming.\n\nLaskowska says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Today one can easily shop groceries in BTC, pay for software, files, and graphical projects, and even buy flowers and jewellery. Bitcoin being exempt from VAT is only favorable for Polish bitcoin companies and gives hope for further development.”\n\nLast November, BitBay started offering cash withdrawals in ATMs located in Poland and is planning to introduce more options this year, which will significantly expand the possibilities of Bitcoin in Poland.\n\nWith Ethereum becoming more widely available, entering the Polish market is certainly a great achievement both for users and businesses. Having introduced Ethereum trading, BitBay is highly motivated to develop in that direction as well.', 'Another person involved in the operation of failed Bitcoin exchange Coin.mx has been arrested following the ongoing investigation by Federal Authorities into the case.\n\n65-year-old Michael Murgio from Palm Beach County, Florida, the father of Anthony Murgio who was arrested back in July in relation to the operation of the exchange, has been indicted in the United States Federal Court in Manhattan for his role in participating in a scheme to pay bribes to let the exchange’s operators gain control of a credit union.\n\nMichael Murgio’s direct role in the scheme is not clear from reports, but we do know his son Anthony became involved with the credit union after he, and fellow accused Yuri Lebedev failed to deceive major financial institutions to accept funds from Coin.mx by pretending they were running the “Collectables Club,” a members-only association of individuals who discussed, bought, and sold collectible items.\n\nMurgio Junior and Lebedev are then alleged to have obtained beneficial control of Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union to use as a way to channel funds from Coin.mx through bribery, including the bribery of Trevon Gross, a pastor and former chairman of the credit union.\n\nUltimately their greed got the better of them as a serious increase in funds flowing through the credit union came to the attention of the National Credit Union Administration, who then alerted authorities that something untoward was going on.\n\nMoney laundering\n\nThere has never been a definitive figure as to how much Coin.mx dealt with prior to its closure, but we do know for sure that they had tens of thousands of customers, meaning that potentially it was involved in the money laundering of tens of millions of dollars, including money from ransomware scams.\n\nThe charges against those previously indicted include conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, along with allegations that owner Gery Shalon was involved in the hacking of JP Morgan.\n\nMurgio senior is expected to appear before a court April 26 while Murgio junior is currently out on bail with an expected hearing date set for October.\n\nImage credit: Coin.mx/ screenshot', 'In less than two months, online businesses have paid more than $100,000 to scammers who set up a fake distributed denial-of-service gang that has yet to launch a single attack.\n\nFurther Reading How extorted e-mail provider got back online after crippling DDoS attack The charlatans sent businesses around the globe extortion e-mails threatening debilitating DDoS attacks unless the recipients paid as much as $23,000 by Bitcoin in protection money, according to a blog post published Monday by CloudFlare, a service that helps protect businesses from such attacks. Stealing the name of an established gang that was well known for waging such extortion rackets, the scammers called themselves the Armada Collective.\n\n""If you don\'t pay by [date], attack will start, yours service going down permanently price to stop will increase to increase to 20 BTC and will go up 10 BTC for every day of the attack,"" the typical demand stated.

According to a security analyst contacted by CloudFlare, Armada Collective Bitcoin addresses have received more than $100,000.\n\n""The extortion emails encourage targeted victims to Google for the Armada Collective,"" CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince wrote.

Advancements in information-sharing technology, including data analytics, cloud computing, wireless sensors, smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations and blockchain technology seem to be fuelling not just a disruption but a revolution, fuelled by the invention of Bitcoin and blockchain tech.\n\nAccording to a recent report, almost 90 percent of 800 experts surveyed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) believe that the Internet of Things (IoT) will reach a tipping point of 1 trillion connected devices in a decade. Moreover, 58 percent of the experts believe that 10 percent of global gross domestic product will be stored on blockchain technology by 2025.\n\nFrom smart young men and women in their basement garages to pioneering giants such as Intel, a race is underway to make possible what seems futuristic: traffic managing itself, lights operating on their own, cars communicating with each other, charging stations buying products from manufacturers, refrigerators ordering your dinner ? and that’s only the low-hanging fruit.\n\nThe first industrial revolution followed the invention of steam power in 1784; mass production sparked the second revolution of the 1870s; and the invention of electronic and IT systems in the 1970s led to the third revolution. The fourth revolution showing signs of being well underway could be identified as that of the “cyber-physical systems.”\n\nThe Rise of the Intelligent Machines\n\nWhat has slowly been building for two decades has started to gain steam due to the invention of digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes referred to as programmable money, these currencies and systems allow machines to have their own Bitcoin addresses, which function much like bank accounts due to Bitcoin’s permissionless nature. In combination with other technologies, “bank account power” gives machines, in effect, a level of intelligence that allows them to manage and allocate funds according to stated rules.\n\nA new study describes a business model for these machines, one currently practiced by a handful of startups such as Slock.it. In describing the need for intelligent machines to have access to data, and the issues that arise when they encounter difficulties due to centralized providers’ account requirements, the study suggests a solution in the creation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). To fund DAO creation, a token is issued and then freely traded, with its value reflecting the productivity of the DAO. In this way the machine can access the data directly and pay for it digitally.\n\nIn its foundation, the DAO is simply code. But this code allows it to speak by sending or receiving information, act by making payments, and even think – albeit what we have told it to think – by analyzing data and making decisions, according to the rules, on the amount that is to be invested and the nature of such investment.\n\nBillions Are Pouring In\n\nAccording to a May 2015 report by CNN Money, a small number of well-capitalized Silicon Valley companies were a year ago sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars due to the uncertainties of the recent recession. However, as new opportunities arise, they are now apparently starting to invest more as they position themselves for what a Cisco report estimated in 2013 to be an almost $15 trillion IoT market in the next decade.\n\nFintech, a subset of IoT and itself an umbrella term for technology-empowered financial innovation with blockchain tech a front-seat driver, experienced more than 60 percent growth in the first quarter of this year with global investment rising to $5.3 billion.\n\nThe sleeping giants are once again moving. Intel quietly went to China and, signalling a shift in pace, asked their manufacturers to focus on IoT products. HP announced a new partnership to study “intelligent transportation.” IBM opened a completely new IoT research center in combination with the University of South Carolina. Meanwhile, Microsoft is keen to introduce developers to Azure IoT, with some taking advantage of the opportunity to ensure their beer is cool and refreshing.\n\nWhile many components are needed to build this new future, permissionless, programmable money is the energizing fuel. For the first time, digital currencies allow machines to exchange value, trade, negotiate, buy and sell. Previously, giant centralized institutions acted as gatekeepers, requiring permission for access to their infrastructures, thus making it difficult, if even possible, for machines to hold money. Bitcoin has helped change that.\n\nOne of the genius aspects of Bitcoin is that it turns money into pure and free information, thus transforming physical cash and gold into the natural habitat of machines which are experts at managing, storing, manipulating and communicating information.\n\nHowever, like the laying of the railroads or the Internet cables, we are still at the infrastructure-building stage. Some suggest that advancements in technology are now becoming exponential, and, according to the WEF study, will hit a tipping point in the next 10 years, transforming the world in the process and giving rise to a full-blown revolution of intelligent machines.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/developer-s-introduction-to-azure-iot/\n\nhttp://www.valuewalk.com/2016/04/intel-chinese-firms-develop-iot-products/\n\nhttp://www.telecompaper.com/news/ibm-university-of-south-carolina-open-iot-research-centre--1138755\n\nhttp://www.digitimes.com/news/a20160319PD201.html\n\nhttp://gunnarpeipman.com/2016/02/beer-iot-building-universal-windows-application-to-monitor-cooling-process/\n\nhttp://uk.businessinsider.com/accenture-report-investors-backed-fintech-with-56-billion-2016-4\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac79/docs/innov/IoE_Economy.pdf\n\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12083-016-0456-1#page-1""]"
04/26/2016,"['Blockchain, the technology that underpins the bitcoin currency may be used to increase efficiency in distribution of taxpayer money\n\nThe UK government is exploring using the blockchain technology that underpins the bitcoin currency to increase efficiency in the distribution of taypayers’ money such as grants, a minister said on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nA blockchain works as a decentralised ledger that is verified and shared by a network of computers, and can be used to record data as well as to secure and validate an exchange of assets, such as currencies or commodities.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions are increasingly investing in blockchain technology, reckoning it could cut their costs and make their operations faster and more transparent.\n\nThe cabinet office minister Matt Hancock said the government was examining how the technology could be used to manage and keep track of the distribution of public money, such as grants and student loans, saying it could “foster a new culture of trust”.\n\n“The government cannot bury its head in the sand and ignore new technologies as they emerge,” Hancock, who holds the post of paymaster general, said a blockchain networking event in London.\n\n“That is partly what happened in the past in government with the web … We cannot let (that) happen again by standing still.”\n\nBritain has had a patchy record with government IT systems. Previous IT problems have hit the passport agency, the tax credit system and most notably the National Health Service which was forced in 2011 to announce the abandonment of a multibillion pound scheme to computerise every patient record.\n\nHancock cautioned against getting too caught up in the hype. “Blockchain technology is not going to solve every problem; it’s not going to work in every context,” he said.\n\nIt is still early days for blockchain: The original bitcoin blockchain was started just over seven years ago, and most financiers and technologists reckon the technology will not be adopted broadly for another five to 10. Many compare the current level of development to the early days of the internet.\n\nThis year, the government’s chief scientific advisor urged the government to explore how it could use blockchain. The Bank of England has called it a “key technological innovation”, and has a team working on ways that it could be used, such as for issuing central bank money.', 'Because of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, the global economy flourishes without the normal limitations of nationalities and borders.\n\nBitcoin was conceived without consideration of, or restriction from, governments, nationalities, or borders. Because of its decentralized nature and ease of transaction, it is equally accessible to users in all corners of the world, so long as they have a device with a reliable internet connection.\n\nThis has led to a global financial system less influenced by national borders.\n\nEasier cross-border transactions\n\nBecause most economic transactions in the past have dealt in traditional currencies, which are issued and controlled by governments, commerce usually pays strict attention to national borders. However, according to Pétur Árnason, Chairman of the Auraráð foundation, this is beginning to change thanks to blockchain technology.\n\nÁrnason says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“The blockchain technology has brought to the stage new mechanics for commerce that will undoubtedly change the dynamics in the relationship between buyer and merchant. This revolutionary technology will reduce if not completely remove some of the boundaries that currently exist within a purchase process that occurs between national borders.”\n\nMarco Montes Neri, founder of mobile payments platform Saldo.mx, has seen Bitcoin and blockchain technology surpass borders to a great degree, calling it a “regulatory agnostic.”\n\nNeri explains to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Within the store of value aspect of Bitcoin it is the first universal “nostro account” (for those who are familiar with correspondent banking) which creates an opportunity to connect payment networks. In reality is hard to integrate with those networks due to the state of the legacy systems, but it is matter of time (as payment networks evolve) that cross border settlement will occur there, either for securities or other forms of value. It just works.”\n\nA tale of a truly global economy\n\nMartin Jansen, a member of the Auroracoin development team, recounted a story of employing a programmer in India using Bitcoin.\n\nJansen tells CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Then we became more acquainted and it seemed he was extremely good at programing websites and learning new stuff. So I asked him, can you port this Hive stuff? He said he would look into it and after two days he already had a working beta version that actually looked more like an end product to me! I was so amazed with his skills and devotion, I decided to ask for his BTC address so I could send him some appreciation. After transferring 0.5 BTC he immediately responded asking if I lost my mind. It seems I just transferred the equivalent of his monthly salary (and he has a good job as a programmer).” Thanks to blockchain technology, this business partnership resulted in, as Jansen puts it, “a Stargate-like bridge between our two monetary dimensions, and we seem to profit from it both!”\n\nJansen continues:\n\n“This immediately made me realize we had found an absolute win-win situation based on blockchain tech. We found a timeless bridge between two different dimensions of wealth. Here I was, paying at least € 1300 a month for my mortgage and another € 1100 for my car while he was living in a neat house for € 75 and drove a nice car for € 90. The product he delivered though, would cost me at least 20x the price if I would order it in my dimension. Still, he was the luckiest guy around, because he found an idiot on another dimension paying a month salary, for only two days work.”\n\nThe end of borders?\n\nFor Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, founder of Bitnation, Bitcoin’s borderless aspects represent something much greater than simply easier international transactions.\n\nTempelhof says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“The Nation state construct is an artificial concept, that was created during the Treaty of Westphalia 1648, cementing the global oligopoly on governance, which we now know as nation states. It has been around for less than 400 years, and has not worked out particularly well. The end of the Westphalian world order has been imminent for some time, through trends like cheaper transportation, global trade, and - of course - communications.” Tempelhof continues by saying that globalization, and the technology that furthers its adoption, is better for local cultures than the nation-state system, and that “a post nation world enables both a more global world, as well as a more local world, at the same time.”\n\nTempelhof notes:\n\n“Internet and the technologies it brought with it, VOIP, social networks, and of course -- digital currencies -- is in my opinion the final stage in that revolution. The ability it gives us to organise ourselves peer-to-peer, to transcend cultural and geographical boundaries all while strengthening our own cultures and groups, beyond the coercion of forced upon entities like the current Orwellien so called ""nations"" we live under.”\n\nThe end of government as we know it?\n\nFinally, according to Tempelhof, the power of blockchain technology has the ability to end the entire modern concept of government.\n\nTempelhof concludes:', 'A bitcoin transaction with a 291 BTC fee worth $136,700 was processed as part of block 409,008 on the bitcoin network today, sparking speculation as to the nature of what many are considering a colossal error by an unknown user.\n\nThe fee, one of many sent daily to pay bitcoin’s mining network for processing, managed to draw attention on social media due to its notable size. The average cost to clear a transaction on the bitcoin network was 31 satoshis, or roughly $0.01 at press time, a factor providing evidence of a potentially erroneous transaction.\n\nNow, bitcoin mining pool BitClub, which claims to operate two mining locations in Iceland, has sent an email to users in which it asserted that it mined the block. BitClub said it earned a total of 316 BTC (or about $147,000) in fees, the figure equalling the fee plus the 25 BTC network reward.\n\nHowever, in the email, the mining pool said that it is willing to return the fee, should the user come forward and identify themselves.\n\nBitClub wrote:\n\n""We are currently waiting for someone to reach out to us and claim their mistake so that we can verify them and send their bitcoin back, but so far as of this posting nobody has been able to verify it.""\n\nBrock Pierce, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, told CoinDesk that BitClub has reached out to trade organization, offering to donate some of the funds should the user not reveal themselves after one week’s time.\n\n""We would like to provide a portion to Bitcoin Core development, and will be open for other allocation options that benefit the community as a whole,"" BitClub’s email read.\n\nThe mining service said it has been researching the transaction and that it believes it was possibly sent by a bitcoin mixing service, a type of online offering aimed at privacy and anonymity but that is nonetheless associated with illicit use.\n\nPierce said that he believes it is unlikely any users would come forward due to the risks of being associated with any large, potentially unregulated transactions.\n\nBitClub sells three different mining pool products, though it has been the subject of speculation due to the anonymity of its owners.\n\nAt press time, BitClub did not respond to requests for further comment.\n\nMissed dart image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The advent of government-controlled money made this process vastly simpler.\n\nHowever, with the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology, state power to tax income is slipping, and may at some point become a thing of the past entirely.\n\nEfficient taxation requires compliance\n\nAt its root, taxation is based on compliance of the taxed. Now by no means does that mean that citizens would pay taxes if they could choose otherwise, but rather that they do so rather than face repercussions.\n\nIt would be logistically impossible for a governing body to collect funds from the entire citizenry without any meaningful compliance from the taxed. As it stands in the United States, the current taxation system is broken and ineffective.\n\nWith the likelihood of an audit very small for the average citizen, many are able to cut corners on reporting income with very few consequences.\n\nCryptocurrency can make identifying income extremely difficult\n\nThe advent of blockchain technology further complicates tax collection. Cryptocurrency is extremely impractical to trace.\n\nTo begin with, while all Bitcoin transactions are public and viewable by anyone, the ownership or control over wallets and addresses are not. Simply use different addresses, and financial investigation is effectively obfuscated from a superficial investigation.\n\nEmploy a VPN for extra privacy, and use a coin-mixing service to thoroughly mix up which transactions represent legitimate economic activity and which were simply diversionary nonsense.\n\nTo take it a step further, use alternative cryptocurrencies like Dash (which has its own mixed “darksend” feature) or Monero (which, among many other features, uses ring signatures to hide legitimate cryptographic signatures amongst a host of decoys).\n\nFor extra fun, use all of the above to weave an intricate puzzle nearly impossible to decipher, and absolutely not worth the trouble for all but the biggest targets.\n\nCryptocurrency may evolve beyond any legal definitions of currency\n\nFinally, the very definition of income is fast becoming a moving target. To begin with, a new cryptocurrency can be minted almost instantly, rendering obsolete and inapplicable all laws that specifically name a particular cryptocurrency.\n\nEven if all cryptocurrency were to be legally classified as taxable income, blockchain-based crypto-tokens could narrowly escape the definition of currency by semantics, and yet still be a viable form of trade.\n\nIf all else fails, determined tax evaders can simply adopt a gifting economy, using a blockchain system to keep track of who had given what to whom. Which, after all, is all money really is, stripped to its base elements.\n\nA new age is upon us, thanks to technology. Governments, once able to control currency and ensure they were able to claim a portion of their citizenry’s income as their own, will soon lose this power.\n\nThanks to cryptocurrency, we may see the end of taxation.', 'Bitcoin prices have more than doubled over the last year, enjoying a period of reasonable growth as the digital currency continues to establish its legitimacy.\n\nGlobal bitcoin prices reached an inter-day high of $470.16 on 26th April, more than 100% above the inter-day high of $219.93 reached on the same day in 2015.\n\nThe digital currency has been experiencing a steady, upward climb over the last week, breaking through key price levels of $440, $450 and $460 as markets respond to the latest progress made toward addressing the blockchain block capacity dilemma.\n\nThe currency surpassed $440 on 20th April, the day after developers released Segregated Witness, code for a protocol update that would allow blocks on the bitcoin blockchain to hold a greater number of transactions.\n\nBitcoin has continued to benefit from this momentum, climbing past $450 on 21st April and $460 on 24th April. This ascent continued until the currency rose reached the aforementioned price of $470.16 at 18:00 UTC on 26th April.\n\nThe growth bitcoin prices enjoyed over the last week provides a contrast to the holding pattern they experienced in the several weeks beforehand. For roughly a month before the recent rally, bitcoin prices were locked in a range between $410 and $440.\n\nThe upward movement experienced through the week ending 26th April also provides a contrast to the sharp gains bitcoin experienced in late 2013, when its price skyrocketed from roughly $200 to more than $1,000.\n\nCharles L.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', ""Peter Todd is one of the longest-serving core bitcoin developers remaining; a Canadian with 92 separate contributions to the bitcoin code base to date. He has worked on projects like Colored Coins, Counterparty, and Stealth Addresses, but is best known as someone who searches for vulnerabilities in the bitcoin system.\n\nLast Thursday, Todd published an article claiming that the MIT ChainAnchor Project is, “in part an attempt to get Bitcoin users to register their real world identities and associate their transactions with those identities.”\n\n- Peter Todd\n\nTodd supplied supporting evidence in the form of a leaked document, that has not yet officially been confirmed by ChainAnchor, and a slideshow presentation that is currently published on MIT's website. The former is a preliminary preview paper of the ChainAnchor whitepaper, dated January 24th. The latter is a PDF-formatted slideshow from February.\n\nThe gist of the ChainAnchor system is to ensure that fully-AML-compliant identification is attached to public addresses on a given blockchain, 'whitelisting' them, and eventually ensuring that all transactions on that chain are completely transparent and user-traceable.\n\nIn the introductory paragraph of the leaked draft of the whitepaper, however, ChainAnchor states that their architecture “adds an identity and privacy-preserving layer above the blockchain, either the private blockchain or the public Blockchain in Bitcoin.”\n\nAccording to the whitepaper, in order to apply this system to Bitcoin, one merely has to convince bitcoin miners to only accept transactions that are from these whitelisted public IDs. According to the leaked January draft, doing so would simply be a matter of rewarding miners in some additional way, such as a direct monetary reward for compliance.\n\n- ChainAnchor in 'Anonymous Identities for Permissioned Blockchains,' Page 10\n\nThe way Bitcoin has been designed normally ensures that miners will want to do the opposite, keeping transactions pseudo-anonymous and processing them quickly. Doing so results in successfully mining more blocks, and therefore winning more of the block rewards.\n\nIf Todd is correct, ChainAnchor's purpose reverses this. “In short, ChainAnchor appears to be attempting to make the existing permissionless Bitcoin block-chain into a centrally controlled, permissioned chain,” states Todd.\n\nChainAnchor responsed to the allegations by reiterating that their system is not meant for Bitcoin, and is clearly labelled “for permissioned blockchains.”\n\n- ChainAnchor\n\nAccording to Todd, the ChainAnchor system also carries another major threat, it removes the trustless nature of Bitcoin derived from decentralization. “The privacy of the system is based on trust,” he says about the ChainAnchor system. “The permissions verifier and identity provider can undetectably deanonymize a user by colluding to combine the real-world identity and cryptographic identity information that each side is supposed to keep secret from the other.”\n\n- Todd\n\nSources for the leaked documents have not been provided, but Todd mentioned that they came from multiple people. “I’ve obtained leaked copies of their preliminary paper and overview slides from multiple sources, (most recently from MIT themselves)” he said. “I’ve also been contacted by people who alleged that they was approached by the ChainAnchor group for monetary and strategic partnership assistance. These people have given me further (alleged) details on the longer-term goals of the project in the context of Bitcoin.”\n\nSince he has chosen not to name their names, he suggests using this event as a threat model exercise, meaning that developers should treat it like a real attack and prepare a defense against it.\n\n- Todd"", 'Last week, the VPN service Cloak found a frightening message in its inbox:""We are Armada Collective,"" the email read. ""We have launched the largest DDoS [distributed denial-of-service attack] in Swiss history and one of the largest DDoS attacks ever… All your servers will be DDoS-ed starting Monday (April 25) if you don’t pay our protection fee — exactly 10.06 Bitcoins."" A bitcoin address was provided, along with a threat that for each day, the price would increase by an additional 10 bitcoin, roughly $4,400.\n\nCloak decided not to pay, pushing back with a note to users a few days later. ""We apologize for any disruption as a result of these attacks; please know that we will do everything in our power to thwart them,"" the company wrote in a blog post today. ""But let us reiterate: no matter what happens, we simply will not pay these garden-variety thugs."" (The last sentence was later removed.) In the days that followed, the company discovered that a number of other VPN services had received the same note. Whoever was sending the threats had been busy.\n\nThe mysterious attackers were all talk\n\nIt’s unclear why Cloak and similar VPN services were targeted, but their infrastructure leaves them uniquely vulnerable to DDoS. Denial-of-service attacks work by sending floods of phony traffic to a service, making it impossible for administrators to distinguish between bad requests and legitimate users. Websites can mitigate that damage by rerouting traffic and caching pages across the network — but VPN services can’t protect themselves nearly as well.\n\nWhen Monday came, however, the promised attack never arrived. Calling around, Peck found that other threatened VPN services had also come away clean. As it turned out, the mysterious attackers were all talk.\n\nThat routine turns out to be remarkably common, although most targets never go public. The same group that targeted Cloak sends nearly identical messages to between six and 10 targets every day, according to various estimates from content delivery networks. A recent post by CloudFlare identified more than 100 different attacks from the group since March. Even more surprising, CloudFlare couldn’t identify a single one that had resulted in a measurable denial-of-service attack. Whoever contacted Cloak is good at making threats, apparently, but has no interest in following through.\n\n""We have customers that receive this on a quarterly basis.""\n\nThat doesn’t mean nobody’s paying. CloudFlare reported more than $100,000 sent to Armada-linked bitcoin addresses since March. Often times, different attacks requested funds to be sent to identical Bitcoin addresses. Since Bitcoin wallets are typically anonymous, that would make it effectively impossible to tell which targets paid and which didn’t. (Strangely, someone appears to have sent $2 to the account named in Cloak’s ransom email, although it’s unclear where the money came from or why.)\n\nThe attack works because, historically, denial-of-service ransoms have been an effective and popular scheme for online criminals. Most targets never go public, but recent attacks were aimed at popular services like Meetup, Feedly, and even three Greek banks.\n\nOver time, experts have seen attackers get lazier, sending out more messages but executing fewer and fewer attacks. ""It’s a return on investment,"" says Yuri Frayman, CEO of ZenEdge, which specializes in mitigating denial-of-service attacks. ""It doesn’t cost any money to send out a blanket of emails once you have the right contacts. You often get payments for almost no effort. It’s a spray-and-pray approach to getting paid.""\n\nIn many cases, even a failed attack won’t deter criminals from trying again. ""We have customers that receive this on a quarterly basis, and we consistently mitigate the attack for them, and the attackers come back a few months later almost as if it’s a robot,"" Frayman says.\n\nArmada Collective is a particularly tricky case. The group became prominent in November after a major attack on a string of secure email services including ProtonMail, taking many of the services down for several days. But it’s not at all clear that the people who threatened Cloak are the same people who took down ProtonMail. In November, many analysts linked Armada Collective to an earlier group called DD4BC (DDoS For Bitcoin). Many DD4BC members were arrested by a Europol investigation in January. According to CloudFlare, Armada Collective threats have been largely quiet for the four months after the ProtonMail attacks. That suggests the new group may be a copycat that’s simply taken on Armada’s name as a way to scare targets.\n\nStill, the rise of phony threats may cause problems for criminals in the long run. The traditional advice to a company targeted by a denial-of-service threat is not to pay on general principle. A target that pays encourages criminals and opens itself up to further demands down the road. After the latest back of threats, there may be a third reason: the criminals could very well be bluffing.', 'What is typically thought of as the peer-to-peer or sharing economy — think Uber or Airbnb — could some day become so peer-to-peer that drivers and riders or hosts and guests connect to each other directly through their smart phones and ditch those companies as middlemen.\n\nOr so goes the vision of Luis Fernando Molina, the chief executive and founder of Fermat.org, a platform that enables “decentralized applications” that connect users directly to each other without the need for an intermediary. The system uses a technology similar to what powers Bitcoin transactions, often referred to as a blockchain.\n\nTuesday, the organization announces the publication of a white paper describing how the platform, which also offers a way for content creators to manage the copyright of their work and for developers to be paid modularly for app components that they create, works. Operating in stealth for two years, Fermat already has more than 60 full-time contributors collaborating on its open source platform that Molina hopes will launch an “Internet of People.”\n\n“We will see an evolution from social to peer-to-peer,” says Molina, comparing Fermat to the file-sharing service BitTorrent, because it is a device-to-device-based network.\n\nThe release of the white paper comes in the wake of excitement in the Bitcoin community about the launch of another decentralized application, OpenBazaar, a peer-to-peer version of eBay, in which buyers and sellers can download OpenBazaar’s desktop software and connect directly to each other without a third-party marketplace taking a cut of the transaction.\n\nIn the peer-to-peer, Fermat-powered version of Airbnb, someone who wants to let a room would download the Fermat host version of the app and upload information about the room. (Fermat apps are nested inside of the Fermat application, which, when opened, shows a new mobile phone desktop holding all the user’s Fermat app icons.) People with Fermat’s guest version of the app who had appropriate search criteria would find the offering. Once a guest and host decide to make a deal, they chat through the app themselves, without having to use a middleman. And when payment is exchanged, they can use a currency like Bitcoin to transact directly with each other — sans bank or PayPal fees. Molina says that Fermat will give users direct control of their personal digital footprint, as well as more privacy.\n\nOther types of services that could be created using the system include online dating, classifieds, apartment rental, permanent and freelance job search, coupons/vouchers/discounts and more.\n\nWhile companies like Airbnb provide crucial background and reputation management checks, Molina says the Fermat system provides a similar function. Users can build their reputations either through several profiles — one for their reputation as an Airbnb host, one for online dating, and one for a freelance work platform — or having one reputation that connects all the profiles to each other. Eventually, companies could offer such services specifically for Fermat users.\n\nThe platform also enables atomized, modular app creation, in which developers don’t unnecessarily duplicate work. Each component in the Fermat system is “white-labeled,” which means each product is created generically and can be packaged, branded and sold by other companies.\n\nFor example, if a developer creates a good chat function, another developer wanting chat in their online dating app could use the first developer’s chat module, and any time a user of the online dating app uses chat, a micropayment would go to the original developer.\n\n“We believed for a long time that atoms were the smallest unit,” says Molina, adding that later on, subatomic particles such as protons, etc., were discovered. Similarly, he says “Google and Apple told us that applications were the smallest thing, that it was the smallest unit of ownership. But as with atoms, it’s not true. The next step for me was to design a new model where reusable components could be the new ownership level, so that we could build applications out of components. And that is what Fermat is doing.”\n\nThe system also enables copyright enforcement and micro-payments to content creators. Under Fermat, an author could publish something to a blockchain — an immutable, public ledger — and use the platform to automatically handle copyright transfers and sales as well as the right to consume the content. The author could also define micro-payment fees for the consumption of their work and receive payment from derivations.\n\n“Laura, as a journalist, might be writing blogs, and you cannot prevent, in the current web, someone from taking some of the things you write and republishing it somewhere else without even referring to you,” says Molina. “We are currently creating an artist platform in which you can publish things on this platform and create your content as a digital asset. And a digital asset is something that, in our system, is a combination of three things: a multimedia element, such as a picture, a video, a song or an article or e-book or whatever. The second thing is a digital contract or the terms and conditions to use that digital asset, and the third part is a little piece of cryptocurrency that allows you to have ownership of the rights and transfer ownership or sell that digital asset."" So a writer could publish an article as a digital asset, and then set terms and conditions saying that anyone who reads their article has to pay them 1/1000th of a dollar, or that if they want to transfer that digital asset, then they need to pay the creator a penny.\n\nMolina, who began his career in Internet banking systems 20 years ago, was most recently running a company named Inception in Dubai that automated the non-repetitive design of geometric patterns in modern architecture. While there, he discovered Bitcoin and went to pitch a sheikh on a Bitcoin business. “After I gave him my architecture business card, this sheikh told me, ‘Do you know that this word Inception in Arabic, if I add one dot below this first letter, do you know what it would read?’ I said, ‘No, it can read anything. Any word in the world.’ He said, ‘If I put one dot below the first letter, it would read Bitcoin,’” recalls Molina, who thought the sheikh was pulling his leg. “So I went to my factory and I asked all the employees in Arabic — I pulled out my business card and put the dot there and they read Bitcoin, so I immediately quit and I started Fermat.”\n\nMolina is based in Budapest, but developers contribute to the platform from around the globe. Philip Farah, the former global head of financial services consulting at Cisco Systems has joined Fermat’s board and said in a statement, “Beyond the obvious advantages to the developer community, Fermat will deliver significant benefits to end users and businesses. For end users, it will lower transaction costs for both buyers and sellers and give back user control over one’s personal information and digital content. For businesses, it will provide access to low cost digital marketing and distribution channels and a platform to deliver value-added services such as market research and insurance.”', 'Swift, the international settlement network which connects 11,000 global banks has likely been hacked according to a report by BAE Systems.\n\n“An unknown attacker gained access to the Bangladesh Bank’s (BB) SWIFT payment system and reportedly instructed an American bank to transfer money from BB’s account to accounts in The Philippines.”\n\nSophisticated attack\n\nAs part of a sophisticated attack, a malware was installed on a Swift Alliance software server to cover tracks and evade detection by manipulating the security measures.\n\nThe attackers intended to transfer almost one billion dollars from Bangladesh Bank’s account at the Federal Reserve to other banks. It appears that the intrusion was detected due to a “spelling mistake in one transfer order” according to the BBC, before the full funds could be transferred. Almost $100 million are however still unaccounted.\n\nBAE Systems researchers state:\n\n“This malware was written bespoke for attacking a specific victim infrastructure, but the general tools, techniques and procedures used in the attack may allow the gang to strike again… This attacker put significant effort into deleting evidence of their activities, subverting normal business processes to remain undetected and hampering the response from the victim.”\n\nThey further suggest that “All financial institutions who run SWIFT Alliance Access and similar systems should be seriously reviewing their security now to make sure they too are not exposed.”\n\nIn a press release issued today Swift stated that the “malware has no impact on SWIFT’s network or core messaging services… the malware is designed to hide the traces of fraudulent payments from customers’ local database applications and can only be installed on users’ local systems by attackers that have successfully identified and exploited weaknesses in their local security.”\n\nBitcoin Shows Its Superiority Over the Current Centralized Approach\n\nThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) handles millions of financial transactions a day, connecting banks in over 200 countries. It is the primary method used by banks to send payment orders and settle accounts facilitating trillions of dollars in transactions.\n\nIn a way, it performs a service no different than Bitcoin. However, rather than having many corresponding nodes and miners verifying transactions, it is centralized. Access to a Swift server, therefore, allows for manipulation of the data and potentially theft in a grand scale.\n\nIn this case, analysis of code repository uploaded from Bangladesh showed that the malware allowed the hackers to delete records and intercept incoming messages.\n\nMoreover, they were able to intercept confirming messages sent for printing as a security measure. Sending instead “manipulated copies”, thus evading detection and potentially running away with huge sums of money.\n\n“The main purpose is to inspect SWIFT messages for strings defined in the configuration file. From these messages, the malware can extract fields such as transfer references and SWIFT addresses to interact with the system database. These details are then used to delete specific transactions, or update transaction amounts appearing in balance reporting messages based on the amount of Convertible Currency available in specific accounts,” Sergei Shevchenko of BAE Systems said in the report.\n\nSuch manipulation would be relatively easy in a centralized database once access is gained, however it is virtually impossible in the decentralized ledger employed by Bitcoin.\n\nInstead of one database with a centralized verification or confirmation system which can be manipulated, Bitcoin’s blockchain currently uses approximately 5,000 databases (nodes) across the globe.\n\nTheir job is to ensure that no manipulation has occurred with their results further enforced by miners which through a proof of work system confirm transactions.\n\nOnce a transaction is verified, it is as good as impossible for it to be changed. Care must however be taken to secure your private keys either through a multi signature - decentralized - wallet or by using cold storage.\n\nThe benefits of this decentralized approach are now widely recognised with almost all global banks looking to employ the blockchain in their own systems.\n\nIncluding Swift, which late last year announced a global payment initiative focusing on developing a blockchain roadmap.\n\nAs the vulnerability of the centralized approach has now clearly been shown in contrast to Bitcoin’s database which has never been hacked by an individual, such initiatives may have added a sense of urgency so as to restore trust in the current global financial clearing system.', 'It has now been eight years since Satoshi Nakamoto released his peer-to-peer digital cash system to the world, and the debate over whether or not the payment network and currency have any real, long-term value is still undecided. Having said that, some real-world use cases have emerged. Bitcoin transaction volume continues to grow year-to-year, which means someone, somewhere finds Bitcoin to be the proper way to transfer value online.\n\nAlthough there are many different reasons as to why someone would become interested in Bitcoin, there are five that stand out from the rest.\n\n1. Digital Gold\n\nNathaniel Popper picked the perfect title for his book, Digital Gold, which details the history of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has many features similar to gold, and it’s superior in more ways than one (more divisible, portable, durable, etc.). The only area where the digital currency cannot compete with physical gold is fungibility, but that’s an issue that may be solved in the future via privacy improvements to the system.\n\nThe various use cases of the Bitcoin blockchain are what drive Bitcoin’s value as a digital gold. Much as gold’s underlying value lies in its use in jewelry or electronics, Bitcoin’s underlying value lies in the fact that one must have some bitcoins to interact with the Bitcoin censorship-resistant ledger.\n\n2. Trading and Speculation\n\nThe vast majority of Bitcoin transactions happen off-blockchain, and most of those transactions are on the various Bitcoin exchanges around the world. According to Bitcoinity, the all-time record for trading volume in a single day was broken on Christmas Day 2015. The record was then broken again on the 14th of January, 2016.\n\nWhile some prefer to buy and hold, there are still plenty of speculators in the market who think they can time the bear and bull runs perfectly. There is also still plenty of activity in the altcoin market, which some view as nothing more than a casino. According to CoinCap.io, the entire altcoin market cap is roughly 15 percent the size of Bitcoin’s market cap.\n\n3. Discount Shopping\n\nPurse.io and Foldapp are two startups bringing discounts to Bitcoin users who shop at Amazon, Starbucks and Target. The backends of both of these applications rely on inefficiencies in the secondary gift card market for these particular stores. Users of Foldapp are able to get 20 percent off at Starbucks and 8 percent off at Target, while Amazon shoppers can get 25 percent or more off of their purchases when they use Purse.io.\n\nSome Bitcoin services, such as Circle, offer USD balances, which allow users to avoid the price volatility associated with Bitcoin while still gaining access to the discounts provided by these Bitcoin-powered applications.\n\n4. Darknet Marketplaces and Ransomware\n\nSome Bitcoin users don’t like to talk about it, but illegal transactions and criminal activity are still part of the Bitcoin network. Censorship-resistant transactions were the first major use case of Bitcoin (illustrated by Silk Road and Wikileaks), and the payment network’s usefulness in these kinds of financial activities is what underpins its value in the real world.\n\nAlthough the original Silk Road was taken down back in late 2013, there are still plenty of uncensored marketplaces accessible via the Tor Browser. Hackers have also had a field day with ransomware, which encrypts data on infected computers and demands bitcoins in exchange for the decryption key. There was recently a high-profile ransomware case in Los Angeles in which a hospital was forced to pay a 40 bitcoins (roughly $17,000) ransom in exchange for the ability to regain access to their patients’ data.\n\n5. Online Gambling\n\nFor some, the gamble of holding bitcoins is not enough. Satoshi Dice accounted for more than half of all Bitcoin transactions in June 2013, and the cryptocurrency-powered gambling industry is still thriving in 2016. Bet King, a bitcoin gambling website with a crowdfunded bankroll, claims to have had users wager more than 150,000 BTC with them over the course of 2015, while Primedice says their site has processed over 1 million BTC in wagers since 2013. Key players in the traditional online gambling industry, such as BetOnline and 5dimes, have also integrated Bitcoin for deposits and withdrawals.\n\n6. Sales of Digital Goods\n\nThis use case ties in with the use of Purse.io and Foldapp because it involves the sale of digital goods, which are usually irreversible trades. In addition to gift card codes, game items and currencies are also often traded online. An example of Bitcoin’s usefulness on a marketplace for digital goods that can be used in digital gaming environments is OPSkins. This platform allows users to buy and sell game items available in CS:GO, Dota 2, and Team Fortress 2. BitPay claims the marketplace is currently processing nearly $40,000 in Bitcoin payouts per day.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nInternational money transfers and micropayments are two uses cases of Bitcoin that have not seen widespread adoption up to this point, but they could see more activity in 2016.\n\nTheProtocol.tv is likely the best example of micropayments in action up to this point. This content platform is powered by PopChest, and it’s mainly used as an illustration of how Bitcoin-powered micropayments can benefit content creators. NurdRage, a popular YouTube channel with more than 600,000 subscribers, is currently testing out the PopChest platform.\n\nBrave is a new browser currently in development that will allow users to skip advertisements via micropayments to content creators. JavaScript Inventor and Mozilla Co-Founder Brendan Eich is the CEO of the company behind the browser.\n\nThe Lightning Network is also expected to be functional in 2016, which should offer improvements in the areas of micropayments and scalability in Bitcoin.\n\nFreemit, Align Commerce and Abra are three startups using Bitcoin to lower the costs of international money transfers. Bitwage and Rebit have already found some success in assisting companies and individuals in this area.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

04/27/2016,"['The U.K. government is considering the use of blockchain technology—the underlying network of the digital currency bitcoin—to more efficiently track taxpayers’ money.\n\nMinister for the Cabinet Office Matt Hancock said on Tuesday that blockchain technology has the potential to “transform the way the government works,” in the same way that typewriters streamlined the way business was done when they were first introduced.\n\n“Once again technology is radically transforming the way we do things,” Hancock said at a blockchain networking event in London. “Crucially, government cannot bury its head in the sand and ignore new technologies as they emerge. That’s partly what happened with the web.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n“Government lagged behind because it wasn’t able to get to grips with the potential the web offered. We’ve fixed that now, but we cannot let it happen again by standing still.”\n\nBlockchain technology has the potential to cut costs, improve efficiency and increase transparency by replacing a single central authority with a decentralised ledger that can be verified by a network of computers. Major banks, such as Barclays and HSBC, are already researching ways it can be implemented to improve services.\n\nHancock said the government is exploring “any and all” possible uses that blockchain technology could have within government, including the management of grant distribution and monitoring student loans.\n\n“Bitcoin proved that distributed ledgers can be used to track currency as it is passed from one entity to another,” Hancock said. “Where else could we use that? Think about the Student Loans Company tracking money all the way from Treasury to a student’s bank account. Or… tracking money all the way to the aid organisation spending the money in a country.\n\n“These are just some of the ideas we’re considering in government. We’re still in the early days. That takes time, and a lot of careful thought.”', 'Confirming a long-rumored move, gaming and digital media platform Steam is now accepting bitcoin payments through processing service BitPay.\n\nThe announcement today confirms earlier reports that Valve, the company that operates Steam, had sought to add the digital currency as a payment option.

The last time (October 2015) that the current combination of conditions coincided, bitcoin price had embarked on the strongest rally for 2015 when the Fed asserted its intention to hike rates in December.\n\nThe implication of a Fed Funds rate hike is that it will cause money flow into the US economy and, therefore, strengthen the US dollar. By not hiking today the Fed will reveal caution and a wait-and-see approach to the “global economic recovery”, as they call it. When the Fed did raise rates, in December, their action sent markets into a tailspin and bitcoin price into a deep correction.\n\nActually raising rates, it appears, is good for the US dollar, but bad for markets, including bitcoin. Delaying a rates hike, increases uncertainty and stokes the kind of market fear that sends commodities bitcoin and gold rallying.\n\nThe implication for bitcoin price was that an announcement, today, of keeping US interest rates unchanged would allow bitcoin price to continue its rally.\n\nHowever, several hours before the Fed’s scheduled announcement, a sell-off gripped the market and destroyed the past week’s price advance in a single red candle.\n\nBTCC 1-Week and 1-Hour Charts\n\nAnalysis prior to the sell-off\n\nFrom the analysis pages of xbt.social, earlier today:\n\nLooking at the 1hr BTCC chart (right), we see that RSI (top) had diverged on the last high, and that this divergence was followed by a reverse divergence made to the downside. The combination implies another nominal price high, although it does not show in all exchange charts.\n\nRegardless, remember that price is at critical resistance – an annual high – at the same time as a major global economic announcement is due (Fed rates), so the market is unlikely to make progress until after the announcement (19h00 UTC) when the largest bitcoin players (investment funds) position in the market. That the bullish spirit to date has been mostly retail activity, i.e. ordinary exchange traders, is evident from the advance’s low volume that has also been contracting (blue arrow) as price advanced during the past week.\n\nThe 1-week chart (left) contains several warnings. This week’s candle has not yet closed, but the current conditions are:\n\n1) Price is above the December closing high, but RSI is diverging from the move. Unless there is an extraordinary, powerful surge to the upside, it seems unlikely that RSI can negate this divergence. The implication is a downward price correction, at least.\n\n2) Low (and contracting) volume reveals lack of wide participation. It is as if the largest investors are sitting out. Wonder why would they would do that, right?\n\n3) Despite a generally rising average price since February, the stochastics (circled in magenta) are accelerating to toward their minimum.\n\nSummary\n\nA sell-off pulled bitcoin price out of the zone from where it could continue into parabolic advance based on a dovish Fed rates statement. However, the market may return to advance after completion of the unexpectedly deep correction. Traders should wait for the Fed announcement and the market’s reaction to this significant news.\n\nBitfinex Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin-price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', ""This popular article and its infographic, originally published on November 15, 2015, have been updated by Michael Gord to reflect the major developments since then in the world of Bitcoin and blockchain. In the fall of 2015, BitPay and BTC Media (parent company of Bitcoin Magazine) commissioned Josh Dykgraaf, an artist based in Amsterdam who specializes in 3D and photo illustrations, to design an infograph as a guide to navigating the emerging Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem. The infographic has been so popular, and the growth in the ecosystem so dynamic, that BTC Media commissioned Dykgraaf to create an updated poster which made its debut in March at SXSW®, and is available as a digital download (JPEG, PDF) or printed copy.\n\nOn January 3, 2009, the Genesis block, or the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain, was created. In the coinbase parameter, there was a simple message: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” From that one block, Bitcoin was born.\n\nBitcoin has come a long way from that initial statement by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. The technology is growing up and changing, from its early days as a project adopted by impassioned technologists and libertarians to a technology widely researched and used by financial institutions worldwide.\n\nBitcoin had a rough road ahead of it, as did many early technologies, including the Internet. It dealt with newspaper headlines lambasting Bitcoin because of its connection to Silk Road and drugs. Early adopters suffered millions of dollars in losses when early exchange Mt. Gox imploded. “Bitcoin is Dead,” many prophesied.\n\nAnd yet, as Bitcoin approaches its eighth birthday, we see things changing. It is turning into that curious, wide-eyed technology with ideas as widespread as any normal eight-year-old. Cross-border payments, machine-to-machine transactions, smart contracts, microtransactions and stock settlements all have been discussed and developed. Nothing is off limits; no question goes unasked.\n\nFrom the early days of mining using a laptop computer, now Bitcoin miners have industrial-sized data centers with hundreds of thousands of high-powered, specialized machines. In January 2014, the Bitcoin network hashrate was only 10 million GH/s. Today, it is more than 1 billion GH/s and growing quickly as new mining machines are built and sold. Around January 2014, there were around 50,000 Bitcoin transactions daily. That measure of network utility has increased to more than 200,000 Bitcoin transactions daily.\n\nA big part of this growth in transactions is linked to the growth in Bitcoin-accepting merchants. In mid-2014, there were approximately 65,000 merchants who accepted Bitcoin. Now, there are more than 100,000, which represents a 50 percent increase. TigerDirect, a publicly traded online electronics retailer, has seen incredible results. Of all the buyers that used Bitcoin, 46 percent of them were brand new to TigerDirect. Further, orders placed with Bitcoin were 30 percent larger.\n\nBitPay, a Bitcoin payment processor, also has seen a significant increase in volume. It announced in a blog post written at the beginning of 2016 that it has experienced a transactional increase of 50 percent in the last two months and an increase of 110 percent in the past 12 months. BitPay also saw record-breaking months for Bitcoin transactions in November and December of 2015, with more than 100,000 BitPay invoices processed each month. BitPay explains in the post, “At these rates, every 25 seconds a shopper somewhere in the world was spending Bitcoin at a BitPay merchant.” In Latin America, total transactions were up 1,747 percent in 2015. Bitcoin as a tool of transaction is growing.\n\nBitcoin as an asset class is also maturing. For the majority of 2015, the price stayed relatively nonvolatile and constant, fluctuating between $200 and $300. It was only toward the end of 2015 that the price experienced a significant increase, reminiscent of the early years, to finish the year as the world’s top performing currency (down from -67 percent in 2014 to +35 percent in 2015). From January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2014, the price went from $13.41 to $808.05, going as high as $1,147.25 on December 4. Just one month earlier, on November 4, 2013, the price was $225.20. Even the “bubbles” in Bitcoin are maturing. On the other hand, the market cap of Bitcoin is down from an all-time high of nearly $14 billion to around $6.5 billion at the time of writing.\n\nVenture capital funding continues to pour into the space. In 2013, Bitcoin companies raised only $93.8 million. In 2014, firms raised $314.7 million. In 2015, Bitcoin and blockchain companies raised more than $1 billion.\n\nRegulations are also changing. Before, there were politicians decrying Bitcoin because of its use on the underground marketplace Silk Road. Now, organizations such as Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce work to help these politicians and regulators draft rules that will ensure Bitcoin can continue to grow worldwide. New York has led the regulatory charge with its recent BitLicense initiative. The European Union also recently ruled that Bitcoin was not subject to VAT, providing significant clarity for those participating in the ecosystem.\n\nFinally, the development of blockchain companies and enterprise solutions continues to grow. In 2015, Bitcoin and blockchain enterprise development generated over $1 billion in capital investments, with the first quarter of the year surpassing the total amount of funding for the entire previous 12 months. To date, more than 65 banks and financial institutions have made investments in the industry, and businesses in diverse fields ranging from health care to insurance to global supply chain trade networks have entered the arena.\n\nThe year 2016 has seen Augur, a decentralized prediction market, announce that it had raised $5.1 million in a crowdsale. Ethereum, the smart contract and publishing platform, raised $18.4 million in its own crowdsale. It is expected that OpenBazaar, the completely decentralized peer-to-peer ecommerce site, will launch in the coming months. Blockchain technology is rapidly ushering in a new world of data integrity that will impact industry and commerce on a magnitude comparable to the dawning of the Internet.\n\nBitcoin is not just on the fringes anymore; it is becoming mainstream. Whether it's miners, payment processors, wallets, developer tools, large-enterprise blockchain solutions or innovative new fintech accelerators, the reality is simple. Bitcoin and its blockchain are growing up. And the future they are opening to the world is as vast as that unlocked by any of the greatest technologies in history."", 'National Bitcoin ATM has installed a new BTM in Las Vegas, precisely at 107 E Charleston Boulevard in North Las Vegas. The machine is open 24/7 and allows only to buy Bitcoin.\n\nThis ATM is located in the main corridor of the Arts Factory, accessible through the Downtown Crown Pub entrance.\n\n“The majority of Bitcoin ATM customers seem to have an appetite for purchasing Bitcoin more than selling”, commented a spokeperson.\n\nHow to use National Bitcoin ATM\n\nTo get started using the Bitcoin ATM all you need is to provide a mobile phone number. The maximum limit for buying is $2,500.\n\nA spokeperson explains to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Buying Bitcoin at a National Bitcoin ATM takes only a few minutes to complete from start to finish. The experience is great and the machine walks you through the whole process.”\n\nNational Bitcoin ATM has 10 machines around the whole North America and in the future the company plans to install more ATMs.\n\nWhy decentralized currency is better\n\nAn interesting thing to note is the ATM location, as the wall behind it is covered with an infographic created by HolyTransaction.\n\nHolytransaction is a multi-currency wallet that provides access to the most popular digital currencies: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Blackcoin, Dash, Peercoin, ThetherUS, Ethereum and Gridcoin.\n\nThe infographic, entitled “Why is decentralized currency better?”, presents the most important benefits of the Bitcoin use.\n\nFrancesco Simonetti, HolyTransaction CEO, comments:', ""Decentralized financial system, Stellar, invites the members of the Bitcoin community to claim their cryptocurrency, Lumens. With around 19 billion Lumens being distributed in multiple rounds to anyone based on the quantity of Bitcoin they have, people can start claiming their Lumens on July 5, 2016.\n\nDue to restrictions, the program is closed to the residents of New York, Georgia, New Hampshire, Connecticut and any countries on the U.S Sanctions list such as Iran, Cuba, and North Korea.\n\nStellar itself is a network which, unlike regular blockchains, uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol \u200b(SCP) based on the federated Byzantine agreement instead of traditional mining. This speeds up the transactions process to within seconds while traditional Bitcoin transactions take roughly 15 minutes.\n\n“The Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) provides a way to reach consensus without relying on a closed system to accurately record financial transactions. SCP has a set of provable safety properties that optimize for safety over liveness—in the event of partition or misbehaving nodes, it halts progress of the network until consensus can be reached. SCP simultaneously enjoys four key properties: decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust, and asymptotic security. It is different than mining. There are tradeoffs to each.” explained Jed McCaleb, co-founder of the Stellar Development Foundation.\n\nStellar transactions\n\n“We believe in community\xad-based ownership of the Stellar network and want early digital currency enthusiasts such as Bitcoin holders to feel at home in the Stellar community.” said McCaleb.\n\nLumens are the cryptocurrency which makes Stellar transactions possible but it is a “behind-the-scenes” currency and there will be a supply increase of 1% each year, stated McCaleb. Even though Lumens are still used for transactions, Stellar allows buyers to create transactions in their choice of currency such as the US dollar and Bitcoin.\n\nMcCaleb explains Stellar contracts:\n\n“Smart contracts in Stellar have a somewhat different model. The core protocol provides primitives and constraints but the logic lies mainly outside the system. It is somewhat analogous to the way the lightning network works, it handles many transactions outside the system so people don't have to know about transactions they don't care about and it only resorts to the blockchain to settle disputes or close the channel. “We tried to enable a similar thing with smart contracts in Stellar, to keep the bulk of the computation outside the system but still allow people to make things that behave in predictable but complex ways.”\n\nHow to claim\n\nStellar will be setting up a claims page in July with 3 billion Lumens available so those who are interested in their acquisition can then deposit them into a Stellar account. A verification process will also be in effect to verify that you own and control the Bitcoin address you submit.\n\nAccording to McCaleb the first round of Lumen distribution will end on October 5, 2016 and any unclaimed Lumens will go into the platform’s operational fund.\n\n“Visit the claim page (link to come), which will walk you through the simple process. If you have an account on an exchange, check with your exchange to see if they're planning to participate. We'll update this post with a list of participating exchanges. The retrieval process for lumens will vary by exchange.” wrote McCaleb\n\nBitcoin holders can even participate if they have accounts on any participating exchanges commencing July 5th. If you are an exchange or a business with a pool of Bitcoins for customers, email the Stellar team at: [email protected] from your business email to acquire Lumens for distribution among your users.\n\nThere is no information about the next round of distribution and this will be decided after the completion of first round."", 'Infosys will become the latest IT services giant to announce the introduction of a blockchain offering through its EdgeVerve Systems subsidiary today at its Infosys Confluence conference in San Francisco.\n\nCalled the EdgeVerve Blockchain Framework, the product is aimed at furthering the adoption of blockchain tech in the financial services sector. Built on a permissioned distributed ledger, Infosys said the product will allow banks to ""rapidly deploy"" blockchain services, among other benefits.\n\nIn promotional materials, EdgeVerve described the distributed ledger platform as asset-agnostic, highly extensible and best suited for “minimizing operating and per-transaction costs for financial services”.\n\nThe company continued:\n\n""Designed specifically for the banking sector, it can scale to the levels needed to support international, cross-border transactional business. These capabilities make applications built on this framework a viable platform to run payments and other high volume transactional banking services.""\n\nAndy Dey, president of customer and operations at EdgeVerve, said the company will now invest resources at a research facility in Ireland toward the project, and begin working to leverage it with “several” unnamed institutional partners.\n\nEdgeVerve said it is already working on proofs-of-concept centered on digital vaults, invoice processing, payments, smart contracts, syndicated loans and trade finance.\n\nThe announcement comes weeks after Infosys first went public with its thesis on the technology. At the time, domain leaders at the company argued they believe that, despite claims to the contrary, blockchain systems will begin to impact finance in the next few years.\n\nWith the platform, Infosys joins Microsoft, IBM and Red Hat as one of a growing number of IT giants seeking to garner business in the now burgeoning market for enterprise blockchain solutions.\n\nEdgeVerve image via Facebook\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

04/28/2016,"['Valve has partnered with Bitcoin payment service Bitpay to bring everyone\'s favorite cryptocurrency to games platform Steam. Bitpay says it was approached by the company because it wanted to internationalize its operation, making it easier for Steam users in emerging markets to to buy games without using a credit card.\n\n""While more users are coming online in these countries, traditional payment options like credit cards often aren\'t available,"" said Bitpay in a blog post. ""As the internet\'s universal currency, Bitcoin will allow Steam to easily reach gamers in every market around the world — without the high fees or the risk of chargeback fraud that come with card payments.""\n\nWhile it\'s true that many gamers in emerging countries might not have easy access to a credit or debit card, it\'s perhaps not fair to say that Bitcoin is completely without risk. But while fluctuating currency values and hacked wallets continue to make the cryptocurrency a risky option for the uninitiated, Bitcoin should at least be able to handle that one-off purchase of Rocket League (the only Steam game you really need right now).', 'Digital Currency Group is busy these days. In the last four months alone, the company acquired the biggest bitcoin news site, CoinDesk, and along with it, the biggest bitcoin conference, Consensus; it also gave money to Coin Center, the bitcoin industry\'s nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nOn Thursday, DCG announced a laundry list of new investors and additions to its team, and among them is one very big name: Larry Summers.\n\n\n\nSummers, former Treasury secretary and former president of Harvard University, is joining DCG as a senior advisor. It is a reminder that Summers believes in the future of bitcoin, the crypto-currency that many fare still skeptical about. One year ago, speaking at the Museum of American Finance, Summers was asked about bitcoin and said, ""We have seen so little innovation cumulatively directed at taking the frictional costs out of the system. The notion that there’s going to be a lot of innovation and experimentation around how those frictional costs can be taken out feels like a very important kind of idea.”\n\n\n\nDigital Currency Group is an investment firm that has poured money into 72 different companies, more than two-thirds of which operate in the bitcoin space. A small portion of DCG\'s portfolio are companies exploring blockchain technology without bitcoin, so DCG calls itself a digital currency firm, not solely a bitcoin firm. (What is the blockchain? Watch our helpful primer video.) But it is associated primarily with bitcoin. DCG\'s portfolio boasts almost all of the hottest bitcoin startups, and those startups have accounted for more than 70% of all the venture capital put into bitcoin companies in total.\n\n\n\nThe CEO of DCG is Barry Silbert, who in 2004 created SecondMarket, which allowed for the trading of private-company stock, and in 2015 sold it to Nasdaq (NDAQ). In DCG\'s release about its news, Summers says, ""Barry and his team at DCG are building an important platform with great potential to help these technologies reach mass adoption.”\n\nIn the past, I have called DCG the Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) of the bitcoin world, but you could just as easily compare it to Barry Diller\'s acquisitive InterActiveCorp (IAC), and indeed, Silbert says that DCG models itself after IAC and Berkshire Hathaway. (CoinDesk was DCG\'s first full acquisition, but expect more to come.) The addition of Summers, along with its new investors, supports the comparisons.\n\nIn addition to bringing on Summers and respected bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen as advisors, DCG has raised a new funding round (it will not disclose the amount) from Western Union (WU), Prudential (PRU) through its investment subsidiary Gibraltar, FoxConn through its investment subsidiary HCM International, and others.\n\nBut it is the involvement of Summers that may turn some heads on Wall Street. Silbert knows the value of the name. ""I\'ve gotten to know Dr. Summers over the past few years,"" Silbert tells Yahoo Finance, ""and it has been fantastic to see his thinking about digital currency and blockchain evolve and mature.""\n\nWhat Silbert and DCG and the rest of the bitcoin industry are hoping is that the general attitude toward bitcoin will continue to mature.\n\n--\n\nDaniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering sports business and technology.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow big banks are paying lip service to the blockchain\n\nHere’s how you can invest in the blockchain\n\nBitcoin\'s biggest investor just bought its biggest news site\n\nHere\'s a sign that PayPal is embracing Bitcoin', ""With the increasing adoption of Bitcoin, cypherpunks have once again risen to prominence.\n\nAs Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd, self-proclaimed cypherpunks, and Adam Back, the inventor of Hashcash, pave a path for Bitcoin, their vision highlights a cautious approach in an attempt to not repeat the mistakes of the 90s.\n\nAre they right or are they about to repeat the precise mistakes they wish to avoid?\n\nEmbracing Bitcoin\n\nGregory Maxwell, one of the five core Bitcoin developers until recently, revealed in a post two months ago that he and Todd had a long history with Bitcoin.\n\nMaxwell says:\n\n“In 2001 Peter Todd was outlining the primary challenges (search spend-twice) in the construction of a Bitcoin like system with Hal Finney and Adam Back; in 2004 I was using and collaborating with Hal on the RPOW reusable proof of work system.”\n\nWhile Finney was the first to embrace Bitcoin, neither Todd nor Maxwell are known to have communicated with Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nDebate over Bitcoin’s scalability\n\nOver the past year the duo has been at the forefront of an intense debate over Bitcoin’s scalability. The differences, surprisingly, seem minimal.\n\nA question of “timing and priority”, says Gavin Andresen, who is of the opinion that Bitcoin should primarily scale on-chain in the short term.\n\nGregory Maxwell disagrees, stating in a post that “the decentralized Bitcoin blockchain is probably the most insanely inefficient mode of communication ever devised by man.”\n\nSome suggest that this may be a narrow view, looking at the code only, rather than its wider effects, such as potentially replacing bank branches or employees. Nonetheless, every node has to store and communicate every transaction.\n\nThe use of layer two systems\n\nThe idea is to slow down demand on nodes by the use of layer two systems, such as Lightning.\n\nAccording to Maxwell, from its very beginning Bitcoin was design to incorporate layers in secure ways through its smart contracting capability.\n\nIn effect we will use the Bitcoin system as a highly accessible and perfectly trustworthy robotic judge and conduct most of our business outside of the court room.\n\nHe continues by saying that this is possible precisely because of the core properties of Bitcoin.\n\nA censorable or reversible base system is not very suitable to build powerful upper layer transaction processing on top of and if the underlying asset isn't sound, there is little point in transacting with it at all.\n\nThings that need fixing\n\nEric Lombrozo, the main developer of segwit, an important component for Lightning, states in reply to a number of our questions:\n\n“[W]e don't want to keep transaction capacity small - the problem here is that block space costs resources and adds load to the network. We'd prefer to move as much offchain as possible but we would also like to increase on-chain capacity as much as the network can bear without sacrificing security, privacy, decentralization, etc...and there are things that need fixing so we can really do this well.”\n\nLombrozo concludes that on-chain capacity determines how many users can join the network whereas offchain protocols allow these same users to transact without costing the network almost anything.\n\nSlowing down the blockchain growth\n\nBitcoin’s blockchain currently stands at around 70GB, increasing by 5GB a month. As capacity will increase in the next few months, in the short term it may grow by 100GB a year. Leading to Satoshi’s conclusion that nodes would be run on servers.\n\nThere are many technical solutions, such as pruning or sharding or Lightning which may delay such eventuality as lower value transactions, some 70,000 daily for less than $5 according to Rusty Russel, move to the Lightning Network.\n\nCypherpunks’ focus is to slow down the blockchain growth, but it is not clear how the inevitable conclusion of Satoshi that nodes would be run on servers can be avoided.\n\nThe blockchain may be 200GB next year, at which point it is likely already too inconvenient for most. It will then continue to grow by 100GB a year.\n\nThus one can easily extrapolate, as Satoshi did, that in 5 or 10 years it is unlikely anyone would be running a node on a laptop even if the blocksize is forever kept at 2 or 4MB.\n\nA lack of vision\n\nIn our three-day research we were unable to find Cypherpunks’ long term vision of how Bitcoin will operate in 10 or 20 years – a lack of vision which may have contributed to the intensity of last year’s debate.\n\nAlthough they emphasize nodes should not be run on data-centers, we could not find any articulation of how that can be avoided in the long term.\n\nInstead, the focus seems to be on keeping the blockchain as small as possible, for as long as possible so as to ensure that running a node, either on a laptop or server, is as cheap as possible with no clear end game if, say, a country adopted Bitcoin.\n\nIn contrast, Satoshi clearly seems to have thought that software is cheap and technology keeps improving.\n\nTherefore, although investment to run a node may be required, it would be affordable.\n\nThus, Bitcoin would remain decentralized as long as there is demand for its use as service providers would be incentivized to invest in nodes."", 'Anyone who has been a long-time user of Coinbase knows that the cryptocurrency startup hasn’t exactly always made it easy to buy Bitcoin.\n\nIn the early days you had to link your U.S bank account, verify it via two small deposits, and still wait up to five days for the Bitcoin to be sent to your wallet each time you made a purchase. Then, the company added instant purchases (which allowed you to receive the Bitcoin immediately), but only if you had a credit card linked to the account as a backup payment method.\n\nBut today that has finally changed, as the company announced that instant buys from debit cards are now available to all users in the United States.\n\nThis is a big deal, mainly because of the increasing amount of consumers in the U.S who solely rely on debit cards. And since waiting 3-5 days to receive Bitcoin kind of defeats the purpose of buying it at all, many consumers shied away from Coinbase’s platform, turning instead to companies like Circle.\n\nFor the privilege of using your debit card, Coinbase will charge a 3.75% fee, compared to the 1% fee they charge for purchases funded by your bank account. In addition, the company is requiring all users who use debit cards to verify their identity before making their first purchase.\n\nOne more downside; the company will be limiting debit card purchases to just $250 worth of Bitcoin per day, compared to $10,000 per day when using your bank account.\n\nBut even with the additional verification and low purchase limits, the acceptance of debit cards should still lead to a flood of new users signing up to purchase Bitcoin on the platform.\n\nThe company says the feature is coming to other countries soon, although most European users have been able to use a debit card on Coinbase since late last summer.', 'BTC-e, a European exchange, has added bitcoin-based trading pairs on Ethereum and Dash, extending the trading possibilities for these coins, according to Finance Magnates. Ethereum and Dash are the second and fifth largest cryptocurrencies, respectively, based on market capitalization.\n\nBTC-e caters to retail forex traders. Through a partnership with FXOpen, a forex broker, BTC-e was the first exchange to offer cryptocurrency trades using the MetTrader 4 platform.

While it is evident Bitcoin can easily sneak around any artificial wall, Mexican Bitcoin startup Bitso raised US$1.85m to provide better remittance solutions.\n\nBitso Makes Trump Bite the Dust\n\nAttacking the remittance payment industry is never a smart idea, and Donald Trump will come to that realization at some point in his life. Arguing how the remittance corridor between the US and Mexico needs to be shut down is not the smartest thing he has ever said, but there are plenty of solutions to solve this problem.\n\nBitso, a Bitcoin to Mexican Peso exchange, which uses the popular cryptocurrency to let Mexicans freely trade dollars and pesos in and out of Bitcoin. This is made possible due to the startup’s partnership with the Mexican Central Bank, which makes this conversion process a breeze. Ever since Donald Trump made his infamous statement, Bitso has seen an increasing demand for their services.\n\nThat is only normal, considering a lot of migrant Mexican workers in the US send money back to friends and family at home. However, they are forced to do using some of the most expensive remittance solutions in the world, as the average money transfer fee is 9.11%. It is important to keep in mind this number does not even include conversion costs, making traditional financial solutions a less-than-favorable solution to send money abroad.\n\nBitso CEO Pablo Gonzalez told the media:\n\n“Mexico is home to the endpoint of the largest remittance corridor in the world, with a flow of over $25.4 billion in 2015. We believe that Mexicans should be able to send their money back home, and Bitcoin is fast becoming a cheaper and faster way to do that as our platform volume increases. We feel making money flow freely is a great innovation that should not be hindered by traditional currency wars”\n\nAs a result of this growing demand for Bitso services, the startup decided to raise additional funding on the BnkToTheFuture platform. So far, they have been quite successful, as slightly over US$1.85m has been raised for this campaign. BnkToTheFuture is a platform where everyone in the world can invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum projects and startups, in exchange for company equity [and future dividends].\n\nThere is a growing demand for Bitcoin remittance services around the world, and companies like Bitso can show the others how business should be conducted. After all, they are one of the very few Bitcoin companies with a direct integration to the bank clearing system, allowing the conversion and clearing of funds in mere seconds.\n\nSource: Press Release Via Email\n\nHeader image courtesy of Bitso', ""The biggest digital currency named Bitcoin is quite famous these days, not only because of its magical way of sending money without the help of any third parties, but also for its involvement in cyber crimes.\n\nIt is often regarded as something amazingly innovative with the potential to disrupt the financial system that we know today, and it is also something that attracts interest — or in some cases, causes distress — of investors and economists from all over the world.\n\nBill Gates on Bitcoin\n\nDuring his “Ask Me Anything” session on Reddit platform, Bill Gates mentioned Bitcoin as “an exciting new technology,” adding that he was planning to use digital currency for his foundation to help the poor get banking services.\n\nBut not long after, he also explained why he dicided not to use Bitcoin.\n\nBill Gates says about the reasons:\n\n“One is that the poor shouldn't have a currency whose value goes up and down a lot compared to their local currency. Second, is that if a mistake is made in who you pay then you need to be able to reverse it so anonymity wouldn't work.”\n\nMainstream Media vs. Bitcoin community\n\nOscar Darmawan, CEO Bitcoin Indonesia (bitcoin.co.id), says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“BitcoinQuotation.com paves in to become a reliable source for you to learn about what these highly influential people think about Bitcoin and whether the blockchain technology can become something that will change the world entirely like how Internet once did, or fail miserably, stomping on people’s hopes and beliefs.”\n\nThere are two sides of each coin, they said, and BitcoinQuotation.com shows exactly that.\n\nThe community sees Bitcoin as something magical—something that can start a revolution against the centralized system we have today.\n\nOn another hand, the press just loves to accentuate Bitcoin’s affiliation with the deep web, ransomware, or money laundering. But only one question remains. Which side are you on?\n\nWhat is BitcoinQuotation.com?\n\nUnderstanding is the key and through BitcoinQuotation.com, you can learn how great Bitcoin is while also embracing its flaws.\n\nFrom the Winklevoss twins’ inspiring quote, to Warren Buffet’s mean criticism, or even to Lily Allen’s funny little tweet about Bitcoin, you can read it all in here.\n\nAnd like Tim Draper, investor and the founder of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, once said, “It’s better to be the one encouraging the changing of our own industry than to be the one who gets surprised by it.”\n\nGet inspired for the Bitcoin revolution\n\nSo, are you ready to hop on the Bitcoin train and join the revolution or will you stay strong and satisfied with the current financial system?

With a user interface that requires users to send money to long strings of letters and numbers rather than human-readable names, it’s no wonder that many individuals have a hard time figuring out how to use this new financial technology.\n\nBIP 70 (Payment Protocol), which was authored by Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen and former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn, has been a step in the right direction, but the relatively new BIP 75, which was co-authored by developers from Netki (Justin Newton and Matt David) and Breadwallet (Aaron Voisine and James MacWhyte), takes the main ideas in BIP 70 one step further.\n\nWhat is the Payment Protocol?\n\nThe Payment Protocol creates a method of communication between a merchant and their customers before a payment is made. This communication protocol allows customers to see human-readable payment destinations, which can be authenticated via digital signatures. The protocol also creates a proof-of-payment for the customer, and it automatically provides a refund address to the merchant from the customer’s wallet.\n\nThis version of the Payment Protocol has been helpful in creating a checkout process for merchants that is similar to other options on traditional point-of-sale systems.\n\nHow Does BIP 75 Improve Upon the Payment Protocol?\n\nOne of the main downfalls of BIP 70 is that it doesn’t work well for P2P payments. While it gets the job done for transactions between a customer and a merchant, Bitcoin wallets are unable to receive payment requests when they’re offline. Store-and-forward servers can be used to forward new payment requests to wallets when they come online, but this setup creates new privacy and security concerns. BIP 75 is an attempt to solve this issue by encrypting all communication in the Payment Protocol end to end.\n\n“By adding encryption at the application layer we create secure private communications, even in the case where there is a store and forward server for mobile or desktop wallets,” Netki founder and CEO Justin Newton, who co-authored BIP 75, told Bitcoin Magazine. “This additional encryption also protects the users in the case that the transport layer security is compromised.”\n\nBIP 75 also allows the sender of a payment to create a cryptographically-signed invoice request for the receiver. This enables the receiver to validate the identity of the sender before they release an address in the returned payment request. Then, the receiver sends the encrypted payment request back to the sender.\n\nNetki Senior Software Engineer and BIP 75 co-author Matt David clarified the differences in digital signature usage between BIP 70 and BIP 75 for Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“A digital signature exists only in the Payment Request message portion of the BIP 70 process, and therefore, the signature is only from the receiver. In BIP 75, there are digital signatures from both parties (via certificate signatures) as well as message signatures from each side to prove ownership of the messaging keys, which are used to calculate the encryption key for the Payment Protocol transaction.”\n\nThe human-readable names used in this updated version of the Payment Protocol make the entire payment process much more user-friendly. Personal logs of transactions are also improved because the names of people from past transactions are stored in a log rather than just a list of random Bitcoin addresses.\n\nWallet Names\n\nThe Wallet Names discussed in BIP 75 would allow users to store static domain-style names, such as kyle.bitcoinmagazine.com. This enables what essentially amounts to address books in Bitcoin wallets. Wallet names can be mapped to BIP 32 wallets, which means users can use a single address for all payments without compromising on privacy. A new Bitcoin address is generated for each payment to avoid address reuse.\n\nIn terms of how Wallet Names are mapped to Bitcoin addresses in this system, Newton told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“Wallet Names can point to a web address where the sending wallet can retrieve a unique address per transaction via a BIP 21 formatted response, or can initiate a BIP 75 Payment Protocol transaction, resulting in a signed Payment Request (including a unique address) generated by the receiving wallet.”\n\nWith this BIP implemented, Bitcoin wallets will look less like the early days of the Internet and more like modern payment applications such as Venmo.\n\nThanks to Netki Senior Software Engineer and BIP 75 co-author Matt David and Netki COO Dawn Newton for reviewing this article for technical accuracy.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011. His work has been featured on VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, RT’s Keiser Report and many other media outlets. You can follow @kyletorpey on Twitter.', 'There’s a lot of discussion surrounding the utilization of distributed ledger technology within the traditional financial services industry, and how the combination of regulation and digital identity will work to shape these systems moving forward.\n\nGiven Netki’s involvement in these discussions and projects, I wanted to share some thoughts on why I think the establishment of a unified digital identity management system and the utilization of distributed ledger technology within the regulated financial services industry presents such an exciting opportunity, and highlight the significant challenges that need to be overcome in order to move past the computer-science experiments, and into the real-world deployment of in market applications.\n\nBanks, Distributed Ledgers, & Bitcoin\n\nIn their March, 2016 Global FinTech Report, PricewaterhouseCoopers found that while a majority of their respondents (56% of C-level FS executives in a global survey) recognize the “importance” of blockchain technology, most (57%) still say they are unlikely to respond to the trend at this time. Moreover, very few considered themselves to be “experts” on the tech, with 83% of respondents categorizing themselves as only “moderately familiar”.\n\n“This lack of understanding may lead market participants to underestimate the potential impact of blockchain on their activities.”\n\nStill, even in this ‘wait and see’ environment, a number of financial institutions have signed on to initiatives, such as R3CEV (over 40 banks, including Citi, Wells, Barclays, CBA, and others) and The Hyperledger Project (FIs like J.P. Morgan, BNY Mellon, and State Street), that aim to use distributed ledger technology to replace certain systems/processes, in an effort to cut costs and ‘disrupt’ themselves from within.\n\nThe general idea, as Richard Brown, R3CEV CTO puts it, “is to move from each firm having its own systems of record to having systems of record at the level of the industry”.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, these systems will be ‘permissioned’ such that only certain actors can secure and/or access the network.\n\nWhy financial institutions are still looking at integrating with open networks like Bitcoin\n\nBefore delving into a discussion about the challenges and potential solutions associated with providing services that utilize open blockchain-based payments networks like Bitcoin, I first want to highlight some of the reasons why the technology presents FIs with such an exciting opportunity.\n\nWhile FIs have been most actively exploring the use of permissioned distributed ledger solutions to dramatically reinvent certain aspects of retail banking, it is unclear how this will impact (if at all), their ability to provide services, such as cheaper, faster payments in currently underserved markets (largely in the developing world).\n\nIt’s easy to get identity info from your own customers, and correspondent banking allows financial service providers to ‘know’ the customers of other institutions that they have a relationship with. But without the ability to easily perform proper customer due diligence on parties at the remote end of transactions (those who are either unbanked, or use an institution outside of the sending institution’s corresponding network), these kind of transfers are ultimately too risky and/or costly to present commercial banks with a viable business opportunity.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, they still need to ‘know’ something about the recipients at the remote end of ‘high risk’ transfers, and even if certain processes can be streamlined through the use of shared, distributed ledgers, it only helps those who already have access to FIs that act as “shared ledger providers”.\n\nThis is not to say that Bitcoin can act as some sort of “silver bullet” for the establishment of formal financial services in underserved markets. Challenges surrounding scaling still need to be overcome, and top down approaches to ‘banking the unbanked with Bitcoin’ that fail to properly assess and understand the consumers and communities they are trying to reach, will likely leave Bitcoin as a solution looking for a problem.\n\nWhile there are certainly challenges to overcome, we are already seeing how companies like Bitex.la in Argentina and BitPesa in Kenya have worked with, and learned from their customers/communities to provide solutions that solve real problems using Bitcoin (such as utilization of BTC as a type of intermediary currency for foreign currency exchange).\n\nStartups like these are paving the way for the type of bottom-up approach that lends itself to this kind of innovation, and the open nature of Bitcoin allows for the type of ‘permissionless’ innovation that can yield novel approaches to long-standing challenges.\n\nStill, there is a lot of room for a symbiotic relationship between Bitcoin and the legacy system: banking relationships remain critical for Bitcoin services that act as exchanges (BTC ?? Fiat), and smaller Bitcoin startups based in underserved markets have a leg up in their ability to more rapidly assess customer needs and adapt new technologies to suit their needs. Strategic partnerships between the two hold the potential to create a virtuous cycle in which both FIs and Bitcoin startups/technology providers can gain access to new (lucrative) business opportunities and (HUGE) customer bases that would have previously been highly difficult, and in some cases, impossible for either of them to break into on their own.\n\nFrom Max Tannahill, Business Change & Implementation Manager at ANZ:\n\n“Integrating consumer accounts with the ability to send and receive Bitcoin would immediately deliver benefits to users they will only seek out themselves when the technology becomes more widespread.”\n\n“Bitcoin may offer the realisation of the internet-specific method of payments envisaged in the original application protocol (the 402 code) for the World Wide Web, a need that will only increase as the world becomes increasingly connected. There is no way correspondent banking can handle this for users in a manner comparably efficient or secure.”\n\nIf the future of financial services involves a ‘platform’ model in which banks provide more “holistic solutions by tailoring their offerings to customer expectations”, we can start to see how the ability to digitally send value to anyone in the world on an open network like Bitcoin can play a role in the full realization of customer-centric banking solutions.\n\nWhy FIs Haven’t (Really) Experimented with Bitcoin (Yet)\n\nPutting things like brand image challenges and conspiracy theories aside, what characteristics of open payments networks like Bitcoin are currently incompatible with the highly regulated financial services industry?\n\nLicensed FIs have gained the de facto and de jure blessings of central banks, governments, and regulatory regimes to act as the effective gate-keepers for a financial system that fits in with “how government and law enforcement want money to move”. This includes strict adherence to AML/KYC regulations, which require FIs that act as ‘Money Transmitters’ to have a certain level of information about the ‘identities’ of each party to certain ‘high risk’ transactions.\n\nBitcoin allows users to transfer tokens of value to anyone, via their public wallet address. Transactions are confirmed by a ‘decentralized’ (in the sense that anyone who has the CPU powercan contribute) network of miners, and logged publicly (and permanently!) on the Bitcoin blockchain with the wallet address of each party to the transaction, the amount transferred, and the time it was posted.\n\nWhile the use of public wallet addresses (like 1CpLXM15vjULK3ZPGUTDMUcGATGR9xGitv), which carry no identifying information about their owner, help preserve the privacy of end-users whose transactions are posted on a permanent, public ledger, the ability for an individual using a Bitcoin wallet to send funds to any wallet address (without any other identifying info pertaining to ‘who’ the recipient is), places open payments networks like Bitcoin in direct conflict with certain reporting requirements for money service businesses, as prescribed in current AML/KYC regulations.\n\nEven if a Bitcoin wallet service KYC’s all of their own users, it is (currently) impossible for them to operate a completely open Bitcoin payment service, and be in full compliance with regulatory requirements, because the remote end of the transaction has not been identified.\n\nFrom PwC Director of Blockchain & Anaytics, Ajit Tripathi:\n\n“R3 and Bitcoin are not competitors. R3 are looking to offer alternate technical architectures for regulated financial markets whereas Bitcoin has been built for censorship resistance in an extreme environment of distrust (otherwise known as the internet).”\n\n“That begs the question. What does REALLY make Bitcoin unsuitable for regulated financial services. Is it anonymity? Is it censorship resistance? Something else?”\n\n“The flip question is... what\'s the ONE thing that underlies the foundation of modern, regulated financial services?”\n\n“That one thing is DIGITAL IDENTITY and here\'s why:\n\nFinance = Money = Distrust => It\'s All About The (Not Yet) Bad Guy”\n\nThis leads to an important conclusion: while Bitcoin has been built to facilitate open, peer to peer payments by keeping track of who has what through decentralized consensus, the Bitcoin blockchain alone cannot provide a record of ‘who’ that is compatible with how government and law enforcement want money to move.\n\nDistributed Ledgers & Digital Identity\n\nDigital Identity solutions allow FIs to ‘know’ certain things about the parties to transactions conducted online, and therefore comply with AML/KYC reporting requirements.\n\nAs Brown puts it:\n\n“[A] key theme is that we’re thinking about identity all wrong. Most of the time we think we need to know who somebody is, what we actually need to know is something about them:\n\nA bartender doesn’t need to know your name and your home address; they just need proof you’re over 18.\n\nA UK doctor doesn’t need to know what town you were born in to know if you’re entitled to free healthcare.\n\n… and so on""\n\nIn the regulated financial services industry, the particular info that FIs need to ‘know’ about their customers and the parties they transact with is dependent on, and corresponds directly with, the amount of ‘risk’ involved in the transactions initiated. This ID info must come from a ‘validated’ source, and be exchanged between parties (and their service providers) before transactions can take place.\n\nWhat constitutes a valid form of digital identity that can be used to by licensed FIs for this purpose?\n\nThe key here is that we’re talking about digital identity for the purpose of complying with legal requirements.\n\nIn order to comply with California state laws, bars/restaurants can only serve alcohol to individuals that are at least 21 years old. While a bartender only needs to know that I’m 21 or older to give me a drink, she must confirm this information by checking my legal, government issued ID. I can’t, for example, present a signed note from my parents that says “Hey, I’m 21!” or show them my birthday on my Facebook profile, and expect that to constitute legitimate proof about my age.\n\nThis type of ID validation is easy in person: a bar bouncer can always use a blacklight, scanner, etc. to determine that I’m presenting a valid, government issued ID, but how can you create the equivalent to this in purely digital environments?\n\nThe short answer is that for digital identity to be legally valid, it must establish non-repudiation, ie the data that it represents about a party can be inextricably linked to a physical identity that is recognized by the applicable legal framework:\n\n“The essence of Digital Identity is that it must provide the legal basis for asset ownership, accountability for liabilities, and dispute resolution in a civil or criminal court of law.”\n\nBreaking this down further with another example:\n\nAs part of an FI’s e-banking platform, they need to (for compliance purposes) know the name and address of everyone that participates in transactions. How can this data be authenticated in a way that can’t be tampered with, and is inextricably linked to physical, gov issued ID credentials? We see here that while “authentication and identification are interlinked, they are not the same thing”.\n\nThis brings us to the essence of what constitutes a valid digital identity. From the UK Government Office for Science Report on Distributed Ledger technology:\n\n“Authentication does not require that I know your identity but it does require that you provide me with a token that is inextricably linked to your identity.”\n\nIn addition to challenges surrounding the authentication of identity data for parties at the remote end of transactions, there are also serious privacy concerns surrounding how MSBs operating distributed ledger platforms can ensure that sensitive data, such as identity information, is not recorded on any type of permanent (in the case of Bitcoin - public) ledger, accessible to a group of actors with potentially competing interests.\n\nWith Bitcoin, we can imagine a system where ‘identity tokens’ are linked to users’ wallets, and transferable between parties over private, off-chain channels.\n\nThis addresses the challenges surrounding Bitcoin compatibility with regulated financial services in a couple of interesting/significant ways:\n\nMSBs no longer need to collect all of the data pertaining to the identity of parties at the remote end of transactions; and instead, only need to confirm that such parties have an applicable validated identity token. Example: Regs require Name, Address, and [something else] for crossborder transfers between $200-500 (US) ; A ‘level 1’ ID token validates that at least Name, Address, and [something else] have been authenticated. MSBs can allow their customers to transfer this amount to any Bitcoin wallet linked to a ‘level 1’ ID token.\n\nAuthentication of validated ID info pertaining to parties at the remote end of transactions that preserves end user privacy by keeping sensitive ID data off-chain\n\nAgain from the UK Report:\n\n“The opportunity in the digital environment, is to use and create much more powerful and robust identity management tools that provide authentication whilst protecting privacy. One such system is public key infrastructure (PKI) relying on a cryptographic standard called X.509. Organisations using PKI can federate in order to provide, share and potentially simplify the secure delivery of services or products.”\n\nBut there are still some important questions:\n\nWho can provide ID tokens that will meet the criteria of regulators/enforcement agencies?\n\nWhat technologies can be employed to inextricably link ID tokens to a person’s legal identity, in a way that credibly establishes non-repudiation? What methodologies can be used to transmit the required regulatory user data while ensuring privacy protection?\n\nFrom Brown:\n\n“What these concepts all have in common is that they have this idea of a “certifier” – somebody or something that:”\n\nIs trusted by the issuer\n\nTies something I have (my face or my blockchain address) to something I am (“over 18”, “a holder of a US bank account”, etc)\n\nIf you trust the certifier then you can trust that somebody proving ownership of the face or the address is over 18 and a holder of a US bank account, etc.”\n\nWe can gain some insight into how a digital identity provider in this context would need to operate to constitute this level of ‘trust’ from principles that govern traditional e-banking.\n\nFrom the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ‘Risk Management Principles for Electronic Banking’:\n\n“Banking organizations have begun to employ various techniques that help establish non-repudiation and ensure confidentiality and integrity of e-banking transactions such as digital certificates using a public key infrastructure (PKI).”\n\n“A bank may issue a digital certificate to a customer or counterparty to allow for their unique identification/authentication and reduce the risk of transaction repudiation.”\n\n“If a bank is to rely upon a 3rd party digital certificate to establish authenticity, it should confirm that the Certificate Authority, when issuing the certificate, used the same level of authentication that the bank would have used to authenticate the person.”\n\nNow we have a (high level) model for a digital identity system that would allow regulated financial institutions to utilize open blockchain-based networks like Bitcoin, rather than being forced to create a closed loop system in order to comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nMSBs no longer need to collect all of the data pertaining to the identity of parties at the remote end of transactions; and instead, only need to confirm that such parties have an applicable validated identity token. Trusted providers leverage established authentication standards to create legally valid, individual identity tokens Establishment of a standardized approach for private, off-chain transfer of identity tokens between relevant parties to a transaction Ideal approach would establish a standard protocol that allows for interoperability between a diverse set distributed ledger systems and service providers Ability to programmatically enforce compliance with regulatory requirements\n\n\n\nUnbundling the identification / validation process in this way allows for compliant transactions on open networks, in which users can send value to anyone (regardless of what wallet or bank they use), as long as the recipient’s Bitcoin address is linked to an applicable ID token. Moreover, by using an open, standards based approach that can adapted to any blockchain, such a system allows for interoperability between a network of ‘trusted certifiers’ (allowing for a distributed, competitive environment) and blockchain-based payment networks.\n\nIn order for something like this to be realized there will need to be a massive amount of collaboration between technology providers, auditing/consulting firms, regulators, supervisory bodies, and FIs. This will take time, but the dialogue is already in full swing, and a sound framework and significant infrastructure are already in development.']"
04/29/2016,"['IBM today announced a new framework for securely operating blockchain networks, as well as new services on the IBM Cloud that meet stringent regulatory and security requirements. According to the company, IBM has created essential new cloud services for tamper-proof, trusted blockchain networks.\n\n""Clients tell us that one of the inhibitors of the adoption of blockchain is concerns about security,"" said Jerry Cuomo, vice president of Blockchain, IBM. ""While there is a sense of urgency to pioneer blockchain for business, most organizations need help to define the ideal cloud environment that enables blockchain networks to run securely in the cloud.""\n\nIBM is launching several initiatives to address the security needs of clients, startups, and developers, including cloud services with the highest Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 and Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) in the industry to support the use of blockchain technology in government, financial services and healthcare.\n\n""Blockchain is a highly innovative and promising technology. However there are a lot of issues to be solved for enterprise systems,"" said Eiji Ueki, director and executive vice president of NTT DATA. ""IBM’s new blockchain cloud service is directly trying to address those issues. We believe this will help accelerate the maturation of blockchain technology.""\n\nIBM is offering new cloud services to help businesses quickly host secure, tamper-resistant networks and scale to thousands of users, including tamper-resistant storage of crypto keys and services to enable blockchain peers to run in protected environments to prevent leaks through shared memory or hardware. According to the company, the new cloud services achieve the ideal criteria for cloud-based blockchain networks by providing an auditable operating environment with comprehensive log data that supports forensics and compliance.\n\n""When considering a cloud environment for a blockchain network or in a regulated industry, organizations must ask the right questions because not all cloud environments are equally secure,"" Cuomo told Bitcoin Magazine. ""A trusted cloud environment is critical to many industry compliance requirements. To address this, IBM is launching new blockchain services on the IBM Cloud that can help organizations in industries such as banking, healthcare and government.”\n\nIBM is a premier member of Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project, a collaborative effort started in December to establish, build and sustain an open, distributed ledger platform that will satisfy a variety of use cases across multiple industries. ""The Linux Foundation believes a shared infrastructure that is open to critical inspection and collaboration will be pivotal in driving global adoption of blockchain for distributed ledgers,"" Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview.\n\nIn February, Bitcoin Magazine reported that IBM is making tens of thousands of lines of code available to the Hyperledger Project to help developers easily build secure distributed ledgers that can be used to exchange most anything of value. IBM is persuaded that Hyperledger could make blockchain-based services faster, more scalable and easier to use, and expects Hyperledger software to provide special advantages for owners of IBM hardware.\n\nNow, IBM intends to make it easier to use IBM’s code based on the Hyperledger Project in any environment, including its cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) Bluemix, and is offering Bluemix services to help developers quickly build applications. For application developers who want to get a blockchain environment running almost instantly and start building applications, the beta release of IBM’s blockchain on Bluemix provides access to the very latest Linux Hyperledger code, updated as the code continues to emerge.\n\n“Bluemix Services make it easy for Factom developers to work with IBM blockchain code,” said Paul Snow, chief architect of Factom. ""IBM is the single largest contributor to open source technology, and the Internet would not be what it is today without their contributions. Exploring blockchain technology with IBM is exciting, and our approaches are complementary. We are thrilled to see how they will help grow the industry.""\n\nFor organizations that need the flexibility to run blockchains on different cloud servers or devices, a signed, certified distribution of IBM’s code submission to the Hyperledger project is now available on Docker Hub, a cloud-based registry service for building and shipping application or service containers. Ongoing updates will provide new features, including dashboards, analytics, chat support and exclusive network services.', 'Bitcoin, still a financial technology in its infancy in terms of adoption, can seem mystical to some. Blockchain technology is unlike any other system currently powering currency, and as such is not properly understood by the public at large. To many, especially of the older generations, cryptocurrency can seem like magic, a trick of digital sorcery, and certainly not something upon which one would place their trust and life savings.\n\nTo aid in the understanding of cryptocurrency, I will attempt to explain Bitcoin through the allegory of a pre-electricity village, without referencing any modern technology.\n\nDecentralized transaction records\n\nOur hypothetical village has no centralized currency, and instead employs a simple barter system. The villagers, tired of the inefficiency of simple barter, but wary of a central bank issuing currency, adopt a decentralized accounting system around units of measurement called VillageCoin, and write down all transfers in a public ledger.\n\nRecord keepers\n\nWhen a citizen wishes to transfer an amount of VillageCoin to another, they write down the transaction on a piece of paper containing the sender, the recipient, the amount, and the date, and submit it into a large, secure ballot box for inclusion in the ledger. Volunteer record keepers, known henceforth simply as keepers process all transactions. Several keepers must sign off on a transaction before it can be included in the ledger in order to prevent fraud and mistakes. Transactions may also indicate a small amount of VillageCoin set aside for the keepers, with higher fees ensuring priority transactions are processed first.\n\nPublic ledger\n\nOnce confirmed by the keepers, all transactions are written onto scrolls which are then encased in glass. These are called blocks. Each block has etched on its head a shorthand summary of the transactions contained therein. These blocks are chained together and kept in the village’s public archives, so all transactions are permanently and publicly accessible.\n\nBack to Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin functions much in the same way as this fictional village’s accounting system. Transactions between addresses containing an amount and date are submitted to the network. Instead of physical record keepers, computing systems called miners process and confirm transactions. They are paid small transaction fees, and additionally claim new Bitcoin “mined” into the currency supply slowly over time (with a hard limit of 21 million). All transactions end up in data blocks, which then are chained together on the blockchain as permanent and public record.\n\nThe only key differences between Bitcoin and the fictional VillageCoin are the use of digital records instead of physical, transaction addresses not being tied to physical identity (no one necessarily knows who controls which address), transactions being instantaneous and easy rather than time-consuming and requiring physical materials for transcription, and Bitcoin being being a global currency (rather than being relegated to one small village).\n\nBitcoin isn’t so complicated after all\n\nWhen viewed through the lens of physical record-keeping, Bitcoin starts to make more sense to the average layperson. The concept of the blockchain, a public and decentralized leger, is the simple, natural conclusion of any desire to record any human activity long-term without a centralized governing body. If more understood the simple roots behind Bitcoin’s technological genius, currencies controlled by central banks would have been abandoned by now.', ""Bitcoin was originally thought to be fully anonymous and in its early days it probably was. However, as most moved from mining Bitcoin to buying, systemic entry points, or exchanges, sprang up.\n\nAs a ledger history was created, known addresses, often those belonging to Bitcoin exchanges, became, in effect, de-anonymising tools.\n\nFinancial regulation of Bitcoin exchanges\n\nWhen Bitcoin became more prominent and popular, regulators took enforcement action.\n\nThe community’s pushback secured no regulation of the protocol itself, but Bitcoin exchanges were forced to comply with numerous financial regulations.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin addresses are made of random letters and numbers, each address is unique. Once ownership of the address is revealed, everyone can see all the transactions it performed.\n\nIf, therefore, that address received or deposited to a known illegal or even undesirable (as regulators deem it) service provider, exchanges may freeze the account or deny service as well as perhaps or rather likely share data with third parties.\n\nIf all exchanges or service providers share their data with a central entity, then it may be possible to track most transactions with reasonable confidence as the centralized points (exchanges or service providers) shed light on what likely occurred when the transaction is onchain.\n\nRetaining privacy\n\nOne method to retain privacy is to use a new address every time a new transaction is made.\n\nHowever, one could easily assume such action was performed, especially if subsequent transactions re-inforce the assumption in one way or another.\n\nThere are mixing services, like coinjoin, which pools different amounts, mixes them all together and sends them off to different addresses, as well as other methods.\n\nHowever, would non-technical users be able or willing to spend time and effort into employing such methods?\n\nShould they, therefore, be incorporated in the protocol itself and if they are, how would regulators, which are currently engaged in an intense fight with Apple in the so-called crypto wars 2.0, react?\n\nMany companies, including Apple, are now employing end to end encryption and other cryptographic methods which provide full privacy for the masses.\n\nSending transactions off-chain\n\nFor Bitcoin, the answer is slightly more complex. Although methods have been suggested, such as Confidential Transactions or a Zerocash sidechain, some suggest that sending transactions off-chain to the Lightning Network may be the answer.\n\nIn a short interview Peter Todd states:\n\n“The Lightning Network inherently means that less information about transactions ends up in the public blockchain, which makes anti-privacy coin tracking efforts like Chainalysis much less effective; Chainalysis is a perfect example of a company whose business will likely be wiped out entirely by Lightning.”\n\nAs most transactions would occur off-chain, there would be no global ledger of transactions to track. However, it is not clear how much privacy within Lightning transactions would provide as Lombrozo states that it is not yet decided what algorithm Lightning will use.\n\nLombrozo says:\n\n“You could use onion routing (like tor) so that hubs don't know the original source and destination. If you directly connect to the counterparty then you could use encrypted messages and nobody but the two of you would know about any of your transactions.” However, onion routing has trade-offs as “it tends to be slow and relatively inefficient.”\n\nRouting algorithms\n\nWhile tor is a valuable tool, it has seen little adoption, primarily because it is slow. Moreover, many websites have taken action to deny access to tor users, thus increasing inconvenience.\n\nIt may well be the case therefore that “several different routing algorithms will be used for different purposes” with most, probably, using the Firefox version of Lightning and the tor onion routing version.\n\nThis ensures privacy for those who spend time and effort, comparable to the use of the inconvenient PGP tool today.\n\nThe level of privacy for the rest, if any, is unclear with some suggesting that as scale is achieved, Lightning hubs would be able to see all transactions, comparable to exchanges and like exchanges can deny service if they so wish."", 'Timo Hanke, a mathematical researcher and cryptocurrency expert, in collaboration with Sergio Demian Lerner, a renowned security expert, has developed a new Bitcoin mining method that can increase mining revenue by up to 20 percent, translating to an increase of $30 million in annual profits if used by one of the biggest mining pools.\n\nThe patent pending method available for licensing “involves a new design of the SHA 256 hash-engines (inside the ASIC) and an additional pre-processing step as part of the mining software (outside the ASIC)” according to the whitepaper. Through parallel processing, it re-uses “outputs that would otherwise be created and discarded on a continuous basis.” Furthermore, it achieves gains on top of other optimizations such as “timing, pipelining, path balancing, custom cell and full custom designs.”\n\nThe new technology is a result of algorithmic discoveries that “were widely believed to be impossible,” allowing for a reduction in chip silicon area and lower power consumption by using fewer gates for each hashing core. This shortcuts the number of computations required for mining, as the mining hardware can re-use information acquired over time or share information with other hashing cores.\n\n“Chip designers get a game-changing improvement over whatever they already have achieved today,” says technology inventor Hanke. “For the Bitcoin mines of the future, AsicBoost will make all the difference between a profitable and an unprofitable mine.”\n\nThe results have the potential to lead to a dramatic improvement in performance in a zero sum industry where every little gain counts.\n\nThe Arms Race in Bitcoin’s Mining Industry\n\nBitcoin mining has always been a competitive endeavor with the short-lived CPU mining period quickly giving way to GPUs, followed by ASICs. Considered an arms race as each hash-share gain increases profits at the expense of competitors, competition is intense, with hardware constantly improved and older versions quickly becoming obsolete.\n\nA dramatic illustration can be seen during a three-month period between December 2015 to March 2016 when difficulty more than doubled from 75 petahash to 175 petahash, more than halving the reward for mining hardware in use during December 2015. The increase in difficulty followed an increase in price which reached a low of approximately $170 in 2015 to stand currently at $440.\n\nThe stakes can be high. Aquifer filed for bankruptcy in February 2015, claiming Bitcoin mining-related losses between $1 million and $10 million. In the same year, BTC Guild, one of the oldest mining pools, closed. Mining companies, therefore, are in constant search for more efficiency, leading to specialization.\n\nSome miners, such as Genesis Mining, provide customer-focused services, such as cloud mining. Other companies, such as F2Pool, own no hardware, focusing instead on running a mining pool used by cloud mining providers, innovative mining businesses such as HaoBTC or small miners with few terahashes. Still other miners, such as BitFury and Antpool/Bitmain, design their own hardware and sell mining hardware to the public, as well as running a mining pool.\n\nThe current level of profitability for mining farms, which employ rows upon rows of mining hardware, is unclear, with few willing to provide concrete numbers. Jihan Wu, cofounder of Bitmain, one of the largest mining pools and home of the recently announced Antminer S7, told Bitcoin Magazine that the level of profitability depends on electricity prices as well as the cost of mining rigs, but he could not provide specific numbers.\n\nMeanwhile, BitFury launched a new 16nm SHA256 ASIC to “deliver the maximum performance and efficiency possible” according to its website. BitFury recently announced an investment in BitPesa for an undisclosed amount as well as a new project to build a “blockchain-based property registry” having previously donated $100,000 to MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative developers fund, according to Alex Petrov of BitFury who told Bitcoin Magazine that it was BitFury’s initiative to create the fund which supports Bitcoin developers.\n\nWith mining revenue dependent on the strength of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and as its profits grow through efficiency gains, we may expect more investments and diversification. Meanwhile, the mining-efficiency race, which has built the world’s most powerful supercomputer to secure the $7 billion Bitcoin ecosystem, continues.', 'Are you an avid bitcoin user in Russia? If so, you could end up in jail.\n\nThe Russian Finance Ministry is preparing to introduce legislation next month that would fine and jail digital currency users, according to Bloomberg. The legislation, which was amended last month, has multiple tiers of penalties depending on the person’s usage, according to Interfax, a Russian news agency. For regular citizens who casually use bitcoin, the penalty is 500,000 rubles ($7,800 USD) or 4 years in jail; for organized groups, like bitcoin miners who confirm transactions on the network, it’s 1 million rubles ($15,500 USD) or 6 years in prison; executives or managers of financial institutions would face a fine of up to 2.5 million ruble ($38,000 USD) or up to 7 years in jail.\n\nRussia wouldn’t be the first country to go after bitcoin users—Iceland, Ecuador, and Vietnam have each banned the currency in some way.\n\nDigital currencies like bitcoin boast properties that spook central banks and regulators. Cryptocurrencies allow for anonymous transactions, which could be used for the trading of illicit goods and services. “Bitcoin can be used to finance the shadow economy and crimes, and this risk we cannot allow in Russia’s financial system, which we are striving to make transparent and healthy,” the Russian central bank’s press division told Bloomberg.\n\nThe Russian central bank did not respond to Quartz’s request for comment.', 'Bitcoin exchange Coinbase has announced that it now enabled instant purchase of bitcoin via debit cards. The feature is available to all users in the United States.\n\nCoinbase users in the United States will, like their European counterparts, have the means to instantly buy bitcoin with debit cards. The feature rollout comes after an initial announcement in early March when Coinbase launched the feature in its beta infancy.\n\nAt the time, only 1% of some 5.2B US debit cards in circulation had the means to get the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe announcement was made via Coinbase’s social media account.\n\nBitcoin buys using a debit card are now live to 100% of U.S. users on Coinbase! ?? https://t.co/KQSCYfECBX pic.twitter.com/4CCXr7osPR — Coinbase (@coinbase) April 28, 2016\n\nThe digital currency exchange also added that debit card purchasing of the cryptocurrency will be enabled in additional countries soon.\n\nA 3.75% fee will be applied for debit card purchases, compared to the 1% fee for payments made via a bank account. Debit card users will also be required to verify their identity before making their first bitcoin purchase.\n\nFurthermore, debit card users will have the limitation to purchase a maximum of $250 worth of bitcoin a day, as opposed to being able to buy up to $10,000 of bitcoin, per day, whilst using a bank account as a method of payment.\n\nWith a large number of US consumers increasingly choosing to use and depend squarely on their debit cards instead of credit cards, the move is more than likely to bring a slew of new users to Coinbase in a space where competitors like Circle already allows instant bitcoin purchases via debit cards.\n\nCoinbase also has the claim to be the first company behind the launch of a US-issued debit card, back in November 2015. Known as the “Shift Card”, the VISA debit card at launch allowed Coinbase users in 24 US states to spend and make settlements with the cryptocurrency online and offline at POS terminals at 38 million merchants around the world.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Blockchain data startup Tierion has raised $1m in seed funding from several of the industry’s leading venture capital firms.\n\nThe round was co-led by San Francisco-based Blockchain Capital and China-based Fenbushi Capital, which raised $50m in 2015 with the intent of investing in blockchain-based startups and projects. Digital Currency Group also participated in the round.\n\nThe news comes one year after the service launched last September following a winning debut at the Consensus 2015 Makeathon. Tierion allows users to turn data from web and mobile apps into blockchain receipts that are hashed, stored and timestamped on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn interview, CEO Wayne Vaughan said that the funding comes at a time when his firm is seeing increased interest from institutional partners seeking to leverage its free API service to ensure data integrity.\n\nVaughan told CoinDesk:\n\n""Tierion allows you to have a high volume of records anchored to public blockchains. Instead of putting something on the blockchain, we’re allowing you to anchor your data to the blockchain.""\n\nVaughan’s service uses the bitcoin blockchain, which he said is the preferred choice for any business that wants to ensure data integrity, positioning it as what could be one of the biggest institutional uses of such versions of the technology. Tierion, he said, is also preparing a version of its technology for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTierion has also hired Koinify veteran Tom Kysar as its second full-time employee, and said that is looking to double its staff in the coming months.\n\nGoing to market\n\nThough Vaughan hinted at institutional partners, right now, he said a diversity of startups and online services are already leveraging Tierion.\n\nFor example, he cited peer-to-peer leasing marketplace Flip, which is using the service to secure information on qualified lessees.\n\nIn statements, Flip founder and CEO Susannah Vila stated that her company is using the service as a way to ensure trust between landlords and subletters.\n\n""Integrating a report with a blockchain is one member of how we are gripping everybody honest and improving trust and trustworthiness for both landlords and renters,"" Vila said.\n\nTierion’s public partners also include Philips, the healthcare giant that has been increasingly active in announcing blockchain industry partnerships. The company announced it had conducted the first project with Philips in October.\n\nVaughan said his firm is also now working with its institutional partners to ensure its technology can provide assurances for data security specific to government or healthcare use cases, which may have more strict rules for such processes.\n\nCase for public chains\n\nWhile one of the more talked-about use cases for the technology, Vaughn doesn’t see permissioned blockchains as being useful for data integrity use cases.\n\n""Bitcoin is distributed all over the world, so you get data integrity. There’s a huge incentive for the blockchain to continue. Companies can go out of business, consortiums can get dissolved,"" Vaughan said.\n\nTierion’s fundraising notably follows an announcement by IBM in which the tech giant has indicated it is working to ensure its cloud environments are able to meet data security benchmarks for use in permissioned blockchain-based networks.\n\nStill, Vaughan’s investors believe that Tierion’s model may offer benefits, lauding the service as an example of how public blockchains can be leveraged by institutions.\n\n“You don’t need to build a blockchain for this.

The state is also home to one of the most robust Bitcoin communities in the world, and as a result you can buy all your organic groceries with cryptocurrency.\n\nThe organic revolution\n\nAccording to Jessica Love, one of the key organizers behind the Community Market Day Project, a network of small farmers and artisans markets, the desire for more local, natural, and pesticide-free farm products has been growing recently.\n\n“There are more and more farmers realizing the consumer/profit benefits of offering organic, since consumers are much more aware these days of toxins that are held within the skins and flesh of the vegetables and fruits. Many non organic farmers are offering food that is lightly sprayed with non toxic pesticides.”\n\nBardo Farm and Community Market Day Project\n\nBardo Farm, a farm in Croyden, accepts Bitcoin for its products, including beef, pork, and eggs. Additionally, Community Market Day events, which often feature Bardo products, are very Bitcoin-friendly, with the vast majority of vendors accepting it as payment (and the few outliers rapidly following suit). There are currently Community Market Day events in Manchester, Concord, Keene, Portsmouth, Northfield, and Salisbury, although the project is rapidly growing and may soon include more locations.\n\nOverstock.com’s Farmers Market\n\nAnother option for organic fare for Bitcoin in New Hampshire is through farms that sell through Overstock.com on the online retailer’s Farmers Market section. Although the farms themselves may not even be familiar with cryptocurrency, Overstock.com accepts Bitcoin as a form of payment, allowing all farms that sell through it to inadvertently accept crypto.\n\nWhole Foods\n\nFinally, organic supermarket Whole Foods has two locations in New Hampshire, in Bedford and Nashua. While Whole Foods itself does not accept Bitcoin, Gyft, you can use Bitcoin to buy a Whole Foods gift card through Gyft, which does. Though one small extra step is involved, you can effectively pay for your groceries from Whole Foods with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin catching on more and more with farmers markets\n\nThough not a traditionally tech-savvy group, according to Love, many farmers are opening up to the value of accepting Bitcoin for their products.', 'Markets Weekly is a column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology\'s use case as an asset class.\n\nBitcoin prices fluctuated significantly during the week ending 29th April, reaching a yearly high of $470 before falling below $440.\n\nGlobal bitcoin prices enjoyed a strong rally at the beginning of the week, rising 4.2% from $451.10 at 12:00 UTC on 22nd April to a high of $470.16 at 18:00 UTC on 26th April. This price represented the digital currency’s strongest value since 7th December, 2015, when it reached an inter-day high of $470.88, CoinDesk BPI data shows.\n\nBoth a short squeeze and retail investors helped fuel this rally, Petar Zivkovski, director of operations at bitcoin trading forum Whale Club, told CoinDesk.\n\nZivkovski offered Whaleclub internal data backing up his assertion, stating that prior to the decline in price, his users reported a long-to-short ratio of 5.5 to 1.\n\nBull run ends\n\nWhile bitcoin’s rally produced some quick gains, it lasted only a short while before the digital currency changed direction and started declining.\n\nOne factor was that trading volume during the run-up was ""lackluster"", Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, told CoinDesk. Hayes added that ""volumes should have grown more as we kept rising, and they didn\'t.""\n\n""Without more pressure to sustain the rally, it corrected,"" he said.\n\nBitcoinity data helps support his claim, as market participants traded 19.6m BTC during the seven prior days. This figure fell short of the roughly 30m BTC in weekly volume bitcoin repeatedly experienced when it traded within a range between $410 and $440.\n\nBy early trading on 27th April (between 12:00 and 14:59 UTC), the digital currency had fallen to a low of $450.87. Bitcoin then proceeded to break through the key psychological levels of both $450 and $440, dropping to a weekly low of $435.28 between 00:00-02:59 UTC on 28th April.\n\nThe sharp decline in bitcoin prices represented a long squeeze, which came easily since the long-to-short ratio was so high at the end of the rally, Zivkovski told CoinDesk.\n\n""As large and smart players started exiting at the top after the price failed to make new highs, the rookie players who bought the top started to close their long positions aggressively to cut their losses,” he said, adding:\n\n""This aggressive selling then continued to push price down, which continued to trigger stop losses for long positions (both automatic and manual) across exchanges.""\n\nHowever, the week didn\'t end on a sour note.\n\nDuring the last few days of the week, bitcoin managed to recover some of its losses, surpassing $450 between 21:00-23:59 UTC on 28th April and then finishing the week at $449.86.\n\nEther\'s slide continues\n\nWhile bitcoin pushed higher, prices for ether, the native token on the Ethereum blockchain, declined, falling to 0.019 BTC (roughly $8) by the time bitcoin hit $470.16.\n\nThis figure was 13.6% lower than ether’s value of 0.022 BTC (about $10) at the start of the week, representing a decline more than three times the change experienced by bitcoin.\n\nOne market expert, Chris Burniske, told CoinDesk the negative correlation existed partially ""due to the fact that ether is valued in terms of bitcoin"".\n\nBurniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, stated that another major driver of this negative correlation was market participants moving capital from the former market to the latter, a trend he argued adversely affected ether.\n\nAt press time, ether managed to recover somewhat, ending the week with a closing price of 0.020 BTC (or about $9).\n\nCharles L.

CEX.IO co-founder and CEO Oleksandr Lutskevych said there are no other exchanges aside from CEX.IO that currently offer instant withdrawals of fiat funds to Visa and MasterCard at low commissions.\n\nWithdrawal requests are processed automatically, and, in most cases, instantly. CEX.IO said individual cases made require some time, and the exchange is in talks with payment service providers to enable momentary processing for all clients.\n\n“Global commonness of using payment cards effectively intersects with people’s will to buy and trade Bitcoins,” said Lutskevych in the press release.\n\nThe exchange said that once a card is linked to a CEX.IO profile, clients are able to deposit and withdraw fiat funds to their card in just a few steps. The company obtained a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) certificate to ensure stringent safety of provided payment card data.\n\nCEX.IO, which recently added Ether trading, intends to continue expanding payment options as well as introduce bitcoin-oriented debit cards where clients can load bitcoin directly.\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase announced via Twitter on Thursday that debit card purchases of bitcoin in the U.S. are now available in all 50 states.\n\nReporting on the announcement, TechCrunch said it’s a big deal, mainly because more and more American consumers rely solely on debit cards. The publication noted that a three- to five-day wait time to receive bitcoins have led many consumers to consider other platforms.\n\nTechCrunch reported that Coinbase will charge a 3.75 percent fee on debit card payments, compared to one percent for buys funded by bank accounts. Clients wishing to use debit cards will have to confirm their identity before making their first purchase.\n\nTechCrunch also said Coinbase will introduce a daily cap of $250 on debit card purchases, far below the $10,000 daily limit when using a bank account.\n\nDespite the additional verification and low limit, said TechCrunch, debit card acceptance should still usher in a wave of new users registering to buy bitcoin on Coinbase.\n\nThe company also tweeted that the feature is coming to other nations soon, although, as TechCrunch pointed out, most European consumers have been able to use debit cards on the platform since last summer.\n\nImage credits:\n\nCEX.IO logo and Oleksandr Lutskevych’s photo – Courtesy of CEX.IO\n\nCoinbase logo – Courtesy of Coinbase', 'Over the weekend, I found myself watching “Tesla: Master of Lightning,” a PBS production streaming on Netflix. From the story of Nikola Tesla, I saw parallels between his invention, alternating current (AC), and what bitcoin has been experiencing for some time now.\n\nOn June 6, 1884, Tesla arrived in New York. The Serbian immigrant, who was from modern day Croatia, was thrilled to finally meet his hero, Thomas Edison, the renowned American inventor, who was the force behind direct current (DC).\n\nTesla could not wait to wow Edison with his alternating current discoveries. Up to that moment, many of the people he had explained the technology to, including his professors, had dismissed it.\n\nHe believed Edison, being heavily involved with the science of electricity, would not only understand how alternating current would change the world, but would also help him bring it to commercial use.\n\nEdison did hire him, thanks to the letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor, a business associate of his in Europe. However, he would hear nothing of Tesla’s AC power system.\n\n“My personal desire would be to prohibit entirely the use of alternating currents. They are unnecessary as they are dangerous,” Edison is quoted saying.\n\nIf you replace the words “alternating currrents” with “bitcoin,” the statement above could as well have been uttered by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s Chairman, President and CEO.\n\nGiving up acquired turf\n\nSince the 1870s, Edison built his business in North America and Europe around DC technology. New York was running entirely on his invention; he had invested a lot in the technology.\n\nAs expected, he was not ready to give up the turf he had acquired. At least not willingly. Do not expect the banking industry to be any different.\n\nAfter working for Edison for a few months and helping improve the efficiency of his DC systems, Tesla branched in 1887 amid some acrimony, opened his own laboratory, and started working on his longtime dream of making AC work for humankind.\n\nHe best understood that while DC was a great leap from using candles for lighting and raw animal force for turning mortars, it had inefficiencies that could be taken care of by alternating current.\n\nThe voltage of a direct current cannot be changed. What is generated is just what is consumed. That means that if electricity is generated with too high voltage, bulbs will blow up on the other end.\n\nThere was also the issue of transmission over long distances. To do that with DC, you needed very thick copper wires and you needed boosting stations after every mile or so.\n\nOn the other hand, the voltage of AC can be raised and lowered using transformers. Even more important, high voltage electricity can be transmitted over long distances without the need for boosting stations.\n\nIn addition, the voltage could be controlled depending on the needs of the machine or bulb on the other end.\n\nNegative media campaign\n\nEdison embarked on a negative media campaign and took it upon himself to demonstrate to the public how this new technology was dangerous.\n\nHe went as far as electrocuting animals using AC in public shows. It is also said that he orchestrated the use of AC to execute criminals just to drive the point home that AC could only be associated with death.\n\nThis parallels the effort many have put into portraying bitcoin as dangerous. Making it look like the perfect tool for criminals and terrorists.\n\nBy all accounts, Edison was winning the ‘War of Current’, as it came to be known — a feud that is also well captured by Author Jill Jonnes in her book Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World.\n\nPeople who mattered and were in positions of power gave Edison their ears.\n\nThe famous British Physicist Lord Kelvin, for example, sent a cable to members of a commission he chaired that was tasked with finding ways to tap the power of the Niagara Falls, suggesting they “avoid the gigantic mistake of AC.”\n\nTesla had an opportunity to change this perception in front of 100,000 spectators, a crowd that included Lord Kelvin. Westinghouse, the company he worked for, had just won a contract to light that year’s Columbian exposition in Chicago. It was to be the first fair in the world to be lighted by electricity.\n\nWestinghouse won the contract for the simple reason that it quoted a significantly lower price ($0.5million) than Edison’s General Electric did ($1 million). This difference was made possible by the AC technology.\n\nIn an effort to stop Tesla, GE refused Westinghouse permission to use its incandescent lamps at the fair. But Westinghouse worked overtime and devised lamps for the occasion.\n\nAs night fell on May 1, 1893, eager spectators filed into the fairgrounds. President Grover Cleveland pressed a button and the whole ground, and the surrounding environment, exploded with light never seen before.\n\nAnd that ushered in a new era of electricity. Everywhere you look now; everything is happening thanks to alternating current.\n\nThese challenges AC technology had to overcome to be where it is now are so removed from us that it’s hard to imagine its adoption was in question at the beginning.\n\nLikely, a number of years from now, it will be the same with bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nRupert Hackett is the Community Manager at BuyaBitcoin.com.au.

He writes for multiple bitcoin websites and regularly blogs for buyabitcoin.com.au.', 'In The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else (2000), Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto argued that the underlying cause of Third-World poverty is weak property rights. Citizens of poor countries can\'t securely develop plots of land or put them up as collateral because they don\'t have clear legal titles. In a world ""where ownership of most assets is difficult to trace and validate and is governed by no legally recognizable set of rules,"" de Soto wrote, ""most assets, in short, are dead capital.""\n\nDe Soto is now part of a new initiative to use the ""blockchain,"" the technology that undergirds the digital currency Bitcoin, to solve the dead capital problem.\n\nThe San Francisco-based Bitcoin company BitFury announced last week that it was working with de Soto and the Republic of Georgia on a project to use blockchain technology to build a new land registry, as Forbes first reported. ""By building a blockchain-based property registry,"" one Georgian government official said in a statement, the country ""can lead the world in changing the way land titling is done and pave the way to additional prosperity for all.""\n\nA ""blockchain"" is essentially an online database with attributes that make it well-suited to protecting the integrity of land registries. The first thing that sets blockchains apart from other databases is that anyone with a computer and an internet connection can download a complete copy. And the information contained in the file is constantly updated through the internet (roughly every 10 minutes in the case of the Bitcoin blockchain). This means the most up-to-date information is always publicly accessible. And the government has no power to tamper with or delete the information stored on a blockchain because the data can only be altered by using secret passwords dispersed among users.\n\nYet uploading actual land titles to a blockchain is impractical because these distributed databases aren\'t designed to hold very much information. So companies in this space are devising elegant ways to anchor large data sets to the blockchain in ways that piggyback on its security and immutability, even when the specific information itself is stored elsewhere.\n\nBitFury isn\'t the first company to work in this space. The Austin, Texas-based company technology company Factom has been in talks since 2015 with the government of Honduras to use blockchain technology to build a secure land registry in that country.\n\nCurrently, Honduras stores its title records in a room at the bottom of ""dusty stairs"" in a ""nasty old government building,"" Factom CEO Peter Kirby said in an interview last year with Reason. Until recently, the room had no door.\n\n""Anybody could go in, pull down a book, open up the spine, and replace a title record with a new title record,"" Kirby said. Some government bureaucrats have altered the records to assign themselves beachfront property. The Honduran government did at one point attempt to digitize its land records, but the database it built was unuseable.\n\nA tamper-proof land-titling system, says Kirby, will lead poor countries to build ""all of the infrastructure we take for granted in the developed world.""\n\nFor more on blockchain technology, click below to watch a recent Reason TV video on Ethereum, a new blockchain platform that\'s well-suited for land registries and many many other types of applications:', ""Bitcoin wallet vendor Mycelium has announced the release of their new Bitcoin wallet and the launch of its crowdsale. This announcement was posted on Reddit and states that the new wallet shall be simply called Mycelium.\n\nThe announcement claims that the new wallet has been equipped with a plug in API that will allow anyone to integrate their own services and features directly into the wallet.\n\nPrior to this, companies whose services run on Mycelium were usually added to the platform by its developers. But according to this release, with the new API businesses and developers will be able to add their own plug-ins quickly and easily without waiting for Mycelium developers to do it.\n\nA spokesperson of Mycelium says:\n\n“This also allows businesses to focus on their core business strengths. For example, an exchange's main job is to create and manage trades. Making a custom wallet specifically for their exchange is a distraction and an unnecessary cost. With our wallet, they can let us focus on the front-end, UI, and trade functions, while they focus on just making sure all their users' money is handled securely and trades are settled correctly.”\n\nSupport for multiple currencies and digital assets\n\nAnother feature claimed to be embedded in the new wallet is the ability to support many more digital assets beyond Bitcoin.\n\nWith the help of the plugin API architecture, anyone would be able to add support for any type of currency or asset, be it Litecoin, Doge, ColoredCoin, Ether, Factom, or personally issued assets like stocks, tickets, or hotel keys.\n\nA spokesperson explains:\n\n“We are uniquely positioned to have an advantage in this, because Mycelium already runs a set of highly optimized backend servers that handle and transfer digital assets. We plan to extend this backend architecture to support many more such assets.”\n\nFull financial management suite\n\nApart from managing various assets, the company claims that the new app will let users perform a large number of financial management functions, from creating, tracking, and paying invoices, to tracking budgets, revenues and expenses, profits and losses, inventory, and customer and contact lists.\n\nAlso that there will also be social media integration, and encrypted communication built right into the app.\n\nThe goal is to allow anyone, from someone managing their personal finances to someone running their large business, manage all their finances from our app.\n\nSupport for multiple platforms\n\nMycelium is switching to the ReactNative platform, and going fully open source.\n\nThe new platform will allow it to run mostly the same code on Android and iOS (with Windows Phone and eventually PC in the near future, too).\n\nAll users will have the same user experience, and have access to largely the same functions (except for some hardware limitations).\n\nCrowdsale\n\nAlexander Kuzmin, CEO at Mycelium, also announces that 5% of Mycelium is up for Crowdsale among its users and Bitcoin / cryptocurrency / blockchain technology developers and supporters.\n\nKuzmin says that the company wants Mycelium users to be stakeholders. The company thinks that it is much better when the stakeholders are users, partners and customers.\n\nIt will use the money to support the current version (and update it from time to time with the new features) as well as to develop the new Mycelium that it has already started working on about six months ago.\n\nKuzmin also says that the new Mycelium will inherit all of the Bitcoin functionality that the Mycelium Wallet has now and will get a lot more. It is being designed for both Android and iOS from the very beginning and will be much closer to non-bitcoin (blockchain) users utilizing blockchain for managing fiat with several other features.\n\nIn addition to this, the company has already gone through all the necessary internal legal procedures needed to carry out the Crowdsale."", 'With the high mobile phone penetration already in place, Africa is set to enable more users to download a Bitcoin wallet on their devices.\n\nIn an email last year, Werner van Rooyen from Bitx, one of Africa’s biggest Bitcoin exchange firms, wrote that Africa has been waiting for something like Bitcoin for a long time.\n\nWhy? He said the continent of over a billion people has been underserved by financial institutions for such a long time.\n\nFactors for Bitcoin use growth in Africa\n\nSome of the factors he cited in this regard are the high cost of financial infrastructure, high fees compared to the average earnings, high cost of having a physical presence like ATMs, bank branches and remittance offices.\n\nTo cap it all, he noted that there\'s been a lot of talk in finance of ""the next billion"" and a big part of this next billion will come out of Africa.\n\nToday, Africa has continued to wake up to some of the reality of using the digital currency particularly with the high mobile phone penetration already in place to enable more users in Africa to download a Bitcoin wallet on their devices.\n\nThree other components which have also assisted Bitcoin use in Africa: growing number of exchange companies like BitX which have been working to engage with the public and government regulators to increase adaption; increase in developers to build more innovative products and uses for Bitcoin (like integration with physical and online stores); and getting more people to start using it as a means of transacting.\n\nBitcoin use cases in Africa\n\nBut in which ways has Bitcoin use manifested across the continent to be a sought-after currency among the people? Here are four of them:\n\n1. Remittance\n\nTop of the list of what Bitcoin is primarily used for in Africa is for remittance purposes.\n\nThough the African remittances which flow to and within the continent are officially pegged at $40 billion per year by the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), industry insiders say this figure amounts to just a third or fourth of the actual amount transacted as most transfers are conducted via informal means.\n\nCoupled with high remittance charges – the World Bank says Sub-Saharan Africa remains the highest cost region with an average cost of 9.5 percent - these have created inconveniences which discourage the movement of funds through known official means such as financial institutions.\n\nThis is due partly to the blockades created by the lack of adequate facilities in parts of Africa to enhance the transfer and exchange of funds across borders without any form of restriction on such transactions.\n\nIt also helps solve import and export payment challenges and overcome currency liquidity constraints in Nigeria.\n\nNow, Africans are reaching out to Bitcoin, particularly for its low value payments since there isn\'t a fixed minimum fee which gets charged to send money for a transaction either to the person sitting next to them, to a business or to a peer-to-peer on the other side of the world.\n\n2. Crowdfunding\n\nDue to its anonymous nature the next main use of Bitcoin in Africa is to source funds to support humanitarian efforts .\n\nTo help ensure that safe and reliable water is provided across Kenya, for example, The Water Project launched a new initiative which last year sought Bitcoin donations to fund new sensor-enabled water projects in the country. An appeal was launched for Bitcoin donations to Botswana\'s SOS Children\'s Villages in 2014.\n\nGlobally, the charity sector has been touted to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the financial services sector’s investigation into the new technology.\n\nWith the experimental phases being conducted by international organizations such as Unicef with its unicoin donations, and African crowdfunding platforms such as Bankymoon and Usuzi which accept Bitcoin, the appeal now is for global support for a cause based on its potential convenience to a wider audience.\n\nSouth African startup, The Sun Exchange, for example, seeks to scale up its marketplace which crowdfunds small-scale solar projects using digital currencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nAs with remittances, it appears that these two uses will remain at the top of Bitcoin use in Africa. The freedom, openness and ease of use which Bitcoin provides are yet unrivaled and are not likely to go away soon.\n\nAs such, it shows that Bitcoin use is gaining acceptance and venturing into new aspects of life across a mobile phone-led African context.\n\n3. Tech startups adaptation\n\nIn the tech sector in Kenya, coupled with East Africa\'s powerhouse economy and a developed ICT hub for the region, the digital currency BitPesa startup has cashed in on the growing success of the mobile money sector in the country.\n\nM-pesa recorded a huge success which has stretched beyond Africa, thus highlighting an opportunity which made Bitpesa become the first Bitcoin startup based in Africa to receive VC funding. Other Bitcoin enthusiasts are also pushing for its adoption and trying to create more awareness of the need to adopt policies around digital currencies.\n\nThen along comes Bitsoko with its Android mobile wallet. What this shows is that the exponential growth in startups across Africa has been fuelling the integration of Bitcoin as a form of payment by online markets to avoid damaging financial security issues.\n\nThis integration eases e-commerce platforms’ burden of having to store sensitive financial data on their local servers and reduces the risk of a data breach which could leak personal user information and breed mistrust.\n\n4. Improved financial education\n\nLearning to buy and sell Bitcoin in parts of Africa is no longer new today.\n\nMore people are coming to realize the potential of making money and the liberty to learn about money issues at their own pace by trading in Bitcoin.\n\nPlatforms such as localbitcoins.com, altcointrader.co.za, bitpesa trade etc are offering traders – including from Africa – the opportunity to trade in Bitcoin using their local currencies.\n\nICE3X launched Bitcoin trading in Nigeria, the largest recipient of remittances in 2015 Nigeria ($21 billion) according to the World Bank.\n\nPremise is a San Francisco-based data and analytics company which track macroeconomic trends in real-time for organizations such as the World Bank and the United Nations who use BitPesa to send frequent bulk mobile payments to Tanzanian contributors’ mobile wallets.\n\nBitcoin has triggered many people’s interest to gain more financial insight and improve their understanding of the money market as well as the creation of Bitcoin Academy.', ""What started out as just Shaun Gilchrist’s hobby is developing to become the world’s first and premier price index for Bitcoin, BitcoinAverage.\n\nBasic physics describes how a simple innocent bathtub immersion inspired an innovation that has affected mankind. Archimedes did not set out to discover the principle of floatation, but ships are built today based on the principles he discovered.\n\nGlobal Bitcoin Price Index\n\n“There was no funding involved, it was created initially as a hobby. I wanted to provide it to the community to do my part for bitcoin,” said Shaun Gilchrist, founder and CEO of BitcoinAverage, whose Global Bitcoin Price Index (GBX) was the first of its kind in the industry and is still the most widely used price source for the cryptocurrency.\n\nGilchrist explains:\n\n“There was truly no goal to monetise the project, it was open source and even access to the application program interface (API) was completely free, three years later, it still is.”\n\nBitcoinAverage\n\nAccording to expert, Brandon Kostinuk, of Vanbex, under expressed demand, the industry-leading system is set to kick off with pioneering changes including major upgrades to its system, soon.\n\nHardened investors to hobbyist users of Bitcoin will find these newest developments exciting prospects for the data-driven side of the ecosystem.\n\nKostinuk continues by identifying that they may also seem like predictable innovations for the world’s most valuable, yet volatile, cryptocurrency. Yet, as simple as that goal may appear, creating an index for a decentralized, globally used and traded cryptocurrency, involves substantial forethought and ingenuity, especially to travel from selfless dedication to an unparalleled index architecture.\n\nIt also looks as if BitcoinAverage is poised to sustain itself as the industry frontrunner and secure the status as the de facto index choice for Bitcoin users, traders, investors and more.\n\nEvolving system\n\nBitcoinAverage as an aggregated Bitcoin price index was launched in August 2013.\n\nGilchrist explained that he initially wanted to know the difference in markets to better gauge potential profits for off-exchange trading and the brokering of trades, which was taking off in the U.K. around that time.\n\nAfter successfully creating a simple script in 2012 to compare the premium of the British Pound market to the US dollar, Gilchrist recognized the data may be well received by others.\n\nThe price index was soon released as an open source and the journey of BitcoinAverage began, with thousands of monthly users soon taking to the earliest iteration of the system.\n\nIn his claims, Gilchrist says that the company’s data extends as far back as 2010, encompassing a volume that surpasses key competitors.\n\nBut it’s not just breadth and back-end programming. The index is also highly approachable, as it is comprehensive, from a front-end user perspective.\n\nGilchrist says:\n\n“The layout has grown into a less clunky interface than other indices. The display contains legible data with an adequate colour contrast important for those that spend hours researching and analyzing data in single sittings.”\n\nFiat and cryptocurrency\n\nFurthermore, the currency and commodity options abound. Including USD, EUR, CNY, GBP and CAD options, the global index consists of over 165 currencies to Gilchrist’s estimation.\n\nThe wide accessibility to fiat currencies and commodities provides an additional layer of relevance on a global scale, especially important for a cryptocurrency that extends beyond any one set of borders.\n\nThere were some initial pains, however, and to some extent those same inflictions remain today.\n\nGilchrist says:\n\n“In the early days [we] were coping with the frequent issues with exchanges, their API’s uptimes, and the fact that one could just disappear overnight.”\n\nThough his experience of the volatile nature of the industry, Gilchrist labelled as necessary learning curves and asserts adaptation to market conditions as continuous endeavours for the London-based index.\n\nBitcoinAverage fees\n\nThe current BitcoinAverage system does not address 0% fee exchanges. Gilchrist claims that the company is working on it.\n\nHe attaches the reason for the current situation to the fact that users can trade on the exchange for free with an unlimited base on a very tiny spread.\n\nThe increased volume, sometimes exponentially, can skew the average on a weighted average price which is what BitcoinAverage currently supplies.\n\n“We have rewritten our whole backend from scratch,” said Gilchrist. “A major decision for any software provider.”\n\nComprehensive Bitcoin price index\n\nKostinuk observes that the upcoming launch of the BitcoinAverage latest API, which has recently been released in a closed beta to allow testing and feedback before product finalization, means BitcoinAverage is closing in on its next evolutionary step: Scalability for the needs of enterprise.\n\nThe claim is that the new interface will be bundled with an updated front-end, offering customization and tailored programming to provide real-time, by-the-second updates, data points from exchanges all over the world, and the capability to adapt and adjust those indices to even the most idiosyncratic needs.\n\nThe changes underway are expected to usher in the most advanced, comprehensive Bitcoin price index to date with pioneering features that push the system well beyond capabilities of competitor indices.\n\nHooked on potential\n\nPotential is the key word. It speaks to the core necessity of a pricing index, for Bitcoin or any other commodity.\n\nGilchrist says:\n\n“I have been a ‘bitcoiner’ myself since 2010. It was mentioned to me by a developer, and from the first few weeks of research, toying with mining, et cetera, I was hooked on its potential.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency, while commanding over USD $6 billion in market capitalization today, is a young asset class.\n\nAnd granted stability in price has existed in recent months, since January, the cryptocurrency remains subject to volatility for a myriad of factors, in particular, the gradual rate of adoption and its perceived store of value, which is tantamount to its consideration over gold-backed fiat currencies.\n\nFees, rates and policies\n\nFurther complicating the asset class is the range of exchanges worldwide, which involves a unique array of fees, rates and policies — perhaps shaped by the country the exchange is based in — that, in the end, can affect the bottom-line for users, traders or investors.\n\nThis is where the core value of a system like BitcoinAverage’s shines through.\n\nSupplying a weighted average that incorporates over four dozen of the world’s exchanges, with 0% fee exchanges soon to be included, access to the widest variety of currency markets available among indices, there’s no better method of gauging the potential swings of the prone-to-volatility cryptocurrency.\n\nAnd with billions of dollars at stake, such a system is invaluable.\n\nDevelop or disappear\n\nIn relation to Bitcoin’s ability to subsist, Gilchrist says:\n\n“I believe being the first to produce something is a great advantage in many areas. Will that be enough on its own? I’m not sure. I put my faith in the developers. I think at this stage, regardless of things like regulations, it's in their hands.”\n\nIn a similar stride is BitcoinAverage.\n\nGilchrist’s company is inching closer to morphing the basement-based hobby turned three-year open source project into a viable business.\n\nWith that, the three-year-old system steps closer to becoming the generally accepted, go-to price index for Bitcoin.\n\nSuch triumph, however, rests on BitcoinAverage’s development team. Gilchrist assures there will be more on that front, along with progress already made, in the weeks to come.\n\nLet’s just hope the cryptocurrency itself can too push onward in positive fashion and reach the heights it once grasped in 2013, back when BitcoinAverage was just a nascent endeavour."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'A recent dispute within the W3C\'s Web Payments groups has given skeptics of bitcoin\'s sometimes chaotic development process ""cause for pause"" when thinking about the best way to deploy new financial technology.\n\nThe dichotomy between W3C and the bitcoin community\'s approach to technology gained prominence in February, when a few members of W3C’s web payments groups were first vocal about what they deemed a lack of participation from blockchain innovators, specifically those in the bitcoin community.\n\nThat call for participation led Blockstream to join the group’s efforts, which might spur other bitcoin companies to come onboard as well.\n\nHowever, a notable rift has now divided the W3C Web Payments Working Group after the perceived influence of browser vendors on the process prompted questions about the overall model. During a February decision centered on determining which specifications to work towards, Google and Microsoft seemed to garner too much control over the web payments standard, according to several individuals involved.\n\nManu Sporny, chairman of the W3C’s Web Payments Community Group, has now been faced with a key question – is it better to lead with code, or is having a more formal process like the W3C\'s a better model?\n\nBoth have benefits and drawbacks, but right now, he’s less enamored with the W3C process.\n\nSporny told CoinDesk:\n\n""It looks like two of the largest companies have undue influence over the process.""\n\nJust last month, Sporny came under fire for expressing concern that the bitcoin ecosystem hasn\'t joined the W3C web payments work because they’re emboldened by hype.\n\nThe W3C was coming at standards from a legacy institution’s viewpoint – that there was a more professional process in place that, while slow, has proven successful for web standards since its creation in 1994.\n\nThe dispute\n\nThe Web Payments work was focused around a browser-based API that would streamline and standardize the process of paying online in an effort to decrease shopping cart abandonment.\n\nSince October 2015, the W3C has been incubating two different web payments specifications towards this goal – one built by the Web Payments Community Group and the other being developed by the browser vendors. This was a strange move, but the groups were assured both specifications would be merged together, rather than one being elected over the other.\n\nSporny has blogged about the W3C\'s work and the issue, detailed here.\n\nBut that didn’t happen. The work the Web Payments Community Group put into a specification was scrapped for the spec the browser vendors introduced, and on 21st April, the first public working draft was published for feedback from the Web Payments Working Group.\n\nAccording to Ian Jacobs, the W3C’s payments activity lead, there was significant support for the documents the group published. Out of the 22 member groups that voted, 15 members supported all four documents that make up the spec. There are 42 member groups altogether.\n\n""A lot of people were fine with it, but I think a lot of us just wanted the bickering to stop,” said Shane McCarron, projects manager at Spec-Ops.io, a group that identifies critical open standards and helps to move those along and the company’s liason to the web payments work.\n\nWhile McCarron thinks the decision was short-sighted, he remains optimistic. Currently the group is integrating concepts from the community group’s spec into that of the browser vendor’s where there are weaknesses.\n\nInternet pioneer Pindar Wong has been surveying the situation in a similar way as Sporny.\n\nThe question, for him, becomes whether the fast and messy open-source development that blockchain protocols like bitcoin and Ethereum use is better than the slow and steady – and maybe financially conflicted – professional standards work.\n\nWong, chairman of Hong Kong-based FinTech infrastructure consultancy VeriFi Inc, has been active in the bitcoin community and is also a member of the W3C Web Payments Community Group. He’s straddled both the open-source community and professional standards world for some time.\n\nSure, Wong admits, the progress in the bitcoin community has been chaotic, most recently as it relates to proposed increases to the network\'s block size, and those impassioned arguments all happen in the public eye.\n\nBut that passion in an open environment is why so many people are drawn to the bitcoin space.\n\nControl and conflict\n\nSporny asserts some members of the web payments working group have been able to exert more control over the process – and this cat-and-mouse game could have something to do with relevancy.\n\nThe W3C stays relevant because of the participation from large, professional businesses such as Google and Microsoft. Plus, large enterprises pay substantial membership fees, upwards of $80,000 a year.\n\nTo avoid the conflicts of interest that may arise, the W3C has set up a transparent process, recording and transcribing group phone calls. But there have been workarounds, including Web Payments meetings that have been closed to reporters and members taking measures to sometimes go off the record.\n\nWhile Sporny and Wong are rethinking whether the W3C is the best place to develop an open and free Internet of value, the two men also worry that the bitcoin community is headed in the same direction, with venture capitalists and large companies enjoying more say in debates. And this centralizing tendency can often lead to monopolies or oligopolies.\n\nSuch meetings are borne out of a desire to make consensus easier to reach, Wong said, but they run the risk of giving more say to those who may put their business models before the network itself.\n\nFull circle\n\nIn this way, recent developments in both the web payments and bitcoin communities seem to mirror each other. And such a development is not without historical precedent.\n\nWhen the Internet was young, developers were largely in favor of a technology open for everyone to use. But as the industry has grown, creating billion-dollar companies along the way, it looks like it’s moving towards ossification – the tendency toward rigid, conventional and unimaginative states of being, said Wong.\n\nIn the W3C\'s case, the group’s initial declaration nearly four years ago was to build technological web infrastructure for open financial services, allowing more people to pay in the way they were comfortable with online.\n\nIt was an ambitious and idealistic goal.\n\nBut out of this came a new objective, one that\'s arguably more realistic – the desire to build an API that focused on eliminating shopping cart abandonment by standardizing the online checkout experience.\n\nSporny wondered where this ""first-world problem"" came from, but decided it was all just baby steps in the process to democractize payments online.\n\nIt is not that shopping cart abandonment isn’t a problem for online retailers, it\'s just that the razor-focus on the issue seems too narrow for the project’s original priority of leveling the playing field and creating a fair market.\n\nGiven this focus, as well as the browser vendor spec, Sporny worries other stakeholders will be at a disadvantage.\n\nThe current spec doesn’t take into account third party applications like bitcoin wallets, bank-branded payment apps or merchant loyalty cards because that work could take a while to complete and could stall the ability to deploy the API and get early feedback from developers.\n\nBy rushing the spec through that only the browser vendors can implement and get people accustomed to, that could make it a struggle to add-on other applications in the future since consumers would have to readjust to a new process.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily the browser vendor’s evil little plan; instead, Sporny thinks the representatives that Google and Microsoft have sent to the W3C don’t have the time or support from their parent companies to work long hours ironing out the kinks. Most of the representatives work with the W3C as a side project.\n\nGoogle representatives have said that third party applications are important but haven’t prioritized that, instead looking to ship something fast and iterate later.\n\nBut leveling the playing field is becoming an increasingly pressing issue as the next billion people – those in developing countries – gear up to come online, said Wong. He wants a web experience that’s empowering, ""where people don’t have to wait for the banks or the telephone companies or the Internet companies to reach out to them and their geographic areas"".\n\nThis example is analogous to bitcoin, where the conversation several years ago focused on allowing consumers and merchants to take commerce into their own hands with the ability to pay quickly and securely without getting gouged by fees from the various intermediaries.\n\nBut as more money was invested and technical details were hashed out, particularly on the regulation front, the dialogue has shifted to defining bitcoin as a censorship-resistant payment mechanism, not necessarily one that equalizes payments.\n\n""It raises the question around who’s beholden to who when developing technology on an international scale,"" Sporny said. ""The blockchain stuff for all its messiness is not seeing the potential for two companies to take over the development of the work, yet.""\n\nChaotic wires image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

These stocks are now available to trade with up to 10x leverage using your bitcoin only — no banks involved!\n\nVery excited to also see that pre-market (8AM-9:30AM ET) and after-hours (4PM-5PM ET) trading are available for these markets. This is a world first.\n\nWhaleclub Director of Operations, Petar Zivkovski, along with Director of Marketing and Business Development, Jessica Lee, took over operations of Whaleclub in October 2015. This was merely a year after TradingView members founded the Club as a real-time feed of bitcoin trade ideas, supplied primarily from the TradingView and Teamspeak communities.\n\nWhile Lee has a background in Public Relations and international journalism, Zivkovski has been trading professionally and building trading systems for over two decades. He began using bitcoin in early 2013, and quickly started trading.\n\nThe Whaleclub mission is to build a globally accessible trading platform powered by bitcoin, Zivkovsky explains. “Bitcoin really excels at transferring value quickly, cheaply, and globally. Whaleclub is bitcoin-only and the entire team are strong believers in the bitcoin, the currency, and Bitcoin the community.”\n\nUsing a bitcoin only platform means that trading accounts don’t require any personally identifying information. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering procedures (AML) are not required. “This is not something you can achieve with political currencies,” states Lee.\n\nHowever, Lee says that Whaleclub monitors the evolving digital currency regulation landscape very closely. “We're strongly in favor of a global, smart regulatory framework for digital currencies - that would go a long way in establishing mainstream legitimacy.”\n\n- Jessica Lee, Director of Marketing and Business Development at WhaleClub\n\nThe New York BitLicense is the common term used for a business license of digital currency activities, issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) under regulations designed for companies. This particular regulation is limited to activities that include the New York State or a New York State resident. The third and final draft was issued in June 2013, spearheaded by former Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky.\n\nOther regions, are yet to define clear-cut regulatory frameworks, and the landscape is ever-evolving. Lee advises that “like many other bitcoin companies, we are open to hearing from and collaborating with regulators on a case-by-case basis until an encompassing regulatory framework is established.”\n\nWhaleclub is based in Hong Kong, home to one of the largest communities of bitcoin traders in the world. The trading platform, powered entirely by bitcoin, now serves over 8000 traders. The team reported executing over 100,000 trades, with a volume of over US$10m in bitcoin last month.\n\nThe platform offers advanced order types for experienced traders; a simple, intuitive user interface for new traders; spreads and volatility that cater to scalpers, swing traders, mid-term and long-term traders; and the option to go long and short at the same time with different position sizes, which caters to hedgers.\n\n- Whaleclub\n\nLee describes the trading platforms reception as positive, since launching early in 2015, and community feedback inspired further development. New markets, such as Gold, Oil, and EUR/USD, have been added, trading against bitcoin from anywhere in the world, without the involvement of banks.\n\nAll Whaleclub trades are executed instantly, at the price specified by the trader, or at the best available price when the trader enters a market. According to Lee, having zero fees on order executions, positions, balances, inactivity, and deposits sets Whaleclub apart from other trading platforms.\n\nBy comparison, one of the largest cryptocurrency trading platforms, Bitfinex, charges 0.100% maker fees and 0.200% taker fees for all trades less than $500,000.\n\nMaker fees are paid when a limit order is placed under the ticker price to buy, or over the ticker price for a sell. Taker fees are paid when an order is executed against the orderbook.\n\n- Whaleclub\n\nCurrently, Whaleclub offers up to 40x leverage. 10x, 5x, and 3.3x are also available, or traders can simply trade without. The only restriction is a 20 bitcoin maximum for an active position. Withdrawals are processed manually “through a standardized, checklist-based procedure,” which usually takes place once a day.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is currently trading for US$453.91, up 1.25 % in 24 hours. The current market cap is US$7,030,500,000.""]"
