07/01/2016,"['A Secret Service agent who stole money seized by the government in the investigation of underground drug bazaar Silk Road is now suspected of stealing money in at least two other cases, according to court filings unsealed on Thursday.\n\nIn the larger of those cases, he is thought to have been behind the theft of about $700,000 worth of bitcoin from a Secret Service account three months after the agency was urged to block his access, the documents say.\n\nFormer agent Shaun Bridges pleaded guilty last year and was sentenced in December to nearly six years in prison for stealing more than $800,000 of the crypto currency bitcoin during the Silk Road investigation.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nAccording to an affidavit unsealed Thursday, the Justice Department learned in April 2015 that Bridges might have kept a private cryptographic key giving him access to a bitcoin wallet with the $700,000 in currency that the Silk Road task force had seized in 2014. The department urged the agency to move the funds elsewhere.\n\n“Unfortunately, the U.S. Secret Service did not do so and the funds were thereafter stolen, something the U.S. Secret Service only discovered once it was ordered by a court to pay a portion of the seizure back to affected claimants,” a team of prosecutors wrote in an accompanying motion. The bitcoin in question was moved in July 2015 but only discovered missing in December, the affidavit said.\n\nThe Secret Service and Bridges’ attorney Steven Levin declined to comment.\n\nIn the previous case, Bridges admitted he stole money from Silk Road accounts and framed someone else for it, leading Silk Road chief Ross Ulbricht to plan a murder. Ulbricht is now serving a life sentence.', 'PILOTPROJEKT ? Einzigartiges Pionierprojekt in der Zentralschweiz: Am Schalter im Stadthaus Zug können ab sofort Dienstleistungen bis zu einem Gegenwert von 200 Franken in Bitcoins beglichen werden.\n\nVideo: Zug akzeptiert als erste Gemeinde weltweit Bitcoins\n\nSeit heute, Freitag, können in der Stadt Zug sämtliche kostenpflichtigen Dienstleistungen der Einwohnerkontrolle mit Bitcoins bezahlt werden – allerdings nur bis zu einem Gegenwert von 200 Franken. Dieses Pilotprojekt läuft bis Ende 2016, wie die Stadt Zug mitteilte.\n\nIm Anschluss daran zieht der Stadtrat ein Fazit und entscheidet darüber, ob das Projekt abgebrochen, definitiv eingeführt oder gar ausgeweitet werden soll.\n\nEtwa 0,03 Bitcoins kostet beispielsweise bei der Einwohnerkontrolle die Beglaubigung einer Unterschrift sowie die Ausstellung eines Leumundszeugnisses, einer Wohnsitzbescheinigung oder eines Heimatausweises. Nach wie vor können diese Dienstleistungen auch mit 20 Franken in bar bezahlt werden.\n\nStadtpräsident Dolfi Müller erwartet nicht, dass es schon bald hunderte von Bitcoin-Transaktionen bei der Zuger Stadtverwaltung geben wird. «Es geht uns um die Botschaft», betont er. Der Stadtrat wolle die Offenheit für die neuen Technologien zum Ausdruck bringen und frühzeitig eigene Erfahrungen sammeln.\n\nDer Stadtrat setze mit dem Projekt gegenüber den Firmen der digitalen Finanzbranche in der Region Zug ein Zeichen. Am Freitag folgten denn auch 15 Interessierte einer Einladung der Stadt zu einem Round-Table-Gespräch. Dabei ging es laut Müller nicht nur um Bitcoin-Transaktionen, sondern grundsätzlich um die Blockchain-Technologie.\n\nWeltweites Medieninteresse\n\nDer Entscheid des Zuger Stadtrates vor zwei Monaten, Bitcoins als Zahlungsmittel zuzulassen, habe zu einem «weltweiten Medieninteresse» geführt, schreibt der Stadtrat in einer Mitteilung. Selbst Fernsehstationen und renommierte Zeitungen und Zeitschriften in Deutschland und den USA hätten ausführlich über das Zuger Pionierprojekt berichtet.\n\npd/sda/chg', 'Ethereum is in a state of crisis. “The DAO” (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), a code-based and leaderless investment vehicle that crowd-funded a record-breaking 150 million USD worth of ether, was unexpectedly drowned by an unknown hacker two weeks ago. About a third of all invested ether – some 4 percent of the total ether supply – is now sitting in a so-called “Child DAO”, waiting until it can be withdrawn in another two weeks from now.\n\nThis presents the Ethereum community with a tough choice and three* main options. First, the community can decide to “do nothing” and allow the hacker to withdraw his funds. Second, the community can deploy a soft fork to freeze any funds associated with The DAO, ensuring the attacker cannot withdraw any of it*. And third, the community can deploy a hard fork to essentially “roll back” the entire existence of The DAO on a protocol-level, take back the lost funds and give it all back to the original investors.\n\nThe DAO in no way affects Bitcoin, and the choice is fundamentally to be made by the Ethereum community. But the hack and chosen solution may draw a stark and telling contrast with Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin community. Bitcoin Magazine therefore reached out to prominent bitcoiners and asked:\n\n“What should the Ethereum community do, and is this any different from what the Bitcoin community should do were a similar situation to arise?”\n\n*A newly discovered vulnerability suggests that soft forking may not be an option after all, and the only choice left is that between doing nothing and hard forking. At the time of writing of this article, not all respondends where aware of this development.\n\nStephen Pair, BitPay co-founder and CEO\n\n“The Ethereum community should ask themselves whether the fundamental premise of an Ethereum blockchain is flawed. Bitcoin transactions have a very specific purpose, and a payment system requires broad participation. An Internet scale naming system is another kind of database that might require a similar approach to Bitcoin. Most contracts, on the other hand, involve a limited set of parties that care about its state and execution. It\'s not clear to me that you need a broad participation blockchain on which to execute contracts.\n\nAs for a similar situation in Bitcoin... it\'s impossible for something like The DAO hack to occur in Bitcoin, because it would not be possible to write code for a DAO that is directly executed by Bitcoin miners.\n\nBugs in Bitcoin will occasionally cause a fork in the chain at which point miners need to reach a consensus on which path to follow. But what the Ethereum community is contemplating is a fork of the chain to bail out the users of a specific contract. The closest analogy would be the Bitcoin block chain forking because someone erroneously sent bitcoin or accidentally destroyed bitcoin. That has happened many times and no one has ever seriously suggested the Bitcoin chain should be forked as a result.”\n\nAndreas Schildbach, Bitcoin Wallet, bitcoinj and Bloq developer\n\n“I must admit I\'ve not followed the events surrounding The DAO fully, as I\'m more into Bitcoin. But I think matters are even more complicated than just a choice of whether or not to fork. As I understand it, a freeze of funds would also freeze the funds of similar DAOs. And I believe more exploitable flaws have been found by now, some of which could also be attributed to Ethereum\'s Virtual Machine itself, rather than just an application running as a smart contract... There probably is no easy way out.\n\nAs it stands, I think Ethereum should not attempt to fix or undo The DAO. No soft forks, no hard forks, and please no blacklists. Blacklists in particular would drive credibility to zero for me.”\n\nMarek Palatinus, SatoshiLabs architect and Slush Pool operator\n\n“Allowing The DAO to fund itself far beyond its $500,000 USD target was an expensive mistake. But the Ethereum community should do nothing, because it\'s not an Ethereum fault. Bugs in contracts will be quite common and we have to learn how to live with it, exactly as we live with Bitcoin thefts and hacks. If there\'s a space for code analysis tools preventing those contract bugs in the future, let them evolve.\n\nAs for Bitcoin, if there\'s ever a bug in the protocol or the reference implementation, the community should focus on resolving the bug as soon as possible, as happened with the LevelDB bug in 2013. I can even imagine blockchain rollback in a case of major security issue. But blacklisting coins or doing rollbacks because of faults not directly related to Bitcoin is unacceptable for me.”\n\nElizabeth Stark, Lightning co-founder\n\n“The Ethereum community should be more cognizant of the long term dangers of censorship and intervention at the protocol level. The meta description for their site says: \'Ethereum is a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship or third-party interference.\' The hard fork proposal, while well-intentioned, would interfere with the protocol to retrieve the DAO funds. This opens up a Pandora\'s box of other questions about why funds should be recovered in certain cases and not others, and what would happen when governments come knocking. If they go through with it, they should make it very clear that this is a one-time only fix.\n\nA similar situation is less likely for the Bitcoin community, because we structured our protocol differently. At the core of the values of Bitcoin is to keep complex functionality out of the low level protocol, as complexity is the enemy of security.\n\nThat said, if there were an issue with an application on a Layer 2 protocol, there\'s no chance the Bitcoin community would support a fork that would take currency out of circulation, or modify ownership of the currency. Even considering such a move would be preposterous to many, as it\'s in such opposition to the community values. It would defeat the purpose of having a censorship resistant protocol and ensuring the fungibility of all coins; it would go against everything we\'ve worked for the last 7 years to achieve.”\n\nManfred Karrer, Bitsquare developer\n\n“First of all, the Ethereum community should be prepared for more trouble, and not under-estimate the \'attacker.\' He seems to be very smart, and I suspect he will not give up but fight back much harder if the funds get frozen or confiscated. The failure of The DAO also questions Initial Coin Offerings. Why collect $150 million USD worth if there was no need for so much money? I also think The DAO represents an unhealthy combination of conflicts of interests for the developers, combined with a pretentious marketing campaign that suggested investors could only win.\n\nOn top of that, the Ethereum community should slow down. One argument in favor of a fork, is that a high percentage of the overall ether-supply could be in the hands of a single person, and that this would be a risk when Proof of Stake is to be introduced. But if that is indeed such a risk, it means the proposed Proof of Stake system – \'Casper\' - is completely insecure. It needs to be delayed until it can deal with a hostile whales owning large swaths of ether.\n\nFinally, regarding forks, they should do nothing. Censorship resistance is the only valid excuse for using the slow and expensive blockchain.”\n\nPaul Sztorc, Hivemind and Bloq developer\n\n“As an Ethereum-skeptic, I\'m happy to report that all options available to the Ethereum community are disastrous.\n\nThe \'soft fork idea\' probably wouldn\'t work at all: the attacker can broadcast withdrawal transactions which have multi-million dollar fees. This \'smart contract bribe\' defeats the soft fork.\n\nSimilarly, the hard fork is more impractical than it may first appear. Vitalik, and the other developers, are largely powerless. Anyone can copy their GitHub commits, and so \'old-ETH\' can keep up with \'new-ETH\' for free. Investors have no reason to choose New over Old, because they get both for free. Meanwhile, the attacker can bribe miners, on both chains, as seen above. And at least one exchange might keep Old, or trade in both. The hard fork might create two ether sets, and the resulting chaos would likely cause Old-Eth to win... defeating the hard fork.\n\nWere the hard fork to succeed, it would demonstrate centralization. The mixture of \'centralization\' and \'anonymous e-cash\' is not pretty. Key individuals may be arrested, kidnapped, or worse... and the responsible agent (\'insiders\') could short the market, and make off with tens of millions – tax free.\n\nYet, worst of all for Ethereum would be to do nothing. The DAO is, in a sense, Ethereum\'s debut. It was the first significant thing that Ethereum could do, that Bitcoin couldn\'t. It was hyped by credible people and trusted media outlets. One feature was praised above all: the ability to withdraw from the project at any time using a Child DAO (oh, the irony).\n\nThe DAO failure reveals all of these people for what they are: unqualified. And if the Ethereum team is unqualified, what does that leave, exactly? Ethereum is currently in second place – a losing position - in a winner-take-all environment. Unlike Bitcoin, it has no daily \'users\'... without faith, Ethereum can\'t survive. And why keep the faith, if the Ethereum team can\'t \'solve\' this problem?""\n\nTuur Demeester, Adamant Research editor in chief\n\n“Mt. Gox was a system built on top of Bitcoin. Because of its poor design, 7 percent of the supply at the time was stolen – versus 4 percent of Ethereum\'s supply now. A hard or soft fork to return the bitcoins was never suggested. Bitcoin, as per Satoshi\'s writings, is conceived of as digital cash, a \'digital metal\' that is as inert as gold. Users of bitcoin and gold alike are expected to understand this circumstance, and therefore understand that this great responsibility is what at the same time gives them great freedom to be in charge of their own financial futures.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum was conceived of and promoted as ‘a system that cannot care.’ Ethereum indeed doesn\'t care about The DAO. It just does what it does. It seems only fair and logical that Ethereum users shouldn\'t be forced to care about it. In other words: no freezing or reversing of funds, and no hard or soft fork for that purpose.”\n\nEric Voskuil, Libbitcoin lead developer\n\n“The people directly validating – receiving payments on an Ethereum full node - are the \'community.\' This community \'should\' do whatever the members prefer, realizing that lack of consensus can lead to their own loss. Distributed decision making is the definition of what \'should\' be done, and there can be no alternative. If everyone in a community agrees there is no problem with a change, that is the essence of consensus.\n\nThe more interesting question is: \'How large is the actual community?\' If most people defer validation to centralized systems, there is very little security against changes to the money, since these people are not part of the actual community. This will make a money unpredictable and cause people to avoid it.\n\nBitcoin can\'t be any different. Though the community is presumably larger and therefore more resistant to change.”\n\nThomas Voegtlin, Electrum lead developer\n\n“I don\'t see how something like this could happen with Bitcoin. From an investor\'s perspective, the closest we had was Mt. Gox. However, the Mt. Gox failure was not caused by a technical issue with Bitcoin itself. In contrast, The DAO situation does not seem to result solely from poor programming; the programming language used to write contracts in Ethereum should have better semantics, and be amenable to formal verification.\n\nAs it turns out, a soft fork freezing The DAO funds is no longer really an option, so the only serious way to revert the DAO hack is through a hard fork. With only 15 days remaining until the DAO funds can be spent, I doubt that consensus over such a hard fork can be achieved. It takes time to write code, have it properly audited, deploy it, and let miners signal their willingness to fork. It might therefore be safer for Ethereum to not bail out the DAO.”\n\nDavid Bailey, BTC Media CEO\n\n“Ethereum should probably do nothing, though I think a soft fork would be acceptable. A hard fork - even more so than a soft fork - turns a The DAO-only problem into an existential crisis.\n\nThis situation also exposes the potential risks of having core developers with conflicts of interest... I would be very curious to know The DAO losses of the 30 to 50 individuals that make up Ethereum\'s inner circle.\n\nAs for Bitcoin, I don\'t think it would be possible to get a contentious hard fork passed considering the amount of debate we\'ve had over a potential 2 megabyte block size limit increase. The DAO hack also validates Bitcoin\'s more conservative approach to development.\n\nI think the debate is healthy as long as the Ethereum community comes out strongly against a hard fork. This would be a sign of Ethereum-maturity.”\n\nSamson Mow, BTCC COO\n\n“In terms of utility, cryptocurrencies and game currencies – like Diablo gold – aren\'t so different from each other. The key difference is that game currencies are managed by for-profit organizations that can tweak the economy, patch design flaws, and roll back when they deem necessary to protect their vested interests. Ethereum must decide what it wants to be: a cryptocurrency or a game currency.\n\nThe Ethereum community may be in a difficult position now, but I think they only have one real choice available and that is to do nothing. This is assuming that they want to be taken seriously as a viable cryptocurrency. Choosing either a hard fork or soft fork to interfere would demonstrate that Ethereum’s blockchain is very mutable and that short term interests take priority over everything else.\n\nI really couldn\'t see a similar situation arising in Bitcoin simply because Bitcoin Core developers are very cautious in rolling out new functionality and test extensively. Moreover, Bitcoin Core’s ethos runs counter to the market intervention that is currently being encouraged by Ethereum developers.\n\nSimply put: it’s hard to imagine the Core team pushing out code intended to recover their personal losses, lost in a highly experimental project they invested in, which was poorly design and untested, that also clearly was a massive conflict of interest.”', ""Can Brexit be cryptocurrency’s moment for the Scots? Willie Fleming of the Scotcoin Project answers.\n\nIn the wake of a historic vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, Bitcoin has soared, reacting to sinking markets as confidence in the European economy temporarily faltered.\n\nScotland, meanwhile, voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, leading to predictions that the Scots will exit the UK, while not necessarily adopting the euro as their currency. This could lead to a prime situation for cryptocurrency to take firm root in Scotland.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke with Willie Fleming, the director of the Scotcoin Project, an organization meant to spur the development and adoption of Scottish cryptocurrency, about the future of crypto for Scots.\n\nCoinTelegraph: What do you think of the current state of cryptocurrency in Scotland?\n\nWillie Fleming: In its infancy, to be honest. We have the same amount of Bitcoin exposure and acceptance as in the rest of the UK - i.e. as far as the general public is concerned, there is little to no knowledge. We have an enormous education job to do.\n\nCT: Have you noticed a shift in interest with the Brexit affair, either before or after?\n\nWF: We know we have a lot of latent goodwill and with the correct communication on our part we will get the message out. Our new wallet, which is about to go into beta testing, will make an enormous difference. Much more interest in the coin, and many people contacting us wanting to buy directly for sterling. They do not want to go £->BTC ->SCOT.\n\nCT: That seems different to the usual process of acquiring other cryptocurrencies first through Bitcoin. Why is Scotcoin different in this regard?\n\nWF: Because there is little knowledge/acceptance of crypto amongst the general public. They don't know Bitcoin is the daddy and they see no reason why they should have to buy BTC, THEN buy SCOTs. We are looking for mass adoption by the public, not just the knowledgeable geeks. So our situation is quite different from most other alt-coins.\n\nCT: I have heard pro-EU friends complain about Brexit because of the short-term devaluation of the pound. Do you see the same? Are Scots looking for an alternative?\n\nWF: Well many are pissed off because most Scots will go to Eurozone destinations for their holidays. Their spending money just got cut. So, yes, an alternative would be attractive. That’s an immediate man-in-the-street effect right now before we think of any longer-term ,deeper economic consequences on jobs, pensions etc.\n\nCT: It appears that the majority of Scots voted to stay in the EU, which may signal another independence referendum from the UK is on the horizon. Do you have any plans to capitalize on that, and the inevitable money switch that will come with it, to promote Scotcoin?\n\nWF: Absolutely - we will exploit this to its fullest.\n\nCT: Any specific Scotcoin adoption plans in the works in the near future?\n\nWF: We are in talks with various retailers and agencies but due to commercial confidentiality, nothing I am allowed to disclose right now, sorry. We are in a VERY fluid situation, politically, economically and shortly constitutionally, it’s very difficult to predict outcomes for the next few weeks. The Brexiters never really expected to win and now they have they realise that what they got was not actually what they thought they were voting for.\n\nOnce we have our wallet tested and released, it is a much smaller step to develop the Till for retailers. Then we have to put a buyback scheme in place and the ‘Morning Fix’ so we can support retailers with a consistent daily exchange rate and a mechanism for buying back their Scotcoin for £\n\nCT: How did the original distribution of Scotcoin go? Do you think many still have access to their original coins?\n\nWF: All the original ‘giveaway’ was in the old pre-CounterParty coins. We know a fair number of folk successfully converted to the CP tokens, but, equally, a large number lost out. The switchover was rushed and poorly documented. That was NOT anything to do with anyone in the present team."", 'Bitcoin isn’t as anonymous as many once believed, and now researchers are using the cryptocurrency’s delivery mechanism to compile dossiers on suspected hackers.\n\nWhen a police officer in Durham, N.H., opened an innocuous looking email last spring, the small New England department became victims of a totally new kind of crime – one that it had no idea how to solve.\n\nCriminal hackers had seized the department’s entire network of 28 computers, locking police out of the system that keeps arrest records, outstanding warrants, and incident reports for 24 hours. The culprit: ransomware, a form of malicious software that encrypts a victim\'s computer files until they pay a fee via the virtual currency bitcoin.\n\nFortunately, Durham Police Chief Dave Kurz and his team had a backup server in place, allowing information technology teams to quickly restore access to the locked files. That’s not always the case, as ransomware victims risk losing their files for good if they don’t meet hackers’ demands.\n\n“We would have had to explored paying a ransom,” Chief Kurz says. “It would have been a nightmare.”\n\nTo date, ransomware attackers have operated largely without fear of being caught, thanks to their use of encryption and the decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin, which enables users to mask their identity during transactions.\n\nNow, with attacks on the rise, (the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has tracked 718,536 ransomware incidents since the Durham hack) security researchers are tracking down suspected ransomware hackers by borrowing an old technique from law enforcement: watching where the money flows. It\'s an investigative tactic so new that police in Durham wouldn\'t have been able to use it to track down the people who hacked them.\n\nBut now, says Caleb Fenton, a researcher at the cybersecurity firm Sentinel One, “You can actually follow the money.”\n\nAll bitcoin transactions are stored on a public ledger called the blockchain, where anyone can view transactions between bitcoin users. Though the blockchain users preserve their anonymity by using screen names, the public websites where payments are logged can serve as clues for investigators trying to track down ransomware criminals.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Fenton used the blockchain to gather a tremendous amount of data, including bitcoin addresses and amounts paid, as part of his own investigation into a new ransomware variant dubbed CryptXXX. That strain can also infect backup files, and hackers have already used it to extort $50,000 in bitcoin payouts from nearly 70 organizations in the past month. Fenton says he was able to determine the number of victims by tracking the payments on the blockchain.\n\nFenton says he’s found a new bitcoin wallet, used to store and access the currency, associated with CryptXXX. Since the CryptXXX-related bitcoin address first popped up in the beginning of June, Fenton says it\'s likely a new address dedicated to the campaign.\n\n“What I think we’re going to start seeing is more and more technology that allows you to trace bitcoin transactions,” he said. “Once they figure out where the command-and-control servers are, they can do a lot of information gathering tactics to figure out what [internet protocol addresses] were used, what the domains were, and who registered them.”\n\nFenton has only been able to tie the payments to blockchain screen names, not specific people, since users often utilize different addresses for each transaction. What’s more, sophisticated criminals can better anonymize their bitcoin by laundering the funds through Altcoin and other cryptocurrencies that are variants to bitcoin.\n\nStill, blockchain is the type of tool that experts hope will eventually lead to more arrests. Investigators could track the extortion payments to physical bitcoin exchange locations, where users convert the virtual currency to cash, and apprehend suspects, or catch them on surveillance footage, suggests Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, a Washington think tank focused on bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\n“Old fashioned police work is always going to be the main method of investigation,” said Mr. Van Valkenburgh. “Anonymity is not the tool that makes bitcoin palatable to criminals. It’s just very fast, it’s reversible, and it’s a lower cost to use than other payments systems, like mailing pre-paid credit cards.”\n\nBitcoin has become the most popular currency used to fund transactions on the Dark Web, the hidden criminal underbelly of the internet, since the popular online drug market known as the Silk Road emerged in 2011. Today, though conversion rates vary, bitcoins can sell for more than $600 each. The virtual currency remains in use by other drug markets, legitimate online retailers, venture capitalists, and is being explored for use by the British government.\n\nUS government investigators are on the case, too. The Department of Justice briefly disrupted the ransomware scheme known as CryptoLocker, and identified the suspects who allegedly stole more than $100 million as part of the scheme. That single ransomware variant may have infected as many as 260,000 computers around the world, according to Richard Downing, US acting deputy assistant attorney general.\n\n“Despite these many challenges, law enforcement is actively working to disrupt and defeat ransomware schemes,” Mr. Downing said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in May. “The FBI currently has over 30 active investigations into different ransomware variants.” The FBI did not respond to requests for comment on this story.\n\nGovernment investigators also leveraged bitcoin payments as part of the Silk Road investigation. After agents apprehended Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, they accessed his computer to find sizable transactions to two unknown sources. Authorities say both of those trails led to corrupt federal agents who, along with investigating the Silk Road, also appeared to be taking bitcoin for themselves.\n\n“The mere existence of these corrupt government agents was determined to be true by the blockchain,” said Coin Center\'s Van Valkenburgh.\n\nSuccess like that has led to a small marketplace of bitcoin intelligence firms cropping up all over the world, attracting a significant influx of cash from the venture capital world. British blockchain firm Elliptic has already raised $5 million for services to monitor the platform for criminal investigations. And the firm Chainanalysis has raised $1.6 million, and will help assisting Europol in investigations.\n\n“You’re putting your transactions on an immutable ledger that will never disappear,"" says Van Valkenburgh. ""You can’t eliminate that feature of the blockchain – you’re potentially exposing your entire criminal conspiracy to an audit.""', 'Zug\'s mayor, Dolfi Müller, was surprised by the considerable media response. The city council was simply looking for a creative way to grease Zug\'s economy, ""With Bitcoin, we\'re sending a message: We in Zug want to get out in front of future technologies,"" he told DW.\n\nThe council only realized in hindsight that their decision would make history. Zug is the first locality in the world to accept the digital currency. It\'s a humble start; payments are limited to the equivalent of 200 Swiss francs. Müller wanted to keep risk low while Zug tests the waters, he\'s aware of the controversy surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nSome argue the digital currency isn\'t secure enough for civilian use. Bitcoin\'s market price is volatile and scammers are still all too common. To mitigate this insecurity, all Bitcoin payments in Zug are immediately converted into the Swiss currency. ""That\'s what the stock exchange is for,"" says Müller, ""it saves us from losing huge amounts in nanoseconds.""\n\nMore than just scenic - Zug wants to become a Bitcoin pioneer.\n\nFeline micro-finance with Bitcoin\n\nZug is a picturesque Swiss town complete with a lake and panoramic views of the Alps. The taxes are low, but rent is through the roof. The population is international. Maybe that\'s why Bitcoin enjoys near universal approval among Zug\'s residents. There were few complaints as to the opacity of the origins of Bitcoins.\n\nOn the contrary, many people find Bitcoin transactions refreshing because they cut out a middleman - the banks. One woman is organizing a project to castrate stray cats on the island of Santorini. To expect to receive large donations for this project is naïve, she says. Instead, she\'s turning to micro-finance, which Bitcoin is perfect for because it skirts banks fees.\n\nBitcoins at the dentist\n\nHowever, Bitcoin still hasn\'t found its way into day-to-day transactions. Hotels, stores and restaurants don\'t accept the currency. Abbas Hussain-Probst is the exception. The dentist offers his patients the opportunity to rid themselves of toothache with Bitcoins instead of francs.\n\nBut according to the dentist, public trust in Bitcoin is still low. Only a handful of his patients have paid with Bitcoin in the past year, and all of them work in IT. Of course, these are the people Zug\'s city council had in mind when they began accepting the digital currency.\n\nMoving toward a \'Crypto Valley\'\n\nAbout 20 fintech companies have recently settled in Zug and neighboring Baar, including Bitcoin Suisse. The company has servers up in the Alps that run highly complex mathematical functions to mine new Bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin - digital currency with a lot of potential, but still not fully trusted among consumers around the world\n\nTo help popularize Bitcoins, the company also runs a number of Bitcoin-ATMs. One stands in Kafi Schoffel, a restaurant in Zürich. In exchange for francs or euros, the machine spits out a nondescript strip of paper with a QR code on it. This code, when scanned by a smartphone, can be used as payment. Kafi Schoffel customers use them to buy cappuccinos.\n\nNiklas Nikolajsen, CEO of Bitcoin Suisse, predicts it will still take a number of years before digital currencies enjoy widespread use. But he\'s sure the day will come when everyone buys their cappuccinos with Bitcoins. Nikolajsen says digital currencies reduce barriers to the global economy, ""A taxidriver in Nairobi might be unable to accept credit cards because of high fees, but all he has to do is buy a five-dollar smartphone to accept Bitcoins.""', 'Bank payment networks to prevail over bitcoin - Citi\n\nBitcoin does not as yet pose a threat to existing centralised payment networks, argues Citibank in a new research report, dismissing the digital currency as an interesting experiment with limited use cases for peer-to-peer transfers.\n\nThe bank\'s research team cites problems like scalability, network adoption and lack of a legal/regulatory framework for dispute resolution as drawbacks to more widespread adoption of the virtual currency.\n\n\n\nThe report points to social payments network Circle, financial inclusion outfit BitPesa, and B2B remittance firm Abra as companies developing interesting niche business cases for bitcoin, but argues that no-one has yet to build a killer app that could propel the crypto-currency into the mainstream.\n\n\n\nThe authors dispute the idea that bitcoin can provide a cheaper, frictionless payments experience compared to established infrastructures.\n\n\n\n""Since the network incurs substantial energy-related costs due to proof-of-work, we believe that these costs will eventually be borne by the users through high transaction fees, which will make it more expensive than centralized networks,"" the report states.\n\n\n\nAnd while a central bank-backed digital currency could pose a disruptive threat to current bank operations, Citi views this as an improbable ""long-tail"" risk.\n\n\n\nA more likely long-term future for bitcoin may lie in integration with machine-to-machine payments supporting applications in the Internet of Things.\n\n\n\nStates the report: ""We believe an open network like bitcoin combined with mobile, machine learning, big data and the Internet of Things has the potential to create radically new models.""', 'In what could be a second revolution for China, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, online gaming tokens and other data-based information could establish itself as ‘Civil Rights’ Objects in this far eastern country.\n\nThe new civil code which is contained in the upcoming General Provisions Draft would give Chinese citizens recourse to legal remedy in case their Bitcoin or other digital assets are stolen This is similar to current legal options and is applicable to personal information being leaked, hacked or stolen.\n\nThe proposed new civil code\n\nThe General Provisions Draft was made public on the 12th National People’s Congress in Beijing on June 27, 2016.\n\nAccording to China’s Xinhua News Agency’s website, Zhang Dejiang Chairman of the National People’s Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, presided over the session.\n\nChina’s national broadcaster CCTV quoted Xu Xianming of the NPC Standing Committee as saying:\n\n""The general principles of the civil law emphasize equality and justice, reflecting and guiding our Chinese national spirit, social core value and morality. The principles meet the needs of the market system. The priorities for improving the legal system in modern times is to protect people\'s civil rights, including individuals\' freedom and dignity.""\n\nImpact on Digital Assets\n\nBitcoin.com reported that as per China’s Civil Law private property is defined as legal income, real estate, deposits, livelihood applicances, historical relics, books and materials, forests and woods, livelistock, and other means of production granted by laws and other legal properties.\n\nThe problem in China is that until recently there has been no clarity on non-tangible goods, but lately these items have started becoming assets for Chinese and other citizens as well.\n\nChina and Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is certainly one of those assets which takes this sort of form. It is important to note that in 2013 The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China’s central bank and associated five ministeries, issued a statement titled ‘The Notification on Preventing Bitcoin Risk’.\n\nIt states:\n\n“It is required that, at this stage, financial and payment institutions may not use Bitcoin pricing for products or services, may not buy or sell Bitcoins, may not act as a central counterparty in Bitcoin trading, may not offer insurance products associated with Bitcoin, may not provide direct or indirect Bitcoin-related services to customers, including: registering, trading, settling, clearing or other services; accepting Bitcoin or the use of Bitcoin as a clearing tool; trading Bitcoin with CNY or foreign currencies; storing, escrowing, and mortgaging in Bitcoin; issuing Bitcoin-related financial products, and using Bitcoin as a means of investment for trusts and funds.”\n\nHowever, this statement in its full form did not shed any clarity on the official position of the Chinese government and China remains a place where Bitcoin can be used but Chinese miners have also come to dominate the Bitcoin scene.\n\nWill Bitcoin become People’s Right?\n\nSince the new code has not come into force, the status quo remains but in future it is likely that Bitcoin will become a legal entity of sorts in China.\n\nArticle 104 of the draft which is under consideration says that objects including immovables and movables, specific rights or virtual properties which are defined as ‘property rights objects’ by law shall be treated accordingly.\n\nThe new General Provisions Draft will enable Bitcoin holders to pursue legal channels in case of loss of ‘property’ in the same way as the theft of tangible goods is pursued. This means that while the virtual currency may not be treated as legal tender, it will be assigned the role of a valuable by law and citizens will have some recourse.\n\nThere are some issues that have not still been addressed by the General Provisions Draft, such as whether the value of stolen property would be calculated from when it was stolen or when it was recovered. Other minor issues like valuations among different exchanges etc have also not been addressed.\n\nIn the end it can be said that Bitcoin will have some legal standing in China if the new draft does become enacted into a civil code.', 'GB, July 1, 2016 at 15:37 UTC\n\nSpaceBTC, a European Bitcoin exchange 3.0 based in London, UK, has been launched.

The company has secured a location with low-cost hydro power to establish a facility to generate more than two PetaHash in processing power.\n\nThe facility will be completely operational by Aug. 1, the company noted in a press release, and can expand to nearly 10 PetaHash. MGT Capital believes it can become a domestic leader in cryptocurrency mining.\n\nMGT Capital is led by John McAfee, who is considered a cyber security pioneer and is a one-time Libertarian Party presidential contender.

07/02/2016,"[""Jim Harper is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Harper reflects on recent elements of the bitcoin scaling debate and what it means for perceptions of the digital currency's viability.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t care. It continues to develop a monetary, financial, economic, intellectual, and social ecosystem around itself. But a pair of reports in the mainstream media makes Bitcoin look broken. Arguing with the messenger is an option. But the better path is to get on with the hard work of fixing up Bitcoin in perception and reality.\n\nUnfair? Perhaps. A Planet Money podcast finding that Bitcoin wouldn’t relay a simple transaction appears to have been conducted on software that didn’t supply the fee required under current conditions. In light of such reports, new users may hesitate to get involved. Their reluctance may retard Bitcoin’s growth and slow desirable advances in global financial inclusion, financial privacy, autonomy, and monetary and financial stability, as well as Bitcoin’s growth in value on exchanges worldwide.\n\nFor Bitcoin’s technical sophisticates, doing a transaction that way is just dumb. But there is a good argument that transaction fees were supposed to supplant mined bitcoins over the next hundred years. Wallet software and the knowledge to use it in a market for transaction-inclusion services were arguably meant to evolve over that span, not in the last year.\n\nSo if New York Times reporter Nathanial Popper was playing the role of everyman when he sent his transaction to oblivion, he represented a large number of Bitcoin users and a huge number of non-users. The technical and social capital for transaction fees is still in the earliest stages of development.\n\nIn his Times piece on mining in China, Popper sounded notes that must surely rankle Bitcoin Core developers and their supporters. He characterized them as having “resisted changing the software,” when in fact they’ve been working hard to optimize the software for their preferred 1MB blocksize limit.\n\nNow Bitcoin is broken – at least in the eyes of millions of New York Times readers and Planet Money listeners. It is looking to them like Bitcoin is a technically constrained payment system that is hard to use.\n\nWhat to do? The expression “never argue with someone who buys ink by the barrel” needs updating, but its import is unchanged. When the ink hits the paper or the editor hits “publish,” what’s done is done.\n\nBitcoin Core’s philosophy and plans are not well understood. The community around Core has not communicated effectively with Popper and others outside their circle. They have yet to establish in the popular mind that they have a vision for a fully secure Bitcoin ecosystem with capacity to rival or supplant today’s dominant payment and monetary systems.\n\nSome in the Chinese mining community may share these concerns. At the time of this writing, rumors are swirling that a recent meeting in China produced an agreement to shift away from Core to a software version that supports bigger block sizes.\n\nThere are reasons why they might make this change. Core offers miners increased fees, which are surely welcome (if constraining, as Popper’s reporting suggests). Over the long term, Core’s plan for off-chain transactions would diminish the role of the blockchain, with uncertain results for miners.\n\nThe alternative, a bigger blocksize and greater on-blockchain through-put, doesn’t promise much in near-term fees. But it does support the simple vision of a massive blockchain-based payment system, supported by increasingly valuable digital money.\n\nCore may offer miners the role of “big fish in a small pond.” Bitcoin Classic might make miners big fish in a big pond. For the Core side, of course, that skates dangerously close to mining centralization, which threatens Bitcoin’s very foundations.\n\nThere is no way forward but forward. Miners, node operators, and ordinary Bitcoin users should constantly assess whether the software version they run is the best for the ecosystem and themselves. Proponents of different software versions should make their cases in the most persuasive terms they can. This means open debate that avoids rancor, personal attacks, technical attacks, and censorship.\n\nWhy is it important to conduct the debate on a high plane? The third actor. The blocksize debate is not just about competing versions of Bitcoin’s philosophy, future, and software. It is an exhibition for non-Bitcoin-users about the type of people that adopt cryptocurrency. Every side in the blocksize debate is displaying to the wider world what the “crypto world” is like.\n\nBitcoin is not broken, though news reports may have convinced some people that it is. The goal of stalwarts on any side of the development debates must be to ensure that their own actions help rehabilitate Bitcoin’s public image and don’t bring down what they are working so hard to build.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity is never solved. Compared to much of what follows, this all seems pretty reasonable and plausible.\n\nMay 2010 The first real-world Bitcoin purchase occurs: 10,000 btc, currently valued at ~$6.5 million, is used to purchase two large Papa John’s pepperoni pizzas in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nEarly Spring 2011 The rest of the world (including me) discovers Bitcoin. Reactions range from “this is a giant scam” to “the most dangerous project we’ve ever seen” to “this is our greatest hope for liberty” to “OMG, they’re all totally crazy.” Each of these contradictory viewpoints is surprisingly convincing.\n\nSpring 2011 Bitcoin is widely castigated for being primarily used to purchase drugs on darknet sites such as Silk Road. The traditional reaction to moral censure ensues: the price of Bitcoin immediately rises almost forty-fold in 10 weeks.\n\nJune 2011 Bitcoin promptly falls back from $32 to $10.\n\nJune 2011 Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange originally set up to trade Magic: The Gathering cards, is hacked.\n\nJune 2011 People keep using Mt. Gox, because, you know, what the heck, why not? What could possibly go wrong?\n\nAutumn 2011 The price of Bitcoin has fallen back down to $2.\n\nMarch 12, 2013 Most Bitcoin aficionados will tell you, in a tone usually reserved for tales of deaths, wars, famines and pestilences, that this is the day a “hard fork” occurred on the Bitcoin blockchain. In actual fact, there has never been a Bitcoin hard fork.\n\nApril 2013 Bitcoin skyrockets back up to $100.\n\nJuly 2013 The infamous Winklevii twins launch the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund. They found out about Bitcoin at a party on Ibiza. I am not making this up.\n\nNovember 2013 Bitcoin hits $250.\n\nNovember 2013 Bitcoin hits $500.\n\nNovember 2013 Bitcoin hits $1,000.\n\nDecember 2013 Bitcoin crashes back below $600.\n\nJanuary 2014 The New York Times publishes “Why Bitcoin Matters” by Marc Andreessen, who argues (correctly) that “Bitcoin offers a sweeping vista of opportunity to reimagine how the financial system can and should work in the Internet era, and a catalyst to reshape that system in ways that are more powerful for individuals and businesses alike.” Meanwhile, however, much of the early Bitcoin community is still using Mt. Gox, the Magic: the Gathering trading-card site turned Bitcoin exchange coded in PHP by developers of extremely dubious technical ability.\n\nFebruary 2014 Mt. Gox shuts down and files for bankruptcy, reporting the loss of 850,000 bitcoin, or about 7 percent of all extant at the time. Some weeks later they rediscover ~200,000 of those bitcoin behind a couch cushion.\n\nMarch 2014 A train set aficionado named Dorian Nakamoto is “outed” by Newsweek as the creator of Bitcoin. It is soon apparent that Newsweek is flagrantly, painfully, stupidly wrong.\n\nJanuary 2015 Bitcoin slips to $200 during a period of merciful boredom, during which serious people, genuinely interested in using its remarkable decentralized/permissionless technology to change the world for the better, pour an enormous amount of time, money and resources into initiatives to do just that.\n\nBasically all of 2015 The Bitcoin world is riven by a bitter, personal and vicious debate over an arcane (but important) technical issue that hamstrings the network to no more than seven transactions per second, and will require a hard fork — and, arguably, greater network centralization — to completely fix. Its developer community fragments into two chief camps: Sharks and Jets, later renamed Core and Classic. This division makes it impossible to ignore the fact that the supposedly permissionless and decentralized cryptocurrency is de facto controlled by a handful of mining pools and a tiny coterie of developers. Previously the community has dealt with this inconvenient truth by loudly singing “la la la la!” while studiously looking away.\n\nApril 2015 Mt. Gox co-founder Jed McCaleb, who, to his credit, left Mt. Gox long before it disintegrated in a bubble of recrimination and humiliation, and who went on to create two new (non-blockchain) cryptocurrencies, Ripple and Stellar, is sued by Ripple for selling Ripple, allegedly because he couldn’t sell Stellar to support Stellar.\n\nAugust 2015 Ethereum, a new cryptocurrency basically founded on the precept that Bitcoin has been timid and unambitious, or at least insufficiently brash, weird and disruptive, launches its first phase into the world. Its distinguishing factor: the scripting language that controls its monetary transfers is Turing-complete, which means, by definition, that it is impossible to tell whether its programs will run forever or eventually halt. Ethereum deals with this problem by charging “gas,” a unit of its own currency, for every computation. To analogize, Bitcoin offers its developers a knife with which to stab themselves; Ethereum offers them the entire arsenal of the United States military with which to destroy everything that they have ever loved, but makes them pay by the second to use it. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is both technically fascinating and generally awesome. And, again like Bitcoin, it promptly attracts a coterie of dollar-sign-eyed enthusiasts who are … shall we say … somewhat less awesome.\n\nDecember 2015 An Australian man known as Craig Wright is “outed” as Satoshi Nakamoto. It soon becomes painfully apparent that either Wright is a con man, or “Satoshi” is doing absolutely everything he can to convince the world he is a con man. Occam’s Razor makes it pretty clear which way to bet.\n\nJanuary 2016 Mike Hearn, a senior Bitcoin developer, announced that Bitcoin has failed, and loudly and publicly quits the community (with a Medium post, of course).\n\nJanuary 2016 Blocksize debate (correctly) resolved, Bitcoin embarks on a long bull run and continues to gain in value, without ever really resolving the dark fundamental self-contradiction at its heart.\n\nApril 2016 Slock.it, a German startup that creates “slocks” — smart locks that open when they receive money, just like the toll door in Philip K. Dick’s dystopian Ubik — announces a side project: the world’s first Distributed Autonomous Organization, built on Ethereum, a computer program that will raise ether and then invest it based on its funders’ votes, with no further human decisions or intervention required. Their announcement refers, in a soon-to-be-ironic self-congratulatory manner, to irrefutable computer code … reviewed by the best security audit company in the world … self-governing and not influenced by outside forces: its software operates on its own, with its by-laws immutably written on the blockchain, not controlled by its creators …\n\nMay 2016 People claim, with an apparently straight face, “The DAO Will Soon Become The Greatest Threat Banks Have Ever Faced.” Optimistic investors pour a whopping $150 million (at then-current exchange rates) into the DAO, because, you know, what the heck, why not? What could possibly go wrong? A few skeptical people like, er, me (and pretty much everyone I know) write things like “What most concerns me about the Ethereum project is security. … Ethereum offers a vastly larger attack surface than Bitcoin … this applies not just to the network itself, but to individual Ethereum contracts.” DAO enthusiasts are angered by us.\n\nMay 2016 Craig Wright, the aforementioned Australian sure-looks-like-a-con-man, outs himself as Satoshi Nakamoto, and even manages to convince Gavin Andresen, a major Bitcoin figure and developer. (Con men can be very convincing in person.) But after a flurry of media attention, it soon becomes painfully apparent, again, that either Wright is a con man, or “Satoshi” is doing absolutely everything he can to convince the world he is a con man. Occam’s Razor continues to make it pretty clear which way to bet.\n\nMay 2016 Some well-respected researchers identify fundamental flaws in the DAO’s voting protocol and call for a moratorium on DAO projects until these are resolved.\n\nJune 2016 A potential flaw in Ethereum smart-contract scripts is identified in the DAO and, everyone is assured, quickly fixed.\n\nJune 2016 The DAO is hacked; nearly a third of its money is siphoned away into a “split DAO.” Who could possibly have seen that one coming?\n\nJune 2016 The very same people who until recently were trumpeting “irrefutable computer code … not influenced by outside forces … not controlled by its creators” immediately call for the intervention of creators and outside forces to repair the damage caused by the computer code. To their credit, they seem fairly embarrassed about this. A “soft fork” to ensure the attacker can’t make away with the drained funds is proposed, as is a much more drastic “hard fork” to return the funds to investors. Someone purporting to be the attacker appears in the DAO slack channel claiming they’ll bribe miners to oppose the soft fork. Needless to say, one way or another, the DAO will be DAOing no more.\n\nJune 2016 The august London Review of Books publishes a 35,000-word piece about Craig Wright (remember him?) which serves primarily as a vivid example of why technically incompetent writers should not attempt technically dense subjects. Sarah Jeong hilariously eviscerates it with one of the most caustic tweetstorms I have ever encountered. Meanwhile, Wright’s long game is explained, when he files dozens of Bitcoin-related patents.\n\nJune 2016 Emin Gün Sirer, a Cornell professor and one of the researchers who identified flaws in the DAO’s voting proposal, and an early identifier (and explainer) of the exploit that led to the DAO hack — for which he was apparently falsely accused of being the attacker by Slock.it — points out that the proposed fix opens Ethereum to a troubling Denial-of-Service attack. The soft fork is called off … for now.\n\nPress time A rumor sweeps through the Bitcoin community that a supermajority of Chinese miners — which is to say, a majority of all miners — has suddenly decided to reject Bitcoin Core in favor of previously spurned Bitcoin Classic. This rumor is, to understate, thus far unsubstantiated.', ""Citigroup, in its latest report, doesn't consider bitcoin to be a threat to the payments and financial services industry. Read more...\n\nThe rise in Bitcoin adoption and companies offering Bitcoin-based payment products is not going to affect the conventional payments industry anytime soon. The leading players in payments industry will continue to enjoy their dominance, states a recent report by Citigroup.\n\nThe report, released a couple of days ago analyzes both payments industry and the digital currency industry to conclude that Bitcoin is not a threat to the likes of MasterCard and Visa. However, the report does not dispute the fact that the use of blockchain technology will open up markets for financial services, helping them reach new customers.\n\nBitcoin and Existing Payment Solutions\n\nBitcoin currently has a market capitalization of over $10.8 billion, making it strong enough to be taken seriously by the banking and financial services industry. Many banks and financial companies consider the digital currency to be a threat. However, the current state of bitcoin payments leaves much to be desired. The Citigroup considers Bitcoin to be a successful proof of concept for decentralized peer-to-peer fund transfer and payments network. According to the report, the only benefit offered by the Bitcoin network over existing payments solutions is anonymity (let’s make it clear that bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous at best).\n\nWhile Citigroup dismisses bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by saying it doesn’t see any potential for disruption, it states that the digital currencies issued by central banks may change the whole payments industry. However, there is no indication of any central bank issuing digital currency any time soon.\n\nThe report also touches upon the role of bitcoin in remittance. Bitcoin is known to offer a faster and much cheaper mode of remittance compared to conventional remittance services. But Citi lists last mile delivery as an issue as the conversion of bitcoin to fiat currency may turn out to be costly for recipients and remittance companies transmitting fiat in the form of digital currency over Bitcoin network.\n\nEven though the Citi analysts state that the digital currency and digital currency based financial services companies are not a threat to the traditional ways, they acknowledge few rising startups in the sector which have already made a name for themselves. The business models adopted by Circle, BitPesa and Abra are also discussed in detail in the report.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Citigroup is also heavily invested in Blockchain technology. The financial giant is part of the R3CEV led international banking consortium for blockchain technology.\n\nImage: AOL"", 'Australia\'s Flux Party wants democracy to be more like technology.\n\nBuilt on the idea that cryptocurrency tokens riding on a blockchain network can act as a platform for online voting, the Flux Party is seeking to lower the hurdles for passing legislation, thereby helping governments better keep pace in today’s connected, fast-growing world.\n\nMore broadly, though, the minor political party wants government to operate in a constant state of change, and to use blockchain technology to deliver on this goal.\n\nAccording to co-founder of the Flux Party Max Kaye, the main problem with politics is that it’s stagnant and slow-moving, an environment where those that make it to the top, stay at the top, and those who make it prefer wheeling and dealing for their benefit to doing good for the people.\n\nThis is especially prominent in Australia, the Flux Party contends, where corruption is rampant and constituents are disillusioned with those currently in power. As evidence, the group cites how the two major political parties opposed a federal commission against corruption like the state-based Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC).\n\nThe Flux movement is all about the reorganization of power and direct empowerment, a similar goal to most cryptocurrency projects. Although many times, these things are easier said than accomplished.\n\nCryptocurrency projects that have tried similar initiatives have been plagued by governance issues, often trying to give everyone a say no matter how educated or emotional they are about a particular topic.\n\nFor instance, bitcoin enthusiasts are still split on relatively minor protocol details such as the size of its transaction blocks, and since The DAO got attacked, some in the ethereum community want to pursue technical changes to regain control of lost user funds. Others think that would be an overstep of the ethereum team’s power, but complicating matters is that the network lacks an effective or inclusive governance process dictating how this decision will be made.\n\nBut Kaye and his co-founder, Nathan Spataro have thought a lot about such issues and believe they have novel solutions.\n\nIn Kaye’s mind, the systems could work like this: If a lot of constituents decided not to vote on allowing the death penalty because they didn’t think it would ever get passed, and then it does, a new ballot could go out the next day. And because the death penalty is very much disavowed in Australia, people would turn out to vote to undo that.\n\nPreventing a Brexit\n\nIt’s envisioned as a highly reactive system, one that some UK citizens might wish they had. After some \'Brexit\' – the UK referendum to vote to leave or remain a part of the European Union – supporters came out saying they regret their decision as the economic repercussions of the country’s uncertainty magnifies.\n\nAnd, according to Kaye, the Flux Party’s democracy-as-a-service platform is impregnable to corruption. Within the platform, every constituent gets one voting token per issue that can be spent for a ""yes"" or ""no"".\n\nThere are also tokens called ‘political points’ that can be traded if a constituent doesn’t want to vote on a particular issue and instead wants to give his or her vote to another person. Political points can also be used to put an issue forward for a vote.\n\n""We try and isolate the monetary economy from the voting economy,"" Kaye remarked.\n\nThe Flux Party adds opportunity cost into the equation to stop people from voting randomly for issues they are not well-versed in or don’t care about. Because users can gain political points by not voting, they are given positive reinforcement to vote only on issues they care about.\n\nIt\'s a bit like an auction where individuals can make bids on voting tokens not being used. Political points will be created all the time and then distributed equally among all users.\n\nIn an effort to dissuade speculation, the tokens cannot be exchanged for real-world value such as fiat money, which should also discourage electoral training or the means of buying votes, a process banned in many countries and looked down upon in most others.\n\n""We go to great lengths to make sure this is a very egalitarian project that gives everyone a say,"" said Kaye. ""It’s like capitalism if you had a large tax on income plus a basic income as well.”\n\nVote for idealism\n\nCurrently, the Flux Party is aiming to get one representative in Tasmania\'s Senate during the 2nd July election. In Australia, he said, this isn’t such a long shot since someone can get elected with as little as 14,000 votes.\n\nWhile Flux’s membership is currently only 3,048, it’s one of the more popular minor parties in the country. And Kaye says the party is starting a $25,000 social media campaign in the weeks leading up to the election.\n\nThroughout the rest of the year, the Flux Party will be putting representatives up in state elections and council-level elections. The candidates are all volunteers (plus Kaye and Spataro), but none of these participants will be voting with their consciences.\n\nInstead the representatives will vote in proportion to how their constituents vote on the Flux platform. For example, if 50% of constituents vote in favor of a bill and 50% vote against a bill, three Flux representatives will vote for and three will vote against.\n\nIn an effort to keep the Flux platform decentralized, the platform will anchor all votes to the bitcoin blockchain. This decision, they argue, keeps Kaye and the Flux startup out of a powerful role holding the voter data.\n\nThe startup will use a distributed hash table that’s stored off chain which is linked to one hash stored in a bitcoin transaction that can represent a million votes.\n\nWhile this may sound esoteric, and many reports have called the Flux Party\'s antics – running on a platform of parliamentary reform instead of the traditional platform of jobs and growth, etc – idealistic, Kaye thinks it’s more pragmatic than a starry-eyed vision of an equitable future.\n\n""If we’re right, this is the sort of thing that makes democracy 10 times better than what we have now,"" he said, adding:\n\n""It’s worth the gamble.""\n\nBailey Reutzel is a veteran finance reporter, most recently covering the intersection of tech and finance for PaymentsSource.\n\nHer latest project Moneytripping is a Gonzo-style journalism project focused on exploring money, politics and finance in America.\n\nAustralian parliament image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

We hope to bring them here and show the Chinese audience, including industry and regulators, what is going on outside and bring our foreign friends into China to show them what’s going on within China.”\n\nA confirmed list of over 40 speakers from diverse backgrounds includes representatives from Microsoft, UBS, Santander, Ernest & Young and many others, as well as prominent blockchain experts from Ethereum, HyperLedger, R3, Ethcore, Circle, ConsenSys, OpenBazaar, Zcash, and more.\n\nThe International Blockchain Week is hosted by Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, funded by Wanxiang Holdings, one of China’s giant conglomerates and China’s biggest backer of blockchain technology which has been prolifically involved in this space, launching in late 2015 a $50 million blockchain focused venture capital fund, Fenbushi Capital.\n\nThey have been instrumental in bringing blockchain technology to China with a Wanxiang Blockchain Labs spokesman stating to CCN that:\n\n“[B]anks, government, and other financial institutions started to pay attention to blockchain (not just Bitcoin) only since our first conference last year in Shanghai.”\n\nFollowing Shanghai’s Global Blockchain Summit in October last year, interest in blockchain technology exploded all over the world, reaching fever pitch in the west. Although media attention has somewhat subsided, a spate of new investments by Chinese companies suggests that interest in blockchain tech is now heating up in the world’s second biggest economy.\n\nJust in the last few weeks, numerous blockchain related announcements have come out from financial institutions and Chinese giant tech companies. Baidu, China’s Google, backed a $60 million investment round in Circle alongside several Chinese strategic investors, including banks. Tencent, one of China’s biggest internet company and owners of WeChat joined a financial blockchain consortium with 30 other finance and tech firms. Meanwhile, Ping An Bank, one of China’s financial conglomerates, joined R3.\n\nThe above is supplemented by a seemingly change in attitude by Chinese regulators which recently announced a new draft law protecting virtual assets in the same way as physical or other financial assets. Although it is not clear whether the new law fully extends to blockchain based assets, such as smart contract tokens or blockchain ledger entries registering property, the worldwide recognition of blockchain’s innovative potential as well as the involvement of Chinese giant tech companies and financial institutions is likely to foster a much more welcoming regulatory environment, following in London’s footsteps and US’s, which is currently undergoing through a “responsible innovation” consultation period to update decades and at times centuries old Fintech regulations.\n\nShanghai’s International Blockchain Week is likely to be the biggest event of 2016 as the world gathers to reflect on the year blockchain took center stage and looks forward to another year of disruptive innovation in finance and technology.\n\nThere has been “a lot of progress overall in China in such a short time indeed and we hope this can develop into something concrete and beneficial to the financial industry,” stated Wanxiang Blockchain Labs’ spokesman, who further added that the conference will have a number of announcements, including from Chinaledger, an alliance of 11 regional commodity exchanges, equity exchanges and financial asset exchanges led by Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, which is adding new experts and several new members.\n\nThe conference will further dedicate an entire day to demos where entrepreneurs can showcase their blockchain products and perhaps give us one of those rare moments when a brand new product is showed to the world as the blockchain race to bring this new innovation to the high street continues.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Three separate online petitions have been opened by individuals who have reportedly lost their investments in the defunct HashOcean Bitcoin mining company. They are seeking to get the interest of the relevant transborder crimes department of law enforcement agencies such as the FBI, CIA, Interpol and MI6.\n\nThe petitions include FBI - EUA: FIND HASHOCEAN.COM by Hugo Trombini in Brazil, FBI - EUA - CIA - MI-6 - INTERPOL: FIND OWNER HASHOCEAN.COM by Adam A. from the United Kingdom and FBI And Interpol Hashocean 700,000 people swindled by Gonzalo D. from Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina. The three campaigns have gathered over a thousand signatures so far.\n\nHugo Trombini has also opened a Facebook page Find Hashocean where he seeks to gain support of other HashOcean scam victims on the need to ‘centralize information’ to achieve a common goal which is to get those behind the website.\n\nVictims’ plea for help\n\nTrombini, for example, says he has made efforts to contact organizations of interest with the hope of sharing the information he has, including IP addresses and contact details. With these details he thinks it will help to trace and locate those behind the vanished site.\n\nHis petition campaign says:\n\n“The website HashOcean.com is off-line and took with them millions of dollars from approximately 700,000 users worldwide. Since there are neither regulating institutions nor reliable sources of information, we have decided to open this channel to all users and supporters of cloud mining - people who believe in a transparent mining process. We created this petition to be able to ask the FBI and other similar institutions to trace those in charge of www.HashOcean.com - Cloud Mining. 700,000 users want their money back and the supporters of Cloud Mining deserve a reliable mining process. If you lost money with www.HashOcean.com - Cloud Mining or you are simply a cryptocurrency supporter, please help us to raise awareness and get specialist help to trace the people responsible for HashOcean.com. Please sign the petition and forward to as many people as possible in all social medias. Let´s unite and raise awareness as soon as possible.”\n\nWhy start the petition?\n\nIn a Facebook chat with CoinTelegraph, Trombini said he started the campaign because he had lost about $10,000 dollars - everything he had and six months of work: “I see others want justice, so I started to search for my own.”\n\nOn why he directed his petition to the FBI and what he expects them to do he said:\n\n“The first thing I thought was: they have a well-structured department. They have a large team for these sorts of cases. As crypto coins are a money of the world, I think they don’t want this money to go into arms and drugs, and neither do I. So I think many people put all this money into the system and now they are very sad.”\n\nHe said he will be disappointed if the FBI does not find the HashOcean team or choose not to find them.\n\nHe explains:\n\n“If they find them, we will then have an example and we can create some parameters to determine if a site or a mining cloud company is a scam or not. We have to set minimum rules to trust a website or a cloud mining site like a registry or something to tell us that this farm is working ok. So if the FBI can’t find or don’t want to find them, I think then anyone can create their own scam, and nothing will happen to them.”\n\nHoashocean.com now worth $44 million\n\nAccording to Kypertech hackers, the HashOcean.com site is now worth $44m and is up for grabs. In response to a claim that says the group’s Polish hacker could be hacking the original HashOcean website, the group posts on its Facebook page:\n\n“Wow! So now people are blaming us for \u202a#\u200ehashocean\u202c shutting down while we have been doing nothing but trying to fix things!?! Our Polish hacker didn't even touch their website until AFTER IT WAS DOWN. People will say anything to get a fix nowadays. We did not originally ‘hack’ hashocean. THEY PARKED THEIR DOMAIN AND ARE TRYING TO SELL IT WHICH, IF WE MIGHT ADD, IS CURRENTLY WORTH $44 MILLION DOLLARS.”\n\nA list of suspicious cloud mining sites to follow\n\nKypertech advises that miners should be careful with any further dealings with cloud miners.\n\nThe hackers say about other cloud mining sites:"", 'CN, July 2, 2016 at 15:13 UTC\n\nPwC announces strategic alliance with BitSE to accelerate the use of blockchain in Asia Pacific markets.\n\n\n\nThe two firms will join forces to create a 50-strong team of specialists and provide one-stop, innovative blockchain solutions.\n\nShanghai, 16 June 2016 – PwC China signed a join business relationship with BitSE – a Shanghai-based blockchain start-up, just like they signed a strategic partnership with Blockstream. With BitSE together, the two firms plan to leverage their respective strengths to bring blockchain technology to the Asia Pacific market through one-stop solutions. Blockchain, or “distributed ledger”, technology has been used for a number of years but rose to prominence along with the explosive rise of Bitcoin in 2013. Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.\n\n“Blockchain is a disruptive technology,” said Jim Woods, PwC’s Risk & Regulatory Services Leader for Asia Pacific, at the signing ceremony. “Just as the Internet has had a revolutionary impact on culture and commerce since it first emerged for wide-scale use in the mid-1990s, Blockchain is going to be similarly transformative. It will change the way business is conducted across many industries, especially Financial Services. In the new world of digital disruption, our clients expect PwC to provide greater trust and confidence around their business model innovation. Our alliance with BitSE will ensure that we supplement PwC’s market leadership position with a deep technical capability to help our clients design and implement innovative blockchain solutions.”\n\n“Blockchain technology has a wide range of potential applications,” said BitSE CEO Qian Dejun. “More clients will focus on blockchain and start to adopt it in their industries in the near future. PwC has extensive expertise and advisory experience, which will help us to promote these new solutions in the market.”\n\nBlockchain’s distributed ledger technology enables secure transactions between two parties without the need of an intermediary, such as a bank. Some major corporations have developed internal blockchain systems to manage transfers and other payments between different business units. Blockchain is also being used to develop ‘smart contracts’….\n\nPwC China Fintech Partner William Gee said “Together, we aim to be the first professional services team to enable adoption of blockchain business solutions in Asia Pacific for financial services, governments and other industry clients.”\n\n“Although the market acceptance of blockchain and the pace of R&D has been a bit slower in China than in western countries, we believe that by teaming up with PwC we can speed up research into and the use of blockchain in the Asia Pacific market,” said BitSE CTO Shuai Chu.\n\n“PwC will bring deep industry experience, a broad range of business services and client insights,” CY Cheung, PwC China Fintech Partner, said. “Through this partnership, we can maximise our expertise, technology and talent to assist our clients to face new competition, adapt to disruptive market forces and lead to innovation.”\n\nPwC and BitSE are working closely with several local financial institutions to explore and develop plans to implement blockchain applications in near future.\n\nENDS\n\nSubscribe to our RSS feeds for updates on our press releases –http://www.pwchk.com/home/ eng/rss.html\n\nNotes to editors\n\nAbout BitSE\n\nBitSE established 2013, focusing on the blockchain field and devoting to the blockchain technology to make innovations in industries.

Around 2.2 million people are employed in financial and related services, with over 700,000 based in London, and with the financial industry contributing 12% of UK economic output in 2014, the stakes are high.\n\nGoogletown, Slack, Twitter, Airbnb: This is Dublin\n\nOut of all the competitors, Ireland seems to be in the best position to claim the finance crown, that’s if it actually comes up for the taking. With a corporation tax rate of 12.5%, the lowest in Western Europe, it is already the EU base for tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Apple.\n\nTwitter, Airbnb and Slack are other notable tech companies who have their European headquarters in Dublin, close to the city’s so-called Silicon Docks, which lies near a neighbourhood dubbed “Googletown” because of Google's vast campus there.\n\nOther unique attractions Dublin has to entice UK fintech companies to set up base across the Irish sea are a young, native English-speaking, tech-savvy population of 4.6 million people, an openness to overseas talent and a government ready to welcome them with open arms.\n\nThen there is the attractiveness for licensing intellectual property rights, with patent and copyright income subject to just 6.25 percent tax in many circumstances, and 25 percent tax credits available for research and development spending, it is no surprise that so many U.S tech companies are using Ireland as their base for licensing their technology to all their European subsidiaries.\n\nDoubts over UK’s passporting mechanism\n\nBy some rankings, London is the world’s No.1 financial sector capital, ahead of New York, Hong Kong, and Singapore and what happens to those figures now that the UK has voted to leave the EU is anyone’s guess.\n\nFinancial firms that are located in Britain can operate in the EU, via a mechanism called “passporting.” Britain will have to renegotiate these rights, and many believe it will be impossible to secure better terms than they have now.\n\nJon Terry, the head of financial services at PWC in London, said; “It’s a significant risk that we won’t get as favorable terms as we have now.”\n\nOne company whose next moves bear watching is Transferwise. With its sky-high valuation, it is a massive player in the fintech space and as “passporting” allows Transferwise to be regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, but offer remittance services across the EU without additional hurdles, it means the fintech firm can keep its staff in the UK while offering those services across Europe, without the need for physical branches elsewhere.\n\nMoney-transfer and payments start-ups would be hardest hit by the end of EU passporting, but as the jury is still out on the true impact of Brexit on the fintech industry, we will just have to wait and see if London’s finance crown goes up for the taking and if Dublin could be the European city to take its place."", 'Tag für Tag tauchen neue Cloudmining Dienste auf, die Kunden versprechen, mit dem Bitcoin Mining ohne technische Kenntnisse aus der Cloud Geld zu verdienen. BTC-ECHO erreichen viele Zuschriften und Nachfragen zu Cloudminingangeboten.\n\nWas ist Cloudmining? Benutzer können Rechenkapazitäten „mieten“ und diese dazu nutzen, digitale Währungen zu minen. Die meisten Cloudmining Anbieter bieten ein Webinterface an, wo der Kunde seine Rechenleistung kaufen kann. Dann kann er ohne eigene Hardware digitale Währungen aus der Ferne minen.\n\nWie verdiene ich Geld durch Cloudmining?\n\nEntscheidend ist, dass man für eine bestimmte Laufzeit Mining-Power mietet, die in das Bitcoin Netzwerk eingespeist wird. Man bezahlt oft einmalig und erhält dafür anschließend die gemietete Rechenkapazität für den bezahlten Zeitraum. Das bedeutet: Als Kunde spekuliert man indirekt auf mehrere Einflüsse, darunter vor allem auch der Bitcoin Kurs:\n\nSehr hohe Verdienstmöglichkeiten ergeben sich bei Cloudminern oft dann, wenn der Bitcoin Kurs einige Tage zuvor extrem angestiegen ist und man für die Zukunft mit eben diesem hohen Wert kalkuliert. Man geht also davon aus, dass man die geschürften Bitcoins zum Ende der Laufzeit immer noch zum aktuellen Preis verkaufen kann. Im Abschnitt “Wann lohnt sich ein Mining Vertrag” gehe ich speziell auf die wichtigsten Kennzahlen ein.\n\nWorauf sollte ich bei der Auswahl eines Cloudminers achten?\n\nWichtig ist, dass der Anbieter seine Geräte wirklich nachweisen kann. Einige Anbieter haben sich vehement dagegen gewehrt, einen Beweis für das Vorhandensein der Miner zu liefern. So entsteht schnell der Verdacht, dass hinter dem Mining-Business lediglich eine große Blase in Form eines Schneeballsystems steckt, die in nicht allzu weit entfernter Zeit zu platzen droht (s.u.). Selbstverständlich können auch Bilder von Miningfarmen geklaut, gekauft oder gefälscht werden. Einen Anbieter, der seine Farmen aber überhaupt nicht nachgewiesen hat, sollte man daher mit Skepsis betrachten.\n\nEin weiterer Indikator für die Verlässlichkeit und Seriösität eines Anbieters sind oft die geleisteten Versprechen. Schwarze Schaafe versprechen oft horrende Beträge, die Opfer in die Falle locken und durch Träume von der finanziellen Freiheit schnell in den Ruin treiben. Du solltest mit gesundem Menschenverstand prüfen, ob es wirklich realistisch ist.\n\nGute Erfahrungen haben wir bisher mit dem Cloud-Mining Anbieter Genesis Mining* gemacht. TIPP: Mit Eingabe des Promo-Codes vS2DmY erhaltet ihr einen Rabatt von 3%\n\nPreisanalyse: Wann lohnt sich ein Mining Vertrag?\n\nOb sich ein Mining Vertrag lohnt, lässt sich über bestimmte Kennzahlen errechnen. Du solltest dir dennoch im Klaren darüber sein, dass die Kennzahlen sich jederzeit (insbesondere bei langen Verträgen) ändern können. Daher sollte auch die “Änderungswahrscheinlichkeit” mit als Kennzahl einbezogen werden.\n\nGanz allgemein gesagt ergibt sich der Gewinn durch folgende Formel:\n\nGewinn = (Geschürfte Bitcoin Menge x Bitcoin Preis) – Fixkosten für den Miningvertrag – laufende Kosten\n\nDie Formel sieht zunächst einfach aus, dahinter verbergen sich allerdings viele Unsicherheiten:\n\nBitcoin Kurs\n\nDie Mining Auszahlungen finden normalerweise regelmäßig statt. Um also den geplanten Profit zu erwirtschaften, muss der Bitcoin Kurs zumindest zum Ende der Laufzeit den erwarteten Kurs erreichen. Dann könnte man all die angesammelten Bitcoins verkaufen und den kalkulierten Erlös erzielen.\n\nLaufzeit\n\nJe länger die Laufzeit, desto höher das Risiko. Wer einen dreijährigen Vertrag abschließt, weiß erstens so gut wie garnicht, auf welchem Niveau sich der Bitcoin Kurs zum Ende der Laufzeit bewegt und ebenfalls nicht, wie sich die insgesamte Hashpower im Netzwerk entwickelt. Damit sind wir auch schon bei der Difficulty:\n\nMining Difficulty (Schiwerigkeit)\n\nDie Difficulty (Schwierigkeit der Mining-Berechnungen) wird gewissermaßen durch die Rechenkapazität bestimmt, die von allen Minern zusammen in das Bitcoin Netzwerk eingespeist wird. Auf lange Sicht rechnet man stets mit einem Anstieg der Difficulty, weil die Technik stets weiterentwickelt wird und so größere Rechenleistungen möglich sind. Wer einen Cloudmining Vertrag abschließt, erwirbt hingegen meist das Recht, eine bestimmte Rechenpower zu beanspruchen. Diese ist aber sehr inflationär geprägt und bringt mit der Zeit normalerweise einen geringer werdenden Gewinn. So lässt sich wieder die Brücke zum Risiko der Laufzeit schlagen.\n\nBlockreward\n\nWenn du selbst aktiv mitschürfen möchtest, interessiert dich vor allem der Blockreward, also die Anzahl an Bitcoins, die pro gefundenem Block ausgeschüttet werden. Die Ausschüttung wird dabei in unregelmäßigen Abständen (abhängig von der Mining-Leistung) halbiert. Nach dem Block Halving im (voraus.) Juli 2016 wird pro Block nur noch eine Summe von 12,5 Bitcoins ausgeschüttet. Wann das Blockhalving stattfindet, kann nie vorausgesagt, sondern immer nur geschätzt werden. Je eher das Blockhalving aber bevorsteht, können Websites wie diese den Halving Zeitpunkt aber sehr genau abschätzen.\n\nVersteckte Kosten (Gebühren, Strom)\n\nViele Cloudmining Anbieter verlangen neben der einmaligen Zahlung für die Vertragslaufzeit auch laufende Gebühren wie bspw. Stromkosten, um die Betriebskosten zu decken. Man sollte also aufpassen, dass die laufenden Kosten den Gewinn ab einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt nicht übersteigen. Manche Anbieter haben ihre Dienste in Krisenzeiten, in denen der Kurs kurz vorher extrem gefallen war, sogar heruntergefahren, weil die laufenden Kosten nicht durch den erwirtschafteten Gewinn hätten gedeckt werden können. In der Regel ziehen die Anbieter maximal so viel Stromkosten ab, wie Gewinne erwirtschaftet wurden, sodass Kunden nicht zusätzlich draufzahlen müssen. Sinkt der Kurs also sehr stark, sind die laufenden Kosten sogar so hoch, dass der Mining-Anbieter die übrigen Stromkosten selbst zahlen muss. Dann pausiert er den Betrieb zeitweise, bis sich die Lage beruhigt hat.\n\nWährend die Stromkosten gewissermaßen in der Natur der Sache liegen und aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen der Betrieb kurzzeitig heruntergefahren werden kann, sollte man sich vor Auszahlungsgebühren in Acht nehmen: Da Bitcoin Transaktionen keine nennenswerten Gebühren tragen, sind Auszahlungsgebühren nur selten rechtzufertigen und oft eine versteckte Kostenfalle.\n\nWirtschaftlichkeitsanalyse in der Praxis\n\nDie oben beschriebenen Theorien sind sehr umfangreich. Wie du sicher gemerkt hast, lassen sich auch nicht alle Faktoren quantifizieren, um wirklich “ausrechnen” zu können, ob sich ein bestimmter Cloudmining Vertrag lohnt. Einige der Kennzahlen kann man dennoch so verdichten, dass sich der erwartete Gewinn in etwa abschätzen lässt.\n\nWir empfehlen folgendes Tool zur Berechnung:\n\nhttp://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/\n\nDas Tool berechnet, wie viel Geld sich mit einer bestimmten Rechenleistung verdienen lässt. Entscheidend ist dabei, dass das Tool dabei nicht nur den heutigen Kurs und die heutige Difficulty mit in die Berechnung einbezieht, sondern man diese Werte frei wählen kann. Normalerweise gibt man hier bspw. den Anschaffungspreis des Mining Geräts an, bei Cloudmining Verträgen bietet es sich an, hierfür die Vertragskosten einzukalkulieren.\n\nSelbstverständlich ist auch hier etwas Fingerspitzengefühl gefragt: Eine “richtige” Schätzung gibt es logischerweise nicht. Man sollte daher möglichst viele Szenarien durchspielen und schauen, unter welchen Annahmen sich welcher Gewinn ergibt. Rechnet man mit einem starken Anstieg der Difficulty oder einem konstant verlaufenden Bitcoin Preis? Muss man Stromgebühren beim Cloudminer entrichten? Wie stark nimmt der Mining Verdienst durch Anstieg der Difficulty pro Jahr ab?\n\nDer Wert “Hardware Break Even” gibt an, nach welchem Zeitraum man unter Annahme der eingegebenen Werte seine Investition wieder durch Gewinne amortisiert hätte. Der Wert sollte logischerweise über der Laufzeit des Mining Vertrags liegen.\n\nEin böses Schneeballsystem?\n\nEinigen Anbietern wird vorgeworfen, in Wirklichkeit keine Rechenpower zur Verfügung zu stellen, sondern eigentlich nur ein verdecktes Schneeballsystem zu betreiben: Das bedeutet: Tatsächlich besäße der Betreiber gar keine Geräte, die die Rechenleistung in das Bitcoin Netzwerk einspeisen, sondern deckt die Auszahlungen von bestehenden Kunden ausschließlich über die Einzahlungen von neuen Kunden. Dieses sogenannte ponzi scheme funktioniert nur so lange, wie eine immer größere Anzahl an neuen Kunden hinzukommt und die Auszahlungen der bestehenden Kunden decken kann. Schließlich möchten diese bestehenden Kunden mehr Auszahlungen erhalten, als sie zuvor Einzahlungen geleistet haben. Das exponentielle Wachstum führt auf lange Sicht irgendwann in den Abgrund, sollte der Anbieter an seinem Schneeballsystem festhalten. Dann können die versprochenen Auszahlungen nicht mehr durch neue Einzahlungen gedeckt werden.\n\nCloudminer begünstigen oft auch eine Zentralisierung der Hashpower im Netzwerk, weil sie ähnlich wie Mining-Pools aufgebaut sind. 2013 kam es so weit, dass ein Mining-Pool die 50% Grenze der Hashpower im gesamten Netzwerk überschritten hatte.\n\nInteresse am Mining?\n\nIn der Bitcoin Bibel findest du weitere Informationen dazu, wie das Mining funktioniert und das Bitcoin Netzwerk sich auf die “Schürfer” stützt. Seit kurzem auch als Taschenbuch auf Amazon erhältlich.\n\nHinweis: Sämtliche Informationen beruhen auf der subjektiven Einschätzung des Autors und sind keinesfalls als Anlage-/Investitionsberatung zu verstehen. Derartige Investments sind immer risikobehaftet und können bis zum Totalverlust führen.\n\n\n\nHast Du bereits Erfahrungen mit Cloudminern gemacht?

07/03/2016,"['A delegation of American executives flew to Beijing in April for a secret meeting just blocks from Tiananmen Square. They had come to court the new kingmakers in one of the strangest experiments in money the world has seen: the virtual currency known as bitcoin.\n\nAgainst long odds, and despite an abstruse structure, in which supercomputers “mine” the currency via mathematical formulas, bitcoin has become a multibillion-dollar industry. It has attracted major investments from Silicon Valley and a significant following on Wall Street.\n\nYet bitcoin, which is both a new kind of digital money and an unusual financial network, is having something of an identity crisis. Like so many technologies before it, the virtual currency is coming up against the inevitable push and pull between commercial growth and the purity of its original ambitions.\n\nIn its early conception, bitcoin was to exist beyond the control of any single government or country. It would be based everywhere and nowhere.\n\nYet despite the talk of a borderless currency, a handful of Chinese companies have effectively assumed majority control of the bitcoin network. They have done so through canny investments and vast farms of computer servers dispersed around the country. The US delegation flew to Beijing because that was where much of the bitcoin power was concentrated.\n\nAt the time of the meeting, held at the Grand Hyatt hotel, more than 70% of the transactions on the bitcoin network were going through just four Chinese companies, known as bitcoin mining pools—and most flowed through just two of those companies. That gives them what amounts to veto power over any changes to the bitcoin software and technology.\n\nChina has become a market for bitcoin unlike anything in the West, fueling huge investments in server farms as well as enormous speculative trading on Chinese bitcoin exchanges. Chinese exchanges have accounted for 42% of all bitcoin transactions this year, according to an analysis performed for The New York Times by Chainalysis. Just last week, the Chinese Internet giant Baidu joined with three Chinese banks to invest in the US bitcoin company Circle.\n\nBut China’s clout is raising worries about bitcoin’s independence and decentralisation, which was supposed to give the technology freedom from the sort of government crackdowns and interventions that are commonplace in the Chinese financial world.\n\n“The concentration in a single jurisdiction does not bode well,” said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell University and a bitcoin researcher. “We need to pay attention to these things if we want decentralization to be a meaningful thing.”\n\nThe power of Chinese companies has already come to play a major role in a civil war that has divided bitcoin followers over the last year and led to the departure of one of the top developers of the virtual currency. The dispute has hinged on technical matters as well as on bigger questions of what bitcoin should look like in 10 or 20 years.\n\nAlso Read: Understanding bitcoins and blockchain\n\nNetwork bottleneck\n\nThe US companies whose executives journeyed to the Grand Hyatt—including venture-capital-funded startups like Coinbase and Circle—are fighting to make bitcoin bigger. They hope to expand the capacity of the bitcoin network so that it can process more transactions and compete with the PayPals and Visas of the world.\n\nThe current size of the network goes back to the early days, when bitcoin’s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, limited the amount of data that could travel through the network, essentially capping it at about seven transactions a second. As bitcoin has grown more popular, those limits have caused severe congestion and led to lengthy transaction delays.\n\nThe US delegation in China had a software proposal, known as bitcoin Classic, that would change all that.\n\nThe Chinese companies, though, had the ultimate decision-making power over any changes in the software, and they did not agree with the American delegation. The Chinese had thrown in their lot with another group of long-time programmers who wanted to keep bitcoin smaller, in part to keep it more secure. The Americans hoped to persuade the Chinese to switch sides.\n\nIn a hotel conference room, the US team of about a half-dozen people cycled through its PowerPoint slides, in English and Chinese, arguing for expansion of the network, most notably pointing to the long delays that have been plaguing the system as a result of the congestion. The Chinese representatives listened and conferred among themselves. The group took a break for a lunch of lamb and dumplings at a nearby mall.\n\nRacks of Bitcoin mining machines line the shelves at a server farm in Guizhou, China. Photo: Gilles Sabrie/The New York Times\n\n“We kept coming back and saying, ‘For better or worse, you have this leadership in the industry, and everyone is looking to you to show some leadership,’” said Brian Armstrong, chief executive of Coinbase.\n\nUltimately, Armstrong said, “We were unable to convince them.”\n\nSome bitcoin advocates have complained that the Chinese companies have been motivated only by short-term profit, rather than the long-term success and ideals of the project. Bobby Lee, chief executive of the bitcoin company BTCC, which is based in Shanghai, bristled at that—and at the notion that the Chinese companies represent any sort of united front. He attended the April meeting and pointed out that the Chinese companies had disagreed among themselves on how urgent it was to make changes to the bitcoin software.\n\nHe said the American companies failed to understand the power dynamics in the room that day. “It was almost like imperialistic Westerners coming to China and telling us what to do,” Lee said in an interview last week. “There has been a history on this. The Chinese people have long memories.”\n\nA mining powerhouse\n\nThe mysterious creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, released the software in early 2009. It was designed to provide both a digital coin and a new way to move and hold money, much as email had made it possible to send messages without using a postal service.\n\nFrom the beginning, the system was designed to be decentralised—operated by all the people who joined their computers to the bitcoin network and helped process the transactions, much as Wikipedia entries are written and maintained by volunteers around the world.\n\nThe appeal of a group-run network was that there would be no single point of failure and no company that could shut things down if the police intervened. This was censorship-free money, bitcoin followers liked to say. Decision-making power for the network resided with the people who joined it, in proportion to the computing power they provided.\n\nThe allure of new riches provided the incentive to join: Every 10 minutes, new bitcoins would be released and given to one of the computers helping maintain the system. In the lingo of bitcoin, these computers were said to be mining for currency. They also served as accountants for the network.\n\nFor the first few years, aside from its use as a payment method on the Silk Road, an online drug market that has since been shut down, bitcoin failed to gain much traction. It burst into the world’s consciousness in 2013 when the price of the digital money began to spike, in no small part because Chinese investors began trading bitcoins in large numbers.\n\nLee said the Chinese took quickly to bitcoin for several reasons. For one thing, the Chinese government had strictly limited other potential investment avenues, giving citizens a hunger for new assets. Also, Lee said, the Chinese loved the volatile price of bitcoin, which gave the fledgling currency network the feeling of online gambling, a very popular activity in China.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin’s troubles\n\nThere has been widespread speculation that Chinese people have used bitcoin to get money out of the country and evade capital controls, but Lee and other experts said the evidence suggests this is not a significant phenomenon.\n\n“No Chinese person is pushing for bitcoin because it’s libertarian or because it’s going to cause the downfall of governments,” said Lee, who moved to China after growing up in Africa and the US and studying at Stanford University. “This was an investment.”\n\nThe extent of the speculative activity in China in late 2013 pushed the price of a single bitcoin above $1,000. That surge—and the accompanying media spotlight—led China’s government to intervene in December 2013 and cut off the flow of money between Chinese banks and bitcoin exchanges, popping what appeared to be a bitcoin bubble.\n\nThe frenzy, though, awakened interest in another aspect of the currency: bitcoin mining.\n\nPeter Ng, a former investment manager, is one of the many people in China who moved from trading bitcoins to amassing computing power to mine them. First, he mined for himself. More recently he has created data centers across China where other people can pay to set up their own mining computers. He now has 28 such centers, all of them filled with endless racks of servers, tangled cords and fans cooling the machines.\n\nNg, 36, said he had become an expert in finding cheap energy, often in places where a coal plant or hydroelectric dam was built to support some industrial project that never happened. The bitcoin mining machines in his facilities use about 38 megawatts of electricity, he said, enough to power a small city.\n\nThe people who put their machines in Ng’s data centers generally join mining pools, which smooth the financial returns of smaller players. A popular one, BTCC Pool, is run by Lee’s company. This month it attracted about 13% of the total computational power on the bitcoin network. The most powerful pool in China—or anywhere in the world—is known as F2Pool, and it had 27% of the network’s computational power last month.\n\nAn electric switch powering one of the virtual currency mining farms is threaded through an open window in Guizhou, China. Photo: Gilles Sabrie/The New York Times\n\nThe politics of pools\n\nBig pool operators have become the kingmakers of the bitcoin world: Running the pools confers the right to vote on changes to bitcoin’s software, and the bigger the pool, the more voting power. If members of a pool disagree, they can switch to another pool. But most miners choose a pool based on its payout structure, not its bitcoin politics.\n\nIt was his role overseeing BTCC Pool that got Lee invited to the meeting with the American delegation in Beijing. The head of operations at F2Pool, Wang Chun, was also there.\n\nPerhaps the most important player in the Chinese bitcoin world is Jihan Wu, 30, a former investment analyst who founded what is often described in China as the world’s most valuable bitcoin company. That company, Bitmain, began to build computers in 2013 using chips specially designed to do mining computations.\n\nBitmain, which has 250 employees, manufactures and sells bitcoin mining computers. It also operates a pool that other miners can join, called Antpool, and keeps a significant number of mining machines for itself, which it maintains in Iceland and the US, as well as in China. The machines that Bitmain retains for itself account for 10% of the computing power on the global bitcoin network and are enough to produce new coins worth about $230,000 each day, at the exchange rate last week.\n\nWu and the other mining pool operators in China have often seemed somewhat surprised, and even unhappy, that their investments have given them decision-making power within the bitcoin network. “Miners are the hardware guys. Why are you asking us about software?” is the line that Ng said he often hears from miners.\n\nThis attitude initially led most Chinese miners to align themselves with old-line bitcoin coders, known as the core programmers, who have resisted changing the software. The miners wanted to take no risks with the money they were minting.\n\nBut lately, Wu has grown increasingly vocal in his belief that the network is going to have to expand, and soon, if it wants to keep its followers. He said in an email last week that if the core programmers did not increase the number of transactions going through the network by July, he would begin looking for alternatives to expand the network.\n\nHowever the software debate goes, there are fears that China’s government could decide, at some point, to pressure miners in the country to use their influence to alter the rules of the bitcoin network. The government’s intervention in 2013 suggests that bitcoin is not too small to escape notice.\n\nWu dismissed that concern. He also said that as more Americans buy his Bitmain machines and take advantage of cheap power in places like Washington state, mining will naturally become more decentralized. Already, he said, 30 to 40% of new Bitmain machines are being shipped out of China.\n\nFor now, though, China remains dominant.\n\n“The Chinese government normally expects its businesses to obtain a leading role in emerging industries,” he said. “China’s bitcoin businesses have achieved that.”\n\n©2016/The New York Times', 'Newly unsealed court documents have revealed that one of the corrupt federal agents investigating Silk Road, the online drug marketplace, is suspected of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin—after he pleaded guilty last year.\n\nShaun Bridges is one of two agents who pled guilty to stealing from the Darknet market. Bridges stole about $800,000 worth of bitcoins from Silk Road drug dealers after he and a partner arrested a Silk Road admin and learned how to reset passwords. That led to Ross Ulbricht, who was convicted of running Silk Road in February 2015, attempting to order the murder of the admin, Curtis Green. Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison last year.\n\nBridges\' scam was later discovered, though. The former Secret Service agent, who served on a Baltimore-based task force investigating Silk Road, was arrested in March 2015 and pled guilty a few months later. In January, Bridges was arrested again just one day before he was scheduled to turn himself in. The documents unsealed Thursday shed light on why the second arrest took place.\n\nAccess not denied\n\nIn November 2014, the US Attorney in Maryland seized 1606 bitcoins, worth about $600,000 (£400,000) at the time, from various accounts at a company called Bitstamp. Bridges was the affiant on the warrant, and the funds were put into a Bitcoin wallet he created. Later, some of the account owners ""disputed the legality of the warrant,"" according to an affidavit (PDF) signed by by IRS Special Agent Tigran Gambaryan, who headed up the Northern California-based investigation of Bridges\' crimes. In September 2015, a federal court in Maryland ordered the US Secret Service to return $30,616 worth of bitcoins to the affected Bitstamp clients.\n\nWhen the Secret Service accessed the wallet, however, the the bitcoins were gone. They\'d been moved on July 28, after Bridges signed his guilty plea.\n\nThe affidavit doesn\'t outright state that Bridges took the money, but it looks mighty suspicious. It\'s possible that other employees had access, but ""at present the only individual that is conclusively known to have access was Bridges."" Secret Service had never revoked Bridges\' access to the wallet, even after he had been arrested and the agents were warned to do so. About a dozen other Secret Service employees were interviewed and all reported they did not have access to the wallet.\n\nThe stolen money was moved into an account at BTC-e associated with the e-mail account ""branstein.gustaf@outlook.com."" BTC-e is an unregistered foreign Bitcoin exchange that ""operates without appropriate anti-money laundering"" policies, according to the government. BTC-e ultimately did provide some records, but the logs showed that the money was accessed through Tor and run through a Bitcoin tumbler. When he was a federal agent, Bridges was a specialist in tumbler and the user of Tor.\n\nThe affidavit also recounts how Bridges petitioned a Maryland state court to change his name from ""Shaun Wesley Bridges"" to ""Calogero Esposito."" (Bridges\' wife\'s last name is Esposito). Bridges, who sought to have the name change sealed from the public record, neglected to mention that he had been arrested and was scheduled to plead guilty to money-laundering charges. His petition for a name change was denied, but he re-petitioned two more times.\n\nBridges\' PayPal account also showed that he had attempted to order a birth certificate from a company that claims to provide German documents.\n\nThe affidavit also asks for a warrant to obtain records from Microsoft related to the ""branstein.gustaf@outlook.com"" address, saying there\'s probable cause the account was related to the theft.\n\nWhile the documents lay out what the government was thinking in late January, there\'s no indication of where the investigation proceeded after that. Bridges has begun serving his original sentence at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. It isn\'t clear if or when additional charges will be filed against him.', 'Ariel Deschapell is currently content manager for Ubitquity, a blockchain real estate startup, and recently held the Henry Hazlitt Fellowship at the Foundation for Economic Education.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Deschapell argues the current cap on bitcoin transactions isn\'t likely to hurt the technology\'s long-term adoption, and that more creative solutions should be prioritized.\n\nBitcoin finds itself at an interesting, perhaps even pivotal, moment.\n\nIn the wake of the UK\'s EU referendum, or \'Brexit\', many financial news outlets have taken to recognizing bitcoin’s increasingly credible role as a safe haven asset. Institutional investors like Daniel Masters are starting to signal it could be ready for primetime, and the market cap is hovering around $10bn after a recent string of gains.\n\nBut as its price and investment outlook continue to improve, a question hangs over the decentralized network behind the digital currency: Can it scale to meet adoption pressures?\n\nOn its current development trajectory, some don’t think so.\n\nThe technology behind bitcoin is called the blockchain. Blocks containing all recent transactions on the bitcoin network are confirmed about every 10 minutes, and are currently capped at 1MB of information a block.\n\nThe problem? Average block sizes are trending closer to this limit and some are already hitting it, pushing excess transactions to the following block. Consequently, there are periods of delayed confirmation times and higher transaction fees that have many in the space feeling anxious.\n\nAs a result, the question of how to scale bitcoin is currently the most divisive in the space.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin Core developers have a plan in place, a vocal minority believes more immediate action is required. The coming months will cement which approach is taken, so it\'s important to explore if that more immediate action is needed for bitcoin’s continued success.\n\nHow should bitcoin scale?\n\nThe dream of bitcoin evangelists is for the currency to one day end the global patchwork of sovereign fiat currencies and be the principal means to carry out all transactions.\n\nThese are lofty goals, and to even have a chance at attaining them, bitcoin needs to first solve its very real technical limitations. While bitcoin is a sound, inelastic currency, the truth is that the attached payment network cannot currently support even a fraction of a fraction of today’s global transactions.\n\nTake just the Visa network for instance, which hit 47,000 peak transactions per second on its network during the 2013 holidays.\n\nIn comparison to this single centralized payment processor, the bitcoin protocol can only handle a handful of transactions per second. Clearly, to reach its ambitious goals, bitcoin needs to improve its transaction throughput by an order of magnitude. The easiest way to increase this number is by raising the current 1MB cap on the block size. It’s also the worst way of doing it.\n\nAs developers Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja wrote in their white paper on bitcoin payment channels:\n\n""If we use an average of 300 bytes per bitcoin transaction and assumed unlimited block sizes, an equivalent capacity to peak Visa transaction volume of 47,000/tps would be nearly 8 GB per bitcoin block, every 10 minutes on average. Continuously, that would be over 400 terabytes of data per year.""\n\nThese dramatic numbers tell us that increasing the block size alone is a non-starter as a long-term plan for scaling bitcoin.\n\nAny increase creates greater centralization pressure on the backbone of the network: miners and nodes. Without a robustly distributed network, bitcoin is more vulnerable to censorship and attack. To put it differently, to increase the block size is to make a conscious tradeoff between decentralization and performance.\n\nYet bitcoin’s decentralization is its single greatest feature, as it underpins its immutability and resistance to censorship. Without these features, bitcoin is reduced to simply being a very cumbersome and expensive PayPal. So, if bitcoin can instead be scaled without sacrificing any degree of decentralization, then this is clearly the path that should be taken.\n\nThis is why we need long-term scaling solutions that tackle the heart of the problem.\n\nThe network as it stands cannot scale effectively. Therefore, the way the network itself works needs to be optimized and built upon. The optimization comes from upgrades like Segregated Witness, which streamlines the way blocks process transactions and increases efficiency without increasing block size.\n\nSegWit also sets the foundation for future upgrades which will add on to bitcoin proper and dramatically increase its transaction throughput.\n\nThese are concepts such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, which can be read about in more detail elsewhere.\n\nIsn\'t a 1MB cap hurting adoption?\n\nEven with Segregated Witness undergoing testing, and various top-level protocol implementations in development, some urgently insist the problem is blocks are getting full now.\n\nThe argument generally goes like this: As blocks near capacity transaction times get slow and fees get higher. These issues mean less adoption, and less adoption means a faltering network effect and dying bitcoin. Thus, we need a hardfork to increase the block size to at least 2MB for an immediate capacity increase while longer-term solutions are developed.\n\nBut increasing the block size even marginally still carries with it security risks, and remains a cumbersome way to scale bitcoin period.\n\nIn this light, the only reason to push for a hardfork is if it can be shown that fuller 1MB blocks actually and significantly hinder short- to medium-term adoption. They don’t.\n\nFuller average blocks mean higher fees, and if those fees are not met, then yes, there will be slower confirmation times on the network.\n\nFrom a Bitcoin evangelist point of view, it’s easy to see how this could hurt adoption. A consumer using bitcoin for the first time and running into a severe confirmation delay for a retail transaction might very well get turned off from the overhyped technology that doesn’t work exactly as advertised.\n\nAnd it’s these types of smaller transactions which fuller blocks disproportionately impact. The problem is that this scenario is still largely a dream.\n\nBitcoin is years away from being easy enough for the average consumer to acquire on their phone to use it as a serious alternative to something like Apple Pay or even Venmo. The truth is bitcoin today is already absolutely terrible for those use cases. That simply isn’t where current growth is coming from. The reason is simple but powerful: volatility.\n\nFor day-to-day living and expenses, no average consumer in their right mind is going to put up with a wildly fluctuating currency when a far more stable and accepted one is readily at hand.\n\nAs the mainstream media is realizing, the lion’s share of bitcoin’s current growth is undoubtedly as an investment and speculation vehicle. These type of transactions tend to be much larger in value than retail ones.\n\nThis is correlated by numbers available at Tradeblock, which can show us that the average bitcoin transaction between 27th May and 25th June was around 12 and 14 BTC, much larger than any conceivable retail purchase.\n\nHere, bitcoin doesn’t need to beat instant credit card transactions and stable purchasing power. It just needs to beat traditional bank transfers and wires (which at three to five business days with high fees will remain an absurdly easy task), and comparable asset performance elsewhere.\n\nAs bitcoin becomes a more proven and sought after investment commodity, its market cap will grow. Volatility should decrease as a result, making it gradually more suitable for the use cases of the average consumer.\n\nThis is when reliable, fast, and cheap micro-transactions become far more important to growth. But this won’t happen within the next few months. It won’t even be happening by the time a Lightning Network implementation has been successfully deployed, and probably not for awhile after that.\n\nThat’s because ending the patchwork of fiat currencies is a very long process. True Bitcoin evangelists are in it for the long haul.\n\nThe evangelists who believe fuller blocks will hurt or even kill bitcoin adoption in the short-term cannot see the forest for the trees. They want to see the bitcoin currency adopted by the masses, and make an error in believing that its first phase of growth pivots on that mass adoption.\n\nIn truth, even without network throughput being an issue, we are still so far away from that. The masses won’t drive bitcoin’s growth, yet. Investors and speculators will continue to do that heavy lifting, and the system will continue to work great for them even if blocks are temporarily fuller.\n\nBlock size increases will eventually come, but they’re a very small part of the scaling equation. Hardforking now won’t give us anything except the illusion of progress and added problems for Bitcoin Core developers to address.\n\nBlockchain scalability is not an easy fix. It is only with slow, steady, and creative problem solving and development that it will be addressed.\n\nWhile that foundation is being laid, there’s little reason and no evidence that adoption will be immediately hindered by a continued 1MB block size.\n\nWooden blocks image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

In general, retail businesses keep track of their monthly transactions, and then remit sales taxes due at the end of the month. Using a form of smart contract, perhaps via a Bitcoin payment gateway, sales taxes could be remitted to governments in real time. This provides a direct benefit to government over cash, which is often a massive grey area for off-balance sheet transactions where tax is rarely collected.”\n\nIt all boils down to proper regulation\n\nAnother expert who spoke to CoinTelegraph on the issue is Dmitry Lazarichev, Founder at Wirex.\n\nLazarichev says that Bitcoin being a conceptually new type of money has significantly changed our mindset. He explains that there has been a solid taxation system, especially in developed countries, where bank statements, income, expenses and exchange rates act as fundamentals for taxation regimes.\n\nHe tells CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Obviously some people, so called the underbanked population, are not happy with such control from the tax authorities and prefer operating via impersonal cash. Would Bitcoin serve this Underbanked population well? Probably yes. However, there are not many benefits for them in it, because Bitcoin is much more traceable than banknotes.”\n\nLazarichev maintains that overall, while the tax authorities are figuring out how to identify the beneficiaries of the Bitcoin transactions to apply certain taxes, Bitcoin might attract some people who are very interested in decreasing their tax payments. But once the proper regulation is in place, there is not much left for the tax optimization.\n\nCurrent mechanisms cannot fight tax evasion\n\nCvijovic Nikola, CTO at EC District, retains an opinion which prevails upon the current developments surrounding Bitcoin. Nikola says that at the moment traditional mechanisms used to fight tax evasion are not capable of addressing Bitcoin-based tax evasion because they are outdated.\n\nHe explains:\n\n“Bitcoin has no jurisdiction - it operates in an online world, it is anonymous and uses no intermediaries. These are three key points for determining tax liability. Of course, you can regulate Bitcoin exchanges and trading companies, but as Bitcoin becomes widely accepted, people will be able to live entirely on Bitcoin which will, to a great extent, eliminate the need for exchanges, thus making taxation even harder.”\n\nNikola concludes by saying that Bitcoin is gradually eliminating the concept of taxation, probably heading to a concept of taxation on a voluntary basis.', 'Amid increasing hype about blockchains and distributed ledgers, the value of global cryptocurrency markets has risen rapidly so far in 2016.\n\nAs of mid-June, the value of all blockchain-based currencies in circulation was $14.37bn, and the price of bitcoin was, as it has been historically, a leading driver of this growth. At June\'s highs of $700, the price of bitcoin had risen almost $300 since the end of May.\n\nAs the value of bitcoin continues to surge, many have looked at bitcoin’s market capitalization as an indication of bitcoin\'s value. With a total value of all bitcoins in existence at $10bn, the bitcoin market is currently more valuable than one of the largest social media companies in the world, Twitter.\n\nSome have argued, however, that it\'s unclear exactly where exactly the bitcoin market cap stands now, asserting it\'s impossible to determine with any sense of accuracy the value of all usable or spendable bitcoins.\n\nDue to factors – including the notion of ""zombie"" bitcoins and the number of bitcoins stored by long-term, buy-and-hold investors – these market observers believe it\'s difficult to make summary statements about the vitality of the market or its current trajectory.\n\nWhile this may be a minor thing, this difficulty in profiling the size and character of the bitcoin market is telling of the challenges the digital currency has in defining itself to the broader public. In addition, it points to pitfalls bitcoin will likely have to clear in its near-future.\n\nMore importantly, the discussion of how to capitalize a finite, virtual currency speaks to the debate of what the future of digital commerce may look like.\n\nDefining capitalization\n\nTo understand the significance of a capitalization to a market, one must understand what a market capitalization is and how it is calculated.\n\nMarket capitalization is defined traditionally as the price per share for the commodity at the time of the capitalization, multiplied by the current number of outstanding shares in the market. For most publicly-traded companies and securities, the capitalization is an simple way to ascertain the health of the market in comparison to where it was previously and comparative to other securities being traded.\n\nThe problem with the bitcoin market, however, lies in the definition of ""outstanding shares.""\n\nMost analysts use the traditional definition of ""number of tradeable units that were active in the last two weeks"" to determine market cap. While this is a perfectly acceptable for most securities, this definition has two unavoidable holes when it comes to bitcoins.\n\nFirst, if bitcoins are a digital currency, the outstanding shares definition fails to adequately account for dormant coins.\n\nIn 2014, NVIDIA engineer John Ratcliff theorized that approximately 30% of the current bitcoin supply is made up of ""zombie bitcoins"" that have been inactive for more than a year. This number includes bitcoins connected to inaccessible wallets, government-seized bitcoins, “burned” bitcoins and bitcoins abandoned during the early days of bitcoins – including Nakamoto’s mythical stash of over a million bitcoins.\n\nDue to bitcoin’s security and lack of centralized authority, any attempt to access these lost coins – short of brute-forcing their wallets\' passwords – is impossible. As such, these coins exist, but they are effectively unusable by anyone except those in possession of the related private keys.\n\nThese bitcoins, combined with those that are intentionally dormant – as either commercial reserves or as personal savings – account for coins that were used in good faith, but are currently not ""active"" in the market.\n\nToday, intentionally or unintentionally dormant coins are not reflected in most calculations of the bitcoin market cap.\n\nSecond, if bitcoins are a commodity, then the bitcoin market capitalization – as it is calculated today – is a reflection of trade volume of newly mined and short-term traded coins, and not long-term investments. As previously argued, this would exclude intentional dormancy, making the bitcoin market cap a reflection of the current fluidity of the market and not its overall worth.\n\nStill, Stephen Holmes, CTO of the Digital Banking Lab at IT consulting firm VirtusaPolaris, argues that using the market capitalization to estimate the bitcoin market’s worth is missing the point.\n\n“Bitcoin is a store of wealth. The advantage is that it is a finite currency so it cannot be deflated because of the printing of additional bitcoins, unlike today’s flat currency,"" said Holmes, adding:\n\n""Scarcity is the real value of bitcoin… exchange rates will by definition fluctuate over time.”\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nOne of the characteristics that directly affects the value and capitalization of cryptocurrencies is that they are scarce, meaning that they are goods that exist in a finite quality.\n\nIf one was to say that a cryptocurrency is a commodity in the traditional sense, one would expect to be able to trace a cryptocurrency\'s units to an actual physical entity that would confirm the unit’s uniqueness and ownership. What prevents this from happening is the blockchain, an openly shared register that stores and verifies the transactions of every cryptocurrency unit. The blockchain makes the notion of simply copying a bitcoin meaningless.\n\nThis reinforces the notion of an electronically-assured digital good, but it also creates a situation that may not be friendly to newcomers.\n\nFor example, a novice user who has lost their wallet’s password or a casual user who has had their laptop stolen will also lose access to his or her bitcoins. Though there are storage solutions available, this feeds fears that investors who buy into the market could lose custody of funds, something they may not have with more traditional assets.\n\n""It\'s a double-edged sword,"" said Chris McAlary, chief executive officer of Coin Cloud, a bitcoin trading and ATM company.\n\nHe continued:\n\n""People are drawn to bitcoin because it empowers them to take on the advantages that come with existing outside of the traditional banking system. With that come some risks which novice users may not be ready for. Successful bitcoin companies will build products that minimize that risk.""\n\nZombies and the future\n\nThe question of “zombie” bitcoins is also important because of what it represents about this emerging technology. It is theoretically possible for digital goods, such as downloadable videos, music and games, to be digitally protected using a blockchain.\n\nSuch a scheme could make media ripping and non-authorized sharing – such as peer-to-peer downloading – pointless.\n\nThis, however, opens up the possibility that assets are lost. If a product is expected to be sold digitally, many would agree that there must be a mechanism in place to facilitate recovery – something a blockchain in its present form cannot do.\n\n""With any asset there is a risk of losing it. Bitcoin is no different,"" said Holmes, adding:\n\n""The only real difference is that with bitcoin you have to carefully secure the bitcoins and that means putting them in a wallet and best practice is to hold them offline. Key management has been an ongoing challenge in the IT industry so it could be argued that this is one of the potential weaknesses of any cryptocurrency.""\n\nIn considering the true value of the bitcoin market, one must take seriously the question of lost wealth and the validity of the efforts to recover it. Due to the fact that the market has not embraced wealth recovery as a requirement, it may ultimately be impossible to truly quantify the size of the market.\n\nTo some bitcoin enthusiasts, this is a perfectly acceptable situation.\n\n""A few years ago, I lost my key to my home safe,"" Holmes said. ""After carrying the heavy safe to a number of locksmiths and getting nowhere I finally visited one and literally within two minutes he had opened the safe. Locksmiths and wallet crackers are actually a healthy development, providing that the cracking is done with consent.""\n\nHe added that these concerns, as with bitcoin\'s market cap question, are simply issues that will be solved over time, concluding:\n\n""As it did at the beginning of the dot-com boom, the market will provide what it needs to survive.""\n\nMarket graph image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This is enabled through some of the new payment protocol message types such as InvoiceRequest, ProtocolMessage and EncryptedProtocolMessage.\n\nBIP 75 Addresses BIP 70 Concerns\n\nBIP 75 addresses some of the privacy and security concerns with the payment protocol that former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer, Gavin Andresen and former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn outlined in BIP 70.\n\nBIP 75, unlike BIP 70, has end-to-end encryption. The co-authors of BIP 75 are Matt David and Justin Newton of Netki and James MacWhyte and Aaron Voisine of Breadwallet.\n\nTodd and others believe that BIP 75 could make it easier to trace bitcoin payments to real-world identities or simply streamline AML and KYC compliance for bitcoin. Another issue is whether this BIP should be in the main BIPs section of the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository.\n\nThe Reddit thread drew calls for a boycott of Breadwallet.\n\nJustifiable Censorship?\n\nPieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core contributor, said removing the BIP would amount to censorship.\n\nBut Todd pointed out that a proper BIP for a colored coins standard was denied access to the GitHub repository.\n\nTodd said, BIP 75 “institutionalizes” (regulatory compliance) in a convenient way that everyone can easily use and expect. He said the bitcoin community should comply with AML KYC regulations only grudgingly. He compared it to creating a standard for Tor logs.\n\nBIP 75 Can Infringe On Privacy\n\nBIP 75 does, in fact, make it easier for companies to collect data on customers.\n\nThere has always been a threat of government forcing retailers to collect identifying information about customers, but BIP 75 has the potential to streamline this process.\n\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Todd said he is more concerned about bitcoin senders identifying themselves than recipients.\n\nOn the other side of the debate, BIIP 75 is an opt-in protocol. To which Todd countered that blacklists can also be implemented in an opt-in manner, which doesn’t merit supporting their use.\n\nHow Invasive Is BP 75?\n\nJustin Newton, Neiki CEO, one of BIP 75’s authors, told Bitcoin Magazine personality-identifying information sent with a payment protocol can only be seen by the transaction’s receiver and sender. Newton said another layer of encryption protects against the data being “man in the middle.”\n\nA BIP 75 user does not have to trust their own device to keep payment information private when using a hardware wallet, Newton said.\n\nNewton agreed with Todd that there is a slippery slope toward AML and KYC compliance. Newton, however, said compliance will be required if bitcoin is to reach the mass market and it should be done in a way that protects privacy, fungibility and bitcoin’s permissionless, open nature. Without such values, there will be hidden systems that do the same thing without taking into account the community’s concerns.\n\nBreadwallet, according to a Reddit comment, is not interested in BIP 75 for reasons of regulatory compliance, but for its user friendliness. BIP 75 allows features found in more mainstream applications like human-readable address books and transaction logs.\n\nUsers can track transaction history on their own, but BIP 75 simplifies the process.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin startup Subspace develops BIP70 payment requests protocol\n\nPrivacy/Security Versus Ease Of Use\n\nTorpey, after summarizing the positions, offered some analysis of the debate.\n\nThe debate boils down to one of privacy and security versus easy-to-use wallets. Is abandoning some early principles worth mass market adoption?\n\nIn the case of BIP 75, there is not a major trade off. All personal information is encrypted end-to-end. Users do not give up more information that would not already be known by a transaction recipient. Keeping in mind this is a layer 2, opt-in protocol.\n\nAt the same time, the community must remain vigilant against efforts to apply traditional financial regulations to the blockchain. Bitcoin’s core value is the ability to transfer value across the Internet in a manner that is censorship resistant.\n\nThose needing bitcoin for payments are those who would otherwise be locked out of traditional systems like credit cards and PayPal.\n\nBIP 75 is not a major move in the wrong direction. But bitcoiners should refrain from attaching identifying information to transactions as much as possible.\n\nThe real problem in need of attention is for enhanced privacy features.\n\nWhy Breadwallet Supports BIP 75\n\nJames MacWhyte, Breakwallet director of product management, said BIP 75 puts users in full control of how much information they share and who they share it with. He said it is a huge improvement in privacy and a building block to making bitcoin more accessible.\n\nMaintaining security and privacy requires avoiding address reuse, he said, but manually sending a new address each time one receives money is cumbersome. BIP 75 will allow Breadwallet to automatically give out payment addresses only to those the user trusts.\n\nBreadwallet will never require personal information of its users, he said.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""The Scene is generally known as a network of 'pirate' release groups mostly interested in sharing content among each other. In these circles money is rarely discussed, but one relatively new group has broken this taboo with a call for Bitcoin donations. Thus far the result is rather disappointing.\n\nWhile ‘pirates’ don’t always come across as well-coordinated, the groups that make up the top of the piracy pyramid abide by strict rules and traditions.\n\nThis is particularly true for the more traditional release groups that belong to The Scene. These groups are highly organized and only share content among themselves through topsites. At least, that’s what they are supposed to.\n\nScene groups “race” against each other and their ultimate goal is to be the first to release a certain title. The more races they win, the more credit they earn, simple as that.\n\nFor most release groups it’s their reputation that counts. Money doesn’t play a major role in this game. Of course, some cash is needed to buy equipment and other gear, but the topic is generally not discussed, neither are calls for donations.\n\nBreaking with what may be described as a taboo, one Scene group has decided to cross the bridge.\n\nStarting recently, TV Scene group “spamTV” is including a call for support in their release notes, as the screenshot below clearly shows.\n\nspamTV NFO calling for donations\n\n\n\n“SUPPORT OUR CAUSE! BTC = 13mSLHHhmK5MUdtdcVVkmuJW9997EZpfM4,” a note in their NFO file reads.\n\nThis is the first time we’ve seen a Scene group publicly asking for Bitcoin donations through one of their releases. Given that Scene releases are supposed to stay private, we also wonder who the call is for.\n\nWhile it may be unique for a Scene group, donations are more common among other pirate sources. P2P groups, distribution groups, and torrent site owners generally cater to a much wider audience, and many ask their users to chip in.\n\nUnfortunately for them, pirates are not known as the most generous bunch, so the income from donations is usually minimal, to say the least.\n\nThis isn’t very different for spamTV. After listing their request for Bitcoin donations in several releases, they have yet to earn their first penny.\n\nUpdate: spamTV informed TorrentFreak that they were not the first group to accept Bitcoin donations. PoWeRUp did the same in 2014.\n\nHowever, spamTV emphasizes that the reason to ask for donations was to pay for the “hobby.” Going forward spamTV will stop asking for donations.\n\nspamTV donations so far\n\n"", 'Mas, antes de avançar sobre as explicações para esse fenômeno, convém recapitular noções de base.\n\nSem intermediação de bancos centrais ou instituições reguladoras, o bitcoin se propôs a carregar o DNA de dinheiro virtual. Quando você vai à banca da esquina para comprar um jornal, paga à vista e recebe o troco também em dinheiro, trata-se de uma transação rápida, sem intermediação e sem necessidade de trocar informações pessoais com o dono da banca. No universo dos meios de pagamentos eletrônicos convencionais, no entanto, as transferências e compras dependem de números de cartão de crédito, boletos, etc. Nesses casos, é necessário ao menos um intermediário e as transações identificam sempre pagador e recebedor. “O bitcoin é na internet o que a nota de 20 euros, por exemplo, é no mundo físico. Para realizar um pagamento de forma imediata, anônima e sem custos, só é preciso criar um endereço bitcoin, não importando onde a pessoa esteja”, resume Rodrigo Batista, CEO do Mercado Bitcoin.net, site brasileiro que intermedeia compras e vendas de moedas virtuais.\n\nNão há emissor oficial que possa ser identificado, como um banco central. As moedas são criadas por uma rede descentralizada de computadores capazes de resolver problemas criptográficos. Qualquer um pode “gerar” bitcoins desde que o computador em questão tenha capacidade de processamento para isso e que a pessoa possa arcar com os custos de energia elétrica para mantê-lo trabalhando. Os que criam bitcoins são chamados “mineradores” e são remunerados por isso. A tecnologia foi desenhada de maneira a que, nos primeiros quatro anos, fossem criados 50 bitcoins a cada 10 minutos e que, a cada 4 anos, a produção caísse à metade. Agora no início de julho, deve recuar de 25 para 12,5 unidades produzidas a cada 10 minutos.\n\nNewsletter Economia Receba no seu e-mail conteúdo de qualidade Assinar E-mail cadastrado! Logo você receberá os melhores conteúdos em seu e-mail.\n\nAssim, a perspectiva de mais uma redução do ritmo de oferta deve ser entendida como uma das razões da forte valorização recente do bitcoin.\n\nO pesquisador de sistemas financeiros da Duke University Marcelo Prates avança outra explicação: o forte aumento da demanda na China. “O controle de capitais pelo governo da China destinado a evitar a saída de recursos parece estar impulsionando a busca por bitcoins, uma vez que seria maneira mais fácil de mandar dinheiro para qualquer parte do mundo”, observa. Como é baixo o volume em circulação (estimado hoje em apenas 15 milhões de unidades), qualquer movimento mais forte acaba por puxar para cima o valor da moeda.\n\nOutro pesquisador da área, o professor da FGV Alberto Luiz Albertin prefere destacar o que chama de amadurecimento do mercado. Para ele, um sistema eletrônico de pagamentos mais descentralizado, menos burocrático e que permita o anonimato tende a ganhar aceitação. “Hoje as pessoas estão mais dispostas a operar sem intermediários, como, por exemplo, no crowfunding (financiamento coletivo pela internet)”.\n\nNo entanto, como meio de pagamento, uma das três mais importantes funções da moeda, o bitcoin pouco progrediu. Em geral, a aceitação da moeda virtual se restringe a um certo número de bares descolados, pousadas e galerias de arte.\n\nÉ importante lembrar também que, pelo anonimato e a rapidez no pagamento, é bastante utilizada em transações ilegais relacionadas ao tráfico, lavagem de dinheiro, etc. E o uso do bitcoin para fins ilícitos pode crescer com a disseminação de acordos de troca de informações financeiras automáticas entre os governos dos países desenvolvidos.\n\nAssim, como meio de pagamento de bens e serviços, não emplacou; como investimento, ainda se restringe a opção de investidores de perfil aventureiro. Mas, como forma de transferir dinheiro, tem se destacado. A tecnologia chamada blockchain, que garante o registro geral de transações de bitcoins, protegido por criptografia, foi recentemente classificada pelo presidente do Itaú Unibanco, Roberto Setubal, como uma “revolução” por possibilitar a redução de custos de transações “num nível de segurança realmente espetacular”.

07/04/2016,"['A market study conducted by research and analysis firm Juniper speculates that bitcoin valuation will spike this year, citing the prospect of a Trump presidency in the US. Furthermore, the study finds that bitcoin transactions are speculated to exceed $92 billion in valuations this year, more than tripling the $27 billion value scaled in 2015.\n\nIf presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential elections, the ensuing turmoil on world markets could lead to bitcoin thriving in such an environment, states a new study by Juniper Research.\n\n“If Donald Trump becomes President of the US, there is the very real prospect of turmoil on world markets – the Economist Intelligence Unit ranks his Presidency within the Top 10 global risks,” wrote research author Dr. Windsor Holden.\n\nNotably, he added:\n\nHowever, Bitcoin would thrive in such an environment, at least until the impact on major fiat currencies becomes clear.\n\nTo draw a parallel, economic and geopolitical uncertainties in Greece last year led to a bitcoin rally at the time. The price of the cryptocurrency took a fall later in the year when a pro-EU party won the majority vote during the country’s elections, influencing bitcoin price yet again.\n\nUncertainties with a Trump Presidency\n\nThe Economist published an assessment in March 2016 wherein an analysis of Trump’s policies, or lack thereof in their clarity, was among the top 10 global risks facing the world, beyond the economic landscape.\n\nAt the time, The Economist ranked and analyzed the factor with the following indicators:\n\nModerate probability, High impact; Risk intensity = 12\n\nIn its latest revision of the Trump presidency factor on June 15, those indicators had changed:\n\nHigh probability, High impact; Risk intensity = 16\n\nSome of the global economy-centric takeaways from the Economist’s analysis are:\n\n“He has been exceptionally hostile towards free trade.”\n\n“Has repeatedly labelled China as a “currency manipulator.”\n\n“Alienation of Mexico and China in particular, could escalate to rapidly into a trade war.”\n\nFactors Behind Bitcoin’s Gains in 2016\n\nA press release by Juniper also attributed the rise in bitcoin price to three key factors.\n\nThey are:\n\nThe uncertainty of Brexit, pre-Brexit: Observers and economists have frequently pointed to conditions of economic and political uncertainty and instability as reasons for investors to look for safe havens. “Bitcoin’s price rose in the weeks leading up to the referendum, dipped briefly but sharply when it appeared that Britain would vote to remain in the EU, before recovering when the true result became apparent,” the research report read.\n\nA Weakening Chinese Economy: A stuttering economy, weak forecasts and a fall in the value of the yuan have led to economic uncertainty among Chinese investors flocking to bitcoin as a store of value. One major Hong Kong English daily deemed Bitcoin as China’s “new darling”.\n\nThe Upcoming Halving: The imminent block reward halving that is expected to occur before around July 10th will see the supply of bitcoin reduced. Along with plenty of other market speculators, the research also sees bitcoin price spiking higher as a result of the halving event.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The former Secret Service agent convicted in the theft of Bitcoin from the Silk Road during their investigation is accused of stealing even more than previously thought.\n\nAccording to newly released documents, Shaun Bridges, one of two federal agents caught stealing during the Silk Road investigations, is accused by prosecutors of stealing an additional $700,000 worth of Bitcoin. Bridges is currently serving a 71-month prison sentence for the initial theft.\n\nGovernment knew Bridges had access to the seized Bitcoin\n\nAccording to the recently released documents, the Department of Justice knew that Bridges still had access to the private keys for the Bitcoin being held at that time by the Secret Service. The Department of Justice alerted the Secret Service to this fact and strongly advised them to move the Bitcoin, however their recommendation was ignored and the funds remained vulnerable. As a result, Bridges was able to complete the theft.\n\nRoss Ulbricht remains in jail, seized Bitcoin auctioned off\n\nLast month, $16 million worth of Bitcoin previously seized in the Silk Road case was auctioned off in Australia. The funds were seized through civil asset forfeiture from patrons of the Silk Road suspected of attempting to purchase narcotics or other prohibited goods and services.\n\nSilk Road founder Ross Ulbricht remains in prison for life without the possibility of parole.', 'It was early May when the Swiss town of Zug convened a city council meeting. By the end of it, bitcoin was accepted as a valid mode of payment for municipality services, part of a pilot program.\n\nFintech-friendly Zug, a picturesque and serene town on the banks of lake Zug made headlines in May after gaining the distinction of the first municipality or locality in the world to accept bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was accepted by the city council as a part of a pilot program, enabling adopters and users to pay for municipal services with the cryptocurrency. The program launched on July 1.\n\nThe considerable media coverage that followed the city council’s move surprised Zug’s mayor, Dolfi Müller. Zug had already garnered a reputation for being innovation-friendly with relaxed controls and regulation. Still, Müller had a statement for bitcoin, specifically, in quotes attributed to German broadcasting agency Deutsche Welle.\n\nHe stated:\n\nWith Bitcoin, we’re sending a message. We in Zug want to get out in front of future technologies.\n\nThe pilot program will see the city council initially limit bitcoin payments to its equivalent to 200 Swiss Francs. The ceiling exists due to the volatility that comes with bitcoin valuations, Müller said. The town is using an exchange to convert bitcoin into Swiss francs, immediately upon receiving the cryptocurrency.\n\n“That’s what the exchange is for, it saves us from losing huge amounts in nanoseconds,” Müller added.\n\nZug is also known for being one of the world’s lowest tax regimes, making it an economic hub for world trade where commodities are frequently exchanged. About 3% of the world’s petrol, crude oil or refined, is traded through Zug and the neighboring town of Baar. The two towns are already home to some 20 Fintech companies, earning it the notable nickname of a ‘Crypto Valley.’\n\nThe pilot program will run until the end of 2016. An analysis and report will follow to gauge the response and potential of accepting the cryptocurrency before a decision is made to continue with bitcoin’s acceptance by the city council.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin was created to revolutionize the way we pay for things.\n\nThe decentralized control, quick payment processing and blockchain technology Bitcoin championed was intended to disrupt the status quo in payments.\n\nThe Bitcoin platform was released in 2009, and was created to give the power of payments to the people using it.\n\nNo longer would you have to rely on a bank to verify transactions. The people who use Bitcoin double as the verification method using a technology known as the ""blockchain.""\n\nThe widespread nature of Bitcoin means it can\'t be controlled by a malicious government or a single company. No single person has power over Bitcoin, and any changes to the payment system would have to be agreed upon by a majority of the people using it, a refreshing change from other payment methods.\n\n""Bitcoin is a very successful proof of concept for a peer to peer electronic cash system, which allows for the transfer of value over the internet without the need for a trusted third party,"" Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said in a note to clients.\n\nIt\'s now becoming clear that bitcoin is unlikely to succeed in getting rid of cash or credit cards. There are too many barriers to its widespread availability. That doesn \'t mean it\'s a failure, though. The technology that Bitcoin popularized is being put to use in other exciting areas now.\n\nBarriers\n\nIt turns out that Bitcoin\'s biggest feature, its decentralized nature, is also one of its biggest weaknesses.\n\nLet\'s illustrate the problem with an example.\n\nImagine sending money to a family member who is overseas, but accidentally typing in the wrong account number. On the Bitcoin network, you would have to contact the account you mistakenly sent money to and have them agree to send it back. If you had used a bank or credit card, the central power could resolve the issue, and refund your account with the money you mistakenly sent.\n\nEven if you manage to correctly send Bitcoin to your family member, they would have to find someone willing to trade their new Bitcoin into currency they could use locally.\n\nThe decentralized nature of Bitcoin actually hurts it in an example like this.\n\nAdditionally, in developed nations, a central power often help suppress volatility and increase adoption. It\'s hard to convince a user that Bitcoin is the best payment option when systems issued by banks and government entities are just as fast and easy to use.\n\n""When we compare Bitcoin to centralized systems on messaging, settlement and regulation, we believe that overall centralized systems come out on top, and consequently we do not believe that banks and the card networks (Visa/MasterCard) are at risk from disruption,"" Horowitz said.\n\nBitcoin\'s impact on payments\n\nDespite it\'s shortcomings, Bitcoin is not a failure. It has succeeded in highlighting several problem areas in current payment systems, and people are working on a number of different options for utilizing the technology Bitcoin popularized.\n\nMajor banks are investigating the practicality of a \'blockchain\' technology, for example.\n\nAutonomous Research has called the technology a "" game changer ,"" and Goldman Sachs has said the technology "" has the potential to redefine transactions .""\n\nThe estimated annual budget for blockchain initiatives on Wall Street is $1 billion.\n\nGoldman Sachs recently published a report highlighting practical use cases for blockchain outside of finance, including applications in the sharing economy, electricity market and in property.\n\n""Groundbreaking innovations have often come from not one but many different technologies coming together,"" Horowitz said.\n\nBitcoin could provide a framework for incredibly quick microtransactions, which would revolutionize several industries.\n\nImagine the streaming music services, like Spotify and Apple Music, paying an artist a small amount of money every time you play a song. This happens now, but is done slowly and is hard to track.\n\nPlumbing a database of music with a Bitcoin like technology would allow artists to be paid immediately for people listening to their work, and the system could theoretically work across streaming services.\n\nBitcoin also has interesting applications in the Internet of Things.As more of our everyday objects start connecting to the internet, the potential for small micropayments increases.\n\nImagine your dryer, fridge and AC all communicating with each other and talking to the power grid to barter over power usage. A decentralized, Bitcoin like system could allow these devices to all talk to each other. Instead of having to be connected to a centralized hub the devices could provide their own smarts.\n\nThe possible applications of Bitcoin technology are potentially infinite, and are only just starting to be realized.', 'European digital currency users can now trade Bitcoin and Litecoin on SpaceBTC, the latest Bitcoin exchange in the region.

At present, SpaceBTC allows users to trade Bitcoin and Litecoin. But soon enough, the platform will be introducing other currencies and commodities as well.\n\nIn a statement to the media, the CEO of SpaceBTC Denis Donin has said –\n\n“We’re proud to finally present our service to the Bitcoin community. It has been over a year of an active development process, but all the efforts have paid off, as there has been loads of positive feedback from our customers and partners after the launch.”\n\nSpaceBTC has been interacting with the banks like Barclays and blockchain intelligence firms like Chainalysis – an alumni of Barclays Fintech Accelerator to ensure the platform’s compliance with known Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations. In addition to it, the platform also incorporates few interesting features like a faster matching engine, SMS and Telegram based two-factor authentication systems, tight spreads, free leverage and short sales etc. SpaceBTC offers multiple payment methods for its customers to deposit money into their accounts on the platform. The payment options offered by the platform includes SEPA, OKPay, Visa, MasterCard, Moneypolo, Perfect Money and wire transfer, thereby allowing the customers to deposit fiat using the method of their choice.\n\n“We’re excited to say that it’s only a matter of days until we launch Ethereum trading as well. In bigger picture, we want to bring our service to as many users as possible, therefore we are considering penetration to new markets. Our vision involves becoming a trading multiplatform, offering instruments beyond cryptocurrencies” – Denis Donin, CEO of SpaceBTC\n\nAs per the platform’s development roadmap, SpaceBTC has Ethereum support slated to be introduced in the coming days. Meanwhile, users can benefit from the 0% trading fee promotional offer for the next 11 days.\n\nBitcoin is becoming close to mainstream in the European continent. Recently, BitStamp became the first bitcoin exchange to receive financial services license from the Ministry of Finance of Luxembourg, effectively allowing it to operate across the European Union as a recognized financial services company. SpaceBTC can definitely benefit from this improved reception of digital currency platforms among the governments and members of Bitcoin community.\n\nImage: SpaceBTC', 'On US Independence Day, Blockchain startup LBRY released a beta app and a new accompanying cryptocurrency to help artists retain control over their work.\n\nLBRY is a decentralized content-sharing platform geared towards artists, filmmakers, writers, etc. who wish to retain full artistic, and financial, control over their work.

Under the single roof, banks, financial and Fintech companies will jointly work toward the development of blockchain applications and solutions, as reported by Dutch publication Volkskrant.\n\nVermeend will spearhead the effort that will see the establishment of the new campus. The former politician is an active proponent of Fintech innovation and disruption. Notably, he was appointed as the liaison and ambassador for the Fintech sector by the government earlier this year. Vermeend’s job sees him operate as the link between Fintech companies and government regulators, tasked to find solutions for problems faced by technology firms in the financial sector. His role will also see Netherlands endear itself as a Fintech-friendly destination.\n\nThe intent behind the new campus will not necessarily mean that the participating banks and companies will choose the same distributed ledger. Instead, the campus is being built to facilitate better information and knowledge sharing between companies and banks researching blockchain technology. The location of the campus has not been revealed yet.\n\nAs reported by the publication, Vermeend stated:\n\nThere is a lot of creativity in the Netherlands. The problem is that I have spoken to twenty parties who do not know what each other are doing [in blockchain development].\n\nFurthermore, Vermeend revealed that the Dutch Ministry of Finance sees the potential of blockchain in the financial sector to be realized in the coming years.\n\nA Bitcoin and Fintech Destination\n\nOver the past few years, Netherlands been seen as a bitcoin-friendly country with the city of Arnhem, among the largest cities in the country, gaining a reputation as the world’s most bitcoin-friendly city.\n\nThe city was home to the first ever bitcoin supermarket in late 2014.

The new product is a financial instrument similar to share certificates linked to the bitcoin value, and it is available for regular investors in the stock market.\n\nThe bitcoin-linked certificate will be issued, starting July 15. The first certificates issued by the Bank Vontobel will have an approval from the Swiss Exchange for a period of 2 years. The certificates will also become available for investors in the secondary markets at the prevailing buy and sell prices.\n\nThese certifications, better known as tracker certificates will have the same value as its underlying asset, which in this case is bitcoin. In the case of volatility in bitcoin prices, the certificate value will also fluctuate in accordance with the bitcoin trading market. This way, investors will be able to tap into the benefits of bitcoin trading and make profits from the digital currency’s volatility through a conventional stock market channel.\n\nWith no clear regulations set for bitcoin trading at the moment, the Vontobel issued Bitcoin tracker certificates is one of the very few ways currently available to trade the digital currency in traditional markets. Even though the actual value of the certificate will remain same as that of bitcoin, the price may vary in secondary markets.\n\nWhether these certificates will be successful or not is another question, as trading bitcoin directly over a cryptocurrency exchange is much simpler and faster compared to trading tracker certificates. It is also worth noting that anyone can trade bitcoin against other digital currencies or fiat by just signing into a Bitcoin exchange after fulfilling simple AML and KYC requirements. But in order to trade these tracker certificates, the trader may have to go through additional formalities.\n\nBy the end of this month we will have a better picture about the future of bitcoin tracker certificates and in the near future, some of the stock traders involved in the tracker certificate may jump into mainstream bitcoin trading too.', ""The majority of Americans think the economy is rigged in favor of certain sectors at the expense of others.

This means that the average American middle-class family makes about the same as they would have in the 1990s. Meanwhile, the cost of living has skyrocketed since then. What $20 could have bought in 1994 would now take $32, meaning the US middle class is worse off today than 20 years ago.\n\nAccording to investment broker and economic pundit Peter Schiff, the US economy is facing another recession in the very near future, to be triggered by a rate hike by the Federal reserve.\n\n“[US Federal Reserve chair] Janet Yellen keeps saying we're on the road to recovery; the rate hike is just around the corner; maybe it's a bigger corner than she used to think, but we're going to round that corner; we're going to end up with these rate hikes.

This is one of Kraken’s most popular markets and will certainly improve Kraken’s Euro trading pairs.\n\nWhy CleverCoin?\n\nA graduate of Boost VC, Eindhoven-based CleverCoin was founded in 2013 and backed by the Venture Capitalists, Tim and Adam Draper. It was one of the first exchanges in Western Europe to offer regulated banking partnerships, leveraged trading and to focus on compliance.\n\nA spokesperson of Kraken says:\n\n“CleverCoin clients will automatically be transferred to Kraken’s platform on June 29, 2016. Once the transfer is completed, account holders will be directed to www.kraken.com to login, update account information, and they can begin trading immediately.”\n\nWith thousands of users on its exchange trading Bitcoin, CleverCoin provided some of the latest and fastest SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) payments compared to other Bitcoin exchanges. With the exception of their now former competitor, Kraken can learn a few things from Clevercoin and can potentially become the fastest exchange in the world of cryptocurrency trading.\n\nJesse Powell, CEO of Kraken, states:\n\n“Our M&A plans have been accelerated by encouraging news throughout the industry. Prices are rising, the regulatory picture is rapidly clarifying, and clients from around the globe are joining us in record numbers. The acquisition of CleverCoin will empower Kraken with greater liquidity and a significantly expanded customer base in Europe, our flagship market.”\n\nIn April, the Euro pair weekly volume already grew at an amazing rate with the BTC-Euro pair having a 4 x increase and the ETH-BTC pair also had a 9 x increase giving sufficient reasons why Kraken should acquire CleverCoin’s European exchange. This should give the same results as Kraken’s Coinsetter and Cavirtex acquisitions which resulted in an increase in trade volume for CAD pairs.\n\nKarsten Nilsen, CleverCoin CEO, says:']"
07/05/2016,"['STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Tuesday stricter rules on the use of virtual currencies and prepaid cards in a bid to reduce anonymous payments and curb the financing of terrorism.\n\nVirtual currency exchange platforms will have to increase checks on the identities of people exchanging virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, for real currencies and report suspicious transactions.\n\nUnder the Commission’s proposals the threshold for making anonymous payments with pre-paid cards was lowered to 150 euros ($167.28) from 250 euros.\n\n“Member states will be able to get and share vital information about who really owns companies or trusts, who is dealing in online currencies, and who is using pre-paid cards,” EU Commission First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said.\n\nFollowing attacks in Paris last November by Islamic State militants the EU executive said it would step up measures to cut off terrorists’ access to funds.\n\nFrench authorities have proved that pre-paid cards were used by the Paris attackers.\n\nPrepaid cards are issued by a wide range of operators including banks using major networks, such as Visa and MasterCard. They are different from debit and credit cards because they need to be loaded before payments can be made, but can carry substantial amounts of money.\n\nMasterCard said it supported the Commission’s objective of strengthening the security of prepaid cards while ensuring that people less well-off could still use them.\n\nThe proposed higher controls on virtual currencies and pre-paid cards “are important in tackling black market and terrorist financing”, said Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at ACCA, which represents the interests of the accountancy sector.\n\nThe Commission proposed increasing the amount of checks banks have to carry out on financial flows from risky third countries, namely states with poor anti-money laundering rules and difficulties countering terrorism financing.\n\nIn a bid to end tax evasion after the publication in April of the Panama Papers - which revealed widespread tax avoidance practices by wealthy individuals - the Commission also proposed rules requiring the beneficial owners of trusts to be recorded in registers that in many cases will be accessible to the public.\n\nExisting and new accounts will be subject to due diligence controls and the Commission will look into finding effective ways for each member state to share information on beneficial owners of companies and trusts.\n\n“These proposals for public registers will be welcomed by citizens and anti-corruption activists who want to follow the trail of dirty money,” Laure Brillaud, Transparency International EU policy officer, said.\n\n“However, we are concerned that it will be all too easy to evade being on the registers in the first place by gaming the rules on trusts. By simply nominating a non-EU resident as a trustee the secrecy can carry on as before,” she added.\n\nTuesday’s proposals will need to be approved by the EU Parliament and EU states before they become law.', 'Global concern over the possible election of Donald Trump, along with other macroeconomic concerns, could lead to a massive jump in bitcoin transactions, according to a new report.\n\nThe digital currency that is increasingly being linked to spikes in price during times of economic instability would likely experience such a spike following a Trump election, Juniper Research has found.\n\nIn interview, research author Windsor Holden said that it was specifically Trump\'s ""aggressive attitude"" towards China and Mexico and ""bellicose statement towards Muslims"" that have him and some other economists concerned.\n\nHolden, who is also Juniper’s head of forecasting, said that Trump’s ""hostility to free trade"" could lead to the imposition of tariffs and that his threats to ban Muslim’s from entering the US could serve as a recruiting tool for jihadists.\n\nHolden told CoinDesk:\n\n""Should these outcomes come to pass, then there will clearly be a substantial negative effect on numerous national economies, including the US itself. Hence, should it appear that a Trump Presidency is a distinct possibility, expect a marked uplift in the volume of bitcoin transaction(s) – and in the value of bitcoin itself.""\n\nMore than Trump\n\nA depreciation in the value of the yuan and uncertainly over Britain’s departure from the European Union are also both cited as reasons why bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a hedge investment.\n\nThat, coupled with the reduction in bitcoin supply as a result of the halving of bitcoin’s mining reward this month, could potentially lead to bitcoin transactions reaching $92bn this year, triple what it was at the year’s beginning, the report said.\n\nIn March, the Economist included Trump on its list of the Top 10 Global Risks published earlier this year, which was also included in the Juniper report.\n\nUncertainly in China and the impending exit of Britain from the EU were also named, and since its release, both China’s economic struggles and Britain’s departure from the EU have been connected with recent spikes in the price of bitcoin.\n\nIncreased adoption\n\nIn addition to perceived global instability as a result of various socio-economic considerations, the Juniper report cites increased adoption as a factor.\n\nSpecifically, the report mentioned reduced cost of processing, reduced fraud risk, and the easy of cross-border transactions as factor in the increased adoption.\n\nFrom the report:\n\n""Given bitcoin’s continued upward trajectory and the likelihood that this will continue prior to the halvening, we believe that for 2016 as a whole, transaction value is likely to be at or around 3.5 times that in 2015.""\n\nImage credit: Joseph Sohm / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It also observes the financial markets and interprets global macroeconomic developments, as it becomes the first Swiss issuer of a tracker certificate on Bitcoins for subscription.\n\nThe Vontobel certificate on Bitcoin in USD is a classic tracker certificate (SSPA: 1300) which offers investors a simple means of investing in Bitcoin.\n\nPhilipp Krall, Director and Advisor, Financial Products, says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“The idea of the product is to give investors the possibility to participate in the development of the Bitcoin price in USD without having to own Bitcoins themselves. Rather they can participate by owning a simple bankable asset, namely this tracker certificate. The product is particularly suitable for investors who anticipate a rise in the acceptance and significance of Bitcoin as a way of payment and as an alternative currency.”\n\nVontobel investment certificate\n\nWith this investment certificate, investors in Switzerland will for the first time be able to participate in the development of the Bitcoin price vs the USD. The certificate has a two-year term. An application has been submitted for admission to the SIX Swiss Exchange subject to Bitcoins being approved as a means of payment.\n\nBetween the first day of trading on 15 July 2016 and the final fixing on 16 July 2018., investors will be able to trade the Vontobel certificate on the secondary market i.e. buying or selling at the applicable bid/offer prices.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin price\n\nKrall explains:\n\n“The fixing is done on the 15th of July. This means that we will buy the Bitcoins according to the subscriptions that we have received from clients on that day. The average price at which we will trade the Bitcoins will be the fixing price. The product will be redeemed on the 23rd of July 2018. After that date, depending on the market environment and the client interest, we will possibly issue a new product. Concerning the secondary market: We will be the market maker for this product. So investors can buy this product from us and sell it back to us.”\n\nKrall says the impact of the product on the price of Bitcoin “will most likely be very low.” However, with Vontobel’s 22 international locations which identify and analyze trends, and subsequently create innovative investment strategies and products, along with having been named ""Leading Brokerage Firm"" for Swiss equities since 2011, what will become of the new development could best be imagined.', 'The Argentinian subsidiary of international ridesharing giant Uber is turning to bitcoin amid what has been described as a crackdown by local authorities on its operations.\n\nBitcoin industry startup Xapo told CoinDesk today that is has entered a partnership with Uber that allows the company to accept its bitcoin debit cards, and for users to use the payment option when traveling domestically or abroad.\n\nFirst revealed in a tweet by Uber Argentina this weekend, the action is the latest in an escalation between law enforcement and the Silicon Valley startup that centers on whether Uber is properly incorporated in the South American country, or acted illegally in launching its product in the country.\n\nTo date, the dispute has seen police raid the homes of individuals suspected to be connected with the company, as well as actions taken against domestic payments providers to prevent them from processing Uber transactions, according to AFP.\n\nXapo representatives said they see the event as a way to boost adoption of the startup\'s product, which allows users to load the debit card with bitcoin, and for that bitcoin to be converted at the point-of-sale in purchases over traditional card rails.\n\nXapo product manager Anni Rautio told CoinDesk:\n\n""This is a win for all local Uber users and drivers, and for Uber as a company, as they are able to continue operations in Argentina through Xapo\'s Debit Card. It\'s also great news for bitcoin: it\'s one step closer to seeing mainstream companies adopt bitcoin.""\n\nRautio said that the partnership began last week, and that Xapo has already seen an increase in interest for its debit card product following the announcement.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen whether this will boost bitcoin use in the region, local news sources report 550,000 users have downloaded the app and the situation seems likely to continue. Uber officials have called resistance to its startup in Buenos Aires the “fiercest” it has experienced around the world, all the while showing signs it intends to push forward in an effort to serve users.\n\nPrior to the partnership with Xapo, Uber Argentina had made other alternative payment methods available including CardNow, Papipago and Neteller.\n\nImage credit: Prathan Chorruangsak / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Akin Fernandez is the owner of bitcoin voucher service Azteco and an active technology blogger under the pen name \'Beautyon\'.\n\nIn this piece, Fernandez offers his take on the upcoming halving of the bitcoin network subsidy and what it means for those who risk ""being left out"".\n\nVery shortly, there will be an important scheduled change in the way bitcoin is generated. The rate at which new bitcoin is created will halve, an event popularly referred to as ""the halving"".\n\nAt the time of this writing, 3,600 BTC ($2.4m) are generated every day. This will be slashed to 1,800 BTC per day ($1.2m), and the rate will never ever increase.\n\nTaking this into account, and some basic economics, we should be able to make predictions about how the perception of bitcoin may change, but since the perception of bitcoin is almost entirely irrational, save for the thinking of a handful of very clever men, it is almost impossible to predict how people will react to the halving.\n\nBitcoin was designed to be released onto the market in a slow and predictable way. This was done to incentivize the security of the network through its generation as well as limit the supply of bitcoin so that it could attain a nominal value and not ""flood"" the market. This plan has worked spectacularly well, and is a further testament to Satoshi\'s understanding of economics (The Austrian School) and human behavior.\n\nFrom a plain utility perspective, nothing will change when the rate of bitcoin creation halves. You will be able to transact with your bitcoin normally and won’t notice any difference at all. As for the effect on the price of bitcoin, the price of bitcoin doesn\'t matter if you are using it as a money transporter.\n\nYou put $100 in vitcoin in at one end, send it over the network to your recipient, and she can either redeem $100 or spend that same value on Amazon via a service like Purse, or anywhere that accepts bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin’s price is irrelevant to the user if a company’s business model adapts to bitcoin’s true nature.\n\nIt is also important to bear in mind that the finite nature of bitcoin doesn\'t impede its long-term, low-level flexibility. Improvements can be made to the protocol, increasing capacity, guaranteeing anonymity and ensuring its distributed nature, all without touching the central benefit of bitcoin; its guaranteed limited money supply.\n\nFurthermore, the amount of money that can ""fit into"" bitcoin before and after the halving will not change. The amount of fiat currency that can fit into bitcoin is infinite. Bitcoin can absorb all the money that currently exists in the world, and yes, that would be a good thing.\n\nBitcoin history bunk\n\nEach bitcoin has a history attached to it. You can explore where a bitcoin has been using one of the many Bitcoin Explorer tools, one of the best being OXT’s Graphalizer application.\n\nBecause bitcoin is not anonymous (or well understood), there is a false idea that bitcoin can be “tainted” by circulation. This is why some businesses with bitcoin surveillance tools close the accounts of users that receive bitcoin from what they wrongly consider to be ""tainted addresses"".\n\nFresh bitcoin is bitcoin that has just been mined and which has never been spent. It has no transaction history, and nothing can be assumed about it, other than that it its spendable; it is ""clean bitcoin"" to their thinking, in this incorrect mental picture of bitcoin.\n\nObviously, the idea that there is ""clean bitcoin"" and ""dirty bitcoin"" is completely absurd; bitcoin is data, and everything people think about it is imputed. There isn\'t a strong market for “fresh bitcoin” yet, so that should not be a factor at all in the halving.\n\nIf it were, we would expect the price of fresh bitcoin to at least double. There probably won’t be a market for fresh bitcoin in the future when Bitcoin is more anonymous, which is the only perceived advantage of fresh or ""history-less"" bitcoin.\n\nSpeculative boost\n\nPerception changes however, could cause the price of bitcoin to spike. The halving of bitcoin’s generation rate is likely to cause an increase in speculation.\n\nAnyone using bitcoin as a speculative investment will be interested in the halving. Simple supply and demand says so… or maybe not; Bitcoin exchanges are not rational yet.\n\nIt is reasonable to speculate that logically, this event and the others that will follow will increase the price and perception of bitcoin’s structural stability. People may start to understand that this halving is one of several to come, and now is the time to get into bitcoin before subsequent reductions in production kick in on schedule and the price spikes again.\n\nIt all depends on how you choose to use and view bitcoin.\n\nOne thing we can say for sure; bitcoin is an exceptionally stable system that is absolutely immutable. It is slowly beginning to dawn on people that you can rely on bitcoin to exhibit a fixed set of characteristics that cannot be changed by public opinion, a handful of men with a particular use case, or the desires of anyone who chooses to use it for any purpose.\n\nThe \'C\' of money\n\nThe need for immutable international standards has been understood for centuries. It is impossible to perform trades for goods if everyone is using a different standard for weights and measures.\n\nThis is why the definition of the meter was very carefully specified in 1875 in The Treaty of the Meter at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Sevres, France. Thirty prototype standard lengths made of platinum-iridium ally in an “X” profile were manufactured to exacting standards and distributed to different countries.\n\nBy doing this, every country was ""on the same page"" when it came to the definition of the word ""meter"".\n\nToday, the metre is defined as the distance travelled by light in 1/299 792 458th of a second. Bitcoin is like the length of a meter; a global standard that is securely set in the same way that one of the fundamental forces of nature is unchangeable; the speed of light, ""c"".\n\nYou can use the definition of a meter for any purpose. You can use it to produce rulers of wood or steel, or use it to create rulers made of light. The purpose of a meter is to act as a point of reference, a standard, that cannot change. Bitcoin is the same. It is not there to piggyback your political views or be an aid for your flawed business model, any more than the meter is there to aid cartographers over carpenters.\n\nYou must deal with bitcoin on its terms, in the same way that you deal with measurement standards and mathematical constants.\n\nOnce people begin to understand what the idea and impact of a global, math-based, non-governmental standardized monetary unit means (and the fact that you can transact with something that acts as a fundamental force of nature), the entire idea of what money is will change forever.\n\nThis has profound implications for every economic process and every person on Earth.\n\nThere are only 5,286,750 BTC left to be issued by the network.\n\nCompared to the value of all the goods and services on Earth, this is a small number, taking into account that each bitcoin can be split into a million pieces. Clearly, bitcoin is one of the most undervalued systems, services, databases, assets, networks or tokens (depending on your application) currently available to man, and even if an ultimate total utilization is never realized, the truth of what bitcoin is cannot change because it is based on maths, and not people’s opinions.\n\nEven if bitcoin absorbs 10% of all global commerce, it will be spectacularly useful and valuable.\n\nAbove all other considerations, this is the fundamental breakthrough; Bitcoin is an opinion-less, irresistible standard system based only on math.\n\nIt is globally available as an infallible means of exchange, and accounting without any new functionality being required. It belongs to no single country, is incorruptible, unstoppable and completely eliminates payer fraud.\n\nThe 2016 halving and the others that will follow as the bitcoin generation curve tops out are key points where this should be reiterated as a warning to those who still refuse to accept the consequences of bitcoin’s existence and the truth of math.\n\n""A danger foreseen is half avoided, and a man warned is half saved"". The danger is being left out of bitcoin.\n\nFor more on the upcoming bitcoin rewards halving view our complete article series here.\n\nFear of missing out image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

I was more inspired to get involved when I saw how the marketplaces were developing and after I started Gyft, I realized it was another way of improving payments, globally.\n\n\n\nCT: Do you think Bitcoin will ever reach true mainstream status, or do you think it will always remain something of a fringe currency?\n\nVL: Bitcoin will need to get to the $3-5k level to go mainstream from a liquidity standpoint as a currency. It will also need some major improvements in the usability for consumers to use it as a currency - notably, payments should never be quoted in decimal points (""It\'s 0.00145 BTC for a cup of coffee please, sir""). As an industry, we will move there I think once we get to higher price points. Also, I think there are far more interesting use cases for Bitcoin that don\'t involve currency and these use cases could find millions or billions of people using Bitcoin every day, without knowing they are using it.\n\nBitcoin in South Africa\n\nCT: What does the Bitcoin scene look like in South Africa?\n\nVL: It\'s up and coming, but still a way to go.

I really think that Bitcoin has far superior network effects that make other cryptos more speculative.', 'China is turning its attention to Bitcoin and generating massive amounts of Bitcoin as concerns grow over the vulnerability of the global financial sector says Chairman of China Smartpay Group.\n\nA recently published article of Joe Zhang’s in the South China Morning Post highlights the fact that while the Chinese government is cautious about Bitcoin there are in fact plenty of active exchanges in the country with a large number of Chinese individuals taking part.\n\nZhang, however, states that there are two points, which are interesting to look at. Namely that China is an overbanked country providing banking access to the rich and poor where it only takes ten minutes to open a bank account, and Chinese banks and post offices provide good services for money transfers.\n\nHe says:\n\nIt’s hard to imagine Bitcoins enabling cheaper and more efficient money transfers.\n\nOf course, he states, there can only be one reason why Bitcoin is rising in popularity in China: the country’s fear of inflation. However, while Zhang says that many people believe that the high volatility of the cryptocurrency will prevent it from becoming a currency, he thinks otherwise.\n\nHe says:\n\nThe price of gold, and the exchange rates of the Russian ruble and the Nigerian naira for example, are just as volatile and that has not prevented them from being used as currencies. More importantly, Bitcoin users treat their holdings as part of their asset diversification, therefore the high price volatility does not matter much, as long as the long-term trend is up.\n\nZheng talks about the how the rate of inflation continues to be a major concern for the Chinese people and how the Nationalist government collapsed due to inflation in 1949 with the Chinese government refusing to accept the existence of inflation between 1949 and the late 1980s. Unfortunately, for China over the past 25 years’ inflation has swept through the country, which has produced a negative impact on inequality.\n\nZheng states that in the past ten years, the prices of properties have risen, raising alarms while the Chinese stock market continues to be one of the most expensive in the world.\n\nSo it is small wonder that Bitcoin is becoming a popular hedge against the steady erosion of the yuan’s purchasing power.\n\nImage from Flickr.

07/06/2016,"['Many supporters have come to see bitcoin as a model of the perfectly secured digital good.\n\nThis view owes itself in no large part to the blockchain, the distributed database that secures units of the digital currency by allowing miners to add and verify transactions without a third party. But, as has long been detailed by academics, the balance of incentives that keeps the blockchain in operation is ever at risk of disruption.\n\nPerhaps the most infamous potential attack, known as a \'51% attack\', would find a single entity introducing a version of the blockchain that it controls and is accepted as valid. While academics have argued attacks can be carried out with a smaller percentage of the network, at 51% of the hashrate, such an attack would be almost guaranteed to work.\n\nTo date, this threat has reared its head rarely, but new changes to how the bitcoin network incentivizes key participants have stoked fears that a 51% attack could again become viable.\n\nFor example, some are worried that the upcoming decline in the number of new bitcoins minted daily will lead to a corresponding drop in the number of miners that today rely on this income to pay for their operations, thus securing the blockchain. Miners compete to add new blocks to the blockchains, receiving newly minted bitcoins as a reward.\n\nExpected to occur on 9th July, the event brings this theoretical attack into context, given that exactly what will happen when the halving point is reached is unknown.\n\nPractically, with fewer bitcoins being produced per block (from 25 BTC today to 12.5 BTC after the halving), the reward for mining may also be reduced by half, should the price of bitcoin fail to increase. This has led to concerns that smaller miners could be driven out of business, further concentrating the share of the marketplace controlled by the biggest players.\n\nWhile the general feeling is that a 51% attack is unlikely, it is still worth looking at why the threat is a concern for the bitcoin network, as well as all blockchains that rely on an economic incentive for participants.\n\nUnderstanding how a bad actor can affect the bitcoin community as a whole can help to shed light on the vulnerabilities that lie in blockchain-based networks – and what can be done to reduce them.\n\nBitcoin\'s mining makeup\n\nAs of today, transaction verification on the bitcoin blockchain can already be seen as being controlled by a small number of influential participants.\n\nAs of early June, 70% of all hashrate came from just four Chinese mining pools: F2Pool, Bitmain\'s AntPool, BTCC Pool and BW.com, a percentage that, combined, represents a majority control of the bitcoin market.\n\nFor some, this has long been seen as a failing in bitcoin\'s design, as it was ultimately supposed to serve as an egalitarian platform where anyone who owned a computer could join and profit from the network.\n\nWhole other blockchain networks have been founded, and alternative technologies created, in an attempt to solve this perceived issue.\n\nSo, what does this mean in practice? Should bitcoin\'s leading participants band together to act in self interest, it could mean that the authenticity of the bitcoin ledger could be compromised.\n\nAs demonstrated in a 2014 paper from Cornell University, a colluding minority that intentionally forks the blockchain by keeping their block discovery private can create a situation where other miners find all of their efforts for naught.\n\nThis is important as the blockchain remedies conflict between varying versions through contrast; when comparing two blockchains, the longer blockchain is considered the most authentic. A longer private forked branch can – theoretically – give the colluding minority that controls it the power to approve or reject transactions as they seem fit.\n\nThis presents the potential to put a blockchain squarely in the control of a centralized authority. While this remains a theoretical possibility, the mining pool Ghash.io did reach 50% of the network’s total in 2014.\n\nTo some, events like this mean that network decentralization remains a priority.\n\n""Centralization of miners could definitely pose a threat to bitcoin,” said Adam Draper, the managing director of Boost VC. ""It’s a reflection of how human nature can play a role in even the most mechanical of creations.""\n\nPolitical influence\n\nStill, when asked, most bitcoin advocates feel that a 51% attack is not really a realistic threat to bitcoin security, if only because it is economically self-destructive.\n\nIn the face of the upcoming halving, market observers like Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, who operates a hosted mining service, believe that bitcoin\'s market is likely to consolidate even further.\n\n""The upcoming halving certainly increases contraction of the hashpower to fewer large scale mining farms that are built up at places with the lowest electricity costs and optimal infrastructure for mining,"" he said.\n\nStreng went on to add that while the major miners could create centralized authority, doing so would betray the individual miners’ market share. According to Streng, the miners are motivated by profit to stay separate entities.\n\nStephen Holmes, the CTO of the Digital Banking Lab at IT consultant VirtusaPolaris, agrees with Streng. He added that a 51% attack only works if the attacker is willing to sabotage the very currency it controls.\n\nBut there are some who believe such large-scale threats are worth monitoring, given that, one day, the goal is for large entities, even whole nation states, to participate in running bitcoin.\n\nSay, for example, that China was to follow Ecuador’s lead and create virtual money based on the yuan? Would it be unthinkable to think that domestic mining pools may collude with the wishes of the state if enough pressure is applied?\n\nThese are considerations that might need to be considered when looking at the possible future of the technology.\n\nBad actors\n\nUltimately, the true threat in any commercial endeavor is those that would take advantage of it for their own gain.\n\nAs anyone that has organized any large group can attest, there is nothing that can really be done to exclude those that – as Michael Caine put it in the film ""The Dark Knight"" – ""just want to watch the world burn"".\n\nStill, smaller threats may be just as notable.\n\nWhen polled on what is the true threat to bitcoin users, many identified bitcoin theft as the most pressing issue.\n\n""The more likely threat comes from exchanges and wallets getting compromised, resulting in stolen coins,"" said Arian Evans, vice president of product strategy at cloud-based security firm RiskIQ.\n\nAs this illustrates, the true fate of a cryptocurrency lies in the good faith of its users, and given the scarcity of bitcoin, an available supply that is dynamic enough to support new additions to the community.\n\nUltimately, as fiat currency is subject to theft and counterfeiting, bad actors will try to find a way to exploit cryptocurrencies for their own purposes, meaning threats like the 51% attack will always be a concern.\n\nDraper added:\n\n“It is something to be aware of and keep our eyes on.”\n\nChess piece image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Unfortunately for Bitcoin evangelists, the company claims that the majority of transactions come from one of two places: online gambling or the darknet. The background to the story is that CoinLab, which incubates Bitcoin-related businesses, sued Mt. Gox in 2013. The firm alleges that Gox chief Mark Karpeles hid a quantity of the cryptocurrency in his own pockets to defraud customers. As a consequence, CoinLab says that it began developing Oden as a way of tracing the blockchain for ""bad money movements.""\n\nOden\'s trick is to search through the blockchain for repeated addresses, like the tip jar code for a website. While Bitcoin\'s original architecture is designed to obscure each transaction, human nature tends towards laziness. As such, websites like The Pirate Bay used the same code on its front page, presumably to avoid losing repeat donations. But these repetitions also allow third parties to start finding patterns, and from there, understanding behaviors. Add in the use of vanity addresses and it\'s not long before tying Bitcoin activity to individuals is, at least theoretically, possible.\n\nNaturally, both companies aren\'t offering up real data as to the efficacy of their respective platforms, but the trend is telling. The technologies that underpin Bitcoin are often spoken about with reverence by many companies, but Bitcoin itself is not. 2016 has seen the platform lurch from one negative story to another, from criminal charges, through Craig Wright\'s public meltdown, all the way back to Mike Hearn\'s damning indictment back in January. The fact that companies are now boasting that Bitcoin is no longer anonymous could deliver a fatal blow to the cryptocurrency.', 'The Argentinian government blocked credit card companies from dealing with Uber, causing the ridesharing company’s national branch to use Bitcoin instead.\n\nThe city of Buenos Aires issued orders both to the national communications agency (ENACOM) and credit card companies to block the Uber app and deny the company use of credit card service. This prompted Uber to partner with Swiss Bitcoin company Xapo to enable payments through Bitcoin debit cards.\n\nPart of an ongoing war against Uber\n\nThe ride-sharing company has faced harsh resistance in Argentina, particularly in Buenos Aires. Taxi unions sued the city and Uber, resulting in a judge issuing an injunction to stop ride-sharing services in the city. Later, both a prosecutor and a judge ordered ENACOM to block the Uber app within the city limits. Finally, both the consumer protection agency of Buenos Aires and a judge ordered credit card companies to cease doing business with Uber.\n\nAs a response to this perceived threat to the taxi industry, the transportation agency of Buenos Aires has announced development of a taxi app. This app, dubbed BA Taxi, is expected to help provide a government-sanctioned answer to the convenience of Uber’s app.\n\nUber users adapting and using Bitcoin\n\nBy and large, Uber’s customers are adapting well to using Bitcoin through Xapo’s debit card, for which Uber gave a $30 discount. Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, President of Bitcoin Latam and CEO of RSK Labs, sees Uber’s typical customer as being willing to embrace new technology.\n\n“In general Uber users are highly knowledgeable about technology and more prone to Bitcoin understanding and usage, fears about Bitcoin usually come from more illiterate users.”\n\nAccording to Franco Amati, co-organizer of the Latin American Bitcoin Conference (laBITconf), most users have flocked to Bitcoin rather than lose Uber.\n\n“Nobody is deleting Uber app because of this, on the contrary, I have friends that requested Bitcoin debit cards to use Uber. Most of them from SatoshiTango, since there they have an option for a virtual debit card, so they do not even need to wait for a physical card to be delivered. But others from Xapo too as card issuer.”\n\nAmati also notes that Uber’s difficulties from authorities were what prompted this sudden explosion of interest in Bitcoin.\n\n“Also, have in mind that Uber was not accepting these cards a month ago. They added them because in Argentina all local cards are blocked by the government from using Uber (even when these cards are used outside of Argentina).”\n\nBitcoin keeps growing in Latin America\n\nLatin America has seen its Bitcoin scene grow amid economic hardships. Puerto Rico recently defaulted on its debt, leaving creditors without $800 million in payment. Meanwhile, the central bank of Mexico raised interest rates to counter a devalued peso.\n\nZaldivar is optimistic about Bitcoin’s future in Latin America as the cryptocurrency becomes an increasingly attractive option compared with government money.', 'At 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time the day of the Brexit vote, the men’s and women’s winner of the ongoing Wimbledon Championships, the professional tennis tournament that is perhaps the biggest international sporting event held in the United Kingdom each year, were slated to receive $3,003,200 in prize money. Less than 24 hours later, that figure had dropped over 9% to $2,727,609, according to a tweet from ESPN sports business reporter Darren Rovell, due to a dramatic free fall in the pound.\n\nWhile few people will lose sleep over what is likely to be two already highly compensated professional athletes losing out on nearly $300,000, it’s yet another, if minor, illustration of how drastically life changed for some following June 23, when Britons, in a close vote, elected to depart the European Union.\n\nOf course, Britain’s decision to bolt the EU follows years of financial and market turmoil, both in Europe and across the globe. Economies as disparate and geographically disconnected as France, Brazil and Japan are still struggling to cope with the aftershocks from the financial crisis, along with a long list of institutional and structural challenges. As a result, the world’s central bankers are continuing to adopt extraordinary measures in an effort to spur more growth, including, most recently, negative interest rates.\n\nBut given how universal such easy money policies have become, currency valuations have vacillated wildly from country to country as investors have sought safety, and that has created greater levels of volatility than this market has seen in decades. The Brexit vote has only exacerbated this trend.\n\nTo a very large degree, therefore, it’s reasonable to conclude that the only thing central bankers have accomplished since the end of the financial crisis is to offer near definitive proof that they have next to no ability to provide permanent fixes for ailing economies. Think about Europe, where a decades-long partnership of 28 countries is coming undone, in part, due to the fragility of many of its members’ economies. Or Japan, which has instituted negative rates and continues its swoon. Or the United States, which no doubt remains the strongest, most creative and healthiest economy in the world but nonetheless is still weighed down by lower than usual growth rates and stagnant inflation, despite an aggressive and active Federal Reserve.\n\nWith all this in mind, it might be time to accept that master central banking and planning policies simply do not work. Perhaps the ‘leave’ voters were right, even if the short-term consequences they brought upon themselves could be dire: Maybe individual sovereignty is a better approach.\n\nAnd if you take this argument one step further, this is where the concept of alternative currencies begins to make more sense. All of which brings us to Bitcoin. While some investors will always gravitate to alternative currencies (think gold) during times of hyper volatility, this could be different. Indeed, whereas gold is prone to conspiracy theories and, in my view, not a good long-term investment, Bitcoin may have more lasting potential.\n\nFor one, Bitcoin is easy to store and can be used to make purchases. That alone makes it a better alternative than gold. But in the grander scheme of things what really makes Bitcoin attractive relative to other currencies is a practice known as ‘halving,’ a little understood process outside the Bitcoin world that, when weighed against broader global financial trends, could help it gain more widespread adoption and put it in prime position to grow going forward.', 'Bitcoin hasn’t lived up to the salvation rhetoric, but the digital engine behind the currency may be about to change the world\n\nHave you heard the good news? The blockchain is here – and it’s going to save everything.\n\nIf you aren’t tied to the tech community, you might not have picked up on this salvation rhetoric. But you probably have heard of bitcoin, which burst into the public consciousness before imploding dramatically in 2014.\n\nBut now, bitcoin is starting to look less important than the engine that drives it – the blockchain. It was created to solve a problem that had been puzzling digital activists for decades: how to create digital property without a central authority keeping track of who owns what.\n\n\n\nThe answer to that question, first proposed by bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was to create a decentralised digital ledger, keeping track of every transaction made, and with its accuracy guaranteed through the combined honesty of the entire network.\n\nThe core of the idea is to get computers burning energy in order to prove that they are trustworthy, and stamping that trust on the “blocks” of recorded transactions. You could still lie to the network – but you’d need to burn more energy doing so than every honest participant, combined.\n\nBitcoin was the first technology to use the blockchain, but the currency is now starting to look a bit like the steam pumping engines invented in the 17th century. Yes, it’s ingenious, but the real revolution comes when the underlying technology is used for something altogether new.\n\nAnd now for something completely different: some positive news Read more\n\nAnd so the technology world has fallen over itself to find out what that invention could be. A permissionless, distributed, trust-free network has the power to revolutionise not just financial technology, stock markets and banking, but also the music industry, digital access in some of the world’s poorest nations, and could even ensure your Italian extra-virgin olive oil really is from Italy.\n\n\n\nAnd yet sceptics warn that the waste at the heart of the blockchain is not worth the marginal improvements. Anyway, what harm is there in a little bit of centralisation?\n\nChain reaction\n\nFor its first five years of existence, Bitcoin overshadowed its engine in technological circles, as the price of one coin fluctuated from nothing, to $31, to $2, to $266, to $100, to $1,250, to $200 (it currently stands at $700, following a post-Brexit boom).\n\nThe blockchain, intended to document bitcoin transactions, can also be used as a distributed ledger for … well, anything. If it can be recorded digitally, it can be written on a blockchain and kept beyond the reach of controlling states, malicious attackers and those who would rewrite history.\n\nInitially, this took the form of what became known as “coloured coins”. The idea was that a particular sliver of bitcoin could be permanently marked with some other property: say, ownership of a stock, or a plot of land. It can be thought of as taking a marker and writing on a £5 note: “Whoever holds this also owns one common share of Apple stock” – except that thanks to modern cryptography, the signature cannot be forged, the £5 cannot be falsified, and everyone can see when it changes hands.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bitcoin has experienced a post-Brexit boom. Photograph: Benoit Tessier/Reuters\n\nFor a long time, the ability to use the blockchain in this way was treated as an interesting side-effect of bitcoin’s role as a currency, but the tenfold collapse in the currency during 2014 prompted many who had invested in the bitcoin ecosystem – whether financially or intellectually – to seek other uses for the underlying technology.\n\nLondon’s Provenance, for instance, aims to use the same technology to provide a transparent trustworthy platform for presenting the history and, well, provenance of a business’s products. The company has gone through some changes since it was launched in 2013, and the blockchain now forms a core part of its offering. The idea is that a Chilean vineyard can, for instance, publicly share a bottle’s origin in its fields, and track it throughout the chain of production, all the while recording its statements publicly for posterity. At the end of the chain, a shopper can check a tag on the bottle and find out precisely what happened in its journey.\n\nOthers aim to preserve the financial core of the blockchain concept, while returning some establishment credibility to the project. In May last year, New York’s Nasdaq announced it was exploring the potential of using coloured coins to track stocks.\n\nNasdaq’s head, Bob Greifeld, was optimistic, saying: “Utilising the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities. Once you cut the apron strings of need for the physical, the opportunities we can envision blockchain providing stand to benefit not only our clients, but the broader global capital markets.”\n\nIt is also becoming clear that it will no longer be accurate to talk about “the” blockchain. Instead, there are many blockchains, as companies are born with different needs from a distributed ledger than those of Bitcoin. Perhaps the most innovative of them is Russian-Swiss company Ethereum, formed around the idea of using the same sort of network to do much more than record information.\n\nThe true fascination of bitcoin is not its mystery inventor | Dominic Frisby Read more\n\nCreated by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, the Ethereum network allows users to create “smart contracts” that can be automatically executed by any computer running the Ethereum software in exchange for the network’s own currency, “ether”, creating one gigantic distributed computer for hire. Advocates insist the idea could change the world of computing, allowing for digital smart locks that open when a fee is paid, or letting musicians release songs for collaborators to rebuild in real time.\n\nEthereum gained its biggest public exposure following the creation of a smart contract, called the decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO), intended to be a sort of crowdsourced hedge fund. Investors could buy into it, and vote on where the pool of cash it controlled was invested, before splitting their share of the pool and cashing out. But there was a major flaw in the code behind it: it was possible to write an infinite loop of cash-out instructions, taking your share of the DAO out over and over again. One user noticed this in early June, and managed to steal $50m worth of ether before the flow was stemmed.\n\nMore generally, the undeniable potential of the blockchain has led to it becoming one of tech’s newest buzzwords; companies with little good reason to use a distributed ledger throw it in their business plan anyway, in the hope of getting an extra $25m from venture capitalists eager to cash in on the trend.\n\nEven for those uses where it can be transformative, blockchain technology still comes with its downsides. The mining process that underpins the whole technology is a colossal waste of energy, for one thing.\n\nMore fundamentally, sometimes centralisation can be a good thing: a fraudulent credit card transaction can be reversed by the card company, but stolen bitcoins are gone forever.\n\n\n\nThis article is part of the Guardian’s Half Full series.

(Full disclosure: I do own some bitcoins and ether at time of publication; ether is the built-in currency or ""fuel"" of the Ethereum network. Like bitcoin, it is mined on computers all over the world.)\n\nEthereum is a year old in the marketplace, and has already briefly flirted with a US $1.5 billion market valuation. Despite this crazy vote of confidence from the crypto market, the technology is still new. Bitcoin had many problems in its first couple years that required correction or tweaking.\n\nOne time in August 2010, an attacker exploited a vulnerability to issue more than 184 billion bitcoins out of thin air. A fork was needed to heal from the attack.\n\nA slightly less staggering 2,600 BTC were lost in October 2011 due to a malformed address.\n\nFurther, at least as a user and crypto enthusiast, this muck up provides interesting insight into the already interesting mind of Ethereum\'s wunderkind creator, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nButerin, one of Bitcoin\'s earliest adopters and a cofounder of Bitcoin Magazine, developed Ethereum alongside some of the world\'s most skilled cryptographic minds when they realized Bitcoin\'s scripting language was simply too restrictive to allow for many kinds of next generation use cases for a blockchain.\n\nAnd this is where the corporations find Ethereum attractive. Buterin actively shares his development vision via personal reddit and Twitter accounts. ""A serious bug in ethereum itself is sufficient to warrant a fork,"" he recently posted on reddit. Unlike Bitcoin, whose pseudonymous creator hasn\'t been heard from in nearly six years, corporations developing on Ethereum\'s blockchain have a sense that any future protocol-level shipwrecks will be righted... as is being done right now with the community\'s probable hard fork response to the DAO hack.\n\nBitcoin is already one of the most incredibly complex breakthroughs in money since the dawn of banking itself, and Ethereum is even more complex both in implementation and eventual market scope, so it is certainly understandable why some are shy to learn about yet another blockchain-based project... can something so complex be good?\n\nTo a user who posted about Ethereum possibly being ""over-engineered,"" or too complex, Buterin popped in to offer his thoughts: ""iPhones are incredibly over-engineered below the surface. It often takes a lot of complexity at the bottom and at middle layers in order to make the top look clean and shiny (though ethereum\'s philosophy is certainly to favor complexity in the middle over complexity at the bottom wherever possible for consensus/security reasons).""\n\nAll this creator-driven handholding is quite alien in mercenary crypto-libertarian land, but it may be exactly what the corporations on the sidelines need to see, especially as the stakes and the use cases for blockchain tech get larger over time.\n\nAlready, famed musician Imogen Heap is reportedly using the Ethereum blockchain to handle the payments/online downloads side for her new album; Reebok is reportedly using Ethereum to validate the authenticity of a high-end sneaker line, and it\'s no secret in the community that global banking giant UBS is testing Ethereum for use in settling transactions or as an eventual ""smart bonds"" platform.\n\nBitcoin isn\'t going anywhere: $137.2 million in 24 hour trading volume and a $10.6 billion market capitalization make it the undisputed king of cryptographic assets.\n\nBut there\'s clearly something about Ethereum...\n\nI don\'t think we\'ve heard the last from this complex one, or from Vitalik Buterin, Taylor Gerring, & crew.\n\nEspecially now that cryptocurrency titan Coinbase accepts Ether, many of Bitcoin\'s existing millions of users are likely to read into Ethereum a bit in the months ahead, if not give the tires a kick and take it for a spin.']"

However, bitcoin trading would thrive in such an environment, at least until the impact on major fiat currencies becomes clear.”\n\nOther reasons for Bitcoin value increase\n\nEven though the Economist Intelligence Unit have listed Trump’s possible presidency as a high global risk, former presidential candidate Darryl W. Perry, who spoke to CoinTelegraph, and was the first presidential candidate in the U.S. to accept Bitcoin, thinks it’s unlikely that Trump would have an impact.\n\nDarryl W. Perry says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“It seems to be pure speculation that Trump would have more of an impact on the markets than Hillary. Further, I don’t see the President or any elected official impacting the price of Bitcoin unless there is passage of regulations.”\n\nOther reasons for the predicted rise in the price of Bitcoin includes uncertainty over Brexit, China’s weak economy, and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which Perry believes is likely to have more of an impact on the price of Bitcoin than if Trump became the next president.\n\nLess demand for U.S. dollars - higher price of Bitcoin\n\nHowever, Jeff Berwick, founder of Canada’s largest website Stockhouse and founder of the Dollar Vigilante, the fastest growing financial newsletter in the world, and the first major financial newsletter to cover Bitcoin regularly in 2011 near $3, said to CoinTelegraph that while he predicts that Hillary will win the election, should Trump win and if his ‘protectionist policies’ are implemented, they would have a negative effect on demand for U.S. dollars.\n\nBerwick explains to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Less demand equates to a fall in value and, therefore, the price of all other things, including Bitcoin, would rise in U.S. dollar terms.”\n\nMain drivers of Bitcoin value - usage and central banks\n\nSince June, the price of Bitcoin has hit highs of around $780 per bitcoin with a year-to-date growth of around 56 percent. According to Berwick, the main driver of the value of Bitcoin is usage.\n\nBerwick says:\n\n“The more people who use Bitcoin increases demand for Bitcoin, which increases its price. The second biggest driver of U.S. or other fiat money price in Bitcoin is central bank money printing and confidence in the system.”\n\nBerwick believes that more money will eventually be printed while a continuing decrease in the fiat money system will help to drive the price of Bitcoin higher.\n\nHe concludes:', 'Bitcoin exchange Coinbase said on Thursday it received a $10.5 million investment from Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU), the bank’s Mitsubishi UFJ Capital unit, and Sozo Ventures as part of a strategic partnership involving its long-term expansion.\n\nCoinbase, which is the world’s largest bitcoin company and currently operates in 32 countries, does not operate in Japan just yet, though it runs an exchange in Singapore. The company said Japan is a big part of its international expansion.\n\n“BTMU will be a strong partner for us both in Asia and globally,” Sam Rosenblum, international expansion and banking lead at Coinbase, said in a phone interview with Reuters. “Japan will certainly be an important market for us and one that is pretty critical for the development of digital currencies.”\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that enables users to move money across the world quickly and anonymously without the need for third-party verification.\n\nRosenblum said San Francisco-based Coinbase has been working with BTMU for about a year on various projects and those collaborations have culminated in a strategic investment.\n\nSozo Ventures, which has dual headquarters in Silicon Valley and Tokyo, early on has been instrumental in bringing Twitter to Japan.\n\nIn order for Coinbase to do business in Japan, it would need regulatory approval from the country’s Financial Services Agency.\n\nRosenblum said there is no timetable as to when Coinbase would launch operations in Japan.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter\n\nCoinbase last year raised $75 million from a slew of investors. The BTMU investment is an individual transaction and not part of any funding round, Rosenblum said.\n\nCoinbase currently has two trading platforms, one for retail investors and one for institutions. Over the last four weeks, trading volume for the two platforms totaled around $400 million, according to Adam White, Coinbase’s vice president for business development.\n\nSince bitcoin’s inception in 2009, it has grown in popularity and price. Late on Thursday, bitcoin traded at $621.74 on the Bitstamp platform. So far this year, the digital currency is up 44.2%.', 'Bitcoin, a currency with the promise of anonymity and no government regulation, is a potential hotbed for nefarious activities.\n\nOn Wednesday (July 6), London-based bitcoin startup Elliptic announced that it was teaming up with International Watch Foundation (IWF), a non-profit in the UK that monitors online child abuse, to curb the cryptocurrency’s role in the spread of child pornography.\n\n“Over the past few years, we have seen an increasing amount of bitcoin activity connected to purchasing child sexual abuse material online,” IWF CEO Susie Hargreaves said in a press statement. IWF has identified over 68,000 URLs associated with child pornography.\n\nElliptic’s role is to identify all forms of illicit activity on the bitcoin blockchain, the public ledger that’s shared amongst users to easily keep track of transaction information. Elliptic flags illicit activity for financial institutions and law enforcement agencies. Under the partnership, IWF has provided Elliptic with a database of bitcoin addresses associated with child sexual abuse content for the company to monitor.\n\nThe web-based digital currency relies on algorithms to move money around quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority like Paypal or a bank to process transaction according to Elliptic chief executive James Smith. “This makes bitcoin great for remittances, micro-payments, and small business transactions,” said Smith. “Unfortunately, these same properties of decentralized, international value transfer also make bitcoin appealing to criminals.” Beyond child pornography buyers and sellers, the platform also attracts drug dealers and arms dealers.\n\n“By tagging evidence of criminal activity in our database, such as child exploitation, we are able to alert our customers when criminals are attempting to transact through their systems,” Smith told Quartz.', 'Is the scaling effort leading to Bitcoin’s privatization? NodeCounter.com accuses Blockstream of crippling Bitcoin for financial gain.\n\nSince Blockstream got involved in the scaling of Bitcoin, the issue of Bitcoin privatization has sprung up.\n\nBlockstream President Adam Back is of the view that a plan for scaling Bitcoin to handle more users over the next few years would double the on-chain transaction capacity on the network three years in a row, while simultaneously allowing for the development of layer-2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, which could allow for millions or billions of transactions per second across the network.\n\nTo shed light on what it is, Back explained that Lightning Network transactions are real Bitcoin transactions that could be posted to the Bitcoin blockchain as a valid transaction though with a caching mechanism that collapses them so they don’t all need to be sent to the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Core in the pay of Blockstream?\n\nHowever, a main critic of this plan is NodeCounter.com, which accuses Blockstream of “currently paying off many of the key Bitcoin ""Core"" software developers” and having “directed the crippling of Bitcoin in order to provide the solution, for their own future, financial gain.”\n\nNodeCounter.com posted in a public service announcement:\n\n“These Blockstream-paid Bitcoin developers (for the Bitcoin ""Core"" software) are enforcing a limit on how much information can be transacted in Bitcoin. This is limiting the number of transactions to just 3 per second, approximately. Blockstream is concurrently developing a ""solution"" to this problem, called the ""Lightning Network"". This ""solution"" is to be placed on top of the crippled Bitcoin network to allow it to scale. Blockstream will monetize the Lightning Network in the form of fees required to use their service.”\n\nThe following are views from two individuals with interest in the subject. Please note that one of them has chosen to be anonymous. However, we don’t have any reason to believe that the non-disclosure of his identity has any major impact of his views as shared via email.\n\nLightning Network as the solution\n\n“Lightning allows Bitcoin network participant to process settlements with a lower time and CPU costs comparing to a traditional Bitcoin blockchain,” says Mike Harrier, CTO BitcoinChain.com. “In case a substantial number of users choose to utilize this mechanism, one can argue that the scaling problem is solved.”\n\nThe anonymous respondent differs on this. The writer says LN is not a solution for scaling on-chain transactions as there is no tech for that yet.\n\n“LN scales off-chain transactions, it’s quietly using smart contracts to execute behind the curtain. But it is a great scaling solutions nonetheless. LN It’s just not perfect and not how users would like to see it. It’s controversial, implementation of LN requires some trust in Blockstream – there is no guarantee LN will be decentralized. You can read a very good explanation of LN tech here ”\n\nLN is like a payment network, where everything happens very quickly and scales perfectly, but it does not happen directly as Bitcoin’s Blockchain. And in the moment user would like to “withdraw “ Bitcoin from LN, scaling wouldn’t be this good. The plan is the majority of transactions will happen via LN, this way LN will work perfectly.”\n\nBlockstream created a problem to provide a solution?\n\nHarrier will not agree with the statement that the problem was created to provide a solution because Blockstream formalized a potential problem and speeded up its solution through certain ideas and concepts that secure the future of Blockstream\'s business.\n\n“Nevertheless, the growing daily transaction number has recently become a more apparent problem, which may lead to some organizations not being able to maintain their operation rate without such a solution,” he said.\n\nThe anonymous contributor considers the claim controversial, saying Blockstream looks in the future with views that differ from Satoshi’s.\n\n“They don’t say it straightforward, but they do think that Bitcoin shouldn’t be for everyone. They don’t want to create super free, decentralized, open and cheap payment network. Probably because they think it’s not a viable choice for Bitcoin,” the writer stated, adding that increasing blocksize would help Bitcoin at the moment as blocks are full because of huge amount of microtransactions and fees are growing.\n\nThe contributor claims that Blockstream is doing what would make Bitcoin less appealing to the public.\n\n“I suppose they could increase blocksize to 2MB, but right now it is the matter of principle. Bitcoin with big blocks would be totally different from Bitcoin with small blocks, but with LN and SegWit. First one is mostly for people, the second one is mostly for business. Blockstream’s plan has been to make Bitcoin a business. They are succeeding so far, the problem emerged because of Bitcoin popularity and huge community energy and ambition. But it’s only natural that community and “board of directors” (metaphorically speaking) would want different things.”\n\nDanger of Bitcoin privatization\n\nNodeCounter.com noted on its page that the only way for the private company, Blockstream, to be removed as the central authority over a crippled Bitcoin is for miners and pool operators (not users) to adopt a different implementation of Bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Classic as a failure to do so will result in “Blockstream\'s paid Bitcoin Core Developers to have unfettered control of the Bitcoin system for their own financial gain.”\n\nHarrier thinks privatization should not be implemented. He said Bitcoin has always been and will continue to be, first of all, a monetary unit.\n\n“Even Lightning Network uses bitcoins as a collateral. Therefore, from my point of view, privatization should not be the case.”\n\nThe anonymous contributor says what is about to happen is not privatization, citing conspiracy theories, but a change of philosophy. “It’s basically impossible to privatize Bitcoin – too many people own Bitcoins, too many history, too many losses if this happens, and most important – it won’t function properly without its blockchain, which can’t be privatized.\n\nPrivatization talks are just conspiracy theories. But - Bitcoin could (and probably will) become much more centralized.\n\nCommunity’s idol is Satoshi Nakamoto, who wanted Bitcoin to be different from what it is now. But Satoshi is not here, he is not participating in Bitcoin development. Part of community feels that his views are outdated (they are even having proposals to update the whitepaper).\n\nThe only person who totally has been sharing his philosophy is Gavin Andresen, who had been a lead developer for a long time. Current devs pushed him out of the project, this was kind of ugly.\n\nThis also says something – they are trying to replace everybody with the “old views”. There is a “danger” of Bitcoin to be much more centralized. It would be totally different from the way it has been supposed to work. It would be a disappointment for people who have been believing in Bitcoin for years, but Bitcoin will live without these people. If Blockstream is here to stay (and it seems that it is), Bitcoin will be different.”\n\nProposed way out\n\n“I am confident that what we currently witness is global financial mechanisms being established,” Harrier says. “Thus, I wouldn\'t like to be affiliated with any party supporting any particular proposal. In my opinion, we all are definitely going to use smart contracts more in order to make settlements easier and faster. It\'s hard to predict whether side chains such as Lightning Network will be required. In any case, it is crucial that the active community participants put substantial effort in finding mutual understanding and a collaborative optimal solution to such problems.”\n\nThe anonymous writer proposes three ways.\n\n“First one – nothing happens. Bitcoin will probably be successful under Blockstream. It will bring miners the money, it will bring traders the money, and it will bring Blockstream and VCs the money. Bitcoin will lose its spirit and philosophy, but, basically, who needs it except relatively small group of people? There is need of progress too, and it’s hard to achieve without people who are getting their pay check regularly. Second way – rebellion happens. Right now opposition is relatively small, but if (for example) Satoshi will come back or/and Chinese miners suddenly will change their minds, or Blockstream screws up majorly, then Bitcoin will fork, and Bitcoin XT, Classic, Unlimited or some new fork will be executed as a main fork. Bitcoin will change. Blockstream will be pushed out of project. This way fully depends on miners (China). Third way (idealistic) - Current devs will change their minds and philosophy and will go back to their roots. Bitcoin will be improved with LN, SegWit and everything else, but it will be for the greater good, not for the business causes. First one is more likely to happen. This is not a way out, this is a way all in. Second way is the only way out. Third one is a pure fantasy.”\n\nHe concludes by saying:', 'Uber is facing strong opposition in Buenos Aires, where the company has been operating since mid-April without a permit or tax-identification number. The massively funded startup is being sued by taxi unions. City officials have issued multiple injunctions attempting to bring its service to a halt. And credit card companies have been blocked from processing Uber payments on locally registered cards.\n\nIt takes more than that to stop Uber, however.\n\nThe ride-hailing company is working with bitcoin startup Xapo to circumvent the credit card roadblock, one of its more pressing barriers to service in Argentina. Xapo helps consumers buy, store, and spend bitcoin, a virtual currency. One of the ways it does this is with the Xapo card, a Visa-branded debit card that allows its holders to spend their bitcoin with any merchant who accepts Visa.\n\nThat Xapo’s card uses bitcoin is beside the point to Uber in Argentina. (In fact, the company said in a statement that it does not accept bitcoin as a currency.) What matters instead is that the card isn’t issued locally, but out of Gibraltar, and therefore not blocked from accepting Uber payments under the city’s regulations. By the same logic, someone traveling to Argentina with a US-registered credit card should have no trouble booking and paying for an Uber in Buenos Aires.\n\nThat said, the Xapo card does offer a unique solution to a related problem for would-be Uber riders in Buenos Aires—how to get a non-locally issued card. “A normal Argentinian person cannot go and suddenly open a bank account in Gibraltar,” says Anni Rautio, who is based in Argentina and heads up Xapo’s debit card. But because Xapo’s card uses bitcoin, which is digital and not controlled by any country’s central bank, it can provide cards to account holders anywhere. (Bitcoin is being used for settlement purposes on the backend; the important thing for Uber is that the transaction is on Visa’s network.)\n\n“All they have to do is set up their Xapo and receive it at home and it’s ready to use,” Rautio says. “This is a very specific situation with a very specific problem and a very specific solution.”\n\nUber declined to provide data on how many people in Argentina have signed up using Xapo’s debit card, but said it is currently doing about 18,000 trips a week in Buenos Aires. Rautio said Xapo has received “a lot of requests” from Argentinians about setting up a Xapo card now that they’ve “found an actual use to spend [their] bitcoins.”', 'Bitcoin services startup Vogogo is closing its cryptocurrency-focused payment processing service next month after it failed to gain traction, a move that comes amid the exits of several executives and reports that at least some bitcoin services will be affected in the near-term.\n\nAnnounced on 5th July, the move will see Vogogo shutting down its payments service after it completed selling its risk management business. Those two business lines were major elements of Vogogo, which raised $8.5m in venture funding in August 2014 before going public last year.\n\nThe closure is notable given the relatively small size of the country\'s bitcoin industry and Vogogo\'s position as a visible service provider in Canada.\n\nOne bitcoin exchange, Coinbase, which used Vogogo as a payments processor for the Canadian market, has been affected by the shutdown, telling customers in that country that it won\'t be able to offer support after the end of this month.\n\nOther exchanges that operate in Canada, most notably Kraken and QuadrigaX, say they aren\'t affected by the closure.\n\nVogogo has been searching for new directions – and revenue – since April, public statements show, when the company announced that its board of directors was looking for alternatives. At the time, the company said it would downsize as part of a cost-cutting plan.\n\nCFO Tom Wenz said in an interview that other assets, including an Electronic Money Institution license obtained last fall, are being looked at as revenue generators, though he said that the company wasn’t going out of business and that it has “plenty of cash in the bank”.\n\nHe said that the payment business wasn’t making enough money to keep it afloat, and that ultimately, the company opted, in a decision he said was made Monday, to close it down.\n\nWenz told CoinDesk:\n\n“The payment business, there wasn’t a lot of interest in it. There wasn’t a lot of revenue or customers there. So, the simplest way to preserve cash value to the organization was just to shut that piece down.”\n\nImpact on bitcoin services\n\nIn an email sent to Canada-based customers and later circulated via social media, exchange service Coinbase said that it wouldn’t be able to provide electronic funds transfers or Interac transfers for those clients, or store funds denominated in Canadian dollars.\n\nThose funds need to be withdrawn by 29th July, the email said.\n\nCoinbase later told CoinDesk that it was working to restore service to Canadian customers in light of the loss of access to Vogogo’s processing service.\n\n“We will adjust to this change as quickly as possible and hope to promptly restore services to our Canadian customers,” the company said.\n\nBitcoin service Celery said that about 10% of its volume comes from Canada since its integration with Vogogo in 2015, and that it hadn’t yet spoken to customers about alternatives. Founder Ilya Subkhankulov suggested that alternatives within Canada for bitcoin companies might be few and far between given the existing financial climate.\n\n“The Canadian payment processing market is especially hard to obtain access to for digital currency transaction processing because only a handful of banks have a tight grip on the payment networks,"" he said.\n\nKraken CEO Jesse Powell said that while Vogogo was the firm’s main processing service for Canadian dollars, he said the exchange had alternatives to turn to following the closure.\n\n“At the moment, we don\'t expect our clients to be affected,” Powell told CoinDesk.\n\nMultiple factors\n\nWenz framed the decision to close the processing unit, as well as the company’s broader strategic shift, as an effort to pivot away from a business model that wasn’t working.\n\nThe past several months has seen significant change within the company. In May, the board of directors created an internal group to consider new directions. Less than a month later, Vogogo announced that president and CEO Geoff Gordon would resign effective 24th June. He is set to resign from the company’s board on 10th July.\n\nIn 16th July, Vogogo announced that chief revenue officer Rodney Thompson resign as chief revenue officer. Wenz himself is set to shift to a part-time basis at the end of this month.\n\nBeyond the revenue and market traction problems, Wenz pointed to the company’s public stock as a factor. Vogogo’s stock price traded at nearly C$2 last July, according to data from Bloomberg, before suffering a 12-month decline of more than 90% that has left it trading at around 12 Canadian cents.\n\n“The current business model wasn’t being supported and that was reflected in the stock price,” he said. “Instead of burning more capital on a business that wasn’t getting support, we’re looking at other options.”\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It presents a new way for how Lightning Networks could map routing paths, as well as execute routing on-demand.\n\nIn more simplistic terms, Lightning co-founder Joseph Poon described the paper as one that moves Lightning Network away from the earlier hub-and-spoke routing models that were critiqued by members of the community as likely to lead to a more centralized node network.\n\n""With payment channels, there could be millions or hundreds of thousands of nodes connected with each other. This explores how the network could find a path from sender to recipient in a decentralized way,"" Poon told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n""It shows that nodes can have a partial view, but find everyone with a high probability.""\n\nNode neighborhoods\n\nPerhaps the most important new concept introduced by the Flare proposal is the concept of having Lightning nodes also act as ""beacon nodes"", which would provide other nodes with visibility in a local radius.\n\nOsuntokun explained that, rather than creating a hierarchy of nodes, Flare would allow nodes to select peers to behave as ""landmark nodes"" that would help others identify how to manage steps needed to relay a payments.\n\n""As a result, a node’s network view is fog of war like, with strong visibility close in a local radius, boosted by random feeler connections farther away. This allows a node to maintain routing state with space complexity logarithmic with respect to total network size, while ensuring reachability to all other nodes with high probability,” the white paper reads.\n\nHowever, Osuntokun sought to emphasize that this is just one possible solution for Lightning Network routing, and that the team behind the proposal is open to feedback.\n\n""We’re not promising this is the one true way. This strategy, I think, could work fairly well in terms of where bitcoin is headed and that will allow iterative improvements,"" Poon said.\n\nPoon further suggested that the work being conducted for Lightning could have broader implications for mesh networks, thereby decentralizing the Internet more broadly.\n\n""If you have a mesh network and you want to pay your neighbors for routing to the Internet, it’s the same tech and it’s a clear application,"" he continued.\n\nSimulation stage\n\nWhile a step forward, all parties acknowledged that this proposal is at the simulation stage, and that work will need to be done to validate the technology.\n\nFor the white paper, the Bitfury and Lightning Network estimate that the network could scale to accommodate ""millions"" of users, a figure that may or may not be enough to accommodate more than bitcoin’s existing users.\n\n""Simulations show it is enough to store paths to about the square root of the number of nodes in the network (provided nodes are reasonably well connected). For a network with 100,000 nodes, it is enough to store paths to just 600 nodes,"" the paper reads.\n\nIn addition, the paper states concerns that still linger about how Lightning Network could be successfully deployed, noting for instance, that one of the unsolved issues is how the network will incentivize a large number of global nodes to stay online simultaneously.\n\nElsewhere, the paper is similarly measured about challenges ahead, discussing how scaling this network of nodes is another challenge.\n\n""Unless the network functions efficiently, there may be little incentive for people to put their bitcoin in LN channels. Ideally, a wide array of industry and community participants would run LN nodes, helping to bootstrap the network,"" the paper notes.\n\nBitfury\'s new direction\n\nThe release also represents a significant investment from Bitfury, the bitcoin mining specialist that has been diversifying its interest into blockchain technology more generally.\n\nFor example, Vavilov said that Lightning Network is now one of the company’s “top priorities”, and that it will continue to research and test flare. Vavilov said the company has five full-time employees working on Lightning, as well as forthcoming software offerings.\n\nGoing forward, Vavilov said he sees a potential for some of this work to be commercialized, if successful.\n\n""We are in early stages of testing and research. If the Lightning Network is successful, there are many potential uses and opportunities for commercialization,"" he said, concluding:\n\n""We are heavily invested in improving the scalability of the bitcoin blockchain, and will continue to explore partnerships that bring about this reality.""\n\nFor more details, read the full white paper below:\n\nFlare White Paper\n\nJameson Lopp contributed reporting.\n\nBlackboard image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In fact, some of the features add a further polish the benefits that bitcoin and digital currencies offer, in comparison to their fiat counterparts.\n\nThe new feature of Partial Refunds, in particular, is a standout. Merchants can now refund a small part of a bigger transaction, such as refunding the fee for one canceled item out of an order that consists of several items. Legacy e-commerce portals that take payments via payment cards routinely cancel entire orders while requesting customers to place a newly revised order again. Micro-transactions and the lack of a roll-back charge come easilyy with digital currencies and this feature, in particular, will make bitcoin payments appealing to merchants.\n\nCoinbase also revealed a fix for overpayments as its most requested feature from merchants. The bitcoin company has revamped its legacy system to make it easier for customers and merchants in the event of an order wherein customers accidentally overpay for an item.\n\nA blog by Coinbase explains:\n\nIn our legacy system, we frequently saw customers accidentally overpaying for their order, whether due to transaction “miner” fees being unnecessarily added, or due to errant keystrokes. Now, when the BTC amount exceeds the listed price, the Order is automatically completed but flagged as overpaid. This way, the customer will successfully receive their items without merchant intervention.\n\nCustomers will be able to see an overpaid transaction immediately.\n\nMerchants will also have the means to refund the overpaid amount to customers with a new feature within their dashboards.\n\nThe platform is also enabling merchants with dials that help with creating a mispayment buffer, in the event of a mispayment. With the release of its v2 API, merchants will now have the means to create mispayment buffers, wherein percentages can be allocated to both ends of an item price.\n\nAlso read: Coinbase Releases ‘Buy Widget’ To Simplify Buying BTC\n\n“For example, let’s consider an Order for 10 BTC with a 1 % underpayment buffer. A customer who accidentally pays 9.9 BTC will successfully complete the order, while someone who pays 9.8 BTC will not,” Coinbase explains. This control feature, it says, gives merchants additional control of their item listings.\n\nCoinbase also revealed that it is switching to Insight, an open-source blockchain explorer that the company says will help with more reliable confirmations.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
07/08/2016,"['What’s in store for Bitcoin, the ‘daddy’ of all cryptocurrencies? Well, according to new industry research transaction values in the digital currency could almost triple to $92 billion (bn) in 2016 over last year. But with the price having risen 50% so far this year, where might the price be in six months’ time or beyond that?\n\nBitcoin recently put on rally and hit $780, a 28-month high, before dropping back around $100 in the week commencing 20 June 2016. In the run up to the \'Brexit\' outcome things were certainly stirred up it put some fire under the crypto currency. As well as a network it has its unit - bitcoin.\n\nFrom late this May to just a few days prior to the UK’s referendum on European Union (EU) membership, the price had surged almost $300. As of July 7 it was trading at around $648 - up 63% from the price this time last year at $397.\n\nIn light of this stellar Bitcoin price action, a new study from Juniper Research, a UK-based firm that specializes in identifying and appraising new high-growth market sectors within the digital ecosystem, has revealed that the total value of Bitcoin transactions is expected to exceed $92 billion (bn) this year - up around 240% from less than $27bn in 2015.\n\nBut it should be noted that the vast majority of this forecasted year-end figure - probably more than $90bn - will be accounted by transaction volumes on exchanges and relatively little spent on products. That said, Bitcoin can be used anywhere where Visa and MasterCard is accepted using Bitcoin debit cards. And, on top of that there are an estimated 60,000 Bitcoin merchants out there. More curious uses of the cryptocurrency have included buying a gold mine in Canada to being accepted by a church amongst other cases.\n\nJuniper, which published its first full report on this area in January 2015, cites reasons for the uptick in transactions as being three fold, namely Brexit, weakness in the Chinese economy and a reduction in money supply (i.e. in the bit coin unit). But a victory for Donald Trump in the US Presidential election later this year on 8 November could also play a part and potential excite things further.\n\nOne might think making such forecasts is a frought with issues. So how did they do it? Well, the methodology applied by Juniper saw them gauge the size of the Bitcoin space and, to a large extent, the altcoin space by examining the publicly available data on sites such as blockchain.info and Bitinfo.\n\nBy undertaking an analysis of this data, the firm derived daily, monthly and annualized figures on the number of cryptocurrency transactions and their value in US dollars. Additionally they also gathered information on the relative contribution of Bitcoin to the total of exchange transactions.\n\nIn terms of regional usage, China now accounts for the majority of exchange transactions for Bitcoin - if not necessarily altcoin - and that retail transactions overwhelmingly occur in North America. And, while Juniper does not have precise data on active wallet numbers, it is believed that there are ""no more than 2 to 3 million active users"" of Bitcoin at present.\n\nRecent surges in Bitcoin’s value this June helped to push average transaction values above the $1,000 mark by the second half of the month. And, Juniper anticipates that factors including Brexit and its aftermath as well as weakeness in Chinese economy amongst other factors will ensure that this rate will be achieved for much of the short term, with “further spikes possible later in the year.”\n\nFurthermore, the research firm anticipates that on a global basis, average transaction values for 2016 will reach $859, significantly higher than the average for the year to date of $623.\n\nThe rise in Bitcoin value and transaction activity has meant that the value of Bitcoin transactions in the first six months of the year is approximately 2.8 times its value in the first half (H1) of 2015. The scale of increase rises to 3.2 times when only transactions in June are considered.\n\nGiven Bitcoin’s continued upward trajectory and the likelihood that this will continue prior to so called ‘halvening’ (see below), Juniper believes that for 2016 as a whole, transaction value is likely to be at or around 3.5 times compare to that in 2015.\n\nTrump Presidential Factor?\n\nAccording to research author Dr Windsor Holden, head of forecasting and consultancy at Juniper Research, concerns around the prospects of a Trump Presidency in the US “were also likely to cause further spikes in trading and Bitcoin value later in the year.”\n\nHe says: “If Donald Trump becomes President of the US, there is the very real prospect of turmoil on world markets.” The Economist Intelligence Unit has ranked the potential of his Presidency within the ‘Top 10’ of global risks.\n\nHowever, the former Leeds University research fellow who has been an analyst for 17 years, added: “Bitcoin trading would thrive in such an environment, at least until the impact on major fiat currencies becomes clear.”\n\nThis latest research, which is contained in a whitepaper titled ‘The Future of Cryptocurrency - Deep Dive Data & Forecasting (2016-2021)’, points to the rise in values as being attributed to three key factors, as follows.\n\n1. Brexit Uncertainty\n\nBitcoin’s value is to a “significant extent” dependent upon economic uncertainty and political instability the research explains as investors seek safe havens for their assets. As mentioned, Bitcoin’s price rose in the weeks leading up to the EU referendum, dipped briefly but sharply when it appeared that Britain would vote to remain in the EU, before recovering when the true result became apparent.\n\n2. Chinese Economic Weakness\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Bitcoin trading occurs on Chinese exchanges, while the continued weakness of the Chinese economy has seen investors using bitcoin as a haven against expectations of a further fall in the value of the Yuan (RMB).\n\n3. Reduction In Money Supply\n\nThe imminent ‘halvening’, whereby the amount of Bitcoin being introduced by mining in a set time period will halve is also pushing its price upwards according to Juniper.\n\nBitcoin’s Price Rise\n\nWhen price of Bitcoin rises it usually follows some crisis in financial markets and “one should look for this” according to Simon Dixon, CEO and founder of BnkToTheFuture, a global online investment platform enabling qualifying investors to invest in financial innovation including alternative financial products, fintech companies and funds.\n\nJust take what happened with the banking crisis (e.g. Libor/Euribor rate rigging scandals with the big banks), or the recent Greek financial crisis and bailouts by the EU.\n\nAside from the Brexit outcome one could also cite economic wobbles in China over the nation’s GDP figures and stockmarkets plummeting in Shanghai and Shenzhen. And, it is in China where the largest trading volume in Bitcoin occurs.\n\nChinese Investors\n\nMany Chinese retail investors see the cryptocurrency as a hedge and a safe haven. Indeed, unlike the UK stockmarket that is dominated by institutional investors (i.e. big asset managers, pension funds and insurance companies) as opposed to retail investors, in the China it is the reverse way around where the stockmarkets are dominated by retail investors who have a high savings rate compared to the west.\n\nThe recent Chinese market turmoil and crash also reflects and underlines a “real need for a new asset class” asserts Dixon, whose company has initiated a number of successful investment rounds that span crowdfunding platforms, specialist funds that invest in financial innovation, bonds backed by Bitcoin mining and everything in between.\n\nBnkToTheFuture’s Dixon commenting on the potential for Bitcoin’s price going forward boldly says: “I think that give it in five years and there is the potential to have a $10,000 Bitcoin.”\n\nThere are a number of other factors besides that point to helping drive the price. As Dixon explains: “It has all the characteristics of a currency, a stock or commodity and a technology combined.” It’s ‘peer-to-peer ‘(P2P) with no owner and underpinned by the largest super computer in the world connecting tens of thousands of computer terminals worldwide.\n\nFixed Supply\n\n“There is also fixed supply and as long as the technology becomes increasingly useful in financial services the value of Bitcoin derives from the value of programmable money,” adds Dixon, who is the co-founder and fund manager of Bitcoin Capital.\n\nHighlighting demand for investing in the cryptocurrency, one of BnkToTheFuture’s recent fund raisings was Bitcoin Capital 1, a crypto fund designed exclusively for qualifying investors seeking to speculate on the growth in the cryptocurrency space. Managed by US broadcaster Max Keiser and Dixon himself, it was oversubscribed with almost 700 backers by 47% (£345,844) over the £735,222 target.\n\nWhat Chances $92bn?\n\nDave Pearce, Director of Nxt Foundation, which represents the business facilitators behind advanced blockchain platform Nxt, reflecting on the ‘tripling’ of Bitcoin transaction volume by year end says: “There’s definitely a chance for Bitcoin to reach $92bn in transactions, but there’s no guarantee.”\n\nHe cites factors contributing to the price rise as spanning political insecurity around world including tensions in the Middle East as well as the refugee crisis in Europe, adding that economic uncertainty from Brexit that was “only midly beneficial” for Bitcoin, which allowed it to rebound after a minor dump.\n\nAmsterdam-based Pearce further says: “More important will be the unfolding economic crises in Italy, with its latest bailout of banks already planned. Meanwhile, Asia is seeing severe problems thanks to an outflow of capital from a debt-laden China.”\n\nCentral banks are also printing money like mad. Take the Bank of Japan, which continues to print incredible amounts of money through quantitative easing (QE) to stimulate activity - without success – and don’t forget other major central banks in the US (the Federal Reserve) and the EU (European Central Bank, Bank of England). This printing is steadily devaluing the currencies of most major economies.\n\nThe Halvening Factor\n\nThe Bitcoin Halvening, or Halving is according to Nxt’s Pearce an “incredibly divisive event”, adding that: “While some think the reduced supply will drive up the price, many think that the halvening can crash the entire network.”\n\nThis would occur because the sudden halving would reduce rewards for Bitcoin ‘Miners’, which would make many miners unprofitable and lead them to make the decision to stop mining. This in turn would “increase the difficulty rate” for existing miners, which would dramatically increase transaction times and make the network slower.\n\nSubsequently this would, Pearce contends: “Cause investors to doubt the recovery of the network and the coin leading to a run on Bitcoin and as traders especially move their money into other assets.”\n\nGiven that there are significant amounts invested in Bitcoin already, investors will probably protect their investment. “Eventually also the network will just recover from diminishing miners and reset the difficulty level to increase transaction speed,” argues Pearce.\n\nHis take though is that if the halvening does have a negative effect on Bitcoin, then we will see ""a big move"" into other cryptos. “However, I very much doubt we will see all Bitcoin value move into competing crypto currencies.” Ones that spring to mind are Nxt and Ethereum, a decentralized platform that runs smart contract. The latter has its Ether unit\n\n“I think that Bitcoin will grow dramatically, even with the Halvening/Halving,” he adds. “But it will be because of investors protecting themselves and its very healthy market capitalization.” Furthermore, he posits that we will also see a “dramatic growth” in several alternative cryptocurrencies such as Nxt, thanks to what he points out and claims is their “vastly superior technology and increasing business applications.”\n\nRonny Boesing, CEO of Danish cryptocurrency exchange CCEDK that relaunched its platform earlier this month with new business services, offering another view says: “Based on today’s average of some 250 million USD 24-hour volume of transactions on CoinMarketCap it seems possible to reach a $100bn in total at the end of the year.”\n\nHe adds: “This does not in full reflect the value of Bitcoin as a lot of this is based on \'bots\' operating on the various bigger exchanges many times, giving a helping hand to push the price in the direction of the bigger ‘Whales’ out there - pumping or dumping as they please - and with amounts of 5,000-10,000 BTC used within a day to adjust or change direction of price.”\n\nBitoin’s price may well be boosted another notch due to the halving. Or, it may stay more or less as it is at currently or even decline in value as the world and many small Bitcoin miners take on the Blockchain as the tool to future progress, equality, transparency and every day food on the table. We’re certainly living interesting times but don’t discount more volatile price action.\n\nNote: A complimentary whitepaper, ‘Will Bitcoin Bite Back?’ can be download from Juniper Research\'s website.', 'North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has signed a law that defines “virtual currency” and clarifies what activity triggers licensure. The Chamber of Digital Commerce views the measure as a historical moment for state regulation of virtual currencies and blockchain technology.\n\nThe ratification of the bill, also known as the North Carolina Money Transmitter Act, follows 16 months of deliberations between the chamber, the state’s General Assembly and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks.\n\nThe General Assembly approved the bill last month, CCN reported.\n\nLaw Defines ‘Virtual Currency’\n\nThe law updates the existing laws to define the term “virtual currency” and the activities that trigger licensure. Virtual currency miners and blockchain software providers will not require a license for multi-signature software, smart contract platforms, smart property, colored coins, and non-hosted, non-custodial wallets.\n\nDax Hansen, chair of the chamber’s state working group and a partner at Perkins Coie LLP, said centralized cryptocurrencies pose a challenge to regulators and law enforcement officials in determining how to integrate them into the existing legal fabric. “North Carolina should be commended for investing the requisite time to understand decentralized cryptocurrencies and thoughtfully addressing them in the updated Money Transmission Act,” he said.\n\nThe chamber believes North Carolina took a business friendly approach that encourages companies to use blockchain technology and virtual currency, an approach that will bring technology companies back to the state. The North Carolina action contrasts with New York State’s separate licensing regime. As such, it provides a good direction for other states that are considering regulations.\n\nChamber Worked With Stakeholders\n\nPerianne Boring, the chamber’s founder and president, noted it’s been a long process to secure the law, but it benefits both consumers and businesses in the state.\n\n“North Carolina anticipated key issues, and developed a reasonable solution to address each concern,” Boring said. “This has paved the way for other states to realize and embrace the incredible potential of these technologies.”\n\nThe chamber is working with several other states, the Conference of State Supervisors and the Uniform Law Commission, in developing approaches to blockchain technology and virtual currencies.\n\nAlso read: Blockchain Industry advocates weigh in on North Carolina regulatory bill\n\nGuidance For Other States\n\nCarla L. Reyes, a Bruce R. Jacobs Visiting Assistant Professor of Law at Stetson University College of Law, said North Carolina’s action is important since it demonstrates a commitment to understanding emerging technology and providing activity-based, thoughtful regulation of business models using such technologies.\n\n“Such careful consideration of the issues and the technology by regulators and legislatures is important for protecting the dual public policy interests of industry innovation and consumer protection,” Reyes said.\n\nThe state’s Money Transmissions Act was one of the chamber’s state working group’s key initiatives. The working group includes more than 20 member companies and six law firms.\n\nThe chamber noted the contributions of Amy Kim of Buckley Sandler, Carla Reyes of Stetson University College of Law, Joseph Cutler of Perkins Coie, Dax Hansen of Perkins Coie (chair of the state working group), Arika Pierce of Gide, and Dan Spuller of Cryptolina.\n\n“We applaud the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks for their thoughtful engagement and approach towards making this bill a reality,” Boring said.\n\nImage from Shutterstock and the North Carolina Governor’s office.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin exchange and platform Coinbase has announced new investment and partnership with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BMTU), Japan’s biggest bank. The endeavor will see Coinbase look toward expansion efforts in Japan and Asia.\n\nBitcoin exchange and services platform Coinbase will raise $10.5 million from Japanese investors today with the aim to launch services in Japan. Currently, Coinbase only has an Asian presence in Singapore.\n\nInvestors include the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BMTU) Japan’s largest lender and bank, respectively. The latter is a subsidiary of MUFG. Investors will also include Mitsubishi UFJ Capital (MUCAP), the banking corporation’s venture-capital fund and Sozo Ventures, a California-based venture capital firm that is also established in Japan.\n\nIn a statement, Coinbase said via its blog:\n\nPartnering with leading global financial institutions is a key part of our strategy and we are thrilled to be working with BTMU.\n\nBeyond its new investment in the cryptocurrency industry, MUFJ has notably shown its interest in digital currencies in the past. Earlier this year, reports revealed that MUFG had begun a trial for its own virtual currency, rumored to be called MUFG coin. It was later rumored that MUFG was also developing a two-way ATM machine for MUFG coin and the Japanese yen, due for a launch in spring 2018.\n\nThe trial was then confirmed by the bank itself, and the bank-issued digital currency is expected to see a launch in autumn 2017.\n\nFurthermore, Coinbase added that it is continuing its international expansion, with its new partnership with BTMU aiding its effort to focus on the Japanese market.\n\nCoinbase has previously raised $75 million in a Series C financing round which saw the likes of the New York Stock Exchange, military-centric financial services company USAA and the investment arm of Spanish banking group BBVA.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As of July 29, Coinbase will no longer be servicing its Canadian customers, informing them that they must change their existing CAD balances to Bitcoin or have it relocated to their bank account.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company, who is a leading Bitcoin exchange, sent out an email to its customers informing them of the upcoming changes. It will further add to the woes of Canadians who haven’t had a great year when it comes to Bitcoin exchanges offering them services.\n\nCoinbase stated in an email that:\n\nAs of August 1, Coinbase’s Canadian payments provider, Vogogo, will be shutting down its payment processing business. When this occurs, Coinbase will no longer be able to support Canadian EFT transfers, Interac transfers, or the storage of customer CAD on Coinbase.\n\nIt further stated that all Canadian dollars stored with Coinbase must be withdrawn off-site or converted to cryptocurrency by July 29 with customers facing heavy fees if they are unable to do so.\n\nCalgary-based online payments service provider, Vogogo announced on July 5 that it was terminating its payments service after the completion of its risk management business was sold. It was only in 2014, that the company has raised $8.5 million to improve Bitcoin exchange security before going live.\n\nWith Coinbase’s expansion to Canada taking place less than a year ago, this is likely to cause an effect within the cryptocurrency industry as Kraken is another exchange that also uses the service.\n\nThis news, however, comes in light of Coinbase announcing that they received a $10.4 million investment from the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU), the bank’s Mitsubishi UFJ Capital unit and Sozo Ventures, despite the fact that it doesn’t, as yet, offer exchange services in Japan.\n\nHowever, while the company said that it doesn’t offer a cryptocurrency exchange service in Japan they are committed to continuing their international expansion and look forward to working with BTMU.\n\nThe Coinbase blog said:\n\nPartnering with leading global financial institutions is a key part of our strategy and we are thrilled to be working with BTMU.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin prices experienced moderate volatility during the week ending 8th July as market participants took action ahead of the upcoming halving of bitcoin rewards, scheduled to happen on or around 9th July.\n\nAs the decline in new bitcoins minted daily is programmed into the network, the broader bitcoin community has known about this event for years, and many are eagerly watching or even wagering on the outcome. Perhaps because of this, market momentum coming into the week was high.\n\nAfter opening at $672.48 on 1st July, bitcoin prices quickly surpassed $700, breaching this level on 2nd July and reaching a weekly high of $704.42 at 12:00 UTC on 3rd July, according to CoinDesk’s USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nThis rally represented ""a natural market response as eager buyers saw an opportunity to buy bitcoin on the cheap before the halving,"" explained Peter Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub.\n\nThis situation ""fueled massively bullish market sentiment,"" a statement which he backed up using Whaleclub data. According to these figures, total position volume was 92% and 88% long on 1st and 2nd July, respectively.\n\nIn spite of this strong sentiment, bitcoin failed to stay above $700 for long, plunging to a low of $648.05 at 16:45 UTC on 3rd July, additional BPI data reveals.\n\nThe digital currency was unable to stay at $700 because once it reached this level, ""sellers come out of the woodwork"" to find buyers, according to investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham.\n\nZivkovski provided similar insight into the digital currency’s decline, stating that its price ""failed to make new highs above $700 despite multiple attempts,"" a development that he said drove prices down and cleared ""weakly held and over leveraged longs.""\n\nMarket correction\n\nThe digital currency managed to recover from this sharp decline, rising to a high of $679.92 at 01:45 UTC on 7th July, before plunging roughly 10% to a low of $611.26 by 21:30 UTC that same day.\n\nWhen explaining this sharp decline, market experts spoke to both uncertainty and profit taking ahead of the halving. For example, Lingham emphasized that there are a great deal of unknowns surrounding this event, and that ""no one really knows what the implications are going to be.""\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin leverage trading platform BitMEX, stated that amid this uncertainty, many market participants are choosing to take profits instead of leaving their bitcoin at risk.\n\nZivkovski told CoinDesk that leading up to the correction, Whaleclub registered a long-short ratio of 22-to-1, its highest on record, meaning that with all these bullish positions up, there was no buying power left.\n\n""No new money entered the system, and following a few days of low volume and failure to reach new highs, low entry buyers triggered a large sell off by taking profit,"" he stated.\n\nEther weakness\n\nWhile the halving event has been generating substantial visibility, ether, the digital currency of platform ethereum, has been experiencing its own major events.\n\nEther prices repeatedly fell below $10 during the week, a sharp contrast to the all-time high of $21 the digital currency reached in mid-June, Poloniex figures reveal. In addition, the digital currency declined 18.5% week-over-week.\n\nEther has been suffering this consistent weakness as the ether community debated whether to implement a hard fork in a bid to bail out investors of the failed distributed organization The DAO.\n\nSince this problem appeared in June, the ether community has been considering how to address the situation. Originally, many advocated a soft fork to solve the problem, but it has been since revealed that harnessing this approach would leave The DAO open to further attacks.\n\nNow, many members of the Ethereum community are pushing for developers to implement a hard fork for The DAO, which would effectively kill the distributed organization. The situation will likely be a source of continued volatility in the coming weeks as the community seeks a conclusion.\n\nCharles L.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', ""Since the early days of the internet, there has been a constant movement of people, from mailing boards to Facebook and Reddit. Eternal September keeps chasing out the best who are then followed by the rest with the process now repeating.\n\nAlthough Facebook is one of the biggest companies on earth, few think it is cool – your mom is on it. Meanwhile, Reddit, itself a product of an exodus from Digg, has brought to the forefront a serious problem, private sector censorship of free speech.\n\nThe duo of Daniel Larimer and Ned Scott, the former a techy, the latter from the world of finance, think they have a solution, Steemit. The blockchain-powered platform is a mixture between medium and reddit where users are paid for voting and posting in a new currency called steem, currently valued at around $0.23 per unit. Steemit users just received the first payout, $1.3 million in total, but can this really work?\n\nThe incentives of steemit’s design\n\nThere has been much debate on the use of money to incentivise intrinsic behaviour, such as studying, donations, or healthy activity. The jury is still out with one study concluding that the effects of monetary incentivization on intrinsically motivated behaviour, basically, depends:\n\n“A considerable and growing body of evidence suggests that the effects of incentives depend on how they are designed, the form in which they are given (especially monetary or nonmonetary), how they interact with intrinsic motivations and social motivations, and what happens after they are withdrawn. Incentives do matter, but in various and sometimes unexpected ways.”\n\nThe incentives of streemit’s design were described by Larimer, speaking to CoinTelegraph In eight points:\n\nNo transaction fees. Mandatory spending. Liquidity rewards to bootstrap market trading. Everyone who provides value should get a stake. Don't ask for money, ask for time and energy. Build value for people who don't buy in or use the platform (readers). Natural marketing and SEO through producing content. Make it fun.\n\nMuch of it is self-descriptive, but we asked for an explanation on “mandatory spending”.\n\nLarimer says:\n\n“Under Steem, it doesn't matter if you vote or not, funds will be distributed to someone. This forces people to focus on directing funds to the best cause, rather than \u200b*if*\u200b they should fund something. The result of mandatory spending is that the platform gradually changes hands from those who do nothing to those who contribute.”\n\nDistributing the funds\n\nThe monetary aspects of the platform are somewhat complex. First of all, it all runs and is stored on a blockchain, so it has miners. Second, it uses a mixture of proof of work mining, proof of stake and delegated proof of stake. To make it a bit more fun, it has three currencies.\n\nThe “core” currency is Steem, which is highly inflationary with steem units doubling every year. Many, therefore, convert it to Steem Power (SP) which locks the currency in a stake for two years. Then there is Steem Dollars which aims to be pegged to the US Dollar.\n\nThere is an even more complex method of distributing the funds which constantly inflate. 90% of the inflated funds are given to SP holders, the other 10% is shared:\n\n“The accounting is complex, but fundamentally this is no different than Bitcoin. Bitcoin has allocated 10% of its market cap each year to pay for miners. Steem allocates 10% of its market cap to pay for curation (voters), posting, mining, block production, and liquidity.”\n\nThe 10% is allocated to four groups, “1% block producers, 1% liquidity, 6% authors and 2% curators,” according to Larimer’s estimate. There is no halving, so the currency continues to inflate at 10%, effectively, indefinitely.\n\n“It has really gained traction. New users are signing up every day. There is a constantly growing number of active users,” says Larimer with more than 700 active users yesterday and 20,000 pageviews a day.\n\nReddit’s heavy censorship vs. steem’s censorship resistance\n\nOne attraction, especially in light of reddit’s heavy censorship by both admins and moderators may be steem’s censorship resistance. As all is stored on a blockchain, unless 51% of node operators, miners and stakeholders agree, no content can be removed. That, of course, has two edges.\n\nAfter a terrorist shooting in Orlando, heavy censorship was implemented by reddit moderators, especially r/news which went so far as to remove a post giving information on blood donations. This brought the bubbling reddit censorship issue to mainstream attention, but only for just a day with no action taken.\n\nReddit admins have taken a position that moderators can do whatever they wish in their own subreddits. The problem is of course that name domains are hot property as r/news retains a structural advantage over r/news2 due to most newcomers typing the former.\n\nThat opens our great public spaces where we congregate to insidious overt and covert manipulation which may provide entities with powerful political or financial advantage at, perhaps, the expense of the common good.\n\nMany, therefore, think that reddit is ripe for disruption as new space seems to have opened to figure out a more equitable way of organizing our public discussions.\n\nIs steemit the solution?\n\nWhether steemit is the solution is not clear. The way it is currently organized seems to be limited to self-posts, rather than direct link sharing from the title. Moreover, the administrators of the website can, if they wish, remove content or comments, but they would remain on the blockchain and anyone can set up a website to reflect the blockchain just as there are a number of block explorers.\n\nThis may be one way to address the other edge of free speech. Content that is fundamentally in breach of all or almost all values, although it may be on the backbone, stored on the blockchain, would not be displayed on the frontend.\n\nNedd Scott, CEO and Co-founder at Steemit, described his ambitions to CT as follows:\n\n“Our goal is to give [social media] back to the people by making it a public resource and a utility owned by the people. Ultimately the people who have say over Steem are the token holders and that’s what will drive its direction in the long run.”\n\nFrom the voting algorithm to funding distribution, token market price, monetary incitivization, the use of the blockchain itself, there are many complex interactions, combining an instant market reaction through price, financial carrots and sticks through voting, as well as monetary reward for product creation together with a digital currency element.\n\nWhether this will work in its current incarnation remains to be seen, but it is one of the more unique attempts to try and solve the decades long social media problem with the results of the experiment, whether failure or success, undoubtedly closely watched by many."", 'In a historical, decentralized and defining decision, Ethereum holders have unanimously voted in favor of a hardfork to deprive the DAO thief of his ill gains and return the funds to token holders, avoiding a trainwreck just months after ethereum’s release.\n\nUtilizing the blockchain, a transparent and non-gameable voting method shows that out of more than 1.5 million eth, 97%, valued currently at $15 million, are in favor of the fork, with only just above 40,000 eth against.\n\nThe unanimous and conclusive decision by ethereum’s community will now turn attention to the implementation of the hardfork which has numerous deadlines, but the latest indications are that it needs to be activated by the 21st of July, just under two weeks. After that date, the situation becomes far more complex.\n\nAccording to a public statement, the details are still being discussed with numerous proposals on the table. However, Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, stated that he prefers a proposal which ignores the innocent childDAO ether withdrawals that have been initiated prior to the attack through a split, allows token holders to donate their share of the ExtraBalance to “something”, including themselves, and solves “everything now, without any delay.”\n\nWith the community now having conclusively decided that they are to fork, all eyes are on the code. The best indication we were given of when it may be merged was “soon”. Nick Johnson, Software Engineer at Ethereum Foundation stated that developers are busy working on the code as shown by numerous open pull requests related to the hardfork, before adding that “if it seems slow, it’s because we want to be absolutely certain we get it right.” Responding to our question on whether the coding changes were complex, Johnson stated:\n\n“The actual change is fairly trivial – a balance transfer between blocks. All the code around that in order to prevent Bad Things happening adds a lot of complexity. Not to mention very thorough testing. For instance, making sure that any nodes that fast sync after the fork, sync to the correct chain.”\n\nPéter Szilágyi, Software Developer at Ethereum Foundation and one of the main developers of the hardfork code, told CCN:\n\n“The consensus logic of the hard fork isn’t too complicated, but networking aspects very much are, which as of now no other client really cared about. Geth has both fast sync and introducing light sync which requires a lot more effort on the networking part to make sure the network partitions cleanly between forkers and non-forkers.\n\n“The soft-fork almost blew the network up because we rushed it and didn’t consider all aspects, I don’t want to make that mistake again. We’re evolving the code slowly, properly covering all possible issues we can imagine with various tests, among other end-to-end network simulations.”\n\nNow that the community has mandated the fork, the code may move faster. Szilágyi states that it can hopefully be implemented in just under two weeks, but whether that will actually be the case remains to be seen. Miners upgraded within hours for the failed softfork and downgraded just as quickly. Businesses too are likely to quickly upgrade, but the 3,500 nodes would probably require at least three or four days.\n\nHowever, a non-upgraded node would simply be ignored and node operators would probably receive loud red warnings to not use the software and to upgrade immediately. Therefore, with consensus now fully achieved, the July 21st deadline can be met, but whether that will actually be the case is not yet fully clear.\n\nIf all goes smoothly, Ethereum may show to the world that it contains safeguards when things go wrong. The first safeguard was the smart contract’s lock in period which trapped the funds and the thief, giving the ecosystem the option to revert the theft. If this was a transaction based hack in bitcoin or ethereum, the funds would have long since dispersed in tens of thousands of addresses, making any enforcement action impossible. As counterintuitive as it is, therefore, this may show that smart contracts are actually safer.\n\nThe second safeguard is the community itself which has shown to the world that they treat ethereum as a technology, rather than as an ideological tool, and are therefore willing to intervene in unison when the circumstances are sufficiently exceptional and highly beneficial to the ecosystem and its people. Making ethereum and its community fundamentally different from Bitcoin.\n\nWhat may, therefore, have been a disaster, may turn out to be a blessing as Ethereum proves itself to be the safest platform where tens of millions are not just burned. Although this event is unlikely to be forgotten as there are many lessons to be learned, unlike hacks of other platforms, it will probably be remembered as a disaster averted, rather than as a tragedy, with everyone from developers, investors, and users standing up to successfully address ethereum’s biggest challenge.\n\nWith the hardfork now a foregone conclusion, the community is already beginning to move on. Chronicled just recently announced they have chosen Ethereum to secure high-end sneakers. Devcon2 has just been announced, with Microsoft re-stating their commitment as premier sponsors. Mist browser has just been released.

One required question sought to address whether member firms are engaged in business activities involving virtual currencies, while the other aimed to assess the nature of activities.\n\nThe questionnaire provides a number of possible answers for respondents including whether they issue virtual currencies or are affiliated with entities that trade or invest in the area, providing insight into how FINRA believes its members may be engaging with the emerging technology.\n\nIn statements to CoinDesk, FINRA sought to position the inquiry as just a small part of a larger examination process, one whose results would not be released more widely.\n\nThe organization said:\n\n""The information collected through the RCA is used for regulatory and examination purposes only.""\n\nElsewhere, Pillsbury Winthrop attorney Marco Santori said he believes FINRA may be seeking to learn more about its members virtual currency activities due to complexities relating to the how broker-dealers are regulated in the US.\n\nMore specifically, he posited that the reason for the questions may be that entities regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are exempt from Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and state licensing requirements, agencies which have been more assertive in attempting to understand and regulate the industry.\n\nImage credit: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The University College London’s blockchain research center has found that bitcoin\'s current proof-of-work (PoW) mining costs are necessary to maintain the network\'s trustless and decentralized nature.\n\nIn a recent research note, Tomaso Aste, a professor of complexity sciences and director of the UCL\'s Centre for Blockchain Technologies, offers a rough measure for calculating the ""equilibrium fair cost"" of bitcoin’s PoW system, suggesting that this fair cost per block is roughly $10,000 – less than the current amount earned by discovering a block today.\n\nThe findings are notable given the longstanding debate over bitcoin\'s use of mining for transaction verification, one that has often found institutions and academics deeming the process either excessively wasteful or an unnecessary component of the system\'s architecture.\n\nStill, in the note, Aste calls the amount of money spent per block justified when observed through the lens of maintaining a distributed transaction network.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n""I conclude that the current cost, although large, is of a justified order of magnitude for an anonymous systems[sic] operating between untrustful parties.""\n\nAt current bitcoin prices, a block reward of 25 BTC nets miners or the distributed members of mining pools roughly $15,600. An upcoming block reward halving, scheduled for this weekend, will see the subsidy fall to 12.5 BTC.\n\nAssessing cost\n\nBitcoin mining has been compared in the past to a form of energy arbitrage, by which mine operators profit by generating more money than they spend on electricity. The cheaper your power – and the bigger your mine – the more bitcoins you can attempt to generate.\n\nAste estimates that as much as $50,000 is expended on electricity per hour by the world’s bitcoin miners.\n\nUsing a standard a transaction block roughly every 10 minutes (which, in practice, can fluctuate significantly), Aste suggests that it costs about $8,333 in power per block. This amount will fall by half imminently, he writes, ""leaving very small margins for profit accordingly with the above estimations"".\n\n""The overall mining electricity bill for a year of bitcoin mining sum up to over $400m which is a large amount and, somehow, a big waste,"" Aste writes, going on to say:\n\n""On the other hand, proof of work is the mechanism that keeps the blockchain pure making an entire community competing to verify validity of transactions and making attacks costly. The question I address in this note is whether this cost is justified.""\n\nAttack scenario\n\nAste arrives at the estimate for the fair cost of proof-of-work by envisioning a double-spend attack, using a transaction block with a value of about $1m as an example.\n\nHe notes that in order to ensure a successful double-spend, the attacker would need to somehow guarantee that their transactions are confirmed at least six times on the network.\n\nAccounting for the fact that a double-spend would likely go unnoticed – ""it is quite unrealistic to assume that nobody notices the propagating fork for such a long time,"" he writes – Aste posits that the equilibrium fair cost of bitcoin’s proof of work is equal to the duplicated fraction of a block’s value divided by the number of blocks required to settle, in this case six.\n\n""With the current values, and to make calculations clean, we can assume that the attacker duplicates 60% of the typical value of a block, double spending therefore $600,000,"" Aste writes. “Requiring six blocks for settlement this yields to the following estimate for what should be the fair cost of the proof of work per block at equilibrium….$100,000.""\n\nAste goes on to write that the actual fair cost, accounting for the notion that a double-spend would be spotted early on and that most double-spends would likely be attempted on a smaller scale, is likely 10% of that rough estimate.\n\n""This is indeed the order of magnitude of the present electricity cost for the proof of work in bitcoin,"" Aste notes, going on to conclude:\n\n""We can therefore conclude that the current cost for bitcoin proof of work is large, wasteful, but necessary.""\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Two dollars to the pound. Amazing. I brought a lot of American stuff that year. Yesterday, I bought something and it was $1.30 to the pound. Shoot. The dinner for $100 that a few years ago would have cost me £50 was now £72. Ouch! I’ve seen this a lot over the years in my travels. Australia used to be cheap. It’s now expensive. Europe used to be expensive and then became cheap, but it’s getting more expensive again since we voted to Brexit.\n\nCurrency fluctuations are something that batter everyone, based upon the stability of their economies. My South African friends used to get a decent rate to the Rand until President Zuma messed up the country. As for Zimbabwe, well. Zimbabwe now trades mobile minutes as currency along with US dollars, ever since the national currency went into meltdown. Right now, Venezuela looks like it’s doing a Zimbabwe.\n\nImage from Zero Hedge\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nWell, many of us look at dollars, euros, pounds, yen, yuan as being of great value. But they’re not. These currencies are all useless. They’re just fictions. They are made up by governments to be of value and, because we believe in governments, they work. As long as the government works, the currency works. The Zimbabwe Dollar and the Venezuelan Bolivar are only imploding because their governments stopped working effectively. Other countries stopped believing in their governments’ abilities to run the country, and their currencies imploded.\n\nThis is what feels very close to home at the moment. Our country voted to #Brexit, and the guys leading the campaign to Leave all left. The left the rest of the people with no plan. With no plan, there is no confidence and with no confidence the currency implodes.\n\nImage from ExchangeRate.org\n\nWhat happens when money stops working? We find alternatives to trade. Gold, oil, mobile minutes, comic books, beads, food. Anything that has a value that is stable when currencies are unstable.\n\nIn many markets, when currency stops working, people are now also turning to bitcoin. We saw this in Crete when the central bank seized citizens’ savings and others are thinking, like me, that the Brexit vote could be a gift to bitcoin.\n\nIt won’t be of course, because bitcoin has too many faults – lack of scalability, cost of processing, trust in structure, challenge of acceptance, understanding of consumers and so on – but it may be the prototype for something far more acceptable in the future. A little bit like the internet before Tim Berners-Lee, bitcoin sits in its own technical basket of geekiness that is waiting for someone, anyone, to break through. Maybe it will be Circle or maybe it will be Ethereum – oh no, the DAO hack – and I’m pretty sure there will be a breakthrough in the future whereby some cryptocurrency becomes a standardised internet exchange of value.\n\nThis is the dystopian vision of Lionel Shriver, author and visionary, in her new book The Mandibles, 2029-2047. The book is a fairly depressing vision of the future in which the American Empire is on the skids, US government debt is astronomical, the dollar is in free fall and being battered by a newly-created international reserve currency, the bancor. In response, the US government confiscates all the gold in the country, and American citizens are forbidden to take more than $100 out of the US.\n\nLikely? Probably not at the moment, looking at what China is doing, but the book intrigued me for the idea of the bancor, the envisaged currency of the future. The bancor is a cryptocurrency based upon a basket of fiat currencies.\n\nAs The New Yorker describes it, America’s economic collapse is “set in motion by the introduction of the bancor, a new global reserve currency meant to replace the dollar on the international market and backed by a coalition of countries led by Russia’s ruler-for-life, Vladimir Putin. Furious, President Alvarado, America’s first Mexican-born head of state, announces that the U.S. will default on its loans. The Fed goes into overdrive, printing new money to cover its debts. In short order, a greenback is as worthless as a Weimar cigarette rolled with a fifty-billion-mark note. Hard-earned savings go up in smoke. A meagre cabbage costs thirty dollars one week, forty the next, and that’s when there’s still cabbage to buy. So long, superpower nation. Hello, hyperinflation.”\n\nFor me, the bancor is bitcoin 4.0. A design upon a design that gradually makes the faults of bitcoin 1.0 to be wrinkled away until we do have a trusted digital currency. Bearing in mind what’s happening in Venezuela and Britain right now, maybe that wouldn’t be such a bad thing.']"
07/09/2016,"['Ethereum has increasingly become a problem for the Internet\'s millions of Bitcoin faithful. It goes against Bitcoin maximalist dogma, for one thing: if the 21 million eventual total Bitcoins in the world are the only genuine, useful, well-supported cryptocurrency... and if everything else is imitative, manipulated, or ""centralized"" junk... then what is this thing Ether, and why are all the Ethers in the Ethereum collectively valued at US $894,488,591 today, even hours after Bitcoin\'s block halving went off without a hitch. And why is Charlie Lee\'s Litecoin worth US $194,392,405? It\'s not Bitcoin! Yet it has a big value, and some users, what is going on here, the Bitcoin maximalist asks.\n\nTo answer these questions, and gain some insight into whether Bitcoin, Ethereum, or something else altogether might eventually dominate this space, we\'ll turn to Satoshi Nakamoto\'s own words.\n\nNakamoto, of course, is the shadowy pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, who released the currency as open source software to the world. Bitcoin became operational in early January 2009. He hasn\'t been officially heard from in any capacity since sometime in 2010.\n\nAs Satoshi Nakamoto posted back in August 2010, his last year of communication with the public, cryptocurrency can be looked at through the following lens: ""As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:\n\n- boring grey in colour\n\n- not a good conductor of electricity\n\n- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either\n\n- not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose\n\nand one special, magical property:\n\n- can be transported over a communications channel\n\nIf it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.\n\nMaybe it could get an initial value circularly as you\'ve suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.""\n\nMany of Satoshi\'s public comments and explanations have a strange prescience to them: he called, more or less, exactly what has happened to the economic value of Bitcoin since he disappeared. It has established some value to collectors and speculators, but it\'s also used to transfer wealth over vast distances - a Chinese user can pay a US or European merchant with total ease, in a way that\'s not possible with leading legacy financial systems or fiat currencies.\n\nNow let\'s think about newer competitors since Satoshi went silent back in 2010. Six years is a long time in the evolution of any technological product, but especially computer hardware or software. I don\'t have the same laptop or desktop I had in 2010, so does it make sense for the whole world to be using the same cryptocurrency that was experimented with by a relative handful of people in 2010?\n\nEspecially after today\'s apparently successful block halving, I think Bitcoin has proven itself a worthy veteran. It is, after all, the original cryptocurrency.\n\nAnd even with its now ""slow"" 10 minute block time (Ethereum has an average block time of around 15 seconds; Litecoin has a 2.5 minute block time), Bitcoin has a track record of liquidity, geographical distribution, merchant acceptance, & network uptime that no other cryptocurrency yet comes close to matching.\n\nWith that said... when you look at the original alchemist Satoshi\'s own words, there is a loophole: what if another dull, instantly transportable crypto token were to emerge and become popular around the world, for whatever initial reason? And what if that token were the same as the other, with two distinct differences:\n\n- useful for a broad practical or ornamental purpose (the execution & maintenance of apps/smart contracts on a decentralized virtual machine)\n\n- mined in a manner that made users feel the currency was less ""rare"", leading to faster experimentation rates and economic uses of the token, whatever those uses may be\n\nEspecially if that token were to gain a similar acceptance footprint over time (Ether is now accepted on Coinbase\'s exchange, to continue the thought experiment - and it is believed by some that Litecoin will eventually be added to Coinbase\'s exchange offering as well)... if that were to happen, well then shucks... even though Satoshi Nakamoto is no longer replying to curious researchers, I think he (or she) would have to agree with me: when all those conditions are adequately met, a proper competitor or two Bitcoin might have.\n\nIf you enjoy my cryptocurrency commentary, be sure to add yourself to the newsletter.

Some users complain about the exchange’s too strict compliance.\n\nMUFG senior manager Yuichiro Kawasaki cited the reasons behind Coinbase’s ‘strong compliance systems was to prevent wrongdoing. Another factor in play has been the Coinbase’s licenses to offer money transmission services in many U.S. states.\n\nAs a part of the compliance procedures, now the exchange asks users if they are sending their coins to another exchange. “When sending money to external accounts, it says in its FAQ, “we are required to gather a bit of information before processing the transaction. Coinbase is federally registered as a Money Service Business (MSB). In order to comply with federal regulations, we must know if money is sent from a Coinbase account to a financial institution, in this case a bitcoin service or exchange.”\n\nImproving Bitcoin’s image in Japan\n\nSince Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, filed for bankruptcy in 2014 with customers losing Bitcoins worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the image of Bitcoin has been soiled in Japan.\n\nThis is likely to change now as BTMU, a subsidiary of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), which has been conducting experiments on its digital currency, utilizing the technology behind the virtual currency Bitcoin and will be supporting Coinbase’s expansion focus in key markets in Asia and globally.\n\nIn Asia, prior to their partnership with BTMU, Coinbase had been operating only in Singapore. According to bank officials, Coinbase is set to raise about $10.5 million from investors, including MUFG’s core banking unit and an MUFG venture-capital fund. The fund will expand its operations beyond its current 32 countries.\n\nCoinbase wrote on its website:\n\n“At Coinbase, our mission is to create an open financial system for the world by building the bridge between financial institutions and the new world of digital finance. Partnering with leading global financial institutions is a key part of our strategy and we are thrilled to be working with BTMU. While we do not yet offer digital currency exchange services in Japan, we are committed to continued international expansion and look forward to working with BTMU to support this focus in key markets in Asia and globally.”\n\nRelatedly, Coinbase has informed its users that its Canadian payments provider, Vogogo, will be shutting down its payment processing business by August 1. This means that when it happens, Coinbase will no longer be able to support Canadian EFT transfers, Interac transfers, or the storage of customer CAD on its platform.', 'The Bitcoin stolen from cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift has begun to move.\n\nIn March of 2016, a hacker, aided by a rogue employee, stole more than $230,000 worth of cryptocurrency from ShapeShift. Most of it has not been recovered, and the perpetrator has not yet been identified.\n\nErik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeShift, kept the general public appraised as to the situation during and after the hacking incident.\n\nMixing transactions so as to confuse traceability\n\nOn June 30th, the stolen funds were moved to two separate addresses, one in a $205,666 chunk and the other in a $654 chunk. Each one of these addresses shows only two transactions: the receipt of the funds, and the subsequent transmission of those funds to two separate addresses. This continues on seemingly endlessly, as each new transaction is separated into two and sent to two new, empty addresses so as to cover the thief’s tracks.\n\nAll Bitcoin transactions are publicly viewable via the blockchain. However, since addresses are not tied to any specific identity, and new ones may be created easily, the obfuscation of financial transfers becomes very doable. Coin mixing services send coins to and from many addresses so that their final destination, and origin, remains unclear, thereby maintaining privacy. Dash has a coin mixing service built in, performed by its masternodes.\n\nShapeShift has since moved on\n\nSince the attack, ShapeShift has pledged to rebuild and recover. No customer funds were stolen during the hacks, and ShapeShift’s infrastructure has since been rebuilt.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Although it can be classified as part of the FOREX market (the decentralized market for trading currencies), it is fundamentally different to other the other currencies. For example, it is not the domestic currency of any Country.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is Less Controlled & Regulated Than Conventional Currencies\n\nAs Bitcoin is not minted by a central bank, & it isn’t specific to any one nation, it is free (to some extent) from manipulation. For example, the US Dollar (CURRENCY:USD) can be affected by the Federal Reserve’s Monetary policy (i.e. interest rates.) To be more specific, a decrease in interest rates would cause the value of the Dollar to decrease.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here\n\nBitcoin is free from this sort of state intervention.

The article read “From late this May to just a few days prior to the UK’s referendum on European Union (EU) membership, the price had surged almost $300. As of July 7 it was trading at around $648 – up 63% from the price this time last year at $397.”\n\nBitcoin’s volatility means that investors can generate large returns.

O detalhe é que a medida está prevista há sete anos.\n\nCotado a US$ 652 a unidade na última sexta-feira (8), o bitcoin já movimenta um mercado de US$ 10,2 bilhões.\n\nSem bancos como intermediários e não regulamentada por autoridades financeiras, a moeda só existe no ambiente virtual. A forma como ela funciona está em linhas de código de computador e não sobre o controle de algum órgão monetário estatal. Os valores são transferidos entre ""carteiras"", que existem nos computadores dos usuários.\n\nMoeda \'física\' que brinca com o Bitcoin (Foto:\n\nReuters)\n\nTransações públicas\n\nTodas as transações com bitcoin são registradas em um sistema aberto ao público –é possível até conferir quem mandou que quantia para quem, desde que você saiba o código da carteira dos dois. Essas operações são reunidas em blocos, depois incorporadas a uma corrente –é essa sequência de transferências que pode ser acessada.\n\nSó que essas engrenagens não funcionam sem os chamados “mineradores”, máquinas com grande poder computacional. São elas quem solucionam as operações criptográficas necessárias para quem uma transferência seja registrada.\n\nRecompensa menor\n\nO esforço delas em garantir o vai e vém de bitcoins é remunerado com uma emissão de novas moedas todas as vezes que um novo bloco é incorporado à corrente. É essa “recompensa” que passa a ser menor –antes, em 25 bitcoins, o valor de cada nova liberação, passa a ser de 12,5 bitcoins.\n\nO gatilho para a alteração entrar em curso está no documento que descreve a moeda, de 2009, e presente no código que a faz funcionar: ocorre todas as vezes que o sistema inclui 210 mil novos blocos à corrente. Uma restrição na emissão já ocorreu uma vez, em 2012.\n\nFeito para ser escasso\n\n“Isso tem uma lógica. O protocolo do bitcoin foi desenhado a partir de algumas premissas básicas. A primeira é a questão do teto e do valor total de circulação, em 21 milhões de moedas”, explica Safiri Félix, presidente-executivo da corretora brasileira de bitcoins CoinBR.\n\nEle explica que, como surgiu na esteira da crise financeira de 2008, a moeda possui como características alguns mecanismos que evitam que a ação de membros do mercado, como bancos centrais, exerçam alguma influência sobre ela. “Se tem moeda demais circulando, o poder de compra do cidadão é prejudicada”, diz Félix. Ou seja, o bitcoin foi feito para ser escasso. Atualmente, há 15,75 milhões de moedas na praça.\n\nA comunidade em torno do meio circulante espera que a próxima restrição do tipo, que levará as recompensas a 6,25 bitcoins, ocorra em 2020. E a previsão de que a circulação atinja seu teto já tem data: 2140.\n\nAo passo que a remuneração fica menos generosa, outra forma de ganhar dinheiro alimentando o sistema do bitcoin pode ganhar força: as taxas para fazer transações. Opcionais, elas são pagas para que uma transferência seja priorizada e passe na frente de outra. Os valores são baixos, variam entre R$ 0,50 e R$ 0,80.\n\nAs transações do bitcoin ocorrem instantaneamente –o valor enviado de uma carteira é depositado na hora na carteira de destino. Só que ele só pode ser movimentado quando a transação é confirmada, ou seja, entra na “corrente de blocos”. “Esse envio é como fazer um ‘doc’ no banco. O dinheiro aparece como saldo na sua conta corrente, mas fica bloqueado até ser confirmado”, explica Félix.\n\nBroches com o símbolo do bitcoin na Alemanha (Foto: AP)', 'Wer Bitcoins als Investitionsgut betrachtet, der wird vor allem aufgrund einer geldpolitischen Eigenschaft Gefallen an der Kryptowährung finden: Bitcoins sind von Natur aus deflationär geprägt. Das bedeutet: Es wird von Zeit zu Zeit “schwerer”, an sie zu gelangen. Ist es also realistisch, dass der Bitcoin Kurs auf Dauer immer weiter steigt?\n\n“Bitcoins sind deflationär”\n\nDiese Aussage ist richtig und falsch zu gleich. Wer sagt, dass Bitcoins von Deflation geprägt sind, spielt dabei meist auf die Miningvergütung an. Denn diese ist in der Tat so geprägt, dass die Vergütung für investierte Rechenleistung von Zeit zu Zeit geringer wird. Das Block Halving bewirkt, dass die Vergütung für einen gefundenen Block halbiert wird. Wie “schwer” es ist, einen solchen Block zu finden, hängt wiederum von der Difficulty ab. Eine höhere Difficulty heißt: Die Berechnungen werden komplexer und die Wahrscheinlichkeit sinkt, einen Block zu finden. Nun muss jeder Teilnehmer des Bitcoin Minings aber zunächst in Vorleistung gehen: Er beschafft die entsprechende Hardware und zahlt Stromkosten für den Betrieb. Der logische Schluss lässt vermuten, dass somit auch der Bitcoin Kurs steigen (oder die Hardwarepreise fallen) muss, damit es weiterhin profitabel bleibt.\n\nEinfluss der Miningvergütung auf den Bitcoin Kurs\n\nWie ein Professor kürzlich in einer Studie herausgefunden hatte, liegt die faire Vergütung für einen gefundenen Block bei 10.000$. Nur, wenn die umgerechnete Vergütung in Dollar über diesem Wert liegt, lohnt es sich dauerhaft für Miner, ihre Rechenleistung in das System einzuspeisen. Wie bereits festgestellt, bezieht sich die Deflation auf das Rechenleistung-Bitcoin Verhältnis und nicht etwa auf den Geld/Bitcoin Wechselkurs in US-Dollar bzw. Euro.\n\nFazit\n\nZeitpunkte wie das Halving sind Momente, in denen die Stimmung umschlagen kann. Einerseits erwarten viele Nutzer einen starken Kursanstieg aufgrund der deflationären Effekte, andererseits könnte man meinen, der Effekt sei bereits mit eingepreist. Schließlich ist dieser Moment seit langer Zeit bekannt und Nutzer, die auf den steigenden Kurs setzen, treiben ihn schon vor dem eigentlichen Zeitpunkt des Halvings in die Höhe. Es kann ebenso passieren, dass irgendwann eine gewisse Grenze erreicht ist, die nicht mehr überschritten wird.\n\nWürde der Bitcoin Kurs längere Zeit nicht mehr steigen und ein Block Halving bevorstehen, dann würde sich auch der Gegenwert in Geldeinheiten (US-Dollar bzw. Euro) für alle Miner ungefähr halbieren. Viele Miner würden heruntergefahren. Ein Kursanstieg ist dennoch nicht garantiert.\n\nÜber Max Kops Maximilian Kops arbeitet als Analyst und Autor für BTC-ECHO und ist spezialisiert auf Fragen zur technischen Entwicklung von Blockchains als auch zu FinTech-Startups.

If you are in an incumbent bank, insurance company, pension fund or managing assets, Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business and the World is required reading. Co-authors Don and Alex Tapscott are deeply knowledgeable, based on Don Tapscott\'s Wikinomics (2006) and Macrowikinomics (2010), while Alex Tapscott is CEO of Northwest Passage Ventures, a former investment banker now advising and building blockchain companies. His 2014 report on governing digital currencies for the Global Solutions Network was published by the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.\n\nI became deeply immersed in this book in preparation for the expert workshop on Fintech for Sustainable Development of the UN Inquiry on Sustainable Finance to which Ethical Markets contributed a paper on Reforming Electronic Markets and Trading (2014). I was not surprised to see Canadian experts and market players punching above their weight as they have at the United Nations for decades. For example, we followed the development of fintech firms including IEX and supported its successful application to the SEC as now the nation\'s 13th national stock exchange. The same kind of technology-based market reforms as IEX\'s famous ""speed bump"" also are explored along with the current 1,379 fintech startups with combined funding of $33 billion now disrupting legacy finance.\n\nToday\'s list of the Fintech 100 are only the tip of the iceberg. Big incumbent banks are now rushing to buy out, partner or coopt these fintech startups they see as taking some 25% of their business in banking, payments, loans and remittances as these information platforms and cell phones simply bypass old money circuits. There are 5,000 blockchains on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) servers and banks, including Citi (NYSE:C) and Barclays (NYSE:BCS), are developing in-house capabilities and facilitating fintech startups. Regulatory bodies including the UK\'s Financial Conduct Authority are helping with their ""regulatory sandbox"" and many startups are now in the Regtech field.\n\nBlockchain Revolution surveys applications in the key area of trust, without which markets cannot operate. Chapters cover applications in finance, business models (including Airbnb (Private:AIRB), Uber (Private:UBER) along with cloud providers Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) but most still startups and pre-IPO), IoT, international remittances, art, music and culture - all disintermediating ""middlemen"" and empowering peer-to-peer relationships among individuals and small enterprises.\n\nThe most enlightening and important chapters are in part III ""Promise and Peril"" outlining the need for basic organization of a robust infrastructure for blockchain systems with ethical principles, standards and international governance - similar to that of the Internet, such as ICANN for domain names. The authors see blockchain as the next wave of global information, similar to the Internet in scope. But only if the technology design challenges are met, along with reducing the massive energy use and cooling needs of servers!

07/10/2016,"['They might be up in value, but they’re down in supply. Bitcoins, everyone’s favorite cryptocurrency, are in high demand, but they’re getting harder and harder to mine for. And that’s actually written into the code. Every four years, Reuters reports, the reward for bitcoin miners is cut in half, in a move that was originally designed to keep bitcoin inflation in check. So on Saturday, rather than 25 bitcoins being made available to miners every 10 minutes, there were just 12.5.\n\nBeing that they’re not physical pieces of currency, bitcoins are brought into circulation by people known as “miners.” These individuals run tens of thousands of computers at all hours of the day in order to process blocks of the latest bitcoin transactions, with rewards coming in the form of new bitcoins. In effect, these miners keep tabs on and validate the 225,000 bitcoin transactions that occur on a daily basis, and as a result, continuously increase the amount of currency in circulation (the current value of which is estimated to be $10 billion).\n\nBut now that there are fewer bitcoins up for grabs, competition among miners is getting tougher than ever.\n\n“The most important thing is to be the most efficient miner,” Marco Streng. the 26-year-old co-founder of German firm Genesis Mining, told Reuters. His firm runs mining farms throughout the world, including Canada, the U.S., eastern Europe, and Iceland. “When the others drop out, that means that they leave the market and give you a bigger share of the pie.”\n\nAnd that pie is definitely one that an increasing number of people want a piece of. While it may have seemed like a niche currency when it was first invented in 2008, bitcoin has now found its way into mainstream business. Indeed, both Overstock.com and Expedia accept bitcoin, as do a number of restaurants and other reputable organizations. It’s even being regulated (to some extent) by federal agencies.\n\nBut the cost of mining bitcoins is nothing to scoff at. Streng estimates that it costs around $200 in electricity to mine a single bitcoin. But that doesn’t even take into consideration the cost of machines, rent, wages, and businesses costs. And now that there are fewer bitcoins to be had, the cost will effectively double, and given that the current exchange rate for a bitcoin stands at $640, margins are slim.\n\nStill, as the cryptocurrency grows in popularity, it seems that there will always be people around willing to do the work. By 2020, when everything is cut in half again, experts say that bitcoin will have become widespread enough that this cut won’t really make a difference.', 'The British pound has become more volatile than Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has long been thought to be the world’s most unstable currency – moving from being worth $2 to $1,137 in the last five years. But that wildly volatile currency is now becoming a safe refuge when compared to the fluctuations in the pound.\n\nFor a brief period this week, Bitcoin’s 10-day historical volatility – a measure of how much its price has been changing – dropped below that of the British pound.\n\nBrexit protest: Thousands march in London\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 show all Brexit protest: Thousands march in London\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/12 A woman poses with a home-made European Union flag as Remain supporters gather on Park Lane in London to show their support for the EU in the wake of Brexit PA\n\n2/12 Remain supporters demonstrate in Parliament Square PA\n\n3/12 Tens of thousands of people gathered to protest the result of the EU referendum PA\n\n4/12 A majority of people in the capital voted to remain in the European Union Reuters\n\n5/12 Protesters chanted: “What do we want to do? Stay in the EU” PA\n\n6/12 The march follows a similar rally in Trafalgar Square that was cancelled due to heavy rain – but which tens of thousands of people turned up to anyway Reuters\n\n7/12 Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum by 52 per cent to 48 per cent Reuters\n\n8/12 But support for the Leave campaign in urban areas and among young people was significantly lower Rex features\n\n9/12 Marchers gathered at Park Lane at 11am and marched towards Parliament Square PA\n\n10/12 Some protesters held up baguettes in a display of affection for our continental neighbours PA\n\n11/12 The disparity between different parts of the country has promoted a four million signature petition calling for a second referendum and even a renewed push for Scotland to cede from the UK PA\n\n12/12 The event’s organiser, King’s College graduate Kieran MacDermott, wrote: “We can prevent Brexit by refusing to accept the referendum as the final say and take our finger off the self-destruct button"" Reuters\n\nSterling became incredibly volatile straight after the UK voted to leave the European Union on 23 June. Its value dropped sharply as soon as the results were announced, sending volatility up by more than double, and that instability has stayed high ever since.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin has enjoyed a relatively stable period in the days since the Brexit vote.\n\nThat has come at the same time as a huge number of people are looking to trade Bitcoin, apparently because it represents a safe haven when compared to the pound. Exchanges told Bitcoin that had seen volumes more than double in the wake of the EU referendum, particularly from people in the UK.\n\nBitcoin has long been regarded as one of the most unstable things to trade in the financial markets. Because of the relatively small amount of them, and the controversies and shocks that the currency has endured in its short life, it has a tendency to rise and fall dramatically by huge amounts very quickly.\n\nThe digital currency’s price was especially volatile in the run-up to and after the referendum. Its price dropped sharply the day before it was held, but began to rise again on the morning that results came in.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

As it turns out, there are nearly a dozen different methods which can be used to do so. Albeit the legality of these tricks remains doubtful, using Bitcoin is not a way to protect user privacy or anonymity by any means.\n\nContrary to what most people may want to believe, law enforcement agencies can track Bitcoin users on the deep web. Even though this pseudonymous cryptocurrency is the payment method of choice on these virtual underground marketplaces, it is not overly difficult to link transactions to real identities.\n\nBitcoin Does Not Provide Deep Web Anonymity\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has an active Bitcoin and blockchain task force. Their task is to track down criminals using Bitcoin to launder money. Although a Bitcoin transaction has zero relation to a real identity, somehow they managed to find deep web users through cryptocurrency.\n\nOne thing that will make this type of activity stand out is when large amounts of coins are being moved around. One particular investigation saw one person selling illegal goods in exchange for millions of dollars in Bitcoin. Sooner or later that type of activity will attract [unwanted] attention from law enforcement.\n\nBut just looking at Bitcoin transactions itself is not enough to make an arrest. Most deep web users leave digital breadcrumbs, even though they are extremely difficult to track. Despite all technological measures to provide anonymity, the human element is prone to making mistakes somewhere along the line.\n\nPerhaps the most common way to track down deep web users is by infiltrating the marketplaces themselves. Shutting down a marketplace, or gaining some backdoor access, can go a long way. Moreover, it would provide law enforcement with new leads to follow.\n\nAnonymity and privacy on the deep web work both ways, but also poses significant risks. It would not be the first time a law enforcement official went ‘undercover’ on such a marketplace. Buyers have no idea who the seller is, and vice versa. Sometimes, that other person may be a law enforcement agent.\n\nSource: Dark Web News\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', '(Bild: dpa, Jens Kalaene)\n\nAlle 210.000 Blöcke halbiert sich die Belohnung, die erfolgreiche Bitcoin-Miner für ihre Schürfarbeit bekommen. Seit Samstag sind es nur noch 12,5 Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoinminer erhalten ab jetzt nur noch 12,5 statt 25 Bitcoin, wenn sie einen Datenblock in das dezentrale Kassenbuch der Blockchain eintragen (aktuell rund 7315 Euro). Mit Erreichen des Blocks Nummer 420.000, eingetragen von einem Miner aus dem Pool F2Pool, halbierte sich die Belohnung am gestrigen Samstagnachmittag. Der im Protokoll der Kryptowährung verankerte Mechanismus sieht eine solche Halbierung alle 210.000 Blöcke vor.\n\nDie von manchen Beobachtern befürchteten drastischen Kursstürze oder Abfälle in der zum Mining versammelten Hashingleistung sind bislang nicht eingetreten. Der Bitcoinpreis liegt zur Stunde etwas unter 650 US-Dollar.\n\nBegrenzt auf 21 Millionen Bitcoins\n\nDer als Mining bezeichnete Prozess dient zur Verarbeitung von Transaktionen im Netzwerk des Bitcoin. Die Teilnehmer lassen ihre Rechner um die Wette einen Hashwert suchen. Wer als erstes zum Ergebnis kommt, darf einen Datenblock mit Transaktionen in die Blockchain eintragen und dafür neue Bitcoins einstreichen. Mit dieser Belohnung wird nicht nur ein Anreiz für die verausgabte Rechnerleistung gegeben – sie dient auch zur Geldschöpfung des banken- und staatenlosen Kryptogelds. Da die Geldmenge auf 21 Millionen Bitcoin begrenzt ist, muss sich die Belohnung jedoch im Laufe der Zeit reduzieren.\n\nUrsprünglich waren dies 50 Bitcoin, zwei Halbierungen sind nun bereits absolviert, die nächste auf 6,25 Bitcoin wird im Sommer 2020 erwartet. Endgültig soll schätzungsweise im Jahr 2100 Schluss mit neu geschürften Bitcoins sein; die abnehmende Belohnung aus dem System soll nach und nach durch Transaktionsgebühren von den Nutzern ersetzt werden. Derzeit sind bereits über 15 Millionen Bitcoin im Umlauf, mehr als zwei Drittel der vorgesehenen Geldmenge also schon erreicht.\n\n90 Prozent der Erzeugungskosten für Strom\n\nOb es noch mittelfristig Auswirkungen gibt, bleibt zu abzuwarten. Miner können natürlich jederzeit ihre ASIC-Hardware abschalten, wenn Stromkosten und Belohnung in keinem rentablen Verhältnis mehr stehen. ""Das wichtigste ist es, der effizienteste Miner zu sein“, erklärte Marco Streng, Mitgründer der Firma Genesis Mining, gegenüber der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters. Das Unternehmen betreibt unter anderem Mining-Anlagen im Rechenzentrumsstil in Island, Kanada und den USA. Den Erzeugungspreis pro Bitcoin gibt Streng mit 200 US-Dollar an. Generell mache Strom 90 bis 95 Prozent der Kosten aus, zitiert der Bericht Valery Vavilov, Chef des Mining-Hardware-Herstellers Bitfury, der selbst im großen Stil schürft.\n\nSollte die Hashingleistung stark absinken, dürfte es mindestens für mehrere Tage Stau bei der Verarbeitung von Transaktionen geben. Zumindest bis die nächste Anpassung erreicht ist: Im Bitcoinprotokoll ist vorgesehen, dass sich die Schwierigkeit der Mining-Berechnung rund alle 14 Tage den Veränderungen der Miningleistung angleicht. „Wenn andere das Handtuch schmeißen und den Markt verlassen, bleibt ein größeres Stück vom Kuchen für uns“, zeigte sich Streng gegenüber Reuters zuversichtlich.\n\nInsgesamt wurde die Halbierung in der Bitcoin-Community vielerorts enthusiastisch gefeiert. Viele setzen wohl darauf, dass mit abnehmender Zufuhr frischer Bitcoins die bereits bestehenden Kryptomünzen an Wert zulegen.

It is much broader than IoT and identity.""\n\nIn addition to Factom, projects like Solarity Solutions, Respect Network and Digital Bazaar have received funding to explore concepts related to proving the DHS\'s hypotheses. As such, John\'s part of the agency is not alone in supporting this exploration.\n\nAlso looking into the technology is the department\'s Silicon Valley Office, which has developed an innovation program that seeks to engage startups on homeland security challenges.\n\nManaging director Melissa Ho said that her group, in contrast to the data privacy program, is focused on improving authentication, a goal that led to its partnership with Factom.\n\n""We thought it was a novel approach,"" Ho said. ""Seeing that the company had existing commercial customers, we thought this would be a good opportunity.""\n\nOther areas of investment unrelated to blockchain, Ho said, have recently included projects focused on equipping canine units with wearables and open-sourcing aspects of the DHS\'s travel restrictions system. She used these examples as a way to showcase the broader fact-finding the agency is conducting on ideas with the private sector.\n\nDevice identity\n\nWhile both Ho and John voiced an interest in the technology and its capabilities, they each sought to stress that it remains early in the DHS\'s exploration of the technology.\n\nAs a result, they sought to indicate that the DHS is starting small with blockchain by testing hypotheses based on what has been popularized about its capabilities.\n\nIn the case of Factom, John said that blockchain could play a role in helping the DHS build an ""identity"" for machines and devices, which he framed as a way to extend the agency’s monitoring services as more devices become connected in the coming years.\n\n""The Factom piece is more along the line of these devices exist, but how do we build a picture of the identity of this device over time? The blockchain could be the catalyst that allow us to document the changes,"" he said.\n\nOther projects, he said, will be encouraged similarly, with the agency building on its year-and-a-half fact-finding by engaging more with outside stakeholders.\n\n""We discovered that in order to get to that point, there are some fundamental pieces that need to be proven out. We identified what those are and looked to put out a call for proposals,"" he said.\n\nOpen technologies\n\nYet another question discussed was whether the DHS sees any particular value in closed, permissioned blockchains or open, public blockchains given that institutions seem increasingly apt to favor experimentation with the former.\n\nNotably, John said that from the DHS’s perspective, it is ""irrelevant"" which type of blockchain technology is used, and that each is likely to be beneficial for certain purposes.\n\nIn regards to public blockchains, John outlined a scenario whereby the DHS could theoretically maintain an open-access system that stores the credentials of first responders or doctors during emergencies.\n\nIn this case, John said that DHS does not maintain that information, but that it would be beneficial if it was available in a ""decentralized ledger at the state and local level"".\n\nJohn said:\n\n""We are interested in both, but in order to get to that point, we need to know the security and privacy aspects are proven.""\n\nNext steps\n\nStill, John said the agency’s activities are not limited to investing.\n\nFor example, he mentioned that the DHS is involved in work being conducted by web standards body W3C, which is considering blockchain amid a wider bid to streamline online payments.\n\nJohn stressed that the DHS remains ""cautious"" about its interest in the technology, emphasizing that he wants his agency to study the technology in a ""rational"" manner that strives to determine fundamentals, such as security.\n\nHowever, John said the DHS will seek to engage the wider blockchain community alongside such efforts, concluding:\n\n""We’re interested in hearing from the community and getting insight into what the state of the art is and what the art of the possible.""\n\nImage credit: Mark Van Scyoc / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In his speech, Danilyuk gave his vision for Ukraine as the leading nation in blockchain technology use, showcasing it for public service management and improving government efficiency and transparency.\n\nDanilyuk also announced plans for his Ministry to use Distributed Labs’ eAuction, a blockchain platform for transparent auction management, in order to sell government assets and curtail rampant corruption in the current system.\n\n- Oleksandr Danilyuk, Finance Minister of the Ukraine\n\nBesides the immutable nature of the public asset ledger, the Finance Minister pointed out that a major advantage of the blockchain-based system is that it completely eliminates the possibility of administrative interference during bidding.\n\nDanilyuk announced that the first online auctions using the blockchain can be transferred to the state Deposit Guarantee Fund of Individuals (FGVFL), which currency manages about $450 billion UAH, or $18.1 billion USD at current rates. That is reportedly equal to two-thirds of the sum of the budget of the whole country. ""New online auctions will be fully transparent and open,” Danyluk explained.\n\n- Danilyuk\n\nAs a bonus, the Finance Minister mentioned that costs would be reduced from running the old, paperwork-based auction system. “Furthermore, the implementation and maintenance of the system does not require any financial or time resources.”\n\nHis presentation included a slideshow showing how the eAuction platform, Auction 3.0, will fit into the existing infrastructure and interface with existing government and banking systems. He revealed that even the largest banks are happy to integrate the new system.\n\nA programmer from Auction 3.0’s developer Distributed Lab, Dr. Pavel Kravchenko, recently talked to IBTimes about the Ukraine’s need for the software. ""Everybody knows that the state doesn\'t run things efficiently,” he explained. “The government has to get rid of the land it owns to pay back its debts to the IMF, which also requires the state to reduce its control of assets.\n\n- Dr. Pavel Kravachenko, Distributed Lab\n\nKravachenko said that the business community in his country is already informed about, and excited by, the project. ""We even have a billboard installed all around the capital that say the \'first in the world blockchain auction – a cure to corruption’.”\n\nThe developer believes he has even spotted some positive change happening because of the program too. One of the incumbent banks that he sees as a likely party to the corruption of the old system has already embraced Auction 3.0. ""Imagine, the biggest bank that is owned by the oligarch, actually doing this as well. They are doing a lot of open-source stuff as well as using the open auction.”\n\nA few other top names in finance and banking were speakers at the BIP001 conference. Timur Khromaev, the Head of Ukraine National Securities and Stock Market Commission spoke about the ‘status quo’ usage of blockchain in the Ukraine, and Roman Sulzhik, the Chairman of the supervisory council of Ukrainian National Depository, spoke about the many different opportunities that blockchain offers his country. Many other blockchain experts from both inside the country and from other countries had speaking slots too.\n\nLasha Antadze, co-founder of the Foundation Innovations and Development, was another speaker. The founder of the eAuction project, Antadze was perhaps the man most responsible for bringing it to the finance minister. His foundation developed the already-proven ProZorro procurement system, which Auction 3.0 is replacing. Together with his partner, David Kiziria, Antadze has been working on Auction 3.0 since the previous BIP001 conference in September 2015. Testing began in February, and it’s now up to the Finance Minister to authorize full production. There is no word yet on a target date.\n\nThe Ukraine is one a black sea-bordering countries that has had an impressive amount of Bitcoin adoption and network integration already.

There was no word of casualties or what triggered the clashes between soldiers supporting President Salva Kiir and those loyal to his first vice-president, Riek Machar. But at least 150 people were reportedly killed when the two sides fought on Friday evening near the presidential palace while both men were meeting inside. That battle followed an outbreak of fighting in another part of Juba on Thursday evening when at least five government soldiers died.  The two leaders called for peace at a joint press conference on Friday evening but their appeal appeared to have little effect.  Neighbours Kenya and Sudan were among the governments who on Sunday called on both leaders to stop the fighting. Kenya announced that regional foreign ministers and representatives of the international troika for South Sudan — the UK, US and Norway — would hold an emergency meeting on Monday on “the deteriorating situation and [to] chart the way forward”. Several international organisations, including the IMF, have evacuated staff from the country, which marked its fifth anniversary of independence on Saturday. The EU withdrew its head of delegation and the UK pulled out all but “essential staff”. Kenya Airways announced on Sunday it was suspending all flights to Juba as fighting raged near the airport. Other flight operators said their services were disrupted and one airline, Fly540, said the international airport would be closed for two days. The UN mission to South Sudan said it was “outraged by the resumption of violence”. It tweeted that Sunday\'s fighting, which was also near a military base belonging to Machar loyalists, involved “heavy ground assault weaponry”. Hundreds of terrified civilians fled to UN bases. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the fighting in the afternoon was so “fierce” its teams were “not able to work”. Mr Kiir and Mr Machar formed a transitional government of national unity in the world’s youngest nation after the latter’s return in April from two years in an exile where he had been leading his forces against Mr Kiir. However, there has been little progress since then towards creating the conditions for lasting peace and many people in Juba expect the situation to deteriorate.  James Gatdet Dak, a spokesman for Mr Machar, said the military base was attacked by Kiir loyalists using helicopter gunships and tanks. Mr Gatdet Dak said the attack was “repulsed” and three tanks and other equipment captured. However, local media quoted Michael Makuei, the information minister, as saying Machar loyalists were responsible for the “unfortunate incident” but that they had been “scattered” by troops loyal to Mr Kiir. Neither report could be corroborated. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, on Sunday condemned the ""senseless violence"". He said after Friday’s clash that the renewed fighting was “yet another illustration of the parties’ lack of serious commitment to the peace process”. He added: “[It] represents a new betrayal of the people of South Sudan, who have suffered from unfathomable atrocities since [the outbreak of the civil war in] December 2013.”  The government was meant to build a united military command and start integrating the two sides’ forces into a single army. But that has not happened and there are thousands of heavily armed soldiers in Juba who are deeply suspicious of each other.  There have been intermittent clashes between the two sides, and the dozen other armed groups in the country, since Mr Machar returned. However, the capital had been largely peaceful until last week.  Mike Brand, policy director of the US-based Jewish World Watch, which seeks to halt mass atrocities, said he feared this was “just a small example of what’s to come”, adding: “I’m surprised this didn’t happen sooner with so much hate, anger and angst in such a confined space.”  Aid agencies estimate more than one-third of the country’s 12m population is dependent on humanitarian assistance and more than 2m people have fled their homes since the war started in 2013.  The economy, which is dependent on oil, is close to collapse. Little oil is being produced and inflation is slightly less than 300 per cent.  Zlatko Gegic, the South Sudan director for aid agency Oxfam, said he was unaware of credible attempts to defuse the tension. “There are some talks in corridors but even if South Sudan had a stable government and institutions in place, recovery would still take years and we don’t have this so it’s likely going to get worse before it gets better,” he said. Young nation’s bloody history January 2011 South Sudanese vote for independence from Sudan in a referendum after decades-long struggle. July 9 2011 South Sudan declares independence.

This time, the new MegaUpload 2.0 will embrace the digital currency revolution by including Bitcoin payment option.\n\nKim Dotcom, the tech entrepreneur and the founder of ‘Internet Party‘- a political party in New Zealand – has hinted the possibility of Bitcoin payments integration in his upcoming file sharing application earlier this weekend. The announcement was made on his Twitter account which read:\n\n“I can tell you that MegaUpload and Bitcoin had s*x. There is a pregnancy and I have a feeling that the baby will be such a joy.”\n\nCurrently in its gestation period, MegaUpload 2.0 is Kim’s third attempt at creating a secure online file sharing platform. His other two successful attempts include the original MegaUpload and MEGA platforms. The original MegaUpload was launched over a decade ago and it was running a successful operation for over 6 years before it caught the attention of the US Department of Justice. In a controversial move, the authorities shut down the service, laid claim on his assets and even sought extradition to the United States, a country which he had never visited.\n\nAs a mark of defiance, Kim is expected to relaunch the service on the fifth anniversary of the raid. The new MegaUpload 2.0 is expected to go live on January 20, 2017, according to Kim. The new MegaUpload 2.0 will probably have a similar look and feel as its previous namesake, but with additional features. The inclusion of Bitcoin payments will also prove to be helpful as the conventional payment service providers may not be reliable, and can be easily pursued by the governments to not offer their services or freeze the accounts at any time.\n\nHis other file sharing service MEGA, which he sold while contesting the elections in New Zealand was also launched on the anniversary of the raid and seizure of the original MegaUpload site. MEGA was built as a secure cloud storage and file hosting service which was launched on January 19, 2013. The service claims to encrypt all the files locally before uploading them to the cloud to ensure data integrity and security.\n\nAccording to few reports, MegaUpload 2.0 is expected to offer about 100 GB of free space along with on-the-fly encryption.

Amid this backdrop, the sentiment of bitcoin traders was positive, according to market data including long-short ratios and other measures of confidence.\n\nWhile bitcoin prices climbed roughly 56% from 1st January to 1st July, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), this figure lagged behind the 63.8% increase enjoyed during the second half of 2015, and it fell far short of the 622.3% and 740.6% gains bitcoin experienced during the first and second halves of 2013, respectively.\n\nThe price fluctuations bitcoin enjoyed in the first six months of this year took place as market participants traded more than 450m BTC, according to Bitcoinity data gathered on 10th July. Chinese exchanges OKCoin and Huobi continued to dominate trading activity, as they accounted for more than 93% of all transactions.\n\nMarket sentiment was bullish during the period, as figures provided by full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub show that 66% of positions were long.\n\nPast that, confidence, meaning the percentage by which a particular day’s position sizes were larger than average, was 74% during the six-month time frame.\n\nEther rising\n\nBitcoin was not the only digital currency that enjoyed notable gains.\n\nEther, the digital asset on the ethereum platform, surged from $0.92 on 1st January to $12.42 on 30th June, a gain of roughly 1,250%, Poloniex figures reveal.\n\nThe digital currency, which has seen less adoption than bitcoin but seems to be quickly making progress, rose to an all-time high of $21.40 at 05:00 UTC on 17th June, but fell more than 50% to $10.00 by 16:00 UTC the next day.\n\nEther’s price benefited greatly near the beginning of the year with the release of Homestead, the first ""production version"" of the platform, Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin leveraged trading platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk.\n\nThe digital currency enjoyed tailwinds as a result of the ethereum development team delivering a working protocol. ""As it became clear that Homestead would actually be released, the price began rising,"" said Hayes.\n\n""Ether also benefitted from the bitcoin block size civil war during [the first half of 2016],"" he stated. ""As traders lost faith in the ability of bitcoin to evolve and function properly, they turned to ether.""\n\nBut while ether started the year strong, it ran into some challenges later on when distributed organization The DAO, its most visible project, encountered a major security breach.\n\nSince then, members of the ethereum community have been exploring different options for remedying the problem, though no solution seems to have gained a majority mindshare at this time.\n\nAdoption questions\n\nThere is evidence bitcoin is enjoying rising adoption along with its price, Joe Lee, founder of founder of derivatives trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk.\n\nIn backing up his assertion, Lee pointed to transaction volume, price stability and a growing number of users.\n\n""Our analysis shows that the rate of adoption of bitcoin is increasing,” he said. “We are seeing bitcoin\'s positive network effect increasing in strength as more people decide they want to try out digital currencies. This naturally increases the value to existing users both economically and fundamentally.""\n\nHe argued this finding can be seen in transaction volume data. While it took bitcoin a total of six years to hit the milestone of 100 million transactions, the digital currency reached 140 million transactions during the first half of 2016, Lee stated.\n\nPast that, he described rising price stability as ""a reflection of greater adoption"".\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, added further insight, emphasizing that while bitcoin was more esoteric when it first came into existence, it has been making inroads into the mainstream. The digital currency is receiving ""more and more publicity,"" he stated.\n\nStill, this sentiment is not without its challengers.\n\nTim Swanson, director of research for banking consortium R3, for example, has taken issue with the opaque nature of adoption numbers in the industry, and overall lack of visibility on key metrics.\n\nExternal influences\n\nOne development that may have fueled the rising adoption of bitcoin is concerns about yuan devaluation.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China (PBOC) sharply devalued the Chinese yuan in August 2015. This move triggered bitcoin’s breakout, said Hayes, as the central bank kept reducing the value of China’s currency over the next 10 months.\n\nBitcoin benefited from “fears of Chinese savers that their purchasing power would drastically decrease,” he stated. Hayes added that “the PBOC began closing the easy ways through which capital leaves China.”\n\nAnother variable that analysts singled out as helping push bitcoin prices higher was the Brexit, when on 23rd June, British voters approved the UK’s departure from the 28-nation European Union.\n\nWhile more than one expert has pointed to this event as affecting bitcoin prices, Enneking said that it had less of an effect than past macroeconomic events.\n\nFor instance, he indicated that events in Greece in 2015 and China in 2013 ""paled in comparison"" to price moves observed as a result of the Brexit.\n\nThe halving\n\nIn addition to yuan devaluation and the Brexit, one event that generated significant visibility during the first half of 2016 was the halving.\n\nBitcoin miners compete to create blocks in the blockchain by verifying transactions, and every time a miner generates one of these blocks, it receives a reward. Originally, that reward was 50 BTC, but that amount was cut to 25 BTC in 2012. On 9th July, however, the bitcoin reward was further reduced to 12.5 BTC.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, described the upcoming halving as ""the great catalyst"" behind bitcoin\'s rise this year.\n\nHayes also identified the halving as playing a key role in bitcoin’s more than 50% climb thus far in 2016.\n\nHe emphasized that even though the currency’s community has yet to solve the challenges for scaling the network, these difficulties have been ""overshadowed"" by trading activity ahead of the halving.\n\nBitcoin’s path forward\n\nAmid this environment, bitcoin seems to be forging a new identity as a reliable safe-haven asset, but market observers provided varying predictions for where the price was likely to go next.\n\nZivkovski emphasized that while bitcoin has surged more than 50% in 2016, it faces many unresolved technical challenges, which could put pressure on the system through the end of the year.\n\n""For those reasons, we see a mean reversion play out over the coming months as players look to cash in and late-coming bulls are flushed, with support in the $400s, at which point a pump and dump cycle may start once again,” he said.\n\nEnneking offered a similar forecast, telling CoinDesk that “I think that bitcoin will fall back after the halving, but it will find support above $500.”\n\nIn contrast, Lee offered a rosier short-term prediction for the digital currency, stating that he expects bitcoin to finish 2016 at yearly highs of $800.\n\nNote: All figures reflect data from 1st January to 30th June, a period that marks the first six months of 2016.\n\nTeacher\'s desk image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As well as the music, I could release information about the moment I wrote it, where I wrote it, what gear I used, who has covered it, who else worked on it.”\n\nWhilst enthusiasm for such innovations is building, their implementation is not expected for several years yet.', 'The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a cease-and-desist order against the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) and its authorized participant SecondMarket, the latter of which has been ordered to disgorge roughly $50,000 in a settlement with the agency.\n\nOriginally founded by investor and Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert when he was CEO of SecondMarket, the BIT issues shares with a value tied to the value bitcoin, and unrestricted shares of the BIT are quoted on OTCQX.

Users will also be asked to enter their email address, which is where they will see their purchased BTC delivered. The prices for the cryptocurrency will be displayed in Pesos, with a paper receipt handed to the user upon completion of the transaction, much like a bitcoin ATM.\n\nCoinapult is notable for its “Locks” service which allows users to ‘lock’ the value of their value of bitcoin in fiat as a safeguard against price volatility. Fundamentally, if a customer locks $10,000 worth of bitcoins today, $10,000 in bitcoins can be cashed out at any point at a later time, regardless of bitcoin price at that time.\n\nIn March 2015, the Panamanian startup was the victim of a breach which saw its hot wallet compromised to the tune of 150 bitcoins, approximately $43,000 USD at the time.\n\nLater that month, Coinapult announced a collaboration with blockchain startup Factom.\n\n“Coinapult will benefit by providing information to our users about the safety of their funds. This has been one of our most popular user requests,” Coinapult CEO and co-founder Ira Miller told CCN at the time.\n\nThe company’s latest endeavor is certain to benefit bitcoin awareness and adoption in Colombia, with the cryptocurrency increasingly being seen as a store of value for the common investor.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Punto Pago.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Editor\'s Note: This is a guest post by Richard Howlett, Solicitor at Selachii LLP London.\n\nThere can be no debate that technological development has never been as fast, as complex or as creative as it is today. The only problem is, as with all revolutions, when things are moving this fast one has to be very careful when it comes to separating innovation from irritation; as more new tech is made available we have to develop that sixth sense that will allow us to separate what will actually help us from what definitely won’t.\n\nLet’s take fintech (and I’d include Bitcoin and blockchain under that umbrella) as an example:\n\nThis is an area that commercial litigation firms are coming into contact with more and more. Given that we are currently in the midst of a digital revolution, the scale of which we have never seen before and will probably never see again, I think we all agree digital currency and digital transactions aren’t only progress but an inevitability.\n\nYes, there are – as there are with all new ideas – some legal and accounting wrinkles to iron out, but the initial take-up for digital currency would suggest it has some fairly muscular legs to grow into.\n\nHowever, on the fringes of the fintech world we have seen some worrying developments. Buzzwords that long-term could prove to be as damaging as they are misleading in the short-term.\n\n""Smart contracts"" seem to be the buzzwords that are gaining increasing traction in the digital market. It is a sound enough idea, a contract that will rewrite itself according to commercial circumstances surrounding it by using a complex series of rules embedded in its coding.\n\nThe ideas behind it are equally as sound theoretically. Less input from the contracting parties means that smart contracts will come into being quicker and, therefore, allow for transactions to be raised and completed more quickly. Also, the fact that smart contracts require less input from both the parties involved and their lawyers, will make commerce more fluid and more cost-effective both in terms of time and legal fees.\n\nThe only potential problem is that once you get past the theory and examine the practical with a legal eye, you start to see that it is actually difficult to consider a smart contract as either smart or a contract and that it is probably more accurate to drop the term smart contract; instead, referring to them as automated computer code.\n\nFor those among you who think my stance may come from the fact that I’m a solicitor who is worried smart contracts might eat into my practice, I shall explain why smart contracts – in their current form at least – are not fit for purpose.\n\nThe first thing to consider is why a contract is required in the first place: It is there to protect the personal and/or commercial interests of the parties, which means it is contingent on two key sources:\n\nThe prior agreement of the parties on the heads of terms included within the contract. The legal experience required to turn those heads of terms into a viable legal document.\n\nOnce that contract is in place, coding could provide continued support for that contract and, indeed, for similar contracts involving similar terms for similar transactions. I would even suggest the code could probably even be taught to make small alterations as long as those alterations were foreseeable and logical.\n\nHowever, I am highly cynical about a code’s ability to make more complex binding/sustainable legal decisions required to build the foundations of a robust commercial contract or negotiate the best possible terms for all of the parties involved. This means that in the first instance at least, a lawyer will still need to be involved.\n\nAlso, code works on linear decision-making and probability, but more often than not, finding the right answer to settle a particular contractual nuance is a much more lateral process and requires a level of creativity and flexibility that can come only from real-life experience. To inject that depth of practical experience into code is, I would suggest, a nigh on impossible task.\n\nThis takes us on to another potential failing: If things turn sour between the contracted parties, who is there to sort things out? There is a common myth that a smart contract cannot be litigated, but I would disagree. As long as the heads of terms that sit behind the contracts are clear – and have clearly been accepted by the parties – there is scope to litigate if the code is deemed not to be fit for purpose or has affected the transactions it is meant to support and/or the payments associated with those transactions.\n\nThis is, however, where things could get more complicated. As there is currently no international internet law, the original contract would have to set out the jurisdictions of the parties and which country’s law the contract is reliant upon. Again, these aren’t decisions that code can make, so these definitions and agreements would have to be made by people, quite possibly with specialist legal advice.\n\nAnd that is why I don’t believe that smart contracts in their current form can be considered smart or contracts. As I said earlier, I don’t want this to come across as just another defensive letter of self-preservation from a lawyer in fear of losing fees. As an experienced litigator who has fought for years to ensure my clients always get the best possible protection from their commercial contracts, it concerns me is that an idea or even just a buzzword could lead numerous businesses into difficult and potentially very costly situations just because they had bought into the next big thing.', 'Last month, Sweden’s largest precious metal dealer posted a notice that their bank account had been closed without their consent.\n\nTavex Guld & Valuta posted a notice on June 30th that their bank account had been unilaterally closed. This left the dealer without an efficient way of accepting payments for good, racing to establish a new payment system.\n\nShut down because of banks pushing for a cashless society\n\nA notice screenshotted from the Tavex website read as follows:\n\n“Best customer, We hereby announce that as of 15:30, Thursday, June 30, 2016, we can no longer accept bank transfers or bank deposits for gold and silver to our Swedish SEB account. The reason for this is that SEB – at very short notice – informed us that they will close down our bank account. This decision has, unfortunately, been made without first consulting us, and in addition to state in its notification letter that the decision to close our account due to “a general business decisions,” they have not yet given us any concrete reason why they decided to take this measure. The banking system in Sweden is operated however vigorously towards a cashless society, as you probably are aware of, and Tavex has, as one of the largest wholesale suppliers of physical notes and investment metals in Sweden, as we see it become a target for the major commercial banks. With that said, we are working frantically to set up a new payment system that we believe will be operational in two to three weeks.”\n\nAt time of writing, the notice appears to be gone.\n\nBitcoin can’t be revoked or shut down\n\nAs opposed to banking systems, Bitcoin does not run the risk of being shut down. Over 6 million account applications were denied by UK banks over the past two years, while US citizens increasingly fear online shopping and other internet activity over privacy concerns. Meanwhile, with demand for tax havens growing, Bitcoin conveniently solves all of the above problems.\n\nRecently, Uber had the same issue in Argentina Tavex experienced in Sweden, with the use of credit cards for payments being unilaterally denied. Thankfully, Uber switched to Xapo Bitcoin debit cards, saving the company from having to shut down Argentine operations.', ""The European Union has released a new €50 note with advanced security features as a measure to fight counterfeiting. Unlike its multiple fiat counterparts, counterfeiting is not a problem with Bitcoin.\n\nEurope's New €50 Note\n\nThe €50 note is the most widely used in circulation, accounting for 45% of all euros in circulation. As such, it is a prime target for counterfeiters. The European Central Bank has therefore implemented multiple new security features in the notes, which counterfeiters will find hard to replicate. These include a hologram of Europa (a figure from Greek mythology), a new watermark and a new emerald green reflective paint. These new notes are expected to come into circulation in April 2017.\n\nCounterfeiting – Worldwide Problem\n\nCounterfeiting is a worldwide problem and various governments are grappling with it. It is estimated that ~0.01% of dollars circulating worldwide could be counterfeit. It is not just criminal gangs who indulge in counterfeiting. Rogue nations have also used counterfeiting as a means to wage proxy wars. The USA has alleged that North Korea and Iran have been issuing high-quality counterfeit dollar notes to undermine the importance of the dollar. While nations routinely upgrade the technology used in printing notes, it is difficult to tackle the problem when other countries misuse technology available to them to issue counterfeit notes. Electronic currency does not fully solve the problem, as high-quality counterfeit currency notes may not be detected if deposited in small town bank branches.\n\nBitcoin – The Currency of the Future\n\nThe equivalent of counterfeiting in Bitcoin is double spending – i.e. spending the same coins twice by a user. The risk of double spending declines with increasing number of confirmations. If you accept transactions which have six or more confirmations, the risk of bitcoins received by you being double-spent declines to virtually zero.

The report then traces the transaction history between these entities over time, finding that the first two phases of the network were dominated by mining activities and ""sin enterprises"" respectively.\n\nThe third and current phase, the report said, is now dominated by legitimate merchants and exchanges.\n\n""We can thus refer to the first regime as the \'proof of concept\' or \'mining-dominated\' phase, the second as the \'sin\' or \'gambling/black market-dominated\' phase, and the third as the \'maturation\' or \'exchange-dominated\' phase,"" the paper reads.\n\nNotably, the report asserts this has happened even as the number of illicit black market websites has increased in the wake of the shutdown of the original Silk Road, one of the earliest significant drivers of bitcoin commerce.\n\nUser behavior\n\nThe report also revealed new information about the activities of the entities it was able to identify and classify on the bitcoin network.\n\nFor instance, the report found the average gambler bets 0.5 BTC on average, and that these individuals often make multiple bets in the same day. Likewise, the average observable transaction between user-dealers and black market services was 3 BTC.\n\nBy comparison, the average transaction between a trader and an exchange, the report said, is for 20 BTC, with traders buying or selling via these services roughly every 11 days.\n\nThe researchers told CoinDesk they plan to submit the paper for feedback before publishing it in an academic journal.\n\nMarijuana image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Gill Plimmer JULY 12, 2016 2 Britain’s decision to trial the use of the technology behind bitcoin to pay welfare benefits to the unemployed and disabled has sparked privacy concerns. The Department for Work and Pensions began a trial in June of the system, which uses blockchain technology to pay benefits directly to welfare claimants. GovCoin Systems, the UK technology company behind the blockchain system, said initial trials had proved successful but that final results being collated by University of College of London were not expected until October. “Claimants are using an app on their phones through which they are receiving and spending their benefit payments,” David Freud, the welfare reform minister, told a payments conference last week. “With their consent, their transactions are being recorded on a distributed ledger to support their financial management.” If successful, the technology could be used for everything from tax collection to the sharing of health records, according to a government report released this year. Advocates of blockchain technology argue it is more secure and transparent, cutting down the risk of fraud and error. But welfare campaigners are concerned it would allow the DWP to check that payments are spent only on certain things. Critics including the Open Data Institute, which was established by David Cameron in 2012 to promote transparency in government, described the move as “very concerning”. “Experimenting with putting highly personal data in immutable data stores is fraught with danger,” said Jeni Tennison, the ODI’s technical director and deputy director. “To avoid undermining trust in government’s use of data, DWP should be much more open and transparent about the policy objective of these trials, the safeguards they are putting in place to limit the risks and the lessons being learnt through the trial.” GovCoin said it was aware of the ODI’s concerns and had taken the data protection and privacy issues seriously. The DWP said it would “continue to monitor new innovations in the marketplace which would represent value for money, safeguard information and protect and improve payments to customers. Related article Blockchain raises fundamental questions Banking and law will be fundamentally changed if shared ledger technology takes off “This trial is designed to explore how distributed ledger technology could help support financial inclusion and budgeting support through the anonymous capture of data and does not place any restrictions or limits on what a claimant can spend their welfare payments on,” it added. Blockchain is the shared database technology that is best known for powering the bitcoin online currency. In this case, a digital “benefit coin” could effectively replace welfare payments in sterling. GovCoin said it was in discussions with other countries that are considering using the technology. Honduras is using it to handle land titles, while the Isle of Man has begun testing it with a registry of companies on the island. Estonia has been experimenting with distributed ledger technology that allows citizens to verify the integrity of their records on government databases. Blockchain has been hailed by admirers as holding the promise that the internet did two decades ago. Banks, insurers and companies ranging from IBM to PwC are also seeking to harness the power of the blockchain, in the belief that it could lead to greater efficiency. But IT experts caution that blockchain technology is still at an early stage of development and moving any of Britain’s public services away from their existing IT systems is likely to prove difficult, expensive and potentially risky.

Logically, with the growing popularity of Bitcoin, the average block size is getting closer to its limit.\n\nIn this environment, it is surprising to see a number of empty blocks being mined. An empty block is not entirely empty, it has 1 transaction : the coinbase transaction which allocates the mining reward to the miner (12.5 bitcoins at the time of writing). It is important to know, that empty blocks are not easier, cheaper or quicker to mine than full blocks. The ratio of empty blocks varies considerably from one mining pool to the other. For instance, Bitfury, BitClub Network and Kano CKPool do not mine empty blocks.\n\nWhy are there empty blocks?\n\nWhen a mining pool receives a new block from a competitor, it needs to perform a few actions: download the full block, validate its transactions and define a new block to mine on. During this - albeit short -interval, so as not to waste hashing power, they start mining a new block. Only the coinbase transaction is included, so the previous block does not invalidate theirs with a duplicate transaction.\n\nThis validationless mining (or SPV mining) phenomenon can be seen on the Kaiko blockchain page , with empty blocks being mined just after a normal block, when the mempool is far from empty.\n\nThe number of empty blocks is dropping\n\nThe share of empty blocks has fallen across the board over the past few months, although the timing has not been quite the same for all pools. The main theory behind this is the improvements made in the mining software, especially Bitcoin Core 0.12, which reduces the time between the validation of a block mined by another pool and the mining of a new non empty block\n\nThese improvements included (but were not limited to):\n\nImprovement which allowed for pre calculation of some of the work required for a miner to validate all the transactions in the block (rather than doing it at block creation time)\n\nRelay Network configuration improvements which includes a technically simplified (and quicker) prioritisation of transactions to help miners decide which transactions to include in a block\n\nBitcoin Core GetBlockTemplate - improvement by which the individual miner requests the composition of the block to mine- optimizations. More details are available here: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/02/23/release-0.12.0/\n\nIs it bad?\n\nThe whole point of the Bitcoin network is to process transactions. Therefore, empty blocks are often criticised as ""bad behaviour"" as creating very little value for the network by accelerating disinflation and stealing from ""honest"" miners.\n\nHowever, it can also be considered as counter-balancing the centralisation tendency of the network: a pool which wins a block can start mining the next block immediately since they already know which transactions were included in the block. Whereas other miners first have to download the transactions, and then generate a new block which doesn\'t include any of them. The ability to mine with just the header, could be considered to limit the benefits of centralisation.\n\nTechnically, it could be easily prevented by including, for example , a hash of the current coinbase concatenated with all the previous transactions in the block header. The recent fall in the number of empty blocks shows that the issue can be contained through improvements in the protocol which make mining empty blocks less interesting. Additionally, the gradual decrease of the block reward and the increased reliance on transaction fees will likely make mining empty blocks unprofitable over time.', 'Bitcoin Surpasses Gold Trading in Brazil\n\nThe big difference is the thousand years track record of gold against just seven years of bitcoin.During the first six months of 2016, bitcoin trading volume on Brazilian crypto exchanges surpassed that of gold spot trading on the Brazilian Securities, Commodities and Futures Exchange (BM&F BOVESPA). In this period, over R$ 164 million (~US$47 mi) were traded on the specialized exchanges, while gold spot contracts (for 250 g and 10 g equivalent bars) registered around R$153 million (~US$44 mi). In June, bitcoin trading volume was twice the precious metal volume.\n\nThis unprecedented and historic milestone confirms the strong growth the cryptocurrency has had in Brazil. According to website bitValor.com, June’s year-to-date bitcoin volume exceeds by 45% its entire trading volume in 2015, when local exchanges reported R$ 113 million worth of transactions. This year’s first semester is commensurate to the last three years combined.\n\nAdmittedly, these volumes pale in comparison to what goes on in the world and in more developed nations, both in the gold and crypto markets. Nevertheless, one should not underestimate this historic and important milestone for bitcoin in Brazil.\n\nGlobally, gold is still an asset with higher volumes than bitcoin. As claimed by the London Bullion Markets Association, the average daily value of gold transfers is roughly US$ 20 billion, whereas bitcoin trades amount to over US$ 1.5 billion.\n\nSuch market data as well as recent developments indicate bitcoin is increasingly being perceived as a new safe-haven asset, to which investors can resort in times of crisis. In short, it is a genuine competitor to gold. The big difference is the thousand years track record of gold against just seven years of bitcoin. But this is surely nothing time can’t solve.\n\nFernando Ulrich is a member of the board of directors of Mises Brazil.\n\nThis article was originally published on FEE.org. Read the original article.', '', 'Currency behind social media website Steemit, in which users are rewarded or paid based number of ‘thumbs up’, has rocketed to more than $150m in value\n\nSteem, the digital currency behind the new social media website Steemit, soared more than 1,000% in value on Tuesday to more than $150m, two weeks after it first paid people who posted on its website, according to coinmarketcap.com.\n\n\n\nSteemit rewards or pays users who post content that gets multiple thumbs up from the site’s participants. The reward given is the steem currency. Content on the site is not limited to digital currencies and users have posted varied topics from lasagne to a trip to North Africa.\n\n“It’s basically an incentivized social media platform,” said Steemit’s chief executive, Ned Scott, in an interview. The steem currency’s price on Tuesday was $1.75, equivalent to a market cap of $151.8m. That is the value of the 81.6m steems in circulation. On 4 July, when Steemit first paid users with steem for their content, the currency’s value was only $13m, according to Scott.\n\nOf the 657 digital currencies tracked by price index site Coinmarket, Steem is the fifth-largest in terms of market cap. Digital currencies have gained broad appeal among investors as a mechanism to transfer assets without a third party or clearing agency.\n\nUsers who get the steem currency can then exchange it for bitcoin within the platform. They can use their bitcoin to pay for services or goods or hold them as an investment.\n\nSteemit is similar to social media website Reddit and Facebook in the way it operates, encouraging users to post and share content. However, Steemit is also powered by blockchain, the underlying technology that anchors digital currencies such as bitcoin.\n\nThe new social media website was launched on an experimental basis without the rewards on 4 May.\n\n“There were many, many people looking at this project, several hundreds of users per day,” said Scott. “And when they experienced that first payout on 4 July, they bought something for their mother, they paid debt. And it suddenly felt real to everyone.”\n\nSteems are created solely by the platform’s blockchain, whereas bitcoin is generated through a mining process where a miner tries to solve a set of complex mathematical problems.\n\nScott said the company had a “superangel” investor that helped it get off the ground last February. It will use this momentum to raise funds from institutional investors.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin has undergone its “halving” event which happens every four years or after every 210,000 blocks of transactions. This event, according to a law in its rulebook, cuts in half the value of the digital payout that the ‘miners’ receive for supporting the network by providing computing resources.\n\nThe halving event provides a reward to Bitcoin backers who are basically supplying CPU time and electricity that enables the Bitcoin network to survive. While the markets were prepared for the impact of the event, some miners received less than what they anticipated. The bonus was dropped to 12.5 Bitcoins per processed block from 25, which is directly going to impact the number of miners. According to CoinDesk data, the halving event also resulted in price fall of 5 percent which translates to $627 (Rs 42,096) per Bitcoin, a drop from $660 (Rs 44,305).\n\nEver since its launch, the value of Bitcoin has gone up to about 50 percent, but the concept is still relatively new for the majority of population. According to analysts, the valuation will remain constant for the coming few years, but could see a huge drop if the miners are not satisfied with their cuts.\n\nThere have already been some fallout in anticipation of the halving event. KnCMiner, a Swedish Bitcoin mining firm filed for bankruptcy in May citing the fact that the mining operation would no longer be viable. There is stiff competition from Chinese miners, and Bitcoin mining companies have to streamline operations and run lean setups to remain active. The next halving event is scheduled for 2020.\n\nUpdate: The prices recovered sharply, to $655 (Rs 43,970) per bitcoin, before starting on a downward trend again.', 'Leading Bitcoin payment processor, BitPay, recently endorsed an innovative Bitcoin company, ShapeShift.

07/13/2016,"['New York-based Blockchain service company, SolidX Partners Inc., recently filed a Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list their new Bitcoin Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n\nFounded in 2014, SolidX Partners Inc. develops blockchain products and services focusing on software applications and capital markets. The company provides software for recording digital records, transfer of assets, and identity.\n\nThe new Trust will be called SolidX Bitcoin Trust, listed under the symbol XBTC. Formed this year, the Trust is classified as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and is eligible for some reporting requirement exemptions. According to the filing, the Trust is not actively managed.\n\n- SolidX\n\n\n\nThe XBX is a real-time, U.S. dollar-denominated, composite reference rate for the price of bitcoin. The sponsor and calculation agent for the XBX is Schvey, Inc., better known in the community as TradeBlock.\n\n“As of June 30, 2016, the eligible bitcoin exchanges selected by TradeBlock include Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and OKCoin International,” the company wrote in its SEC filing.\n\nEach share of the SolidX bitcoin Trust will represent a unit of ownership in the trust, but not in the company running it. They’re offering a “fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust,” according to the filing.“The Shares are neither interests in nor obligations of the Sponsor or the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates.”\n\nThe Trust Sponsor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SolidX Partners Inc, SolidX Management LLC. The administrator and custodian is the Bank of New York Mellon, who will be responsible for day-to-day administration.\n\nIn order to achieve its objective, the Trust will be “investing substantially all of its assets in bitcoin traded on various domestic and international bitcoin exchanges and over-the-counter (‘OTC’) markets depending on liquidity and otherwise at the Sponsor’s discretion.”\n\nThe Trust has identified seven major exchanges that they’ll use; Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, ItBit, Kraken, and OKCoin. BTC-E was specifically excluded.\n\n- SolidX\n\nHowever, the Sponsor “expects to conduct most of its trading in the OTC bitcoin market,” the filing states. OTC trading is typically done between institutions, in large volumes, and could be cost efficient.\n\nSolidX Management, as the Sponsor, will be responsible for the purchase and custody of the Trust’s bitcoin, which will be the Trust’s main asset. Trust can occasionally hold cash for a short period of time, when in the process of purchasing and selling bitcoin or paying expenses such as the Sponsor’s management fee.\n\nThe Sponsor’s management fee will be calculated as a percentage of the net asset value of the Trust. The actual percentage was not disclosed in the filing.\n\nTo safeguard the trust’s underlying assets, bitcoin, SolidX has listed a security plan using multi-signature wallets in cold storage. These will be air-gapped USB flash drives that are physically secured. The Sponsor also uses multi-signature transactions when transferring bitcoin.\n\n- SolidX\n\nAs part of their disaster recovery plans, the cold storage will be wholly duplicated off-site in multiple locations, “geographically distributed throughout the United States, including in the Northeast and Midwest.”\n\nSolidX has also precured private insurance on the funds, to protect against theft, destruction, computer fraud, loss of private keys, hacking attacks, and any kind of loss while bitcoins are in transit. There is no FDIC guarantee on any of the funds.\n\nThere are, of course, terms and conditions with the insurance policy. It starts out with a $25 million primary crime insurance policy, while “Excess Vault Risk Insurance” protects private keys from loss up to a maximum of $100 million more, with a catch; It requires the cold wallets be stored in a particular way, such as in a safety deposit box.\n\nSolidX is not the first company to file with the SEC seeking to list a bitcoin exchange-traded product. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss first filed their Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust with the SEC three years ago. There has since been little progress, until very recently.\n\nOn June 29th the Winklevoss twins lodged their 6th amendment to the original SEC filing. The amendment switched the nominated exchange from Nasdaq to BATS, which is the largest ETF exchange in the US and Europe. The SEC has recently opened the proposal for public comment and says that a decision will be made by August 22.\n\n- SolidX\n\nThere are similar bitcoin exchange-traded products that did not go through the arduous processing of listing with the SEC. Bitcoin Tracker One and Bitcoin Tracker EUR managed by Swedish XBT Provider, for example, are exchange-traded notes (ETNs) traded on the Nasdaq Nordic. Another similar product is Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), a private, open-ended trust available to accredited investors, quoted on the OTCQX marketplace.\n\nIf SolidX’s registration is approved by the SEC soon, there is a chance that its Trust could beat the Winklevoss investment Trust as first to the market, despite the Winklevoss’ three years head start.', 'It may soon be easier for average investors to get in on the bitcoin craze without dealing with some of the risks.\n\nBlockchain startup SolidX published an initial public offering filing on Tuesday (July 12) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a bitcoin fund listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSolidX’s filing to list publicly underscores the growing interest in bitcoin as an investment asset. Gemini, a bitcoin exchange run by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, recently filed to become a bitcoin trust on the BATS exchange.\n\nThe SolidX bitcoin ETF has a unique property: bitcoins will be insured against loss or theft up to $10,000,000. There are dozens of situations where bitcoins can be lost or stolen—like, say, misplacing one’s hard drive.\n\n“Insuring the underlying assets in any trust makes sense, regardless of whether those assets are physical commodities, intellectual property, or cryptocurrency,” explained Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at bitcoin and blockchain policy firm Coin Center. “These things can be stolen, misplaced, or destroyed and insurance companies help us mitigate those risks and ensure that investors are protected against inherently unpredictable events.”\n\nUnpredictable events happen all the time in the virtual currency world. In 2014, $460 million suddenly disappeared from Mt. Gox, one of the biggest bitcoin exchanges at the time and a seemingly reputable firm. More recently, an attacker funneled $50 million from the Distributed Autonomous Organization that was built on top of Ethereum, another virtual currency network similar to bitcoin.\n\nBut investors are understandably interested in bitcoin. Bitcoin Tracker One, a trust listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, is up 66% since April 1. Greyscale Bitcoin Trust, which trades on the OTC markets and was created by Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert, is up 120% over the same period. Since those are on smaller exchanges, they are more difficult for investors to access.', 'Bitcoin has a fair amount of mainstream critics and “haters” when it comes to its value and relevance as a globally traded currency. Some of this is borne out of an equal amount of fear and ignorance of what Bitcoin is and represents, while a portion is also based, legitimately, on recent events like the Hash Ocean collapse.\n\nBe that as it may, Bitcoin has proven to be quite valuable and relevant to those looking to protect their wealth under these ever more turbulent economic times. People stop snickering at Bitcoin when they actually do the research and discover the impressive value the digital currency has to offer. When it comes down to it, the smart money has been on Bitcoin for quite awhile, and the mainstream is beginning to notice this fact.\n\nBitcoin becomes a financial “safe haven”\n\nIn the world of economics, the term “safe haven” is a relative term. From the fall of 2013, through the Mt. Gox collapse, to early-2015, Bitcoin was seen as a laughing stock, rising 800%, only to crash back to previous levels. Well, nobody\'s laughing now, especially those invested in the British Pound and Euro.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Bitcoin has become less volatile than the Pound since the Brexit, and this may not change for some time. British pound values have dropped to 30-year lows and investors are moving quickly into BTC for relief.\n\nJesse Powell, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based Kraken, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange in euro volume, says:\n\n""A lot of people are buying Bitcoin for pounds and Euros. Our (euro-based Bitcoin) volume has doubled…..we saw a huge spike in that market. People are looking for a safe place to keep their money, amidst all of this uncertainty.”\n\nWorld’s best performing currency\n\nFor those caught unaware of the Bitcoin value equation over the last eighteen months, Bitcoin was simply the world’s best performing currency in 2015, gaining over 35% against the global reserve currency, the U.S. Dollar.\n\nThis was about 4X the growth of the Dollar itself during the same time period. 2016 is proving to be even better, as Bitcoin started the year in the $430 range, and is now trading in the mid-$600’s, an almost 50% increase in value.\n\nGil Luria, managing director at Wedbush Securities Inc., told Bloomberg via email:\n\n""I believe bitcoin has seen some of the benefit from the Brexit over the last few days as consumers are buying bitcoin as an asset uncorrelated with the global monetary system, much like gold. If other countries in the EU pursue a similar path, I would expect some of their citizens to look at the British experience and want to protect some of their funds in bitcoin. Even though bitcoin is volatile, volatility is better than knowing your money will be devalued by 10-30 percent within a few weeks.""\n\nStrong investment case\n\nWhether a mainstream investor understands what a Bitcoin is or not, it doesn’t take many math skills to see such Bitcoin returns as a strong investment case.\n\nAs the image provided by Bloomberg indicates, nothing is appreciating at the rate of Bitcoin in 2016, and last week’s “bitcoin halving” may only increase this economic advantage throughout the rest of 2016.\n\nThose who have invested in Bitcoin are prospering, while those deep into the Euro and British Pound are ready to make nice with “The Internet of Money” like never before. This reminds me of an old bank commercial, “What’s in your (digital) wallet?”', 'Steem, the cryptocurrency behind decentralized social media platform Steemit, has soared by 1,700% in value in less than ten days, moving from a market capitalization of US$13 million in early July, to US$225 million at the time of writing. This makes Steem the world’s fourth most valuable cryptocurrency behind bitcoin, ether and ripple.\n\nFollowing Steemit’s first major distribution – a payout of 10% of Steem’s market cap – on July 04, the number of transactions, posts, votes and new users sign ups has tripled. The startup now aims at becoming “one of the largest and fastest growing cryptocurrency projects in the world.”\n\nSteemit’s blockchain has been handling hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading volume each day, with each transaction, post, and upvote subject available to anyone to consult.\n\nFounded less than three months ago, Steemit is a decentralized social media platform similar in design to Reddit. Its particularity is that it allows users to reward and be rewarded for sharing, posting, and voting for content.\n\nAccording to Steemit’s CEO and co-founder Ned Scott, the financial incentive inherent to the platform has allowed it to gain much popularity in a very short period of time. Through Steemit, users and content creators can monetize their time and their energies, and share in the profits.\n\n“Before Steemit, consumers have away their efforts for free, uploading thoughts, blogs and other content to every social networks; now they can do it and get truly rewarded for their participation,” Scott said.\n\n“Everyday users are jumping onboard our social network and many early adopters have benefited. People have started saying that they have paid their rent with money earned on Steemit. Others have bought cell phones, washing machines, and even paid their electricity bills. We have constructed perhaps the first blockchain application that anyone can use,” Scott said.\n\nSteemit is built on an open source blockchain called Steem. Rewards are distributed half in “Steem Power,” a vesting currency that supercharges voting power on the platform, and “Steem Dollars,” a token representing one USD.\n\nSteemit, which is still in beta, is working on a number of core social media features, Scott told CoinJournal in an interview a few weeks ago. This includes a Steemit button on blogs that would “push an author’s article and their fan’s comments to the blockchain to be eligible for rewards.”\n\nSteemit also plans to develop sidechain plugins which would allow Steem to support a decentralized app-store, similar in appearance to Facebook and Google’s, but based on decentralized, provably-fair technologies and new business models.', 'Domain registry Donuts Inc. has made an investment in Netki, a Los Angeles-based startup whose technology generates user-friendly “wallet names” for the bitcoin digital currency and other blockchain-based applications, replacing complicated alphanumeric wallet addresses.\n\nIt’s the second investment by Bellevue, Wash.-based Donuts out if its new Donuts Labs initiative, through which it’s investing in startups that create new uses for domain names or otherwise complement the company’s core strengths.

Bitcoin trading is surpassing that of gold in Brazil, by nearly 7 percent.\n\nFurthermore, the bitcoin trading volume from January 2016 up to June 2016 has already exceeded 2015’s entire trading volume of the most widely known and popular cryptocurrency, by 45%. The trading volume during the first half of 2016 has even exceeded those recorded during first six months of the past three years, in total.\n\nThe remarkable increase in trading and awareness of bitcoin further underlines its status it enjoys as a safe haven with investors.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has increased by nearly 50% of its value since the turn of the year and observers have pointed to a number of factors behind the surge in value. Two commonly touted reasons: the increased demand from buyers in China and; the Brexit vote, show similarities. A weakening, stagnating economy and a gloomy economic forecast and outlook, leading to investors flocking to bitcoin.\n\nIn the global market, numbers from the London bullion market show anywhere between $150 billion to $240 billion in OTC gold market trades, compared to an estimated $142 million in bitcoin traded over the past 24 hours.\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency is still at a nascent stage, some investment houses and experts are already turning from gold to bitcoin as a store of wealth.

The first Real Property ownership transfer, facilitated by Ubitquity, can be easily viewed and publicly searched on the Colored Coins block explorer,” said Nathan Wosnack, Founder & CEO at Ubitquity.\n\nThe approach Ubiquity is using is a space that business continues to explore how to use blockchain-powered applications to provide security for documents. Other companies attempting the same include Factom, who partnered with the government of Honduras to secure land ownership records (although those plans are currently stalled) and Guardtime AS partnered with the government of Estonia to secure one million e-health records.

According to Bitcoin.com News, this mechanism is designed to permit instant payments between users while also making them fast, cheap and commonplace.\n\nInstant payment channels are a big deal for blockchain-powered cryptocurrency and a potential “killer app” for the technology to allow people to make tiny payments on the fly in a number of circumstances. These opportunities may include pay-per-view websites that cost cents (or fractions of a cent) for each read, micropayments for “tipping” content creators and tiny payments for virtual items in online games.\n\nThe challenge with micropayments on blockchains (including the Bitcoin blockchain) to date have included the 10-minute confirmation time for payments and the application of transaction fees that would exceed any penny-fraction sent. Solutions to these problems have been floated by side-chain networks and outside payment processors such as the Lightning Network (which is being used by Storj/Counterparty “picopayments”), ChangeTip and Coinbase Tipping.\n\n“Payment channels allow for instant, ‘streaming’ payments of SJCX,” said Storj CEO Shawn Wilkinson, “which is a Counterparty token, in exchange for storage space on our network.”\n\nStorj is an encrypted, distributed storage platform designed to allow users to store anything in the cloud and retrieve it securely. Counterparty is a protocol and platform that extends Bitcoin to provide the capability to create crypto-assets and then use them as tokens of exchange.\n\nCounterparty lead developer Ruben de Vries said about the collaboration, “This is a huge step forward that will truly allow for rapid, almost frictionless Counterparty token payments, as well as eventual use of Counterparty tokens on the Lightning Network.”\n\nAnother reason not to download unknown Pokémon GO APK files for Android\n\nAs the popularity of Pokémon GO skyrockets, players who otherwise could not install the game on their smartphones have been looking for ways to get into the game. This has led to the release of malware infected versions of Pokémon GO distributed through 3rd-party sites that place users in danger of security risks.\n\nAmid these security risks, The Merkle reports, APKs downloaded from 3rd-party sites may also endanger Bitcoin wallets stored on phones that they are downloaded and installed on.\n\nThis is not unexpected. Backdoored malicious apps installed on a smartphone can gain access to contacts, keys pressed, stored data, anything sent over the network and install other more in-depth attacks. With this sort of access, it could become trivial to determine the cryptographic key used to secure the Bitcoin wallet on a phone.\n\nJohn McAfee, cybersecurity expert and man-of-mystery, previously outlined how he himself would proceed with an attack against a Bitcoin wallet on a mobile device.\n\n“I would first plant readily available spyware on the device,” McAfee told SiliconANGLE. “I could plant it through an email phishing scheme, or by inducing you to visit a website (A website drive-by is sufficient to set the ‘download unauthorized applications’ flag on Android for example. A subsequent click-through would plant the malware), or using any one of hundreds of other means.”\n\nFor his first step a maliciously infected APK would be a perfect entry and from there backdoor access would overcome a lot of modern security measures.\n\nNo Man’s Sky website accepts Bitcoin payments for pre-orders\n\nIn an unexpected move, much-anticipated upcoming video game release No Man’s Sky started accepting Bitcoin payments for pre-orders of the PC version of the game. The option appears when clicking on the No Man’s Sky about page and then clicking on the “More Options” under payments.\n\nNo Man’s Sky has been hyped on the video game marketing scene since its announcement in 2013 by developer Hello Games, which promises to be a procedurally generated universe space simulation with almost limitless space to explore. It is a first-person, open world survival game where players act as planetary explorers in the above-mentioned unexplored universe.\n\nThe game has had its release date pushed back once already and is currently slated for release August 9, 2016.\n\nBrief outage of Coinbase website, platform and API yesterday\n\nYesterday, major Bitcoin web wallet, exchange and merchant processor Coinbase, Inc. suffered a brief outage of its platform that lasted approximately fifteen minutes for some customers. The outage occurred on July 12, 2016 between 13:50 PDT and resolved completely by 14:04 PDT.\n\nThe Coinbase website and API are currently offline. The engineering team is investigating urgently. https://t.co/bTnGxqYz8a — Coinbase (@coinbase) July 12, 2016\n\nThe nature of the issue has not yet been released by Coinbase representatives.\n\nFeatured image credit: via reddit member huevos_de_acero', 'Reports from Russia indicate a minor political party is moving to accept bitcoin donations.\n\nThe Party of Growth, a center-right party formed in 2009 under the name Just Cause, is reportedly looking to begin accepting donations in the digital currency. The move is notable given the Russian government\'s complicated and long-controversial stance on digital currencies like bitcoin.\n\nNews of the donation drive comes in light of reports from Interfax and TASS that cover remarks from Boris Titov, the head of the Party of Growth and an advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin on business and entrepreneurial issues.\n\nAccording to Interfax, Titov cited the need to source funding for the party from new avenues, including crowdfunding, as a motivation for the decision. Further, he reportedly indicated that the party would only accept bitcoin donations from people with verified identities.\n\nTASS offered additional details, reporting that the party is looking at the donation effort as a means to promote the acceptance of digital currencies in Russia. According to the state-owned news service, the party is promising legislation that would ease the technology\'s path to further adoption and development in the country.\n\nTitov reportedly said during a press conference (according to a Google Translation):\n\n""Russia can take advantage of the difficult economic situation that has developed today for us to become a very profitable country open to [blockchain].""\n\nThe pronouncements come two months before Russia holds parliamentary elections, in which the Party of Growth is seeking to gain a foothold in the national legislature.\n\nThe party currently holds no seats in the Duma, with just two representatives seated in Russia\'s regional legislatures. Whether the party can move ahead with its legislative ambitions for digital currencies may be incumbent on its success at the polls later this year.\n\nAs covered previously, Russia has had a fractious relationship with bitcoin, stemming from years-long efforts among some elements of its government to outlaw the production and use of so-called money surrogates.\n\nAt the same time, financial companies, as well as Russia\'s central bank, have moved to explore applications of the blockchain amidst this environment.\n\nImage Credit: ID1974 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The “hack” of The DAO and the ensuing debate over whether funds should be returned to DAO token holders via a hard fork has been the biggest story in cryptocurrency recently — with the temporary exception of Bitcoin’s halving event. While the Ethereum community is still trying to figure out how they’re going to deal with the problems associated with The DAO, at least two security experts believe more trouble could be found further down the road.\n\nMore Disasters to Come?\n\nChristopher Allen is the co-author of the TLS security standard and principal architect at Blockstream. In his view, serious changes are needed to avoid situations similar to The DAO in the future. When asked if he thinks more of these disasters will happen with Ethereum in the coming years, Allen responded, “I think [they] will if we don’t move to more conservative approaches when significant money is involved. Both Ethereum and Hyperledger rely on code execution of relatively arbitrary code on multiple computers.”\n\nEmin Gün Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell who researches distributed systems, is more certain that more spectacular failures are in Ethereum’s future. “Writing good contracts has always been difficult,” he stated. “Smart contracts are orders of magnitude more difficult to write, and there will probably be some spectacular failures ahead. The DAO was a wakeup call for improving the science of smart contracts, so we can avoid some of them.”\n\nEthereum a Useful Testbed for Smart Contracts\n\nAlthough Allen and Sirer believe there could be more disasters built on top of Ethereum in the future, they also see the platform’s value as an early testbed for distributed smart contracts. “I like that Ethereum with Solidity allows us to rapidly pilot various ideas and learn about problems not even discovered yet,” said Allen. “But I am a long way from trusting it with a significant amount of money. For that community, a new, more limited language on top the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) may be a better choice.”\n\n“Our (the #RebootingWebOfTrust) smart signatures project may be among those more specific, narrower, yet constrained solutions. At some point I could envision higher level tools passing smart signature proofs around as part of more complex smart contracts.”\n\nAllen stated that some simple DAO forms may be codified and secured for common and easy-to-implement use cases; however, he noted that some of the privacy, game theory, economics, and other external problems may be harder to figure out than simply making the smart contract secure. “Only then can we put multiple millions into a smart contract DAO,” said Allen.\n\nAllen also added, “To do what The DAO wanted to do (invest in projects and get a positive return on investment with minimal human intervention) — we don’t even know how to reliably do so in the venture capital and investment world, so that may be an example of the kind of real problems to overcome.”\n\nIn Sirer’s view, disasters like The DAO are inevitable when developing a new technology. “Had we backed down after Tacoma Narrows, we would not be able to span many of the bigger valleys with suspension bridges today,” he stated. “We need to explore the boundaries, and expect occasional failures.”\n\nImportant for Ethereum Community to Learn from Mistakes\n\nOf course, more disasters related to smart contracts will only be worth it if the community is able to learn from their mistakes. Sirer stated, “The determining factor in the success of a technology is: Did the community take away a scientific lesson from a disaster? Were they able to enact meaningful changes that made that kind of disaster unlikely to happen.”\n\nSirer claimed that the Bitcoin community has not learned from the mistakes that occurred with Mt. Gox. “People still trust their money to exchanges, and we still continue to have thefts from opaque exchanges entrusted with far too much cash,” he explained. “So, we can see that this pain point has not improved, and indeed, represents some kind of obstacle for more widespread adoption of the currency.”\n\nAlthough large thefts from bitcoin exchanges still take place, none of the recent thefts have been anywhere near the scale seen with Mt. Gox. It’s possible that The DAO will act as a similar event for the Ethereum community. Although future thefts may take place via Ethereum-based smart contracts, they may not involve anywhere near the more than $125 million taken from The DAO.\n\nSirer concluded, “I trust that the Ethereum community will not only take measures to fix The DAO hack (e.g. through a hard fork), but will also act to fund activities that will make similar failures less likely.”']"
07/14/2016,"[""Blockchain technology company SolidX Partners has announced that it has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the proposed launch of the SolidX Bitcoin Trust, a new Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) for traditional investors.\n\nAccording to the company's website, SolidX Partners provides blockchain-based software solutions relating to the indelible recording of digital records, transfer of assets, and identity. “SolidX also has a capital markets arm that has filed a FORM S-1 registration statement for a proposed launch of a bitcoin exchange traded fund,” reads a recently added paragraph.\n\nThe SolidX press release reveals that the ETF will list on NYSE Arca, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) market specialized in Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs), under the ticker symbol XBTC. The Trust, not actively managed, will provide shareholders with exposure to the daily change in the U.S. dollar price of Bitcoin, before expenses and liabilities of the Trust, as measured by the TradeBlock XBX Index.\n\nThe SolidX SEC filing has been covered by the financial press, including The Wall Street Journal and Reuters, which indicates the growing interest in Bitcoin among traditional investors who want to bet on (or short) the price of Bitcoin without going through the hassle of buying or selling the digital currency itself.\n\n“The SolidX Bitcoin [Trust] will issue SolidX Bitcoin [Shares], which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust,” states the filing. “The Trust’s assets will consist of bitcoin, an asset that can be transferred among parties via the Internet, but without the use of a central administrator or clearing agency. The Trust will occasionally hold cash for short periods in connection with the purchase and sale of bitcoin, and to pay Trust expenses. The Shares are issued by the Trust only in one or more blocks of 10,000 Shares, called a ‘Basket,’ principally in exchange for cash. The Trust will issue and redeem Shares in Baskets to certain registered [Authorized Participants]. Shares will be offered to the public from time to time at prices that will reflect, among other things, the price of bitcoin and the trading price of the Shares on NYSE Arca at the time of the offer.”\n\nNYSE Arca trades more than 8,000 exchange-listed securities and is ranked first in the listing and trading of ETPs, such as ETFs, exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs), According to NYSE Arca, ETPs are one of the fastest growing investment products in the world, combining the simplicity of stocks with the diversified risk of mutual funds.\n\nJerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, has analyzed the differences between the SolidX Bitcoin Trust and the long anticipated Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. The Winklevoss twins recently filed with the SEC to switch the listing of their proposed ETF Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust to Bats Global Markets from Nasdaq, CNBC reported last month.\n\nBrito notes that the most interesting contrast between the two proposed funds is what happens if their bitcoins are lost or stolen.\n\n“The Trust will not insure its bitcoin,” states the Winklevoss filing. On the contrary, SolidX has secured insurance for its bitcoin holdings.\n\n“The Trust will maintain crime, excess crime and excess vault risk insurance coverage underwritten by various insurance carriers,” states the SolidX filing. “The purpose of the insurance is to protect shareholders against loss or theft of the Trust’s bitcoin. The insurance will cover loss of bitcoin by, among other things, theft, destruction, bitcoin in transit, computer fraud (i.e., hacking attack) and other loss of the private keys that are necessary to access the bitcoin held by the Trust.” The insurance is explained in detail in the section “The Trust’s Bitcoin Insurance” of the filing.\n\n“Investors are understandably interested in bitcoin,” says a Quartz article, noting that Bitcoin Tracker One, a trust listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, is up 66 percent since April 1. Greyscale Bitcoin Trust, which trades on the OTC markets and was created by Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert, is up 120 percent over the same period.\n\n“Since those are on smaller exchanges, they are more difficult for investors to access,” concludes Quartz. In fact, it’s to be expected that availability on a major stock exchange like the NYSE will open XBTC to more investors, and boost Bitcoin’s appeal to traditional investors.\n\nPhoto Financial Times / Flickr(CC)"", 'The notorious Mark Karpeles, CEO of Mt Gox, was released on bail yesterday after paying nearly $100,000 prior to being released, according to Japanese media.\n\nIn 2014, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange, Mt Gox, collapsed after it was reported that it had lost hundreds of millions of dollars in customers bitcoins.\n\nKarpeles can’t leave Japan\n\nAccording to Japanese news outlet, News24, Karpeles paid around $100,000 with the condition that he wasn’t to leave Japan once on bail.\n\nSince the collapse of Mt Gox, Karpeles was reportedly arrested twice last year in connection with the investigation after police suspected that he had embezzled around $3 million of customers money. He was charged last September and was held in a detention house in Toyko until his recent bail release.\n\nThe video from News24 depicts a much thinner Mark Karpeles than the one many are used to seeing; however, with his newfound freedom many will be wondering what exactly the infamous Karpeles will do now.\n\nWhat he’s up to now?\n\nDavid Duccini, information security consultant and serial entrepreneur, said to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Bail is good, so that he’s free to roam, be watched, and caught in the act [of] doing something bad again.”\n\nWhat do you think of Mark Karpeles being released on bail? Do you think he’s turned over a new leaf?', 'At the end of 2014, everyone was telling programmer Felix Weis that Bitcoin was dead.\n\n“I knew it wasn’t true because I used Bitcoin at least once a week in Berlin,” he recalls. (Though originally from Luxembourg, he had been living there for two years.)\n\nAfter hearing about Bitcoin back in 2012, he had since founded a Bitcoin coworking space but there were too few Bitcoin companies to keep it afloat. He was also active in the Bitcoin forums and had written a Python library for Bitcoin.\n\nBut one thought nagged at him. Back when he first heard about Bitcoin, he immediately thought that, if this were truly a “world currency” — one that could be used regardless of what country you were in — someday people should be able to make round-the-world trips using it.\n\n“I thought maybe it would be 10 to 15 years from [then],” he says, but as it turned out, he packed up his bags and embarked on that voyage within two years — on January 12, 2015.\n\nSince then, Weis has been to 27 countries and 50 cities, spending — according to the rules he established — only bitcoin.\n\nHis three stipulations were:\n\nNo banks. And that meant no Western Union, no money exchanges, no converting USD to euros, no euros to yen. Bitcoin first. He had to use Bitcoin whenever possible. Cash only for bitcoin. Recognizing that there would be times when he would need local currency, he allowed himself to do peer-to-peer exchanges of bitcoin for cash. And that led to some fun adventures.\n\nDuring his bitcoin-funded trip, the cryptocurrency underwent a maturation. Undoubtedly, things looked bleak for Bitcoin when Weis departed. For more than a year, the price had been falling after surpassing $1,000 at the end of 2013. In fact, his journey began around the nadir, two days before the price briefly slipped under $200. But over the next year and a half, as Weis visited both Bitcoin-accessible countries like the United States and less Bitcoin-enabled ones like Cuba, the currency steadily regained its footing.\n\nIt began to shed its reputation as the currency of choice for drug dealers and other criminals. Its technology was embraced by the likes of Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq and Visa. It weathered some political infighting that made headlines but ultimately did not drive the new technology, which was being compared to the internet in its significance, off its course.\n\nAnd just as Weis’s trip was coming to a close, the community was anticipating a special event, one set to happen roughly every four years until about 2140. The currency’s unique monetary policy decrees that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, and the amount of new bitcoins (which are released every 10 minutes) would drop by half every four years.\n\nSo, as the community awaited Bitcoin’s second “halving,"" the man who had spent the previous 18 months traveling the world spending only this digital currency returned to Berlin, just in time to attend, on Saturday, a Bitcoin halving party.\n\nHere’s how Weis, 28, survived, what insights he has about Bitcoin and what he learned about the nature of money. (The interview has been edited and condensed.)\n\nHow did you pay for the basics?\n\nTo eat, I went to restaurants listed on Coinmap [a map of businesses that accept bitcoin as payment] even if they were far away. In terms of lodging, I did everything from couch surfing to five star hotels. I paid for all the flights and hotels with Bitcoin. If the hotel didn’t accept Bitcoin directly, I used Expedia, and for the flights, I used CheapAir. I would like to thank these two companies because they helped me a lot.\n\nI’d also like to thank the rest of the Bitcoin community. Without all these Bitcoiners in all these countries, it would not have been possible to do the trip. I did not have a bank account or credit card. Eighty percent of the people I traded with were already Bitcoiners. I found them on LocalBitcoins [a web directory for those who want to meet up in person to exchange local currency for bitcoin].\n\nFor people who didn’t own Bitcoin yet, I told them about it and then they had to get some and we traded that Bitcoin for cash.\n\nWas it hard to convince people to open a Bitcoin wallet?\n\nMost people were interested once I explained some details. It\'s crazy how many people don\'t trust banks anymore. Also, I was a living example that even though bitcoin is a ""virtual"" currency, I could do a ""real"" world tour. But most people don\'t see Bitcoin as a real alternative yet.\n\nWhat did you most often have to use cash for?\n\nAs a deposit for hotels for incidentals because I didn\'t own a credit card. But my cash usage ranged from 80% to 20% depending on the country — in North America, my cash usage was low. In Asia, it was high. South America was in the middle.\n\nWhat were some interesting connections you made through other Bitcoiners?\n\nThe only way I was able to get to Cuba was through a guy advertising that he wanted to buy bitcoin in Cuba. At first I thought it was a joke, but he said, it’s true, I want to get some bitcoin but nobody on this island has any. I asked him, Can I come by and you get me from the airport and I give you some bitcoin and we can trade? And he said, Yes, and you can also stay at my house for a week. So I was able to go to Cuba. But I didn’t find any bitcoin businesses there.\n\nI tipped my guide a few bitcoins after my tour — I set him up with a Blockchain.info wallet and tipped him — but the biggest problem for Bitcoin in Cuba is that it’s pretty much unheard of for private homes to have an Internet connection. The few people who do have internet have it via weird channels. You can buy a wifi card for $2 for an hour, but then the first thing you do, obviously, is chat with your family, not research Bitcoin. And also the socialist wage in Cuba is less than $25 a month, so you cannot buy too many hours of internet with that money.\n\nPreviously, in Switzerland, I had met with the CEO Bitcoin Suisse, who gave me a paper wallet [a wallet containing the keys to one’s bitcoins that cannot be hacked, infected by malware or subject to a hardware crash]. Later, the guy in Cuba asked me how to make a paper wallet, so I handed that over to him. I gave a paper wallet from one of the most capitalistic countries in the world to one of the most socialist countries in the world.\n\nHow did you start your trip?\n\nIn the beginning, I didn’t know how I would pay for stuff and if I would actually find places that accepted Bitcoin, so I had almost 200 euros in cash. For transportation, I bought an Interrail pass to ride the train.\n\nDid you buy it in euros?\n\nNo, I bought the ticket with All4BTC.com where you can put an Amazon link or any other link and they will buy it for you and you pay them in bitcoin — so you can buy anything online that you would buy with a credit card but you pay in bitcoin.\n\nWhere did you go?\n\nThe first stop was Prague, where SatoshiLabs, which produces the Trezor wallet [a hardware device built specifically to store bitcoins], is based. I wanted to get a Trezor to safeguard my newly bought bitcoin, and I wanted to buy it in person to make sure it wasn’t tampered with in the mail.\n\nI put all my savings into bitcoin, which I don’t recommend anybody doing.\n\nHow much was that?\n\nIt was enough to do a one-year world trip without working. I wanted, at the end, to write a book titled Around the World in 80 Bitcoins — I’m semi-joking. During my travels, the Bitcoin price went up [from ~$200 to $640], so it’s hard to know for sure how much I spent.\n\nWas the Trezor the main way you stored your Bitcoin?\n\nI kept my bulk savings in the Trezor and used a mobile wallet for daily expenditures. I would send money from the Trezor to my mobile wallet as needed. I tried a variety of wallets but mostly used Android Bitcoin Wallet, Mycelium and Copay.\n\nWhat would you have done if you had lost your Trezor?\n\nWith some technical know-how it’s possible to restore the private key without the Trezor hardware. It’s complicated but that would have been my backup plan.\n\nDid you meet a lot of Bitcoin startups on your trip?\n\nI interviewed Bitcoin startups all around the world, to get their perspective, like on where do they see Bitcoin in 10 years, but I haven’t published that material — I’m a programmer, not a blogger. People kept telling me, You have to write a blog, but my blog died after one month. It was so much work.\n\nThis trip definitely wasn’t an all-inclusive vacation. I had to do all this research — finding places that would accept Bitcoin, meeting with these Bitcoiners, figuring out where to get cash.\n\nI went to 50 cities. While I know now that it’s possible to travel around the world with Bitcoin, it’s definitely not convenient. When I came home at the end of the day, I wasn’t in the mood to write a blog article.\n\nHow much time every day or week did you spend doing the research necessary to travel using Bitcoin?\n\nBefore I go to a country, the research can take a day, or an afternoon at least. The original plan was 21 countries in 365 days, but I was only at 17 after one year because I was always a bit scared to go to the next country. Once I was in a country, I knew where to buy stuff with Bitcoin, where to find other Bitcoiners, how to get some cash — all that was settled. But each time I went to a new country, especially if they use a new currency, there were always so many uncertainties.\n\nOnce you arrive at the airport or at the train station, how do actually you find someone who wants to trade? Some airports have Bitcoin ATMs, but I think there’s a business model to do more, because after airport security, when people have money leftover, they usually spend it on stupid stuff like perfume. But what if they could put that money into a Bitcoin machine and take that money with them into another country? Then they could use a Bitcoin ATM to take the money out again. They would basically keep their money in the cloud.\n\nHow did you decide on each destination?\n\nI didn’t go to any city that didn’t list a single business on Coinmap or LocalBitcoins. I needed some connection to the Bitcoin community.\n\nWhen I heard about Grexit — even though I had just been in Greece and had moved on to Turkey and Ukraine — I thought, I have to go back. There, the banks were closed for [three weeks] and people were only allowed to withdraw 60 euros. International wire transfers were banned and people didn’t know — are we going to Grexit? Are we going to go back to drachma? Will we get a 30% haircut on our money?\n\nBitcoin ATMs were not bound by the rule to withdraw only 60 euros, so we showed people how to withdraw 120 euros. There was a Greek Bitcoin exchange, so you could wire your money from your Greek bank account, buy bitcoins on the exchange and then withdraw that money from the Bitcoin ATM.\n\nOne woman who was fed up with the situation in Greece had decided to move to the Czech Republic and used Bitcoin to transfer her savings there.\n\nWhile in Greece, I printed some flyers to inform people about Bitcoin and to advertise an upcoming Bitcoin Meetup. I also created a Bitcoin QR code [which enables someone to send you Bitcoin] and put it on a huge sign and we went around with that and got some media attention. We received gifts of more than one bitcoin at this address, which I then donated to Athens’ newly founded Bitcoin Meetup group.\n\nWhat was another of the more significant destinations?\n\nI celebrated my anniversary of traveling for one year on the Yap Islands [between the Philippines and Guam]. These people used, for many centuries, pretty much the largest money in the world. Even though this money is completely analog, it has a lot of similarities to Bitcoin and blockchain [the technology behind Bitcoin].\n\nThe stones are not produced on the island. They’re made from a special limestone that exists only on Palau, more than 200 miles away. The chiefs of Yap went to Palau and didn’t want to return to their wives empty-handed, so they started bringing these stones, and it became the currency of the island. They wanted to get bigger and bigger stones there, but if your stones were too big, your boat could sink. So it was dangerous to transfer these across the ocean with your small boat.\n\nThey were obviously scarce and valuable so you had all these properties that money has — but they were not fungible. So when the owner changed, they didn’t move the stones. They kept them in the same place, and broadcast, through the whole island, This stone is now owned by this person. So, just like in Bitcoin, the transaction was broadcast to the whole network. If you have bitcoins in your phone, they’re not actually in your phone. You have private keys that sign the transaction to move bitcoin to another person but the bitcoins themselves exist only on the blockchain. That was how the Yapese used these stones.\n\nWhen colonial forces arrived, the Germans wanted to trade with these people but they only had gold and silver, and the Yapese were not into these small rocks. The Germans said, We have these huge ships and can transfer any size of stone for you. At the beginning, the chiefs said, That’s a cool idea, but then there were so many stones, there was inflation. The stones weren’t worth anything anymore. So I thought it was an interesting analogy, first to Bitcoin, and then to the inflation of fiat currency.\n\nSpeaking of inflation, you also went to Venezuela, which the IMF predicts will see 500% inflation this year.\n\nI always read about inflation in history and economic books, but I never saw it with my own eyes. I decided to go there even though it’s kind of risky [a recent study concluded it has the highest homicide rate in the world]. Some Bitcoiners there — Giovanni and his son Anderson — heard about my time in Cuba and reached out to me. To get cash, I sent them some Bitcoin and they came back with bags of cash that represented only $100.\n\nThe 100 Venezuelan bolivar bill is the biggest bill they have. They wanted to have a strong currency like the U.S. dollar, so the biggest bill is 100. Four years ago 100 bolivar used to be $30. Now it’s $0.10 [not according to the official government rate, but on the black market]. For two pizzas, I paid 10,000 bolivar — $10 — and it took me one-and-a-half minutes to count the money.\n\nThere, I also met some Ethereum miners [Ethereum is a network similar to Bitcoin, and miners maintain the network for the chance to be awarded new ether, the cryptocurrency of Ethereum]. One of the socialist benefits in Venezuela is that electricity is cheap — they don’t pay the market price. These miners had 1-2 Bitcoin ASIC miners [machines that maintain the Ethereum network and can generate money in the form of ether] on the floor in their homes, not in a big warehouse like we’ve seen of mining machines in China. A lot of miners that are unprofitable in other countries because they pay market price for electricity want to sell their old machines, but nobody except Venezuelans buys them. Since they don’t pay any electricity, they can still make money from them.\n\nEveryone there wants to get hard currency but without tourists and foreign companies, there are no physical dollars in the country. Between each other, people trade bitcoins, because bitcoins don’t lose value and are more stable than their own currency and it is the only way to wire money internationally to their families — though, usually, it’s the other way around. For everything where I wasn’t able to pay in bitcoin directly, Anderson and his dad paid for me and at the end I paid them back in bitcoin.\n\nWhere did you have the easiest time?\n\nThe easiest was when I was in the U.S. In San Francisco, there were so many hostels and restaurants accepting Bitcoin. It was almost too easy. And then with Gyft, you can use buy gift cards with Bitcoin and use the gift cards.\n\nFor me, the question was, Do we need banks? People always say Bitcoin is for banking the unbanked, for the six billion without a bank account, but I think it would be interesting to unbank the rest of us.\n\nAt what moment were you most tempted to cheat?\n\nIn Romania, in the beginning. I had booked the hotel through Expedia and was supposed to meet this local bitcoin guy to trade for cash but he didn’t show up. I couldn’t find any other person to trade with, so I had no cash. I could only eat the hotel breakfast. I stole some apples from there, but other than that I had no money to eat. Those two days were some of the worst.\n\nThen he showed up and said there was some incident in the family and he was so sorry. He bought me dinner and we did the trade. I found out later that, in Romania, there is a Groupon-like site and the owner is a huge fan of bitcoin. So then I bought vouchers with bitcoin and went out to eat with the vouchers.\n\nWhat did your trip teach you about how Bitcoin might develop over the next few years?\n\nThere are a lot of different uses for it. When I was in the Philippines and Hong Kong, people use it to send money to their families with Coins.ph, and Rebit.ph. In Venezuela, they use it to hedge against inflation and to profit from cheap electricity. In San Francisco, I met people interested in the technology. In New York City, in February, people were mostly interested in the speculative aspect of Bitcoin because it was gaining so much in value then. And in Austin, libertarians felt the state was robbing them and was evil and they could protect themselves with Bitcoin. The uses varied, but in the end, that’s not surprising. Bitcoin is just money.\n\nWhat did you learn about the nature of money?\n\nAnything can be money. The people on Yap define these stones to be money. The fungibility and liquidity of the government-issued money or paper bills or credit cards we use every day are so much higher than Bitcoin, but anything could be money as long as the basic properties are met.\n\nIf you take an objective look at Bitcoin, these properties are already met. The fact that I was able to use it in these 27 countries — in every one, I did at least one bitcoin trade or bought something with bitcoin or used it in another way — showed me it’s already a global currency.', ""Mining software companies try to reduce costs of Bitcoin mining meeting the challenge brought about by the cutting in half of the block rewards.\n\nHashflare has joined the list of Bitcoin mining companies that are working out a way to cut the cost of energy needed for their operations.\n\nEnergy supply has been a topical issue of late for mining operations particularly around the halving period as it is a great determinant to ensure a lower operational cost and to maximize profit.\n\nA report says some of the mining companies in parts of China recently met to discuss how to “share power grid and local power resources” as well as other issues such as hydropower, wind energy, power tariff terms, specific mining co-operations.\n\nThe offer of cheap electricity will attract investment from Bitcoin mining companies particularly in in China where roughly 82% of globally-produced hash share is concentrated.\n\nNew products\n\nMining software companies Bitmain has introduced new products including its latest Antminer S9 which has been dubbed the world's most power-efficient Bitcoin miner, into the market to meet the challenge brought about by the cutting in half of the block rewards.\n\nAfter Genesis Mining tested a larger batch of its X11 ASIC, it upgraded all its ASIC X11 clients from one year to two year contracts with a promise to offer them the electricity cost for the second year free of charge\n\nHashflare slashed its energy cost to enable its miners earn more profit.

Calling Bitcoin (Trading View Ticker: BTCUSD) a cryptocurrency can be enough to make most people turn the page in search of a lighter read. However, a quick introduction can help you see how this innovative coin that is now ~7.5 years old has gone from a coder’s coin and known by only a few hobbyists to an asset class in a class of itself.\n\nIs It Time To Take Bitcoin Seriously?\n\nOnly a handful of people have been following Bitcoin since the creator, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced and explained how and why Bitcoin could work first introduced the digital asset on the cryptography mail archive. However, now many people have at least heard of the Bitcoin though few fully grasp the implications of both commerce and financial markets if Bitcoin can hit the proverbial ‘Tipping Point.'\n\nRegardless of whether or not we’ve hit the tipping point, it is worth taking Bitcoin seriously as it has not only stood the test of time, but the technology that is underlying BTC, the blockchain, has garnered the attention of Goldman Sachs, Citibank, JPMorgan, BNP Paribas and many more as the ‘Next Big Thing’ in Financial Markets. Developed markets with some of the most distraught monetary managers like Brazil have recently seen Bitcoin Trading surpass Gold trading per Cryptocoin News.\n\nMake no mistake; some will call Bitcoin a fad who will fade away into the oblivion of Financial Innovation in a similar fate of Adjustable Rate Mortgages, while others will say the Bitcoin has and will continue to change everything. While I lay to closer to the ‘Change Everything’ extreme, it has yet to be fully adopted, and likely will not be fully adopted as a replacement of fiat currency for multiple reasons.\n\nAt the top of the list for reasons a developed economy would refuse to adopt Bitcoin over the local currency is that the global amount of BTC is fixed at 21 million bitcoins, with ~14 million in existence today. That means if the economy is to grow, the government would need to spend less, and save more in order to buy BTC to build the economy or tax citizens on the BTC they hold, which is inherently difficult. However, it would be an unlikely event to see governments willingly give-up the desire to print and tax in hopes of re-election.\n\nHow Can Understanding Bitcoin Help Traders of Spot Gold?\n\nThis section could have easily been titled, how I came to respect Bitcoin. It is hard to say that we’ll look back on the creation of the Bitcoin in the same light as the Guttenberg press or the Internet, it’s fair to say that it inspires the same ‘Animal Spirits’ that causes Gold (CFD: XAUUSD) to go bid when investors look for a haven asset as a store of value.\n\nIt doesn’t appear to be coincidence when that Bitcoin came onto the seen as banks were being bailed out as the initial or genesis block with the first transaction referenced a Times article dated 03/01/2009 titled, ‘Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks.’ A few days later the source code of Bitcoin was released by Satoshi.\n\nEither way, the spirit behind buying gold and buying bitcoin appears to be very similar. In a ‘doomsday scenario’ where you desire an asset to hold value while other fiat-priced assets are plummeting in value, BTC like Gold is ideal for bartering. The difference is that BTC can allow bartering to be done digitally thanks to the blockchain (more on that in a later post for the geeks out there like myself), whereas gold would most likely be bartered face-to-face in the event of an economic collapse.\n\nAs you can see on the chart above, this mutual symbiotic relationship can be seen with an overlay of Gold (CFD: XAUUSD) and BTCUSD.\n\n[Warning: A Bit of Technical Info Ahead]\n\nOne last note before moving on (kudos for reading this far), Bitcoin’s network and maintenance is what sets it apart from fiat currencies, and places it in a similar league as precious metals such as Gold. First, the ledger, known as the blockchain is considered trustless in that it must be verified my multiple nodes called miners that verify, validate Bitcoin transactions. Typically, this is done by a bank, which acts as a one trusted third-party (see opening quote from Satoshi,) whereas Bitcoin utilizes a distributed network of miners to confirm transactions so there cannot be a single point of failure or misuse as we’ve seen with Rogue Traders or Bank Executives cheating out bondholders/ equity holders. Lastly, the base algorithm is cryptographic and is known as an asymmetric encryption that allows public and private keys to validate a transaction that is then validated by the network.\n\nIn this manner, Bitcoin is allowed to act as a digital barter currency without the need for banks and helps to accomplish what Gold has accomplished for millennia by acting as a store of value in bad times and good times, and accepted at all times if the price is right.\n\n[You May Now Turn-Off Your Hard Thinking Cap]\n\nFollowing BTC/USD\n\nLucky you, DailyFX will begin covering Bitcoin. Historically, we’ve covered Bitcoin in relation to sharp price increases in the wake of Brexit or the Eurozone crisis, or the Yuan Devaluation. However, given the correlation of XAUUSD & BTCUSD and the rising popularity of BTCUSD, we felt you’d be interested in learning more about the development of this pseudo-currency / neo-haven asset as it turns toward its awkward growth years of potential adaptability into everyday utilization.\n\nIf you’re interested in seeing price trends of Bitcoin, the best place to keep an eye on these moves throughout the day is the DailyFX Chart Page where you can keep an eye on BTCUSD or BTCEUR if you wish. However, if you’re keeping an eye on BTC trends in the desire to get a better understanding on the price direction of Gold, it’s likely best to look at BTCUSD. Both BTCUSD & Gold (CFD: XAUUSD) are priced in US Dollar so that a big move in the US Dollar can heavily influence both assets.\n\nThank you for your time, and we look forward to providing you with more information on this new type of currency where a desire for haven digital assets and technology meet.\n\nHappy Trading & Please Let Me Know If You Have Any Questions\n\nT.Y."", 'About The Author\n\nJoseph Young is a finance and tech journalist based in Hong Kong. He has worked with leading media and news agencies in the technology and finance industries, offering exclusive content, interviews, insights and analysis of cryptocurrencies, innovative and futuristic technologies.', 'One of the most active companies in the space – sponsoring events, parties, and conferences – Airbitz has sought to put San Diego on the map for tech startups. CEO Paul Puey posted yesterday in a Facebook group called “San Diego Tech Scene” stating:\n\nHi all. Looking for desk space for your startup? We have some desks to rent out at our office in downtown on 4th and K st. Awesome location with a shared rooftop deck. Pet-friendly and close to all public transportation. Only $300 / month with free Wifi, electricity, and coffee. Send me a message if interested.\n\nThe price isn’t that bad, depending on your coffee habit.\n\n“We’re just simply trying to utilize unused space,” CEO Paul Puey told CCN. “We moved into our location as it was a great deal and was big enough to host the meetups and allow us to grow over time. We hoped to share the space with other blockchain related startups but there simply aren’t many others in San Diego. We’ve invited other blockchain related projects to share the space, but they’re simply too early to utilize it. Hence we’re opening it up to any businesses (hopefully tech startups). Ideally we’d love to be the Bitcoin Center San Diego much like the cities of Denver, New York, Montreal, and others have, but it’s simply too early for SD. Hopefully that changes in the future.”\n\nThe company raised $450,000 from Block26, and has been located in two spots in San Diego’s Mid-City and Downtown areas.\n\nThe company provides a Bitcoin wallet and boasts their “edge security” platform. Like many Bitcoin wallets, the company highlights its focus on usability. A CoinDesk article stated the company was targeting “novices” and “evangelists” in the Bitcoin space. The company is also known for its Bitcoin directory and its frequent events for the San Diego Bitcoin community on its dime.\n\nThe wallet provider was founded by Paul Puey, Scott Morgan, Tim Hortoin, William Swanson and Damian Cutillo. Before receiving the $450,000 from Block26, they received $25,000 from Plug N Play Tech Center and joined that firm’s accelerator program.\n\nAirbitz CEO, Paul Puey, speaks at industry events. He has spoken in New Zealand, San Francisco, Denver, LA and Australia. He advocates “for a decentralized future of Bitcoin.”\n\nAn Airbitz wallet was the first to send a Bitcoin transaction to Cuba.

While the country’s all dominant central government is scrambling to shore up the economy by providing stimulus in whatever way it can, there is something going on in the cryptocurrency world that brings to fore Chinese domination of that field. Bitcoin for all intents and purposes now may be a Chinese currency.\n\nFrom libertarian dream to a Chinese currency\n\nWhen it was conceived, Bitcoin was thought to be a libertarian dream.\n\nAs a unit of value it was not controlled by a central authority, it had to be mined like gold and it was pretty much thought to be inflation proof.\n\nHowever fast forward to today and we live in a world where according to Bloomberg, China is ‘home’ to 90 per cent of bitcoin trades and 70 per cent of Bitcoin mining.\n\nAs the article reported, “Chinese miners have leveraged their access to cheap labor, inexpensive electricity and local chipmaking factories to outmaneuver their global peers in performing the complex calculations needed to verify Bitcoin transactions - a service for which they’re compensated in newly-minted bitcoin. When the cryptocurrency’s price tumbled from about $1,000 in late 2013 to below $200 in early 2015, lower costs in China allowed them to stay afloat even as many Western operators folded.”\n\nWhere Power Flows Through The Barrel of a Gun\n\nPerhaps it as an apt time to quote the late Chairman Mao. After all if China is now the king of Bitcoin, they will have their say. Then there is the spectre of government intervention, which is never too far away in China.\n\nTheir media, political activity and of course the internet are all in one way or another under the control of government. Should the Chinese government decide that Bitcoin is a rival or a threat, you might see a massive clampdown in a matter of days.\n\nAs New York Times recently reported in an article titled How China Took Center Stage in Bitcoin’s Civil War, “China’s clout is raising worries about Bitcoin’s independence and decentralization, which was supposed to give the technology freedom from the sort of government crackdowns and interventions that are commonplace in the Chinese financial world.”\n\nThe future of Bitcoin will be shaped by the Chinese\n\nEnough has been written and said about the ‘network congestion’ that clogs the pipeways of Bitcoin world. There is currently many competing ideologies on how this congestion issue should be solved.\n\nWhile the western approach, particularly the American one, has been one that calls for expansion of the network, the Chinese have mostly stuck to the idea that things should stay as they are for the moment.\n\nThe role of the Chinese companies in negotiations over the future of the Bitcoin is immensely important as Wang Chun, co-owner and Chief Administrator of F2Pool told Bloomberg, “The miners control the real voting power”.\n\nIt is important to realise though that while Bitcoin transactions at the moment are capped at 7 per second, if something is not done about the prevailing congestion, the time taken to process these transactions can reach hours or even days, rendering Bitcoin basically inoperational. Therefore some Chinese miners have also realised that something needs to be done.\n\nThe New York Times quoted Jihan Wu, the founder of Bitmain as saying that the network needs to expand and soon. He is known to have said in an email that if core programmers did not increase the number of transactions going through the network by July, he would begin looking for alternatives to expand the network.\n\nEast vs. West\n\nThe Chinese remain sensitive about western impositions and they are not likely to give in to standard ‘talking down’ approach of many western companies and governments.\n\nAt the same time, the concentration of Bitcoin mining in China is a hairy proposition considering what happened in the neighbouring Russia with respect to the Bitcoin ban. With the Chinese economy going through a rough patch, it may reach a situation where an overeager government wanting to impose ever stricter capital controls may come after Bitcoin.\n\nIt is in the interest of Bitcoin and everyone involved that the Chinese and the rest of the world find a new balance where concerns of each other can be taken care of.\n\nIn the event this does not take place, rest assured it would be the Chinese that would be calling the shots this time around.', 'Bitcoin may be a preferred method of payment for a slew of tech-savvy people, but it has yet to take off with the masses, or even micro-masses. iPayYou, the bitcoin wallet, is aiming to change that with a new service launched today (July 14).\n\nDubbed Pay-by-Twitter, iPayYou is the first bitcoin wallet that enables Twitter’s 310 million monthly active users to make peer-to-peer payments over Twitter. With this new service, iPay wallet users can send a payment by simply entering the recipient’s Twitter handle instead of an email or bitcoin address. That means a payment exchange can happen without both parties exchanging private information. According to the company, it marks the first time a service like this is being offered by a full-service wallet.\n\nWith the service, once the payment is sent via iPayYou, a tweet is sent letting the payee know they have received a payment from iPayYou. The tweet includes a link to the iPayYou website for the payee to accept the payment. The payment can be deposited as bitcoin or traded in for U.S. dollars, which will be directly deposited into the user’s bank account.\n\n“Twitter is one of the most widely used social media networks worldwide and despite the speed of technological innovation in the 21st Century, no other full-service bitcoin wallet offered this feature until now,” said Gene Kavner, founder and CEO of iPayYou as well as a former Amazon executive, in a press release. “With the new Pay-by-Twitter feature, iPayYou continues to offer consumers with easy ways to use bitcoin as a payment method in everyday life, which has been our mission from the start.”\n\nAccording to the company, Kavner created iPayYou in response to an “overwhelming need for a simple bitcoin wallet with easy-to-use features and low costs for the everyday consumer.”\n\nTo illustrate how the feature works, when announcing the service iPayYou opted to include the Twitter handles of the three presumptive U.S. presidential nominees. Users can support their candidate by sending money via Twitter.\n\n“We chose to use the presidential candidates as an example of how little information is truly required to send payments over our Pay-by-Twitter feature,” Kavner said.\n\nKavner added that the feature will enable users to pay friends, family members and colleagues, as well as charities.\n\niPayYou’s aim is to simplify the process of paying with bitcoin via its secure and easy to use wallet. The company boasts low transaction fees and claims to be the only wallet that lets users cancel transactions if there are mistakes in the payment process. It also enables customers to send payments through email without the recipient having already created a bitcoin account.', ""The European Commission published a draft directive last week proposing to amend existing anti-money laundering rules to include virtual currencies such as bitcoin. If adopted, exchanges as well as custodial wallet providers will need to collect customers’ identity documents and report suspicious activity on their platform to relevant authorities.\n\nIn an attempt to avoid regulatory overreach, a group of Dutch Bitcoin startups and experts is now reaching out to the Dutch Ministry of FInance offering their expertise, hoping to potentially adjust the proposed directive amendment.\n\nUncertainty still exists over the extent of the proposed directive; in particular over what are considered “wallet providers offering custodial services of credentials necessary to access virtual currencies.”\n\nSome legal experts maintain that the amendment would concern only companies that fully control customer funds (such as Circle or Xapo). Other legal experts think it may also apply to wallet providers that merely hold onto a single key of a multisig-address (such as BlockTrail or GreenAddress); an interpretation that was confirmed by German Bitcoin-news site bitcoinblog.de, which reportedly spoke with an E.U.-representative.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin-services that are not really designed as wallets but do hold private keys (such as ChangeTip and SatoshiPay), may fall under the new regulation as well.\n\nJouke Hofman is CEO of Bitcoin-brokerage Bitonic and exchange BL3P and initiated the outreach to the Dutch Ministry of Finance as well as Dutch Bitcoin-startups and experts.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Hofman explained:\n\n“Under the current provision, it's not that clear who or what the regulation applies to, exactly. It covers wallet providers that hold onto private keys of their users. But does it also include wallet providers that hold onto one key for a two-of-three multisig address? What if bitcoins are time-locked and wallet providers cannot spend the funds now, but perhaps in the future? And if the regulation applies to any key holder, where does the definition of a wallet provider begin? Could the regulation perhaps even apply to Lightning Network nodes? It's important these types of nuances are taken into account when drafting new regulation for an upcoming technology that's still very much in development.”\n\nThis sentiment is shared by Corné Plooy, the main developer behind Amiko Pay, a payment channel network sharing similarities with the Lightning Network. As part of the initiative, Plooy is reaching out to the Dutch Ministry of Finance in hopes of giving them a better understanding of the technological potential of the Bitcoin protocol – and possible consequences of regulatory overreach.\n\nExplaining his perspective to Bitcoin Magazine, Plooy said:\n\n“A major difference between financial technology and other information technology like software or websites is that financial technology usually cannot be deployed without approval of existing parties like banks. I believe this is what stops the financial sector from having the same level of innovation as other IT-sectors. This is where Bitcoin makes a huge difference. It allows for a peer-to-peer economy, without dependence on large organizations. There is no longer a strong separation between the role of a consumer and that of a service provider. Anyone with a good idea and a bit of expertise can make their idea a reality, giving a huge boost to fintech innovation.”\n\nHe continued:\n\n“Regulation may destroy that advantage. What would have become of Google if it had to perform a suspicious activities check on every website it linked to? What will happen to the Lightning Network if every user has to comply with AML/KYC regulations? That is a real concern if multisig key holders are considered wallet providers in the newly proposed E.U. regulations. Privacy concerns aside, individuals don't have the resources to apply these sorts of checks.”\n\nIf the directive is adopted without sufficient provisions for startups and room for innovation, Hofman and Plooy, who are accompanied by representatives from BlockTrail and Bitmymoney, worry it will stifle Bitcoin innovation – or drive that same innovation out of the European Union. They maintain that any regulation targeted at wallet providers should be withheld for now, and they prefer a so-called “wait and see” approach in this domain.\n\n“The core issue is that regulation cannot take into account the advantages or demands of future inventions, because we don't know what those future inventions will be,” Plooy explained. “We need a space where new ideas can be deployed, where they can grow in freedom, so they can prove their use to the world. If the E.U. doesn't provide that space, innovation will happen elsewhere, and Europe will always stay behind.”\n\nOn top of that, the initiative questions whether the proposed regulation will accomplish the stated goals in the first place. In the directive draft, the European Commission argues it needs to impose KYC-checks on the gatekeepers of virtual currencies in order to prevent criminal abuse. But since Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer protocol by design, it's unclear that regulating specific types of wallet services will have any effect in that regard at all, they argue.\n\n“We concede that on- and off-ramps – the exchanges and brokerages where Bitcoin is traded for fiat currency and back – can be considered gatekeepers of the system. We also understand these may need to be regulated to some extent,” Hofman explained. “But this directive proposes to apply full KYC/AML-checks on certain wallet providers. We don't believe these companies work as gatekeepers at all, since anyone can trivially send, receive and store Bitcoin without these companies anyway. They're service providers, sure – but not gatekeepers.”\n\nAs the initiative limits itself to reaching out to Dutch policymakers, Hofman hopes Bitcoin industry players in other E.U. member states undertake similar steps. He has been reaching out to several of them over the past week, suggesting they may want to take action as well.\n\n“In the end, I think it is mostly a lack of understanding of the underlying principles of Bitcoin – and in particular the pay-scripts – that had the European Commission come up with this phrasing,” Hofman said. “But since it is a draft, there are still ways to alter the content. All E.U. member states will have input on the paper, so other European companies that believe the directive needs to be adjusted should contact relevant government officials and perhaps offer them their knowledge. I don't know for sure if this will actually help, but at least we need to try.”\n\nThe European Parliament and the European Council must approve of the directive for it to be adopted. If any adjustments are to be made to the draft proposal, it will need to happen on short notice for regulatory standards: The proposal is scheduled to be enforced by 2017, while the council will discuss the draft as early as next week. Once adopted, E.U. member states are expected to implement national laws based on the directive.\n\nThe author of this article was approached for – and has provided – input to a letter addressed to the Dutch Ministry of Finance drafted by the initiative as well.""]"
07/15/2016,"['Companies around the world are exploring blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currency bitcoin. In this Blockchain unleashed series, the many possible use cases for the blockchain, from the novel to the transformative, are investigated.\n\n\n\nEthereum, a network designed to extend blockchain technology to uses beyond crypto-currencies, has been gaining traction around the world.\n\nBilled as “a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts…without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference,” Ethereum has been enthusiastically embraced by organisations like Microsoft, IBM and Azure.\n\nHow then does the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars get stolen in one day, from an individual account?\n\nThis is the situation that those affiliated with The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) awoke to on June 17 as transactions were made from their Ethereum account to an account whose owner is unknown.\n\nIt was a timely reminder that sometimes “smart” technology acts stupidly. Bitcoin suffered a near-death experience in 2014 when the equivalent of US$450 million in bitcoins went missing after Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy. Ethereum now faces a similar moment.\n\nImportant lessons about the risks, true capabilities and need for better governance of blockchain networks unfortunately have to be learned once again.\n\nHow Ethereum and The DAO work\n\nStarted in 2014 by teenage programming prodigy Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum network is unique for its pioneering use of “smart contracts”. Just like regular contracts, terms and conditions are developed and agreed upon by consenting parties. What makes them supposedly “smart” is that, when the conditions of the contract are met, the contracts execute automatically.\n\nThe DAO is an online, investor-directed venture capital fund built on the Ethereum blockchain network. The DAO’s goal is to collectively channel investment into new projects, similar to the way that crowdfunding works, but using Ether, the crypto-currency that underpins Ethereum. It uses specialised code (based on Ethereum’s Solidity language) to allow its members to execute automated investment decisions.\n\nThe DAO has no single leader, though there is a group of overseers who are elected by holders of special DAO tokens (which people purchase with ether). Voting rights are determined by one’s DAO token holdings.\n\nAfter raising 10.7 million ether (the equivalent of US$120 million in May 2016) in an initial crowdfunding effort, one of the biggest in history, hopes were high for The DAO.\n\nThen, on June 17, crisis struck. An unknown person or group of people funnelled out about one-third of The DAO’s ether holdings the equivalent of between US$45 million and $77 million (the value depends on whether one uses the pre- or post-incident ether market price).\n\nWithin days, the market price of ether crashed around 50 percent. A good deal of soul searching for both projects has been underway ever since.\n\nSmart thieves or dumb programming?\n\nIn the fallout of the incident, much was made about how The DAO was “hacked”. Upon closer examination though, The DAO was not hacked at all. The attacker(s) used two features of The DAO’s specialised code to siphon out ether in amounts small enough to not result in the destruction of their DAO tokens.\n\nMoreover, The DAO’s terms and conditions do not permit theft or fraud. In short, it is perfectly legitimate to do whatever a smart contract’s code permits, even if this is beyond the original intention of those who wrote the code.\n\nLike all technologies, “smart contracts” are dual use and might be used in ways that their creators did not intend. The complexity of the technology only compounds this issue.\n\nWhen considered in this context, not only is what occurred above board (though not in the spirit of The DAO), funnelling money out of The DAO’s account ironically turns out to be a feature, not a bug.\n\nImportant decisions now face the Ethereum community. The fate of the network and the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars hang in the balance.\n\nSensibly, a backstop mechanism was built into the Ethereum network for incidents such as this one. The account holding the (mis)appropriated funds (a so-called Child DAO) has been frozen for 27 days and soon the Ethereum community will hold a referendum of sorts, “voting” on what course of action to pursue. This will determine whether holders of DAO tokens will be able to recoup their lost ether, or see it remained locked in limbo forever.\n\nLessons for blockchain enthusiasts\n\nThis episode introduces nuance to Ethereum’s pitch on enabling applications to run “without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference”. Similar claims are made by the promoters of crypto-currencies and blockchains more generally.\n\nSmart contracts may run exactly as programmed but this does not mean that they will run as the creators intended. The DAO incident demonstrates how the complexity of these contracts is outstripping the comprehension of the people who wish to write them. This in turn introduces bugs and vulnerabilities, some of which are known, but others will only become known when something goes wrong.\n\nWhile the Ethereum network’s users might be decentralised, certain features of the network are not. For instance, the decision as to what changes will be made to the code as a part of the upcoming referendum is determined by a small group of Ethereum developers. The check on this concentration of control is that 51 percent of nodes in the network must agree to the changes.\n\nHowever, a 51 percent threshold is not ideal given the network’s tendencies towards centralisation. The difference between the Ethereum blockchain network vs a referendum is that the former is not “one person, one vote” it is “one node, one vote”.\n\nFor Ethereum, there is no telling how many people control how many nodes. This is because the account holders are pseudonymous. What is known is that the distribution of ether holdings is heavily skewed across accounts. At present, of a total of 440,741 accounts, the top five Ethereum accounts alone possess 25 percent of the total outstanding ether. Moreover, the distribution of mining is also not uniform. Three mining pools currently occupy more than 50 percent of Ethereum’s mining capacity. Amassing 51 percent of the required resources for control becomes relatively easier under such a configuration. For Bitcoin, where votes are determined by the distribution of mining, and mining is similarly distributed, the ability to game the network is even greater.\n\nSmart contracts require smarter governance\n\nIf blockchains are to be sustainable in the long run, serious consideration of appropriate governance mechanisms is needed.\n\nA skewed distribution of mining power and crypto-currency holdings is combined with pseudonymity of account holders and a strong incentive to game the system. This has all the makings for deceptive, unaccountable, fraudulent, and self interested decision making.\n\nUntil hard questions around governance of blockchains are asked, and solutions implemented, we should brace ourselves for more incidents like that which has befallen The DAO. At stake is not just the fate of projects like Ethereum but the future potential of blockchain technology more generally.\n\nBenjamin Dean, Fellow for Cyber-security and Internet Governance, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University. This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.', 'All users play a crucial role in governance, as they are what ultimately gives Bitcoin value. People can choose to be equal under the law of mathematics.\n\nIn its seven years of existence, Bitcoin has gained widespread attention with its disruptive potential in finance. Some see it as a form of digital gold, offering a safe haven against capital controls and asylum to people whose currency is debased.\n\nThe invention of cryptocurrency coincided with a global crisis of legitimacy in the 2008 financial meltdown, which was followed by bank bailouts and for the people, a cycle of austerity. In that seminal white paper, mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto described Bitcoin as a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow ""online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"". The core invention is distributed trust and Nakamoto stated that it was put forward as a solution to the ""inherent weakness of the trust based model"", where financial institutions act as trusted third parties.\n\nBitcoin, I will argue, is not just an innovation in banking and finance, but at its core, concerns a challenge to governance systems that can lead to an evolution of humanity. For so long, social progress has stagnated, with the selfish and callous sides of man taking the upper hand. Unprecedented levels of government and corporate corruption in recent years have signaled a breakdown of systems of accountability. This deep failure of democracy has exposed the existence of individuals who exhibit a total lack of conscience and empathy for others. They embody a dark side of individuality, with aggressive and narrow selfish desires that often come in conflict with the public good. Now, the destructive actions of this minority seem to have become a threat to civilization itself. We shall explore how Bitcoin provides a new model of governance that is resilient to these adversarial forces.\n\nSecurity holes within representative democracy\n\nIn the US, the launch of constitutional democracy brought a significant departure from the monarchy of olden times, where the king acted as ordained ruler. Yet, the foundation of this governance has not fundamentally changed, as it still relies on authority, requiring people to trust those who claim to represent them in the form of elected officials.\n\nRepresentative democracy has increasingly become a mask used by ruthless individuals to hide and gain a grip on the populace. Behind the veil of secrecy, corporate masters behind the charade of electoral politics sponsor political candidates, who with campaign promises keep people passive and manage down their expectation levels. With future faking, which involves making plans that will never happen, and gas-lighting, a tactic known to challenge one’s memory, they deceive and gain power over others.\n\nMoney as a weapon of control\n\nMoney dependent on systems of representation requires trust to work. With the creation of the Federal Reserve and other central banks, private corporations began taking over the supplying of money. This centrally planned money production intermediates human relationship by dividing all into classes of creditors and debtors, where the former are masters, while the latter often become de-facto slaves.\n\nThe hidden captains of this managed democracy direct the flow of currency through financial engineering and have created incentive structures that are bent toward preserving their power. Stimulated by toxic asset bubbles, derivatives and quantitative easing, these incentives work like invisible hands of the market. They suppress democratic values by controlling information, which is the currency of democracy and suppressing free speech with economic censorship, as was seen in the case of the financial blockade against WikiLeaks. With radical deregulation, this system promotes fraud and depravity, exemplified in HSBC’s money laundering and top bank’s currency rigging. Through oppressive monetary policy and predatory lending that is presented as humanitarian aid, institutions such as the IMF and World Bank indebt developing countries, holding whole populations in poverty.\n\nAll of this has resulted in the creation of a two-tiered justice system and derisked capitalism, where those in power are never allowed to fail and are not held accountable either by markets or the legal system.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis and the bailouts of Wall Street banks exposed this big monopoly game and the brazen double standard in these unfair rigged rules. At the onset of the Occupy movement, scholar-activist David Graeber spoke of how people had woken up to the fact that ""money is a political arrangement"" and is ""a social set of promises that people make to one another"". He noted how this crisis revealed that governments treat ordinary people’s debts as sacrosanct with no one allowed to default, while bankrupt bankers are bailed out by those taxpayers, who are then just loaded with more debt.\n\nThis environment can also take advantage of honest entrepreneurs. The CEO of a Taipai-based shipping company, Nobu Su became a victim of this unregulated greed and perversion of free market capitalism. He filed a lawsuit against the Royal Bank of Scotland for losses on swaps. When asked by Max Keiser, host of the popular financial program on RT about a possible solution to this problem, he emphasized the need to timestamp documents so that people can’t change figures, in order to hold these fraudulent activities accountable.\n\nBitcoin as a new security model\n\nBitcoin brings an elegant solution to this systemic parasitic rent-seeking and exploitation. As asset-based digital cash, it offers an alternative to the promissory system of value creation by decree from above. Currency is its first application and Bitcoin\'s underlying technology, the blockchain is a public asset ledger. This is a distributed database that records a history of transactions in the network without anyone in charge. Once data is verified, no one can undo it. This immutable timestamp goes beyond simple accounting of monetary transactions.\n\nBitcoin enables a new security model and it addresses the problem of security holes in the existing trust-based model of governance. Author and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos called this ""trust by computation"" that has ""no central authority or trusted third party"". He explained this form of trust as follows:\n\nTrust does not depend on excluding bad actors, as they cannot ‘fake’ trust. They cannot pretend to be the trusted party, as there is none. They cannot steal the central keys as there are none. They cannot pull the levers of control at the core of the system, as there is no core and no levers of control.\n\nWith this trust by computation, the need to trust institutions or central authorities is replaced with mathematics. Human trust is easily exploited by those prone to act with little concern for others. In the Bitcoin network where there is no point of control, attackers cannot fake trust. In order to gain control over the network, they would have to compromise math.\n\nPower corrupts, and the best way to check and balance power is to not have these points of control in the first place. Thus, decentralization is a natural progression of security models. In a decentralized system, there is no ladder of power that can be climbed to exploit others. Through distributing trust across a network and minimizing the necessity to trust a third party, the system removes the vulnerability that often leads to such concentration of power.\n\nRule of algorithmic consensus\n\nSo, how does Bitcoin distribute trust and secure this peer-to-peer network? Instead of top down rules, Bitcoin is governed by a consensus mechanism called proof-of work. Bitcoin’s particular consensus algorithm reverse-engineers the current financialization scheme. Through using bitcoin as a token of value with a combination of cryptographic hash functions, game theory and economic incentives, a whole new economy is now being created. Bitcoin mining is the heart of the system. It is a broadcast math competition engaged by a network of computers around the world with clear rules, including the total number of bitcoin created, a predictable issuance rate and automatic adjustment of mining difficulty.\n\nBy using precious resources, miners work to solve difficult mathematics problems. Each 10 minutes, problems are solved and whoever solves the problem first wins a fixed number of bitcoins. This process leads to both creation of money and clearing of transactions and it is designed to create economies of scale, with rewards proactively incentivizing all to follow the network rules of consensus.\n\nWhat makes the global Bitcoin heart beat and its ecosystem thrive is not just miners and developers, but everyone’s participation in the network. This includes merchants, investors, entrepreneurs and users. Journalist Aaron van Wirdum describes how full nodes that relay and validate transactions within the network check and enforce Bitcoin’s consensus rules. He explains how ""not all full nodes are equal from a network perspective"". The full nodes that miners, companies and developers run ""all add weight to a set of consensus rules"". Yet, he emphasizes how all users play a crucial role in governance, as they are what ultimately gives Bitcoin value.\n\nBy removing third parties, the inventor of this technology found a way to create a direct feedback loop among all participants, aligning the balance of supply and demand with the force of consensus, which is more democratic than the current oligarchic system that operates under a pretense of democracy.\n\nIn the current financially engineered market, monetary supply does not correlate with the real demands of people. Yet, with this new Bitcoin market, monetary supply is created through real demand with the feature of infinite divisibility (bitcoin can be divided into 8 decimal points and more if consensus is reached).\n\nThe only way miners and developers get paid for their work is to be on the side of consensus, so they are incentivized to respond to the demands of users. Instead of pumping money like a central bank printing press, this globally stretched heart is a receptive organ. It listens to the impulse to transact freely that comes from everywhere and the network self-regulates to develop its own immunity against both internal and external attacks.\n\nHonest account of the darkness within\n\nIn these new cryptographic systems, attempts to cheat the system could manifest in covert chip fabrication, spam attacks and miners colluding in a mining pool to earn more than their fair share at the expense of honest miners.\n\nYet, the genius of this protocol is in the ability for a math-based network to enforce rules of consensus and fair play. At its foundation is Satoshi. The Chinese character of his name in Japanese is translated as history of philosophy. This philosophy is like wisdom gained through history; an understanding of the contradiction inherent in man as a being both corruptible as well as perfectible. This is at the crux of Bitcoin’s game theory. Instead of naively assuming good intentions in everyone, the creator of this technology expected that some would try to cheat and attack the network. This expectation is shared by developers who are committed to Satoshi’s vision of this particular security model. At the Hong Kong Scaling Bitcoin conference, developer Andrew Poelstra explained the mindset that Bitcoin lives in an adversarial environment and that the possibility of individuals acting selfishly and taking advantage of others’ good will needs to be factored into designing its governance.\n\nBitcoin core developer Peter Todd also emphasized the necessity of adversarial thinking. In a Twitter interaction on the topic of security, Todd noted, ""security isn’t about people promising they won\'t do something, it\'s about people being unable to do something"".\n\nWhen greed and self-interests are condemned or denied, these aspects do not disappear, but are simply pushed out of sight and kept hidden. Efforts through law enforcement to regulate and punish selfish actors can just make them more cunning and deceitful. Bitcoin’s security model is based on honest accounting of selfishness in our genes. Instead of trying to shun the darkness, it finds a way to bring what is often hidden in society out in the open and work with it.\n\nIncentive structure\n\nWith this ability to think like an attacker, market forces are used to create a new law that can bring accountability without relying on the moral strength of any individual or external moral authority. Robert Wolinsky, senior manager of blockchain research, explains how ""Satoshi introduces a cost equation to cheating/collusion via the proof-of-work protocol"", making it clear to parties what the cost of attacking the network is and having them pay for it upfront. Furthermore, by making the rewards for playing by the rules higher than the value of attacking the network, it can proactively protect the system from the lack of impulse control of those who are instinctively programmed to act ruthlessly.\n\nBitcoin mining reintroduces risk into the market. Here, concrete rewards are used to channel risk-taking and self-serving inclinations, making all compete for honesty and truth. The competitive drive of survival of the fittest, fueled by this global math contest does not create ruthless bloodbaths or make a killing on the back of someone’s misery, but instead is guided to serve the whole network. The fire of hashing power burns aggressive and violent parts of our humanity, transforming them into generating global level security for all.\n\nGovernance without central authority\n\nOver the decades, democratic governments have become vehicles of control that have lost their fail-safe. Increasingly, people are held hostage by this corrupted political system. Satoshi’s white paper published in 2008 cleared a path for evolution. This wisdom can help humanity solve the problem of a historic failure of accountability.\n\nBitcoin ungoverns people as well as unbanking them around the world. Proof-of-work distributes what used to be third party trust across a massive global decentralized network, fostering a kind of self-governance in each individual. People who till now have been blindly handing over their consent to institutions can instead choose to be equal under the law of mathematics.\n\nGovernance without central authority can at first seem inefficient. But it is more secure than the current system of representation. The more the system reduces the need to trust a third party, replacing it with a borderless network, the lower the security risk becomes. With Bitcoin, governance can be innovated to function as a platform of consensus. Rather than a system to govern others, it can be used as settlement; to work out disputes and reconcile conflicts. Distributed trust as its core technology enables the capacity to set up rules agreed to by everyone, which cannot be altered by one person or group. The Bitcoin blockchain opens a door into a pluralistic society where all can participate in creating governance models and currencies that manifest their values through the principle of mutual aid and voluntary association.\n\nAs Bitcoin gains more value, proof-of-work becomes a lightening rod, attracting malicious attackers. Now, a new civilization is emerging, one that does not try to enlighten others, but emanates light from out of our own darkness within. Man is fallible and each person alone can’t account for themselves. But through our genuine efforts of working together, a spark can be created that shines on a path toward freedom. Each 10 minutes, the heart of the Bitcoin network expands, time-stamping out greed and antisocial impulses, while confirming our altruistic nature. Through a network of consensus built upon this virtue of selflessness, humanity that once was known as killer apes can now become a species capable of love.', 'Steemit announced on their website that they were hacked.\n\nThe attack, according to them, has compromised about 260 accounts. A little less than US$ 85,000 worth of Steem Dollars and Steem are reported to have been taken by the attackers.\n\nIn the security announcement CEO of Steemit Ned Scott said:\n\n“User accounts and wallets are not at risk, and we hope to soon reactivate the Steemit website to normal order. Any users whose accounts were compromised will be completely reimbursed.”\n\nLaw enforcement informed\n\nAt the moment it appears that the virtual currency itself has not been compromised but only the Steemit website has had issues. Steemit have informed their partner exchange Bittrex, who are helping with the investigation of the hacking incident. Steemit have also informed authorities including the police and the FBI of the hack.\n\nWhat is being done\n\nSome hours later Steemit have released another statement which says that they have been able to coordinate elected witnesses to secure compromised accounts which have balances of more than US$ 100. Ned Scott the CEO further states that:\n\n“Within the next 48 hours, Steemit will begin to allow all newly secured accounts to reset their passwords simply by logging in with the same Facebook or Reddit credentials that were used to register in the first place. This easy process will work for the vast majority of the potentially compromised accounts. All of these account holders will regain full access to their funds and their original account name.”\n\nRefund for users\n\nBittrex, on their part, temporarily suspended deposit and withdrawal of Steem and Steem Dollars at their exchange.\n\nSteem has asked its users to contact their support team at [email protected] if their account was not created through facebook or reddit.\n\nFor the users that used their social networking Ids to create the account, they will be able to login using the same credentials they originally used within 48 hours.\n\nIt is expected that most users will be able to regain full access to accounts and funds. Steem it is advising their users to reset account passwords. Ned Scott in his communique has assured users again that “Any Steem or Steem Dollars stolen from compromised accounts will be fully refunded by Steemit.”', 'iPayYou, a Seattle-based bitcoin payment platform, is rolling out a new service that allows anyone with a Twitter account to send and receive Bitcoin payments, without providing any private information.\n\nAnyone using the “Pay-by-Twitter” tool can send bitcoins by entering the recipient’s Twitter handle (rather than an email or bitcoin address).The tweet contains a link to the iPayYou website where the recipient can accept the payment and deposit it as a bitcoin or trade it in for U.S. dollars.\n\niPayYou hopes Pay-by-Twitter will attract a broader user base for bitcoins. So far, the market for the crypto-currency has been fairly niche.\n\n“Twitter presents a unique opportunity for iPayYou customers,” said CEO Gene Kavner. “Hundreds of millions of customers already use and know Twitter very well; they’re familiar with the process of logging into Twitter and interacting with their favorite content publishers. At the same time, Twitter is also unique because it is a massive social network that allows any user to hide their personally-identifiable information from other users.”\n\nKavner believes the Twitter tool will have a wide range of applications, from charitable donations, to peer-to-peer payments — even political contributions. Pay-by-Twitter allows users to send money to anyone with a Twitter handle, even if the recipient isn’t expecting payment. That’s why Kavner thinks it will be a useful tool for donations to causes.\n\niPayYou plans to integrate “all the most popular social platforms” to facilitate bitcoin payments, according to Kavner.', 'Bitcoin price is likely to rise in coming days, so watch out.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been relatively stable since the halving, that was the second time in history when the rate at which new Bitcoin are produced was halved.\n\nSpeculation seems not to be having its way this time but a natural course in the utility of Bitcoin in different parts of the world which is setting itself in to give the top digital currency the value it is currently experiencing.\n\nA report says a pennant trading pattern commonly used by equity analysts has emerged on the digital currency’s chart—and it suggests that prices are poised to shoot even higher.\n\nCombined with the halving, and the growing media coverage of Bitcoin-related issues by popular mainstream media - most certain that you’ll agree that so much has changed in that regard, below are additional events and trends that will likely improve the uptake in the use and price of Bitcoin in coming days.\n\nJapan and South Americans’ involvement\n\nThere’s been a growing interest in Bitcoin from the Japanese and South American markets of late. Aside Coinbase finding its way into the Japanese market in an historic partnership move with one of the country’s largest banks, a first of its kind since the Mt Gox experience in 2013, higher 24 hour trading volume has been recorded in Japan with Bitflyer topping the chart according to coinmarketcap.com leaving Bitfinex and others behind.\n\nIn South America, the launch of Colbitex in Colombia and the rising inflation crisis in Venezuela, as well as the growing use of the currency in Brazil, according to coin.dance are some of the factors that created the necessary awareness for Bitcoin in the region.\n\nThe Swiss Vontobel effect\n\nThe introduction of the Vontobel certificate on Bitcoin in USD as a classic tracker certificate (SSPA: 1300) that offers investors a simple means of investing in Bitcoin come July 15 is likely to push the price up.\n\nThe established Swiss bank is giving investors who expect a positive development in the Bitcoin price the opportunity to trade transparently on the SIX Swiss Exchange for the first time, trading the Vontobel certificate on the secondary market i.e. buying or selling at the applicable bid/offer prices. This will be an historic addition to the Bitcoin community especially considering the bank’s 22 international locations and its record as one of the best at identifying and analyzing trends, and subsequently creating innovative investment strategies and products around them.\n\nItaly/EU zone’s financial status\n\nUnless something drastic is done, a pending crisis in the EU’s financial sector will see Bitcoin’s adoption surge in no time. The International Monetary Fund said economic growth in Italy, the eurozone\'s third-largest economy, wasn\'t expected to return to the levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis until the mid-2020s when other economies in the euro currency area would have grown 20 percent to 25 percent larger.\n\nIn its Italy report released on Tuesday, it cut its growth estimate for the country, expecting GDP to expand by less than one percent in 2016 from an earlier forecast of 1.1 percent. The IMF urged Italy to launch urgently needed economic reforms to accelerate growth and head off a looming crisis in its financial industry as ""risks tilted to the downside"" including financial market volatility, the refugee surge, and headwinds from the slowdown in global trade.\n\nFigures suggest a remarkable 17% of bank loans in Italy are bad – that’s over £300bn of bad credit hence the recent market volatility – triggered by the UK referendum decision – has hit European banks hard and Italian banks harder. Italy and Portugal have not recovered from the 2010-12 European debt crisis, while Greece remains in a perilous situation.\n\nLast Thursday, Italian Prime Minister admitted that the core risk for Europe is not just the Italian banking sector but the biggest bank of all in Europe: Deutsche Bank.\n\n""If this non-performing loan problem is worth one, the question of derivatives at other banks, at big banks, is worth one hundred. This is the ratio: one to one hundred,"" Matteo Renzi said.\n\nOn Monday July 11, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank, David Folkerts-Landau, called for a multi-billion dollar bailout for European banks adding that the decline in bank stocks is only the symptom of a much larger problem, namely a fatal combination of low growth, high debt and a ""dangerous"" deflation.\n\nGermany has resisted the urge to support a bailout. This is likely to change though as the disaster looming could be worst.\n\nAccording to what Economics professor Guillaume Vuillemey from the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Paris (HEC Paris) told Radio Sputnik France, there are several issues facing banks in Italy and other areas of the Eurozone. Apart from funding, he said the second question to be asked is: Who is supposed to give it to them?\n\n“Here there are two possibilities: either the EU, or the (national) government), or the markets themselves. It is clear that today capitalization from the market is preferred, not from the government. There have to be stimulatory measures so that shareholders buy more securities and they, not taxpayers, take on the risks of banking assets.""\n\nOn another note\n\nIf we go by the words of Clif who makes “future forecasts via radical predictive linguistics from the slightly tilted planet seen from deck of kayak” Tuesday July 12 should be the day a 16-day rise in the price of Bitcoin should start moving from a $688 range to $1000 per BTC.\n\nWe’ll see how it all goes. In the meantime, you can add yours.', 'SolidX Partners Inc., a company that specializes in blockchain-based identity services, has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the SolidX Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will provide shareholders exposure to the daily change in the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin, minus expenses and liabilities of the trust, as measured by the TradeBlock XBX Index.\n\nThe trust will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “XBTC,” the company announced on its website. It will not be actively managed.\n\nThe SolidX Bitcoin Trust follows the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust bitcoin ETF, which filed with the SEC in 2014, and recently filed to switch its listing from Nasdaq to BATS Global Markets.\n\nETF To Utilize XBX Index Price\n\nThe SolidX Bitcoin Trust will utilize the XBX Index price to determine the daily net asset value, providing stakeholders with an accurate and reliable benchmark for the price of bitcoin. Once approved, shares of the SolidX Bitcoin Trust will list and trade on NYSE Arca, the exchange for the largest gold ETF, the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD).\n\nAn electronic version of the SolidX Bitcoin Trust registration statement can be accessed through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\n\nTradeBlock’s XBX Index has become the leading institutional reference rate for the price of bitcoin, and is designed to serve the needs of ETF traders and providers. The index value is a live rate calculated once per second based on trading activity on bitcoin exchanges.\n\nThe XBX Index weighs the most liquid exchanges more heavily to maximize replicability of the index rate in live spot markets. It algorithmically discounts price deviations caused by market anomalies and manipulation attempts in real time.\n\nThe XBX Index governance protocol and calculation methodology are based on the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks, which further ensure the unbiased nature and reliability of the reference rate. More than $100 million of derivative assets rely on XBX as the benchmark reference rate.\n\nBitcoin Companies Tap XBX Index\n\nSolidX Bitcoin Trust’s adoption of TradeBlock’s SBX Index continues the accelerating adoption trend by bitcoin companies. The index also serves as the reference rate for Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, the first publicly-traded bitcoin investment vehicle; Chainalysis, a provider of compliance services and tools; BitGo, a bitcoin wallet provider; Rebit.ph, a bitcoin-based remittance provider; various cash-to-bitcoin ATM network operators; private funds and software companies.\n\nTradeBlock XBX Index also serves as the benchmark rate for thousands of bitcoin in daily over-the-counter spot trading on the TradeBlock Professional platform.\n\nFor further information about the TradeBlock XBX Index, visit https://tradeblock.com/markets/index.\n\nAlso read: ETF ‘Spider Woman’ gets behind BTC ETF\n\nSolidX Partners Debut Identity Solution\n\nSolidX Partners recently launched a solution it characterizes as the world’s first full-stack identity solution using blockchain technology. Called Vida, the solution provides enterprises with identity management capabilities without having to hold personal identifying information. Vida provides one identity across numerous applications, streamlining permissioned access to services and data without shared-secret based access mechanisms such as passwords, usernames and ID numbers.\n\nVida utilizes the blockchain as a distributed key server, removing risks associated with centralized key storage. The platform provides an additional layer of security by leveraging a unique, three-party authentication methodology to eliminate “man-in-the-middle” attacks.\n\nBy decentralizing risk and enabling secure recordkeeping, Vida improves corporate security and simultaneously empowers users with better control over usage, establishment and protection of personal identifying information across platforms.\n\nVida enables time stamping, file fingerprinting, authentication, credential verification, storage, email verification and document signing.

Gallancy, chief executive officer of SolidX Partners. “Vida’s use of the blockchain enables a level of security not possible in the past.”\n\n“We look forward to supporting enterprises in improving security and eliminating the liabilities associated with centralized recordkeeping,” Gallancy continued. “Vida’s blockchain-based identity system creates value for enterprises, customers and employees without compromising privacy or control of personally identifying information.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoiners love to believe their complicated version of money will win hearts and minds. But they might be overlooking one crucial aspect – most people don’t even understand traditional finance, let alone the uber complicated digital finance of the future.\n\nAlmost two thirds of Americans can’t calculate interest payments. Yet, Bitcoiners believe their complicated digital currency, which incorporates encryption and deflation, will catch on and “revolutionize” finance.\n\nA new study released today determined nearly two-thirds of Americans would fail a basic financial literacy test.

A blockchain is the kind of distributed, online database that powers bitcoin and and all virtual currencies. Advocates for these technologies point out that blockchains have many non-financial uses (as we have previously reported) that regulators should ignore for now.\n\nPerianne Boring, president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said in a statement, “North Carolina anticipated key issues, and developed a reasonable solution to address each concern. This has paved the way for other states to realize and embrace the incredible potential of these technologies.”\n\nIt isn’t the first state to move on bitcoin. Here’s what we know about states that have updated their rules or laws to address businesses grounded the internet’s native money:\n\nOregon may have passed the first new law , which went into effect in May 2015, regulating bitcoin exchanges as money transmitters.\n\nNew York created its BitLicense, using existing authority, which became effective last August. According to a Department of Financial Services spokesperson, 26 firms have sought a BitLicense . Only two have received one (though two others are also permitted to conduct business in cryptocurrencies by meeting a higher bar, as trusts). Several bitcoin companies shut down operations in the state in response to BitLicense, and a few of those set up a protest website, PleaseProtectConsumers.com .\n\nSeveral states have issued guidances (meaning that the authorities there are operating under a memo, until something more formal is needed). These documents tend to treat bitcoin exchanges as money transmitters, provided they meet certain conditions. These states include Kansas , Texas and South Dakota .\n\nMany others are still simply studying the issue, a stance we’ve confirmed via email with spokespeople in Colorado, Maine, Nebraska, Virginia and Kentucky. Pennsylvania also appears to be taking this position, based on a 2014 issue of the Department of Banking’s newsletter (in which it also explains that, from a legal perspective, bitcoin isn’t money).\n\nA cryptocurrency think tank in D.C., Coin Center, has also been tracking relevant rules and laws as they develop. It’s identified a number of states with legislation before state lawmakers.\n\nCalifornia got a piece of virtual currency legislation through one chamber, and the legislative offices behind it hoped to send a bill to the governor that would draw less ire from entrepreneurs than New York’s BitLicense has. “We looked at it as a model of things we would not want to do,” Mark Farouk, chief consultant to the California Assembly’s Banking and Finance Committee told the Observer in a phone call. Mr. Farouk helped State Assembly Member Matt Dababneh draft AB 1326, a virtual currency bill that was ordered “inactive” in the Senate last fall.\n\nNew York’s BitLicense is unique in the country because it “has state-level anti-money laundering requirements,” Coin Center’s Jerry Brito wrote.\n\nFedCoin: when the government copies bitcoin\n\nThe USA PATRIOT Act sought to undermine terrorists by forbidding financial firms to serve anonymous customers. Rules preventing such practices are referred to as know your customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML). “Historically, AML is a function of the Federal not the State government,” Brito wrote. The author of Mastering Bitcoin, Andreas Antonopoulos has called these rules “dangerous.”\n\nOther companies have defended New York. “We’re on the side of pro regulation,” Jesse Chenard, the CEO of MonetaGo told the Observer in a phone call. “We don’t think that bitcoin itself can be regulated or anything ridiculous like that but we do think that the gateways can be regulated and they should be.” MonetaGo is one of the companies that’s still waiting for a decision on its BitLicense application.\n\nFor states that want to move forward, the Uniform Law Commission has draft legislation to start from. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors has a model regulatory framework (which South Dakota uses as its guidance). Coin Center also has a framework.\n\nBitcoin put value on the internet in a native way. American law hasn’t adjusted to money that isn’t sovereign yet. Each state regulates the money business in slightly differently and they are all balancing the nascent industry’s maturity versus the need to write rules for it.\n\nAfter all, the world’s bitcoin has a market capitalization of less than $11 billion, roughly one third the GDP of the state of Vermont, the country’s smallest. Virtual currency will not make or break the American economy just yet. No need to rush.', 'A hacker group that calls itself “Pravvy Sector” is trying to extort the government of Poland for $50,000 in traditional money or bitcoin, with the threat of releasing stolen data from the country’s Defense Ministry.\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nPravvy Sector or “Right Sector”, a hacking group that – as its name implies – has far-right leanings is threatening to release data it purportedly stole from Poland’s Defense Ministry.

As reported by Softpedia, they ‘leaks’ include several document scans, an Excel file that contained nearly 1,5000 entries of local intranet logs from the Defense Ministry network and more.\n\nIn a statement, the Ministry confirmed that the data breach had indeed affected its database.\n\n“In connection with the information on hacking of the Defence Ministry’s database, [we] clarify that it was a manipulation to create the impression of a dangerous cyberattack,” the ministry stated, according to SputnikNews.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.', ""Some banking software is so old that programmers have had to come out of retirement to fix glitches in the code and integrate it into mobile phone device interfaces. That’s if the banks could find the poor guy, who's probably out fishing somewhere, or if he’s still alive.\n\nYet banks haven’t wanted to invest in from-scratch, well-documented re-engineering. It’s too expensive—bankers prefer to count money than spend it—and it’s difficult to justify a new back end to owners because code is so invisible. Banking code has thus stagnated and gotten patched when necessary, or possible, despite fraud and cyber theft.\n\n+ Also on Network World: What is blockchain and how does it work? +\n\nA modern, safe operating system designed specifically for banks that promises to end theft, along with resulting reputation damage, and costs a lot less would be a solution stakeholders might go for, though.\n\nVault OS, a blockchain technology that recently emerged out of stealth, promises to fix all of banking’s tech problems by running scalably in the cloud, thus ending central points of failure; being consequently cheaper; and operating a highly secure, real-time ledger using cryptography à la Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin’s system of peer-to-peer transactions occurs directly between users electronically rather than through a bank. Bitcoin transactions are verified by the network and are documented in a cryptographic publicly available ledger known as the blockchain.\n\nVault OS is using “private blockchain-style technology,” says ThoughtMachine, the U.K.-based developer, in a press release.\n\nThe benefits to banks could be significant.\n\nEliminating the need for traditional bank data centers\n\nEmployee-reducing scalability is obtained through use of the cloud rather than data centers, the company claims. That cloud-focus “enables a bank to scale from one customer to tens of millions,” it explains.\n\nCosts are kept down in part because the banks don’t need people to run the data centers. And the fact that the solution is brand-new, means banks don’t need software engineers to “keep legacy systems from failing,” further reducing costs, ThoughtMachine says.\n\nThe company claims its blockchain product is future-proof, too, because it uses machine learning to help banks develop new products. They can “roll out new ones in days,” it says.\n\nAll of the transactions are recorded in real time, unlike the overnight appearance that it can take for a customer to see transactions appear on ledgers in traditional banking.\n\nThis should help with compliance issues, ThoughtMachine says. “Within seconds of, say, a customer swiping a credit card,” the transaction appears on the bank’s balance sheet. So a bank, or indeed a customer, should always know its financial position in real time.\n\nIt’s the Bitcoin-technology, blockchain nature of Vault OS that’s revolutionary. That’s primarily because of those transactional improvements over traditional ledgers.\n\nA challenge: The public's perception of Bitcoin\n\nOne of the problems that model Bitcoin has had is that, in the public’s eye, it has been unable to separate the transactional system improvements—where the cost of sending money is one or two electrons, rather than an entire building full of people—from the speculative element. That’s where someone gets a Bitcoin, and it goes up or down in value, creating millionaires or the penniless.\n\nIf one thinks of blockchain technology for banks, not in Bitcoin terms and its media-hyped wealth creation, but purely in terms of transactions, Vault OS makes a lot of sense.\n\nBut it also prompts the question: If all one is doing is cryptographically passing electrons back and forth, what do you need banks for anyway? In the case of Vault OS, has the horse not already bolted?""]"
07/16/2016,"['An event anticipated in the bitcoin community for years came and went last week with little fanfare and, a week later, little impact.\n\nAt approximately 12:48 EST, the 420,000th block on the bitcoin blockchain was mined and sealed by F2Pool, one of the largest bitcoin pools, earning its members 12.5 BTC. This marked the second halving, and the first time a miner would receive the reduced subsidy.\n\nProgrammed into bitcoin\'s code, a halving event is when the subsidy for miners securing the network is cut in half. When bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto first released bitcoin, miners earned 50 BTC per sealed block. Three-and-a-half years later, or 210,000 sealed blocks, that reward was automatically cut in half.\n\nThis cut in the subsidy is bitcoin\'s way of controlling the total supply of currency that will ever be released. When the last bitcoin is released in 2140, there will be a total of 21m total bitcoin in the market, though many will not be in circulation due to loss.\n\nHeading into the event, there were predictions on what would happen, with some speculating that the price would drop immediately after to others suggesting worst-case scenarios.\n\nBut what has become clear, at least in the first week after halving, is that halving was just another day for bitcoin.\n\nPrice unaffected\n\nOne of the primary expectations leading up to halving was that the price would drop due to an expected rumor-and-event cycle, whereby traders would accumulate the asset, riding the excitement up until the actual halving took place, at which point they would exit positions.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, the director of operations at WhaleClub, for example, predicted that the smart money – institutions, professional traders, and other knowledgeable bitcoin traders – would sell their bitcoin holdings at the event.\n\nThe day before halving, the price of bitcoin dropped by close to 10%, from $674 to $618, according to CoinDesk’s USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). While slightly premature to the actual event, this could have been a sign of that event-based selling.\n\nYet, since the halving, the price has been in a tight trading pattern between $637 and $673 per bitcoin, or 5% fluctuations.\n\nOne possible explanation is that the smart money believes the price of bitcoin is going to go even higher, and that the new supply to the market is being bought, offsetting any sales by the smart money.\n\nTerrence Thurber, founder of Oregon Mines, originally told CoinDesk that he believed the price could reach as high as $900, double the $445 bitcoin had been hovering around prior to the massive run-up in June.\n\nHe said:\n\n“The price of bitcoin after the halving would normally be expected to rise as decreasing supply meets increasing demand.”\n\nIf 25 BTC is being released into the market every 10 minutes at $660 per bitcoin and the price stays constant, the demand is also 25 BTC every 10 minutes. If the price continues to stay relatively constant after halving, with the number dropped to 12.5 BTC, miners were either not selling all of their coins when they were receiving 25 BTC, or the smart money is selling, offsetting the cut in new supply.\n\nA similar behavior occurred when bitcoin last halved on 28th November, 2012, when the price was $12.35. The price increased by approximately a $1 over the next month, a relative calm despite the predictable nature of the approaching halving. However, by January, the price was beginning to increase until it peaked at approximately $230 on 9th April.\n\nWhile the price of bitcoin is always in flux, the immediate response to halving was for the price to stay relatively stagnant.\n\nHashrate stays constant\n\nWhile price proved stable, bitcoin miners were more immediately impacted.\n\nWhen Antpool sealed the 419,999th block, it received a 25 BTC subsidy, valued at approximately $16,250 at the time of the block. Only a few minutes later, when F2Pool sealed the 420,000th block, it earned 12.5 BTC, valued at approximately $8,125.\n\nMiners effectively saw their revenue cut in half, which was to be expected. But the anticipated outcome was for the hashrate to drop significantly as well. And while it did drop, from 1,600 petahash/second to a little under 1,400 petahash/second, this is well within the fluctuation of hashing power over the past few months.\n\nMarco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, told CoinDesk that efficiency is what matters for bitcoin mining.\n\nHe explained:\n\n""For us, the halving didn\'t surprise us at all. We were prepared for that event to happen. The most important rule for mining is still: \'If you are the most efficient miner you will be able to continue mining while others need to step out leaving you a bigger share of the pie.\'""\n\nFurther, even with a revenue drop from $16,250 to $8,125, revenues were still nowhere near as bad as they had once been when the price of bitcoin hovered in the range of $200-$300 through much of 2015.\n\nAccording to data collected from Blockchain.info, revenue from mining was lower than today’s levels from January 2015 to November 2015, with some periods where it rose above today’s daily revenue of $1.07m. During that time, bitcoin\'s hashrate continued to increase from approximately 300 PH/s to 500 PH/s in the same time period.\n\nBut, mining has evolved considerably since that time.\n\nAt the start of 2015, miners were still deploying 28nm chips, such as what was found in Bitmain’s Antminer S3, which provided approximately 450GH/s of hashing power per device. Today, Bitmain has its S9, which provides 14TH/s of hashing power per device.\n\nPoint being, the hardware that miners use today is far more efficient than it has ever been before, making it possible for miners to earn a return on investment even when revenue gets cut in half.\n\nEric Mu, CMO at HaoBTC, a mining firm with 5.5% of the hashrate, explained that the vast majority of the cost for the miner was in the actual hardware. Now that they own that, so long as the electricity is cheap, profits can continue to be made.\n\nUltimately, any miner that was able to survive earning between $5,000 to $7,500 per sealed block (when bitcoin traded in the $200-$300 range) back in 2015, earning $8,125 is still better. For those that couldn’t stomach revenues that low, they likely dropped off back in 2015.\n\nBitcoin survived\n\nBitcoin has now experienced two halving events, which, theoretically, should have had a jolting effect on the network and price.\n\nHowever, what both events showed is that, for the most part, a halving can be pretty boring. While miners are affected, at today’s prices, there doesn’t appear to be an exodus any greater than what the network shows each month.\n\nSegregated witness, an improvement to the code that will solve transaction malleability and open the door to technology like Lightning Network, is still on its way. Companies like OpenBazaar continue to roll out what could be among the first promising consumer apps.\n\nFurther, new financial products, like the ETFs proposed by SolidX and the Winklevoss Twins continue to seek regulatory approval. And ultimately, bitcoin continues forward.\n\nWhile the halving event was an especially boring day for bitcoin, it showed, again, that it continues its journey from a risky experiment to real-world tool.\n\nTiny trophy image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As I wrote here recently, some of my media colleagues in 2014 wanted to hear nothing about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency and I was effectively shunned from some of the shows I'd gotten used to guesting on.\n\nToday? Not a day goes by that someone isn't emailing me or DMing me on Twitter, desperately asking how to buy Bitcoin. How to get in. How to store it. You know, the newbie questions.\n\nMan, it really got me down for a while - being told I was promoting something bad and trivial, when I knew in my heart (and the math clearly corroborated) that cryptocurrency is not bad, is not trivial, is not a fad - it's a very big emerging idea. One of those big ideas that could change everything in the years ahead. Bitcoin is a big deal.\n\nHOW TO BUY A BITCOIN\n\nWhen friends ask me how to buy Bitcoin, I usually just direct them to my friend invite page on Coinbase so they get some free Bitcoin as a bonus. Coinbase has more than 4.1 million customers in 32 supported countries. They're US-based, backed by some tech heavyweights including Marc Andreessen's VC fund, and in the couple of instances where I've had trouble, their support was always fast and cleared things up.\n\nWHAT ABOUT ETHEREUM?\n\nEthereum has skyrocketed in name recognition and usage since it launched a year ago, but it is still collectively only worth less than one tenth of Bitcoin's market cap - as I file this, Bitcoin is worth $10.41 billion, while secondplace cryptocurrency network Ethereum is worth $972 million.\n\nThe currency used within Ethereum, Ether (ETH), is mined and traded much like bitcoins are. Ether can be bought on Coinbase by going to exchange.coinbase.com after you're logged into your account: that page lets you trade Bitcoin in your Coinbase account for Ether (you can also deposit fiat currencies there), or trade your Ether back into Bitcoin. If that's too confusing, it has been reported that Coinbase will be adding an Ether direct buy feature to their platform later this month, making it easier for non-pro cryptocurrency users to get hold of the currency.\n\nHOW DO I STORE MY BITCOINS AND ETHERS?\n\nA number of excellent options here. Some users prefer to store their Bitcoins on a hardware wallet, such as the Bitcoin Trezor from Satoshi Labs (Trezor's team are reportedly working on hardware wallet support for Ether, too).\n\nAnother popular option for storing, sending, and receiving Bitcoins is the free Electrum wallet software for Mac, Windows, and Linux. (An Android version of Electrum is now also available.)\n\nWhat about for Ether? At the moment, the official wallet / browser Mist is a popular option for the desktop, while the Jaxx.io smartphone wallet app for Android and iPhone is becoming popular among Ethereum casual users as well. The snappy Jaxx mobile wallet also works with Bitcoin.\n\nI'M SO EXCITED, BUT SCARED!\n\nIt's okay. Cryptocurrency is a new and exciting field when you first look into it - even several years into researching the industry, I learn new things every day.\n\nWhile it's true that cryptocurrency markets can be very volatile, and less forgiving, than traditional fiat currency markets - it's also true that crypto is incredible to be a part of in these early years. Even with the volatility and uncertainty, there's something very efficient and fair about cryptocurrency.\n\nThe source code for Bitcoin and Ethereum is out in the open: experts review and add to it constantly.\n\nMillions of people already use digital currencies including Bitcoin and Ether. Although it's a brave new world, many of us are taking the leap and building this new economy out - not only because it benefits us more than the fiat economies we have no control over, but because it is truly fun.\n\nWhen you buy your first Bitcoin, you join this strange club. Where this all goes in the end, no one can tell with certainty yet. But in the meantime, you can follow my musings over on Twitter and watch my weekly interviews with leading cryptocurrency experts over on the YouTube channel.\n\nFull disclosure: Not financial advice, provided for educational purposes only.

They envisioned a service to give these new ventures a leg up before they go public or are sold.\n\nA year later, incubator Funderbeam has launched its innovative trading platform for startups saying it is “the first time in history where startup investments are being traded using blockchain technology.”\n\nFunderbeam’s goal is to change the game for early stage investors, making it their own choice as to how long they want to hold on to their investments. By using the Bitcoin blockchain to “tokenize” the investments, Funderbeam wants to make trading secure, efficient, open and transparent.\n\n“Investing in the future will be digital, always on, and transparent. As will companies,” said Kaidi Ruusalepp, Funderbeam’s CEO and co-founder and former CEO of Nasdaq Estonia. “I’m excited to see us take the first steps toward that future.”\n\nThe first two companies to be listed on the new exchange are two Estonian startups, Shipitwise and SportID. Both companies successfully conducted crowdfunding campaigns on Funderbeam first. A third startup, Sportlyzer, will follow shortly.\n\nFunderbeam is currently working with interested young companies in the U.K., Germany and Finland to expand its service beyond Estonia but wants to conduct a trial run with the first three startups to ensure a smooth operation.\n\nVenture capitalist Tim Draper said when Funderbeam first launched: “I love what they’re doing. You know, the existing public market is not working and Funderbeam is doing something about it.”\n\nAt the original announcement, CEO Ruusalepp predicted the growing importance of blockchain technology in the financial world:\n\n“Blockchains are going to do for the financial sector what the internet did for daily life as we know it. Stock exchanges have many intermediaries between the money and the company. Securities depositories, central banks, central counterparties, brokers, dealers and account operators. The blockchain is taking the role of some of these intermediaries. So it's making the process easier, cheaper and cross-border.”\n\nOver the last year, Funderbeam has helped angel investors and entrepreneurs discover, benchmark and analyze startups, using data from services such as AngelList and CrunchBase.\n\nFunderbeam has raised $2 million from investors to date and has an extensive data platform with information on more than 150,000 startups. The company’s website includes a detailed listing of new companies looking for funding, including how much has been raised to date as well as their funding goals and timeline.\n\nFunderbeam plans to take a 3 percent commission from successful ventures and may introduce trading fees in the future.\n\nNasdaq has led the way in developing blockchain technology for trading platforms with its Linq project and is currently working with Estonia’s Tallinn Stock Exchange.

The card can then be used to perform fiat-to-fiat conversions, as an online banking platform accessible worldwide, to verify Paypal accounts, among many things. The card can also be used in any place that Visa or Mastercard are accepted.\n\nLess Friction, More Usage\n\nThe virtual debit card also allows the purchase of bitcoin through Paypal in 37 countries. As many have discussed previously, connectivity to real world applications has been a huge hurdle for cryptos. Regarding the new offering Pavel Matveev, co-founder of Wirex says,\n\nSimply order the virtual card through Wirex app and now users can spend bitcoins anywhere Visa and Mastercard are accepted. We’re happy to give a lot more spending power to bitcoin users.\n\nMore details regarding the usage and procedures of using the virtual card can be found here.\n\nThe Trend Continues\n\nHighly visible moves like this are exactly what the crypto communities need to expand to a larger user base. In a technology that ultimately promises lower friction and borderless capabilities, there must be attention paid the infrastructure of payment systems. That is precisely what Wirex aims to do with the release of this card. We are witnessing the confluence of previously unconnected financial technology.\n\nCertainly, others are thinking in the same direction, but it is nonetheless exciting to see development, dollars and highly visible press releases directed at this goal.

Ripple, a DLT technology provider, believes the time is ripe for banks to work together to initiate a network for more efficient inter-bank and cross-border payments, according to a white paper [PDF] by Ripple and Accenture.\n\nThe paper, titled, “The Journey to Real-Time Cross Border Commercial Payments using Distributed Ledger Technology,” noted that more than 600 alternative distributed networks have emerged since bitcoin began in 2009, including Ripple, which came in 2012. Nevertheless, there is no widespread use of DLT in inter-bank commercial payments, an area with great opportunity.\n\nNumerous banks have tested the technology, but not many have used it to support customer business.\n\nRipple Seizes An Opportunity\n\nRipple has focused on inter-bank commercial payments and cross-border transfers since these payments usually use a network of banks without a central clearing house or authority. DLT brings an opportunity to make improvements over existing systems.\n\nCross-border payments currently have certain restraints. They usualy take more than a day and are restricted to business hours. At the point of initiation, the exchange rate and transaction fees can be unknown. The funds can move through many banks before reaching their destination, oftentimes incurring delays and additional fees. Customers often experience delays, high costs and uncertainties in managing these payments.\n\nBanks have to allocate resources to manage liquidity and transactions, respond to inquiries, repair payment details, track status and fix errors.\n\nRipple, in contrast, offers a real-time, 24/7, synchronous, transparent and information rich transactions. Payments are immediate with real-time confirmation, certainty, and transparency of rates and fees prior to the transaction.\n\nThe Ripple solution joins payment messaging with fund settlement, which has proven itself with domestic payment schemes and card systems like MasterCard and Visa. Such as system is not available for cross-border, inter-bank payments where messaging is isolated from the operation of vostro and nostro accounts used for settlement.\n\nThe Opportunity Is Now\n\nThe opportunity to initiate a Ripple-based network currently exists, as thousands of banks can be reached via correspondent banking that engages in cross-border payments, representing 10 to 15 billion payments with a yearly value of $25 to $30 trillion.\n\nBut the process will take careful planning, as these banks cannot link immediately into a new DLT network. Nor is it practical to expect fast migration to full-scale volume, as it would invite risk since there are too many uncertainties of how the network would operate.\n\nWhat is practical is to begin creating such a network from the bottom up, beginning with a small number of banks and transactions. The technology is available, and customer demand is strong. Deploying DLT technology iteratively permits learning by doing and a slow rollout that can scale gradually in a controlled manner.\n\nThis approach has its unknowns, but the unknowns can be quickly discovered and addressed. Initial adopters will learn things that will allow them to change and influence existing and new products, operating models and services needed to meet an increasingly dynamic payments industry.\n\nConsensus Needed\n\nA small number of banks must agree on the infrastructure. Each bank can make the necessary preparations to IT systems, priority payment flows, business processes, customers, regulatory obligations, all of which are “known knowns.” Banks can determine how these things will be affected and the changes that have to be made. They can decide on things like how many countries and customers to involve in the beginning.\n\nBanks may have to work with integration partners to determine the degree of integration that can be controlled so they can move from light integration to deeper integration as volume increases.\n\nWhat’s Needed Now\n\nA system of governance and a payment scheme will be needed to define participant requirements. These are the “known unknowns.” Forming a permissioned DLT network can determine who participates and how the network will operate. They have to work together to define controls and operating rules, but only to the degree needed to begin the network. The controls can be refined as the network expands.\n\nThe types of intermediaries and correspondents will change over time. Different scenarios exist for network adoption speed. These are “unknown knowns” that require a strategy for determining choice of payment flows, customers, products, services, new revenue streams, transaction growth rates, and the impact on correspondent banking.\n\nThe strategy can only be refined once the network launches and expands.\n\n‘Unknown Unknowns’\n\nThere are also “unknown unknowns” that cannot be predicted. Data controls, governance, confidentiality, security and confidentiality can be refined through experience in relation to growth. Banks, by being agile, can adapt and respond quickly to these unknowns as the network expands. It is a reason the network must begin small and scale steadily.\n\nCorrespondent banking is already established in global banking. Because banks have no wish to bring risks to cross-border payments, starting small and scaling makes sense as it allows banks to prepare internally to avoid disruptions and risks to their existing cross-border payments while introducing new capabilities.\n\nPrecedent Exists\n\nBanks have taken this approach in the past. The EBA Clearing established the Euro high-value payment system in 1999, launching with 44 banks in 21 countries. It was based on a design for settlement and clearing to meet its participants’ needs. Some banks committed all commercial payments to the Euro right away while others joined gradually.\n\nEBA Clearing has since expanded and the network reaches 4,806 banks. It is now launching an instant payment scheme involving 40 banks.\n\nThe Faster Payment (FPSL) began in 2008 with 13 member institutions in the U.K. and has expanded from 227,000 daily transactions to more than 3 million. FPSL is opening access to its infrastructure.\n\nBoth FPSL and EBA Clearing began small and scaled steadily, creating controls, services and governance as volume grew. The difference between these examples and DLT is that with the latter, no new major infrastructure has to be tested. Ripple is designed specifically for inter-bank and cross-border payments.\n\nFiat Settlement Mechanism Needed\n\nA settlement mechanism in fiat currency is required for cross-border payments. This cannot be avoided in a DLT payments network that does not operate solely with its own cryptocurrency to make payments. A DLT network can issue fiat currency, but such initiatives would have to be driven by central banks to issue the cryptocurrency.\n\nRipple has a native digital asset, XRP, that can provide settlement to reduce liquidity cost, but it has a flexible architecture that uses the Interledger Protocol that does not require using a cryptocurrency. Hence, a fiat currency settlement mechanism is required. This calls for creating a cross-border settlement scheme in the case of a DLT network for cross-border payments.\n\nThe rules, governance and planning component covers regulatory compliance, network participation rules, governance structure, payment settlement and processing, best practices like CPMI-IOSCO principles of financial market infrastructure, and validating and approving transactions through a consensus mechanism.\n\nCore scheme functions cover settlement, market maker management, risk management and assurance, scheme development participant management and communication, and on-boarding.\n\nProducts and services cover real-time payments, foreign exchange, and trade finance.\n\nOperations, data management and technology cover security, data access, consensus validation, access management and scheme management.\n\nSupport functions cover IT, finance, legal and billing.\n\nInfrastructure covers the DLT network that Ripple provides and the integration needed for banks to link to the network, such as message translation. Software providers such as D+H give standard Ripple integration to payment engine platforms.\n\nAlso read: Santander uses Ripple block chain tech for international payments\n\nCentralization Still Needed\n\nThe operating model resembles a centralized function, which contradicts the distributed nature of a DLT network. But this cross-border settlement scheme is needed for a permissioned network and for settlement to operate cross-border in fiat currencies.\n\nMasterCard and Visa use distributed networks for their banks, enforcing rules under their respective payment schemes. Hence, it is important to have a scheme for settling cross-border payments running on a DLT network.\n\nThe overhead of operating a DLT scheme for cross-border settlement is expected to be low and manageable.\n\nRipple offers a DLT solution for cross-border payments that integrates the messaging needed to clear payments among the sending bank with the settlement process that is needed to settle fiat funds among the banks. The solution reduces the cost of settlement by allowing banks to transfer and settle funds instantly and creates revenue opportunities by allowing access to new markets such as micropayments.\n\nRipple operates with banks like Fidor and Santander already. Central banks and governments support the technology. There is a strong desire among commercial banks to test the technology with real transactions. Several banks have done proof of concepts that include real money transfer. Thirty banks have done pilots and are moving to live operation.\n\nBanks Form An Alliance\n\nA group of banks have already formed an alliance to create a cross-border network and are preparing their strategy to define the cross-border settlement scheme. They are using an agile approach.\n\nThe pace of change is increasing with digital business models, smartphones, autonomous payments, APIs, real-time payments, and regulations such as PSD2 in Europe. Real-time, 24/7, domestic payments exist in the U.K. and Nordic countries and will extend to the rest of Europe, Australia and the U.S.\n\nNevertheless, a gap exists in the global payments landscape for real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments. To address the needs of the digital economy, this gap has to be filled.\n\nDLT offers a solution as banks are already upgrading business processes and IT systems for real-time domestic payments that can be used for real-time, cross-border payments.\n\nRipple stands ready to launch and scale a cross-border payments network. A group of banks has formed to use Ripple and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nThe $24 trillion annual global trade industry will not migrate to a new commercial payment network in five years. The level of migration will depend on competition from alternatives. A new network has to be created and be ready to scale steadily before full participation can begin.\n\nThe network cannot be designed in full prior to its launch. Certain unknowns can only be discovered through live experience, which is the fintech approach of agile development as opposed to the monolithic approach for big infrastructure systems.\n\nRipple calls on banks to collaborate to initiate the foundation of a 24/7, real-time, efficient, transparent cross-border payments network.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
07/17/2016,"['For the first time in India, the Narcotics Control Bureau has reported the activities of a darknet marketplace for drugs. The agency is currently investigating the syndicate behind it. Read more...\n\nIndia has registered its first case of illegal drug trafficking over the darknet using bitcoin as the mode of transaction. The country which has been slow in the adoption of digital currency in comparison with other nations has finally caught up with the global trend.\n\nThe reports of increased activity of darknet-based drug traffickers within the country were reported by the Indian anti-narcotics agency, Narcotics Control Bureau. Narcotics Control Bureau is the Indian equivalent of US DEA which is responsible for law enforcement and intelligence against drug trafficking and abuse of illegal substances.\n\nAccording to the agency, there are currently two syndicates which are involved in the drug trafficking operations who are under the NCB’s scanner. The Director General of NCB, RR Bhatnagar was quoted by the Indian Press saying,\n\n“For the first time, we have detected drug traffickers using the dark net and Bitcoin for running the illegal drug racket in India. I can tell you that our investigations have shown that some of these operatives are based in the country. We are probing them,”\n\nBitcoin has been the most favored currency of criminals and drug traffickers on the darknet for ages. Large deep web e-commerce sites like Silk Road have been instrumental in providing an organized platform for buying and selling narcotics, contraband and other illegal substances.\n\nThe rise in domestic drug trafficking involving “party drugs” comes at the time when NCB and other Indian law enforcement agencies have successfully reduced the inflow of heroin from across the national borders in Punjab. The State of Punjab has been the hotbed of drug trafficking and substance abuse involving heroin and opium. Following the government’s crackdown on these operations, many addicts in the region are moving towards prescription drugs and other concoctions to get their regular fix.\n\nWhile referring to the new menace, Bhatnagar also mentioned that the use of deep web and bitcoin for drug trafficking is a concern as it becomes harder to track the perpetrators. But the agency is confident about dealing with the issue as it is enhancing its capabilities to detect such instances.\n\nThese incidents may pose a threat to the Bitcoin ecosystem in India, right at the time when the country’s government and regulators are opening up to the digital currency and blockchain technology.\n\nRef: Hindustan Times | Image: NewsX', ""The exponential rate at which Steem grows may put on fast track a solution to the scaling issue that the Bitcoin community faces.\n\nSteem is a digital currency behind Steemit, a decentralized social media platform which rewards posters and voters online. Scaling Bitcoin has become a hot button issue in the community. This is the process to increase block size from its current form in which the network can only support up to seven transactions per second to process more like Paypal achieves with about 100 transactions per second, and as Visa does with about 4,000 per second.\n\nIn the wake of the Steemit hack\n\nRecently, Steemit was hacked, with about 260 accounts compromised.\n\nDavid Wachsman responded to those who claim the hack was intentionally organised by Steemit itself as false.\n\nHe wrote via email:\n\n“Without even presenting it to the Steemit team, I can tell you that the insinuation is completely outrageous and false. Once the issue was identified, the Steemit team worked heroically and tirelessly to protect its community. The Steemit team continues to work extraordinarily hard to get things back to normal as swiftly as possible. CEO Ned Scott may post updates to the situation on the Steemit website from time to time, and we plan on sharing those with the media simultaneously whenever possible.”\n\nOvertaking the DAO\n\nWith Steemit being touted to be the bridge that has the ability to bring people who have no interest in cryptocurrency into its world, Steem overtook The DAO to be the world’s fifth most valuable cryptocurrency following its 1000% plus growth in the days following Steemit’s first cryptocurrency payout on July 4. After the $1.3 million giveaway, the number of transactions, posts, votes and new users signing up to Steemit’s decentralized Reddit-like platform tripled.\n\nIn a media release its CEO, Ned Scott, says:\n\n“After the successful payout on July 4, consumers have seen that our system really works. Everyday users are jumping onboard our social network and many early adopters have benefited. People have started saying that they have paid their rent with money earned on Steemit. Others have bought cell phones, washing machines, and even paid their electricity bills. We have constructed perhaps the first Blockchain application that anyone can use. Content creators and curators have enjoyed earning valuable crypto rewards through a fun and seamless experience.”\n\nSteemit is on track to become one of the largest and fastest growing cryptocurrency projects worldwide in less than three months of its inception. As Steem reaches millions of people in the next year, it could possibly choke Bitcoin's capacity if all the people were to use Bitcoin as a gateway to buy in and/or cash out each month.\n\nEeks, in a post on Steemit, wrote that Steemit is the killer app Bitcoin has been waiting for to bring fresh and diverse people into Bitcoin and into cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe writer says Bitcoin companies and their products do nothing for people outside the one percent who know and use Bitcoin. He cites Purse.io as the closest thing to a Bitcoin killer app to convince those outside the cryptocurency community but, as yet, hasn’t had much luck. The same applies to OpenBazaar, Bitcoin gambling and P2P lending sites, who have not provided a reason for those people to care about Bitcoin or a need to have it, except for speculative purposes.\n\nIn an analogy, the writer concluded, based on available figures, that the new social media site could acquire at least a million Bitcoin active onboard users in a year.\n\n“And if it happens as I expect, Steemit will acquire 1 million or more people onboard per year. That's 1 million people becoming more comfortable with crypto, finding it usable and relatable. That's a huge win for Bitcoin and crypto. The value of any cryptocurrency are the people involved and the network effects they bring, all enabled by the underlying technologies and their usefulness. 1 million more active users into the cloistered world of cryptocurrency seems like a valuable breath of fresh air. Steemit, despite not even being a Bitcoin project, looks like it has the potential to be Bitcoin's killer app. Bitcoin holders rejoice.”\n\nIn a post by dantheman on Steemit, the writer says:"", 'Reddit user accuses Coinbase of tracking his bitcoin transactions after the company threatens the user with account closure for making transactions to a gambling platform.\n\nThe gap between bitcoin and fiat currency is gradually reducing. The realization of such a change is brought about by recent reports from a couple of people on social media channels stating that their bitcoin transactions are being tracked by a leading Bitcoin exchange and wallet platform – Coinbase.\n\nCoinbase is not new to controversies. The company has been receiving lots of ‘bad karma’ on Reddit for a while now. While the company seems to be doing all it takes to comply with the existing and non-existent regulations for digital currency platforms, Bitcoin community finds the very principle behind bitcoin’s creation compromised.\n\nFew users on Reddit have complained about Coinbase sending them a notice, warning them about the risk of their account being closed by the platform for allegedly transferring bitcoin from their Coinbase wallet to other platforms, including gambling sites. The allegations are also voiced by Bitbet.us on the same platform. Surprisingly, the reaction of the Reddit community has been moderate towards these allegations, with few commenters mentioning that they have known it all along.\n\nAt the same time, the post received few suggestions on circumventing Coinbase’s policies. A couple of suggestions included transferring bitcoin to another wallet before depositing it on any of the gambling platforms and the use of tumbling/mixing services.\n\nDon’t Blame Coinbase, Blame the Government\n\nIn another post on the same subreddit, Bruce Fenton shares the other side of the story by mentioning that Bitcoin companies like Coinbase and Circle are not the ones to be blamed for imposing such measures. He reasons that the main flaw lies with the regulations that require these companies to do so (track transactions) in order to continue their operations without government’s intervention.\n\nBruce in his statement shifts the blame from Bitcoin companies like Coinbase to the governments, regulatory bodies and Bitcoin industry groups that are asking for more regulations.\n\nThe allegations of Coinbase tracking customer wallets is not a new one, there have been numerous complaints about the platform blocking their accounts and even informing law enforcement authorities. However, these issues are here to stay irrespective of the platform one uses and may get even worse as the adoption of digital currency increases.\n\nRef: Reddit | Truth Voice | Image: NewsBTC', 'IBM has introduced a cloud-based blockchain service for business-to-business networks that allows companies to test performance, interoperability and privacy of blockchain ecosystems. The company noted in a press release that the service is suited to organizations in regulated industries.\n\nIBM’s blockchain cloud is supported by IBM LinuxOne, which IBM considers the industry’s most secure Linux-only server. LinuxONE addresses the security requirements of the healthcare, government and financial sectors.\n\nCloud Gives Secure Access\n\nIBM’s cloud services are designed to run blockchain in a production environment to enable clients to easily access a secure, portioned blockchain network they can deploy, test and operate. The IBM blockchain cloud protects data and entry points.\n\nThe service is currently in limited beta.\n\nIBM’s latest blockchain version is available through Bluemix, a service that creates blockchain applications and enables developers to monitor them on the IBM cloud.\n\nA Blockchain Pioneer\n\nThe new service marks a continuation of IBM’s pioneering role in promoting blockchain technology.\n\nEverledger, a company that tracks diamonds and other valuable products, is using the IBM blockchain to support Everledger’s global certification system through its supply chain. The service helps protects shippers, suppliers and buyers from counterfeiting, theft and other risks. Everledger uses the blockchain to demonstrate the origin of the goods.\n\nLeanne Kemp, CEO and founder of Everledger, said access, transparency and secured records are “everything” in the business of provenance. Being able to build, test, scale and refine on the IBM blockchain has accelerated Everledger’s ability to deliver innovative solutions to its partners confidentially.\n\nCCN reported last year that Everledger has received 850,000 diamonds to catalog and submit to the blockchain, essentially notarizing their ownership. Doing this makes the contract with the insurance company immutable and works in favor of both parties. The company makes money from its technology and from the blockchain’s notary capacities.\n\nData Breach Costs Soar\n\nThe cost of a data breach for enterprises reached $4 million last year while security incidents jumped by 64% in 2015, IBM noted. As a result, security is not just within the blockchain but with all technology the ledger touches.\n\nDonna Dillenberger, an IBM enterprise solutions fellow, said blockchain technology will change the way industries transfer digital assets, financial instruments and high-value goods.\n\n“With IBM Blockchain, we are expanding access to the emerging technology — not only by making it easy to get up and running on the IBM cloud, but also by using the most secure infrastructure,” Dillenberger said.\n\nIBM has pushed for the quick adoption of blockchain technology among enterprise and multiple industries with several newly revealed initiatives and commitments.\n\nAlso read: IBM calls for government to play a support role for ‘permissioned block chain’\n\nInnovation On Many Fronts\n\nIBM’s previously released 44,000 lines of code, now deemed open-source, to the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project, an open-source project that IBM is a member of, CCN reported. The code was developed by more than 35 global IBM researchers and software developers solely working toward the Linux Foundation project.\n\nThe company is also opening blockchain-centric spaces in the major financial hubs around the world called IBM Garages.\n\nThese spaces will enable IBM experts and developers to discuss the design and implementation of blockchain for businesses. IBM has noted that over 100 technical architects are working toward fast-tracking blockchain applications and technology for businesses.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and IBM.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nThe writer of this post is a guest.

""China has about $2.4tn of corporate debt at risk of default, leading to a very worrisome global financial future.""\n\nRines added that if Brexit slows the EU economy substantially, EU trade with China will slow, and more debt will become unserviceable.\n\n""This would be a negative shock, not only to China, but the world,"" she said, adding that the coordinated actions of central banks have helped stem any immediate damage.\n\nChen Zhao, co-director of global macro research at Brandywine Global, agrees policy responses have been ""quick and decisive.""\n\nWhile a number of analysts have warned about China’s growing debt burden, Zhao asserted that the ""concerns over China’s debt and its associated risks are grossly exaggerated.""\n\nHe emphasized that in developing nations, ""debt occurs primarily because savings needs to be converted into investment"". Since China has such a high savings rate, its ""high leverage is inevitable.""\n\nRines also weighed in, stating that ""there is certainly too much debt, but China has a significant capacity to paper over the issue in the near-term.""\n\nRegardless of how capable the nation is of addressing its highly leveraged nature in the short-term, Chen emphasized the problematic nature of China’s state-owned sector. This industry ""consumes too much credit — it uses 80% of total bank credit to produce only 20% of GDP.""\n\nHe added that ""this issue must be addressed before the economy can regain efficiency"".\n\nPotential shift\n\nWhile legitimate efforts to resolve this situation may represent a sea change in policy, Zhao emphasized that the Brexit could potentially represent a broad shift away from the globalization that has ""dominated the world economy for the last 30 years.""\n\nShould this change take place, it could have a particularly large impact on China, which has benefited substantially from globalization.\n\nBy providing additional additional headwinds to this major economy – and also fueling greater uncertainty – a shift away from globalization could potentially provide bitcoin prices with additional tailwinds.\n\nCharles L.

However, Blockchain is fast expanding beyond Bitcoin with banks, financial institutions, and individuals slowly understanding the benefits that it can produce.\n\nNot only that, but with more people finding it easier to invest in the digital currency with financial institutions such as American Express, Nasdaq, and Visa investing in blockchain startups, the world surrounding blockchain is experiencing an attitude change.\n\n1. Adyen\n\nAmsterdam-based, Adyen is a leading e-commerce payments company globally across six continents for companies such as Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, Netflix, and Spotify.\n\nAt the beginning of 2016, the Bitcoin-accepting company announced that they had doubled its annual revenue in 2015 and were, subsequently, expanding its next generation point of sale solutions to the U.S. market.\n\nIn 2015 Adyen’s yearly transaction volume reached $50 billion while its revenue surged, amounting to $350 million in the same year.\n\n2. Bitnation\n\nRun by Susan Tempelhof, Bitnation is the world’s first Digital Nation providing governance services on its platform, Pangea, with the help of the blockchain technology, where it aims to create a nation where state governments become irrelevant.\n\nTempelhof said to CoinTelegraph that when Bitnation started, no one had ever attempted to create a Blockchain-powered Digital Nation. Since then, they have done the first ever marriage, world citizenship, birth certificate, land titles, issued refugees IDs, public notary in partnership with Estonia and a constitution on the blockchain.\n\nTempelhof says:\n\n“Now, the idea has a worldwide following, a community of thousands of citizens and activists, embassies, partners and allies on all continents, extensive mainstream media coverage, and is being replicated by others.”\n\nFor Bitnation, however, the real test will be to gain significant market adoption for the Pangea software. The company hopes to have a test version ready by the end of the year with its first public release in 2017.\n\n3. Braintree\n\nSan Francisco-based Braintree is an online payments processor that powers one-click payments for consumer apps.\n\nAfter acquiring the Venmo app in 2012, Braintree was bought by PayPal in 2013 for $800 million, helping PayPal to acquire technology for back-end payment processing from Uber to Airbnb.\n\nWith 500 employees present around the world, Braintree’s growth is expanding in its overall payment volume, which amounted to $50 million in 2015 alone, making Braintree a big part of PayPal’s future success.\n\n4. Chain\n\nFounded in 2014, blockchain startup Chain works with leading financial institutions to build blockchain networks. By working with the likes of Visa, Citi, Nasdaq, Capital One, First Data, MUFG, Orange, State Street, Fidelity, and Fiserv, Chain's goal is to transform the financial services industry by enabling firms to digitize financial instruments.\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph, chief marketing officer, Fleur Sohtz said that Chain’s software facilitates the issuance, transfer, and settlement of assets on a Blockchain network. The company believes that this will fundamentally improve the infrastructure of the financial services industry by allowing real-time asset movement with added security and clarity.\n\nSohtz says:\n\n“When trusted institutions can issue digital assets on a secure blockchain network, financial services will be less expensive, more secure, work better together, and be accessible to customers globally.”\n\nIt aims to do this through the development of enterprise level software that is designed to improve the core infrastructure that the financial system relies on.\n\nTogether with their partners they aim to enable any asset to move quickly and intelligently as data, thus reducing costs and providing an improved platform for products to be built on.\n\n5.

The NCB investigations have indicated that some of the people involved are based in the country, and the agency is continuing to investigate, according to the Economic Times in India.\n\nBhatnagar said the bureau has interdicted both syndicates, and both are selling party drugs.\n\nTactics Alarming\n\nHe noted the secretive measures the bureau is taking over the Internet is troubling, but it is strengthening its abilities to detect such crimes.\n\nThe cross-border heroin trade, meanwhile, has declined, Bhatnagar said. He noted there has been a 30 percent fall in trafficking in Punjab, which he attributed to the effective actions the agency has taken.\n\nThe director general told the Union Home Ministry during a formal meeting that Punjab drug addicts were becoming attracted to medicine-based concoctions as a result of the bureau’s actions against traditional narcotics.\n\nPunjab Leads In Drug Seizures\n\nPunjab accounted for the most opium and heroin seizures in the country in 2015, according to data Bhatnager presented.\n\nSynthetic drugs have been replacing semi-synthetic and natural products that users have abused for several decades, the report noted.\n\nIllegal drug sales over the darknet have not declined since the 2013 closure of the Silk Road website, contrary to some expectations, CCN reported.

In last year’s survey, that rate increased 400% to 25% of all respondents. The annual survey is overseen by Adam Winstock, a British addictions psychiatrist, who says that the availability of drugs online does not lead to an increase in the number of people using “social drugs.” It has only changed the venue more from in-person to online marketplaces.\n\nSince Silk Road’s closure in 2013, drug listings online have also been shown to triple in number from a fleet of new websites. Since October of 2013, sites like Agora and the recently-closed Evolution have passed the size of Silk Road’s business, at least in the number drug listing.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Trust, it is one of the most important things any monetary system has to have, both the financial aspects and those controlling it. As a new idea built in new technology, it has been an uphill battle for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry to build that trust with a wider audience. The concept of a digital currency has been difficult for some to understand, and the technology itself similarly, however with a recent report showing that in Brazil Bitcoin trading volume exceeded that of spot Gold in the first 6 months of 2016, is this a sign that the battle for trust has been won?\n\nA trend has been growing for some time during the financial uncertainty we have been experiencing in various countries around the world, and that is more people looking to Bitcoin as an alternative safe haven investment. Perhaps the first sign of this was during the financial crisis in Greece, as restrictions were put on fiat money systems, including the amount of currency bank account holders were allowed to draw out per day (just 65 euros for a while), so more people turned to Bitcoin. Given that the cryptocurrency exists outside of the controls of the fiat system to a large extent, this perhaps should not be surprising.\n\nThe trend has continued, and the 50% rise in value of bitcoin over the first 6 months of 2016 is an indicator of that rise in interest too. As financial uncertainty, and reducing trust in the traditional systems continues, this increased interest shows no signs of slowing down, and a recent report by non-profit organization FEE that looked into the use of cryptocurrency in Brazil confirms this. Brazil has been in political turmoil for a while with calls of corruption throughout government seeing mass demonstrations in the streets. What the repost shows is that with this ongoing issue as a backdrop, the total volume of Bitcoin trading in the first 6 months of 2016 exceeded that of Gold spot trading in the same period for the first time ever.\n\nThis is a very different situation to Greece, in that the economy itself in Brazil is growing, it is the political environment that is causing the uncertainty, and yet Bitcoin is still an asset investors are turning to. For everyday investors today, buying Gold is not a straightforward business, a fractional market means owning a promissory note for gold is not owning real gold, and in a crash would not always be protected, and in that situation it is clear those without the large funds to secure physical gold are looking at digital currencies, Bitcoin especially, as an alternative.\n\nThis is actually an exciting time for the industry itself and for the entire financial system, as people are making the transition to digital assets rather than that most stable of precious metals, Gold, it suggests that there really is room for an alternative and normal, everyday people are very willing to embrace it.', 'We\'re well into 2016 - the year the more dire YouTube videos five and six years ago from alternative media personalities said would be catastrophic.

So before fiat currencies like the US Dollar and euro, and things like PayPal, people around the world of various cultures and eras basically always used gold - and sometimes silver - as a monetary tool for value transfer and value storage. Gold or silver coins in the pocket, gold bars in the bank vault. Worked for thousands of years, in hundreds of cities.\n\nThe US Dollar has a 45 year market history since its current post-Nixon iteration, the Euro has an even shorter 17 year market history since its introduction to global markets, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are only - at most - six to seven years old. Similarly, many bond products that took off in the 1980s and bundled synthetic financial products that came along even later have relatively short market histories.\n\nSo how do we figure out the relative performance of such new inventions? We have to compare to what people used to use, in one way or another. Since gold has more than 5,000 years in economic use within human societies, let\'s go with gold.\n\nEven today, in an era where precious metals have been officially de-monetized, gold is a huge market: $70 to $80 billion of the shiny yellow metal trades each day globally, and the total gold market is valued at around $9 trillion.\n\nIf you look at BitGold\'s constantly updated gold price chart, it\'s clear the major fiat currencies - the US Dollar, the Euro, the Chinese yuan, and so forth - have caught more than a little cold. Is this a flu? Is it something even more serious?\n\nThe math is dire: gold is up 17.18% against the almighty buck over the past year. Gold is up 14.64% over the same time period against the Euro; the metal\'s up 26.83% against the yuan. And against the Russian ruble? Gold is up 29.82% against the Russian ruble over the past year!\n\nThese are ""tech stock"" returns coming from... gold. An inert metal that sits in a vault.\n\nWhat is going on? This suggests a growing loss of confidence in some of these major fiat currencies, and/or a growing desire to find ""safe havens"" - basically, people are afraid, so money is diversifying itself. Gold may not have an old rich lady\'s face printed on it, and it is shiny and scary, but the surprisingly stable 5,000 year purchasing power history of gold is suddenly becoming... as I wrote above... almost tech stock sexy all of the sudden.\n\nConsider, for example, that legendary billionaire investor George Soros is heavily invested in the gold industry now, and that he\'s not the only billionaire who has caught a taste for gold recently.\n\nFurther, BitGold and its parent company Goldmoney have quietly amassed more than one million passionate users. These users spend, save, and send payments denominated in actual gold grams using the company\'s technology.\n\nI put up a video recently showing off some of the gold cubes I bought from them with a cryptocurrency, Ether. Gold cubes bought with a non-government created, non-fiat digital currency that gets mined out of the cryptographic ether, no pun intended. We are clearly living in the future. A few minutes watching Ethereum\'s blockchain stats dashboard one night with a glass of wine (or something even more potent) in hand will convince you beyond any doubt you are living in a Philip K. Dick novel where the nerds won and the banks are about to collapse ""Mr. Robot"" Season One style...\n\nBITCOIN\'S GROWTH STORY\n\nI got so annoyed answering individual emails from readers about how to buy Bitcoins that I put up that piece explaining how to do it, but I still get emails. Bitcoin is slowly starting to take off in its own time and in its own ways, it appears. And its growth from $0 in 2009 when it launched to a $10.7 billion market cap currency as I file this - as well as the untold millions of people on the Internet who already use it - suggest a movement away from traditional financial platforms and banks, toward Bitcoin and its newer relatives.\n\nIf rising gold prices are showing us how fragile and unhealthy the major currencies are becoming, Bitcoin\'s rise shows the amount of discontentment with the traditional banking tools and systems themselves.\n\nIt\'s too early to tell how big or significant all this might become one day, but at least according to William Mougayar (author of The Business Blockchain), it\'s entirely possible that ""the next Google"" could emerge from a blockchain technology like Ethereum or Bitcoin. Watch my recent interview with him below:\n\nNot financial advice. No warranties or guarantees provided; not a recommendation to buy or sell gold, Bitcoin, or any other asset. At time of publication, I do hold some ethers and bitcoins in my long term portfolio. In the past, I have done some freelance consulting for BitGold.', 'In yet another sign that companies are eager to turn digital currencies into proper investment vehicles, a newly formed company called EtherIndex LLC filed last Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch an exchange-traded fund based on ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum network.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of the SEC opening a proposal for a Bitcoin ETF by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Gemini for public comment, and a filing last Tuesday by SolidX to launch a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nEther is a young digital currency, similar to Bitcoin, launched not quite a year ago. Its market cap is a fraction that of Bitcoin’s — for the last month, it’s both exceeded and dipped below the $1 billion range, while Bitcoin’s market cap is has been more stable around $10 billion.\n\nThe filing is remarkably early for such a young cryptocurrency, especially one that has been beset by problems and volatility in the last month.\n\nHowever, the recent activity around cryptocurrency ETFs indicates that many recognize the demand for legitimate digital currency investment vehicles. Investors are extremely limited in ways to get Bitcoin exposure in their portfolios. The Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) by Grayscale Investments is one such vehicle, and it trades at a significant premium to Bitcoin itself. Intended to be priced at one-tenth the cost of one Bitcoin, it trades on the open market at near double that.\n\nThere is currently no way for investors to get ether exposure in their portfolios.\n\nDespite investor interest, given how immature ether is as a cryptocurrency, it seems unlikely the SEC would be comfortable using it as an underlying asset in an investment vehicle any time soon.\n\nAdditionally, the S-1 filing appears to be hastily put together -- another reason eager ether investors may be in for a wait.\n\nEtherIndex itself was only founded a month ago, and its filing is mostly incomplete, acting more as a shell or placeholder. It does not name an exchange, ticker, trustee or administrator. (Gemini’s proposed Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust has selected BATS, and SolidX intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange.)\n\nThe lack of other infrastructure players could reflect the thin relationships that the cofounders have. Chief executive officer, Gregory DiPrisco, whose LinkedIn profile indicates he is a futures trader at energy trading firm Axiom Markets, does not seem to have other experience with digital currencies. Cofounder and chief financial officer Joseph Quintillian, whose LinkedIn profile states he is a partner at Axiom, similarly does not appear to have other virtual currency experience.\n\nDiPrisco and Quintillian did not respond to calls and messages for comment.\n\nGiven how nascent ether is, the recent troubles its had, and EtherIndex’s lack of a track record, it could be a while before the SEC is comfortable with creating a proper investment vehicle backed by ether, especially one created by an inexperienced team. The first gold ETFs, GLD and IAU, launched about a dozen years ago, were brought to market by ETF companies Spider and iShares.\n\nEther is currently in a shaky state, with the Ethereum community attempting to emerge from a crisis sparked by a crowdfunding project called the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (the DAO), which raised more than $150 million in ether — the largest crowdfunding project in history.\n\nHowever, the project turned sour when a nefarious actor or actors exploited a loophole in the project to steal about $50 million of ether. Since then, confidence in the currency has been shaken, and the value plummeted from about $20 per ether to $10 and is now trading at about $11.\n\nStill, financial institutions are building up infrastructure to bring digital currencies into traditional investing. One of the largest derivatives exchanges, CME Group , plans to launch a Bitcoin reference rate and a real-time index that acts as a price discovery mechanism. And a recent white paper by ARK Investment Management, the first public fund manager to invest in Bitcoin in its ARKW ETF, and a Bitcoin company Coinbase, which also has an institutional grade exchange, Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), found that Bitcoin has the properties of a new asset class.\n\n“[The filing by EtherIndex] is confirmation that many people are seeing cryptocurrencies as a new asset class and they’re trying to securitize them and offer more investors exposure,” says Chris Burniske, blockchain analyst and products lead at ARK. “On the flip side of things, these are long processes, and the SEC needs to get comfortable with these things. Just because there’s a filing in the water doesn’t mean that a public listing is impending.”', 'In a newly released report, the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) has analyzed certain websites or ‘business models’ that infringe on intellectual property rights, some of which that relies on bitcoin and TOR.\n\nThe EUIPO, the authority that manages the EU trade mark and works alongside the IP offices of other EU member commissioned a research study on business models that actively infringe on intellectual property rights (IPR).\n\nThe study [PDF], commissioned in 2015 and released recently, highlights several methods and practices through which pirates and pirate-friendly domains use technologies to evade authorities. Altogether, 25 websites or business models were identified. Websites that were built up due to the “ingenuity” of IPR infringers who have even “outpaced” the development of legitimate business models that are playing catch-up to understanding e-commerce business models, according to the report.\n\nThese models, according to the report, are using new technologies to profit from illegal IPR infringements. More specifically, technologies such as bitcoin and TOR, says the EUIPO.\n\nAn excerpt from the forward of the report reads:\n\nIt [a piracy-centric shadow economy] more and more relies on new encrypted technologies like the TOR browser and the bitcoin virtual currency, which are employed by infringers of IPR to generate income and hide the proceeds of crime from the authorities.\n\nBitcoin & the Money Trail\n\nMost business models of the 25 under the scanner uses TOR technology, with many located on the Darknet. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin and Anoncoin are seen as common payment options among these websites, with some websites favoring bitcoin payments with specific discounts on offer for users paying with the cryptocurrency. One TOR website that offers nearly 85,000 ebooks for free accepts user donations, with bitcoin also accepted.\n\nThere are at least three websites listed on the open internet, which accept VISA and MasterCard payment cards.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is viewed as a concern by the EUIPO because of the lack of evidence connecting bitcoin addresses or wallet IDs with individuals. In the report, Bitcoin gets a quick explanation for those who are uninitiated.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain distributed ledger is even recognized as a “vital security feature” that acts to negate malicious manipulation while avoiding regulation. Still, it’s hard to follow the money trail, according to the EUIPO. It states:\n\nThere are no public records connecting Bitcoin wallet IDs with personal information of individuals. Because of these Bitcoin transactions are considered semi-anonymous.\n\nThe study concludes by stating that its intention to help policymakers, society, and private businesses understand how IPR infringing websites function and how they are financed.\n\nLast week, the EUPIO and Europol – the European Union’s criminal intelligence agency – came together to launch the Intellectual Property Crime Coordination Coalition (IPC3). The coalition will see law enforcement agencies within the EU and beyond gain better intelligence and coordination to combat infringements of intellectual property rights.\n\nFeatured image from Europa.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'With the UK still recovering from Brexit, Stratis, a London-based blockchain solutions company with the goal of building a Blockchain Development Platform for developing blockchain apps has raised over £100,000 worth of BTC from its ICO.\n\nKicking off its ICO in June, Stratis offers their blockchain token which is used to run the Stratis blockchain and sidechain features to any participants of the ICO. Stratis has 84,000,000 Stratis tokens for sale to investors.\n\nOnce developed, Stratis will allow anyone to create and manage blockchains within minutes with the ability to customise their own private sidechains which will be secured by the main Stratis blockchain, allowing developers and small companies to experiment with blockchains, not just large companies such as JPMorgan-Chase and the Deutsche Bank.\n\nChris Trew, Founder of Stratis states:\n\n“Our company is primarily on blockchain provisioning for the business community in an increasingly digital economy. Blockchain is a game changer but there is still a real need to lower the barriers to entry so that more people can get involved with the technology, discover it’s utility and ultimately be able to compete in a changing marketplace”\n\nChanging Blockchain-as-a-Service\n\nThe Stratis platform itself will be cloud-based and will be an open-source Bitcoin full node framework written in C# and the Microsoft .NET framework rather than Bitcoin’s original C++ node with several added features allowing it to be easier to maintain existing code and make it more attractive to developers.\n\nAccording to Stratis, Bitcoin core developer, Nicolas Dorier has brought his Bitcoin expertise to the Stratis team.\n\nWhile Ethereum has its smart contracts and WAVES has its custom blockchain asset features, Stratis will be changing Blockchain-as-a-Service by implementing custom, private sidechains which will decrease the amount of time and resources spent attempting to clone the Bitcoin blockchain while still giving organisations the full features of blockchain technology ready to deploy at the click of a button.', 'The Fed\'s money printing policy had led the commodity Guru Jim Rogers to remark: ""The Fed will continue to print money until there are no trees left in America.""\n\nSince the last financial crisis, the combined central banks have pumped massive amounts of money into the system and they continue to do so at a rapid pace. Nonetheless, the world is closer to a financial crisis than ever before.\n\nThe Brexit results have also opened up a possibility of another round of easing by the central banks, around the world. The Bank of England will most likely resort to an easing schedule during the next meeting and that will be followed by the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve . Following his victory in the recent elections, the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to push the Bank of Japan to announce another round of easing.\n\nThe macroeconomic situation of the world does not give confidence to astute investors. This is evident by the return of the legendary George Soros, who has come out of retirement to short the overblown markets. Similarly, other hedge fund managers are stocking up on gold , which supports the view that a financial crisis is right around the corner.\n\nPeople look at alternate asset classes when their confidence in traditional assets fades. Since the beginning of the year, both the stock and the commodity markets have been on a roller coaster ride while catching both the bulls and the bears on the wrong side.\n\nBitcoin is on a huge streak. Its performance over the last year has been outstanding and it has outperformed most asset classes, by a wide margin. It\'s probably the only asset class which beats out both gold and silver, in 2016. Why is it shooting into outer space?\n\nBitcoin Is Doing the Opposite of Central Banks\n\nCompare this with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Unlike the traditional currencies, the Bitcoin has an upper limit of 21 million coins, after which no more Bitcoins can be mined. It\'s tightening.\n\nEvery subsequent mining will become difficult and will reduce the reward associated with mining each block. Satoshi Nakamoto programmed that after mining of 210,000 blocks, the rewards will be halved. Initially, the reward was 50 Bitcoins for every block, which was halved by the end of 2012, at which time the reward was reduced to 25 Bitcoins per block. The next round of halving took place last week, when the rewards were reduced to 12.5 Bitcoins per block.\n\nWhile the central banks have been on a printing spree, the Bitcoin is on a tightening route which boosts its price, as is visible in its sharp rise this year.\n\nA few miners will find it difficult to continue mining at the halved rewards, which is likely to slow down new mining as halving will continue, in the future.\n\n""The block halving will dramatically decrease the bitcoin being added as we approach 75% of all bitcoin issued. People understand that in this world of ever expanding assets and printing of money, we have something that\'s fixed and limited in issuance. It gives a decent alternative for people who want to hold assets that can have sustained purchasing power,"" said Bobby Lee, chief executive of China-based BTCC, which is one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in the world.\n\nBitcoin and digital currencies and are changing the world, financial systems, and lives in huge way, and this is only the beginning.\n\nBitcoin\'s volatility has dropped dramatically over the past few years with the lowest linear level of volatility seen since is this asset class started. It has become easier to use for trading and purchasing.\n\nI would also recommend researching digital wallet solutions where you can purchase many up-and-coming digital currencies on one place as I\'ve been doing. Why? Because I firmly believe the masses will slowly migrate their money into various digital currencies as a safe-haven store of wealth and for ease of use. Payments can be made with your mobile phone to anyone, anywhere in the world and for any amount with no fees or costs, -- and in many cases it cannot be traced.\n\n---\n\nSubscribe to my trading and investing newsletter to learn which digital wallet and digital currencies I will be buying.

Read more..\n\nCompetition from the digital currency sector has forced Western Union to introduce new fee-free network payment structure called WU EDGE. The new platform is slated to enable transactions between two parties in a matter of minutes. With WU EDGE, Western Union (NYSE : WU) intends to compete with Bitcoin-based remittance and payments platforms that have been offering instant transfers since their introduction. However, there are currency exchange charges applicable for transactions over WU EDGE.\n\nWU EDGE, an Attempt to Keep up with Bitcoin\n\nUntil recently, there were limited options available for people to send money across geographical boundaries. Those away from their families; working in different countries; businesses working with international clients; and freelancers working on projects for those in other parts of the world, were all made to either execute a wire transfer from their bank accounts or use other centralized remittance services like the Western Union and MoneyGram (NASDAQ:MGI). In both the cases, the customer was forced to bear transaction charges and currency conversion fees. Depending upon the transaction size, these charges can turn out to be a small fortune. However, things have changed in the remittance market since bitcoin and other digital currencies made an appearance.\n\nBitcoin has disrupted the banking and financial sector with fast and inexpensive transactions, which combined with the other far-reaching applications of its underlying blockchain technology make automation of banking and financial operations possible. Being an open source, peer to peer platform for value transfer, Bitcoin has allowed many companies to come up with their own remittance services as a cheaper and a more economical alternative to conventional services like the Western Union.\n\nThe WU EDGE (Western Union Enterprise Digital Global Exchange) platform is built by Western Union Business Solutions, the business arm of Western Union Company. Currently available in 7 countries viz., Hong Kong, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the Czech Republic, the platform is open only for businesses.\n\nIn a quote, the President of Western Union Business Solutions Kerry Agiasotis says,\n\n“Buying and selling overseas has never been easier, it’s now possible to make an international business payment in minutes… Since the launch of the WU EDGE platform businesses across the world have used the platform to support their aspirations to grow, invest and deliver the jobs of the future. We are very proud of today’s announcement; we view ourselves as business partners to our SME customers.”\n\nWU EDGE platform is looking forward to connecting buyers and sellers across the world to offer real-time connections and payments. Whereas, Bitcoin allows everyone to make transactions irrespective of whether the parties are individuals or businesses.\n\nWe can see more platforms, coming up with similar features to keep up with the digital currency based financial services, which continue to offer a bargain over conventional ones.\n\nRef: Finextra | Image: Reuters', 'Image: Shutterstock\n\nBitcoin is not anonymous. Anyone who has followed the dark web or the continuing regulation of the cryptocurrency should be familiar with that idea. If someone manages to link a real identity to a wallet—something that we\'ve seen is possible—they can then follow other transactions around the public blockchain to see where else that person\'s money has traveled.\n\nNow, researchers are releasing an open-source tool for grouping bitcoin transactions together in order to identify which belong the same entity, marketplace, or person. It doesn\'t necessarily reveal the identity of the bitcoin user, but it can show details about someone\'s bitcoin spending.\n\n""Our goal is not to help either the offenders or law enforcement""\n\n\n\n""Our goal was to see, how much data can you gather on people who are using the bitcoin network, and can you aggregate the bitcoin wallets which seem to be anonymous and isolated from one another?"" David Décary-Hétu, an assistant professor at the School of Criminology at the University of Montreal, told Motherboard in an interview. Along with Mathieu Lavoie, a researcher and penetration tester at a large financial institution, the pair will be presenting their work at the upcoming HOPE hacking conference later this week.\n\nLavoie originally showcased the Python-based tool, now known as BitCluster, back at the NorthSec 2015 conference. By analysing transactions between addresses, the tool allows users to build up a network of associated bitcoin wallets and download the results in a spreadsheet.\n\nA screenshot of BitCluster searching a wallet associated with a dark web marketplace\n\n\n\n""Instead of seeing movement per addresses, you see movement per entity,"" Lavoie told Motherboard. That entity might be a drug dealer, a fraudster, or an ordinary bitcoin user. Décary-Hétu and Lavoie will be showing their own BitCluster findings on ransomware operators and dark web marketplaces at HOPE.\n\nIn lots of cases, ransomware authors—the people behind malware that locks down a computer until a bitcoin bounty is paid—give each victim their own bitcoin address to send money to. That way, the criminals can keep track of who has actually paid. But if the author pools all of that cash back into one wallet, ""Then we can see exactly how much money they\'ve made, because we can group this data by date or amount, we can know exactly when the first victim sent them money,"" Décary-Hétu said.\n\nAs for dark web marketplaces, it is possible to cluster the wallets that are being used for escrow payments on any one market—that is, the money held by the market until sellers fulfill their end of the deal. The pair has data for the original Silk Road, but also more recent and still up-and-running markets, such as AlphaBay and Nucleus. Using this information, it\'s possible to see how many people were making payments at any one time, how much was made overall, or the average amount of transactions on a market.\n\nA screenshot of BitCluster searching a wallet associated with a dark web marketplace\n\n\n\nPrevious research has used the feedback left by customers on marketplaces to track dark web expenditure. ""Using this BitCluster tool, we can validate the data we have, or even correct it in some cases,"" Décary-Hétu said.\n\nBitCluster will be open-source, but the researchers aren\'t planning on hosting a version themselves; it takes up a lot of computing resources, especially for very popular entities, such as shuttered bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, so other investigators will likely need to setup their own instance of it.\n\nPresumably, researchers may not be the only ones to take advantage of BitCluster; law enforcement could use it too.\n\n""Our goal is not to help either the offenders or law enforcement. It\'s an open tool to help people have a better idea of what is going on with the bitcoin network,"" Décary-Hétu said.\n\nThere are ways of handling bitcoin that make BitCluster\'s job much harder, though. Tumblers, for example, send random amounts of bitcoins to a selection of addresses. BitCluster may, however, be able to track the money if it all eventually lands in a single account.\n\nUltimately, the best tactic to avoid being profiled by a tool like this is not to share addresses and to create single-use wallets per transaction. Then, even if a wallet or two are linked, they should be isolated from any other transactions on the blockchain.\n\n""This tool can help us understand bitcoin movements when people are not using it properly,"" Décary-Hétu said. ""And let\'s face it, most people are not using it properly.""', 'Ethereum Co-Founder and longtime contributor to the blockchain ecosystem Charles Hoskinson recently appeared on an episode of Coinscrum’s Members Club series, where he shared his thoughts on Ethereum’s potential hard fork for bailing out those who were negatively affected by The DAO. Hoskinson pointed out a variety of issues The DAO had from the beginning, and he also shared his thoughts on why the upcoming hard fork would be a mistake.\n\nAlthough Hoskinson was one of the original eight founders of Ethereum, he left the project in June 2014. He is now the CEO of Input Output, a Hong Kong-based financial technology company that builds cryptocurrencies and blockchains for their clients.\n\nThe Problem with DAOs and Smart Contracts\n\nBefore getting into the issues with The DAO, Hoskinson discussed smart contracts more generally. He pointed out that decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can be useful, and he even talked about a possible DAO for Bitcoin development that would allow the community to directly pay for new changes to the protocol.\n\nAfter discussing the positive aspects of smart contracts, Hoskinson described one of the key issues with these new financial instruments. “Unfortunately, these ideas are encapsulated with thousands of booby traps, cobras, and other terrible things,” he stated. “Why? Because they involve people. Algorithms are really dumb, and people are really smart. If a human designs an algorithm, then there’s going to be a human that’s really good at designing a way out of that algorithm to steal funds. That’s exactly what happened with [The DAO].”\n\nThe key issue is that smart contracts are extremely difficult to secure in these early days. For this reason, security experts believe there could be more financial disasters built on Ethereum in the future. Rootstock, an Ethereum-esque sidechain of Bitcoin, has discussed the need for “progressive decentralization” as a way to guard against these issues.\n\nThe Many Problems with The DAO\n\nAfter making that general point about smart contracts, Hoskinson turned his attention to The DAO. “Some guys from some company, which shall remain nameless, made a decision to maximize decentralization without any safeguards and accepting any personal liability,” he noted. “They wrote a bunch of code, and they thought it worked. And they wrote it in a language that really doesn’t give you any formal guarantees (Solidity). Then, they went ahead and released it uncapped, and let $150 million of value pool — assuming that, somehow, random people on the Internet would be better at investing that money than professionals.”\n\n“Okay, it’s a wisdom of the crowds argument. Everybody has a right to do that and participate,” Hoskinson added.\n\nOne of the issues with cryptocurrencies and smart contracts is that not as many people will review code if there isn’t much money at stake. This means many more smart people were taking their first look at The DAO only after it was able to raise a large sum of money. All of the ether held in The DAO (over $150 million worth) essentially became a bug bounty on the smart contract. Bitcoin’s market cap has played a similar role for its own security ever since people started to place real value of bitcoin tokens.\n\n“The problem is that code didn’t behave the way they intended,” Hoskinson continued. “The philosophical question, and this is the fundamental of a DAO, is when you turn the driver’s keys over from a Ferrari to a machine, you have to sometimes accept that the Ferrari is going to kill people. And you have to accept those consequences.”\n\nWhether the Ethereum community wants to accept the consequences of a bad smart contract has created a secondary issue with The DAO, which is the push to hard fork the Ethereum blockchain in order to bail out DAO token holders.\n\nWhy Ethereum Should Not Hard Fork\n\nHoskinson was very clear on how he feels about the idea of reversing Ethereum transactions made possible by bad smart contract code. “When you start intervening, it kind of diminishes the entire purpose of these types of systems in general,” he stated.\n\n“The other thing is it creates a moral hazard of when and how do you intervene?” Hoskinson added.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder went on to talk about the hack of cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin and asked why a hard fork was not implemented then to reverse that theft. Hoskinson also pointed to all of the ether buyers who have lost their wallets up to this point. “Should we intervene to go ahead and reimburse those people?” he asked.\n\nHoskinson then pointed to an aspect of The DAO hard fork that has been uncomfortable for many in the Ethereum community. “Why do they get screwed and people who put money in The DAO [don’t]?” he wondered aloud. “Is it because the [Ethereum] Foundation has a very close relationship to The DAO? Okay. Maybe; maybe not.”\n\nThe Bitcoin community (in general) thinks Ethereum’s bailing out of DAO token holders goes against the point of a blockchain, but Hoskinson sees a new opportunity for a third generation of blockchains, which implicitly include a model for governance. Tezos was one such project mentioned by Hoskinson during his presentation, although he also noted these sorts of governances models can be backported to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other public blockchains.']"

Lasting about three hours, the hearing demonstrated a mixture of genuine interest and skepticism on the part of committee members.\n\nIt was the first major committee discussion of the technology within Parliament, and follows a period of growing interest within the UK government to pursue possible applications.\n\nIn addition to Broadbent, witnesses who spoke included Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters (who spoke via phone); 11:FS co-founder and director of blockchain Simon Taylor; Imperial College Centre for Cryptocurrency Research associate director Dr Catherine Mulligan; Gresham College professor of commerce Michael Mainelli; and PwC transformation and assurance director Lord Spens.\n\nDuring his appearance, Broadbent discussed both the concept of a central bank issued digital currency – which he indicated is an evolving, years-long process – as well as the technology’s broader impact on financial markets.\n\nBroadbent went on to frame the conversation about blockchain within a broader question of how financial markets should be structured at all, telling committee members:\n\n""When you think of things on these scales, the benefits are clear and quite large, and so are the costs. And what I was really trying to say is, even though this is a very new technology, I think it\'s possible, once you think through, to realize that some of the big questions involved are very old, not to say ancient.""\n\nOn bitcoin\n\nCommittee members asked a number of questions about bitcoin, though at times the digital currency was branded as ""anonymous"" (bitcoin is by design a pseudonymous system).\n\nThe topic came up when one member asked how the Bank of England would operate a central-bank issued digital currency.\n\nBroadbent dismissed the idea that the Bank of England would use a similar model, indicating that any network, if it came to fruition, would be a permissioned one.\n\n""We would never have a system like that,"" he said.\n\nHe elaborated on this point during the hearing, suggesting that market participants wouldn\'t want an open, permissionless system when asked whether financial institutions might use a bitcoin-like system to escape regulatory scrutiny Further, he indicated that financial system players would prefer one that includes oversight from regulators.\n\n""I don\'t think that\'s what we would be most worried about, because I think people would want us involved,"" he added.\n\nDoubts raised about welfare trial\n\nOne notable moment in the hearing came during the second of three sessions, when the topic of a welfare payments proof-of-concept developed for the UK government’s Department of Works and Pensions was criticized by some members as ethically unsound.\n\nCommittee member and former UK chancellor Alistair Darling was vocally critical of the move, echoing past concerns raised by privacy advocates in the country.\n\n""It does raise an ethical issue as to whether the state should know if someone is spending money on one thing or another,"" he said.\n\nIn the back-and-forth that followed, Mulligan suggested that, according to her best knowledge, the proof-of-concept calls for an opt-in approach that wouldn’t require such oversight. That said, she conceded that there are privacy concerns that need to be worked through before such a system becomes production-ready.\n\nMulligan told the committee:\n\n""There are, really, a number of profound issues that need to be looked at from a regulatory perspective, and also these kind of moral and ethical questions, it raises them, very large questions for our society if we wish to use these technologies.""\n\nFor more details about today\'s hearing, check out CoinDesks\'s live blog coverage.\n\nImage via Parliament\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

(I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.""\n\nMany of Satoshi\'s public comments and explanations have a strange prescience to them. Six years after his post, Bitcoin has indeed ""somehow"" acquired a market value -- so it\'s being used as currency; a rare item that can be shuttled around the Internet as intermediate commodity money.\n\nDigital gold, as much as that phrase perturbs the committed gold bugs, appears to describe the Bitcoin valuation phenomenon better than high flying academic theories.\n\nThere\'s a clear need for rare, easily transportable digital gold.\n\nAnd someone invented it.\n\nSo it follows, sooner or later, someone will use it.

Why not? Therefore, we are formulating the law in such a way in order to allow buying cryptocurrencies for foreign operations and allow Russian citizens to sell bitcoins for profit reasons in foreign countries.""\n\nMoiseev also clarified that, at present, there is nothing preventing the use of bitcoin domestically, and that the intent isn’t to limit development of blockchain technology, but prevent its use from threatening the ruble.\n\n""We must remove responsibility for bitcoin emission from data operators in order to avoid risk of their punishment,"" Moiseev told the news source.\n\nHe said an updated version of the law could be submitted to the state law-making body, the Duma, before the end of 2016.\n\nImage via Rossiyskaya Gazeta\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But you can buy foreign currency, put it in your pocket and go abroad. Therefore, we are currently working on precise definitions in the bill, so that it will be possible to buy or sell bitcoins.”\n\nHowever, Minister Moiseev clarified that cryptocurrency mining is illegal in the country because it goes against the country’s constitution which states that Ruble is the only currency accepted by the country.\n\n""According to the constitution, the only currency in the country is the ruble. Its sole issuer is the Bank of Russia. Thus, the issue of any other currency is illegal,” he added.\n\nThe highly anticipated statement of the Ministry of Finance is suspected to spur the growth of Bitcoin in Russia significantly. According to Boris Titov, the Presidential Commissioner for Entrepreneurs’ Rights in Russia and the Leader of Right Cause party, Russian agencies estimate that there around two million bitcoin wallets held or opened by Russian users.\n\n“We [Party of Growth] estimate that over 2 million Russian citizens have opened their own Bitcoin wallets,” saidTitov in an interview with TASS Russian news agency.\n\nBitcoin Made Legal While Mainstream Payment Networks Threatened\n\nWhile some positivity in the Russian Bitcoin industry brightened the Bitcoin community this week, mainstream payment outlets and networks including QIWI and Skrill are being threatened by the Russian government’s media-watchdog, Roskomnadzor.\n\nAs stated in CoinTelegraph’s previous article.QIWI and Skrill have been put on the official list of banned websites for containing opportunities to participate in gambling.\n\nAlthough experts like Investors’ Angel CEO Addy Creeze believe the threats will diminish in the near future, the banning of mainstream payment networks shows a glimpse of the tight and strict financial regulations in Russia, which makes the government’s decision to legalize Bitcoin trading even more significant.', 'In the aftermath of bitcoin\'s \'halving\' on 9th July, market experts have begun to take positions on whether they believe the digital currency’s price will rise or fall in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nLong a matter of discussion in bitcoin\'s trading community, market observers had been anticipating the event, which saw the number of new bitcoins issued per transaction block reduced from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC, for years, and had been eager to see how it may affect both trading and the larger sentiments of investors.\n\nAny anxieties have now been eased, as one week after the change, the halving has been seen by many a non-event in terms of price or overall impact on the network.\n\nWhile the digital currency experienced, by bitcoin standards, a modest decline following the event (falling to $626.87 on 9th July, a figure that was 5.7% below the opening price), bitcoin prices have remained relatively stable.\n\nSince then, prices have continued to build gains, rising to a press time total of $668.75, and going forward, many market observers suggest gains are likely to continue.\n\nGains ahead?\n\nMarket observer Joe Lee, co-founder and CIO of digital currency trading platform Magnr, for example, expects to see a ""slow and steady"" rise in the price to coincide with new confidence in the system.\n\n""[The halving] represents a new level of maturity and stability in bitcoin’s blockchain,"" Lee told CoinDesk.\n\nLee said any gains are likely to be a reflection of new demand from those who were reluctant to invest before what was perceived to be a major event in the digital currency’s calendar.\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, identified a separate source of potential bitcoin gains by pointing to new macroeconomic concerns.\n\nWhile some observers said China and \'the Brexit\' drove much of this activity, Hayes said he believes bitcoin could see upside market moves in the near future as a result of Bank of Japan (BOJ) monetary stimulus.\n\nAs the BOJ employs further monetary easing, a weaker yen could help fuel gains in bitcoin.\n\n""The markets are focused on whether Japan will take Bernanke\'s advice and directly monetize Abe-san\'s proposed fiscal stimulus,"" he stated. ""Should the BOJ embark down this path, it will flood the global markets with more free money.""\n\nBlock debate\n\nBitcoin could also enjoy some upside based on what progress the community makes toward solving the block size debate.\n\nCurrently, each bitcoin transaction block has a maximum limit of 1 MB of data, a figure that a vocal component of the community has alleged is preventing or limiting wider consumer adoption.\n\nKong Gao, overseas marketing manager at bitcoin trader Richfund, weighed in on this highly visible issue, telling CoinDesk that it is not as big of a problem as some many believe.\n\nHe also emphasized his preference for focusing on block efficiency instead of size.\n\n""Scaling up does not solve the problem, it\'s just kicking the can down the road,"" said Gao. ""Making blocks more efficient is a better area we should direct our energy and discussions toward.""\n\nLee also emphasized the key role the block size debate could play in the bitcoin community, and how it could create uncertainty for traders.\n\n""Our eyes are on growth in underlying demand with the next major trading event being speculation around the uncertainty provided by the block size debate. With there being two clear camps, contention is inevitable,"" he said.\n\nLong wagers\n\nAnother factor that could affect bitcoin prices going forward is speculative leveraged trading.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, spoke with CoinDesk about how market activity has cooled down a bit following the halving. Even so, speculative bets have been primarily bullish, he emphasized.\n\n""Long-short positions seem to have stabilized around 72% in favor of longs, but most of those are residual longs from before the halving,"" he told CoinDesk on 14th June.\n\nHe continued:\n\n""For a true mean reversion and ‘resolution’ of the halving event with respect to market dynamics, these residual longs would need to close, either through a long squeeze (sharp selling) or a pump enticing traders to close at a profit.”\n\nWhile a short-term price increase may not be forthcoming, market observers said investors should keep in mind that bitcoin prices have enjoyed a steady, upward movement over time.\n\nMarket image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'In 2008, short of sending a suitcase full of cash, there was essentially just one way for an individual to send money between, say, the United States and Europe. You had to wire the money through a mainstream financial service, like Western Union or a bank. That meant paying high fees and waiting up to several days for the money to arrive.\n\nA radically new option arose in 2009 with the introduction of bitcoin. Bitcoin makes it possible to transfer value between two individuals anywhere in the world quickly and at minimal cost. It is often called a “cryptocurrency,” as it is purely digital and uses cryptography to protect against counterfeiting. The software that executes this cryptography runs simultaneously on computers around the world. Even if one or more of these computers is misused in an attempt to corrupt the bitcoin network (such as to steal money), the collective action of the others ensures the integrity of the system as a whole. Its distributed nature also enables bitcoin to process transactions without the fees, antiquated networks and (for better or worse) the rules governing intermediaries like banks and wire services.\n\nBitcoin’s exciting history and social impact have fired imaginations. The aggregate market value of all issued bitcoins today is roughly US$10 billion. The computing devices that maintain its blockchain are geographically dispersed and owned by thousands of different individuals, so the bitcoin network has no single owner or point of control. Even its creator remains a mystery (despite many efforts to unmask her, him or them). Bitcoin’s lack of government regulation made it attractive to black markets and malware writers. Although the core system is well-secured, people who own bitcoins have experienced a litany of heists and fraud.\n\nEven more than the currency itself, though, what has drawn the world’s attention are the unprecedented reliability and security of bitcoin’s underlying transaction system, called a blockchain. Researchers, entrepreneurs, and developers believe that blockchains will solve a stunning array of problems, such as stabilization of financial systems, identification of stateless persons, establishing title to real estate and media, and efficiently managing supply chains.\n\nUnderstanding the blockchain\n\nDespite its richly varied applications, a blockchain such as bitcoin’s aims to realize a simple goal. Abstractly, it can be viewed as creating a kind of public bulletin board, often called a “distributed ledger.” This ledger is public. Anyone – plebeian or plutocrat, baker or banker – can read it. And anyone can write valid data to it. Specifically, in bitcoin, any owner of money can add a transaction to the ledger that transfers some of her money to someone else. The bitcoin network makes sure that the ledger includes only authorized transactions, meaning those digitally signed by the owners of the money being transferred.\n\nThe key feature of blockchains is that new data may be written at any time, but can never be changed or erased. At first glance, this etched-in-stone rule seems a needless design restriction. But it gives rise to a permanent, ever-growing transactional history that creates strong transparency and accountability. For example, the bitcoin blockchain contains a record of every transaction in the system since its birth. This feature makes it possible to prevent account holders from reneging on transactions, even if their identities remain anonymous. Once in the ledger, a transaction is undeniable. The indelible nature of the ledger is much more powerful and general, though, allowing blockchains to support applications well beyond bitcoin.\n\nConsider, for example, the management of title to a piece of land or property. Property registries in many parts of the world today are fragmented, incomplete, poorly maintained, and difficult to access. The legal uncertainty surrounding ownership of property is a major impediment to growth in developing economies. Were property titles authoritatively and publicly recorded on a blockchain, anyone could learn instantly who has title to a piece of property. Even legitimate anonymous ownership – as through a private trust – could be recorded on a blockchain.\n\nSuch transparency would help resolve legal ambiguity and shed light on malfeasance. Advocates envision similar benefits in blockchain recording of media rights – such as rights to use images or music – identity documents and shipping manifests. In addition, the decentralized nature of the database provides resilience not just to technical failures, but also to political ones – failed states, corruption and graft.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nBlockchains can be enhanced to support not just transactions, but also pieces of code known as smart contracts. A smart contract is a program that controls assets on the blockchain – anything from cryptocurrency to media rights – in ways that guarantee predictable behavior. A smart contract may be viewed as playing the role of a trusted third party: Whatever task it is programmed to do, it will carry out faithfully.\n\nSuppose for example that a user wishes to auction off a piece of land for which her rights are represented on a blockchain. She could hire an auctioneer, or use an online auction site. But that would require her and her potential customers to trust, without proof, that the auctioneer conducts the auction honestly.\n\nTo achieve greater transparency, the user could instead create a smart contract that executes the auction automatically. She would program the smart contract with the ability to deliver the item to be sold and with rules about minimum bids and bidding deadlines. She would also specify what the smart contract is to do at the end of the auction: send the winning bid amount from the winner to the seller’s account and transfer the land title to the winner.\n\nBecause the blockchain is publicly visible, anyone with suitable expertise could check that the code in the smart contract implements a fair and valid auction. Auction participants would only need to trust the correctness of the code. They wouldn’t need to rely on an auctioneer to run the auction honestly – and as an added benefit, they also wouldn’t need to pay high auctioneer fees.\n\nHandling confidentiality\n\nBehind this compelling vision lurk many technical challenges. The transparency and accountability of a fully public ledger have many benefits, but are at odds with confidentiality. Suppose the seller mentioned above wanted to conduct a sealed-bid auction or conceal the winning bid amount? How could she do this on a blockchain that everyone can read? Achieving both transparency and confidentiality on blockchains is in fact possible, but requires new techniques under development by researchers.\n\nAnother challenge is ensuring that smart contracts correctly reflect user intent. A lawyer, arbiter or court can remedy defects or address unforeseen circumstances in written contracts. Smart contracts, though, are expressly designed as unalterable code. This inflexibility avoids ambiguity and cheating and ensures trustworthy execution, but it can also cause brittleness. An excellent example was the recent theft of around $55 million in cryptocurrency from a smart contract. The thief exploited a software bug, and the smart contract creators couldn’t fix it once the contract was running.\n\nBitcoin is a proof of concept of the viability of blockchains. As researchers and developers overcome the technical challenges of smart contracts and other blockchain innovations, marveling at money flying across the Atlantic will someday seem quaint.\n\nAri Juels, Professor of Computer Science, Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute, Cornell Tech, and Co-Director, Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3), Cornell University and Ittay Eyal, Research Associate, Computer Science and Associate Director, Initiative For Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3), Cornell University. This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.', 'No new technology since the dawn of the internet has captured the imagination like blockchain.\n\nDesigned to run unregulated electronic currency, the blockchain is promoted by many as having far broader potential in government, identity, voting, corporate administration and healthcare, to name just some of the proposed use cases. But these grand designs misunderstand what blockchain actually does.\n\nBlockchain is certainly important and valuable, as an inspiration for brand new internet protocols and infrastructure. But it’s a lot like the Wright Brothers’ Flyer, the first powered aeroplane. It’s wondrous but impractical.\n\nNot quite eight years ago, in November 2008, a mysterious and still unknown developer going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin –- the first practical electronic cash that didn’t rely on a digital reserve bank. A decentralised crypto-currency scheme requires global consensus on when someone spends a virtual coin, so she cannot spend it again. Blockchain’s trick is to broadcast every single bitcoin transaction to the whole community, which then in effect votes on the order in which transactions appear. Any attempt to “double spend” (move the same bitcoin twice), or to introduce a counterfeit coin that hasn’t been seen on the network before, is detected and rejected.\n\nWith no umpire, the continuous arbitration of blockchain entries requires a massive peer-to-peer network in order to resist distortion or manipulation.\n\nAnyone at all is free to join the blockchain network, as a holder and spender of currency, and/or as a node contributing to the consensus process. The incentive to participate comes in the form of a random reward paid whenever the ledger is settled, which is roughly every 10 minutes. The odds of a node winning the reward go up with the amount of computing power it adds to the network, and so running a node is dubbed bitcoin “mining”.\n\nThe only authoritative record of anyone’s bitcoin balance is held on the blockchain. Account holders operate a wallet application, which shows their balance and lets them spend it, moving bitcoin to other accounts. Counter-intuitively, these “wallets” hold no money; all they do is control account holders’ private keys, and provide a user interface to what’s in the blockchain.\n\nIn fact bitcoin is entirely ethereal, with not even virtual coins. The Blockchain only records the movement of bitcoin in and out of account holders’ wallets, and calculates virtual balances as the difference between what’s been spent and what’s been paid.\n\nThe only way to spend your balance is to use your private key, to digitally sign an instruction to the network, specifying the amount to move, and the address (that is, the public key) of where to move it to. If a private key is lost or destroyed, then the balance associated with that key is frozen forever and can never be spent. Ever.\n\nThere has been a string of notorious mishaps where computers or disk drives holding bitcoin wallets have been lost, together with millions of dollars of value they controlled. And predictably, numerous pieces of malicious software have been developed specifically to steal bitcoin private keys and balances.\n\nThe enthusiasm for crypto-currency innovation has proven infectious; the feeling is that if blockchain “squared the circle” in payments, then it must have untold powers in other domains.\n\nIn particular, many commentators have promoted blockchain for identity management.\n\nThe conspicuous thing about proposals to put “identity on the blockchain” is that they overwhelmingly come from blockchain advocates and not identity management experts. What’s missing in the great majority of blockchain-for-identity proposals – and indeed in most of the non-payments use cases – is a careful statement of the problem and proper analysis of why distributed consensus is important.\n\nWhat the blockchain can’t do\n\nSadly, when you look closely, the blockchain just doesn’t do what most people seem to think it does. There is nothing “on” the blockchain. All it holds is a record of bitcoin movements and associated metadata. The metaphor of recording anything “on” it belies the need for additional technologies and processes over and above blockchain, to decide how to represent physical items in code and to oversee the assignment of those codes. These necessitate extra key management, registration of ownership, and governance.\n\nBlockchain does nothing about these realities, neither does any other distributed ledger technology that has followed in bitcoin’s wake. Blockchain was expressly designed to manage crypto-currency without any key management or registration. No one is trusted in the naked bitcoin world. No administrator and no third party is needed to vouch for any wallet holder or network node. The lack of friction is great for the unbanked (as well as illicit users) and it also helps build the peer-to-peer network, which must be maintained at a huge scale in order to guard against those untrusted participants conspiring against the system.\n\nAnd it’s best to remember that the incentive to run blockchain nodes comes from the mining reward. Take bitcoin away from non-payment use cases and it’s unclear who will pay for the infrastructure, and how. The original blockchain is not separable from bitcoin. Now, there is certainly plenty of fresh research and development being done on alternative consensus mechanisms and participation models. But nothing yet is up and running like the established public blockchain, and nothing else has yet been proven with blockchain’s security properties.\n\nBlockchain does just one thing: it establishes the order of entries in a distributed ledger, so as to prevent double spend without an umpire. The truth of the contents of the ledger is an entirely different matter. Blockchain doesn’t magically make the entries themselves trustworthy, let alone the people that created them.\n\nDespite the hype, blockchain is not a “trust protocol”; it’s actually the opposite. Just think about it: it’s not as though paying by bitcoin stops you from being ripped off. For anything of value other than bitcoin to be transacted via the blockchain requires additional layers of agents, third parties and auditors – things that just don’t square with the trust-free architecture.\n\nLofty claims are made for blockchain’s ability to decentralise all sorts of things. But in truth, blockchain only decentralises the adjudication of the order of entries in a ledger. It is not a general or native “Internet of Value” as claimed by authors like Don and Alex Tapscott. It was expressly designed for electronic cash; it has no native connection to real world assets.\n\nFew businesses have escaped the call to evaluate blockchain technologies. If you’ve been persuaded to have a look, then as a first step, re-examine your security and record keeping needs. Take the time to understand what blockchain does, and all the things it leaves to be done by other systems. If your business is decentralised and your assets are purely digital, then blockchain has a lot to offer, but otherwise, it’s just another database.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Blockchain technology also permits tracking diamonds and other goods where buyers want to know the origins and previous owners, Bill Fearnley Jr., a research director at International Data Corp., told The Wall Street Journal. “Valuable assets of any kind could be tracked better, with an unerasable history, on a blockchain,” said Fearnley.\n\nEverledger, a company focused on ensuring authenticity and minimizing fraud in the international trade of diamonds, fine art and luxury goods, leverages blockchain technology to protect suppliers, buyers and shippers against theft, counterfeiting and other forms of corruption. Everledger is building a business network using IBM Blockchain to power its global certification system that demonstrates the origin of high-value goods and tracks them through the supply chain.\n\n""When you are in the business of provenance, secured records, access and transparency are everything. There is no compromise when it comes to security and one cannot underestimate the expertise required to enable this,"" said Leanne Kemp, founder and CEO of Everledger. ""Having the opportunity to build, test, scale and refine Everledger on IBM Blockchain, underpinned by a security-rich infrastructure, is a game changer. It has accelerated our ability to move fast and deliver the most innovative solutions to our partners internationally and confidentially.""\n\nThe new secure cloud blockchain environment is based on IBM’s LinuxONE, a Linux-only server designed for high-security projects. “IBM clients rely on the enterprise-grade platform for Linux technology as a trustful, reliable and highly secure system to confidently deploy business-essential applications, optimize operating costs and achieve seamless infrastructure growth,” notes a LinuxONE white paper. “IBM LinuxONE systems and solutions provide users with a flexible yet powerful infrastructure that helps ensure that a business receives the performance, reliability, security and processing power it needs to address increasingly sophisticated and demanding application requirements.”\n\nBased on the IBM z13 introduced earlier this year, the LinuxONE Emperor can scale up to 8,000 virtual machines or thousands of containers. IBM says that the Emperor system has the fastest processor in the industry and is optimized for the new application economy and hybrid cloud era. The new secure cloud blockchain services are currently in limited beta.\n\nThe latest version of IBM Blockchain is available through Bluemix, IBM’s cloud platform. Based on open standards, Bluemix is one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world, featuring tools and services spanning categories of big data, mobile, Watson, analytics, integration, DevOps, security and the Internet of Things (IoT). IBM blockchain software is developed in the framework of the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project, a collaborative effort started in December, to establish, build and sustain an open source non-Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn February, Bitcoin Magazine reported that IBM was deploying a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) for developers and making tens of thousands of lines of code available to the Hyperledger Project. In April, IBM announced new cloud services based on the company’s Hyperledger code and Bluemix. Recently, IBM announced two high-profile cloud blockchain projects developed by Mizuho Financial Group in Japan and Crédit Mutuel Arkéa in France.\n\nCIO Magazine notes that a data breach in a blockchain project could be potentially devastating. Therefore, it’s important to find ways to maximize the security and compliance of the technology for business-critical applications. “The average total cost of a data breach for enterprises reached $4 million last year and with security incidents up by 64 percent in 2015, the risks are higher than ever,” notes the IBM press release. “Security is critical — not just within the blockchain itself but with all the technology touching the ledger.”\n\nIn its effort to become one of the top players in the emerging sector of distributed ledger technology for the enterprise, IBM is leveraging its established market — large firms with high-security concerns and a need for transparent compliance with regulations — and the fast-emerging trend toward cloud computing.\n\nPhoto Clockready / Creative Commons', 'A Washington State utility is raising rates on bitcoin miners, months after a dispute with the local industry began over its power usage.\n\nThe Chelan County Public Utility District (PUD) announced earlier this week that, effective January 2017, electrical rates will rise for so-called ""high-density load customers"", or those that use 250 kilowatt hours per square foot per year. The definition, as stated by the PUD, is intended specifically to cover server farms and bitcoin mines, or data centers that specifically service network transactions.\n\nThe increase won\'t be immediately felt by the region’s bitcoin miners, however, as the PUD said that a five-year transition period is being initiated for existing customers who can show they’ve made ""substantial investment"" and meet additional criteria.\n\nThe process dates back several years, to when the industrial bitcoin mining boom began. At the time, several firms sought to establish a presence in the hydroelectric power-rich Chelan County. A reported influx of phone calls and on-site visits by prospective bitcoin miners prompted PUD officials to put a moratorium on new high-density load customers in late 2014.\n\nBitcoin miners run high-powered machinery in a race to discover the next block of transactions, a process for which they earn rewards from the network. Cheaper power means more profitability for miners, and some of the least expensive electricity can be found in Washington State, particularly in places like Chelan.\n\nPUD representatives said in statements that they believe the rate increase is a fair one, resulting from months of discussion between utility officials and members of the public.\n\n""There was a lot of individual and collective effort involved in bringing this proposal forward, and I think it\'s a good product,"" Commissioner Dennis Bolz said in a statement.\n\nIt’s not yet clear how bitcoin miners in the region are taking the news. Phone calls to miners in Chelan County were not immediately returned.\n\nIn interviews with CoinDesk earlier this year, miners working both in Chelan and in nearby counties criticized the planned rate increase harshly, with at least one suggesting that the move could put them out of business.\n\nChelan county image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

For those not in the know, CCN ran a piece in January 2014, immediately after his arrest that detailed how Charlie Shrem had done nothing wrong.\n\n“A few weeks ago, I was released from Lewisburg FPC. I want to thank the hundreds of people who wrote, sent books, money, magazines and their support. There are no words to describe my appreciation and affection to all of you. Thank you so much.” wrote Shrem in a public blog post yesterday, the first since his release. A picture of Shrem with his girlfriend Courtney Warner accompanied the post.\n\nThe rest of his post read:\n\nCurrently, I’m home in southern Pennsylvania where Courtney and I have relocated temporarily. We will spend the summer months enjoying the outdoors, good food, family, friends and the small things that I missed while I was away, and at the same time transition back into normal life. I’m grateful for the opportunity to be back home.\n\nI’m excited to move forward onto new projects and looking forward to seeing what everyone has been working on!\n\nFeel free to reach out if you’d like to say hello!\n\nCharlie\n\nCharlie Shrem was arrested in January 2014 at JFK airport in New York, accused of knowingly allowing a user from the now-defunct darknet marketplace Silk Road to trade bitcoin through the now-defunct bitcoin exchange BitInstant, which Shrem founded and was the chief executive of. He was charged with conspiring to sell over $1 million in bitcoins to Silk Road users, and a US district judge ordered him in Manhattan to forfeit $950,000.\n\nThe accusation against Shrem, fundamentally, was that he willfully neglected to report unlawful transactions that were conducted through BitIstant by Silk Road user Robert Faiella, aka BTCKing. The latter was sentenced to four years in prison in January 2015.\n\nFor his part, Shrem was formally indicted in April 2014, following an unsuccessful plea bargain. Come December 2014, Shrem was sentenced to two years in prison\n\nShrem was under house arrest for 14 months since the arrest and surrendered himself to Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp in Pennsylvania on March 30, 2015.\n\nAlthough a free man, Shrem is still subject to certain communication requirements established for his incarceration which prevent him from doing any media interviews at this time.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Bitcoin “halvening” happened last week—an event within the Bitcoin protocol where a new Bitcoin mining era started with the mining reward dropping to 12.5 BTC from 25 BTC. Speculation before the event held that something might happen to the market, economy or community; but so far, very little has changed in reaction.\n\nAfter the Ethereum DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization) attack with millions of dollars’ worth of ETH stolen, the Ethereum community has successfully executed a hardfork to secure the stolen funds. Keep reading for resources and details about that hardfork and the events leading up to it.\n\nEver wondered if you can live on only bitcoins? Bitcoin programmer Felix Weis answered that question in part by roaming the world for 18 months using only bitcoins to pay his way. Netki CEO spoke up at a conference suggesting that pokémon could be added to the blockchain (not a new suggestion, but still worth mulling over). Bitcoin mining equipment maker Bitmain acquires blockchain data analysis company Blocktrail.\n\nFinally, Charlie Shrem, CEO of now-defunct Bitcoin exchange BitInstant has been released from a two-year jail sentence he received after being charged with money laundering.\n\nAs for the market, Bitcoin value is currently at $667.59 (BitcoinAverage.com) after showing a two percent dip from $677 over the last four hours. As for a weekly review of the price, the current market value is very close to what it was seven days ago. The market rose up above $685 during July 17; but fell once again back down to its more familiar price.\n\nBitcoin’s second “Halvening” came and went and not much happened\n\nLast week saw something that seemed like it would be a momentous event for the Bitcoin market: the block discovery reward was halved, reducing to 12.5 BTC from 25 BTC. This is a planned event that is effected by the very code that runs the Bitcoin protocol, as more Bitcoins are mined (by way of miners securing blocks onto the Bitcoin blockchain) every so many the number rewarded will halve until eventually blocks will no longer produce rewards. This is because the pool of total bitcoins has a set limit at 21 million that will never be changed.\n\nThe halving event came and went on July 9, 2016. Not much happened to the market, the hashrate of miners working to add blocks to the blockchain or the economy and community in general.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin Magazine examining the lack of reaction, the market exchange rate did not change as a result of the halving event—but the market value did increase before the halving in anticipation of the event. The current market value has been hovering around $673 (up only a little from $650 right before the event). However, on the run up to July, the Bitcoin market value rose approximately 50 percent from $450 in the three months before the event.\n\nHash rate, a metric that can help designate the health of the blockchain by measuring how much computational power miners are aiming at discovering blocks (and thus earning bitcoins as reward), did not change very much either. According to Bitcoin Magazine, the hash rate did not change much at all—dipping as little as one percent or less. It was predicted that some miners might drop out, or increase their power to make up for the half-reward, but the birds-eye view of the hash rate shares has not changed very much.\n\nFinally, coupled with fears that miners might drop out with the reduction of potential profits from mining, are predictions about the stability of the network. So far, this has not happened, as Bitcoin market volatility still remains fairly smoothed out, hash rate has not changed and the number of miners has not changed that much.\n\nIt could be too early to tell if there will be an impact, only a week and a half in. Miners would have already bought their mining equipment, the reward-halving event has been known for years (and its date of effect easily predicted) and miners would already have their equipment bought and paid for, rent paid, and electricity predicted for the month. It will likely take a few months for the running costs to catch up with sunk costs such as mining equipment.\n\nEthereum hardfork successfully occurs\n\nYesterday, the Ethereum blockchain executed a hard fork, a modification to the codebase that changed how blocks are processed in such a way that blocks on the previous codebase cannot be processed, at block number 1920000. This hardfork was supported by 87 percent of ETH holders with 80 percent of the miners voting in favor. The intent of the fork, which began as controversial, was intended to resolve a problem that arose in the Ethereum DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization), where a thief used an exploit in the code of the DAO to begin stealing millions of dollars worth of ETH.\n\nAccording to Crypto Coins News, the Ethereum market price jumped yesterday when it became clear that the hardfork was about certain; then once the hardfork was completed, the price made a significant leap.\n\nThis decision is interesting for the cryptocurrency and blockchain-based technology development community as it shows that through majority consensus the rules upon which a blockchain runs can be changed. It’s important to note that this fork did not modify the past transactions on the blockchain (they remain secure and unchanged); instead the fork addresses the problem that allowed the theft of ETH from the DAO and transferred the stolen ETH tokens from the bad DAO to a newly formed “whitehat DAO.”\n\nThe details of the hardfork are available on Ethereum’s blog where Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, explains how it worked and why it was necessary.\n\n“The recovery contract is already returning DAO token holders’ ether,” said Buterin about the hardfork’s protocol and execution; “about 4.5 million ETH has been sent to DAO token holders, and about 463000 ETH is in the control of the curator; a contract to facilitate extrabalance payments is currently undergoing security review.”\n\n“Although some do question the analogy ‘code is law’. I do not,” said Christoph Jentzsch, Slock.it UG (operator of the Ethereum DAO) Founder and CEO on Reddit about the fork. “We just found out that we have a supreme court, the community!”\n\nBitcoin programmer Felix Weis spent 18 months going around the world using only Bitcoin\n\nOn January 12, 2015 Felix Weis, Bitcoin programmer and evangelist, decided to attempt to go around the world using only bitcoins to pay his way. His trip ended 18 months later in July 2016 after visiting 27 countries and 50 cities; his story is told by Forbes reporter Laura Shin.\n\nWeis acted with only three rules for his trip:\n\nNo banks. And that meant no Western Union, no money exchanges, no converting USD to euros, no euros to yen. Bitcoin first. He had to use Bitcoin whenever possible. Cash only for bitcoin. Recognizing that there would be times when he would need local currency, he allowed himself to do peer-to-peer exchanges of bitcoin for cash. And that led to some fun adventures.\n\nAccording to Weis, in order to make ends meet in each city he visited he used Coinmap, an ever-growing map of businesses accepting bitcoins to find places to stay and places to eat.\n\n“In terms of lodging, I did everything from couch surfing to five star hotels. I paid for all the flights and hotels with Bitcoin,” Weis said. “If the hotel didn’t accept Bitcoin directly, I used Expedia, and for the flights, I used CheapAir. I would like to thank these two companies because they helped me a lot.”\n\nWeis said he also leaned heavily on members of the Bitcoin community in the various different countries he visited. Eighty percent of the people he traded with were already into Bitcoin, he explained, and he found them using LocalBitcoins, a website dedicated to helping people exchange bitcoins locally. He even traded bitcoins with some people for cash (some who had been as-yet unaware of Bitcoin).\n\nOn the start of his trip, Weis began in Prague, where SatoshiLabs SA is headquartered—SatoshiLabs is the producer of the TREZOR Bitcoin hardware wallet. Weis says that he wanted to purchase a hardware wallet to keep his bitcoins safe during his trip. Weis explained he kept the bulk of his bitcoin savings in the wallet; but he kept a spending stipend on a mobile wallet (on his smartphone); for this purpose he used a variety of wallets such as Android Bitcoin Wallet, Mycelium and Copay.\n\nOn his trip, Weis interviewed numerous Bitcoin startups around the world and asked them where they expected to be with cryptocurrency in 10 years. While he intended to keep a record of these interviews, he has not published anything. “I’m a programmer, not a blogger,” he said. “People kept telling me, You have to write a blog, but my blog died after one month. It was so much work.”\n\nMore details of Weis’s cryptocurrency-fuel globetrotting adventure are posted in the Forbes article about his trip, including how he chose where to go, what he did when he got there and more of what he learned. The entire article is worth the time to read it.\n\nPokémon strikes again: Justin Newton, CEO of Netki, proposed putting pokémon on the blockchain\n\nFortune magazine reporter Robert Hackett wrote up some of the broad strokes that came out of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference this week. During the proceedings Justin Newton, CEO of Netki Inc., proposed putting Nintendo Co. Ltd.’s famous Pokémon video game IP on the Bitcoin blockchain. Netki recently raised $3.5 million USD in a seed round to provide human-readable wallet addresses for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nNewton is not making a totally unprecedented suggestion; blockchain-technology is an excellent mechanism for providing secure provenance for virtual property. In Nintendo’s Pokémon games, the eponymous digital animals “pokémon” act as a sort of virtual property that the games urge players to collect and upgrade (or in Pokémon parlance “evolve”).\n\nAs an intellectual property Pokémon has built up a virtual empire for Nintendo of TV shows, movies and video games. And now, with the recent advent of the augmented reality mobile video game Pokémon GO, developed by Niantic Labs, it has given the property a giant explosion in popularity. According to figures taken from the Google Play store installs of the game have reached almost 50 million users since the game’s launch on July 6 (the game also has an iOS version).\n\nThe best example of a video game that uses a blockchain to store cryptographic proof of ownership is Spells of Genesis (SoG) developed and published by EverdreamSoft SA. SoG is a collectable trading card game (TCG) that uses a minor arcade element to allow people to play using the cards they collect. The cards themselves are virtual property assets secured on a blockchain and can be traded between users or transformed into other cards or other cryptocurrency tokens.\n\nVirtual property collection games are a perfect use for the cryptographic security of proof-of-ownership that blockchain-based technology can provide. A well-secured blockchain, such as the Bitcoin blockchain, can also provide a level of tamper-proofing by making sure that assets could not be easily counterfeited or duplicated (this is a problem common to virtual world economies such as seen in games such as Diablo 2).\n\nBitmain acquires blockchain data analysis and wallet API company Blocktrail\n\nYesterday, Bitcoin mining outfit Bitmain Technologies Ltd. announced the acquisition of blockchain data analysis and wallet API company Blocktrail B.V. This acquisition adds Blocktrail’s full featured multi-signature wallet API and blockchain explorer to Bitmain’s already extensive stable of Bitcoin services that include a Bitcoin mining equipment manufacture, a blockchain explorer, a cloud-mining outfit and the second-largest Bitcoin mining pool.\n\nJihan Wu, cofounder of Bitmain said, “Blocktrail’s products, services and team are highly valuable to us. We hope to utilize this acquisition to continue to offer better services and products to BTC.com’s customers worldwide.”\n\nAccording to a press release about the acquisition, Bitmain will be hiring on Blocktrail’s three current employees. The service will also continue Blocktrail’s current API and services as-is without any changes for current customers.\n\nFor more information, see Blocktrail’s blog for the announcement.\n\nJailed CEO of Bitcoin exchange BitInstant, Charlie Shrem released from prison\n\nCharlie Shrem, the CEO of now-defunct Bitcoin exchange BitInstant has been released from prison after serving most of a two-year jail sentence for money laundering and his involvement in the Silk Road black market.\n\n“Currently I’m home in southern Pennsylvania where Courtney and I have relocated temporarily,” Shrem wrote on his eponymous website about his freedom. “We will spend the summer months enjoying the outdoors, good food, family, friends and the small things that I missed while I was away, and at the same time transition back into normal life. I’m grateful for the opportunity to be back home.”\n\nShrem is not currently able to commit to media interviews at this time as he says he is under the same communication requirements he had when he was sentenced. Shrem’s Reddit account is /u/Bitcoin_Charlie and, at time of writing, he has posted twice there since his release.\n\nFeatured image credit: Bitcoin Logo, https://www.flickr.com/photos/thelastminute/12350379324.', 'Mr. Robot is a show built on hacks. The mother of all hacks serves as the big cliffhanger at the end of the show\'s first season, and nearly every plot development leading up to it was nudged along by some kind of exploit. It’s rare to get through an episode without at least one digital intrusion, often drawn from real life. Each week, we\'ll be running through Mr. Robot\'s C Y B E R activities — who got hacked, why, and how much magic would be required to make them actually work.\n\n* * * S P O I L E R S F O L L O W * * *\n\nIt’s been a bad week for fsociety. Elliot is still out of commission, glitching out in the pastoral refuge of Queens. Romero is dead, Mobley and Trenton are on their way out the door, and for the first time in the series, it looks like law enforcement might actually catch someone. The episode ends with special agent and devoted Alexa owner Dom DePierro stumbling onto fsociety’s Coney Island HQ, the first solid lead of the season.\n\nBut despite Elliot’s digital detox, the episode still managed to fit in a few good hacks, ranging from a booby-trapped computer to a catastrophically insolvent Bitcoin bank. So let’s see how they stacked up!\n\nMoney and health. Health and money. The one isn\'t too useful without the other.\n\n\n\nRay needs a new engineer. #MrRobot pic.twitter.com/DJONJ5NEHd — Mr. Robot (@whoismrrobot) July 21, 2016\n\nThe wallet is too hot\n\nIn one of the episode’s most ominous scenes, Craig Robinson’s Ray and a friend try to convince a badly beaten developer into restarting his Bitcoin service. Every time he starts it up, he explains, someone steals a bunch of money and crashes the server. The whole thing needs to be migrated to a new server and protected through rotating system of hot and cold wallets, which he’s not sharp enough to do on his own.\n\nFor anyone involved with Bitcoin, this scenario is so realistic it hurts. We’ve got all the familiar signs here: a naive developer playing with code he doesn’t understand, savvy thieves exploiting the vulnerabilities he doesn’t understand, and finally a squad of angry criminals descending on him for screwing up their meal ticket. Unfortunately, this sort of thing happens a lot — although physical violence is, as far as I know, still fairly rare.\n\nThe obvious comparison is Mt Gox, which flamed out spectacularly in 2014, leaving as much as $400 million in bitcoin missing in its wake. But while it’s the biggest bitcoin theft, it’s far from the only one, and similar thefts have hit both BitStamp and Ethereum’s DAO. Smaller-scale thefts have also happened on more conventional exchanges like Coinbase. In each case, it’s taken a lot of technical help to pick up the pieces.\n\nWhen a theft is big enough to bring down the entire marketplace, there are often a lot of angry criminals in the wings. The Silk Road and its successors were great places to sell drugs, and bitcoin is still the preferred currency for ransomware attacks. But you can’t make money if you can’t keep your wallets safe, so closing the bank usually stops the rackets, too. It’s not clear exactly what scam Ray is running and where it will go, but for now, the interesting thing is that Bitcoin — particularly the drugs-and-robbery side of Bitcoin — is at the center of a potentially major plotline.\n\nFire in the CPU\n\nAs the FBI starts to investigate Romero’s death, we get a reminder of just how good he was at covering his tracks. When the agents plug in his computer, it literally bursts into flames, just moments after DiPierro asked if they’d checked the ports for booby traps. This is what happens when you don’t listen to women!\n\nThis turns out to be a scenario that real-life hackers worry about all the time, and they’ve built lots of clever programs and devices to wipe a computer if it falls into the wrong hands. My personal favorite is a 2009 project called DECAF, so-named because it’s designed to nerf the COFEE forensics suite used by the FBI. There are also USB keys that will fry your computer into oblivion when you plug them in — and it’s easy to imagine the same system on a port rather than a stick. There are also self-destructing computer chips (courtesy of DARPA) and file structures that will delete your data if it falls into the wrong hands.\n\nOf course, none of those will make flames shoot of your fan vents. The most I could find on that was someone on Quora who suggested lining your hard drive with thermite, which seems like a wildly bad idea. With any of these systems, there’s a very real chance of accidentally blowing up your own computer and possibly yourself— but I suppose fsociety is used to living on the edge?\n\nR u a phreak\n\nThis isn’t really a hack, so much as some extremely vintage jargon that I simply could not ignore. In the cold open flashback, we see Mobley tempting Romero back into fsociety by saying that the group needs a phreaker, and he’s the best one around. There’s an Ocean’s Eleven vibe to the whole thing, which is particularly effective because ""phreaker"" sounds so cool.\n\nAs true \'90s kids know, phreakers specialized in breaking into the private networks run by the phone company, typically by masquerading the clicks, and beeps of a phone. It’s a fascinating chapter in hacking history, but most historians would tell you it peaked in the \'70s. (http://www.historyofphonephreaking.org/faq.php) As the old copper networks are replaced by fiber optics, most of the classic phreaker tricks have stopped working. Modern phones are just computers sending data over strands of glass like every other computer, and while you can still totally hack them, it’s not really phreaking in the classical sense.\n\nThat’s not to say Romero couldn’t be an expert phreaker! He’s old enough and could have spent years honing his skills. But what job is Mobley going into that requires hacking through a Clinton-era copper network? Or maybe the flashback was taking us a lot farther back than I thought?\n\nAs always, I only covered the hacks that jumped out to me, so let me know if there’s anything else that left you scratching your head, either in this episode or in the show more broadly. And if you’re curious about the rest of the show — like who killed Romero, what’s up with DiPierro’s Alexa, and where Tyrell has been this whole time — check out the Mr. Robot Digital After Show, embedded above.

Lolz — lily allen (@lilyallen) July 11, 2016\n\nIn January 2014, Allen admitted her regret at denying “hundreds of thousands of bitcoin” in exchange for an online concert. She was asked to live stream a concert to the virtual world called Second Life. The unknown organizer offered her bitcoin.\n\nShe hashtagged herself an “idiot.” The pop singer tweeted: “About five years ago someone asked me to stream a gig live for hundreds of thousNds of bitcoins, “as if” I said.”\n\nAbout 5 years ago someone asked me to stream a gig live on second life for hundreds of thousNds of bitcoins, ""as if"" I said. #idiot #idiot — lily allen (@lilyallen) January 5, 2014\n\nAllen must have come across a headline from the British news magazine, The Independent: “Pound sterling becomes more unstable than Bitcoin following Brexit.”\n\nThe paper writes about the volatility in the aftermath of Brexit on June 23. Pound sterling volatility more than doubled. News of Brexit, and a forthcoming technical event known as a block halving in the code, led to increase interested on Bitcoin around the time of Brexit.\n\nAs David Cameron steps down Wednesday, Theresa May has been named British Prime Minister. She has delivered a message of calm in the wake of Brexit.\n\n“I know I’m not a showy politician,” May said two weeks ago upon announcing her candidacy. “I don’t tour the television studios. I don’t gossip about people over lunch. I don’t go drinking in Parliament’s bars. I don’t often wear my heart on my sleeve. I just get on with the job in front of me.”\n\nAllen first burst into the music industry after her songs gained popularity on MySpace. Her musical styles range from reggae to electropop. She’s also launched her own record label. She titled her third album, “Sheezus,” a play on Kanye West’s “Yeezus.”\n\nAllen has criticized London Metropolitican Police for not acting in a case that saw Alex Gray stalk the singer for seven years. The stalker sent Allen’s mother emails saying he was going to kill a celebrity. She claims the Metropolitan Police of refusing to shower a picture of her stalker.\n\nShe also recently had a “large tax bill” which led UK press to speculate she was selling her UK mansion for 4.2 million pounds to help pay the bill. Claims which she denied.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Blockchain doesn’t magically make entries on a distributed ledger trustworthy. Credit: shutterstock.com No new technology since the dawn of the internet has captured the imagination like blockchain.\n\nDesigned to run unregulated electronic currency, the blockchain is promoted by many as having far broader potential in government, identity, voting, corporate administration and healthcare, to name just some of the proposed use cases. But these grand designs misunderstand what blockchain actually does.\n\nBlockchain is certainly important and valuable, as an inspiration for brand new internet protocols and infrastructure. But it\'s a lot like the Wright Brothers\' Flyer, the first powered aeroplane. It\'s wondrous but impractical.\n\nNot quite eight years ago, in November 2008, a mysterious and still unknown developer going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin –- the first practical electronic cash that didn\'t rely on a digital reserve bank. A decentralised crypto-currency scheme requires global consensus on when someone spends a virtual coin, so she cannot spend it again. Blockchain\'s trick is to broadcast every single bitcoin transaction to the whole community, which then in effect votes on the order in which transactions appear. Any attempt to ""double spend"" (move the same bitcoin twice), or to introduce a counterfeit coin that hasn\'t been seen on the network before, is detected and rejected.\n\nWith no umpire, the continuous arbitration of blockchain entries requires a massive peer-to-peer network in order to resist distortion or manipulation.\n\nAnyone at all is free to join the blockchain network, as a holder and spender of currency, and/or as a node contributing to the consensus process. The incentive to participate comes in the form of a random reward paid whenever the ledger is settled, which is roughly every 10 minutes. The odds of a node winning the reward go up with the amount of computing power it adds to the network, and so running a node is dubbed bitcoin ""mining"".\n\nThe only authoritative record of anyone\'s bitcoin balance is held on the blockchain. Account holders operate a wallet application, which shows their balance and lets them spend it, moving bitcoin to other accounts. Counter-intuitively, these ""wallets"" hold no money; all they do is control account holders\' private keys, and provide a user interface to what\'s in the blockchain.\n\nIn fact bitcoin is entirely ethereal, with not even virtual coins. The Blockchain only records the movement of bitcoin in and out of account holders\' wallets, and calculates virtual balances as the difference between what\'s been spent and what\'s been paid.\n\nThe only way to spend your balance is to use your private key, to digitally sign an instruction to the network, specifying the amount to move, and the address (that is, the public key) of where to move it to. If a private key is lost or destroyed, then the balance associated with that key is frozen forever and can never be spent. Ever.\n\nThere has been a string of notorious mishaps where computers or disk drives holding bitcoin wallets have been lost, together with millions of dollars of value they controlled. And predictably, numerous pieces of malicious software have been developed specifically to steal bitcoin private keys and balances.\n\nThe enthusiasm for crypto-currency innovation has proven infectious; the feeling is that if blockchain ""squared the circle"" in payments, then it must have untold powers in other domains.\n\nIn particular, many commentators have promoted blockchain for identity management.\n\nThe conspicuous thing about proposals to put ""identity on the blockchain"" is that they overwhelmingly come from blockchain advocates and not identity management experts. What\'s missing in the great majority of blockchain-for-identity proposals – and indeed in most of the non-payments use cases – is a careful statement of the problem and proper analysis of why distributed consensus is important.\n\nWhat the blockchain can\'t do\n\nSadly, when you look closely, the blockchain just doesn\'t do what most people seem to think it does. There is nothing ""on"" the blockchain. All it holds is a record of bitcoin movements and associated metadata. The metaphor of recording anything ""on"" it belies the need for additional technologies and processes over and above blockchain, to decide how to represent physical items in code and to oversee the assignment of those codes. These necessitate extra key management, registration of ownership, and governance.\n\nBlockchain does nothing about these realities, neither does any other distributed ledger technology that has followed in bitcoin\'s wake. Blockchain was expressly designed to manage crypto-currency without any key management or registration. No one is trusted in the naked bitcoin world. No administrator and no third party is needed to vouch for any wallet holder or network node. The lack of friction is great for the unbanked (as well as illicit users) and it also helps build the peer-to-peer network, which must be maintained at a huge scale in order to guard against those untrusted participants conspiring against the system.\n\nAnd it\'s best to remember that the incentive to run blockchain nodes comes from the mining reward. Take bitcoin away from non-payment use cases and it\'s unclear who will pay for the infrastructure, and how. The original blockchain is not separable from bitcoin. Now, there is certainly plenty of fresh research and development being done on alternative consensus mechanisms and participation models. But nothing yet is up and running like the established public blockchain, and nothing else has yet been proven with blockchain\'s security properties.\n\nBlockchain does just one thing: it establishes the order of entries in a distributed ledger, so as to prevent double spend without an umpire. The truth of the contents of the ledger is an entirely different matter. Blockchain doesn\'t magically make the entries themselves trustworthy, let alone the people that created them.\n\nDespite the hype, blockchain is not a ""trust protocol""; it\'s actually the opposite. Just think about it: it\'s not as though paying by bitcoin stops you from being ripped off. For anything of value other than bitcoin to be transacted via the blockchain requires additional layers of agents, third parties and auditors – things that just don\'t square with the trust-free architecture.\n\nLofty claims are made for blockchain\'s ability to decentralise all sorts of things. But in truth, blockchain only decentralises the adjudication of the order of entries in a ledger. It is not a general or native ""Internet of Value"" as claimed by authors like Don and Alex Tapscott. It was expressly designed for electronic cash; it has no native connection to real world assets.\n\nFew businesses have escaped the call to evaluate blockchain technologies. If you\'ve been persuaded to have a look, then as a first step, re-examine your security and record keeping needs. Take the time to understand what blockchain does, and all the things it leaves to be done by other systems. If your business is decentralised and your assets are purely digital, then blockchain has a lot to offer, but otherwise, it\'s just another database.\n\nExplore further: Goldman Sachs seeks patent on virtual currency', 'Panamanian crypto-teller machine TigoCTM has added Dash to its roster of cryptocurrencies for sale and purchase over its network in Latin America.\n\nWith a new partnership, Dash will see its partner TigoCTM, a crypto teller machine company, add the cryptocurrency to its network of ATMs that already provides bitcoin and other digital currencies to adopters and new users in Panama and Latin America.\n\nTigoCTM CEO Cindy Zimmerman sees reason for cryptocurrencies to flourish in Latin America among unbanked or underbanked users in Latin America, particularly in countries like Venezuela where economic instability and uncertainty is well publicized. The chief executive revealed that many of TigoCTM’s customers do not trust nor want to use the banking system locally.\n\nIn statements, Zimmerman said:\n\nWe started this company in Panama because there was no way for anyone there to convert cash into cryptocurrency, and after the financial crisis in Venezuela took hold, the demand for an alternative way of accessing money quickly grew. For example, the bolivar has recently seen 100% year over year inflation; bitcoin has been more stable than some local fiat currencies.\n\nDash turned two years old in January 2016 and marked the occasion by doubling its blocksize from 1MB to 2MB following an instant vote among stakeholders running a node of 1,000 Dash or more. The voting process was resolved within 24 hours, with an overwhelming majority of 2156 yes votes to 4 who voted against the blocksize increase.\n\nDash founder Evan Duffield spoke to CCN after the second year of the Dash project, which he saw as a fork of Bitcoin, before detailing fundamental differences between Dash and Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is notable for its use of a two-tier network of masternodes, unlike the Bitcoin network where all nodes are seen as the same.\n\nSpeaking to CCN, Duffield stated:\n\n[T]he Dash network with its second tier gives the network the ability to pay our full-nodes, allowing for a permanent robust network of nodes. As our network grows, the operators of our second tier actually make more money because they share in the mining reward. Built on this technology, we’ve unlocked the ability to do instantaneous transactions on our network that confirm in 1-4 seconds.\n\nWith a market cap of $55 million, Dash is currently the 8th biggest cryptocurrency, with a trading volume of $ 338,978 in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Blockchain is a way to rapidly exchange digital assets — such as payments, photos and contracts — between two or more parties in a secure, verifiable and auditable process that doesn’t require a middleman. Each party in the network has its own copy of the blockchain attached to every asset. As long as the chains are in sync, all parties can be confident that the asset or transaction is valid.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain?\n\nIf you’re familiar with peer-to-peer file-sharing network like BitTorrent, or if you synchronize files between multiple computers using a service like Dropbox, you have a basic understanding of how the network works. With BitTorrent, each computer shares files with others on the network. Files are constantly kept in sync so that everyone has the same copy. Updated copies are replicated to everyone who has a copy of that file.\n\nBlockchain adds a persistent code and security layer to the process. The code — or block — is unique to that asset and stays with it forever. Blocks are time-stamped and protected with encryption that is considered unbreakable. The blockchain record on each computer in the network is called a ledger.\n\nEach time the asset is modified, a new block is added, creating a chain (hence the term). All parties in the network receive a copy of the updated asset with the new blockchain. As long as the blockchains match, there can be no question about authenticity; if any blockchain doesn’t match the others, the asset is considered invalid and the update is rejected. Updates happen very quickly, usually in milliseconds.\n\nBeyond Bitcoin\n\nBlockchain is most commonly associated with bitcoin, a digital currency that can be exchanged without the need for banks, clearinghouses or other intermediaries. Bitcoin transactions are instantaneous and are considered highly secure.\n\nHowever, blockchain can be used in many other ways. For example, a professional photographer could add a blockchain to verify the authenticity of copyrighted photos. Copies of the photos that lack the verified blockchain could then be pegged as fraudulent. The same goes for titles, deeds, contracts and any other documents that need to be exchanged between multiple parties in a trust network.\n\nBlockchains can also be used to create digital records of use and payments to content creators. The technology can expedite transactions and ensure that all parties have a right to use the copyrighted material.\n\nBlockchains can be public or private, with the rules set by the parties involved. Private blockchains may have lower levels of security if the parties already trust each other; bitcoin is a highly secure network precisely because anyone can use it.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nFor industries whose processes can frequently be delayed due to the need for third-party verification, such as banking, blockchain reduces costs and speeds up the settlement of transactions. Instead of waiting days for a check to clear, a payment can be verified in seconds. There’s also less risk that payments will have to be denied because funds are unavailable. There’s no more “playing the float” since account debits and credits are instantaneous.\n\nBy removing the need for a middleman, blockchain also enhances security. The more parties involved in a transaction, the greater the risk that one could be compromised. But in a blockchain network, transactions happen directly between parties, so there’s less chance of failure at one of the handoff points.\n\nCorporate record keeping could also be dramatically simplified, with the need for validation mechanisms like notaries and third-party signatories reduced. Corporations that produce assets in digital form could track their use with greater precision and generate royalty and licensing revenues that might otherwise be lost.\n\nTrends to Watch\n\nBanks are banding together to compensate for one of blockchain’s weaknesses: transparency that makes it vulnerable to third-party snoops. A consortium of 53 banks is currently working to improve privacy in blockchain transactions.\n\nThe Linux Foundation has announced a major new initiative called Hyperledger, which will build blockchains with a series of standard protocols and processes that could be used by a wide variety of industries. With this and other advancements, blockchain may be the salve for managing and securing patient records in the health care industry.\n\nIf you want to learn more about blockchain, IBM has a host of software, training resources and community support.

07/21/2016,"['The first federal securities fraud case involving a bitcoin investment scheme has ended with perpetrator Trendon Shavers receiving a sentence of 18 months in prison.\n\nIn addition, Shavers was assessed penalties including three years of supervised release, a $100 special assessment, $1.2m in forfeiture and $1.2m in restitution.\n\nThe decision puts to rest a case that began in July 2013 when Shavers was charged with defrauding investors through an investment service called Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BCS&T), which was later deemed to be a fraudulent ponzi scheme.\n\nShavers, who was charged with one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud, faced up to 40 years in prison. He pled not guilty to fraud charges in March 2015, a decision he would later reverse in September of that year as part of a plea deal that lowered his possible sentence to a maximum of 41 months.\n\nIn statements, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said the case was an example of how new technology can be used to perpetrate activities that are already illegal under existing law.\n\nBharara said:\n\n""Applying a modern spin to an age-old fraud, Trendon Shavers used a bitcoin business to run a classic Ponzi scheme. Shavers raised money in the form of bitcoins by promising spectacular returns and personal guarantees, when all he was really doing was paying back old investors with new investors’ bitcoins.""\n\nAccording to Reuters, Shavers was apologetic in court, stating that he ""royally messed up"".\n\n""I don\'t think this is something I\'m ever going to get over,"" he said, according to the report.\n\nShavers was fined $40.7m in a related civil lawsuit in September of 2014. He was later arrested in November of that year. Prosecutors now project 48 of the scheme\'s approximately 100 investors lost all or part of investments.\n\nNew York prosecutors report Shavers fraudulently obtained approximately 146,000 BTC as a result of the scheme, a figure worth $807,380 based on the average price of bitcoin during the scheme and worth $97m at press time.\n\nGavel image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The thief has managed to steal everything that belonged to you and a good deal of others—$56 million worth of a new virtual currency that you\'ve invested in, to be exact. You have a month to decide what to do.\n\nThis might seem like an impossible situation, the kind of pressure cooker that breeds hasty decisions, but it\'s exactly the dilemma that faced the developers and users of a new cryptocurrency and coding platform called Ethereum.\n\nIn June, millions of dollars were stolen from a crowd-directed investment fund called the DAO and siphoned into a smaller version referred to as a ""child DAO."" The only way to get it back was with a hard fork that slipped a refund mechanism into the DAO and all its offshoots. This meant a change to Ethereum\'s code that split the currency into two versions, which users had to choose between by either updating their software or not. It was a risky proposal that threatened to permanently cleave Ethereum, and it had its share of vocal dissenters who saw the change as manipulating the system to ""bail out"" the DAO.\n\nMere hours after the fork began, however, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin called it: the fork was a success, with 85 percent of users moving over to the new version.\n\nUsers of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that inspired large portions of how Ethereum works, were watching the fork closely and tweeting with a heady mix of respect for the Ethereum community and perhaps just a bit of jealousy. You see, Bitcoin has been gripped with indecision amid a year-long debate over whether or not to fork the currency\'s software just like Ethereum did.\n\n""When there\'s cash on the line even the most all-encompassing nerd becomes deeply conservative""\n\nHow did Ethereum manage to do in a month what Bitcoin seems utterly incapable of even coming close to pulling off?\n\nThe main factors may be Ethereum\'s relatively small community compared to Bitcoin, making it easier to come to a consensus, and how hard forks are built into the platform in a way that Bitcoin has never seen.\n\n""Politics are very much a part of Ethereum, just like with Bitcoin, but I think Bitcoin is just basically rotten with politics,"" said Stephan Tual, the French developer who designed the DAO alongside German brothers Simon and Christoph Jentzsch.\n\n""The reason they can\'t coordinate,"" he added, ""is because they hate each other.""\n\nWhile hate may be a strong word, the debate about whether to hard fork Bitcoin\'s software has reached critical levels of acrimony and ideological rhetoric about the virtues of decentralization. The furor led core developer Mike Hearn to slam the door on Bitcoin and brand the whole experiment a failure.\n\nThe bitcoin ecosystem is also extremely varied and everybody is trying to protect their interests without blowing the whole thing up, from the miners who make thousands of dollars for every block of bitcoin data they compute to the services that allow people to send money overseas or buy groceries with bitcoin. The system is entrenched, and changing anything at all elicits fears of a shake-up.\n\n""A hard fork for Bitcoin would be like travelling on a train going 200 miles per hour going over a bridge,"" Tual said. ""Someone says, to make it go faster we\'re going to send a bunch of nerds to go change the engine at the front. Who would volunteer?""\n\n""Bitcoin will never evolve, and it will die, because what doesn\'t evolve dies""\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum is still a very young platform with only a few thousand users and one killer app: the DAO. Forking the system to save the one thing that Ethereum really had going for it, and that many people had invested in, was a no-brainer for most and easy to agree upon. In contrast, changes to Bitcoin are likely to advantage one group while having potentially dire economic consequences for many others.\n\n""For Bitcoin, the community is essentially riven and I\'m surprised any changes get through at all,"" John Biggs, founder of Freemit, a Bitcoin service to send money abroad. ""The ultimate problem is that you have to gain consensus and when there\'s cash on the line even the most all-encompassing nerd becomes deeply conservative.""\n\nVitalik Buterin, the inventor of Ethereum, agreed that the largest difference between bitcoin and Ethereum when it comes to forking is ""the differences between the two protocols\' communities.""\n\nHowever, he also suggested after the hard fork on Wednesday that if Ethereum ever needs to fork again in order to solve a major problem, it may not be so easy. ""Forks will only get more and more difficult to implement over time as the community grows,"" he wrote Motherboard in an email at the time.\n\nThe second reason for Ethereum\'s apparent ease in pulling off a hard fork compared to bitcoin, Tual said, is that hard forks are par for the course at this nascent stage of the platform\'s development.\n\nThe hard fork to refund the DAO\'s money was actually Ethereum\'s third—there\'s been one every time the software has been upgraded to a more powerful version—and there is even one on the horizon, since Ethereum is getting set to upgrade to a version called Metropolis.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin has only ever experienced one event that could be described as a hard fork, and it was basically an accident that occurred not because of a planned software upgrade, but a faulty block of bitcoin data.\n\nEthereum is still a big experiment that can afford to have a few eggs broken at the moment, Tual said. ""We haven\'t seen what Ethereum can do yet and it\'s just in alpha,"" he said.\n\nThe deadlock between competing corners of the Bitcoin community when it comes to hard forking, in contrast, spells doom for the currency, according to Tual. ""As long as that\'s true, Bitcoin will never evolve, and it will die, because what doesn\'t evolve dies.""\n\nAccording to Biggs, Bitcoin\'s failure to evolve thanks to an inability to agree on a way forward means that centralized organizations—say, banks or credit payment processing companies—will be the ones to benefit from the technology simply because they\'re able to move faster when it comes to changing the system.\n\n""I\'m betting that true decentralized cryptocurrencies will eventually become a sideshow in a corporate blockchain circus,"" Biggs said.\n\nFor Ethereum, riding on the high of a successful fork, a similar fate might seem like a distant possibility right now—but proponents of the platform would do well to heed Buterin\'s warning and wonder: for how long?\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that Stephan Tual is German and designed the DAO with his two brothers. In fact, Tual is French and designed the DAO with two German brothers, to whom he is not related.\n\n', 'The following post reflects the opinion of the author and is not to be seen as any investment advice. Whenever investing in Bitcoin (or anything else) you are putting your money at risk and should do this at your own risk. In short, THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADICE!\n\nOver the past several months bitcoin prices have increased substantially, rising from less than $250 last fall to over $650 in July. For people who have been investing in bitcoin, this should come as no surprise. After all, the currency was designed from the basic code on up to gain value over the years. Still, the dramatic climb over the last few months is definitely something worth digging into, and for newer investors, understanding this price increase is essential.\n\nSo why are bitcoin prices so high? As a currency, bitcoin can be impacted by a large number of events and issues, so there is no single answer. We will, however, explore some of the biggest factors in bitcoin’s recent climb, and also consider some events and scenarios that could push bitcoin prices up even further in the future.\n\nIt’s All About Supply and Demand\n\nSupply and demand are the two most fundamental concepts in modern economics, and they have a dramatic impact on one another. If demand outstrips supply, then prices tend to rise. However, if supply is greater than demand, prices tend to drop. This is true in every deregulated market, and is essential for understanding the increase in Bitcoin’s price. The higher the demand for bitcoin, the higher prices will be.\n\nAs for supply, Bitcoin’s supply is relegated by the currency itself. Bitcoin founder Natoshi Nakamoto stipulated that the maximum supply of bitcoin be set at 21 million. Meaning once 21 million bitcoins are mined, no more new coins will ever enter circulation. This is in stark contrast to most national currencies. Governments generally increase the money supply every year, which is one of the key reasons for inflation and the gradual devaluation of currencies.\n\nWhat’s more, the number of bitcoins created after each mined block is gradually decreasing. Approximately every four years, the number of bitcoins rewarded for mining a block is cut in half. On July 9th, 2016, the supply of new bitcoins was cut from 25 to 12.5. This reduction in new coins helps to bolster bitcoin’s exchange rate, and helps explains why bitcoin has increased so much over the last few months, though other events have also had an impact.\n\nSo Why Do Bitcoin Prices Vary From Market to Market?\n\nDifferent bitcoin exchanges often display different prices for bitcoins. Prices generally stabilize over the long hall, but at times prices can vary wildly from market to market. Part of this is due to that fact that there is no central marketplace, and thus supply and demand can vary from market to market. If the majority of bitcoin investors are bullish (i.e. wanting to buy) in one exchange, prices will likely trend upwards. Likewise, if bitcoin investors are bearish (i.e. wanting to sell) in another market, they will probably trend downwards. Both events can happen at the same time, with prices pressures differing from market to market.\n\nOther factors, such as fees, the perceived legitimacy and stability of the exchanges themselves, and low volumes, among other things, can all impact prices in individual exchanges. When you are trading bitcoin, don’t always jump at the cheapest coins, but also consider the exchanges themselves. For example, before Mt.Gox collapsed Bitcoins were sold for more than 50% less of the regular market price. The reason is because people didn’t believe that they will be able to withdraw their money from that exchange so they went on a selling spree.\n\nFurther, supply and demand can be heavily impacted by local conditions. If an exchange is based in Europe, and caters mostly to European investors, and a big local event dramatically changes supply and demand, prices might change rapidly in the European market, even if they stay stable in other markets (e.g. the recent Brexit caused Bitcoin’s price to trend up).\n\nSo What Events Can Impact Bitcoin?\n\nThere are many events that can impact the price and value of bitcoins. We can’t go over all of them, not in one article, but we can highlight some of the biggest, most common, and most important events. As we go through some examples, remember that it all largely boils down to supply and demand. In other words, the events are having an impact on supply and demand itself.\n\nFirst, it’s important to understand that bitcoin has taken on the role of a “safe haven” investment vehicle. Certain investments, such as bitcoin and gold, become favored when markets are turbulent. This is because investors are looking for safe havens because other investments, like stocks and options, simply appear to be too high risk to invest in.\n\nRight now, the global economy looks quite dangerous. China is dealing with bad loans and a potential asset bubble, among other things. The European Union and the United Kingdom are still dealing with the fallout from the Brexit vote. Spain, Italy, and Greece, among others, are struggling with poor public finances, high unemployment, and other serious challenges. With stock markets looking so turbulent, safe havens like bitcoin look very attractive.\n\nSo why is bitcoin a safe haven? One of the primary reasons bitcoin is viewed as a safe haven is because of its limited supply. When national economies are struggling, governments tend to print up new money, which reduces the value of individual dollars, pounds, etc. This means that even cash itself is not a safe investment during a downturn.\n\nOther events can also impact bitcoin. For example, a major company might announce that they will start accepting bitcoin, or national regulators could announce new regulations. Add in scandals, like when the Mt. Gox Exchange collapsed, and you’ll quickly see that there are many events that bitcoin investors must watch out for.\n\nPredicting the Rise and Fall in Bitcoin Prices\n\nFirst, there is no magic formula or way to predict the rise and fall in bitcoin prices with 100 percent accuracy. That being said, we can offer some information to get you started. Remember, however, that the biggest factor is supply and demand.\n\nThere are two types of bitcoin investors, fundamental investors, who use a mix of quantitative and qualitative data to invest in bitcoin, usually for long period of time, and technical investors who focus almost exclusively on quantitative data, and generally only invest with the intent to hold bitcoins for only a few days, hours, or even minutes.\n\nWith fundamental investing, you will generally adopt a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. You’ll keep an eye on charts and numbers, sure, but you’ll also spend a lot of time reading the news, and watching for major events. If an economic crisis breaks out in the United States, for example, and stock markets sink, you might try to invest in bitcoins before other investors start buying them up in search of a safe haven.\n\nWith quantitative analysis, you attempt to uncover discrepancies in prices. For example, bitcoin might suddenly and unexplainably drop by 5 percent. Having watched bitcoin for a long period of time, you recognize that when these sudden unexplainable drops happen, prices tend to rebound quickly, so you decide to invest in bitcoin.\n\nUsing technical analysis usually requires the use of advanced technical analysis tools that allow you to analyze markets quickly, and often automatically. Before investing large sums via technical analysis, it’s recommended that you spend some time learning more about this investment strategy.\n\nSo Will Bitcoin Prices Continue To Rise?\n\nThe limited total-supply and tapering of new bitcoins means that bitcoin prices will probably continue to rise, over the long run. Right now, bitcoin prices might be in a slight bubble, with bitcoin investors reacting to global economic turbulence, and with the new supply of coins having recently been halved. Even if bitcoin prices drop a bit (something called a correction), over the long run bitcoin prices will likely continue to rise. In fact, if prices do drop, it’ll probably be a great time to invest.\n\nShould another recession hit, or a major financial crisis break out, bitcoin prices could rise dramatically. Even if not, bitcoin will (likely) continue to gain value in the months and years ahead. That doesn’t mean that prices won’t drop, markets tend to ebb and flow, but bitcoins will remain among the safer investments out there.\n\nThe following post reflects the opinion of the author and is not to be seen as any investment advice. Whenever investing in Bitcoin (or anything else) you are putting your money at risk and should do this at your own risk. In short, THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADICE!', ""Today’s modern economy depends upon a mindboggling array of servers spread across the planet – mining and retrieving data to create value for humanity. Indeed, much of our modern economy is digital. By its very nature, this modern, digital economy is fueled by affordable electricity. In this modern economy, a new form of currency has emerged called cryptocurrency. Based on encryption (encoding) there are literally dozens of these digital currencies, the most famous and popular of these being Bitcoin. Bitcoin – and the energy use required in its creation - is the currency we will focus on in this post.\n\nWhile the currency itself is ethereal, Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies are anchored in the real world, and they have a voracious and growing appetite for electricity. Hundreds of megawatts of power are used in the global production of Bitcoin today. Nobody knows quite how much, since many of the bitcoin ‘miners’ maintain a very low profile and they are spread across the planet. Bitcoin mining operations – essentially massive and powerful datacenters - are located internationally, and usually concentrated where the cost of electricity is cheapest. That’s because the cost of electricity can make up 90-95% of total ongoing mining costs. These datacenter mines can be found in numerous countries, from the Republic of Georgia to Iceland, to Malaysia and Venezuela. The largest share of the miners are located in China, close to the border with Tibet where cheap hydropower is relatively abundant.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin? – Bitcoin is digital money (estimated recently by Reuters to be worth approximately $10 billion globally) that can be used to buy and sell anything, and can be transacted online. A growing number of individuals and companies are using it, including Expedia and Overstock.com. There’s no Fed here, printing money, manipulating interest rates, or managing Quantitative Easing. The currency is created through a process called 'mining,' in which the solving of math problems is rewarded with new bitcoins. Energy and computers are like the fuel and the bulldozers, clawing away at a proverbial hillside for gold. These very powerful computers armed with specialized chips are meant to do just one thing: solve math problems using open source software.\n\nIf you are new to the concept, it’s a lot to wrap one’s head around, and it has some aspects that make it feel like a real-life video game. It’s also somewhat complex: the notion that one can create currency by virtue of solving complex math problems that seal off blocks of transactions in a decentralized and publicly visible blockchain general ledger. In the global race to solve the next problem, if your solution wins, you get awarded bitcoins.\n\nThe Bitcoin network stores every transaction that ever occurred in a giant decentralized network called a blockchain. Each miner has a unique ID/address, or multiple IDs, but nobody knows who the individuals are. The ID is kind of like a Social Security number. Every computer involved in mining bitcoin is networked and works jointly with all the others around the globe. If part of the network goes down, the entire system can partition that piece off and continue to function. Still don’t get it? Perhaps an example or two will help.\n\nHow One Buys or Sells in the Blockchain – To buy or sell using bitcoins in the blockchain, you first need a wallet (a kind of electronic bank account) on your computer or cellphone, and that wallet will generate a unique bitcoin address, that should be used only once. Once you have a wallet you are ready to transact, buying or selling something with bitcoin that you bought for dollars, Euros, or some other currency (unless you created bitcoins yourself by mining). Bitcoins are not cheap. On July 19th, one bitcoin was worth roughly $675, though the value fluctuates constantly just like any other currency. So when person A buys something from person B, the transaction is recorded in the blockchain – a public ledger in a global cloud of networked computers. Each bitcoin wallet has a unique and private key (known as a ‘seed’) that is used to authenticate the transaction, prove it came from that specific wallet, and keep the record from being altered after the fact. Multiple transactions are occurring constantly (between 150,000 and 250,000 transactions occur daily), and everybody can see that they occurred – they just don’t know the identity of the participants. And then the cool bitcoin mining part: every 10 minutes, the transactions are irrevocably locked up. They are swept chronologically into a single block of the block chain that is sealed through the Bitcoin mining process.\n\nThe Process of 'Mining' – Mining is where the currency is created. It’s the process of confirming the blockchain transactions that occurred in the last ten minutes, sweeping them into a list and creating the most recent block that is waiting to be secured. It’s based on consensus and it keeps the block chain intact and inviolable. To all intents and purposes, bitcoin is ‘discovered’ by computers that compete globally with one another to gain credit for sealing off the latest block in the chain.\n\nWith the creation of each new block, miners create what is called a ‘hash,’ which takes the information in the most recent block and turns it into a unique sequence of letters and numbers. Each new hash takes its place at the end of the block. One of the inputs to the latest hash is the hash from the previous block. So if somebody came in and tried to tamper with a block already installed in the ever-lengthening chain, that hash would change, as would all the subsequent downstream hashes, and alert everybody in the network that something was amiss. Every time a new hash is created, the miner gets bitcoins. Once 210,000 blocks are created, the value of the award is cut by 50% (one of these reductions just occurred in July, reducing the award level from 25 to 12.5 bitcoins)."", 'Bitcoin miners in Chelan County, Washington will now have to shell out more for the electricity following Public Utility District‘s decision to increase energy tariff from next year.\n\nThe increased energy rates are not just applicable to Bitcoin mining centers but to other energy intensive operations including regular data centers and server farms. According to reports, the public discussion and negotiations regarding the new electricity rates extended for over 18 months before reaching this point. Bitcoin business owners in the region took part in these negotiations as any increase in the energy costs may significantly affect their profitability. The effects will be further compounded by the recent halving of Bitcoin rewards and stagnant Bitcoin price.\n\nBitcoin mining farms are classified as High-Density Load consumers under the ‘Schedule 35‘ provided they consume over 250-kilowatt hours of electricity per square foot of operational floor space in a year, with the requirement not exceeding 5 megawatts at any point in time.\n\nHowever, reports suggest that none of the representatives of the Bitcoin mining operations in the region were present during the voting process. The results of the voting are said to be unanimous in the favor of new increased tariff which will come into effect on January 1, 2017.\n\nStarting next year, High-Density Load operators will have to pay a monthly charge ranging from $130 to $860 per meter along with additional $5.50 per kilowatt and $0.027 per kilowatt hour as monthly demand charges and energy charges respectively. They will also have to make an upfront payment to cover all the costs incurred by the department to distribute power to the facilities.\n\nAccording to the Public Utility District commissioners, the new rates were introduced after they noticed a sudden surge in demand for electricity. Upon study, it was discovered that the surge was driven by increased Bitcoin mining activity in the county, which was otherwise known for cheaper energy prices compared to other places in the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, MGT Capital Investments Inc. (NYSEMKT:MGT), a company owned by John McAfee announced its plans to launch a new 2 PetaHash capacity mining operation in Washington State, expected to be operational next month. It is not clear whether recent developments will affect the plans or not.\n\nRef: GovTech | Image: MiningLifeOnline', 'Smaller, poorer countries are being abandoned by big banks in an exodus commonly referred to as “de-risking” or “de-banking.” In the Caribbean, where many small countries with poorer populations reside close to each other, the problem is getting so bad that local businesses regularly have a hard time receiving remittances and paying suppliers outside of their own country, even when their trading partner is just the next island over.\n\nThe growing trend in the Caribbean is the topic of a recent report by the IMF, and the subject of a talk by IMF director Christine Lagarde on Monday, at the US Federal Reserve.\n\n- Madame Lagarde, Director IMF\n\n\n\nAccording to Madame Lagarde, at least five Caribbean countries were ‘de-risked’ as of this May, with 16 or more international banks withdrawing their correspondent banking relationships.\n\nThis land-locks the money on some of these island nations, cutting residents and businesses off from foreign trade. Belize is most affected by the trend, but most of the Caribbean is deeply affected.\n\nCompounding the problem is that these smaller, poorer countries depend on international trade the most.\n\nMadame Lagarde mentioned that such countries are “especially vulnerable,” with citizens in them often depending on remittances from family members who work abroad.\n\nThese citizens already had minimal access to financial services under the best of circumstances, now they are completely cut off in some areas.\n\nThe poorer a country is, the more likely that banks will leave due to low profits. The more banks that leave, the less trade that can be done there, and the poorer the country becomes.\n\nIt’s a vicious cycle that, so the theory goes, can spread like cancer from neighbor to neighbor in regions like the Caribbean.\n\n- Madame Lagarde\n\nThe IMF director used her speech to call on regulators in financial centers, both large and small, to do more to help banks maintain these relationships. It’s a hard sell, however, since the banks waited until their relationships were unprofitable. Spending money fighting regulations may be less expensive than retaining banking relationships in the region.\n\nWhile many solutions are being talked about, the problem in the Caribbean has grown so desperate that it is clear to everyone involved that something major has to change. Few people know the problem as well as Gabriel Abed, CEO and co-founder of Bitt, the Caribbean’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume.\n\nBraveNewCoin talked with Abed about the IMF assessment, and the CEO happily reported that bitcoin has “cracked out of the embryonic phase and [bitcoin professionals] are beginning to see the bitcoin movement grow legs across the region.”\n\n- Gabriel Abed, Bitt CEO & Co-Founder\n\nHis view of the problem mirrors that of the IMF. However, it’s more nuanced, according to Abed. It’s more to do with perception and relationships, rather than profits alone: “What the Caribbean is really suffering from is a misperception associated with the ‘offshore’ industry, and a lack of economic and political clout.”\n\nBitt was the recipient of a $16 million investment last April, from Overstock.com’s CEO Patrick Byrne, in what turned out to be a local media circus. Bitt then started offering a central-bank-backed digitized version of the Barbadian Dollar inside of their bitcoin wallet. The company is now on a mission to ease the trade problems that Madame Lagarde has outlined, and plans to do the same for other currencies in the region.\n\nOverstock’s Byrne made his investment in Bitt because the startup has been developing a suite of blockchain solutions for central banks to manage issuance of digital currency and monetary policy. Abed says that his team has been “adding a ton of new features to our existing software,” and for us to “Expect to see Bitt deploy a new set of novel blockchain financial tools and products by December 2016.”\n\nWithout launching an ad campaign, “Bitt has experienced a 33% increase in users each month since February,” primarily from organic search engine traffic. The CEO says that his company has “seen people, on their own, searching online for bitcoin solutions and landing on our homepage.”\n\nGauging customer awareness of the region’s banking problems is problematic, “but the banks are devoting significant attention to the so-called ‘de-risking problem’.” Abed learned of the problems by attending regional banking industry association meetings, “where de-risking was the focus of conversation.”\n\n- Abed\n\n“When you combine a dearth of financial services with heavy dependence on transfers of wealth from abroad,” he concluded, “you end up with an exploitative system that bitcoin and blockchain technology are primed to disrupt.”\n\nCheerfully up for the challenge, Abed told BraveNewCoin that his company will be able to, “Unequivocally,” handle all of the shortfalls from lost bank business.\n\n“The more foreign exchange Bitt brings into the region’s financial ecosystem,” he explained, “the more excited central banks, governments, and regional bankers become, and the more the Caribbean grows into a bitcoin and blockchain hub.”', '', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'A long-running effort to move data for bitcoin\'s transaction blocks around the world more efficiently has received an upgrade.\n\nSince bitcoin was released, an array of services or solutions have emerged to meet the needs of those using the digital currency. These include exchanges that allow bitcoin to be bought and sold for government-issued currencies; mining pools, which grew as miners sought to collectivize for greater profit; and new kinds of wallets that delivered better functionality and security.\n\nBut, some of the needs of the distributed network are not readily apparent to observers.\n\nAs Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell puts it, the Bitcoin Relay Network, the brainchild of fellow Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo, arose several years ago in response to a need to propagate bitcoin block data more quickly among miners, or those who process its transactions.\n\n""A couple years ago as blocks started getting above 250k regularly we saw what looked like a rapid consolidation of miners towards the most popular pools. One of the reasons was smaller pools were experiencing high orphaning,"" Maxwell recalls.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""It seemed like we were rapidly on a trend where only a single pool would exist.""\n\nHowever, he said Corallo sprung into action, developing the original relay network and delivering what Maxwell called ""radically improved block propagation speed"".\n\nThe Bitcoin Relay Network ultimately materialized as a network of nodes positioned in China, Europe, North America, Russia and Southeast Asia. Each of the nodes sports a robust internet connection, and in theory acts as a railroad for block data. The data is compressed and then transmitted via the Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP.\n\nThat system has been described as bitcoin\'s vascular or nervous system – a critical component to delivering information throughout the body. Now, an enhanced successor has been released.\n\nEnter FIBRE\n\nCorallo recently unveiled the Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine (FIBRE), an effort aimed at building a more capable version to the Bitcoin Relay Network.\n\nThe idea is that, by improving the speed at which this information is conveyed, miners can reduce the amount of orphan blocks, or transaction blocks that are rejected by the network in favor of another created around that time.\n\nCorallo, who operated the original network and designed the new version, said that the initiative also helped increase the cost of selfish mining and cut down on the amount of empty blocks generated through SPV mining.\n\nBut according to Corallo, the existing relay network began to ""show its age"" in the last year, prompting work on the new software in the past several months.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Over the past few years of running it and very carefully benchmarking it, I\'ve found that you just can\'t get the kind of reliable low-latency relay you want when using TCP in any form. A few months ago I finally got around to starting from scratch to build a new fast-relay protocol, building Compact Blocks as the foundation and early versions of FIBRE at the same time.""\n\nAt issue, Corallo explained, was that the network that functioned via TCP was susceptible to data loss, which would require additional processing (and thus increasing the time it takes to relay blocks). He explained in his blog post introducing FIBRE that, with TCP, data packets can get lost along the way.\n\n""Only then will the sender retransmit the lost packets, allowing the receiver to (potentially) reconstruct the original transmission,"" he wrote.\n\nThese extra round-trip times ultimately caused spikes in relay time on the original Relay Network, he explained.\n\nFIBRE\'s upgrade\n\nTo sidestep this problem of latency – the time in which it takes packets of data from one point to another (in this case, from node to node), Corallo said he turned to another protocol, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).\n\n""Instead of using TCP to send the data required to transmit a block once and relying on full round-trips to detect and resend lost packets, FIBRE sends the data using UDP with additional Forward Error Correction (FEC) data (ie data which allows you to reconstruct the full transmitted data even though some was lost),"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nIt’s this latter element, FEC, that Maxwell referred to as ""a bit of technology magic"".\n\nFIBRE\'s makeup also involves BIP 152, a proposal for ""compact blocks"" aimed at cutting down the amount of bandwidth used when block data moves from node to node.\n\n""This way, even if some parts are lost, the block is still received very quickly and without back and forth communication,"" Maxwell explained. ""It also retains its speed even if the block doesn\'t look very much like the receivers mempool.""\n\nNetwork effects\n\nYet for all the enhancements, FIBRE’s most ambitious aim is, perhaps, an effort to get people around the world to run more networks.\n\nOriginally, the network was maintained under the auspices of Corallo himself, meaning that its operation – as with any bitcoin node – was contingent on his ability to maintain it.\n\nDespite its code being freely available, Corallo said that there wasn’t much of an appetite to stand up additional networks. Ultimately, the success of a network (or system of networks) is arguably dependent on getting more people to actually run them.\n\nFIBRE seeks to change this dynamic. The software is designed to function as an add-on to Bitcoin Core, offering an avenue for more people to come into contact with the code and potentially launch their own relay networks.\n\nAccording to Corallo, work is underway to encourage other parties to create their own FIBRE-based relay networks – an effort he said is needed to keep things decentralized.\n\nCorallo has also published a guide for setting up FIBRE networks.\n\nIn the meantime, he said new groups are now interested in setting up relay systems, and he is, for now, cautiously optimistic more users will help the cause.\n\nHe continued:\n\n""I\'m not sure if I should mention them by name yet, but I\'m confident at least two or so will stand something up and make it publicly available soonish.""\n\nProcessing chip via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""For the ECB it is important to keep its options open.""\n\nThe bank will announce its rate decision at 1145 GMT and Draghi will hold a news conference at 1230 GMT.\n\nThe euro <EUR=> was up slightly against the U.S. dollar while futures on German government debt eased slightly.\n\nThe ECB is buying 1.74 trillion euros ($1.91 trillion) worth of assets to cut borrowing costs, induce spending, lift growth and ultimately raise inflation, which has been stuck either side of zero for the past two years.\n\nBrexit may be the biggest single problem, threatening to thwart a modest investment and consumption-led recovery. But the ECB simply does not have enough information to work with.\n\nEarly data, such as Germany\'s ZEW sentiment indicator and euro zone consumer confidence figures, suggest a significant drop in confidence. But such surveys are prone to sharp swings and the ECB would need a larger body of evidence to act.\n\nIndeed, while analysts polled by Reuters cut their 2017 euro zone growth forecasts to 1.3 percent from 1.6 percent, they left their inflation projection unchanged at 1.3 percent, a mixed reading for the ECB, which targets inflation at just below 2 percent.\n\nDraghi is expected to argue that Brexit is a political problem, requiring governments, not the central bank to act, a call that is likely to fall on deaf ears, much like his repeated pleas for structural reforms that could lift potential growth.\n\n""Mr Draghi\'s calls for a loosening of the purse strings will go unheard, at least for now,"" BNP Paribas economist Luigi Speranza said. ""As things stand, then, the burden of responding to the Brexit shock will remain with the ECB, which is all too aware that it has fewer and fewer tools with which to respond.""\n\nConstraints\n\nWith interest rates deep in negative territory and asset buys running at 80 billion euros per month, the ECB is indeed running short on tools, raising the threshold for any further move if the bank is to preserve some firepower for any future shock.\n\nBut some policy changes are still likely in the coming months because the ECB is running out of qualified assets to buy, particularly Germany government debt, as yields fall below its -0.4 deposit rate, a self-imposed limit for its buys.\n\nThe dilemma will be whether to tweak the scheme, making just technical changes, or enact a broader but more controversial shift that could fundamentally alter the nature of the ECB\'s quantitative easing.\n\n""Technical problems can be solved but they underline the limits of what can be achieved by using solely monetary policy, something Draghi is very much aware of and one of the reasons why he constantly calls for a more growth-friendly fiscal policy,"" financial services group Nordea said.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters see mostly technical changes for now, including purchases of bonds yielding less than the deposit rate and buying a bigger portion of bonds without collective action clauses.\n\nMore fundamental changes may still come later, especially as the vast majority of analysts expect the asset buys to be extended beyond their current scheduled end next March and technical tweaks may not be enough to accommodate a major extension.\n\nItalian banks, weighed down by about a 360 billion euro ($400 billion) bad debt and falling share prices, are also likely to be on Draghi\'s agenda.\n\nThe Italian government is in talks with the EU to allow state aid to the troubled lenders but wants to shield household investors, a contentious proposal that would test the EU\'s bail-in rules.\n\nThough the ECB has no direct say in the matter, it still has a vested interest as it is the sector\'s main supervisor and banks are the main transmitters of its monetary policy.\n\nThe ECB has also argued that European rules leave room for state aid, referring to provisions which allow for shielding private investors from losses to preserve financial stability.\n\n(Editing by Jeremy Gaunt and Andrew Heavens)']"
07/22/2016,"['Image copyright Reuters Image caption Shavers said he ""royally messed up"" by running the fraudulent scheme\n\nA Texan man has been sentenced to 18 months in jail for running a fraudulent Ponzi-style scheme based around the Bitcoin virtual currency.\n\nThe scheme - run by Trendon Shavers - promised high returns to those who backed bitcoin-related investments.\n\nInstead of investing cash, Shavers used it to pay early investors in the scheme and to amass bitcoins.\n\nInvestors who backed the scheme lost about $1.23m (£940,000) in total, said Shavers\' lawyers.\n\nShavers has been ordered by the court to repay the money which investors lost.\n\nFamily money\n\nHe was arrested in 2014 for running the scheme which, at one point, controlled about 764,000 bitcoins. In 2011-12, when the scheme was operating, this was worth approximately $4.5m, comprising of 7% of all bitcoins in circulation.\n\nInvestors were attracted by Shavers offering them the chance to earn 7% interest every week. He said the returns to fund these rewards would be generated when he traded bitcoins across different exchanges.\n\nOnly a fraction of the bitcoins bought were invested and the rest were used to pay back those who were first to join the scheme. In addition, court papers revealed, Shavers used more than $220,000 of the cash to buy a BMW, holiday in Las Vegas and cover family expenses.\n\n""I don\'t think this is something I\'m ever going to get over but I\'m going to try to make things right,"" said Shavers in court, telling the judge that he ""royally messed up"".\n\nUS federal sentencing guidelines suggested Shavers would spend three years in jail but the judge reduced the sentence because of the ""honest work"" the Texan has done since his arrest. Shavers now makes his living as a cook.\n\nHe is believed to be the first person to face federal securities fraud charges involving bitcoins.', 'If you think about it from a crypto economics perspective, what happened to Bitcoin this week with the inclusion of Ethereum on Coinbase is frankly devastating to Bitcoin\'s brand image - and utility.\n\nCoinbase, founded in 2012, sitting on a fat 4.1 million customer userbase, and backed by some of the deepest pockets in Silicon Valley... the crypto services giant had always been staunchly a believer in Bitcoin exclusivity until this week\'s rollout.\n\nAs wildly exciting as the Ethereum community and ecosystem are becoming, in the back of one\'s mind was the realization that it is still not in the same league as Bitcoin - can\'t move it onto Coinbase and have it in my bank account as fiat currency the next day. Can\'t buy it on Coinbase with a MasterCard instant buy.\n\nLike every ""alt"" crypto project before it, Ethereum was relegated to a bizarre secondary realm which typically involved trading bitcoins for Ether on a third party exchange web site - or using an institutional level crypto trading platform, with the minimums and exhausting user identity processes that institutional level account openings can come with.\n\nNow that\'s all different. Coinbase has Ether on an equal footing with Bitcoin on the company\'s Trade page, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nWith the Ether name and blockchain now opened up to millions of new households, and with millions of Coinbase users able to convert Bitcoin into Ether with ease and security... it will be interesting to see if the recent ETH/BTC trading ratios are maintained, given the massive increase in freedom that\'s been granted to their userbase by adding a second currency.\n\nMaybe Bitcoin users are all absolute loyalists as the louder thought leaders of the community sometimes portray themselves.\n\nBut maybe they aren\'t. Maybe they are just interested in cryptocurrency, and if they see a swiftly climbing exchange rate, their loyalties might shift at the click of a mouse. Time will tell one way or another with certainty.\n\nMost immediately damaging to the Bitcoin absolutist\'s future prospects, however, is a comment dropped today by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam during a Q&A he offered on Ethereum\'s Reddit community.\n\n""Does Coinbase plan on implementing other cryptocurrencies? If so, which ones and why?"" a user asked.\n\nHis answer is sure to knock the breath out of Bitcoin absolutists on every continent:\n\n""Yes. I view us as cryptocurrency/cryptoasset agnostic long term. However, I do have a view on cryptocurrencies vs cryptoassets. I think a lot of the early cryptocurrencies after bitcoin (""altcoins"") were great from an experimentation perspective but not valuable because they tried to do the same thing Bitcoin did: create a network where the goal is store of value and transaction abilities. Ethereum was the first thing to me to come along and create something with capabilities so new that it was worth adding. Allowing arbitrary programs is amazing, fiddling with block time/inflation rate is not. I think we are now getting a different wave: digital assets instead of digital currencies. And this is far more interesting. So I think the future is thousands/millions of cryptoassets like we have millions of apps and web sites, but very few base networks.

At issue, is that they were initially used in a narrow context (usually to describe bitcoin\'s blockchain), and are now being interpreted more generically for other blockchains, in cases where they may no longer apply.\n\nIn this post, I hope to untangle some of these common misconceptions.\n\nTheme: Blockchains are secure\n\nWriting data\n\nBitcoin has specific security features for writing data due to the burden of proof-of-work consensus. That is, in order to add blocks of transactions to the blockchain, you have to validate all the transactions within the block (easy) and then perform repeated calculations (called hashing) to find a magic number that makes your block valid and acceptable to the other participants according to the rules of the network (easy, but computationally expensive, therefore energy intensive, therefore expensive). This proof-of-work burden combined with the longest chain rule makes it expensive to mine your own subversive chain.\n\nPrivate blockchains on the other hand, with known block validators, may have other mechanisms replacing proof-of-work that limit the ability of others to subvert the chain.\n\nThese rules can specify that blocks need to be signed by a limited, known list of signatories. The round-robin fashion by which entities take it in turns to write blocks is enough to discourage or limit unilateral bad behavior.\n\nReading data\n\nBitcoin, and blockchains, do not have inherent security against read access. Indeed, blockchains are mechanisms for copying data to all relevant participants – this is what consensus is all about.\n\nIf you think you have cybersecurity headaches controlling read-access to one central database, then multiply that by the number of nodes in your blockchain to get the new attack surface area of your blockchain.\n\nYou can control read-access to some degree by encrypting certain elements on your blockchain and handing out the keys to the relevant participant. But, consider the threat of industrial espionage where keys are sold to a rival organization who also runs a node – now the rival can read your data without even penetrating your system, because the blockchain is copying the data right into his data centre!\n\nThere may be solutions here involving key-rotation, but historical data also needs considering. The value of the third party is that they can control access to the data more finely. They also provide a single entity to litigate against if they expose private data or they breach their contractual obligations.\n\nDenial of service\n\nBlockchains are more resilient than centralised systems against denial-of-service attacks, due to their peer-to-peer, multi-redundant nature. If one node is taken offline, the others keep working.\n\nUsers connected to the disabled node will be unable to connect, unless there is a mechanism in place for them to find other nodes to fall back to.\n\nTheme: Blockchains are encrypted\n\nThere can be confusion between the cryptographic methods used in bitcoin (hashing, digital signatures) and data on blockchains being encrypted (data stored as cyphertext).\n\nThis can lead people to think that data on a blockchain is by default encrypted.\n\nIn fact, data on blockchains is by default unencrypted, especially data that needs to be validated by the nodes. In bitcoin, transaction data is not encrypted, as you can see by looking at any transaction in bitcoin\'s blockchain. (For a deeper explanation of the specific elements in a bitcoin transaction, see here).\n\nThe most apparent problem with encrypting data on a blockchain is that the encrypted data can’t be validated, because nodes need to know what they are validating.\n\nFor example, if I am validating the legitimacy of your payment of 2 BTC from your wallet, I need to know the contents of your wallet (ie your previous inbound transactions) and the fact that you are trying to spend 2 BTC (and which ones).\n\nIn a private chain, if all validating nodes can decrypt your data by having decryption keys, then you need to consider why you are encrypting it in the first place.\n\nThere are solutions emerging from primary cryptographic research that allow for facts to be proven about data without knowing the underlying data itself, known as zero-knowledge proofs, but this technology is not currently mature.\n\nIf privacy is important, then consider what needs to be encrypted: All data at rest? Data in motion? The whole database? Data within specific database fields? And who will be able to decrypt it and when? How will permissions be granted? Can permissions be revoked? What happens if a third party gets a decryption key through a rogue staff member? What happens if a legitimate user loses a decryption key?\n\nKey management is a crucial part of data security – even more so when the data is freely shared between (usually) competitors in an industry, and it needs to be carefully considered in a blockchain solution.\n\nTheme: Using a blockchain allows better access to data\n\nMany existing centralised solutions already do an excellent job of allowing access to data, with carefully controlled read and write access, and also a layer of accountability on the central owner of the data who can react to either moral imperatives or legal directives.\n\nFacebook, for instance, is quite accessible globally, and it can take down hate speech or copyrighted material.\n\nBlockchains can make access control to data more complex, and immutability is not without its downsides. In many potential use cases, nodes are run by a separate entities or groups (if they’re not, then consider why you’re using a blockchain in the first place), and each entity controls and manages its own access control to the data.\n\nThere may be challenges around managing access control across all entities that have a copy of the blockchain data.\n\nTheme: This blockchain allows end users to do [x] peer-to-peer without a middleman\n\nThis narrative seems to have come from bitcoin’s whitepaper, which describes the purpose of bitcoin to allow people to send digital cash from person to person without a specific financial intermediary.\n\nIf you count the miner adding the block as an intermediary who collects fees and rewards for his work, then there are intermediaries in bitcoin. But, the point is that they are not specific (one miner can substitute for another), and you are not beholden to a specific miner for your transactions to work or not.\n\nFor many private blockchains currently being described in industry, there are middlemen – these are the participants running the nodes, or the technology vendors clipping tickets to monetize their blockchain solutions.\n\nTheme: Users will run their own blockchains on their phones\n\nI have occasionally heard ideas where users need to store blockchain data on their phones (especially for use cases where users should own their own data).\n\nBeware the mobile phone blockchain, as it implies that the phone will be constantly chatting to the rest of the network, downloading and uploading other people’s data non-stop to remain in consensus.\n\nTheme: The blockchain will be an immutable record of all events\n\nIn bitcoin, where old transactions need to be tracked in order to figure out the validity of new transactions, this is the case.\n\nIt is also the case that a bitcoin transaction only ""happens"" or settles if it is broadcast to the bitcoin network and is accepted into a block. Each event in bitcoin is a necessary event to build up the picture of the state of the ledger.\n\nThis does not mean that if you throw a blockchain at a random problem, you will immediately accurately capture every single event.\n\nEvents need to be input by someone or something and then broadcast and accepted for them to be recorded.\n\nData on a blockchain doesn’t imply accuracy – events need to be recorded accurately in the first place. This is even more important when the record may be immutable.\n\nTheme: Because it’s on a blockchain, it’s true\n\nThis is a confusion around use of the word ""true"".\n\nIn bitcoin, ""true"" means that the network has agreed that a transaction has taken place, and nodes are in agreement or consensus that this has happened.\n\nThe concept of ""truth"" as applied to blockchains doesn’t extend to other meanings of ""true"". If a heart-monitoring piece of hardware becomes faulty and records incorrect heart-rate readings onto a blockchain, do the readings become truth? Clearly not.\n\nOn a registry of car ownership, a blockchain may immutably record that a car has changed owner. If this transaction was made in error or fraudulently due to a hacking of the owner’s phone, what is the state of the truth? If the transaction was found to be fraudulent by the police and needs to be ‘unwound’, then how will that be done, given the cryptographic security of digital signatures? (There are solutions, but they just need to be thought through).\n\nIn the case of blockchains, truth just means ""what was originally recorded and agreed as valid by the majority of the nodes"".\n\nValid doesn’t necessarily mean true. Don’t confuse blockchain truth with ""The Truth"". For a trivial but concrete example of an immutable lie on multiple levels, see here.\n\nTheme: Data stored on a blockchain\n\nThis is prevalent in the blockchains-for-KYC and blockchains-for-document-storage space.\n\nComments such as \'This is stored on the blockchain\' can cause confusion when a hash of a document (PDF, JPEG, etc) is published to a blockchain. A hash is not an encrypted version of an original file; and when a hash is stored, you can’t retrieve the original by decrypting the hash. The hash of a fingerprint of the data, and if it is stored on a blockchain, someone who has kept an exact copy of that data (off chain) can prove that that specific data existed at the timestamp when the hash was stored on the blockchain.\n\nWhile you can store whole documents on blockchains (after all a blockchain is just a database coupled with software that validates and shares new entries to the other participants), passing large chunks of data around at speed can create its own set of problems.\n\nTheme: Participants to a blockchain\n\nThere can be confusion when the word ""participants"" is used.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are three main types of participants to blockchains:\n\nParticipants who write blocks (in bitcoin, these are called miners and they crunch numbers)\n\nParticipants who maintain the entire blockchain and validate and propagate new entries (in bitcoin, these are generally called \'full nodes\')\n\nParticipants who are the end users of the functionality of the blockchain, usually accessing the blockchain by connecting to a full node (in bitcoin, these are generally called users)\n\nIt may be best to always spell out exactly which participants are being referred to.\n\nTheme: Well, what should I use a blockchain for?\n\nBlockchains are great when multiple parties need to read the same information, but for whatever reason there can’t be or shouldn’t be any specific individual party in control of that data.\n\nGideon Greenspan has written a great article about avoiding the pointless blockchain project, and later described some genuine use cases in a follow-up post.\n\nTheme: If I use the word ‘blockchain’ I can get budget\n\nGo for it!\n\nThe only way the technology will improve is by people trying it and adapting it to fit problems better.\n\nTry to understand and be aware of the limitations and complexities early and be careful about over-fitting a trendy technical solution to a problem.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lewis\'s blog \'Bits on Blocks\', and has been republished here with his permission.\n\nLost in thought image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

""The response from our community was swift and tremendous,"" says Plutus CCO Filip Martinka.\n\nPlutus Tap & Pay is an upcoming Android-only mobile app which lets users make Bitcoin and Ethereum contactless (NFC) payments at any existing merchant with a compatible device. This means that it removes what is commonly seen as the largest barrier to the usage of digital currencies - merchant adoption. Customers no longer have to wait for merchants to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum directly.\n\nHowever, the unique advantage of Plutus is behind the scenes - the PlutusDEX. While Plutus Tap & Pay already has a working proof-of-concept, the crowdfund has now secured development of the PlutusDEX - a peer-to-peer exchange which will provide native liquidity for the app itself through decentralized smart contracts while offering traders zero fees.\n\nInstead of using an existing exchange and their additional risks and fees, or engaging in the high costs it requires to run one, Plutus.it will enable users to trade among themselves as well as enable other exchanges to plug into the network. Traders escrow fiat, users send digital currencies, and the PlutusDEX handles the rest.\n\n""Whenever you make a deposit with Bitcoin or Ethereum, you will also gain a reward in Plutons from the network automatically. We created this model to incentivise users as well as expand our feature-set in the future. Plutons exist autonomously on the Ethereum blockchain and are sufficiently rare to create an advantage for early adopters,"" added Plutus CEO and Founder Danial Daychopan, an experienced entrepreneur in the cryptocurrency payments sector.\n\nEveryone who participated in the crowdsale has thereby secured a balance of Plutons, payment tokens which are equivalent to Bitcoin and Ethereum within the Plutus payment network, with the added advantage of faster transactions and more importantly, zero fees on the Plutus app.\n\nIn addition to raising over $1 million USD and building a growing user base of thousands of members, Plutus has also attracted former senior business manager Bertrand Dezard from VISA and Braintree / Paypal to join its team as CPO (chief payments officer), as well as Tobias Sommer, former VP of various teams at Evercore, who spent 5 years at Morgan Stanley as an analyst, another five years investing into European Buyouts for Arcapita, and now acts as COO at Plutus.\n\nPlutus has been featured on numerous other news outlets including IBTimes, CCN, Bitcoin.com, and various podcasts in the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, Plutus was chosen as one of the top 100 innovative start-ups at PIONEERS500, as well as one of the top 3 at the Visa Contactless Intelligence Conference in the category Next Generation Ecosystems.', 'While mainstream adoption grows everyday, Bitcoin still traces its roots to the tech community. A 2013 survey of Bitcoin users found them to be 96% male, 37% anarcho-capitalist or libertarian, and with a median age of 32.7 years old. The clear majority found Bitcoin to be intellectually rewarding (70%), while a much smaller portion used it to broaden their social circles (22%). As cryptocurrency seeks to expand adoption, people outside the traditional tech community remain a sought-after demographic.\n\nCryptoart is a project that serves this purpose of bringing Bitcoin beyond its traditional social circles by creating art pieces related to cryptocurrency and affixing them with paper wallets, allowing the art piece itself to serve as a store of currency. CoinTelegraph spoke with Troy Fearnow of Cryptoart about taking Bitcoin into culture.\n\nCoinTelegraph: This seems like a very non-typical idea for the Bitcoin community. What was the inspiration?\n\nTroy Fearnow: As a Bitcoiner I wanted to contribute in some way. I spent much of my professional career dealing art. One day I was printing off paper wallets and came up with the idea to merge them with physical art. It just seemed like a fun way to secure and enjoy my Bitcoin. Additionally, The concept of growing value by creating demand and introducing scarcity is interesting to me.\n\nCT: Is Cryptoart something that can be used as a way to hide one\'s finances from theft?\n\nTF: The art is just a vessel to hold a paper wallet, so yes. The QR code and paper wallet can be switched out. I felt it was important to observe trustlessness.\n\nCT: Any success in the art gallery/coffee shop world as a way to display art?\n\nTF: I\'ve had a few retail experiences -- some exceptional and some not. Obviously, the crowd is important. We had a pop-up gallery at SXSW that was fantastic, but that is really the perfect audience. I test marketed a mall and had mixed results. In all instances, Cryptoart requires some explanation. You need someone with knowledge that can talk to the customer, which means traditional retail or galleries is challenging. I don\'t view this as a negative, because the ultimate goal is to bring new people into the world of digital currencies.\n\nCryptoart is an effective teaching tool, because it forces people to think about how Bitcoin can ""be on the art."" Specifically, it\'s a great tool to understand that Bitcoin is an entry on a distributed ledger that is controlled by your private key. People also find it interesting that a Bitcoin address can be created without logging into some sort of centralized database. These are empowering concepts once you grasp them.\n\nCT: Have you seen a ""busking"" approach where artists display their art for crypto tips?\n\nTF: I\'m sure crypto tips will be a normal part of busking in the future, it\'s just not something we are concentrating on.\n\nCT: Who are the artists and where do they come from? I’d imagine it could be challenging to find people at the nexus of these two very different worlds.\n\nTF: At this point it is by invitation. We find artists online. It’s actually the hardest part. We do have a creative studio that did one piece that used multiple artists. Two Dots Creative Studio in France has very talented artists. They’ve done work on Assassin’s Creed and Star Wars.\n\nCT: Art is certainly a departure of sorts from the norm of the coder nerd-filled crypto world. Over your years of involvement, have you seen a shift towards more artists and ""regular folks""?\n\nTF: Artistic efforts are becoming more collaborative inside the Bitcoin space. I did a show in San Francisco about six weeks ago that included many of the Bitcoin artists. There is another show in the works right now. In terms of regular folks, it depends where you live. I’m in Austin where most folks have heard about Bitcoin, they just haven’t made the leap to ownership yet. As a side note—This is why Cryptoart comes with a tutorial. The idea is to give new users a painless bridge instead of making a big leap.', ""South Africa’s Llew Claasen was appointed as the new Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation because they think he has the skill that is needed now to move the Foundation forward. He said that there is an amazing opportunity for the organization to help the Bitcoin ecosystem. In this interview, he sheds light on his appointment and the organisation he leads.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Did your appointment as the executive director of Bitcoin Foundation come as a surprise?\u200b\n\nLlew Claasen: Yes! I was in Italy on vacation at the time that the Board approved my appointment and within days I was on a plane to Toronto for the announcement. I had been discussing the position with the Board for a few weeks before that, following the decision of Bruce Fenton to step down as the Executive Director of the Foundation.\n\nCT: \u200bI believe your focus would be on improving Bitcoin adoption and use?\n\nLC: We believe that the most important uses of Bitcoin are as a medium of exchange and as a store of value and this is where we will focus our advocacy programs. As a technology, we're still firmly in early adopter territory, so our programs will be focused on outreach for engineers, especially software engineers.\n\nAcceleration of Bitcoin adoption\n\nCT: It takes several qualities to steer the wheel of a global \u200bindustry group \u200bthat is \u200bfocused on Bitcoin with a variety of corporate members, individuals and international chapters. \u200bWhat factors or skills would you rely on to see you through the tasks ahead?\n\nLC: Running a non-profit foundation for an open source project that was founded on a philosophy of privacy, decentralized trust and distributed effort is certainly going to be a challenge. There is no obvious precedent for such an organizational structure. We believe that any attempt by the Foundation to exercise command or control within the Bitcoin community will fail. Rather, we see ourselves as being most useful to the Bitcoin community if we play a coordination function. Our ability to influence positive outcomes for Bitcoin will be directly related to how well are able to enable players to coordinate their efforts to accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin globally.\n\n\u200bCT: Have you started speaking with individual members, corporations, developers and the \u200bBitcoin \u200bcommunity\u200b\u200b? If yes, what's the reaction like so far?\u200b\n\nLC: I have. It's the most important thing that I am doing during the first few weeks in this position. I've had many phone calls and face-to-face discussions with people across the ecosystem and we've surveyed our members and close communities as well. I'm currently broadening the scope of these discussions to people outside of North America and that outreach is starting to yield very important discussions and insights. There is a very small group of people that question the relevance of the Foundation, but most Bitcoin community members that I've engaged with want to see leadership from us.\n\nBitcoin as a killer app\n\nCT: Where do you see Bitcoin in the next few years?\n\nLC: I believe that the adoption of Bitcoin will follow a similar but more accelerated trajectory to the adoption of the internet during the Information Age. We think the killer app is the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, not the blockchain or distributed ledger. We think we've just entered the Value Age.\n\nCT: What's your view on scalability?\n\nLC: We have very smart people in the Bitcoin community working on this problem. They don't always all agree with each other on what the best approach is to take. This is normal behaviour that is just more visible in an open source community. Our function as a Foundation is not to make technology choices, but where relevant, to enable conversations between smart people and ultimately, to support the longest chain. I think we all know that we need a new type of governance structure for Bitcoin, but because this is all so new to everyone, we don't have an elegant solution yet."", 'Bitcoin price decline intensifies.

Of course, there is no other asset out there that even comes close to Bitcoin’s super-fundamentals (censorship resistance, cryptographic security, mathematical consensus), yet, being unregulated (and beyond regulation by design) and floating freely in the open market, the price chart is traded up and down like any other commodity – irrespective of fundamentals or news events.\n\nThe 4hr view is shown in the attached chart.\n\nBreach of the ascending blue trendline signals that the largest players are willing to concede some selling – despite ample resources in a market with low liquidity, they failed to defend that trendline.\n\nConceivable S&R was annotated, in yesterday’s chart, with magenta arrows where Fib extension targets overlap with previous horizontal S&R at $600 and $560 (the previous decline low).\n\nA miracle may halt decline, but, from the technicals, it looks like a bout of selling is about to grip this market.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price continues decline.

Representatives of Kraken told Cointelegraph that the cases mentioned below are currently being investigated.\n\nUsers’ complaints\n\nIn an email to CoinTelegraph, a supposed Kraken user claimed in writing that:\n\n“Last few days many traders were robbed and their funds were drained from Kraken. People are angry and wants their money back. Like a Defender of Crypto World and respected media you can help a lot... Kraken must solve their security problems and this is fact.”\n\nOver on Reddit, a user u/MIkeHBrown, writes about how his Kraken account was robbed for not using 2FA.\n\n“My entire balance in BTC just got drained from Kraken and sent to an address that is not ours.

None of these changes were made by me! I had USD in the account which was used to buy BTC and all the BTC was withdrawn. I did not do any of this. I have opened a ticket with kraken support as soon as I found out but no response yet. Is anyone else seeing this happen to them?? Posted this on behalf of my brother /u/ds720 since he couldn't post on this subreddit. Expect replies from him.”\n\nKraken responds\n\nCaesar0901 later posted that he/she received a mail from Kraken based on the filed complaint which says:\n\n“Hi caesar0901, We detected a suspicious login attempt on your Kraken account this morning. The attempt provided your username but either did not provide the correct password or failed second factor authentication. The pattern of attempts we have observed is indicative of a potential data breach at another service where you may have used the same username. If you have reused your Kraken password with any other services, please immediately change your password.\n\n\n\nIt is strongly advised that passwords not be reused across services, that two-factor authentication be enabled on your Kraken account, and that you make use of the Global Settings Lock feature.\n\n\n\nMore information on securing your account in our help center: https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/201396837-What-can-I-do-to-make-my-Kraken-account-secure-\n\n\n\nAny information you are able to provide to our support team as to the potential source of the compromised credentials would be extremely helpful. For example, you might have recently provided your password to someone impersonating a Kraken employee, opened a suspicious email attachment or installed new software from an untrusted source. Or, you might know that you use the same password with another service (likely in the Bitcoin ecosystem) which has suffered a data breach.\n\n\n\nIf you are reusing your Kraken password at other services, please take a moment to secure those accounts with a new password and two-factor authentication. You might also do a Google search for ‘Password Manager’ and evaluate some options such as LastPass, KeePass and 1Password, which will help you create and manage strong, unique passwords for each service.\n\n\n\nThe Kraken Team.”\n\nThe writer claimed that “since Kraken does not confirm enabling (or disabling) 2FA on their users' accounts via email, the perpetrator successfully enabled 2FA, changed the Master key, changed the withdrawal addresses, and requested withdrawals -- all in under 5 minutes. Here is the email my brother received from Kraken when the perpetrator gained access to his account and made the withdrawals (emphasis mine):\n\n“Hi, A withdrawal request has been made for the withdrawal address named b.

Thanks for choosing Kraken Bitcoin Exchange The Kraken Team Note: if you didn't request this action, your account may be compromised and you should do the following: 1) log into https://www.kraken.com immediately and go to Account > Funding > Withdraw - you may be able to cancel the withdraw if you catch it soon enough. 2) change your password; 3) create a new set of two-factor authentications; 4) create a support ticket letting our support staff know about the incident: https://support.kraken.com. The IP recorded for this action was 201.140.110.78. Kraken has been investigating the breach of my brother's account and theft since this morning, and there have been a few updates and inquiries from Kraken on the support ticket about my brother's security practices. Although he should have been using 2FA from the moment he opened his account, we know that he does not use the same password or any variation of it on other websites, exchanges, or services. While my brother made a mistake not using 2FA, my concern is now with Kraken's seemingly cavalier security practices.”\n\nAside ensuring that two factor authorization is enabled and withdrawals made from exchanges, another point that came up that could possibly safeguard theft of funds in an exchange is for the platform to allow its users to set a delay for withdrawals."", 'Someone told my CCN post and published it on Steemit. They earned $400 [Editor’s note: The payout did not occur after the article was found to be plagiarized]. I earned substantially less. Why don’t I care? Because I am realistic about the nature of the Internet, the economy – and most importantly, Bitcoiners.\n\nI often hear people say that hard work pays off. This isn’t always the case. Many times, taking the easy route is the quickest way to make money. Dishonesty, theft and tearing others down. And isn’t that what the global economy has proved itself to be all about?\n\nBitcoiners love to tout “free markets.” Isn’t someone stealing another’s post and profiting to the tune of $400 the perfect example of “free market.”\n\nMany people discuss the Bitcoin “Community.” But, the Bitcoin Community is a marketing angle in order to entice newcomers to feel at home while entering into what’s determinedly nothing more than industry – with self-interest and plenty of lawyers (looking at you, Santori).\n\nYou can read the post at Steemit here.\n\nYou can read the original here.\n\nWhat is Steemit?\n\nSteemit is a social media platform where everyone gets paid for creating and curating content. It leverages a robust digital points system, called Steem, that supports real value for digital rewards through market price discovery and liquidity.\n\nSteemit claims to be a website that allows you to interact with its blockchain. The blockchain is a system where virtual currency is used to reward users who post, comment or rate posts. It’s kind of like Reddit but you are rewarded if people upvote your post with Steem, a digital token. The rewards are given out in 50% dollars and 50% steem power.\n\nThere are many things that can be done on Steem. You can write posts with photo and video links. You can upvote or downvote other’s posts. You get rewarded if your posts become popular on the website. The website claims this is all based on the blockchain, but there have been other website’s claiming to run their own blockchains without proof thereof.\n\nBitcoin publications – as they do with every new blockchain startup – claims it could be the “killer app” of Bitcoin. Only time can tell that.\n\nJust four days ago, Steemit was hacked for $85,000, another high-profile hack in the wake of the $55 million hack of the DAO.\n\nIn an official statement, CEO Ned Scott said the hack had “been contained.”\n\nUser accounts and wallets are not at risk, and we hope to soon reactivate the steemit website to normal order. Any users whose accounts were compromised will be completely reimbursed.\n\nSo why don’t I care someone stole my post and profited big? Because I don’t expect the economy to work any other way, let alone the Internet. Some of the most successful individuals in history have made themselves successful on the back of others. We see that here in the Bitcoin Community. (How many people are riding the back’s of Satoshi, claiming to be doing good work for the community?) My lack of expectations results in few disappointments.\n\nI hope that whoever stole the post and profited big on it gives some money away to charity or that they themselves needed that cash more than I did. They’re not to blame. Perhaps the naive who tipped the individual shoulder most the blame.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Steemit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
07/23/2016,"['Ethereum’s price has shot back up, bringing cryptocurrency’s market capitalization past $13 billion and bringing Bitcoin’s portion down below 80%\n\nThe price per Ether has risen to over $14 and its market cap from about $975 million to about $1.2 billion over the last week. Meanwhile, over the same time period Bitocin’s market cap fell from $10.5 billion to $10.28 billion, reducing its share of the global cryptocurrency market cap to below 80%.\n\nEthereum’s successful hard fork, Coinbase integration\n\nThe partial price and market cap recovery can be traced to Ethereum’s successful hard fork. The fork was agreed upon in response to the DAO hack, which resulted in the theft of a large amount of Ether. A proposed hard fork in the currency, isolating the stolen funds and rendering them without value, was readily agreed to by the Ethereum mining community and subsequently implemented, restoring confidence, and with it, value.\n\nAdditionally, cryptocurrency exchange/wallet provider/merchant solution Coinbase recently announced Ethereum integration, solidifying the currency’s place as being respected by the cryptocurrency “establishment.”\n\n“Age of altcoins” approaches as Bitcoin’s dominance slowly recedes\n\nBitcoin’s price and market cap have stagnated relative to the rise of alternative cryptocurrencies, having reached a peak market cap of almost $14 billion in late 2013, and currently valuing around $10.3 billion, 73.5% of its height. Meanwhile, combined altcoin market cap has risen to $2.75 billion, about 92% of its all-time high of $3 billion last month, 37.5% higher than its 2013 high of about $2 billion.\n\nAs fees and mempool of backlogged transactions continue to grow, alternative cryptocurrencies continue to make inroads, causing Bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency market to recede from around 95% in 2013 to below 80% now.', ""As teams behind Mycelium and Dash announced a partnership that will see the eighth most valued cryptocurrency available for sale and purchase on one of the highest rated software wallets, a top Dash official sees a new trend in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDash VP of Business Development Daniel Diaz says via email:\n\n“I think the industry is moving in a direction where the most popular wallets are going to offer more than one payment network to their users. Wallets will become Blockchain agnostic and let the users decide the network that suits their needs better for a specific application. We are thrilled to be working hand in hand with such a forward thinking company as Mycelium.”\n\nMycelium, one of the world’s first and top rated software wallets, will integrate with Dash which will come into effect in October to allow Mycelium users to buy, sell and hold Dash, whose unique characteristics include extremely low fees, advanced encryption, instant transactions, and optional payment privacy through pool mixing technology.\n\nDash is like digital cash managed by a self funded, self governed organization comprised of over 15,000 users who move half a million dollars across the network every 24 hours. It can be spent instantly online and at merchants and service providers worldwide with transactions verified by miners and its system protected by 4,000 master nodes across the world. Its in-built governance and funding system allows projects to be proposed and voted on by the community, and if approved, paid for directly from the Blockchain.\n\nThe partnership is a testimony to the Dash system’s ability to make agreements with traditional corporations and keep its commitments while being a DAO.\n\nMycelium’s vision of a crypto hub\n\nDiaz says partnering with Mycelium, which has a vision of becoming a hub for crypto financial services, will increase the thousands of people using Dash as a stable alternative to Bitcoin and perfectly suited to the mobile user.\n\nHe adds:\n\n“Dash has a series of added value properties that give it competitive advantage to other cryptocurrencies. It has a decentralized governance system, Blockchain funding, full node incentive, instant transactions and embedded privacy, but only users that can access the Dash network by acquiring coins can take advantage of these properties. So we have a strong focus in improving on-ramps and making it easier for users to get Dash. This partnership will help improve access to Dash by making it accessible to all users of the Mycelium wallets; our plan is to also include broker integration so that people can buy Dash directly inside the wallet.”\n\nSecond-largest Bitcoin-based network\n\nAs a true stable alternative to Bitcoin, he explains:\n\n“Dash has cash-like properties that make it more suitable for day to day use, Point of Sale, tipping and several other applications. It offers instant transaction locking, an option of privacy for users that want it and also an option to be as transparent as Bitcoin for those that require it. It can also complement Bitcoin very well. Bitcoin has been transitioning into the role of a settlement layer that is providing value to the whole industry. The Dash Blockchain is currently 1.4 GB, it is on its first generation of ASIC miners and has 4303 active full nodes comprising our masternode network (https://bitinfocharts.com/). As a reference, Bitcoin has 5487 active full nodes (https://bitnodes.21.co/) and a 90 GB Blockchain (https://bitinfocharts.com). That means the Dash network is 78% the size of Bitcoin's and the Dash Blockchain is still small enough to carry a full copy of the ledger in a mobile device, making it a true stable alternative. Dash has the second largest network of any Bitcoin based currency by far. Further, the Dash organization is hyperactive on the development side, and is experimenting in interesting areas like full node incentive, decentralized governance, Blockchain based funding, and instant transaction confirmations. We are also actively researching and working on more areas, as well as planning upcoming software integration projects and partnerships. We feel it is the responsibility of younger networks to make an effort to add value to the ecosystem; we are all standing on the shoulders of giants and have a responsibility to give back. For all these reasons, Dash is a stable alternative to Bitcoin and I would say the digital cash to Bitcoin's digital gold.”\n\nHe believes Dash’s open source collaboration backed by Blockchain funding is a strong competitive advantage that will make the currency an important player in the future.\n\nMycelium is currently having a wallet redesign to implement a more modular and simpler system to support even more open source technologies that would make them switch from their proprietary BitLib library to the much more popular BitcoinJ.\n\nBitcoinJ is an open source Bitcoin client library built in Java, originally built by Mike Hearn. It can maintain a wallet, send/receive transactions without needing a local copy of Bitcoin Core and has many other advanced features. It is the most popular and best maintained library."", 'Mining the wealth of information in the BitCoin blockchain is nothing new, but BitCluster goes a long way to make sense of the information you’ll find there. The tool was released by Mathieu Lavoie and David Decary-Hetu, PH.D. on Friday following their talk at HOPE XI.\n\nI greatly enjoyed sitting in on the talk which began with some BitCoin basics. The cryptocurrency uses user generated “wallets” which are essentially addresses that identify transactions. Each is established using key pairs and there are roughly 146 million of these wallets in existence now\n\nIf you’re a thrifty person you might think you can get one wallet and use it for years. That might be true of the sweaty alligator-skin nightmare you’ve had in your back pocket for a decade now. It’s not true when it comes to digital bits — they’re cheap (some would say free). People who don’t generate a new wallet for every transaction weaken their BitCoin anonymity and this weakness is the core of BitCluster’s approach.\n\nEvery time you transfer BitCoin (BTC) you send the network the address of the transaction when you acquired the BTCs and sign it with your key to validate the data. If you reuse the same wallet address on subsequent transactions — maybe because you didn’t spend all of the wallet’s coins in one transaction or you overpaid and have the change routed back to your wallet. The uniqueness of that signed address can be tracked across those multiple transactions. This alone won’t dox you, but does allow a clever piece of software to build a database of nodes by associating transactions together.\n\nMathieu’s description of first attempts at mapping the blockchain were amusing. The demonstration showed a Python script called from the command line which started off analyzing a little more than a block a second but by the fourth or fifth blocks hit the process had slowed to a standstill that would never progress. This reminds me of some of the puzzles from Project Euler.\n\nAfter a rabbit hole of optimizations the problem has been solved. All you need to recreate the work is a pair of machines (one for Python one for mondoDB) with the fastest processors you can afford, a 500 GB SSD, 32 GB of RAM (but would be 64 better), Python 64-bit, and at least a week of time. The good news is that you don’t have to recreate this. The 200GB database is available for download through a torrent and the code to navigate it is up on GitHub. Like I said, this type of blockchain sleuthing isn’t new but a powerful open source tool like this is.\n\nBoth Ransomware and illicit markets can be observed using this technique. Successful, yet not-so-cautious ransomers sometimes use the same BitCoin address for all payments. For example, research into a 2014 data sample turned up a ransomware instance that pulled in $611k (averaging $10k per day but actually pulling in most of the money during one three-week period). If you’re paying attention you know using the same wallet address is a bad move and this ransomware was eventually shut down.\n\nIllicit markets like Silk Road are another application for BitCluster. Prior research methods relied on mining comments left by customers to estimate revenue. Imagine if you had to guess at how well Amazon was doing reading customer reviews and hoping they mentioned the price? The ability to observe BTC payment nodes is a much more powerful method.\n\nA good illicit market won’t use just one wallet address. But to protect customers they use escrow address and these do get reused making cluster analysis possible. Silk Road was doing about $800k per month in revenue at its height. The bulk of purchases were for less than $500 with only a tiny percentage above $1000. But those large purchases were likely to be drug purchases of a kilo or more. That small sliver of total transactions actually added up to about a third of the total revenue.\n\nIt’s fascinating to peer into transactions in this manner. And the good news is that there’s plenty of interesting stuff just waiting to be discovered. After all, the blockchain is a historical record so the data isn’t going anywhere. BitCluster is intriguing and worth playing with. Currently you can search for a BTC address and see total BTC in and out, then sift through income and expense sorted by date, amount, etc. But the tool can be truly great with more development. On the top of the wishlist are automated database updates, labeling of nodes (so you can search “Silk Road” instead of a numerical address), visual graphs of flows, and a hosted version of the query tool (but computing power becomes prohibitive.)', 'While steem recently became the third-largest digital currency as measured by market capitalization, surpassing $400 million this month, some market experts are skeptical of steem and have expressed doubts about its economics.\n\nThe digital currency’s market capitalization surged in July, rising more than 2,000% from $17.9M to $411.9M between 04:14 UTC on 6th July and the same time on 20th July, CoinMarketCap figures reveal. The digital currency’s price climbed more than 1,800% during this period, increasing from $0.24 to $4.63.\n\nFor those new to the digital currency, users can obtain steem by posting content on social media platform named Steemit. When users publish popular content, as measured by upvotes, they receive steem tokens. By developing such a platform, Steemit’s creators have stated that they want to allow users to receive a reward for the content they create.\n\n""The concept itself is interesting, it is a Reddit and Quora mashup with a strong monetary incentive to produce good quality content,"" Joe Lee, co-founder and CIO of digital currency trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk. ""Whether steem succeeds as a digital currency will be more a reflection of Steemit’s success as a platform as opposed to the economics of the coin itself. This is a good example of a digital currency whose value will be closely affiliated to its utilitarian value as a social networking and sharing platform.""\n\nMarket Observers Skeptical\n\nWhile Lee offered some positive remarks about both the digital currency and its underlying social media platform, several market observers quickly voiced their doubts. “I’m skeptical about \'appcoins\'/\'appchains,\' and Steem is very much one,” stated algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff.\n\n""It’s great to set up a site that rewards upvoted content,"" he noted. However, doing so is ""borderline illegal"" unless it is done very carefully. Past that, he asked why the platform needs a new currency, instead of using an existing digital currency like bitcoin or ether.\n\nEliosoff also expressed concerns about steem’s use of a dollar peg, which ARK Invest’s Chris Burniske described as being made possible through the use of a decentralized marketplace which sets interest rates that in turn ""keep steem dollars properly pegged to the U.S. dollar.""\n\n""Real dollar pegs are very expensive,"" said Eliosoff, adding that ""to my knowledge no (or next to no) cryptocoins have pulled one off.""\n\nPotential Scam\n\nSome market observers expressed their concerns that steem in and of itself might be either a pump and dump scam or a Ponzi scheme.\n\n""My first impression is that it is a \'pump and dump\' crypto where accumulators (founders, early adopters) will be looking to cash out on a major pump in price (distribution),” stated Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub. ""Whether it survives longer term remains to be proven.""\n\nKong Gao, overseas marketing manager for bitcoin trader Richfund, provided similar concerns about steem. ""Most of the articles on Steemit are promoting steem, which makes it seem like a variation of a Ponzi [scheme]. Furthermore, it is the same group of people behind Bitshares."" As a result, ""I don’t think it is sustainable and I don\'t take it seriously. I\'ve also spoken with a couple of serious altcoin traders in China” and they have their doubts as well.\n\nEliosoff reiterated Gao\'s point that steem might be a Ponzi scheme, predicting that the digital currency ""will grow and grow until there are no fresh users to suck in and then quickly collapse,"" a situation he described as being ""the Ponzi way.""\n\nSteem Power\n\nThe creators of Steemit have responded to criticisms like these, emphasizing that they have built certain safeguards into the system to provide users with greater incentive to hold on to their steem tokens. One such feature is Steem Power.\n\n""Because Steem wants to encourage long-term growth, it is hardwired to allocate nine steem to Steem Power (SP) stakeholders for every one steem it creates to fund growth through contribution incentives,"" the steem whitepaper stated. ""Over time this drives the ratio of the total Steem value of Steem Power balances to the total of steem balances toward nine-to-one.""\n\n""Long-term holders are almost completely protected from the dilution used to fund growth"" as a result of this setup, the white paper continues. Past that, the ""Steem power can only be converted back to steem over two years via 104 equal payments.""\n\nBurniske spoke to the benefits of Steem Power, telling CoinDesk it could help provide the digital currency with the stability it needs.\n\n""Locking people into Steem Power for 2 years is a good way to secure long term capital commitment that will help the platform retain a steady base, hopefully giving it the runway it needs to establish sustainable user and developer network effects,"" he stated. ""This is an interesting neutralizer to the \'burn fast, burn bright\' that we often see with new cryptocurrency platforms.""\n\nWhile steem’s innovative approach has helped it rise above the vast majority of crytocurrencies and become the third-largest in terms of market capitalization, only time will tell whether its business model will be sustainable. Until that point, the digital currency will probably not lack for attention, as many market observers will be taking a closer look at steem to see whether its approach is sustainable.\n\nSteam gauges image via shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But here, we are focusing on the security of Bitcoin wallets and effective ways of protecting the private keys and passwords.\n\nOne of the members on BitcoinTalk, Wisdom Oparaocha who goes by the screen name NyeFe has published a new open source security standard for securing Bitcoin cold wallets. The project called SSI Bitcoin Storage described by the original poster (OP) is said to use two cryptographic techniques, AES 128-bit encryption and Steganography to secure the wallet information.\n\nAccording to NyeFe, the implementation of CryptoStandard SSI Bitcoin Storage Protocol involves the following steps,\n\nStep 1 – Creation of a Bitcoin wallet, where the wallet addresses are generated offline to prevent any leaks.\n\nStep 2 – The wallets created should be encrypted using AES 128-bits X2, 32-character hash encryption protocol.\n\nStep 3 – The encrypted wallet is then stored within the pixels of an image in the form of RGB data using Steganographic methods.\n\nBy following the steps one can create and store a secure Bitcoin wallet inside a regular image. The whole process is done using the CryptoStandard SSI Bitcoin Storage software. Anyone using the computer will just see an image without a clue about the actual worth of that image file.\n\nNyeFe also includes a sample in the post, with two similar images of a flower. While there is nothing special about the first image, the one that follows, though identical holds a wallet with 100 cryptographic keys. In order to access it, the user has to download the CryptoStandard SSI Bitcoin Storage software and run the image through it.\n\nImage 1\n\nImage 2 (the one with hidden wallet)\n\nIncluded in the post are links to the GitHub repository where one can download the CryptoStandard SSI Bitcoin Storage software.\n\nAccording to NyeFe,\n\n“CryptoStandard is mainly focused on open-source development of cross platform, offline or networked security software for established or new standards. “\n\nWhile there are other players who are involved in the development of security standards software for the Cryptocurrency industry, none of them currently offers open-source software for all standards.\n\nThose interested in trying the CryptoStandard Secure Bitcoin Storage software can do so by downloading it from GitHub at the following link.\n\nRef: BitcoinTalk | GitHub | Image: BitcoinTalk Post', 'Banks have not prepared to retain control of customers and merchant payment interfaces in the face of blockchain or distributed ledger, according to managing consultant firm Bain & Company white paper.\n\nSuch technology removes intermediaries, simplifies counterparty connections and records data in a tamper-proof manner. It also promises faster speed, more transparency and efficiency for payments.\n\nBitcoin, despite some flaws, demonstrates these possibilities and has attracted a surge of investment. Ripple Labs, a blockchain startup, holds a seat on the Federal Reserve Faster Payments Task Force.\n\nBain & Company, a financial consultantcy, interviewed more than 50 venture capitalists, bankers, payment association executives, bankers and startup CEOs. The interviewees indicated that banks are positioned to address the changes caused by distributed ledgers, but the situation is complicated.\n\nThe paper attempted to clarify the different ways banks are responding to distributed ledgers and the opportunities they offer.\n\nDistributed ledgers will determine successes and failures within the banking industry, the paper noted.\n\nDistributed Ledgers Tap Existing Systems\n\nThe paper gave an overview of distributed ledger technology. It noted they combine existing technologies in novel ways. These include:\n\nThe blockchain is a secure record of transactions collected into blocks grouped in chronological order and distributed over different servers to provide reliable provenance.\n\nDigital signatures are digital keys that authorize and check transactions and identify the initiator.\n\nA consensus mechanism consists of techniques that ensure participants processing transactions agree on which ones are valid.\n\nDigital currency is, in some implementations, a cryptographic token representing value. Central banks could create digital currencies.\n\nDistributed Ledgers Vary\n\nDistributed ledgers’ features vary. Some, like bitcoin, permit any participant to validate transactions. Others, like Ripple, limit permission to a group of trusted parties.\n\nDistributed ledgers will follow two paths. One will be the development of systems focusing on global payments. The other will involve a broader disruption of domestic payments by central-bank-supported digital fiat currencies.\n\nIn the first path, financial institutions will seek opportunities for improvement, offering rewards for innovators in which no central counterparty like central banks will dominate.\n\nInternational payment services offer the most promising starting points, especially correspondent trade finance and banking. Global payments can take days to settle. They also lack transparency and often fail on account of messaging errors.\n\nDomestic payment services, by contrast, like automated clearing houses and credit cards, work well and therefore don’t have a strong need for change.\n\nDisruption Is Coming\n\nBroad disruption will eventually emerge. Signs are already emerging for the second path noted above. Central banks have already begun to consider issuing national digital currencies. If central banks make digital money available publicly rather than for internal use, it will have a big impact on domestic banking.\n\nUnder this scenario, retail banks could lose their privileged status with customers and face competition for funding and lending products. Automated clearing house and credit card industries could become obsolete.\n\nGlobal financial institutions, without a central intermediary, have created a workaround for customers. Banks have correspondent or bilateral relationships with each other, settling transactions directly. Should two banks not have a direct relationship, they tap other banks as intermediaries.\n\nDigital Ledgers’ Distinct Benefits\n\nDigital ledgers provide distinct benefits by reducing the middlemen and allowing direct transactions among counterparties. They speed transactions and ensure the participants have a complete view of customer accounts. These are the building blocks of automated payment notification and tracking.\n\nThese benefits would meet customer needs for a more holistic view of their financial positions.\n\nDigital ledgers could also cut costs and errors. Banks have to pre-fund settlement accounts. Distributed ledger transactions, by contrast, settle nearly immediately and limit liquidity costs.\n\nForeign exchange costs could also be reduced due to improved transparency on foreign exchange margins.\n\nExisting System Is Entrenched\n\nThe existing market structure gives existing players incentive to preserve the status quo. An estimated $300 trillion in transactions move through global correspondent banking networks yearly, delivering $150 billion to $200 billion in bank revenues.\n\nParticipants will not join a network before it has sufficient reach, which only comes from widespread participation.\n\nRipple is the best known company addressing this challenge, having created an international payment system around a protocol and currency. Ripple has raised $40 million in capital and works with 30 banks on pilot tests of its software.\n\nWhy Banks Are Wary\n\nFinancial institutions are hesitant about distributed ledger based on concerns about the technology’s scalability, privacy issues for sensitive information, and the governance and volatility of the bridge currency.\n\nThere is nonetheless evidence companies will overcome these hurdles. Investment in bitcoin and startups indicate a rising level of interest.\n\nIn the consumer market, companies like TransferWise use existing technologies to provide improved services. Corporate customers are taking notice.\n\nExisting Systems’ Shortcomings\n\nAbout 60% of corporate treasurers are not satisfied with banks’ current payment services, according to an industry survey.\n\nBanks are appointing mid-level technology executives to industry consortia and are participating in conferences and running limited distributed ledger simulations. But this might not be a sufficient response. Without a clear strategic plan, banks risk postponing important decisions until it becomes too late to respond effectively.\n\nDigital ledgers provide a practical way for super-regional banks to compete with global transaction banks by replicating their networks at reduced costs and stronger customer offerings.\n\nWhat Banks Should Do\n\nBanks will need to select the right partners and the right number of partners. Without these, the network will not compel customers. Super regionals should build relationships with a select group of natural allies with complementary geographical coverage.\n\nThey also have to establish more complex initiatives and alliances. They can focus on specific products, such as interbank payment services, that they can develop rapidly as a way to establish confidence, momentum and experience.\n\nGlobal banks have opportunity, but they need to act. By doing nothing, they could lose to new competitors. By overcoming institutional inertia, they can leverage their scale, their IT expertise and their relationships to improve their current networks.\n\nTrade Finance Opportunities\n\nTrade finance, a smaller sector than global correspondent banking, has similar characteristics. It supports broader transaction banking relationships and has its share of frictions. Nearly half of banks’ cost for a letter of credit is due to manual document management, creating errors, expense and delays. Hence, digital ledgers offer potential improvements.\n\nTrade finance is especially suited to distributed ledger solutions since it involves commitments from unrelated parties subject to different legal regimes.\n\nDigital identification offers immediate improvements to trade finance, including better fraud improvement.\n\nDigital ledger will also speed settlement and cut costs by mechanizing messages and receipt of payment. Smart contracts will speed transaction flows.\n\nTrade finance will change more slowly than global correspondent banking. Previous efforts to develop global standards for trade finance have failed, indicating no single bank can bring enough influence to change existing behaviors.\n\nOpportunities Require Action\n\nPressures are growing on both international correspondent banking and trade finance. Banks will have to adopt new strategies.\n\nFor super regional banks, digital ledger provides a way to establish a beachhead in a market that global banks currently dominate. The super regionals have to focus on the trade corridors in which they already have a footprint. They can collaborate with logistics and shipping companies, and customs and port authorities, to solve technical issues and build credibility and experience.\n\nDomestic Payment Systems Face Disruption\n\nWhile domestic payment systems function efficiently in developed nations, there is potential for long-term disruption.\n\nCentral banks are exploring ways to issue national digital currency based on digital ledgers. The central banks are attracted to more direct control over the execution of monetary policy, improved tracking of financial payments, and automated tax collection.\n\nIf businesses and consumers could exchange electronic payments without needing an ACH system, there would be no need for current checking accounts. Banks could find themselves in competition for deposits and lending.\n\nCentral banks will proceed cautiously. Commercial banks could create their own private digital currencies.\n\nChange Is Coming\n\nWhatever the motivating factors, digital currencies will amplify trends that are already reshaping the banking industry.\n\nIn Europe, new laws are removing banks’ hold on customer data. Payment wallets from Google, Apple and other technology firms are undermining banks’ customer relationships. To address this, banks can find ways to prepare customers for short term dislocation and the eventual arrival of digital currency.\n\nBanks can accelerate investment in digital wallets and payment apps. They can reframe regulatory compliance as a source of competitive advantage. They can invest in services and startups related to securing digital identities.\n\nQuestions To Consider\n\nBanks should ask the following questions:\n\n• How prepared is the organization for digital ledgers and related technologies?\n\n• Which systems should the organization be concerned about and invest in? Which customers and peers should the organization work with, and on what terms, to develop digital ledgers?\n\n• Is the strategy to be an innovator or a fast follower? How well does the organization know the technology and its commercial implications?\n\n• What is the organization’s position on wallets? Retaining control of payment interfaces and customer identities? How robust is the plan to win the battle for customer wallets and digital identities?\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

A farmer, for example, can hedge his produce by entering into a smart contract futures agreement dependent on x price taken from the smart contract’s underlying data analytics capabilities. If the conditions are met, payment would transfer automatically and since the farmer has a physical presence there would be readily available recourse through the legal system if the produce is not transferred.\n\nInitially, however, such capabilities would probably find more use in transactions where goods or services are digital as both payment and transfer would be automatic. At scale and dependent on the nature of the agreement, such automatic activity could save billions in time and human resources,\n\nHow these new capabilities will be implemented in practice with an easy to use interface is yet to be seen, but the hackethon provides an opportunity for anyone who wants to try these and countless of other potential uses of data driven smart contracts.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Moody's Investors Service (MIS) recently released a detailed report that names 120 blockchain projects being explored by various companies. The bond credit rating business then offers 25 top use cases for blockchain technology.\n\nThe report, “Credit Strategy -- Blockchain Technology: Robust, Cost-effective Applications Key to Unlocking Blockchain's Potential Credit Benefits,” explores how blockchain tech potentially can improve record-keeping and transactional efficiencies across many different processes and industries.\n\nA prime example is capital markets, where the technology could be used to eliminate the need for reconciling separate ledgers, synchronizing all transactions into one blockchain. The report also states that widespread adoption is still not here.\n\nMoody’s Corporation (NYSE: MCO) is the parent company of MIS. Moody’s opearates in two reportable segments: MIS and Moody’s Analytics (MA).\n\nWhile MIS publishes credit ratings on debt obligations, and the entities that issue them, MA develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities.\n\nWith a presence in 36 countries and approximately 10,800 employees, the corporation reported revenue of $3.48 billion in 2015.

The firm's ratings and analysis cover more than 120 countries, approximately 11,000 corporate issuers, 20,000 public finance issuers, and 68,000 structured finance obligations, according to the 2015 annual report. The company reported that Moody’s research website was accessed by over 259,000 individuals including 34,000 client users.\n\nMIS has been consistently ranked as the top US credit rating agency.

AsiaMoney’s Fixed Income Poll named it “#1 Asia Credit Rating Agency” for the fourth year in a row too.\n\n- Henry A. McKinnell, Jr. Moody's Chairman of the Board\n\nUse cases for bitcoin’s technology have been compiled into lists for several years by various bloggers, forum posters, and technology journalists trying to make sense of bitcoin’s future.\n\nAn early example is probably the largest in terms of use case suggestions. Compiled in March 2014 by Ledra Capital, the “mega master blockchain list” started as an informal, twitter-sourced listing of mostly theoretical use cases for blockchain technology. The list was closed after 84 use cases for blockchains, spread over seven broad categories.\n\nIn June 2015, megabank Santander’s venture capital arm, Santander InnoVentures, claimed to have internally identified 20-25 use cases for blockchain technology, all related to banking and finance. Unfortunately, the researchers did not publish their findings.\n\nDeutsche Bank has also been looking at blockchain the technology, for more than two years. While the technology has been explored in payments markets the most, Edward Budd, Managing Director of Global Transaction Banking at Deutsche Bank, sees more potential for it in securities.\n\n“When you look at blockchain use cases in the already highly efficient and lean wholesale payments market,” Budd pointed out in January, “the question is why the market should invest to move to a blockchain based solution? We see more potential for blockchain in the securities world.”\n\n- Edward Budd, Managing Director of Global Transaction Banking at Deutsche Bank\n\nMany institutions have done similar blockchain research, concluding that blockchain technology will initially be applied in capital markets. In the long run, they tend to agree with Ledra’s mega master blockchain list, there may be far more uses outside of finance.\n\nIT consulting and outsourcing firm Cognizant released a whitepaper in April, “Blockchain in Banking: A Measured Approach.” The paper listed six financial and thirteen non-financial uses for blockchains. All 19 examples were being attempted by a named company.\n\nThe 25 use cases in the recent Moody’s report also includes a variety of implementations. Each has several paragraphs defining them, listing companies working on them, and some history of each example.\n\n- Robard Williams, Moody's Senior Vice President\n\nObvious examples like international payments and real estate made the list, each with a history of the companies pushing them forward. Other, less obvious uses are offered too, like tax records, energy credits, and healthcare records.\n\nThe report also identifies four general approaches to blockchain tech development, which it says may or may not be combined in practice. “Investments in blockchain-focused start-ups,” “Partnerships with blockchain-focused start-ups,” “Internal projects with or without support from blockchain-focused consultancy and technology firms,” and “Industry collaborations among a group of corporations and/or the official sector.” All of the 120 companies they name fit neatly into one of those four types, and all are growing, according to the report."", ""Un homme identifié comme étant derrière une pyramide de Ponzi sur des opérations avec des bitcoins Est condamné à 18 mois de prison Trendon T.

Il avait certifié que les bitcoins investis par BCS&T seraient utilisés pour supporter une stratégie d\x92arbitrage du marché du Bitcoin, laquelle comprenait le prêt de bitcoins sur une période bien définie, le commerce de bitcoins via des échanges en ligne, mais également la vente de bitcoins via des transactions privées.Un discours qui n\x92a pas manqué de séduire les investisseurs qui voyaient là une opportunité de collecter des intérêts hebdomadaires. La Cour indique que BCS&T a reçu 146 000 bitcoins pour des besoins d\x92investissements, ce qui représentait une valeur de 807 380 dollars (5,5 dollars le bitcoin) à l\x92époque, mais plus de 95 millions de dollars à l\x92heure actuelle (655,95 dollars le bitcoin, soit 599,86 euros).Si Shavers a personnellement garanti de couvrir toutes les pertes dans la perspective d\x92un changement survenu dans le marché, la Cour note que BCS&T n\x92était au final qu\x92une pyramide de Ponzi dans laquelle Shavers a utilisé des bitcoins de nouveaux investisseurs pour effectuer des paiements présumés d\x92intérêts et couvrir les retraits des investisseurs de BCS&T. La Cour note également que Shavers a détourné les bitcoins des investisseurs vers son compte personnel et a changé des bitcoins en dollars américains pour payer ses dépenses personnelles. « Au sommet de ce système de Ponzi, Shavers a développé, et avait en sa possession, près de sept pour cent des bitcoins qui étaient en circulation publique à cette époque », a indiqué la Cour.Preet Bharara, procureur du district sud de New York, a avancé que ce cas illustre comment les nouvelles technologies peuvent être utilisées pour perpétrer des activités qui sont déjà illégales sous les lois existantes : « se servant d\x92une fraude séculaire en y apportant une touche de modernité, Trendon Shavers a utilisé une entreprise de bitcoins pour lancer un système classique de Ponzi. Shavers a recueilli de l\x92argent sous la forme de bitcoins en promettant des rendements spectaculaires et en apportant des garanties personnelles, alors que ce qu\x92il faisait c\x92est rembourser les anciens investisseurs avec les bitcoins des nouveaux investisseurs ».Shavers a été condamné à 18 mois de prison et 3 ans de liberté surveillée. En plus de la peine d\x92emprisonnement, le juge Kaplan l'a sommé de verser 1 228 660 dollars en dommages et 1 228 660 dollars en intérêts.Le 18 septembre 2014, dans une autre action civile, la Cour de district Est du Texas l\x92a condamné à payer plus de 40 millions de dollars en dommages et intérêts ainsi qu\x92une pénalité civile de 150 000 dollars concernant BCS&T.Source :\n\n\n\nVous avez aimé cette actualité ?

El famoso Brexit no sólo pilló a contrapié a los europeos, sino también a los mercados, lo que generó una situación de pánico bursátil.\n\nLa volatilidad se disparó y los inversores huyeron en dirección a aquello que nunca les falla. Y es que ante una situación bursátil complicada, materias como el oro, el níquel, el café o el azúcar se convierten en valores refugio donde va a parar mucho capital cuando hay problemas en la renta variable.\n\nDentro de esos valores, los gestores de fondos y los agentes de inversión apostaron por activos como los bonos alemanes y norteamericanos, el oro y la liquidez, es decir, mantener el dinero en tesorería esperando que vuelva la confianza. Dicho de otro modo, debajo del colchón. Es lo que se conoce en el argot financiero como la estrategia de inversión fly to quality, que se produce cuando existe mucha incertidumbre en el mercado.\n\nPero a todos ellos se les unió el pasado 23 de junio un nuevo jugador que, utilizando un símil futbolístico, sorprendió a propios y extraños al jugar de tú a tú a los grandes en su primera convocatoria importante. El bitcoin, hasta entonces menospreciado por unos y otros se convirtió, por primera vez, en un activo refugio y se comportó de forma similar a la que lo hicieron el oro o los ya citados bonos.\n\nPero, ¿qué es BitCoin? La respuesta es, a priori, sencilla: se trata de una moneda virtual que nos permite hacer pagos a través de la red. Pero, ¿cómo funciona? Ahí es donde empieza a complicarse la cosa. BitCoin opera con un código electrónico y es independiente de los bancos centrales y cualquier tipo de normativa internacional.\n\nOtra de las caracrerísticas de BitCoin es que las transacciones se realizan de usuario a usuario, sin que haya intermediarios de por medio. Además, a través de las casas de cambio podemos intercambiar BitCoin y obtener otras divisas con ellos.\n\nLas transacciones y operaciones realizadas con BitCoin son públicas y pueden comprobarse en el registro de libre acceso en el que están almacenadas, pero eso sí, resulta imposible conocer la identidad de los propietarios, un hecho que sus detractores han aprovechado para acusar a la criptomoneda de mecanismo de blanqueo de narcotráfico y diversas actividades ilegales.\n\nNo obstante, parece que los inversores, a la hora de la verdad, han dado su aprobación a la moneda virtual, pues en medio de la tormenta financiera que fue la mañana en la que se conocieron los resultados definitivos del referéndum decidieron confiarle su capital a este activo aún mirado con recelo llamado BitCoin.']"
07/24/2016,"['Ethereum Classic is, in my view, a total and absolute scam by any traditional financial definition of the word ""scam.""\n\nIt doesn\'t have the support of the Ethereum developers, nor of Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, making it vaporware and an altcoin created in protest of Ethereum\'s hard fork decision.\n\nNow is it valid to ""protest"" the Ethereum community\'s hard fork in such a way? Even after a month of open, intensive, exhaustive community debate about whether or not to fork?\n\nI\'d argue that any protest where the aim is to increase exposure and buys of a protest altcoin that enriches the promoters is, inherently, very dubious.\n\nBut at a core level, it\'s just completely absurd as I outline in today\'s live crypto videocast below, which incidentally broke my personal record for most number of concurrent live viewers. I\'m thirty; about time I start breaking some personal records, dammit.\n\nAlso, the fact that ""Ethereum Classic"" (in no way Ethereum, in no way Classic as Ethereum itself is not even a year old) is being tirelessly promoted by Bitcoin\'s most vocal Ethereum detractors leads me to believe one thing:\n\nBitcoin is not doing well.\n\nAfter its recent reward halving, miners get only 50% of what they were previously rewarded per block, yet the price per bitcoin has not skyrocketed in response - so now miners are subsidizing losses, in many cases. Those economics cannot last forever. As more miners drop off the network, network security decreases, making Bitcoin fundamentally less secure as a record of all prior transactions on the network.\n\nBetween Coinbase\'s blowout acceptance of Ether earlier last week, and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam\'s explanation of why Ethereum was added as a fledgling ""first class citizen"" to Coinbase\'s platform, it all becomes clear.\n\nThe trolls and narrowminded Bitcoin bagholders pushing Ethereum ""Classic"" on an unsuspecting public are not the ultimate reason I\'m selling off much of my Bitcoin tonight - that\'s just another indication to me that Bitcoin is in a weak position.\n\nUltimately, however, my decision is grounded in economic self-interest. I see optimism and amazing ideas being built out in Ethereum, and I don\'t see anything close to this level in Bitcoin at the moment.\n\nShortly after I file this story, I\'ll be selling off 80% of my personal Bitcoin holdings; or more accurately, converting them into Ether, on Coinbase.\n\nFor record\'s sake, I\'m making this conversion while Bitcoin is approximately US $661.28 and Ether is US $12.75.\n\nWatch today\'s in-depth Ethereum Classic scam bust:', 'Many people jump into Bitcoin for its investment value. Like my Mom, for example. She seemed to ignore the 2 years of work I’ve put into the Bitcoin community, but when some mainstream media talking head said Bitcoin was a good investment she demanded I return to Brooklyn to get her waist deep into the digital currency, ASAP. That’s fine and dandy and is probably the number one reason why the mainstream will notice and begin investing in Bitcoin going forward. When my Mom is on board, you’re doing something right.\n\nBitcoin’s continuously price is but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to reasons to invest in “The Future of Money.” However, since that is the case, here are five great reasons why Bitcoin’s price will continue to rise in the future, and draw continue to draw novice investors from the mainstream to the world of digital currency. If you are a regular CoinTelegraph reader, you may know some or all of these, but a refresher in the summer isn’t a bad idea. If this helps one person see the Bitcoin’s shine through this piece, my job is done.\n\n1. Bitcoin value increases over time by design\n\nWith Bitcoin’s transactional volume increasing worldwide every day, a cap on production in the future, and a reduction in Bitcoins produced every 10 minutes just implemented July 10th, Bitcoin values will continue to climb for the foreseeable future.\n\nU.S. Dollars and pretty much any fiat (paper) currency you can think of are losing value every year due to inflation, which is the increase of supply of said currency. Bitcoin is deflationary, by design. Bitcoin supply falls from now on, in four-year increments known as Bitcoin “halvings,” reducing the number of Bitcoins produced every ten minutes. Right now, this is 12.5 BTC per block.\n\nA dollar has no production limit on the amount it can be inflated by decree of government or the centralized banking syndicate. Paper currency is generally inflated to try to outspend debts, or pay for unholy wars. So no debt, no inflation, and no blood on Bitcoin’s hands. I’d say we’re off to a good ideological start…..\n\n2. Fiat currency fatigue\n\nWith global access to the Internet, and so many recent economic collapses of paper currency (Greece, Cyprus, Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, and more on the horizon), there is more interest than ever in a flat-out better economic system that is not so prone to failure after failure.\n\nMexico and Ecuador have been in discussions to mimic the Bitcoin blockchain and create their own digital currencies. China has had these discussions with Citibank and Deloitte to do the same. Tunisia, a North African nation, has already started its own national economic blockchain, and Japan has accepted Bitcoin as a national currency, on par with the Yen itself.\n\n3. Wall Street/Big Business hasn’t jumped onto the Bitcoin bandwagon…..yet\n\nBlockchain technology has been the darling of Wall Street, not Bitcoin. This is not without some good reason. Bitcoin has been embroiled in scandals and regulatory purgatory in many global locales, so it can be seen as a financial wild card to place big bets with.\n\nPayPal has caressed the exterior of the Bitcoin concept, but it still is not a part of their core business. Microsoft and Dell are the other major players, but until a mass adoption event happens, or is forced to happen by some greater economic meltdown, Bitcoin will be seen as an outlier, not the best bet.\n\n4. Cash is leaving the scene and will be replaced by digital payments anyway\n\nNations around the world are funneling the mainstream into the digital payment system and away from cash through soft bans. They may be doing it for economic control over all transactions, and the ability to record and tax every transaction in the future, but consumers will get closer and closer to the realization that Bitcoin is really their digital currency of choice.\n\nBitcoin has not gone viral yet, and is still developing the apps, upgrades, and protocols that will make it truly ready for prime time, so the upside potential is still huge. We’ve only scratched the surface of what a Bitcoin is really worth to the world. It’s quite a bit more than $670, or at least it will be in the future. Five year’s ago, it was worth $0.30 USD cents.\n\n5. The Global Reserve Currency keeps losing value, which inflates Bitcoin value\n\nAs the U.S. Dollar keeps accelerating its inflation through ‘QE Infinity,’ which increases supply and erodes its value every year, global interest in it continues to wane, and a Bitcoin will cost more and more to buy on the weakening dollar. China has already begun to call for a new global reserve currency.\n\nAs the dollar loses 5-10% a year in real value, not the government’s alleged 1-2% per annum, Bitcoin’s value in dollars will grow in proportion. When, not if, the dollar loses its “Global Reserve Currency” status, people will flood the Bitcoin market looking to get in.\n\nSince Bitcoin is not beholden to any country or economic paradigm run by the banking system, it can sit on the sidelines and collect value, like Gold and Silver will, while the legacy financial system continues to burn down around them. ‘Digital Gold’ has treated Bitcoin owners very, very well over the years, making incredible returns in six out the last seven years.\n\nI wouldn’t worry about Bitcoin values going forward. More and more talking heads in the mainstream, if they have any credibility, will be singing the praises of Bitcoin’s value proposition. Maybe even some of them will be speaking from experience?\n\nThe real question is, will you? Not if you don’t see the forest through the trees and get started.

In addition, the 200 SMA appears to have held as a dynamic resistance zone, keeping gains in check.\n\nStochastic is already indicating overbought conditions and is turning lower, which means that buyers are exhausted and that sellers are ready to regain control. A bit of bearish divergence can be seen, as price formed lower highs since July 22 while stochastic had higher highs since then.\n\nIf the selloff resumes, bitcoin price could revisit the channel lows at $645-650 while a break past the resistance could allow the uptrend to return, taking price up to area of interest at $670.\n\nMarket Events\n\nCentral bank events could provide volatility for bitcoin price action this week. In particular, the FOMC statement could determine dollar trends, even though no actual interest rate hikes are expected for now. Still, the Fed’s bias for the rest of the year could determine whether or not the US currency could continue to advance.\n\nThe US advanced GDP reading for the second quarter is also up for release this week, with analysts expecting stronger growth for the period compared to the first quarter of 2016. In that case, the US dollar could draw stronger demand compared to other assets, buoyed by stock market gains as well.\n\nThe Bank of Japan is also set to announce its monetary policy decision this week and an easing announcement could spur gains for bitcoin price if traders anticipate more uncertainty in global markets.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Peter Kelly-Detwiler, co-founder of NorthBridge Energy Partners, LLC, a consulting firm that helps companies connect assets to power grids, examined the impact that expanding cryptocurrency is having on energy consumption in a recent Forbes article. He raises the possibility power supply could constrain bitcoin’s growth.\n\nKelly-Detwiler noted that while cryptocurrencies are ethereal, they depend on a very real support in electricity. He noted hundreds of megawatts of electricity are used to produce bitcoin, although there are few estimates available on the exact amount.\n\nMiners Are Elusive\n\nOne reason the exact amount of electricity used to power bitcoin is uncertain is that the miners that produce bitcoin maintain a low profile. Bitcoin mining centers are big datacenters that are dispersed globally. The datacenters are clustered in places with cheap electricity.\n\nChina has the largest number of datacenter mines. The largest share of Chinese mines are close to Tibet in an area with abundant, cheap hydropower. Datacenter mines also exist in Iceland, Malaysia, Venezuela, the Republic of Georgia and other countries.\n\nElectricity can comprise 90% to 95% of mining costs, Kelly-Detwiler noted. He compared energy and computers to fuel and bulldozers that claw away at hillsides for gold. The computers have specialized chips designed to solve math problems using open source software.\n\nHow Mining Consumes Power\n\nCryptocurrency mining is complex, Kelly-Detwiler observed. A miner can create currency by solving math problems that seal off transaction blocks in the publicly visible bitcoin blockchain ledger. If a miner solves a problem, they are awarded bitcoins.\n\nEvery 10 minutes, bitcoin transactions (of which 150,000 to 250,000 occur daily) become locked and filed into a single block in the blockchain. Computers compete to gain credit for sealing off the latest block in the chain.\n\nTo gain this credit, miners must make millions of attempts to create the hash with the required characteristics to solve the problem. Hence, speed is critical to solving the problem. Special computers can run in the “tera-hash” range, a trillion inputs per second.\n\nThe more miners involved in the process, the greater the level of difficulty required to win credit for sealing off the latest block in the chain. This increasing level of difficulty is by design in order to slow the bitcoin creation process. The increasing difficulty builds the need for faster machines that consume more electricity.\n\nThe Bitcoin Supernetwork\n\nReuters reported that the bitcoin computer network is estimated to be 43,000 times more powerful than the top 500 supercomputers in the world combined.\n\nEstimates indicate that by 2020, bitcoin mining could consume 14,000 megawatts of electricity, comparable to half of New England’s generating capacity or all of Denmark’s consumption.\n\nThe seignorage, the difference between money’s face value and the cost to produce it, could become minimal or negative, challenging the currency’s viability. The marginal power costs could outstrip the newly-minted bitcoin’s value.\n\nThe 14,000 megawatts is a worst-case estimate based on the existing technologies. The same source noted that 417 megawatts would be possible if better equipment replaced existing machines. This indicates one bitcoin would need 5,500-kilowatt hours, comparable to half the yearly electric consumption of an average U.S. household.\n\nMining Power Estimate: 600 Megawatts\n\nA senior executive at a mining firm who did not want to be named estimated global bitcoin mining power at 600 megawatts. This is based on the number of calculations being performed and the average energy efficiency involved. That number is constantly improving.\n\nThe question naturally arises: could electrical supply constrain bitcoin’s growth?\n\nNew mining chips are expected to be three times faster than current ones, according to one executive. In addition, tight industry margins will draw attention to energy efficiency.\n\nThe bitcoin executive estimated the industry spends $250 million yearly on electricity. Added to capital costs, the annual cost to operate the network is between $400 million and $500 million. Compared to around $525 million in yearly revenue (1.4 million bitcoins released at an average price of $375), the margins are not high. Hence, continued growth is not likely without better efficiency.\n\nAlso read: BTC mining proof of work costs: large, wasteful but fair\n\nBitcoin Is Here To Stay\n\nNevertheless, the efficiencies of bitcoin bode well for its future viability, Kelly-Detwiler noted. The cumulative value of bitcoin transactions in 2015 was slightly above $60 billion at a system network cost of half a billion dollars\n\nPayPal, by contrast, reported $2 billion in expenses for 1.4 billion transactions totaling $81 billion in payments. Bitcoin is more efficient when considering the value of payments against costs. The comparison is not perfect, Kelly-Detwiler noted, but it highlights bitcoin’s inherent efficiencies.\n\nKelly-Detwiler did not answer the question of whether energy supply will constrain bitcoin’s growth, but he noted it is a trend that merits observation.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Blockchains have attracted significant interest in the financial sector, a rare occurrence for a new technology in an industry not known for being at the forefront of technological innovation.\n\nHowever, dig a little deeper into where the interest is coming from, and you’ll see a host of sell-side financial institutions and back-office groups working on prototypes. Most of the R3 consortium members, for example, are sell-side banks. Notably absent is the buy-side, made up of pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity and other money management firms.\n\nThe buy-side has different structures and mandates, but at the end of the day, investor risk-adjusted returns are a primary concern, and the blockchain can help with that.\n\nThe back-office is interested in blockchains because of the ability to simplify settlements, and provide reconciliation of data among different parties without explicitly moving and verifying data across organizational borders. This saves a check on data validity at each entry and exit point, as a consensus mechanism is accessed collectively by a group of participants.\n\nBut while interest from the buy-side has been generally muted, it would be a mistake for these firms to ignore blockchains.\n\nCost reductions\n\nThe obvious win for the buy-side is the possible efficiency gains that could be achieved by using a blockchain-based solution at the back-office for custody and settlement.\n\nAsset custodians charge a few basis points for assets held by clients, which can quickly add up. By improving efficiency, the total cost of servicing assets by a buy-side firm should fall.\n\nThe other longer term benefit could be regulatory costs.\n\nBuy-side firms today spend a significant amount of money on compliance and following regulations. Markets that adopt the blockchain could potentially encode a lot of these rules into the blockchain as smart contracts, thus reducing the need for human intervention and oversight.\n\nThe CFTC is especially interested in such efficiencies for the futures markets. Such moves would arguably make the markets safer for investors, while providing better market transparency.\n\nAccess to different markets\n\nThe benefits of global diversification on enhanced risk-adjusted returns are well known in the industry.\n\nHowever, many fund managers and buy-side firms struggle to invest in a truly globally diversified portfolio because of friction in managing the process. Global ETFs solve the problem to some extent, but managers looking at specific securities have a hard time investing economically.\n\nThe current model of global custodians and expensive asset custody fees could be a thing of the past if blockchains are widely adopted on a global scale. Such a move would benefit smaller investors the most, but would make the process of cross-border investments much simpler for all buy-side firms.\n\nThere is little manual intervention required in such a system – issues like corporate actions, for example, could one day be automated in smart contracts, removing financial intermediaries.\n\n'Digital Assets'\n\nOne of the more exciting trends in the blockchain space is around the use of public blockchains not as a settlement layer, but simply as both asset and settlement layer. Bitcoin was created as a peer-to-peer electronic currency system, but is also being used as an asset.\n\nLarge market players like the CME Group already see promise in this area. Further, investment manager Ark Invest and blockchain startup Coinbase published a recent report arguing the same.\n\nDigital assets provide a whole new investment class to the buy-side, with potential to improve risk-adjusted returns for existing portfolios. Some companies are already taking the lead on this.\n\nHedgeable, a robo-adviser based in New York, has been advising clients to invest money in bitcoin as an asset class. Last year, the average bitcoin return at the firm was over 60%, contributing 0.96% of the yearly returns, even though bitcoin made up less than 2% of the firm assets.\n\nMatthew Kane, the co-founder of Hedgeable, told CoinDesk that 30% of its clients have opened a bitcoin wallet through Coinbase to invest in bitcoin.\n\nThe average investor at Hedgeable owns 1 BTC. Kane further said that his company views bitcoin as a long-term asset class that helps enhance risk-adjusted returns.\n\nLooking to the future, with two bitcoin ETFs now pending approval from the SEC, it appears to be only a matter of time before bitcoin and other digital assets become available to common investors as an investment option.\n\nSideline image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

If this trend in Indonesia continues, the consumer will be the one losing out.\n\nMobile wallets are becoming a hot commodity these days, but that will not necessarily benefit the consumer. In Indonesia, for example, there are far too many different digital wallet offerings already. More and more partnerships are forged to offer new solutions, resulting in a fragmented landscape. Bitcoin remains the only unified solution that can work for everybody.\n\nOne thing the vast majority of existing digital wallets in Indonesia have in common is how they target different segments of the population. Every individual offering does its own thing, rather than creating a go-to solution for various needs. Collaboration with banks is tough, as every major bank is working on its own digital wallet solution right now.\n\nFragmented Digital Wallet Ecosystem In Indonesia\n\nWhile giving consumers ample choice is a positive thing, saturating the market is an unwelcome consequence. It does not make sense for the average person on the street to install a dozen different digital wallets for everyday expenses. Moreover, not everyone in Indonesia has access to a bank account or its services, leaving a lot of consumers cut off from these mobile platforms.\n\nCompetition is designed to spur innovation and benefit the consumer. If this trend in Indonesia continues, the consumer will be the one losing out. All people want is convenience, without having to give things a second thought. Until that can be achieved, they will flock to traditional payment methods such as cash. Unlike these digital wallets, cash is accepted just about anywhere and does not require a second thought to be used.\n\nThere is one solution that can connect merchants and consumers in the form of a digital wallet, though. Unlike bank-controlled platforms and currency issued by central authorities, Bitcoin is a prime example of how a global ecosystem can be created. However, adoption hinges on participation by both merchants and consumers alike.\n\nPart of the reason why Bitcoin is not a mainstream currency yet is due to these existing players trying to do their own thing. To the everyday person, Uber designing its own digital wallet makes more sense than Bitcoin. That is only to be expected, even though bitcoin is the better choice for those who want financial freedom and use one payment method all over the world with no limitations or high fees.\n\nSource: Tech In Asia\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'The big question is whether or not this software can do the things it claims to do.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about Bitcoin and whether or not it is anonymous. Cryptocurrency experts will gladly point out Bitcoin is not anonymous, but rather pseudonymous. For those people interest in de-anonymizing cryptocurrency, however, BitCluster is a solution looking into. This tool has now been open sourced, and users can download the kit, as well as the database, from the website right now.\n\nExplaining what BitCluster does it not overly difficult, as this open-source tool is designed to analyze Bitcoin transactions. Moreover, this tool can also regroup Bitcoin wallet addresses based on their incoming and outgoing transactions. All of this information is taken from the blockchain, which is available to the public in real-time.\n\nShould BitCluster Be Trusted?\n\nHowever, there is a twist to this tool, as BitCluster allows for ‘more accurate mapping of entities online activities”. To put this into simpler terms, this tool lets people see patterns between Bitcoin users based on their wallet addresses. That is, assuming one finds out which Bitcoin address belongs to a specific user, which is not always an easy task.\n\nThat being said, many Bitcoin users leave some of their addresses in the open. Members of the Bitcointalk forums often display their Bitcoin address, either on the profile or in their signature. This can give people who use BitCluster some viable information as to how these users behave. Then again, that is still a far cry from de-anonymizing anything.\n\nThe big question is whether or not this software can do the things it claims to do. Users who filter money through mixing and CoinJoin services may be able to hide their tracks. Then again, not every mixing service is set up properly, and the end user may make some mistake allowing for information to be discovered by BitCluster.\n\nBitcoin Has Never Been Anonymous\n\nAt the same time, the way this tool is advertised will lead to even more misconceptions about Bitcoin. This popular cryptocurrency has never been anonymous, and it does not protect user privacy all that well either. Just because there is no name or address recorded during every transaction does not make Bitcoin anonymous by any means.\n\nBut the biggest concern is auditing the BitCluster code. Even though everything has been open-sourced, a thorough audit by multiple experts will be needed to verify how this technology works exactly.

07/25/2016,"['A Miami-Dade judge ruled Monday that Bitcoin is not actually money, a decision hailed by proponents of the virtual currency that has become popular across the world.\n\nIn a case closely watched in financial and tech circles, the judge threw out the felony charges against website designer Michell Espinoza, who had been charged with illegally transmitting and laundering $1,500 worth of Bitcoins. He sold them to undercover detectives who told him they wanted to use the money to buy stolen credit-card numbers.\n\nBut Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler ruled that Bitcoin was not backed by any government or bank, and was not “tangible wealth” and “cannot be hidden under a mattress like cash and gold bars.”\n\n“The court is not an expert in economics; however, it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, the Bitcoin has a long way to go before it the equivalent of money,” Pooler wrote in an eight-page order.\n\nNever miss a local story.

SUBSCRIBE NOW\n\nThe judge also wrote that Florida law — which says someone can be charged with money laundering if they engage in a financial transaction that will “promote” illegal activity — is way too vague to apply to Bitcoin.\n\n“This court is unwilling to punish a man for selling his property to another, when his actions fall under a statute that is so vaguely written that even legal professionals have difficulty finding a singular meaning,” she wrote.\n\nThe ruling was lauded by Bitcoin experts who believe the ruling will encourage the use of the virtual currency, and offer a roadmap to governments across the world that have struggled to understand and regulate it.\n\nEspinoza’s attorney, Rene Palomino, said the judge’s order was “beautifully written.”\n\n“At least it gives the Bitcoin community some guidance that what my client did was not illegal,” Palomino said. “What he basically did was sell his own personal property. Michell Espinoza did not violate the law, plain and simple.”\n\nA spokesman for the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office said: “We are presently reviewing the court order to determine whether we will be appealing this decision.”\n\nLaw enforcement has struggled to figure out how Bitcoin fits into illegal activities, and Espinoza’s case was believed to be the first money-laundering prosecution involving the virtual currency.\n\nThe controversial virtual currency allows some users to spend money anonymously and it can be also be bought and sold on exchanges with U.S. dollars and other currencies.\n\nThe currency has gained popularity with merchants selling legitimate goods and services. In Miami, there are a few restaurants that accept the virtual currency — and even a plastic surgeon.\n\nRegulated services such as CoinBase, which operates similarly to PayPal, allow people to buy, sell and use the Bitcoins. But authorities have raised concerns about the currency being used in the anonymous black market.\n\nMost notoriously, Bitcoins were used to traffic drugs in the now-shuttered Silk Road network. In an unrelated South Florida case, a Miramar man got 10 years in prison after using Bitcoins to buy Chinese-made synthetic heroin from a Canadian prisoner.\n\nIn Espinoza’s case, Miami Beach detectives found him through a Bitcoin exchange site, LocalBitcoins.com, and told him they were going to use the currency to purchase stolen credit-card numbers.\n\nThe detectives met with Espinoza, 32, three times in person: on Lincoln Road, at an ice cream shop and in a hotel room.\n\nEspinoza was arrested along with another man, Pascal Reid, who pleaded guilty to acting as an unlicensed money broker and was sentenced to probation. Under his unusual plea deal, he agreed to teach law enforcement about Bitcoin.\n\nAt a hearing in May, a defense expert, Barry University economics professor Charles Evans, testified that Bitcoin was not actually money.\n\nNo central government or bank backs Bitcoin, like the United States does the dollar. Government regulation of Bitcoin remains a messy hodgepodge from state to state, country to country. The IRS considers Bitcoin deals no more than bartering, he said.\n\n“Basically, it’s poker chips that people are willing to buy from you,” said Evans, a virtual-currency expert who was paid $3,000 in Bitcoins for his defense testimony.\n\nThe judge’s decision will help Bitcoin flourish in Miami and countries where banking system are tenuous, Evans said in an interview on Monday.\n\n“Bitcoin is perfect for small-scale cross-border transactions and we are international in this area,” Evans said. “If somebody from Venezuela needs a hammer, now that person can send Bitcoin to his cousin in Miami, that cousin can sell the Bitcoin, go buy the hammer and send it to Venezuela.”\n\nThe ruling could also spark a push to tweak Florida law. Judge Pooler, in her ruling, said the state’s money-laundering law that targets transactions that “promote” illegal activity requires a “much-needed update.”\n\n“Hopefully, the Florida Legislature or an appellate court will define ‘promote’ so individuals who believe their conduct is legal are not arrested,” Pooler wrote.', 'Analytics provided by BBA\n\nDespite a somewhat more bullish outlook in last week’s report, once again the market could not get sustainably above the key $680 resistance level (or below the critical 640 $ support level). We remain patient and neutral on the market for the time being.\n\nAll is quiet on the western front of bitcoinland from both a fundamental and technical perspective, hence why we remain in a range-bound market, however the same cannot be said for Ethereum. Late last week, the Ethereum project forked their blockchain in order to undo the damage caused by the DAO fiasco. While the fork was supposedly based on a consensus of miners, devs, users, service-providers, and investors, we see that this is not the case considering we now have two Ether chains running at the same time, Ethereum HF (the new and currently longer chain) and Ethereum Classic which is the old, unadulterated chain. This fascinating development is very revealing for the field of crypto-economics, and is a relevant cautionary tale for those parties that have been pushing for a bitcoin hard fork for past few years.\n\nRegardless of how the Ethereum drama plays out as the new and old chains compete with one another for hashing power and investment capital (Ether Classic is now a separate coin that can be traded on exchanges such as Poloniex), all bitcoin can do is watch and learn. If nothing else, this controversy has highlighted that the crypto “reserve currency” status that bitcoin holds is both warranted and valuable, and sets the stage for the upside resolution we have been looking for, albeit we may be waiting for another month or two for the breakout.\n\nSo, with all of that in mind let’s take a look at the daily chart once again to see how the consolidation is playing out. We can see that there still hasn’t been much movement at all following the break of what appeared to be a bullish pennant. Apparently the market was not ready to move in either direction, which means that we are likely in for more choppy, range-bound action. It also implies a continuation of our “buy the dips, sell the rips mentality” within the current $640 – 680 trading range. Having said that, we can see that the A/D line is still pressing to the upside while the momentum oscillators attempt to recharge, indicating that the odds remain in favor of an eventual upside breakout above $750 rather than a breakdown below $550.\n\nSeeing as though the daily chart is still inconclusive over the short to medium term, we once again turn to the lower timeframes for additional technical detail. We can see on the 6-hour chart below that we remain in the ascending triangle formation despite a break below the 200-period SMA and volume profile PoC. Neither of these are very encouraging signs over the near term, however the lack of a panicky sell-off on these breaks makes us think that the bulls are still in control. Until we get a move below the medium term uptrend line that sits around $640, also the bottom of the current trading range, or above resistance at $700 then the BTC markets will remain in consolidation mode.\n\nConversely, there are a few positive signals emerging with Willy still recharging nicely, RSI and MACD still chopping around the centerline, and the A/D line still moving to the upside. While we think the charts are telling us to remain patient yet bullishly biased as we progress through this period of market stagnation, we are also on watch for a fakeout move to the downside which acts as a catalyst (or “spring”) for the next leg to the upside to challenge $1000.\n\nGenerally speaking, as long as the $550 area can hold as support over the next month or two, the longer term bull market will remain intact.\n\nBullBear Analytics\n\nBullBear Analytics is the longest standing cryptocurrency forecasters in the market.

The spike has once again shone a light on the digital currency as a potential alternative to fiat currencies, which currently is witnessing all kinds of volatility thanks to Brexit, central banks’ thirst for printing, and massive deficit spending. While many investors see a positive future for the alternative currency, the true test of Bitcoin will be if a nation adopts the currency. The adoption of Bitcoin as a national currency will bring with it a plethora of financial securities but at the cost of eliminating the ability of central banks to print currency endlessly.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nBitcoin was born out of a desire for online payments to be conducted among peer to peer systems with the elimination of a third party or middleman such as Paypal. Since its inception, Bitcoin has evolved into a myriad of entities ranging from being an investment vehicle, digital currency, community, and more importantly, the potential to be an alternative monetary system. It’s in this last point where Bitcoin’s greatest potential lies, if the trend continues; it could forever change how people and government conduct business.\n\nIs it Money?\n\nDespite making headlines, Bitcoin is still unknown to many. A study conducted by the Coin Center has found that 2/3 of Americans have no knowledge about the digital currency and of those that did know, 80% never have used it. This is one of the major impediments for Bitcoin in its quest to become an established currency. When Bitcoins are mentioned, the primary concern for people is whether or not it is money? Many people think of it more as a credit than actual currency such as Dollars, the Euro, Rubles, etc. In order to better understand if Bitcoins are money, one must understand how money is defined. Money is primarily defined by the following characteristics:\n\nDurability – Be able to withstand wear and tear. Thanks to technology, Bitcoin as a digital unit of currency can, in theory, last into perpetuity.\n\nDivisible – Ability to divide into small units allowing consumers to purchase products at any price. Bitcoin is more divisible than any existing currency, allowing users to go into thousandths place for a transaction, if need be.\n\nScarce – Must be limited and not so easily obtained. Unlike fiat currency, which is not capped and can be printed endlessly (as it is now around the world), Bitcoin production is capped at 21 million, at which point no more will be produced. This fact alone makes Bitcoin more stable than gold which is not firmly capped and supplies remain somewhat unbounded depending on mining activity.\n\nPortable – Is it easy to carry? Due to its digital nature, Bitcoins can be carried on phones, tablets or computers anywhere and anytime.\n\nAcceptability – Must be widely accepted as a medium of exchange. This is currently one of the uphill battles for Bitcoin. It is gaining momentum globally but as a relatively new currency, it needs to continue to increase its recognition. Nevertheless, relative to many minor currencies of weaker economic nations, Bitcoins appear to be accepted more so.\n\nStability– The value of the currency must remain relatively constant over long periods of time. As a new currency with few investors, Bitcoins liquidity is more volatile due to the effect of every transaction on the digital currency’s price, but with time this issue will subside as more investors and users partake into the currency decreasing its precariousness. In addition, the upper cap of Bitcoin production will serve as an anchor for price stability due to the fact that no more can be created. In theory, this parameter would invalid many national currency, if not all. The US Dollar, perhaps one of the most trusted and strongest currencies, has lost almost 100% of its value in the last several decades.\n\nThus, by the six generally accepted measures defining a currency as money, Bitcoins appears to fit the mold.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe 2008 financial crash as well as the economic uncertainty that has followed in the past decade has caused many to begin questioning the financial systems and philosophies that govern them around the world. As a result, shifts to populist leadership have begun to take root in many countries as well as the call for overhauling their respective economic systems. The confidence crisis will not be solved by any one leader or system but rather how money is handled in these respective countries. Under the current global monetary system, established in Bretton Woods and its subsequent modifications, all the nations in the world have fiat currencies. Fiat currencies are monies that are backed by the promise of the government that issues it and nothing else. This greatly diverges from what use to be practiced where currency was anchored to some tangible commodity that had an intrinsic value such as gold and/or silver. The root cause, albeit perhaps a simplified explanation herein, of many economic crises is due to use of fiat currency. Fiat currencies are not secured to anything, thus allowing central banks to scheme for ways to “alter” its value. Their tools of choice are printing more and using the additional money created out of thin air to “eliminate” any debt and deficit spending but such free reign to produce money comes at a dire consequence; devaluation or inflation. Inflation is an indirect tax on a nation’s population. Unrestricted spending leads to massive currency printing, which eventually is paid for by the citizens through inflation that can go unchecked sometimes as history has demonstrated in Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, and now Venezuela, to cite a few extreme cases.\n\nEnter Bitcoin. The implementation of Bitcoin as a national currency will yield immense benefits for a nation over time. While many countries dread ceding financial authority of their currency, the benefits of Bitcoin implementation as national currency will outweigh the costs for all countries but especially third world nations with smaller economies. Most economies around the world ultimately operate based on the consumer’s confidence, which has been eroding ever since the 2008 financial downturn. Bitcoin remedies the issue of public trust in the economic system. With smaller nations, the adoption of Bitcoin will allow them to restore not only their public’s confidence but attract foreign investments because there is a source of stability in the country; business loves stability. No longer can a nation’s currency be devalued by social welfare, war, debt, or redistribution of wealth especially to help ensure political ambitions. But pursuing such a policy does not come without costs. A national adoption of Bitcoin renders a nation impotent when it comes to the ability to control reserves, printing additional currency, or any other type of monetary policy.\n\nSuch surrender of financial ability forces a paradigm shift for governments in how they operate. The ultimate benefit is for a nation’s citizen, government can no longer squander hard earned tax money on fruitless projects, redistribution to other segments of society in order to secure votes and influence, and send money to finance projects for corporate or foreign allies at the cost of running up the national debt with no remorse. Legislators complacent in the status quo system view the separation of currency and state as anathema to the concept of government due to the fact that it reduces their ability to carry out spending, sometimes massively, without checks. In addition, the thought of such a radical departure is only viewed as such due to the fact that nations were technologically unable to do so until now thanks to the advancement in computing as well as blockchain technology.\n\nThe adoption of Bitcoin as an official currency by any nation actually demonstrates that government’s adherence of fiduciary responsibility to its citizens. In doing so, a government handicaps itself in being able to run to the printing press and debase their currency all the while reducing citizen’s wealth through inflation. Instead, the government returns to what it should be doing, which is justify every item in a budget as well as balance it. This in itself will cause a government to become more transparent and reduce corruption greatly as well as strengthen democracy.\n\nChallenges\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge will be the ability of government to borrow. This will hamper economic growth due to the fact that government and business have become acclimated to artificial growth by the government increasing its debt holdings especially in recent decades, therefore creating economic expansion that was never wholly justified or possible without careless financial management. This shift will have a detrimental effect on citizens and nations alike.\n\nAnother downside to an adoption of Bitcoin by one or a few nations is the surrender of a powerful weapon, devaluation of currency. The continual back and forth bickering between the US, China, EU, etc. about currency devaluation is only possible when central banks control a fiat currency, once a nation surrenders that ability, they are no longer able to fight on equal footing against a fiat currency-based nation. This could have negative effects in the interim for such a nation’s industries when it comes to exporting goods. Finally, the establishment of Bitcoin will have a large effect on the concept of credit as is known in its current form. Markets will need to devise a new way for credit creation in a world absent of fiat currency and what it means to have credit.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to grow in popularity and garner more attention by investors, everyday users and even politicians, the inevitable reality of Bitcoin becoming a national currency is on the horizon. Such a currency contains the potential to prevent the financial roller coaster that is being observed in nations such as Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Yet, in the interim, early adopters will face many challenges and impediments as they transition into a Bitcoin-based monetary system but such bumps will pay off in the long term.', 'The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) of New Zealand has noted it has received complaints from New Zealand based clients of igot, an Australia-based bitcoin exchange, about igot’s failure to repay clients in accordance with their instructions.

The blog includes an image to convey the volume of incoming transactions.\n\nThe blog stated igot utilizes industry-standard DDoS protection, “but unfortunately in this case it is not effective.”\n\nThe igot team has minimized the attack’s severity, but more remains to be done. “We hope to return to a normal service very soon,” the blog noted. “Please keep an eye on our Facebook and Twitter feeds for updates as the situation changes.”\n\nThe entire bitcoin network recently suffered a similar spam attack, albeit on a larger scale, the blog noted. An overview can be seen in this blog post by BlockCypher.\n\nSimilar Situation Occurred In April\n\nIgot made the same statement about a DDoS attack in April when clients said the exchange was unable to deliver on purchases or provide refunds for months, CCN reported.\n\nNicholas Giurietto, chief executive of Australian Digital Currency and Commerce Association (ADCCA), said at the time that igot customers have been devastated.

The EU quotes the prevention of terrorist financing and money laundering for the reason behind it.\n\nThe Commission stated that virtual currency transfers, including Bitcoin, are not monitored or observed by public authorities within the EU and thus, a regulatory framework for digital currency platforms must be established.\n\n“For that purpose, obliged entities need to collect, process and record personal data, and sometimes to share such data with public authorities (such as FIUs) or with private entities within the same group,” a section of the proposal reads.\n\nIn relation to providing a regulatory framework for digital currency startups—which most likely will require all EU digital currency startups to collect private and sensitive information of their users—the EU Commission stated in Article 65 of 4AMLD that a regularly maintained central database of registered virtual currency users must be established by June 2019.\n\nThe Commission proposed:\n\n“Appropriate proposals, including, where appropriate, with respect to virtual currencies, empowerments to set up and maintain a central database registering users’ identities and wallet addresses accessible to FIUs, as well as self-declaration forms for the use of virtual currency users.”\n\nCore Problems\n\nThe EU Commission’s ambitious plan to create a centralized database of decentralized digital currency users presents two core problems: violation of personal data and their disturbingly poor quality of cyber security.\n\nEuropean government agencies, law enforcement, and non-profit organizations have been targeted by thousands of public data attacks since 2004. Amongst those attacks, the number of publicly recorded data breaches is estimated at 229, exposing the vulnerable and outdated IT systems of Europe’s government-backed agencies.\n\nThe European Union and its cyber security units, which have been long involved with the darknet and Bitcoin transactions are proposing to create a central database of personal, private, and sensitive financial records of millions of digital currency users with the illogical case that digital currency funds most of the ‘terrorist’ and illegal purchases in the world today.\n\nPerhaps it is the fault of mainstream media, but cash has been the preferred method of purchasing illegal items and terrorism financing, for one simple reason: cash is completely anonymous, while digital currencies aren’t.\n\nVirtual currencies which are based on public or shared ledgers are built to be transparent and decentralized. Thus, anyone on the network can access the data of financial transactions. The EUROPOL used this disadvantage of the Bitcoin network to track down Silk Road traders earlier in 2016.\n\nIf the basis of the EU Commission’s argument is to centralize virtual currencies to stop the illegal purchase of drugs and terrorist financing, it is more sensible for the Commission to execute the same plan on cash users, since there are more cases of drug purchases and money laundering with cash.', 'Institutional investors have become the largest group of bitcoin buyers because of the negative interest rate policy of central banks and the rising bitcoin price, according to Chris Vermeulen, founder of AlgoTrades Systems, a market technical analyst, trader and a financial author, writing in resourceinvestor.com.\n\nVermeulen claims central banks have proven to be a curse for global economies and their days are numbered because of new technologies and currencies.\n\nInvestors Escape Fiat Currencies\n\nPeople are putting money into digital currencies rather than fiat currencies due to central banks’ negative interest and zero interest rate policies. This has caused bitcoin’s price rise this year.\n\nCarlo Civelli, a billionaire resource investor, said central banks will not be able to get away with their monetary printing. The more they print, the more they drive investors away from fiat currency. Civelli said he could see governments telling people their money and bonds are worthless and that everyone has to “take a haircut.”\n\nBecause investors recognize this outcome, they are now the largest group of bitcoin buyers.\n\nJeremy Millar, who founded Ledger Partners in London, thinks family offices and hedge funds provide 50 to 80 percent of bitcoin’s $6.4 billion market capitalization.\n\nBitcoin Has Evolved\n\nMillar told Reuters that over the past two years bitcoin has emerged from its “hacktivist” origins to an institutional ecosystem including traders, professional investors and hedge funds.\n\nWhile a lack of regulation scared new customers, the Winklevoss twins gave the industry a boost with their Gemini bitcoin exchange.\n\nVermeulen pointed out that regulation did not help during the 2007 crash and it won’t help in the next crash.\n\nGemini is regulated in New York State and is regulated under banking law, so it operates under the same controls as any financial institution.

Bitcoin developers have been discussing the proposed changes for some time and describe both the motivation for the changes, and the implementation in some detail here.\n\nTo put it simply, CSV, or CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY is a new opcode for use within the Bitcoin scripting system, essentially it is an amended version of an existing opcode known as NOP3. Bitcoin scripting provides a system which enables a variety of different parameters to be required before transferred bitcoins may be spent. A typical transaction between two parties has two requirements that must be fulfilled before its output is spendable; the public key must correspond to the destination address, and match the private key signature. Bitcoin scripts can also be used to require multiple signatures before a transaction is valid, or even no signature at all!\n\nBitcoin Improvement Proposal 112 (BIP112), in conjunction with BIP 68, implements the changes which are necessary to allow time-based restrictions to be placed on the execution pathways of a script. The two BIPs outline necessary changes to the scripting system, such that an existing transaction field known as nSequence can be utilised as a time-keeping parameter. CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY is a new script execution pathway that won’t allow a transaction to be included in a block, until the newly available nSequence time parameter reaches the specified age.\n\nAs of Bitcoin Core 0.12.1, the soft fork deployment for both BIP 68 and BIP 112 has been included in the software, using the mechanism for deployment established by BIP9.\n\nThe changes will be an important step towards the realisation of a number of highly anticipated developments to the Bitcoin network. They are the changes to the fundamental Bitcoin protocol which facilitate the actualisation of a number of ideas we’ve been hearing about over the last year or so. The new scripting capabilities can be utilised to extend the idea of bi-directional pegs and will be vital in creating the network infrastructure for off-chain transactions. These such developments are purported to be the answer to increasing fees and limited block space for transactions on the main Bitcoin blockchain, as the bi-directional payment channels established will facilitate low-cost, off-chain payments whilst maintaining the security and reliability of the existing Bitcoin protocol.\n\nThe CSV Opcode adjustments were facilitated in part by the inclusion of a mechanism for straightforward Bitcoin Script Language upgrades within “Segregated Witness”. Segregated Witness embodies a series of proposed changes to the Bitcoin software, which began life as a solution to the long-standing issue of transaction malleability, and has since evolved in to a more significant collection of tweaks to the Bitcoin software with the aim of seriously improving scalability. When fully activated, SegWit will serve to provide additional block space due to the nature of changes to the underlying Bitcoin protocol. Since the original announcement of SegWit back in December, there has been a huge testing process, as the Bitcoin Core developers are understandably cautious with changes to the international Bitcoin network which is worth billions in dollars. However, the soft fork software was launched in May and is now being used on the network.\n\nOff-chain transactions and payment channels have been a popular point of interest for the Bitcoin community over the last couple of years. There has been a great deal of discussion and progress behind-the-scenes between developers and Bitcoin enterprise regarding the future of Bitcoin and the looming question of scalability. Off-chain transactions are likely to play a significant role in the future of the network, and there appears to be a growing consensus that this is the right direction for the Bitcoin ecosystem to continue to grow and handle increasing transaction volumes. The alternative means of transacting using the Bitcoin network will be a welcome development and should have the effect of driving forward further innovation using the solid basis provided by the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nUltimately, BIP68 and 112 are relatively uninteresting to the average user and the implementation is quite complex for those who aren’t already familiar with the Bitcoin scripting system. However, the future they promise to be a step towards, has exciting potential for all types of Bitcoin user.', ""Navigating the market as a sex worker isn’t easy. In the UK, the act of prostitution itself is legal, but all sorts of related pursuits that might actually help you find work – kerb crawling, offering services in a public place, or acting as an agent or brothel manager – are not.\n\nBut the rise of the internet has made available a whole new range of tools, some of which are particularly useful to sex workers trying to make a living. Oz, an Australian male escort who has worked in London for around six years, meets me for lunch to explain how he uses his phone and laptop to boost business and keep himself safe.\n\nAsk me anything (really, anything)\n\nOz has his own website, which he employed a developer to build and now maintains himself. He’s constantly trying to boost it up Google's search rankings using SEO (search engine optimisation) tricks familiar to journalists and marketing executives: linking it to his Twitter, updating the site regularly with blogposts about other escorts he offers “duos” and “trios” with, and linking to his ads on online sex work directories. Interviews like this one help, too.\n\nHe recently participated in an AMA, or “ask my anything”, thread on reddit, in which users quizzed him about his life as an escort. Users asked whether he ever has sex outside work (yes), and the weirdest requests he’s had (to kick someone repeatedly in the balls).\n\nWhy reddit? “I'm into a lot of nerdy stuff myself, science fiction and fantasy, so I lurked on the site for a long time before I did the AMA,” he tells me.\n\nBut he was also gunning for clicks: “I thought it would generate a lot of traffic, and it did – it sold a few videos, and helped my search rankings.”\n\nHell to pay\n\nTaking payment is a constant difficulty for sex workers, and as a result are most forced to take wads of cash, which they keep in their homes. “I prefer not to use bank accounts,” Oz tells me. “And you can’t really use PayPal for that kind of thing because they ban you if they think you’re doing sex work.”\n\nAdvances in blockchain technology, though, can offer a way around this, as payments are not made through a bank and aren’t traceable. “When I work for overseas clients, I get them to pay me in Bitcoin, if they can figure that out. It’s pretty alien to some of my clients – lots are middle-aged and older, and not all that tech-savvy.”\n\nSwipe right\n\nLike many other sex workers, Oz occasionally gets work from dating apps like Tinder or Grindr. “Whenever I do that, I get 100 complete time-wasters for every genuine person. So it’s quite time-consuming.” Other app users tend to know he’s an escort because he has “kind of glossy” photos, which he had taken by a photographer through a Groupon deal.\n\nI ask whether the rise of dating apps, which supposedly make casual sex easier than ever before, has affected the market for sex work, but Oz says the two scratch slightly different itches. “People who want an escort want discreetness and quality. You could have something for free or next to free at home, but people who can afford it want something special, so they're willing to pay for it.”\n\nFace unrecognition\n\nAny photos of Oz online obscure his face through blurring, which he paid someone from a crowdsourcing website to do. “I blur my face because of the progress of facial recognition and reverse image search technology,” he says. “And what it might be like in another five to ten years.”\n\nIn Russia, this is already a pressing concern: FindFace, a facial recognition app, has been used to find sex workers on social media and out them to friends and family.\n\nDouble ohh 7\n\nPerhaps most importantly, new technology is helping keep sex workers safe. The Ugly Mugs app and email alerts, used by Oz and many of his friends, circulate details of punters who didn’t pay or were violent.\n\nOz also uses the TrueCaller app, which shows you what names a phone number has been saved under in other users’ phones. The app is marketed to the general public, so you may just find they’re listed as “Bob”, but it’s also popular among sex workers who might mark “do not work with” or “time waster”.\n\nEscorts also use photo recognition (such as reverse searching an image on Google to see where it has appeared before) to check out punters’ photos. “We investigate them to see whether they are using a fake photo or are dangerous,” Oz says. “But also to see how rich they are.”\n\nWhile Oz has his digital escorting down to an art, the skillset overlaps with some very different industries. “I know a few escorts who would make quite good spies,” Oz says, “because of the skillset they picked up on the job.”"", ""Blockchain services tech company SolidX Partners, Inc., has filed paperwork with the SEC to launch an ETF that tracks the price of the digital currency, Bitcoin. According to website ETF.com, the new ETF product will be called 'SolidX Bitcoin Trust' and will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol XBTC subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nXBTC will not be the first exchange traded vehicle to track the price of Bitcoin (BTC), which is currently trading around $665 per BTC. The Winklevoss twins filed paperwork for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust back in 2013. To be traded on the BATS exchange under the ticker COIN, the Winklevoss Trust filed its sixth amendment this week to their form S-1 in preparation of exchange trading.\n\nThere is also an OTCBB issue with the ticker GBTC, The Bitcoin Investment Trust, which is administered by Grayscale Investments, LLC. Each GBTC share is meant to represent ownership of approximately 0.1 bitcoin, which is worth today $66.5, however GBTC shares are trading at around $119, nearly an 80% premium.\n\nSolidX said in its filing for XBTC that the bitcoin it will hold in its ETF will be insured. The insurance will cover the loss of bitcoin through theft, destruction or computer fraud, with Bank of New York Mellon acting as custodian. Because Bitcoin is a new type of asset, it requires a rule change filing with the SEC by the exchange that will carry it. BATS filed for that rule change for the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF on June 30, paving the way for the SolidX ETF offering, as well as the potential for many future copycats. SolidX will need NYSE and ARCA to make similar rule changes before it can be listed for trade.\n\nSolidX will begin with a much lower initial offering value for its ETF at around $1 million, compared to the much larger $65 million Winklevoss fund. If all goes according to plan, investors should see the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF receive SEC approval by the end of this year, and shortly after that, the SolidX Bitcoin ETF should get approved, allowing for active trading by early in 2017 the latest.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile over-the-counter GBTC has been trading since March of 2015 as a Bitcoin-tracking ETF, it is not regulated by the SEC and does not actually track the price of bitcoin well in the market. Two regulated ETFs are set to hit exchanges soon, with SolidX's XBTC ETF nipping at the heels of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, which has been in the works for three years.""]"
07/26/2016,"[""Oli Scarff/Getty Images\n\nThis post originally appeared on Business Insider.\n\nBitcoin isn’t money, a Florida judge has declared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCircuit Court Judge Teresa Pooler has dismissed a money laundering case brought against a website developer, ruling that “nothing in our frame of references allows us to accurately define or describe Bitcoin.”\n\nIt’s a judgment that has been cheered by advocates for the digital currency (or token, or property, or whatever you want to call it), and may set a precedent for how it is dealt with in other legal cases.\n\n(We first saw the case over at The Miami Herald, and you can read the full ruling below.)\n\nFirst, the facts. Michell Espinoza was charged with money laundering and acting as an unauthorised money transmitter after selling bitcoin to undercover cops who found him through a bitcoin-selling website, Local Bitcoins. Over a series of meetings, Espinoza sold the undercover agent $2,000-worth of bitcoin, which the agent said would be used to purchase stolen credit card numbers. Espinoza was then arrested after a bogus fourth sale was arranged for $30,000-worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut Judge Pooler, in an order signed on July 22, has thrown these charges out.\n\nShe argues that the modern regulatory and frameworks we have do not allow people to “accurately define or describe Bitcoin.” The digital currency runs in an entirely decentralised fashion, with no central bank, and can be extremely volatile.\n\n“Bitcoin may have some attributes in common with what we commonly refer to as money, but differ in many important aspects,” she wrote. “While bitcoin can be exchanged for items of value, they are not a commonly used means of exchange. They are accepted by some but not all merchants or service providers. The value of Bitcoin fluctuates wildly and has been estimated to be eighteen times greater than the U.S. dollar. Their high volatility is explained by scholars as due to their insufficient liquidity, the uncertainty of future value, and the lack of a stabilization mechanism. With such volatility they have a limited ability to act as a store of value, another important attribute of money.”\n\nMany bitcoin advocates are deeply political, viewing the technology as part of a new economic order that will ultimately disrupt traditional finance. So, on the surface of it, it’s weird that they would celebrate a ruling that says bitcoin isn’t money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut had Judge Pooler ruled the other way, it could have been disastrous for businesses who work with and around the technology. If it was money, and those buying and selling it were acting as money transmitters without licenses, it would make vast swathes of the community (theoretically) illegal overnight.\n\nInstead, the judge says it makes more sense to describe Bitcoin as property—and as such, Espinoza’s actions don’t equate to money laundering.\n\nFor example: If Tom sells Harry a car for cash, and Harry has said he intends to swap the car for drugs, that doesn't necessarily mean Tom is breaking the law, the argument goes.\n\n“This court is unwilling to punish a man for selling his property to another,” wrote Judge Pooler, “when his actions fall under a statute that is so vaguely written that even legal professionals have difficulty finding a singular meaning.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDuring the case, the defense called Barry University economics professor Charles Evans as an expert witness. He also made the case that bitcoin isn't money: “Basically, it’s poker chips that people are willing to buy from you,” he testified, according to The Miami Herald.\n\nFor his time, Prof. Evans was paid $3,000—in bitcoin."", 'Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin issued new statements today reiterating that the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit founded to support development work on the ethereum protocol, will support the version of the ethereum blockchain that includes a hard fork meant to enable investors to recover funds lost in the collapse of The DAO.\n\nFounded in June 2014, the Swiss organization (formally called Stiftung Ethereum) has been largely quiet over the last month as the community sought to move forward from the collapse of The DAO, which for a brief time was the platform’s most prominent project, holding at one time $160m in investor capital denominated in ether, ethereum\'s cryptocurrency.\n\nMost immediately, the statements quell uncertainty about whether the Ethereum Foundation would support both the primary ethereum blockchain, as well as Ethereum Classic, a version being maintained with the original transaction history.\n\nOverall, the organization has elected to stand by the informal community voting that lead to the hard fork, executed roughly one week ago, while indicating it would not seek to hinder progress on any alternative ethereum projects, such as Ethereum Classic.\n\nButerin wrote:\n\n""We recognize that the ethereum code can be used to instantiate other blockchains with the same consensus rules, including testnets, consortium and private chains, clones and spin-offs, and have never been opposed to such instantiations.""\n\nButerin used the remainder of the announcement to discuss how technical users could ensure clients were formatted for use with their desired version of the ethereum blockchain.\n\nFurther, Buterin encouraged the Ethereum Classic team to execute an additional hard fork that would guard its blockchain from ‘replay attacks’ by moving classic ethers, or the currency units on the alternative blockchain, to new accounts.\n\nAt press time, reaction to the post was mixed, with users largely split over ideological lines that mirrored the larger debate across the ecosystem in recent days.\n\nFor example, on reddit, some praised the new clarity from the foundation. Others, by contrast, sought to reiterate support for Ethereum Classic as an implementation of the protocol that best represents the values of the ethereum project as a whole.\n\nImage via ethereum\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

For the moment, the platform won\'t allow Australians to sell digital currency, just buy it.\n\nFounded in 2012, the Coinbase app and site supports digital wallets and digital currency transactions. It also founded the Global Digital Asset Exchange, where bitcoin (and as of May, ethereum) can be transacted. Access to the professional trading platform is also available to Australians.\n\n""We have Coinbase, which is for retail investors and for professional traders, we have GDAX,"" Ankur Nandwani, product manager at Coinbase, tells Mashable Australia.\n\nNow in 33 countries, Coinbase has no local staff or office. Nandwani said the delayed launch Down Under was simply a matter of getting things right.\n\n""We want to make sure we are regulated and doing everything the right way, so it took some time to figure that out,"" he explains. ""We did not encounter any substantial regulatory obstacles in accepting customers from Australia.""\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong appears on stage at the 2014 TechCrunch Disrupt Europe/London. Image: Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nDespite initially offering Coinbase with only a \'buy\' function, he suggests Australia would soon see extra features. ""When we launch in a new country, we want to take a safe approach and understand how people are using the product,"" he said. ""Right now, we are starting with \'buy\' and as we get more feedback and understand the customers more, we hope to offer the \'sell\' functionality in the near future.\n\n""In the U.S., you can buy Bitcoin by linking your bank account, you can buy it with your debit or credit cards ... we hope to expand the same functionality in Australia.""\n\nAccording to Nandwani, Coinbase has transacted more than $4 billion in digital currency since 2012. ""The goal of Coinbase is to create an open financial system for the world, and we are always looking to expand to new countries,"" he said. ""We think that Australia is an important part of our approach, so we\'re excited to launch.""\n\nBitcoin has not had an easy time in Australia. Weighed down by an Australian Taxation Office decision in 2015 to treat the digital currency like a commodity and not a currency, using it is often accompanied by a heavy tax burden.\n\nKnown as double taxation, its treatment as a commodity means it\'s liable for a 10% Goods and Services Tax (GST), which applies to Bitcoin transactions and the goods purchased, if they\'re also subject to GST.\n\nThe government signalled in March that it would be open to making changes, however. ""We will take action to address the double GST treatment of digital currencies. We won\'t be taxing digital currency,"" Treasurer Scott Morrison said at the time.', 'The Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX) announced the launch of BitcoinETI, an asset-backed Exchange Traded Instrument that is invested exclusively in Bitcoin, making it the first European-regulated product for the leading digital currency. The ETI is listed on GSX with the ticker BTCETI and is in the process of also being co-listed on Deutsche Börse in the coming weeks.\n\n“GSX is an E.U.-regulated market which offers efficient and cost-effective solutions for innovative companies and financial products,” said GSX Managing Director Nick Cowan. “We look forward to supporting the BitcoinETI in its entry to the public markets.”\n\nBitcoinETI is issued by iStructure PCC PLC, a Gibraltar-based company, in partnership with Argentarius ETI Management Limited (Listing Member of GSX and securitization specialist), Gibraltar-based fintech specialists Revoltura Limited (an iStructure PCC PLC subsidiary), the government of Gibraltar, and the Financial Services Commission (Gibraltar’s regulator).\n\n“An Exchange Traded Instrument is a stock exchange traded security that is backed by an underlying asset or a basket of assets,” Argentarius CEO Andreas Woelfl said in a statement. “European sophisticated investors such as asset managers, pension funds, and private bankers have now the possibility to capture the performance of Bitcoin through an E.U. stock exchange.”\n\nExchange Traded Instruments pegged to the value of Bitcoin are convenient for traditional investors who want to bet on Bitcoin without going through the hassle of trading Bitcoin itself.\n\nBitcoin Tracker One, a trust listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, is up 66 percent since April 1. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which trades on the OTC markets and was created by Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert, is up 120 percent over the same period. Earlier in July, blockchain technology company SolidX Partners filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the proposed launch of the SolidX Bitcoin Trust, a new Exchange Traded Fund for traditional investors.\n\n“By listing the ETI on the Gibraltar Stock Exchange, which is an E.U.-regulated market, we are able to bring a high-level of transparency and liquidity to investors,” said Revoltura CEO Ransu Salovaara. “BitcoinETI is available through regulated brokerage firms across Europe and settlements are handled through Clearstream/Euroclear, just like any other securities.”\n\nSalovaara added that Bitcoin’s annual growth was 30 percent last year, and as of July 2016 the year-to-date growth is another 50 percent. “Also importantly, the daily trading volume is around €1 billion,” he said.\n\nIn a recent Steemit post, Salovaara explained further that BitcoinETI enables asset managers, hedge fund managers and other professional investors to invest in unregulated Bitcoin through a stock exchange and standard settlement system (Euroclear), just like investing in any other security.\n\nReuters notes that BitcoinETI will be available through regulated brokerages across Europe, and that regulation of Bitcoin and fintech in Europe is more agile than in the United States, where the Winklevoss twins have been waiting for approval for a proposed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund for three years.\n\nBitcoinETI has its own brand new website with daily charts, resources, and a prospectus for investors. The ETI, defined as a UCITS-eligible, asset-backed security whose value and the related performance is linked to the underlying asset (Bitcoin) collateralized in a segregated cell, can be purchased by suitable investors through their usual brokers, with a minimum investment of €100,000, a management fee of 1.75 percent, and two days settlement via Clearstream/Euroclear.\n\nThe BitcoinETI issuers express confidence that the value of Bitcoin could grow exponentially over the coming years, and invite portfolio managers seeking alternative assets to consider the digital currency as a way to diversify their investments and boost their performance.\n\nThe announcement notes that the new Bitcoin ETI forms part of a series of early initiatives aimed at establishing Gibraltar as a virtual currency hub. There are other virtual currency hubs in Europe, most notably the Isle of Man — and arguably the whole U.K. — but Gibraltar could become especially interesting in the future. In fact, the tiny region — a British overseas territory geographically located in mainland Spain and a major point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations — has established itself as an online gambling and financial services center, and could become an important U.K.-E.U. interface after Brexit.\n\n“We continue to work with the private sector and our regulator on an appropriate regulatory environment for operators in the digital currency space, and the launch of this ETI on our stock exchange demonstrates our ability to be innovative and deliver speed to market,” said Gibraltar’s Minister for Financial Services and Gaming, Albert Isola. “I am delighted to welcome BitcoinETI to Gibraltar and congratulate GSX and Argentarius on this initiative.”\n\nRevoltura hinted at plans to introduce and list further digital currency and disruptive technology instruments in the near future.', 'The European Commission – the executive arm of the European Union – has proposed a directive aimed preventing the use the financial system for terrorist financing which includes a central database for bitcoin and virtual currency users’ identities and wallet addresses accessible to government financial intelligence units (FIUs).\n\nThe proposal seeks to require member states to bring into force the regulations necessary to comply with this directive by Jan. 1, 2017.\n\nThe updated anti-money laundering rules adopted May of 2015 marked an important step to improve the effectiveness of EU attempts to combat money laundering from criminal activities and to fight financing terrorist activities, the proposal noted.\n\nThe global financial system makes it easy to hide and move funds by creating layers of companies, crossing borders and hiding money streams. Terrorists and other criminals can cover their tracks.\n\nSound Financial System Needed\n\nThe proposal seeks to address the gaps in the oversight of terrorist financial tactics, including the use of virtual currency, and at the same time avoid unneeded obstacles for law-abiding businesses. It noted the need to balance the need to improve security and the need to protect fundamental rights, including economic freedom and data protection.\n\nOn Feb. 2, 2016, the commission gave an action plan to strengthen the fight against terrorist financing, focusing on two main areas: 1) tracing terrorists through financial movement and preventing the movement of assets, and 2) disrupting the sources of revenue terrorist organizations use.\n\nOn Feb. 12, 2016, the EU’s Economic and Financial Affairs Ministers Council (ECOFIN) asked the commission to offer a proposal to amend the Fourth Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD) by the second quarter. On April 22, ECOFIN also sought action to improve the accessibility of beneficial ownership registers.\n\nThe European Parliament in May voted in a non-binding resolution to approve a proposal for a task force to look into virtual currencies, CCN reported.\n\nEU Seeks To Empower Member States\n\nThe new proposal provides a framework to enable member states to be up to date and better equipped to meet challenges.\n\nThe amendments seek a single market for payments establishing more innovative and safer payment services across the EU. They also seek a framework for private and public online services, electronic commerce, a reformed data protection regime, and a digital single market for Europe.\n\nBecause organized criminal and terrorism financing can damage the financial sector’s stability and threaten the internal market, any measures adopted solely at the national level could have adverse effects on the EU Single Market. Given the cross-border nature of the terrorist threats, the proposed rules must be consistent at the Union level to be effective.\n\nFocus On Virtual Currency\n\nTo allow authorities to monitor suspicious virtual currency transactions, all gatekeepers that control access to virtual currencies should be defined as obliged entities under 4AMLD, especially wallet providers and exchanges, the proposal noted.\n\nThe commission consulted with public authorities on the proposal, along with representatives of the payment services sector, financial sector, financial intelligence units, Europol, consumer organizations, and virtual currency market players (wallet providers, exchanges and others.)\n\nThe commission completed surveys on Jan. 27, 2016 of member states on how national authorities collect data to assess suspected terrorist activities and to what extent the information can be used by national authorities to detect terrorist financing. The survey also examined the extent to which prepaid instruments and virtual currencies have been used in terrorist financing.\n\nInsufficient Monitoring Cited\n\nThe proposal’s impact assessment noted the following:\n\n1) Suspicious transactions involving high-risk countries are not efficiently monitored due to uncoordinated customer due diligence requirements;\n\n2) Suspicious transactions through virtual currencies are not sufficiently monitored by the authorities;\n\n3) Current measures to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with anonymous prepaid instruments are insufficient;\n\n4) FIUs are limited in ensuring timely access to – and exchange of – information held by obliged entities;\n\n5) FIUs lack access to information on the identity of holders of payment accounts.\n\nThe option to improve detection of suspicious virtual currency transactions consists of a combination of means: bringing virtual currency exchange platforms and custodial wallet providers under the scope of the directive, while allowing more time to consider options for a voluntary self-identification of virtual currency users.\n\nCentral Registry Sought For Virtual Currency\n\nThe option retained to provide FIUs access to information on the identity of payment account holders is to put in place an automated central mechanism – such as a central registry or an electronic data retrieval system – at the member state level. This mechanism would be directly accessible to national FIUs and other authorities active in the field of anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing.\n\nThe commission proposes to amend Article 2, to add to the list of obliged entities virtual currency exchange platforms as well as wallet providers.\n\nA number of risks were highlighted in respect of providers of exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies. The proposal noted virtual currency transactions benefit from a higher degree of anonymity than classical financial fund transfers and therefore entail a risk that virtual currency may be used by terrorist organizations.\n\nThe EU does not monitor virtual currency transfers, since no rules have been set. To adequately respond to risks, it is necessary to provide a regulatory framework for the functioning of exchanges as well as of custodian wallet providers.\n\nAlso read: Digital currencies see strict rule proposals by the European Commission\n\nAnonymity As A Hindrance To Virtual Currencies\n\nThe proposal noted the credibility of virtual currencies will not improve if they are used for criminal purposes. In this context, anonymity will be more of a hindrance than an asset for virtual currencies.\n\nThe inclusion of virtual exchange platforms and wallet providers in the directive will not fully address the issue of anonymity connected to virtual currency transactions since a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous as users can also transact without exchange platforms or wallets, the proposal noted.\n\nTo counter the risks related to the anonymity, national FIUs should be able to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to authorities voluntarily should be considered.\n\nThe proposal defines “virtual currencies” as “a digital representation of value that is neither issued by a central bank or a public authority, nor necessarily attached to a fiat currency, but is accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of payment and can be transferred, stored or traded electronically.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'With a Court in Manhattan sentencing a Bitcoin scammer to one and half years in prison, experts say it is a move in the right direction and would instill a higher level of sanity within the digital currency ecosystem.\n\nSeveral schemes surrounding the crypto world has taken advantage of the growth in awareness of digital currency to defraud unsuspecting individuals.\n\nWith many self-acclaimed investment opportunities littering the internet, cases of scam and Ponzi schemes have become a common occurrence in recent times.\n\nOneFxZone and HashOcean are two of such schemes that have been uncovered recently by Cointelegraph. However the events at a Manhattan court on Thursday July 21 2016 seems a step in the right direction in fighting internet scam, especially as it affects digital currencies.\n\nThe sentence\n\nTrendon Shavers, who operated a Bitcoin Savings and Trust was sentenced to one and half years in prison, and also ordered to forfeit $1.23 million and pay restitution in the same amount for operating what was called a “class Ponzi scheme”. This sentence was delivered by a US District Judge, Lewis Kaplan in a Manhattan court.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph about the impact of this judgement on the crypto space, George Basiladze, the Founder of the UK payment gateway Cryptopay, thinks it is high time a precedent is set.\n\nHe says:\n\n“I think that this case emerged in a very timely manner - there are hundreds of bitcoin ponzi schemes and investment scams on the market. Now, there is a official statement - fraudsters will be punished, even scammers within the bitcoin community. Beware!”\n\nJurisdiction\n\nThe President of Bitwage, Jonathan Chester points out what he thinks are the salient aspects of the judgment.\n\nChester explains that by the standards of the United states, it was clear that Shavers was operating an illegal ponzi scheme.\n\nChester says:\n\n“Clearly, by United States standards, Trendon Shavers was operating an illegal ponzi scheme. Regardless of his use of bitcoins, his operations were illegal. In fact, he caused investors to lose $1.23m. It is important to understand the legal landscape of the jurisdiction you are working in and it is even more important to constantly have consumer protection at top of mind. Regardless of whether or not Shavers had bad intentions, he clearly portrayed gross negligence on both of these fronts.”\n\nConsumer protection\n\nAnother point noted by Chester is the fact that most governments are very amicable to innovation and want to foster an environment to allow for innovation. Hence, the government’s responsibility to protect her citizens.\n\nChester explains:\n\n“I actually was sitting down for lunch with various members of the european parliament the other day who were visiting silicon valley to learn how they can foster the innovation mindset of silicon valley throughout europe. However, when consumer protection is involved, governments, especially developed nations, typically get involved, even in nascent industries. This is particularly true if malintent is involved. It is important for the government to take action against people who leverage a new technology in a way that is designed to hurt people for personal gain. We are paying governments with taxes to protect us after all.”\n\nSystem vulnerability\n\nAccording to Chester, it is interesting to think that maybe it is harder for a fraudster or a thief to get away with a major scam in Ethereum. Chester explains that this can clearly be evidenced in the recent hard fork to fix what happened with the $50m DAO heist.\n\nHe concludes:\n\n“Because the Ethereum ecosystem is currently so small, it is not very hard to enforce changes to the state of the ledger. Should a scammer attempt to pull another heist, there could possibly be another hard fork for the sake of consumer protection.”\n\nThis may actually push more scammers to Bitcoin. It may also mean that Ethereum is more easily influenced by government regulators wanting to control the payment system.', 'The weakening economy of Venezuela under the regime of President Nicolas Maduro is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to reach a consumer-price inflation rate of 480 percent by the end of this year, and peak at 1,640 percent in 2017.\n\nVenezuela’s growing financial crisis and economic collapse also pressured the government to announce a state of “economic emergency,” which immediately gave the Venezuelan government full control over the goods, assets, properties and food of private companies.\n\nThe state of “economic emergency,” which was extended for another 60 days by Maduro on July 13, basically requires every company registered under the Venezuelan regulatory framework — both private and public companies — to give up their capital to the government to settle its outstanding financial debt.\n\nThe rapidly growing inflation rate and fears of forceful seizure of company assets by the government have driven a surge in demand for foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, that can be transported out of the country and protected from seizure by the Venezuelan government.\n\nAccording to various reports, the black market rate for U.S. dollars has increased to 1,000 Venezuelan bolivars per dollar, which is 100 times higher than the official government rate of 9.95 bolivar per dollar. The Venezuelan black market data displays a staggering 82 percent decrease in the value of the national currency in a span of 12 months.\n\nSince mid-2015, the U.S. dollar and other international currencies including Bitcoin have been perceived as ideal alternatives to the bolivar for both businesses and individuals because of the high international value of these two currencies.\n\nThe U.S. dollar, which leads the world’s M1 money supply rankings, possesses the highest international exchange and conversion rate among all national currencies. Bitcoin, a digital currency based on a decentralized network of computers, offers its users ideal international conversion rates because of its decentralized, established international infrastructure and high liquidity.\n\nAs the government’s control over the flow of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies in the Venezuelan black market has tightened, Venezuelans have began to search for alternatives such as Bitcoin to store their wealth.\n\nThe increase in the demand for Bitcoin directly led to the explosive growth of Local Bitcoins Venezuela, a platform whereby Bitcoin buyers and sellers can process in-person trades without the involvement of an exchange. The demand for Bitcoin exchanges surged, with the country’s first Bitcoin exchange, SurBitcoin, offering a platform for Venezuelans to purchase bitcoins through conventional bank payment methods.\n\nNaturally, as demand for bitcoins began to increase, the volume of the country’s only Bitcoin exchange spiked, reaching a 24-hour volume of 48 BTC or $31,200.\n\nAlthough the daily trade volume of SurBitcoin is substantially lower than established Bitcoin exchanges in the Bitcoin market, the exchange is observing hundreds of buy orders on a daily basis, which, considering the financial instability of the Venezuelan economy, is extremely optimistic.\n\nEarlier this month, the price of Bitcoin for both buy and sell orders in Venezuela reached the lowest rate in the entire Bitcoin market, hitting $407, while other major exchanges including Bitstamp and Kraken averaged at $635. This crash was due to the exchange’s trouble integrating one of the main domestic banks in Venezuela that has been used to settle most of the trades on the platform.\n\nDespite the negative press, economic instability, and panic sale of Bitcoin on SurBitcoin, its daily volume has increased continuously since the exchange reopened on July 16, after suspending operations for a few days in order to deal with a series of legal issues and conflicts with an individual who had threatened a few of the exchange’s key officers.', 'In the digital currency world, people love to talk about the “killer app,” a use for the technology that would bring it truly mainstream and compel the people who are dubious about Bitcoin to buy in. Many are still waiting for it, and say bitcoin needs it to succeed in the long run. Ned Scott believes he’s got it.\n\nScott is the cofounder and CEO of Steemit, a social network that runs on a new cryptocurrency called steem. Scott, a former analyst at food-industry private equity firm Gellert Group, and Dan Larimer, founder of BitShares, launched the network and the currency in April. Since that time, its market cap has ballooned from $2,000 to $300 million. The platform is very young, and has its problems, but it shows impressive potential.\n\nSteemit works like Reddit, which Scott cites as an overt influence but says he hasn’t used. Steemit users publish a blog post—it could be any length, any topic at all—and other users can “upvote” it. The twist: Every upvote represents a small amount of steem power. Think of steem power as a representation of influence, because the more you have, the more power your upvote has to move someone else’s post up when you upvote it. Steem power can be converted to steem dollars, which at the moment trade for about $3.25 USD each.\n\nThat’s tiny, sure, but more steem is created from more activity on Steemit, and the $300 million market cap of steem is enough to rank it No. 3 among all cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap, behind only bitcoin and ether, the currency of the Ethereum network.\n\nSteemit’s ‘trending’ forum More\n\n“It’s internet points, like you have on Reddit, but now those points have real market value,” says Scott. “People are earning money for doing the things they were doing for free before. People spend all this time creating free content for social media companies, and now they can be rewarded.”\n\nThat sounds pretty good. And indeed, multiple Steemit users say they have cashed out more than $10,000 from posting on Steemit. The site pays you 24 hours after a post; 75% of the steem power goes to the writer, 25% to the curators—that is, those who upvoted the post, in different amounts according to their influence. Steemit made its first cumulative payout on July 4, amounting to $1.3 million USD. Steemit says it has seen more than 700 new signups every day for the past week.\n\nHeidi Chakos, a travel blogger, says she paid off her credit card bill this month entirely with money she made on Steemit. The Indiana resident is currently traveling around the world in two-week spurts, and she posts about her adventures; one recent post about Tahiti earned 660 upvotes, or $8,930 in steem power. Chakos previously used a Squarespace blog for her posts, but now posts solely on Steemit. “For others, it all might seem farfetched at first,” she says, “but in my experience, once you explain ceryptocurrency to people, they get exited about it. I think Steemit is going to blow Facebook out of the water.”\n\nAt this point, that’s likely a stretch. But as a test, I posted on Steemit. It was nothing special: I wrote that I’m a Yahoo Finance writer and I was exploring Steemit to write a news story about it. My post quickly amassed 61 votes, which translates to $75.04 in steem power. The system cashed that out to me in half steem power, half steem, so I have 37.5 steem dollars in my wallet, which translates to $120. Not bad.\n\nIf all of that sounds rather complicated, Scott insists that users don’t need to worry about how the system works to use it and make money. It is an argument many have made about the bitcoin blockchain, comparing it to the HTTP technology that powers web pages, or the SMTP protocol that makes e-mail work. “You don’t need a high level of understanding to sign up,” he says. “Digital currency is moving into a stage similar to the automobile: it gets you from point A to point B. People post, they get money, and their lives are better. They don’t need to know the way it works or worry too much about the specifics in order to post, enjoy it, and get rewarded.”\n\nStory Continues', 'Bitcoin micropayments startup SatoshiPay is developing a new proof-of-concept with Visa Europe\'s innovation unit.\n\nWork on the project was first disclosed earlier this year, when Visa Europe Collab said that it was exploring bitcoin micropayments for connected devices. At the time, the company indicated it was looking at use cases like smart light bulbs that could pay for their own electricity.\n\nThe concept, according to SatoshiPay founder Meinhard Benn, involves the integration of the startup’s technology with Visa’s card payments structure, allowing for automated micropayments from a person’s Visa account to a SatoshiPay wallet.\n\nBenn said that the proof-of-concept seeks to ""establish a safer method of purchasing small amounts of bitcoin using credit and debit cards"".\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""During the PoC, we will establish a safer method of purchasing small amounts of bitcoin using credit and debit cards. With a process for fiat payments in place, we will also integrate other payment local methods like direct debit or instant bank transfers.""\n\nBenn said Visa plans to work with the firm to explore how its technology could be used for machine-to-machine payments and IoT devices. Other plans include a future user study conducted in conjunction with Visa Europe Collab on micropayments for web content.\n\nThe project isn\'t Visa Europe Collab’s foray into bitcoin.

07/27/2016,"['Bitcoin has been described as ""a new kind of money."" That\'s because the digital currency doesn’t rely on an exchange of paper and there is no centralized bank that records your transaction.\n\nThis week, a Miami-Dade judge disagreed, issuing a ruling that Bitcoin is not, in fact, money. The ruling came in response to what is likely the first of its kind: a criminal case involving Bitcoin and money laundering.\n\nThe defendant in the case, Michell Espinoza, had an account on a website, localbitcoins.com, where he allegedly sold Bitcoin for a profit. In 2013, Detective Arias from the Miami Beach Police Department, together with Special Agent Gregory Ponzi (insert all of your Ponzi scheme jokes here) from the U.S. Secret Service, while acting undercover, approached Espinoza about a potential purchase of Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to court documents, at a second arranged sale, Detective Arias told Espinoza that he was in the business of buying stolen credit card numbers from the Russians. He was, he explained, using Bitcoin to pay for the stolen credit card numbers. At that time, Detective Arias asked Espinoza if he would be interested in accepting stolen credit card numbers as payment for Bitcoin in the future and Espinoza allegedly replied that ""he would think about it."" At no time, however, did Espinoza ever exchange Bitcoin for stolen credit card numbers.\n\nDetective Arias arranged for more transactions involving the purchase of Bitcoin from Espinoza. At the final transaction, Detective Arias again mentioned that he dealt in stolen credit cards and showed Espinoza $30,000 in counterfeit bills which he purported to be genuine. Espinoza was concerned that the cash was counterfeit and did not take the cash. He was nonetheless arrested and charged with one count of unlawfully engaging in business as a money services business (amended later by the State to include the term ""payment instrument seller"") and two counts of money laundering.\n\nMiami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler threw out all charges. On the first charge of engaging in business as a money services business, she wrote that ""attempting to fit the sale of Bitcoin into a statutory scheme regulating money services businesses is like fitting a square peg in a round hole."" Bitcoin is not, she noted ""backed by anything"" and is ""certainly not tangible wealth and cannot be hidden under a mattress like cash and gold bars.""\n\nInstead, she wrote, while dismissing the charge, ""This Court is not an expert in economics, however, it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, that Bitcoin has a long way to go before it the equivalent of money.""', 'The launch of Ethereum Classic and its support by the community has raised a lot of questions. More particularly, what about the exchanges where users can buy Ethereum with Bitcoin and then have it sold back to double their holdings? Apparently, such a scenario is possible when using Coinbase, GDAX, and Poloniex, according to several Twitter users.\n\nThe concept of this entire procedure is very simple and straightforward, although it is not advisable to do so. One Twitter user mentioned how it is, in theory, possible to double one’s Bitcoin by using Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. To pull these attacks off, however, users will need to verify their identity with at last two out of three platforms involved. Do keep in mind these companies can sue users for exploiting this loophole if they wanted to.\n\nTricking Coinbase And GDAX\n\nIt is not entirely surprising this method involves two exchange platforms which do not support Ethereum Classic at this stage. In fact, both GDAX and Coinbase have been dabbling around with Ethereum for a just a short while. As a first step, Bitcoin holders would need to transfer BTC funds to their Coinbase wallet. Once the funds cleared, send it from Coinbase to the GDAX exchange as soon as possible.\n\nUsers can exchange Bitcoin for Ether on GDAX – albeit they can do so on Coinbase as well – and the obtained ETH funds need to be transferred back to Coinbase. From that wallet, users should then sluice the funds to Poloniex, in the hopes of having their account credited with both ETH and ETC at the same time.\n\nPulling off this exploit is still possible if one is lucky enough to buy Ether from Coinbase, which were not moved before the hard fork. Since the exchange put zero preparation into avoiding replay attacks from happening, users are effectively able to double their Bitcoin balance once the funds go from CB to Poloniex.\n\nDespite the best efforts by Poloniex to prevent replay attacks from happening, there is little they can do about funds being “marked” as “pre-fork”. GDAX and Coinbase need to sort these issues out as soon as possible before things get out of hand. However, they do not seem inclined to do so for the time being.\n\nKeeping User Funds Hostage In Cold Storage\n\nPerhaps it is good neither Coinbase nor GDAX is trading Ethereum Classic at this time, considering how users can exploit this bug across these two platforms for quite some time. Moreover, there is a bigger question as to how either of those platforms will reimburse users who rightfully own ETC in the first place.\n\nGDAX has announced they will let users withdraw funds equal to the amount of ETH they had in their wallet at the time of the hard fork. However, all of the funds generated after the fork will remain in GDAX’s custody. Coinbase remains tightlipped on their plans, and they will probably wait and see what happens to the GDAX withdrawals first.\n\nLuckily, these issues seem to be much harder to pull off as we speak. Poloniex ensures all incoming funds goes to either the ETC or ETH blockchain respectively, instead of having the two linked together. Situations like these could have been avoided if all Bitcoin/Ethereum exchanges had taken proper countermeasures in the first place.\n\nSource: Reddit\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Image: Shutterstock\n\nLast week, Ethereum took the incredibly risky step of splitting its virtual currency and app platform into two competing versions. The split allowed developers to implement a code change that rescued $56 million of users\' money, which had been siphoned away by an unknown hacker.\n\nThe split also created the possibility that rabble-rousers could mount some resistance and commandeer the old version of Ethereum for themselves. And now, that\'s what\'s happened.\n\nEthereum\'s big gamble has spawned a rebellion comprised of several factions: true believers in the cryptocurrency, speculative opportunists, and possibly even bitcoiners who have turned to sabotage in order to see Ethereum go down in flames.\n\nThis isn\'t how things were supposed to go. Hours after the split, referred to as a ""hard fork,"" it looked like everything had gone smoothly. Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin announced the success, and noted that the majority of users had moved over to the new version. At this point, most expected the original Ethereum to languish and die.\n\nBut then the unexpected happened: loyalists rebranded the original Ethereum as ""Ethereum Classic."" The currency is being propped up under the banner of ideological consistency. The sell is that Ethereum Classic is a home for people who believe that forking Ethereum to ""bail out"" the victims of the hack was a betrayal of the concept of ""immutability"" that underlies other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin—what happens on the chain, stays on the chain.\n\n""Ethereum represents a real threat to bitcoin, and there are some corners who have wanted to kill Ethereum since its inception""\n\n\n\nEthereum Classic is essentially an ""altcoin""—a clone of an existing cryptocurrency that a small community has rallied around to give it value. Bitcoin has hundreds of imitators, but this is Ethereum\'s first.\n\nAlthough Classic has far fewer users than Ethereum proper, its currency, ETC, has made price gains of more than 200 percent—peaking at about $2 per token on Wednesday—and is highly volatile. At the time of writing, ETC is trading at just over a dollar, compared to $13 per Ethereum token. ETC is trading on major exchanges such as Kraken and Poloniex.\n\nButerin has gone on record as saying that an alternate currency based on his code isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. However, it\'s still a dangerous situation for users, even beyond the normal concerns about get-rich-quick schemes and network insecurity that are endemic to cryptocurrencies with a small user base.\n\n""You can very easily get into a bad situation,"" said Peter Vessenes, a cryptographer and former head of the nonprofit Bitcoin Foundation, which exists to promote bitcoin.\n\nFor example, users may fall victim to a ""replay attack."" Because the two versions of Ethereum are copies of each other, actions that take place on the main Ethereum chain can be copied onto the Classic chain. On Tuesday, just days after the fork, users rushed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to withdraw ether (the currency of Ethereum, also called ETH) and copy the transactions over to the Classic chain, thereby doubling their payout by receiving the amount in both currencies. Coinbase\'s supply of ETC was likely drained fairly quickly, Vessenes said.\n\nThe Coinbase attack wasn\'t all that bad, but future instances could cause a lot more chaos. ""Somebody is essentially allowed to edit history, and you can\'t do anything because your actions are already out there,"" Vessenes continued.\n\nThe attack could be more damaging in the case of a two-party ""smart contract,"" Vessenes noted. In a very simple hypothetical example, if someone were to play a game on Ethereum with a contract that pays out a small sum to the winner, and the losing party approves all the actions, then that person\'s approval could be copied over to the Classic chain and augmented to deal out a much larger sum.\n\n\n\n""It\'s a totally new situation in computer science""\n\n""Nobody has done any thinking about that security model yet,"" said Vessenes. ""It\'s a totally new situation in computer science. We\'ll get some good Masters and PhD theses on this in three years, I think.""\n\nCornell University professor and hacker Emin Gün Sirer agreed with Vessenes\' assessment, although he noted that right now the issue only affects people who dabble in both Ethereum proper and Ethereum Classic\'s economies, on exchanges that handle both currencies.\n\n""It\'s like, unbeknownst to you, there was a group out there that was using Tide detergent bottles as currency,"" Sirer wrote me in an email. ""It doesn\'t affect my use of the laundry detergent at all—I would still buy it in bulk, use it at my house, and discard the bottles. The problems only manifest themselves if I decide to participate in their economy, if I decide to bridge the two worlds.""\n\nAny problems could be solved fairly easily if both Ethereum Classic and Ethereum proper decide to play nice, Vessenes suggested. Either Classic or the main chain could fork again in order to make all transaction IDs slightly different, thus eliminating replay attacks, and then both communities would be free to pursue their ideological and economic goals.\n\nSince that hasn\'t happened, some in the Ethereum community have come to suspect that the Classic rebellion may have conspiratorial elements.\n\n""Ethereum represents a real threat to bitcoin, and there are some corners who have wanted to kill Ethereum since its inception,"" said Stephan Tual, founder of Slock.it and one of the developers behind the DAO.\n\nAfter all, Ethereum is the first cryptocurrency to really have a chance at usurping bitcoin. It\'s also true that while bitcoin has yet to widely implement self-executing smart contracts, which are administered by computers and exist forever on the blockchain, they\'re at the core of Ethereum.\n\n""I don\'t believe that the reasoning behind Ethereum Classic is genuine,"" Tual said. ""As a business model, it\'s basically: \'lets copy and paste this thing, and even though nobody has ownership and nobody\'s going to innovate on it, somewhere it has value.\' It doesn\'t make any sense.""\n\nIt does appear as though some bitcoiners are cheering for Ethereum Classic and the chaos caused by the split, at least on Reddit.\n\n""Some number of bitcoiners are known as \'maximalists\' which means they don\'t think any other blockchains or digital assets should exist,"" prominent bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees wrote me in an email. ""They hate Ethereum, and they have been overjoyed by the turmoil since the fork. They can support Ethereum Classic because it perpetuates the time until this little crisis gets resolved.""\n\nRegardless of where the Classic rebellion is coming from, the software everyone expected to die is nonetheless clinging to life and getting stronger—at least for now.\n\n""Best case for Ethereum is for the fork to be \'resolved,\' meaning one of the chains falls toward zero price and hash rate,"" Voorhees continued. ""It will happen eventually, but it\'s taking longer than most people thought (myself included) and longer than anyone in Ethereum would\'ve liked.""\n\nThere\'s no telling what will happen next, or which version of Ethereum will eventually win out. However, the smart money\'s on the version with a strong community of developers and a roadmap that stretches years into the future. That, in case you\'re wondering, is the newly forked version.\n\n""Bitcoin has had hundreds of copycats, so it\'s not surprising that Ethereum has one,"" Sirer wrote. ""In the long term, value comes from the dev team and the user community, and this overwhelmingly favors ETH.""', 'A team of economists from UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies, Deutsche Bundesbank, University of Wisconsin and The New School have published a research paper titled “The Evolution of the Bitcoin Economy: Extracting and Analyzing the Network of Payment Relationships.”\n\nThe economists’ conclusion is that the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured from an early prototype stage, through a second growth stage characterized by “sin” (i.e. gambling, black markets), to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from “sin” and toward legitimate enterprises.\n\nThe conclusion is hardly surprising: Blockchain-related press headlines, which used to be mostly about Mt. Gox and Silk Road only a couple of years ago, today tend to be about banks, exchanges and even central banks taking steps toward the operational use of blockchain technology. Nevertheless, it’s interesting to see how this conclusion was reached by thorough economic analysis.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to senior author Paolo Tasca, a director at the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies, to find out more about the research and related issues. Tasca, a fintech economist specializing in P2P financial systems and systemic risk, is a former senior research economist at Deutsche Bundesbank and a co-editor of the book “Banking Beyond Banks and Money.”\n\n“Our study starts by gathering together the minimum units of Bitcoin identities (the individual addresses) and it goes forward in grouping them into approximations of business entities, what we call ‘super clusters,’ by using tested techniques from the literature,” explained Tasca. “A super cluster can be thought of as an approximation of a business entity in that it describes a number of individual addresses that are owned or controlled collectively by the same beneficial owner for some special economic purposes. The majority of these important clusters are initially unknown and uncategorized.”\n\n“The novelty of our study is given by the Pure User Group (PUG) and the Transaction Pattern (TP) analyses, by means of which we are able to ascribe the super clusters into specific business categories and outline a map of the network of payment relationships among them,” continued Tasca.\n\nThe researchers identified four primary business categories in the Bitcoin economy: miners, gambling services, black markets and exchanges. It also included the three regimes mentioned above: early prototyping, “sin” and legitimate enterprises.\n\nThe researchers studied the patterns of transaction behavior between the business categories and their users. The outcome of the study, which provides a quantitative assessment of the systemically important categories within the Bitcoin economy and their network of payment relationships, suggests a relevant public policy conclusion: Some recent concerns regarding the use of bitcoin for illegal transactions at the present time might be overstated and whatever such transactions may exist could further diminish as the Bitcoin economy continues to mature.\n\nThe University College London (UCL) Centre for Blockchain Technologies (CBT) is an interdepartmental, industry-oriented unit of UCL with the purpose to set the foundations for a new cross-disciplinary research area on distributed-consensus ledgers. The UCL CBT — currently comprising more than 30 research associates and seven funding departments with competences around three major research areas: Science and Technology, Economics and Finance and Policy, Law and Regulation — is committed to becoming the leading European research hub with an industry focus on the impact of blockchain technologies on socio-economic systems and the promotion of a safe and organic development and adoption of blockchain-based platforms.\n\nTasca isn’t at liberty to share much information on UCL-CBT projects because of confidentiality restrictions. However, he confirmed that the UCL-CBT is involved in U.K. government initiatives to develop and deploy blockchain technology.\n\n“Specifically, in U.K. the UCL-CBT is interacting with: 1) the Department of Work and Pension on a specific case study for payment system, 2) BoE, FCA on the use of smart contracts for algorithmic regulation and on the design of central bank issued digital currencies, 3) UCL-CBT is represented with Whitechapel Think Tank on distributed ledger technologies,” noted Tasca. “In addition, the CBT is involved with several projects with the Alan Turing Institute.”\n\nDiscussing the top opportunities and threats for blockchain-based fintech, Tasca noted that this is a complicated issue because blockchain technologies can find application in different domains. However, while most interest has come from the financial industry so far, Tasca expects to see more future activity in other sectors such as energy, telecommunications, media and healthcare.\n\n“New opportunities will emerge for them to redesign their business logic,” Tasca told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n“The major threat I see so far is the lack of ‘technology literacy’: the lack of the ability to understand how blockchain works in the world,” continued Tasca. “This can hamper the development and spread of the technology. Thus, a more important educational effort is required to help blockchain become a mainstream technology used in different business processes: This represents the long-term aim and goal of the UCL-CBT.”\n\nTo advance this important educational effort, the UCL-CBT will host the P2P Financial Systems 2016 (P2PFISY 2016) international workshop in September. “This is the second edition of the P2PFISY workshop,” said Tasca. “This is a unique event in Europe because it will bring together scholars, regulators and practitioners interested in addressing questions of practical importance on digital currencies and blockchain technologies, P2P lending and crowdfunding, digital money transfer, mobile banking and mobile payments.”\n\nTasca declined to comment on the recent unfortunate events related to Ethereum and The DAO. However, he is persuaded that blockchain technologies — especially through smart contracts, agent automation and DAOs — represent a new institutional technology: a new form of crypto-economic mechanism which allows governing of the difficulties inherent in transacting.\n\n“Opportunism (e.g., adverse selection, moral hazard) is by far the more difficult market friction which has been handled so far via traditional organizational hierarchies (which exploit incomplete contracts) and bilateral agreements (which require trust between parties),” Tasca told Bitcoin Magazine. “Now, blockchains, smart contracts and DAOs can eliminate opportunism or at least compete with traditional forms of hierarchies and bilateral contracting. Their use case applications are very large and may include escrows, voting, and eviction, among the others. The combined use of the blockchain and smart contracts creates a platform where individuals can exchange, manufacture and execute contracts with considerable sophistication and with little cost. In perspective, by using appropriate automations (and its inherent standardization), they may evolve and bring about the completeness of missing markets.\n\n“I just wish to point out that our society is used to failures since the beginning of the first barter trades in the prehistoric age,” continued Tasca. “These did not stop with the advent of more sophisticated technologies and markets. The fact that now, thanks to technology, business can be run independently — without human intervention in the decision-making process — by machines, is welcome, but do not remove the sources of business risks which can bring failures.“Having said that, in the particular case under discussion, many of Ethereum developers were also involved to some degree with The DAO. This brought an enormous conflict of interest because those who have the ability to shape changes in the Ethereum protocol had also a stake on one of its main applications, The DAO. Indeed, Ethereum is controlled by Vitalik Buterin mostly via his private Swiss-based non-profit organization, which received the proceeds of the ether auction, financing most of the development of Ethereum so far and which may own or control some of the resulting work.“To conclude, the conflict of interest led to a lose-lose strategy: Ethereum, also stakeholder of The DAO, decided to bail out the too-big-to-fail business. Without going into a debate about the quality of the code review process before releasing it to the market, this bailout has set a precedent and it would not be easy in the future to handle opportunistic moral-hazard behaviors.“Maybe, to bring more transparency, the entire governance structure of the Ethereum community with clear rules between all the stakeholders shall be redesigned based on pure principles of decentralized autonomous organizations.“As a side note, the methodology used in our study could be applied to the Ethereum blockchain to map the network of payments there and include smart contracts and DAOs as categories.”\n\nThe recent publication of the much-discussed Bank of England (BoE) working paper titled “The Macroeconomics of Central Bank Issued Digital Currencies,” focused on the macroeconomic consequences of issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC) and shows that digital currencies are really and clearly on a fast path toward mainstream adoption.\n\nTasca noted that the paper implicitly borrows from the idea of George Danezis and Sarah Meiklejohn (2015) of having a cryptocurrency framework that decouples the generation of the monetary supply from the maintenance of the transaction ledger and suggested that central bank-certified institutions should act as verifiers. However, he noted that as it has been modelled, the CBDC is more similar to a “digicash"" type of solution than a P2P digital currency, and the generation of digital currency by the central bank is not clearly defined.', 'Bitcoin infrastructure architect Blockstream has acquired wallet provider GreenAddress in a move the startup says could impact the development of its signature, still in-development sidechains solution.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, GreenAddress Wallet\'s team of three developers will continue to work on privacy and security bolstering features for the wallet as well as compatibility for sidechains, a bitcoin infrastructure component that Blockstream has raised $76m in two investment rounds to engineer.\n\nIn interview, former GreenAddress founder and CEO Lawrence Nahum, now senior architect at Blockstream, said that the goal is to shape the wallet into a something like a portal for sidechains, a technology meant to enable a new wave of interoperable blockchains that could be anchored to the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nNahum told CoinDesk:\n\n""Blockstream is not just going to need some node service that provides some functionality, but it\'s also going to need an interface, a wallet. It will provide an integrated solution for Blockstream customers.""\n\nThe move is perhaps not surprising, as the two teams have been working closely for two years.\n\nLaunched in 2014, GreenAddress Wallet was early to support innovative wallet features, such as deterministic wallets that allow for improved key creation and multi-signature security.\n\nSidechains compatibility\n\nBut, more than absorbing GreenAddress, the two companies plan to merge their technologies.\n\nNahum explained that GreenAddress already supports Blockstream’s sidechains alpha functionality, which doesn\'t appear to be publicly supported by other wallets, and the plan is to further integrate the two.\n\nOne way for the wallet to integrate the technology is by supporting Sidechain Elements, the open-source tool that allows developers to mix and match features, such as Segregated Witness or new scripting opcodes expanding bitcoin’s functionality, to create customizable sidechains.\n\n""Schnorr transactions and confidential transactions, these are all things we’re providing support for,"" Nahum said.\n\nCurrent sidechains in-progress include the alpha testnet and the first commercial sidechain, Liquid, geared toward enabling the faster movement of funds between exchanges.\n\nIncorporating the technology into the wallet could mean further exploration of these interoperable blockchains for GreenAddress users, with the wallet eventually supporting a wide array of assets and innovations.\n\nFuture plans\n\nLooking into the future, the team hopes to continue working on other privacy and security features, including support for smart contract upgrades made to bitcoin, as well as updates to the core bitcoin code such as checklocktimeverify and checksequenceverify.\n\nWhile bitcoin offers trustless transactions, these features offer ""more trustless"" transactions, according to Nahum.\n\nThe team is also working on a multi-platform wallet library, eventually to be open sourced, which will be available across platforms and programming languages.\n\nOverall, Nahum thinks the new ownership will bode well for the wallet’s development.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""I couldn\'t wait for the acquisition.

BitMinter began in June 2011 and at its peak, it controlled 10 percent of global computing power for bitcoin mining, making it an attractive target for competitors and attackers alike. Nexusguard was able to deliver critical stability and maximum up-time for BitMinter, ensuring a predictable cash flow, uninterrupted by attacks.\n\nAnd BitMinter was able to pay in bitcoin.\n\nWhile BitMinter wasn’t the use-case that got the bitcoin ball rolling with Nexusguard, BitMinter was the first bitcoin-centered client account with the company.\n\n“After they became a customer,” said Giannis, “they were thrilled that we would accept bitcoin as a form of payment, enabling us to keep them as a loyal client and fan of Nexusguard.”\n\nBitPay’s Email Billing Tool\n\nTypically, when it comes to accepting payment from international clients, most companies opt for electronic bills or wire transfers. These both have their shortcomings: higher processing costs, fraud, delays in payment, payments that arrive with less than the full amount due and little or no information about fees.\n\nFor processing bitcoin payments, Nexusguard turned to BitPay. Established in 2011, BitPay provides merchants with an email billing tool that they can use for invoicing via bitcoin, enabling them to eliminate the transfer wait times, high fees and complex processing steps involved in international wire transfers. Nexusguard is one client taking advantage of the email billing tool to bypass the legacy international transfer system.\n\n“Bitcoin billing is especially popular among merchants that provide consulting, freelance work or software as a service,” BitPay Marketing Associate James Walpole told Bitcoin Magazine. “The transactions these firms accept through our email billing tool make up more than 10 percent of our total processing volume in USD terms and the average order size of a B2B billing payment is twenty five times the size of an average consumer bitcoin payment.”\n\nAs well as providing its services to clients such as Nexusguard, BitPay billing is also attracting smaller clients who want to reach people across the world in a fast, secure and convenient way. Latin America is one area that is experiencing the greatest transaction growth with a year-over-year increase of 1,747 percent in 2015.\n\n“The region is experiencing rapid growth in ecommerce and mobile phone use, but credit card payments are still only available to a fraction of the total population,” said Walpole. “That’s part of the reason why bitcoin makes sense for Latin America’s online consumers and for international businesses that want to reach Latin American markets.”\n\nThe Future\n\nThe fact that Nexusguard accepts bitcoin as payment has made it easier for companies in the space, like BitMinter, to pay them in a far more convenient way, without having to go through the additional hassle of converting bitcoins to U.S. dollars. As more companies discover and accept bitcoin, they begin to realize the potential for them to attract and retain a broader clientele.\n\n“Our five years of experience in bitcoin payment processing has helped us build a strong case that bitcoin can solve old problems for ecommerce and B2B payments in new ways,” said Walpole. “We’ll continue to reach out to more merchants like Nexusguard who can save money, reduce payment fraud and reach a global customer base by adding bitcoin as a payment option.”', 'The price of bitcoin has benefited from macroeconomic uncertainty this year, rising more than 50% over the last six months as China devalued the yuan and the UK dramatically exited the European Union.\n\nAs the calendar rolls ahead to August, and excitement over these price drivers fades, market observers are beginning to wonder if further global events will benefit the digital currency\'s markets in 2016.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a Bank of Japan (BOJ) meeting approaching later this week has many digital currency market observers wondering how any new easing announced by the central bank could come to impact the price of bitcoin.\n\nIf the central bank uses additional stimulus, this move could place downward pressure on the yen\'s buying power, motivating market participants to flee the currency and purchase safe haven assets like bitcoin instead. Of course, the perception that this event could occur may be just as powerful given that the bitcoin price is often driven by speculation, in both senses of the word.\n\nA majority of economists participating in a recent Reuters poll – as well as the most respondents in a survey conducted by Citi – indicated their expectation is that further easing will come from the BOJ\'s meeting, to be held on 28th and 29th July.\n\nCoinDesk received similar responses when speaking with economists.\n\nFor example Usha Haley, professor of International Business at West Virginia University, stated that the market is still expecting ""some form of easing"" at the BOJ’s policy meeting next week, even if the extent of this stimulus is not clear.\n\nFiscal policy\n\nRegardless of what methods of easing the central bank decides to use, more than one market expert emphasized the key importance of fiscal policy.\n\n""Market expectations are such that the BOJ has to do something \'big\' or they will risk disappointing the market,” said Jack McIntyre, CFA and portfolio manager for Brandywine Global Investment Management.\n\nHe said that he believes more than $10tn ($94bn) must be injected into the markets in order for the actions to be viewed ""positively"".\n\n""That fiscal stimulus cannot be smoke and mirrors – it needs to go to actual increases in government spending,"" he emphasized.\n\nChris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest, also stressed the importance of ""aggressive fiscal policy,"" noting that it is one of the few remaining options left for spurring growth since Japan’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing have been ineffective.\n\nShould the Japanese government decide to implement aggressive fiscal policy, this approach could increase the money supply and potentially spur inflation by lessening the yen’s buying power.\n\nExpert predictions\n\nWhile market observers seem to have high hopes for the Japanese government stimulus, they are divided in terms of how these initiatives will affect the yen.\n\nBurniske spoke to this situation, emphasizing how the goal of ""aggressive monetary and fiscal policy"" is spurring growth, and along with it, inflation.\n\nHe said:\n\n""Of course, inflationary fiat makes the long-term deflationary structure of bitcoin all the more appealing.""\n\nGreater BOJ stimulus might push the yen lower, Samuel Rines, senior economist and portfolio strategist for independent registered investment advisor Avalon Advisors LLC, told CoinDesk.\n\nHowever, he suggested that markets have already begun to move to offset or capitalize on this action, meaning any impact from the announcement, including any benefit to bitcoin, could be limited.\n\n""Markets have begun to price in some of the stimulus. So the amount of reaction there may be minute,"" he said.\n\nWhile the aforementioned market observers spoke to potential yen weakness on the horizon, Oana Aristide, senior economist at Dun & Bradstreet UK, spoke to the currency’s strength.\n\n""On the yen, our view is that most influences point to strength rather than weakness,” she said. ""There is more monetary easing coming in Japan, as well as a substantial fiscal stimulus package, but none of these are novel for \'Abenomics\'; it is worth noting that the BOJ\'s latest major move (switching to negative interest rates) actually resulted in a slightly stronger yen.""\n\nFinally, Aristide added that since Japanese officials have ruled out so-called helicopter money, her firm expects the yen to continue to experience volatility, but maintain a ""strengthening bias"" when compared to other major currencies.\n\nBitcoin impact\n\nDigital currency market experts seemed, on the whole, a bit more reserved in terms of how they believed such actions would affect the bitcoin market.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, described further easing as ""bullish"" for bitcoin, although he asserted that ""the BOJ’s actions are not catalytic enough to spark any significant change in trading activity in Japan"".\n\nMcIntyre cast doubts on the idea that further BOJ easing would spur investors to flock to bitcoin.\n\n""I don’t believe that a weak yen by itself drives the Japanese to shift money into bitcoin,” he said, adding:\n\n""The more likely scenario would be a flight to safety that drives Japanese money offshore. Expect to see the Japanese retail investor chase yield in places like Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and New Zealand.""\n\nCurrently, Japan is in a ""dangerous situation"" characterized by negative interest rates and balance sheets laden with cash that is not going to use, Burniske emphasized.\n\nAs the nation\'s officials make an effort to remedy Japan’s economic malaise, we will simply have to wait and see how effective they are.\n\nThe policy of other central banks – for example the Federal Reserve – will also play a key role in determining how strong the Japanese yen is relative to other currencies.\n\nShould the Asian nation require significant stimulus going forward, such developments could help drive continued weakening of the Japanese yen, spurring market participants to flee the currency, and potentially, consider alternative assets instead.\n\nImage credit: TK Kurikawa / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

07/28/2016,"['What started as an attempt to rescue investor funds in a high-profile project has resulted in a schism that has effectively split the community on the second-largest public blockchain.\n\nThe split is not only psychological. Thanks to the design of public blockchain systems, it is also technical, with competing visions manifesting in two very real blockchains, or versions of the project’s transaction history.\n\nAs of this weekend, there are now two groups working on two competing versions of a project called ethereum, a blockchain-based platform designed to enable decentralized application development.\n\nIf bitcoin envisioned how a distributed group of users could create and manage a currency, ethereum sought to allow a distributed group of users to create and manage a decentralized, uncensorable app store. (You can learn more in our latest CoinDesk Research report).\n\nHowever, there are now two slightly different versions of this platform available to users – ethereum, the \'official\' version of the blockchain maintained by its original developers, and ethereum classic, an \'alternative\' blockchain maintained by a wholly new team.\n\nBoth offer the same technology platforms, and according to developers, they\'re in agreement on a formal roadmap for steps forward. But, the small differences have created two markets, both with a combined value of roughly $1.2bn.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nLet’s start with The DAO.\n\nLong the most notable ethereum project, The DAO, short for distributed autonomous organization, raised $150m in ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – earlier this year during a public crowdsale. Held online, anyone who had ether could participate. The idea was simple, in theory. Investors would send money to The DAO and receive voting tokens, and then those who invested (and voted) would decide democratically how The DAO should disperse those funds.\n\nJust as votes were starting to be held, however, The DAO was hacked, attacked or otherwise compromised, depending on your point of view. To some in the academic community, the early problems were obvious, and debates about their severity had already begun.\n\nBut, this all came to a halt when an individual or individuals used a valid action in the code to withdraw the funds to another DAO he or she controlled. To the ethereum platform, the action was valid to the extent it was able to be executed according to contract terms; to others who invested, it was a much more contentious action.\n\nSkipping ahead, the ethereum community eventually held a vote, with the majority of participants agreeing that they wanted to change ethereum’s code to get the funds back to investors – and away from the attacker.\n\nEnter ethereum classic\n\nWhat happened next is that a small minority disagreed with this choice, and then took action.\n\nWhile the majority argued that blockchains can and should be altered if enough people agree, other developers asserted that, in order to provide a sound history, a blockchain has to be censorship-resistant and free from tampering.\n\nSo, instead of making the switch when ethereum created an entirely new blockchain, the vocal minority continued to mine the old version of the blockchain. Effectively, ‘ethereum classic’ is a parallel version of the blockchain where funds were never returned to ether owners who lost funds in the demise of The DAO. Ethereum, by contrast, is a blockchain that has moved those funds to another address.\n\nBut this seemingly small disagreement had an outsized impact.\n\n“Ethereum Foundation responded to DAO debacle in the worst way possible,” reads the ethereum classic website, and explains further:\n\n“We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can\'t shut down, running irreversible smart contracts.”\n\nProject organizers followed up with a crypto manifesto outlining the rules that blockchains are supposed to follow in their eyes, including openness and, perhaps more vitally, immutability – the idea that once transactions are made, in this case a hack, they shouldn’t be reversed.\n\n""Not all blockchains are created equal,"" it reads.\n\nAnd by staying on the unchanged version of ethereum, they’re preserving these values.\n\nWho\'s involved in ethereum classic?\n\nThe ethereum classic team currently has four developers, according to its lead organizer, named Arvicco (he won’t reveal his identity), but theoretically, anyone can join. Just like ethereum itself, ethereum classic is supported by an open-source community.\n\nA number of notable developers have also voiced an interest in helping the ethereum classic project, including early ethereum CEO Charles Hoskinson (who left the team in 2014 over differences detailed here).\n\nWhat’s important to note, though, is the blockchain is not merely being supported for ideological reasons. A growing number of ethereum miners have devoted computational power toward the classic blockchain, seemingly, because they see a value in securing its transactions and winning the associated mining rewards.\n\nAt press time, the hash rate for the network was 544 GH/s, or about 13% of the ethereum network’s hashing power, an arguably impressive figure given that the blockchain has only been around for a matter of days.\n\nWhy is profitable?\n\nThe question of what gives classic ethers (ETC) value is still up for debate, but in short, it has value because people believe in the project, and those interested in supporting it can invest in (or speculate) on the market now that it’s listed on exchanges.\n\nSince ethereum classic is essentially a clone of the digital currency, ether holders can now make money by making an account on the ethereum classic version of the blockchain and duplicating their balance.\n\nAs ethereum classic is a replica of the original blockchain, except for a few key changes regarding The DAO transaction reversals, everyone who had tokens on ethereum at the time of the fork now has the same amount of tokens on ethereum classic. To traders, this is essentially free money.\n\nIf you owned $100 of ether at the time of the fork (when it was worth roughly $12), you’d have had about 8 ETH, which means you now have 8 ETC, or an extra $16. However, those who held more ether, now have a lot more free money.\n\nThis has since caused problems for exchanges, as, even if they don’t want to list classic ether tokens, they’re arguably holding what could be called customer funds anyway simply by possessing ether at the time of the split. But major exchanges have picked up the alternative ethereum coin, so it’s now possible to trade ETH for ETC.\n\nPoloniex, an ethereum exchange, was the first. Kraken, Shapeshift, and Bitfinex followed shortly after, meaning most of the exchanges that support ethereum now support ethereum classic.\n\nThere’s also been the opportunity for profiting by switching between currencies, and one startup founder has even wondered if this is a new way to double spend currency, a problem that the bitcoin blockchain was design to solve as it doesn’t require a central authority.\n\nWho\'s impacted?\n\nEthereum token holders on both blockchains could be affected by ""replay attacks"" if they don’t properly “separate” their addresses to differentiate them on each blockchain, which looks like a complicated process for each individual user to follow.\n\nSince, again, much of ethereum classic is the same as the old network, most users with a balance on one of them can use it on the other, but this could theoretically result in some funny mistakes, like unintentionally moving funds on one of the other networks.\n\nPoloniex has decided to automatically take precautions for its users and ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin suggested that ethereum classic update its code to solve the problem.\n\nWhat does this have to do with bitcoin?\n\nSpeaking of important takeaways, whatever happens with classic is new insight that might be used in bitcoin.\n\nThe debate around expanding bitcoin’s block size, a technical upward bound on the size of transactions that the network can support, might not seem relevant to the split, but it is.\n\nOne point Bitcoin Core developers continued to argue during the long-standing debate was that contentious hard forks are dangerous and can have unexpected consequences, such as splitting a blockchain into two competing blockchains.\n\nMany in the community, for example BitPay Co-Founder and CEO Stephen Pair, think that ethereum classic’s sudden popularity shows that these were valid concerns.\n\nAdding to the debate is that ethereum’s hard fork was immediately branded as a success by many Ethereum developers and others in the bitcoin industry. For example, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that they’re ""not something to be feared that results in multiple coins"".\n\nBut this analysis might have been premature, and he indicated as much in a new blog post.\n\nIn a weird twist, some bitcoin developers appear to support ethereum classic for this very reason, if also to demonstrate what the potential risks of switching to a new blockchain in order to update the codebase without consensus.\n\nWhat does this mean for ethereum?\n\nThe attention currently on ethereum classic could fizzle out, or it might not. Taking bitcoin classic as an example, the bitcoin classic subreddit is still active even if it never replaced bitcoin as its engineers intended.\n\nThere could be two ethereum’s that continue to develop along different paths into the future.\n\nFor now, one of them has the same functionality that ethereum is supposed to deliver, mainly smart contracts that help to construct versions of Twitter that are safe from censorship and decentralized autonomous organizations. But it’s both cheaper and more of a hassle to use without an ecosystem of developer tools built around it.\n\nEthereum itself is also impacted as some users and miners are staying on the old chain, decreasing the number of total users and the network security.\n\nNow that it’s happened though, and ethereum classic exists, the community has tons of questions. These include whether hard forking the blockchain, or rewriting the code to reverse transactions without near-unanimous consensus, is worth the risk, and if ethereum developers forked again to solve a similar problem, would it split again?\n\nEither way, it’s not clear if the rise of ethereum classic is a bad thing for the technology.\n\nThe protest blockchain gave the minority a chance to build their own system, and some people think it’s an exciting development.\n\nWhat do you think?

We’re starting with images, but eventually will work for video, music and every type of copyrighted work.”\n\nLands noted in a Medium blog that copyright is expensive, registration is time-consuming, and it historically has mainly benefited large corporations. Most artists, he stated, cannot afford to register with the U.S. Copyright Office.\n\nRegistering copyrights with Blockai is free and will remain so, Land stated.\n\nHow It Works\n\nRegistered artists can drop their creative images on the Blockai website to find out who is using their work.\n\nWhen an artist registers a copyright, Blockai writes a permanent timestamp on the bitcoin blockchain. This provides proof of publishing to protect the copyright. It provides a basis for cease and desist letters or Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) removal notices.\n\nOnce an artist registers a work, Blockai searches the web to find matches for the work to identify violations. The system will become more robust with time to support more file types. Blockai will also provide actions to take against violations.\n\nArtists will have a user profile showing all copyrights and matches. The profile will allow artists to join forces to take action against violators.\n\nAlso read: How the blockchain is changing the music business\n\nMaking Copyrights Useful\n\nBlockai’s mission is to gather all copyrighted data and make it useful. It will provide a resource to allow people to know who is the author of every file on the web and how they can pay the author.\n\nLands believes the future for creative work can be more fulfilling. Artists will be able to earn a good living by publishing to the web. Websites will profit from creative works and share earnings with artists.\n\n“We think you’ll be surprised how many places your work is mis(used) without you even knowing about it,” he noted.\n\nImages from Blockai.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Banks are not moving fast enough to adopt the Blockchain and this may lead to their quick demise. Recently in an article authored by Glen Williams, David Gunn, Eduardo Roma and Bharat Bansal, the consulting firm Bain said that banking companies are missing out on Digital Currency.\n\nIn its article Bain said about Blockchain, “Distributed ledger technology, ?rst showcased by the Bitcoin digital currency network, has the potential for such dramatic change—yet most banks have not adequately prepared for the ensuing battles to retain control of customers and of merchant payment interfaces.”\n\nBain & Company are a management consulting firm who work with top executives all over the world and help them make ‘better decisions’ and convert those decisions into actions and success.\n\nBlockchain is a rare opportunity\n\nBain & Company think that changes to ‘complex pipelines’ that make payments rarely occur.\n\nThey are of the view that removal of intermediaries, simplifying ‘connections’ between counterparties and using an immutable Blockchain holds the key to improving speed, transparency and efficiency of payments systems.\n\nThe consulting firm cities Bitcoin as a success story and mentions that since 2012 nearly US$ 1 billion in capital has been pumped into various types of distributed-ledge investments.\n\nGet ready for central bank supported digital fiat money\n\nBain hold the view that there will be a nonlinear growth in the Blockchain and they expect two waves.\n\nWave 1, according to them, would result in the development of systems which focus on international payments while Wave 2 would cause a broader disruption of domestic payments and this would be unveiled by central bank supported digital fiat currencies.\n\nBain foresee a future in which the first wave would be led by financial institutions who seek new innovations and there will be no central counterparty.\n\nHowever, when the second wave does arrive, then digital money would become a widespread phenomenon. Bain think that central banks have already started toying with the idea of all digital cash.\n\nBanks face oblivion\n\nThe effect of a central intermediary supported all digital currency would be felt deeply by the banking industry. Retail banking in particular has a lot to lose as products like credit cards and automated clearing houses risk disappearing.\n\nAt the moment banks have direct financial relationships with each other for clearing or they use a correspondent bank where such a relationship is missing. A fully digital currency would completely decimate this present arrangement.\n\nNot only would the now prevalent system face annihilation, the new digital currency would ensure that all parties can track money more effectively.\n\nThe Bain & Company article states:\n\n“By cutting the number of middlemen and enabling direct transactions between counterparties, digital ledger solutions speed up transaction times. They also ensure that each participant has a complete view of its customer accounts and balances—the key building blocks of automated payment tracking and noti?cation tools. Such improvements would go a long way to meet customer demands for a more responsive, holistic view of their ?nancial positions.”\n\nBanks are in a hard place and need to make hard choices\n\nBanks are not doing enough when it comes to distributed ledger systems. According to Bain banks lack ‘clear-eyed strategic’ plans and their ‘wait-and-see’ attitude will not work.\n\nTheir postponement of strategic decisions is likely to cost them dear. The article suggests that for super-regional banks establishing relationships with other banks and forming strategic partnerships would hold the key to success. As for global banks, they need to overcome strong organisational inertia and utilise their access to a strong IT department in their midst to use their scale for development.\n\nRegarding big banks, their article says:\n\n“Pragmatic steps entail encouraging exclusive partnerships with the most promising third-party platforms, developing systems internally, lobbying regulators to maintain the tight anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations which give incumbents an advantage over new entrants, and carefully building the credibility of distributed ledgers by migrating a portion of their existing payment ?ows to new platforms.”\n\nBanks can stay relevant\n\nBanks do hold some advantages at the moment and they can stay in the lead if they move quickly. The erosion will happen quickly though as digital payments become the norm rather than the exception.\n\nBanks therefore need to move faster to adopt digital wallets and payment applications according to Bain. They also need to use existing regulatory frameworks like AML and KYC to reinstate their positions as dominant leaders because these pose quite a barrier to new entrants.\n\nLast, but not the least, the article suggests that banks invest in startups and services related to securing digital identities. This would involve banks becoming custodians of digital keys and signatures.\n\nWhether banks will exist in the future or not all depends on how quickly they can move from steel vaults to digital vaults in a way. Inertia though may spell doom for them.', ""Bitcoin is designed as a peer-to-peer network, where nodes randomly connect to other nodes. Transactions and blocks are transmitted over this network by these nodes, until each has received all. This works quite well, as the distributed model makes Bitcoin relatively censorship-resistant; there is no central point of control to shut down or pressure into compliance.\n\nBut it also has a significant downside: The peer-to-peer network is relatively slow. As such, miners (and pools) sometimes waste hash power mining on top of an old block while a newer block is finding its way through the network. Transmission delay, therefore, benefits pooled mining as well as geographic clustering of miners, incentivizing a more centralized mining topology. This is generally considered one of the bottlenecks for scalability, as larger blocks (which can include more transactions) propagate even more slowly.\n\nOver the past years, therefore, several projects have been in development to increase the speed of block propagation. These projects focus on roughly two main issues: block compression to limit the amount of data that needs to be propagated over the network, and relay speed to cut the time it takes for blocks to propagate.\n\nThis two-part series provides an overview of these projects. Part 1 will cover block compression.\n\nHead First Mining\n\nEach Bitcoin block has a block header, which refers to all data in that block. A hash of this block header must be included in the subsequent block in order for that next block to be valid. That's how all blocks on the blockchain are chained.\n\nWhen a miner finds a block, it sends out the block header first — quickly followed by the rest of the block. This header, as well as the rest of the block, is checked for validity by receiving nodes. If valid, miners will mine “on top of” that block using the block header. The block (including the header) is also forwarded to other nodes.\n\nHead First Mining is a trick proposed by former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen. With Head First Mining, miners don’t wait for the complete block to arrive before they start mining a subsequent block. Instead, they immediately mine on top of the block header as soon as they receive it, and also forward the header to other nodes. This obviously saves time.\n\nHead First Mining does, however, have two disadvantages. First, miners don’t know for sure whether the block they are mining on top of is really valid. While the block header may appear valid (due to sufficient proof of work), the block may, for example, include invalid transactions. As such, there is a bit of risk involved in this solution. “Attacking” fellow-miners with fake blockheaders to have them waste resources is expensive, but not impossible.\n\nSecond, as a perhaps bigger disadvantage, miners have no idea which transactions are included in the block they are mining on top of. As such, the only way to ensure their subsequent block is valid, and doesn’t double-spend a transaction, is by including no transactions at all. Only after miners receive the complete block will they work on a block that does include transactions.\n\nOf course, this means that some blocks will be empty, which isn’t great for network throughput. (But if the block size can be increased as a result, it might compensate.)\n\nCompact Blocks\n\nAs seen, Bitcoin nodes typically forward each other blocks over the peer-to-peer network. Unfortunately, this can cause significant outbound bandwidth spikes each time a new block is found, which can slow down block propagation in between nodes.\n\nCompact Blocks, developed by Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo, is a trick designed to decrease data-transmission. When a new block is found, nodes initially communicate only very compact hashes of transaction data. Because nodes already received the full transaction data when it was originally sent over the network, they can use these hashes to figure out which transactions are included in the block, and reconstruct the full block themselves.\n\nBut this trick does not always work out perfectly. If a node has not yet received the initial transaction before receiving the hashes, it cannot select the corresponding transaction. Additionally, in rare cases a wrong transaction may hash into a right hash, fooling a node into believing it received the right transaction — until it tries to reconstruct the block and finds it doesn't add up.\n\nIn both these cases of failure, the node simply requests the specific transaction data after all. Even with some full transactions in them, Compact Blocks will transmit over the network much faster and require significantly less bandwidth.\n\nXtreme Thinblocks\n\nXtreme Thinblocks, an option included in Bitcoin Unlimited, is similar to Compact Blocks in many ways; for example, rather than sending all transaction data, Xtreme Thinblocks transmit more compact hashes.\n\nAs the main difference, Xtreme Thinblocks use an extra mathematical trick to communicate transaction hashes: Bloom Filters. Without going into too much detail of exactly how this trick works, Bloom Filters are compact data structures that sort of turn the Compact Blocks trick upside down. Nodes can use Bloom Filters to figure out which transactions in a block a node is missing, and request only these.\n\nWeak Blocks\n\nThus, the validity of Bitcoin blocks is, in part, determined by the block header. More specifically, the hash of this block header must start with at least a specific amount of zeroes, partly resulting from a random number (“nonce”) also included in the block header. Having the sufficient amount of zeroes “proves” that the required proof of work was done.\n\nThe specific amount of zeroes required is determined by the difficulty. So, as an example that doesn't actually translate into reality, let's say the difficulty is eight. That would mean the hash of a blockheader would need to start with eight zeroes; a hashed block header that starts with six or seven zeroes would not be valid. It would perhaps be “almost valid,” but not quite.\n\nWeak Blocks, a relatively old idea, are essentially “almost valid” blocks. They are normal blocks in every way: They include transactions and all the rest — except that the hash of its header doesn't start with enough zeroes.\n\nWeak Blocks can be useful. By transmitting Weak Blocks over the network, miners can indicate on what block they're working, and which transactions it includes.\n\nThen, when a miner does find some way to hash the block correctly, he has a valid block. And since all other miners now already know on which block that miner was working, he really needs only to transmit a minimal amount of data: a confirmation and the correct nonce. So while the total amount of data sent over the network is actually increased (as weak blocks are transmitted all the time), the relevant data to mine on top of is limited.\n\nTomorrow: On Relay: How Different Bitcoin Developers are Speeding Up the Network (Part 2)"", ""Canada’s central bank, the Bank of Canada, and five other Canadian banks (like a growing number of banks around the world) are experimenting with blockchain technology and a possible digital dollar as the growing demand for digital fintech payment systems puts the squeeze on the traditional banking sector.\n\nAt a recent IMF/World Bank conference hosted by the U.S. Federal Reserve, an estimated 90 central banks, including the Bank of Canada, came forward to talk about their research into and experiments with distributed ledger technology (DLT), the blockchain and digital currencies.\n\nThe big Canadian banks are also members of the R3 Consortium, which is working with 50 member banks worldwide, developing a foolproof methodology and standard for blockchain technologies for banks.\n\nThe Bank of Canada is cautious in commenting on its digital money experiments but is adamant that this is just an experiment and nothing more.\n\nMartin Bégin, a representative speaking for the Bank of Canada, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“What was referred to as CAD-coin is just a means of representing settlement balances on the distributed ledger, like a deposit receipt. It could also be called ‘deposit-coin’ or ‘settlement-coin.’ It doesn’t exist as a medium of exchange outside the experimental wholesale payment system. Our only goal at this stage is to understand the mechanics, limits and possibilities of this technology.”\n\nBégin said that the Bank of Canada chose to experiment with Ethereum because the members were the most familiar and experienced with coding on that platform.\n\n“This particular project is one part of a larger Bank of Canada work plan to investigate the distributed ledger technology and better understand its characteristics,” he said. “We may look at other platforms going forward.”\n\nAccording to Bégin, the greater potential for DTL lies beyond the Bitcoin blockchain, in applications outside of digital currencies.\n\n“Fintech is an important part of the Bank’s research agenda, and this not a coincidence,” he said. “There are many benefits of fintech, but realizing those, while guarding against the risks it could create, will require strong collaboration among policymakers, incumbent financial institutions and new entrants. For the Bank of Canada, one of the best ways to really understand this technology is to build and experiment with it, in conjunction with the industry. It’s our job to be forward-looking.”\n\nFintech Experts: Regulatory Uncertainty is Stifling Fintech Development in Canada\n\nMeanwhile the Canadian Money Service Business Association (CMSBA), representing more than 800 MSBs, is petitioning the federal government’s Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), the agency responsible for regulating fintech, to clearly define money services businesses to include digital currencies businesses.\n\nAmber D. Scott, CEO of Outlier Solutions, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“There are few Canadian banks that will deal with Bitcoin companies, and in some instances only if those companies are registered as MSBs with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC).”\n\nThe CMSBA sent a letter to Canada’s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) recently, saying members have had their bank accounts closed in “what appears to be a sector-wide sweep even though they are compliant with all anti-money laundering rules.”\n\nIn a regulatory Catch-22, as part of their “de-risking strategy,” banks need FINTRAC to define digital fintech startups as money services businesses before they can offer a business account.\n\n“Regulators such as FINTRAC and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) are known to have relatively negative views of MSBs (whether this is organization-wide or the bias of some examiners I cannot say),” said Scott, “which makes me wonder if the MSB designation will do more harm than good when it comes to the ability of Bitcoin companies to access the traditional financial system.\n\n“Even if our regulatory regime nets out favorably (and I hope that it does), access to banking may force companies to choose other jurisdictions. This is truly unfortunate as Canada has the potential to become a hub for fintech innovation — but we are rapidly depleting any advantages that we once had.”\n\nThe Financial Post reports that recently an unidentified bank was fined $1.1 million by FINTRAC for providing accounts to money service businesses and that an apparent crackdown is making it harder for fintech companies to get bank accounts.\n\nFINTRAC, on the other hand, is stalling on defining Bitcoin and digital currencies businesses as “Money Services Businesses” leaving the fintech startups in a Catch-22 between the banks and regulators.\n\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Kyle Kemper, Executive Director of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, noted the need for the Canadian Bitcoin community to advocate for progress. “At this point the lobby for crypto pales in comparison to the banking and payments lobby. A course of inaction could lead to a greater movement away from the fiat in general as crypto solution providers' solutions become more robust, frictionless, and adopted.”\n\nCoinbase Bumps Up Against Canada’s Regulatory Uncertainty\n\nCoinbase, one of the world’s most successful Bitcoin companies, recently notified its Canadian customers that it was withdrawing from the Canadian market and could no longer support transactions in Canadian dollars.\n\nAt the same time, the company was setting up in Japan and had recently expanded to Australia, making it the 33rd country served by Coinbase.\n\nFred Ehrsam, president and co-founder of Coinbase, said in a recent Reddit AMA:\n\n“Our mission is to create an open financial system for the world and part of that is making digital currency as easy to access, in as many countries as possible. So it makes me sad that we've had an interruption there [in Canada]. The goal is to get it back online when we have a good payment service provider or bank in Canada. A bunch proactively reached out when that news went out, so hopefully we will get a good replacement soon.”\n\n“The fact that they [Coinbase] struggle with one of the primary pillars of being an exchange, being able to process fiat withdrawals and deposits, shows that Canada is difficult environment for Bitcoin Fintech companies to operate in,” said Kemper.\n\nBank of Canada Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins noted recently that what she calls “traditional trusted intermediaries” may be replaced by more convenient technologies; however, she doesn’t believe that Canada’s regulatory body is lagging behind.\n\n“Fintech regulators also face the difficult challenge of balancing the need to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial markets against the need to encourage further innovation,” she said.\n\n“The regulatory framework needs to adapt so that the door is not opened to unmanaged financial and operational risks, unchecked critical dependencies within our financial system and moral hazard. Promoting financial stability is a core function of the Bank of Canada, and we take a system-wide perspective when we monitor risks.”\n\nAccording to Scott, however, the system is set up in such a way that many companies are having a difficult time playing by all the rules, all the time.\n\n“In many ways, the banks are acting as both gatekeepers and de facto regulators, which is truly unfortunate. We've spoken with the CEO of a company who asked a bank that had committed to investing $1 million if the bank would open a business account for them and the answer was ‘no.’ It's completely baffling to me that a bank would be willing to invest money in a business but not provide an operating account for that business.”\n\nScott noted that MSBs and fintech companies are sometimes afraid to go on record because they don't want to lose their existing bank accounts, including accounts that may have been opened covertly under the guise of software companies or numbered companies.\n\n“Banks and credit unions are afraid to open accounts or to keep them open, since they face pressure from FINTRAC and OSFI to treat all of these accounts as high risk (which is not a regulatory requirement) or to close them,” said Scott.\n\n“These tactics are directly driving risky behavior,” she added. “Ultimately, the only ones winning at this game are criminals, because legitimate businesses are being forced to act evasively, which in turn, makes illicit activity more difficult to identify.”"", 'Bitcoin price toys with gravity after a non-committal Fed rates hold.

The issue with a hard fork is, the unforecasted and unpredictable result it will bring to the network.\n\nThe Bitcoin Core developers, who have proven to be skeptical, philosophical, and confident with their technical knowledge of the network, are aware of both the negative impact a small block size could bring to the Bitcoin industry and the unpredictable nature of a hard fork.\n\nIf executed poorly, a hard fork could possibly put pressure on the Bitcoin network itself, which could potentially lead to its demise. This very reason is the motivation of Bitcoin Core developers of building various scaling technologies which could optimize the network without imposing any negative impact to it.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, including Stephen Pair, BitPay co-founder and CEO, and security engineer Stephen Cole told the community that the Bitcoin Core developers deserve credit for their approach to the blocksize debate, and their daring mentality.', 'Stephen D Palley is a lawyer in private practice in Washington, DC, focusing on construction, insurance and software development, including blockchain and smart contract design.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Palley argues that a recent court case in which bitcoin was deemed not be ""money"" has questionable precedential value despite claims to the contrary.\n\nA Miami, Florida, trial court recently dismissed a criminal case against a defendant who had sold bitcoin to a police detective as part of an undercover investigation.\n\nThe case, Florida v Espinosa, has been already been cited by some potentially important precedent for future cases, particularly those where bitcoin\'s status as ""money"" or ""currency"" is at issue. Bitcoin industry advocates will also cite the case when arguing for legislative reform and greater regulatory clarity.\n\nBut, as legal precedent, Espinosa\'s value may be limited. It’s a single decision from a Florida state court trial judge regarding state specific statutes.\n\nIt\'s not an appeals court decision. It\'s not binding ""precedent"" in any other state or in Federal Court. Half of the opinion has to do with proving criminal intent, but little to do with bitcoin.\n\nFinally, the Court’s analysis of whether bitcoin constitutes ""money"" or ""currency"" differs from approaches other courts have taken, and may (or may not) be adapted in other circumstances.\n\nThe analysis\n\nPrecedential or not, the case illustrates how courts apply well-established legal principles and procedures to new technologies. Consider how the court reached its conclusion.\n\nIt\'s a process familiar to anyone who has read a case or two. Find the facts, then apply the law, render judgment.\n\nCount I of the criminal information charged the defendant as an unlicensed ""money transmitter"" because he\'d sold bitcoin to an undercover detective for dollars.\n\nThe court dismissed these charges, holding that:\n\nThe statute didn\'t apply to a direct transaction without a ""middleman"" Bitcoin isn\'t a ""payment instrument"" The defendant wasn’t a ""money transmitter"" because he hadn’t charged a “fee"".\n\nThe first two prongs of the analysis involve fairly standard statutory analysis (""the law says this"", ""the alleged conduct is this"", ""therefore the law does/does not apply."")\n\nThe third prong is a bit more elaborate.\n\nCiting case law, the court reasoned that to be a ""money transmitting business"", a fee must be charged. While the defendant made a profit (in bitcoin) on his sale, the court held that a cryptocurrency ""profit"" isn\'t a fee. According to the court, to qualify as a fee, a payment must be made in fiat money.\n\nIn support of this conclusion, the court observed that ""bitcoin has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money"".\n\nThis last point is not one that all courts have accepted, and it’s a somewhat surprising conclusion. (See SEC v. Shavers, in which the Court held bitcoin ""is a currency or form of money"" for purposes of determining whether or not security in under Federal Securities laws).\n\nThe charges\n\nThe court also dismissed two counts of money laundering, holding that the defendant didn\'t have the kind of criminal intent required by the applicable Florida statute.\n\nAn undercover detective told the defendant that the purchased bitcoin would be used for an illegal purpose. The court said that this wasn\'t enough to meet intent requirements under the Florida money laundering statute, which the court court also said was too vaguely written to apply under the facts of this case.\n\nThe court says that anything can be used for money-laundering, including bitcoin. It just happens that there wasn\'t enough evidence of the defendant’s criminal intent, and (according the court), the word ""promote"" in the statute wasn\'t clear enough.\n\nGiven slightly different circumstances (or a different judge) a different outcome isn’t hard to imagine.\n\nSelling something for a profit with the express knowledge that a third party will use it to commit a crime (and the intent to help them commit it) could be problematic, depending on the facts and jurisdiction.\n\nA defendant might risk being charged as ""accessory before the fact"", among other things. Other courts, in other circumstances, have rejected the notion that bitcoin\'s status as a virtual currency is so unique as to protect a criminal defendant from conviction.\n\nPrecedent unclear\n\nIn this respect, Espinosa is also consistent with the court\'s decision in the Silk Road case, in which the defendant didn\'t make out as well, but where the court says that bitcoin use in and of itself isn\'t a problem — it\'s ""how"" you use it. The same seems to be the case here.\n\nIt’s just that the court didn’t think that Mr Espinosa had done anything wrong. Will Espinosa prove to be important or persuasive authority in the future? It\'s too soon to say.\n\nFor now, it\'s a fine example of law\'s adaptability and the power that judges and lawyers have to shape it.\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

07/29/2016,"['The unintended consequences of the ethereum hard fork continued to mount this week as new problems became apparent due to the ongoing popularity of two competing networks.\n\nA week ago, there was one ethereum, a decentralized computing platform that’s drawn outside attention for applying the cryptocurrency concept to develop new Internet applications. But due to a schism in how people think the platform should work, there are now two ethereum networks (ethereum and ethereum classic), both of which use an almost identical history.\n\nThe thinking was one blockchain \'winner\' would quickly emerge and that the other would eventually fall to the wayside. However, both have continued to exist despite these predictions.\n\nAt issue is that, by having two separate networks with two separate blockchains, anyone who held funds in the first iteration (ethereum) is now the owner of funds on the second (ethereum classic). Complicating matters is that, for users, both their ETH funds on ethereum and ETC funds on ethereum classic have the same address and private keys.\n\nThe present conditions have set the stage for ""replay attacks"".\n\nIn computer science terms, this simply means a network action that is repeated that isn’t supposed to be. In digital currency terms, when someone broadcasts a transaction using one of the networks, there is a risk that that transaction gets included in both blockchains.\n\nThis means users who try to buy ETH today won’t be affected, but anyone who had funds in any contract prior to the fork was essentially duplicated on the other fork.\n\nEthereum developer Zsolt Felföldi, who works on the platform’s Go implementation, explained that this shouldn’t happen if both networks were taking proper precautions.\n\n""Separating these two networks was never really planned,"" he said.\n\nGiven the attention paid to ethereum by major banks and financial professionals, the incident has caught the interest of even those outside the open-source blockchain community. To these observers, the situation appears to be a crossroads of indecision.\n\nIBM blockchain leader of the Latin American division Martin Hagelstrom told CoinDesk:\n\n""The problem is that changing these rules imply making a new hard fork. So ethereum is saying [ethereum classic] should do it. And the classic guys are saying that [ethereum creator] Vitalik [Buterin] should have considered it on their hard fork, so they should do it.""\n\nNeither ethereum nor ethereum classic seemed to prepare for the attacks, but the resulting gap in communications means that neither side is really pursuing action.\n\n""They are acting like kids if you ask me,"" Hagelstrom added.\n\n\'Attack\' semantics\n\nUsers on both the ETC and ETH networks are vulnerable to the “attack,” though there is even disagreement about whether this is an accurate way to describe what’s going on.\n\nFor one, it\'s unclear whether users could fall into one category or the other, unless they opted out of one network for ideological reasons and chose to sell their ETH or ETC.\n\nFelföldi described it as a necessary inconvenience:\n\n""I wouldn’t say the replay problem is quite an ‘attack’ because this is just something that happens always. No one does this maliciously, I think. This is just some inconvenience. The network wasn’t designed for this situation.""\n\nThe biggest risk may be that users ""lose"" funds by intending to execute a contract with ETH, and by virtue of the address and private key similarities, end up sending ETC as well.\n\nShould this account not be accessible to the user, this could mean additional value is lost in a manner that wasn’t intended.\n\nExchange impact\n\nAt present, it appears that exchanges have been most affected by the vulnerability.\n\nFor example, at one time, traders seemed to be using Coinbase’s exchange as a vehicle to get ""free"" ETC. The steps required to do game the exchange are public, and people appear to be using them. Whether this particular attack vector might have been resolved is unclear, but signs on social media suggest that users have been able to withdraw both currencies today.\n\nCoinbase was unavailable for comment at press time.\n\nIn a blog post, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong claims that the exchange anticipated the replay attacks, but didn’t expect ethereum classic to be so popular. He claims that they then ""began work to nullify the replay attacks.""\n\nEarlier this week, Coinbase announced that it doesn\'t plan to support ethereum classic, whether on its wallet service or its new exchange GDAX.\n\nIt’s unclear whether this is ongoing, and if it is, who\'s paying for it, because it might not even be the exchange.\n\nCoinbase doesn’t appear to be guarding against it, although it’s hard to tell. Coinbase’s Charlie Lee said via Slack that the Ethereum Foundation advised the payment processor not to guard against the replay attacks.\n\nCoinbase, however, isn\'t the only exchange impacted.\n\nIn a message posted to the exchange’s website this week, BTC-e staff indicated that its ETC holdings had been drained when users transferred their funds to Poloniex, and went as far as declaring that “ethereum classic in the current circumstances is a scam”.\n\nChina-based exchange Yunbi said in blog post earlier this week that it had lost 40,000 ETC due to the replay vulnerability. The exchange said that it would effectively eat the losses and pay out ETC balances corresponding to user ETH balances.\n\nFuture fix unclear\n\nSo how do ethereum users and exchanges guard against it?\n\nOne way to get around the risk is to run a transaction through an open-source ""splitter contract"", effectively moving ETC to a new account. But this is pretty burdensome as it’s dependent on each exchange or each individual to do for every account that they have.\n\nPoloniex automatically generates new addresses for users so that they can avoid unintentionally sending their ETH or ETC in the mirrored process. Kraken did the same, claiming that if users don’t ""split"" their ETH and ETC, they can still deposit ETH at the exchange and receive ETH and ETC in their account.\n\nIt’s possible to stop this across the network wholesale, rather than trusting exchanges to pull through. If either network incorporated the fix by hard forking their network to update the transaction formats, they could resolve this problem, but neither has expressed plans to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, Felföldi mentioned that ethereum does eventually want to update the network to resolve the problem by incorporating the necessary change to the transaction formats in Metropolis, the next version of ethereum, which is due in fall 2016.\n\nThe worry is that changing it earlier than that would require yet another hard fork, or moving to a new blockchain, but people are afraid it will be one fork too many.\n\n""We just did one fork. We don’t want to do any more rash updates because it’s dangerous,"" he said. ""It will probably be here for quite some time.""\n\nClassic project manager Arvicco said that, in his view, the responsibility for resolving the relay vulnerability falls on those who executed the split in the first place.\n\n""The facts are clear, ethereum classic is still keeping a consensus of original legacy network, while those following forked ethereum left this consensus,"" he told CoinDesk, going on to argue:\n\n""For the ones forking off (leaving consensus), it stands to reason that they are liable to institute a clean split, and not expect to push the burden to the ones still in consensus.""\n\nOthers see the situation persisting because of these entrenched positions.\n\nPeter Vessenes, security expert and Bitcoin Foundation founder, said:\n\n""Creating chaos is clearly a goal for some participants.""\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Fueling this next stage of tech innovation is an online transactional network known as “The Blockchain,” which is the subject of the freshly-minted book, Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business, and the World.\n\nAuthored by Don and Alex Tapscott, a Canadian father-son duo, this 368-page page-turner skillfully captures the blockchain’s arrival as a transformative worldwide platform, offering what is arguably the first comprehensive look at the future of this emerging digital ecosystem.\n\nDon Tapscott’s reputation as a thought leader on the future of technology was solidified in 2006 with the release of his bestseller, Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything. It offered a detailed look at the internet’s role in facilitating mass collaboration. Now through a joint effort with his son Alex, who is the founder and CEO of a consulting firm for emerging technology companies, Blockchain Revolution delivers an informed look at the transformative influence of this technology on the evolving political, economic and social world order.\n\nThe book attempts to strike a delicate balance between what could be described as tech utopianism and the real-world optimism often espoused by those touting blockchains’ immense potential. The first part of the book introduces blockchain technology: an esoteric concept best defined as a highly-secure digital ledger to facilitate currency and other transactions. Known best as the engine that supports the digital currency bitcoin, the blockchain’s potential for recording virtually everything under the sun — artwork, birth certificates, medical records, land titles and much more — is gaining worldwide attention.\n\nThe second part of the book dives deep into the reinvention and new business models fostered by the infusion of blockchain solutions in financial services, the Internet of Things, entrepreneurship and the music industry among many others. And in the closing, a sobering tale looks at the 10 major challenges to implementation.\n\nReaders will hone their knowledge of terms like cryptocurrency, blockchain transaction, mining and smart contracts, and will hear names like Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees, Andreas Antonopoulos, Vitalik Buterin — the prominent early pioneers and entrepreneurs in the blockchain world. (Oddly missing from this list is Jesse Powell, founder of Kraken, arguably the world’s largest blockchain-based cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in San Francisco. At age 27, he established the nonprofit Verge Center for the Arts in Sacramento.)\n\nThose enamored with the transformative impact of new technologies like the blockchain will find this book fascinating. At times it takes on a utopian ideal, but it’s equally grounded in exquisitely-researched information. The book has attracted the interest of both revolutionaries and traditionalists across industries. It explores the concept of “smart contracts,” that allows for the execution of agreed-upon transactions and instructions without the need for third-party intermediaries. Blockchain’s overriding philosophy is to transform the hierarchical, highly centralized command-and-control models that have been rendered inefficient by the changing times.\n\nThe book offers a peek at who’s actually exploring and using Blockchain technology today — a list that includes AirBNB, Deloitte, USAA and IBM. It also highlights how financial firms like Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have been particularly active in vetting the technology to identify applications that can deliver faster and more secure transactions at a lower cost.\n\nBlockchain Revolution is a “non-technical” read though, and ideally suited for neophytes seeking to understand the basic properties behind what the blockchain is, what it’s not and what it hopes to become.\n\nPraise aside, Blockchain Revolution is not without its detractors, many of which come from a blockchain or cryptocurrency community notoriously harsh in its delivery of constructive feedback. One Amazon reviewer wrote of how the book is “nothing but a collection of arbitrary lists, allusions to things tangentially-related to Blockchain technology and opinions presented as fact.” Another described the book as “a heap of ideas about how bitcoin will change the world, seen through rose-colored glasses.”\n\nWhen charting new territory, it’s not uncommon for pioneering thought leaders like the Tapscotts to endure some challenging feedback. Nevertheless, the inevitability of blockchains game-changing impact cannot be minimized: Co-author Alex Tapscott says that a new technology like blockchain is something to be achieved, but not necessarily predicted.\n\n“People often overestimate the effect of technology in the short term but drastically underestimate it in the long-term,” Alex Tapscott says. “My hope is that we’ll look back on this first generation of the blockchain revolution as the period where we harnessed a powerful technology for securing a fair, thriving and prosperous future for all.”', 'Digital currency exchange and wallet provider Coinbase has extended bitcoin and ether buying to customers in Canada and Singapore, within days after announcing the same feature to Australian users.\n\nFirmly in its global expansion phase, bitcoin and ether exchange and wallet Coinbase has now enabled its bitcoin and ether buying feature to customers in Canada and Singapore.\n\nUsers in the two countries will be able to purchase the cryptocurrencies instantly with their debit and credit cards.\n\nCanadian users will be restricted to buying bitcoin and ether while not being to sell them just yet, similar to their counterparts in Australia. As with Australia, Coinbase says its working toward the selling option and can be expected to be made available soon.\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase will stop supporting CAD services in Canada including EFT transfers, CAD storage on Coinbase and Interac transfers due to the unexpected shutdown of its payments provider Vogogo. Coinbase’s CAD services in Canada will cease to exist as of August 1. Today, July 29, would be the last day for Canadian users to freely withdraw CAD from their Coinbase accounts, or convert them to bitcoin and ether.\n\nAlso read: Coinbase Enables Digital Currency Buying in Australia\n\nAltogether, Coinbase’s expansion effort sees its presence in a total of 33 countries. The San Francisco-based bitcoin company is predominantly available in countries across Europe. Australia and Singapore are the two countries where Coinbase exists in the eastern hemisphere. Singapore is currently the only Asian country on that list.\n\nThat might soon change however, following a recent investment round that saw Coinbase gain an investment and a partnership with Japan’s largest bank by assets, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BMTU). Coinbase has raised $10.5 million from investors in an effort to launch its services in Japan.\n\nFeatured image from Coinbase.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The end of anonymity for Bitcoin users may be fast approaching as the EU has put forth a proposal that would require anyone using the cryptocurrency in the member states to register on a database.\n\nThe European Commission (EC) is behind the push to take away anonymity from Bitcoin and other virtual currencies with the hope that this could help prevent a number of crimes that use digital wallets as a means of avoiding a paper trail. The proposal would require all users of the cryptocurrency to register using their real-world identity and to provide the addresses of the virtual wallets containing their funds.\n\nSince Bitcoin is untraceable by nature, cybercriminals have embraced the virtual currency to commit cybercrime. This is especially so with ransomware where users often have to pay using cryptocurrency to unlock their files after falling victim to an attack. The global rise in this form of malware has affected individuals, companies, and even governments, which is why the EU is willing to do anything in its power to prevent it from becoming a larger problem than it already is.\n\nThe EU is currently working on reforming its Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD) and has decided to add a database of cryptocurrency users to it in order to prevent criminals from laundering money in an untraceable way via the internet. It has been quite difficult for governments to include cryptocurrency into their laws as this nascent technology is rarely recognized as actual money by financial institutions.\n\nThe latest version of the AMLD will recognize virtual currencies as money and its database will remove the anonymity that those employing it for nefarious purposes have hid behind for some time. The companies that provide digital currency wallets will also be held accountable to require that users in the EU register using their real information.\n\nThe proposal is expected to be voted upon by the European parliament before the end of 2016.\n\nPublished under license from ITProPortal.com, a Net Communities Ltd Publication.

Transactions and blocks are transmitted over this network by these nodes, until each has received all. This works quite well, as the distributed model makes Bitcoin relatively censorship-resistant; there is no central point of control to shut down or pressure into compliance.\n\nBut it also has a significant downside: The peer-to-peer network is relatively slow. As such, miners (and pools) sometimes waste hash power mining on top of an old block while a newer block is finding its way through the network. Transmission delay, therefore, benefits pooled mining as well as geographic clustering of miners, incentivizing a more centralized mining topology. This is generally considered one of the bottlenecks for scalability, as larger blocks (which can include more transactions) propagate even more slowly.\n\nOver the past years, therefore, several projects have been in development to increase the speed of block propagation. These projects focus on roughly two main issues: block compression to limit the amount of data that needs to be propagated over the network, and relay speed to cut the time it takes for blocks to propagate.\n\nThis two-part series provides an overview of these projects. Part 1 covered block compression. Part 2 will examine ways of speeding up the network.\n\nFast Relay Network (AKA Matt Corallo's Relay Network)\n\nThe Fast Relay Network, also known as Matt Corallo's Relay Network, is a relatively straightforward relay network setup by Corallo, and has existed for some years. The Fast Relay Network consists of nine nodes, distributed strategically around the globe. Designed as a hub-and-spoke model, miners can connect to the relay node closest to them to send and receive blocks over this network. This is significantly faster than Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network.\n\nThe main downside of the Fast Relay Network is that it's relatively centralized: Corallo controls it. And while the software is open source, no one else has set up a similar open relay network so far. (Though mining pools do have similar — but closed — setups among themselves, and typically for “internal” use among their own nodes.)\n\nFor more details, see Bitcoin Magazine's earlier article on the Fast Relay Network.\n\nFalcon\n\nAs blocks are transferred over Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, they are really transmitted in several IP-packets. Each node on the network receives each packet, and reconstructs blocks from the data in these different packets. Once the block is reconstructed and considered valid, nodes forward the block to other nodes. Again, of course, in different packets.\n\nTo speed this process up, Cornell University researchers Soumya Basu, Ittay Eyal and Emin Gün Sirer are developing the Falcon relay network. Falcon uses a technique called “cut-through routing,” where nodes don't wait to receive all packages to forward them. Instead, they forward each package as soon as they receive it, while initially checking only the block header. They reconstruct the block in the meantime, as the rest of the packages arrive.\n\nThis solution does have one disadvantage: Nodes can validate a full block only after they have received all required packages. As such, there's a small risk of a dishonest miner transmitting invalid packages all across the network, wasting competitor resources.\n\nTo solve this, the Falcon network operates with gatekeepers: the Cornell University team. As such, the Falcon network itself isn't entirely decentralized; the idea is that it decentralizes Bitcoin's overall network topology through diversity.\n\nFIBRE\n\nAs noted, blocks on the Bitcoin network are really transmitted in several IP-packets. Unfortunately, package-loss is a significant bottleneck for propagation speed; even on relay networks. While it doesn’t necessarily happen very often, packet-loss can cause spikes in transmission-time, as nodes need to re-communicate data.\n\nFIBRE (Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine), also developed by Corallo, is a re-designed relay-protocol. As perhaps its most interesting solution, it is built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This is an alternative to the far more common TCP internet protocol, and currently mostly used for Voice over IP (Skype) and gaming. As an important differentiator from all the above protocols, UDP allows FIBRE to use a nifty trick known as Forward Error Correction (FEC). This lets nodes reconstruct all of the transmitted data even if some of it got lost on the way.\n\nAnd: FIBRE is specifically designed for Compact Blocks; the innovation discussed in Part 1 of this series. The combination of FIBRE with Compact Blocks, as statistics collected by Corallo show, make FIBRE nearly as fast as the speed of light.\n\nLastly, FIBRE is designed to be a more decentralized alternative to other relay networks. Specifically, as a key feature of FIBRE, it's designed as a sort of “add on” for Bitcoin Core, so anyone who runs a node should be able set up his or her own network."", ""Bitcoin was designed as an anonymous and decentralized currency. But transactions are never truly anonymous, as they are recorded and available on the Blockchain — the distributed ledger which keeps a record of every Bitcoin transaction.\n\nWhen you use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services, you need to provide your name and address to the seller for delivery purposes. This means that a third party can trace your transactions and find ID information. This is the reason why there are such services as Bitcoin mixer, for example, which allows you to exchange your Bitcoins for different ones which cannot be associated with the original owner.\n\nMartin Albert, Bitalo Owner, explains to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“You cannot overcome the general principles of the Bitcoin network, that means in the end you can only make it very complicated to track individual coins, but still you can track every coin back to the block where the coin was mined.”\n\nWhat is CryptoMixer?\n\nOne of these platforms is CryptoMixer and its spokesperson tells CoinTelegraph:\n\n“We do not track the source of funds’ services. The one who has signed the transaction is considered to be a valid owner of the coins. The thing we are responsible for is providing you with good and secured mixing algorithms and making your experience fast and reliable.”\n\nCryptoMixer is rather different from Bitmixer; it has a mobile version of the website and an attractive affiliate program. It is also preparing to launch an Altcoin mixing feature.\n\nThe spokesperson says:\n\n“We are already on an internal test phase — it is what everybody was asking us to do and we did it, although I'm sure we’re not the only ones. Anyway, we believe it is always good for the market when there are several players. We think that customers always win when they have a choice.”\n\nSolving privacy issues\n\nWhy should you use a Bitcoin mixer tool, if you don’t have any legal concerns? Well, the Blockchain doesn’t allow transactions to be traced but it makes it possible to see the amount of coins that are currently stored on your Bitcoin address. Thus, if you prefer not to show how many Bitcoins you have, a Bitcoin mixer looks like a good solution for privacy-related issues.\n\nAccording to Michael Dalesandro, RockitCoin CEO, a Bitcoin mixer could be very useful:\n\n“It’s interesting because on the surface you could say there is no reason for it, but you only need to look at the stock market to see its potential. You don’t know the individual or firm’s name buying or selling stock, you only know the clearing firm's name. So, if you were Carl Icahn buying a large position you would not want anyone to know. It is the concept of being more anonymous.”\n\nMixer and the block size debate\n\nBut the block size limit of the Bitcoin network makes mixing more expensive.\n\nAlbert explains:"", 'The controversy surrounding the level of moderation in the /r/Bitcoin subreddit has been a huge topic of conversation in the Bitcoin community ever since the release of Bitcoin XT, which is software — originally maintained by former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn — intended to hard fork the Bitcoin blockchain for the purpose of increasing the block size limit. Some have claimed the comments and posts removed from /r/Bitcoin amount to censorship, while others claim the moderators of that subreddit are free to curate the content as they see fit.\n\nAnother subreddit, /r/btc, was popularized by Bitcoin angel investor Roger Ver and others in the aftermath of the controversy surrounding /r/Bitcoin’s handling of Bitcoin XT. Some prefer this secondary subreddit, while others prefer the curated style of /r/Bitcoin.\n\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman recently chatted with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong at the company’s San Francisco headquarters. The two executives discussed /r/Bitcoin, a possible subreddit moderator removal process, and Reddit’s potential use of Bitcoin.\n\nArmstrong’s Issues with /r/Bitcoin\n\nArmstrong’s issues with /r/Bitcoin are well documented. In late 2015, a tweet from Armstrong about Coinbase testing Bitcoin XT was removed from /r/Bitcoin. This move from the /r/Bitcoin moderators was in line with this policy:\n\n“Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.”\n\nA month earlier, Armstrong had announced that he unsubscribed from /r/Bitcoin and subscribed to /r/btc on Twitter.\n\n“We’ve emailed about this once or twice, but there’s a lot of censorship happening [on /r/Bitcoin],” said Armstrong during his fireside chat with Huffman.\n\nArmstrong then briefly mentioned the lead moderator of /r/Bitcoin, “His username is Theymos — if you want to ban him.”\n\nA Way to Replace Subreddit Moderators\n\nAfter sharing his issues with /r/Bitcoin, Armstrong asked Huffman if there have ever been discussions within Reddit regarding the replacement of moderators in certain situations. “There are a lot of product decisions that we made over the years that — we didn’t consider at the time the long term implications of them,” said Huffman. “The moderator hierarchy situation . . . is one of them.”\n\nHuffman then noted that Reddit often sees moderators of some subreddits behaving in a way that goes against the company’s own inclination to let things play out and generally be open. “We’ve seen that with the Bitcoin community,” he added. “I don’t disagree with you at all. Right now, our opinion is that we try to stay hands-off unless they’re breaking other, site-wide rules. That said, we have put a lot of thought into these issues. What is the best way to appoint new moderators [and] and remove old ones in a way that the communities can do themselves?”\n\nHuffman discussed other issues with the way Reddit is structured too. He noted that subreddits have value in a way not dissimilar from domain names, but they’re also free to claim. Huffman also wants to find way to make it easier for new communities to grow and allow existing communities to revolt.\n\nIn terms of the company’s governance structure, Huffman noted that Reddit acts like the federal government, while each subreddit acts as a state.\n\nUpdate on Reddit’s Potential Use of Bitcoin\n\nIn addition to the discussions regarding /r/Bitcoin and subreddit moderators, Huffman also talked about Reddit’s possible future integration of Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency. Reddit was thinking about giving away shares of the company to their users via a crypto-asset in late 2014, but Huffman revealed that there isn’t a way to do this in a practical, legal way.\n\nHaving said that, Huffman still wants to figure out a way to reward their users with real, monetary value. “Cryptocurrencies are a nice way to do that because you remove some of the geographical issues,” he added.\n\nFormer Reddit Cryptocurrency Engineer Ryan X.

Logically, the more actors there are, the more the assumption stands. However, numerous bitcoin developers, including Gregory Maxwell, Peter Todd, Luke-Jr and others, have stated that bitcoin mining is centralized in two or three individuals.\n\nThe invention of ASICs, in combination with economies of scale (although some research suggests after a certain point – around 25% – it becomes more economical to have less hashing power) has led to giant mining farms in remote areas of China where electricity is cheap, making Bitcoin mining highly profitable. It is, however, much more profitable to be rewarded for mining, through blocks or fees, rather than maliciously attack the network, but the option is there and facts can change.\n\nA new paper [PDF] from university researchers based in Shanghai and Virginia claims to have a solution which secures the network even if 51% of miners are malicious. The highly technical paper, extending more than 30 pages, opens by stating:\n\n“On top of Bitcoin’s brilliant ideas of utilizing the power of the honest miners, via their computing power together with blocks, to secure the blockchain, we further leverage the power of the honest users, via their coins together with transactions, to achieve this goal.”\n\nThat is, a second layer is added to proof of work via coin-voting, otherwise known as proof of stake. The paper analyses proof-of-stake implementations, the “nothing at stake” problem and the many proposed solutions, including Ethereum’s Casper. The researchers conclude that Casper uses a random number generator which “is an extractor based on the previous state of the blockchain, with entropy sourced from missing block propositions.” It is, therefore, manipulatable, according to the study.\n\nMoreover, they argue that the current proof of stake implementations require coins to be locked:\n\n“If a validator set is too big then most of the coins are immovable and sadly misses the point of currency, but if the set is too small, then an adversary with a meager sum of coins could halt consensus.”\n\nThe proposed solution is not to lock coins, but to ask transacting users to vote on the best blockchain:\n\n“A possible way for an honest user to [support the best chain] is to include the user’s best available blockchain as part of the transaction; this transaction is then signed by the user and bound to the user’s current best available blockchain. When this transaction is broadcast into the network, all miners are informed with the user’s best choice of blockchain. After collecting all users’ best choices, miners will be able to derive and extend the best blockchain.”\n\nThe researchers claim that this hybrid solution protects from both malicious stakeholders, as there would be the proof of work aspect and malicious miners as there would be the proof of stake aspect. However, It is not clear whether this proposed solution would work.

07/30/2016,"[""After the successful execution of the Ethereum network’s first hard fork, mainstream media outlets, including the Huffington Post, criticized the supporters of Ethereum Classic, calling the project aimed to maintain the original chain of Ethereum “another Bitcoin scam.”\n\nDavid Seaman, the author of an article entitled “‘Ethereum Classic,’ Another Bitcoin Scam,” laid out a series of irrational arguments to supposedly prove the invalidity of Ethereum Classic, both philosophically and economically.\n\nBecause some people lost too much money?\n\nThe first argument presented was the justification of the formation of Ethereum Classic after the completion of the Ethereum network’s hard fork which was supported by the community.\n\nFirstly, the Ethereum hard fork was supported by a section of the community, not the community as a whole. Stampery, a Blockchain-based notarization platform provider, offers a simple explanation of their support for Ethereum Classic.\n\nStampery summarized:\n\n“For transactions to be final and unmodifiable, Blockchains need to be immune to third-party interference. This promise was completely broken by Ethereum. Hard forks should only happen when a catastrophic bug put the core values of the technology in danger. In this case the consensus mechanism worked just fine. The Blockchain was modified simply because a group of people lost too much money and they decided to bail themselves out.”\n\nDangerous precedent\n\nThe Ethereum hard fork presented a dangerous precedent for all digital currencies and the Blockchain-based network because it showed central authorities the possibility of intervention. Since the Ethereum foundation pushed a hard fork solely for the benefit of a certain party, governments can demand a similar request to change anchored data on the Blockchain.\n\nA similar point was made by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell immediately after the hard fork. Maxwell emphasized that the hard fork harms the reputation of cryptocurrency because it hints at the possibility of legal intervention.\n\n“It's a bad idea which will harm the reputation of cryptocurrency in general and potentially fuel adverse legal/regulatory intervention,” he stated.\n\nDestroying the remaining dignity\n\nSeaman and his article from the Huffington Post additionally went on to criticize the Bitcoin community and network, suggesting that the support from the Bitcoin community towards Ethereum shows that Bitcoin is in a weak position.\n\nSeaman says:\n\n“The trolls and narrow-minded Bitcoin bagholders pushing Ethereum “Classic” on an unsuspecting public are not the ultimate reason I’m selling off much of my Bitcoin tonight - that’s just another indication to me that Bitcoin is in a weak position.”\n\nAlthough every individual is entitled to their own beliefs, the concept of decentralization which the Ethereum foundation and community advertised has been broken due to the execution of hard fork.\n\nThe mainstream media’s irrational criticism towards the Bitcoin community is destroying the remaining dignity of the Ethereum foundation and community."", 'At the annual Digital Payments Conference held at the Meikles Hotel Zimbabwe on July 28, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) warned the country’s citizens against the various risks involved in using Bitcoin.\n\nThe central bank’s Senior Executive of the National Payment Systems department Josephat Mutepfa, told the event’s audience—which primarily consisted of financial startups, experts, and entrepreneurs—that despite the popularity of Bitcoin, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe discourages the use of Bitcoin. This is due to the lack of regulatory frameworks for exchanges and startups providing digital currency related financial services.\n\nWhile economic benefits of using digital currencies such as Bitcoin are evident to the central bank, the organization believes that any type of unregulated alternatives must be approached with caution, even if it provides the unbanked an opportunity to regain financial control.\n\nMutepfa specifically identified some Bitcoin startups including Bitmari, a company which enables Zimbabweans to send money across other countries in Africa, at substantially lower costs by using Bitcoin.\n\nIncrease in Mobile Transactions\n\nThe concern of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is justifiable, mainly because the government lacks the necessary information to fully understand and regulate digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to various statistics however, the rapid growth of the Bitcoin industry and market in countries like Zimbabwe seems inevitable. A recent study released by the multi-billion dollar auditing company KPMG demonstrates an unprecedented level of development in the mobile payment space in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSince 2014, nearly 95% of Zimbabweans have used mobile money to pay utility bills and the mobile money account penetration rate in 2014 was estimated at 25%, which was higher than the bank account penetration rate in the country.\n\nThis major shift in trend from banking services to mobile payments demonstrates the financial issues that the majority of the Zimbabwean population struggle to deal with when using banking products and services.\n\nTo obtain a bank account, an individual must provide a list of documents and evidence of a stable fixed income, which many people in Zimbabwe fail to offer. Thus, bank services are limited to a closed group of members in the society. When this financial isolation occurs, naturally, Zimbabweans search for alternatives and one of the most easily obtainable and accessible financial payment method is Bitcoin.\n\nThe central bank’s discouragement of the use of Bitcoin due to the lack of regulatory frameworks for digital currencies can be observed as the government’s ignorance towards the unbanked population.', 'What does Ethereum do better than its pre-crypto equivalent?

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Ethereum Classic is dominating the cryptocurrency news cycle. After a slumber of some days following the Ethereum hard fork that refunded investors of the hacked DAO, the unforked and re-named Ethereum blockchain and its native token classic ether (ETC) surged. Exchanges enabled trade in the digital currency, investors bought in, miners pointed their hardware to it, and a new development community began to form.\n\nBut Ethereum Classic also has led to chaos and uncertainty. The forked half of the chain — sometimes dubbed “Ethereum One,” and supported by the Ethereum Foundation — is still running as well. Ethereum has, therefore, effectively split into two networks. An unprecedented situation in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe question on everybody's mind is, therefore: How will this end?\n\nIn this three-part series, Bitcoin Magazine provides an overview of some of the scenarios that circulate throughout the different Ethereum communities and the wider blockchain industry.\n\nPart 1 of this series covered how the great Ethereum schism can end relatively well for Ethereum One (but not so much for Ethereum Classic).\n\nIn Part 2: How the great Ethereum schism can end relatively well for Ethereum Classic (but not so much for Ethereum One).\n\nAuthor’s note: Not all scenarios or nuances may be accounted for, nor does inclusion in this list — or order thereof — say anything about likelihood.\n\nScenario 4: Ethereum Classic Overtakes (or Catches Up With) Ethereum One\n\nEthereum Classic may continue growing to the point where it catches up with, or overtakes, Ethereum One by market share and hash power. While this was originally a long-term plan at best for the Ethereum Classic community, the recent surge suggests it might happen much sooner than anyone expected.\n\nThis scenario could play out in several ways. Here are more sub-scenarios.\n\nPerhaps Ethereum Classic draws in a whole new set of users that were never interested in Ethereum before. This could happen for multiple reasons. With the removal of a (perceived) central point of control — the Ethereum Foundation — Ethereum Classic seems to have attracted a new wave of interest already. Meanwhile, Ethereum Classic is cheaper to use than Ethereum One. And its dedication to censorship-resistance and immutability may attract a certain class of users and use-cases as well - especially since all properties of Ethereum One should be offered as well. And, of course, there may be other reasons.\n\nOr, perhaps more and more Ethereum One users will switch back to Ethereum Classic. This could also happen for several reasons. It's very unclear, for example, how much support the hard fork ever really had; this support may have been severely overstated. And even if the hard fork had much support before it happened, users may reassess their original position now that they are no longer financially invested in The DAO. Perhaps more of them will come to agree that immutability is a vital property of a blockchain, or that the Ethereum Foundation represents a single point of failure. Or maybe the Ethereum Foundation will make more controversial decisions, driving users away. And again, there may be other reasons.\n\nThere are also different possible outcomes if Ethereum Classic overtakes Ethereum One.\n\nFirst of all: Ethereum One software clients will not automatically switch back to the (original) Ethereum Classic chain if it ever becomes the chain with the most proof of work. (This is also referred to as the “longest” chain — though it's not really about length.) There would still be two separate chains, with two distinct currencies.\n\nRegardless, more users may consider Ethereum Classic the “real” Ethereum from that moment on. Before and shortly after the hard fork, many proponents of the hard fork maintained that the “real” Ethereum would be the one with longest chain. If Ethereum Classic overtakes Ethereum One, by their own logic these users would have to switch back. (Or they would have to re-think their position on what determines the “real” Ethereum.)\n\nEither way, Ethereum inventor and project lead Vitalik Buterin — on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation — has committed to work on the Ethereum One project. Assuming he does, the Ethereum Classic project could still copy code from Ethereum One, even if Ethereum One is much smaller. While it may be strange for the most important developers to primarily develop for a minority chain, it does not have to be a fundamental problem.\n\nIt is also possible, though, that the Ethereum Classic project develops a more distinct technological vision over time. In that case, Ethereum Classic and Ethereum One could copy code from each other — and reject what they don't like.\n\nScenario 5: Ethereum One Splinters\n\nAs mentioned in Part 1 of this series, now that they appear viable, Ethereum coin-splits may happen more often. And, of course, that’s not only true for Ethereum Classic; Ethereum One may experience further splintering as well.\n\nThis scenario would closely resemble the scenario where Ethereum Classic splinters, except that it would be the Ethereum One community that branches out, or both Ethereum Classic and Ethereum One do. Perhaps in such a way that there will be no clear “main chain” at all. Instead, all different Ethereum projects could co-exist much like different altcoins do today (not counting Bitcoin.) They would vary in size and popularity over time, providing for different use-cases, with no clear winner.\n\nScenario 6: Only Ethereum Classic Lives On, Ethereum One Fails\n\nAs a sixth scenario, Ethereum Classic may not only overtake Ethereum One, but essentially “defeat” the fork attempt, and “restore” the pre-fork Ethereum chain as the one and only Ethereum chain.\n\nEthereum One failure scenarios relating to Ethereum Classic resemble the examples in Scenario 4, except that these scenarios would continue to play out until only the Ethereum Classic chain is left — perhaps as a sort of snowball-effect back to the original chain.\n\nAnd there’s an additional category of scenario’s that could spell the end for Ethereum One entirely: scenario’s pertaining to the Ethereum Foundation. Since Ethereum One and the Ethereum Foundation are closely linked, the foundation may be cause for an exodus from Ethereum One to Ethereum Classic, which does not have such a (perceived) single point of failure.\n\nFor one, the Ethereum Foundation might change course itself. If the Ethereum Foundation ever switched focus back to Ethereum Classic, support for Ethereum One might just disappear entirely. This could happen voluntarily, perhaps for one of the reasons described in Scenario 4. Or maybe the Ethereum Foundation will be forced to focus on Ethereum One by court order; it has been suggested that legal cases are already in the making.\n\nOr maybe key members of the Ethereum Foundation quit altogether. Perhaps voluntarily, because they don’t want to develop for the platform any longer. Or perhaps involuntarily, for instance due to mentioned legal trouble. And there are some darker scenario’s as well, scenario’s where “something bad” happens to these key members.\n\n(Though in most of these scenarios, as pointed out in the first part of this series, Ethereum One could still live on as an irrelevant altcoin.)\n\nIn Part 3: How the great Ethereum schism can end badly for both Ethereum Classic and Ethereum One."", ""Ethereum Classic is dominating the cryptocurrency news cycle. After a slumber of some days following the Ethereum hard fork that refunded investors of the hacked DAO, the unforked and re-named Ethereum blockchain and its native token classic ether (ETC) surged. Exchanges enabled trade in the digital currency, investors bought in, miners pointed their hardware to it, and a new development community is forming.\n\nBut Ethereum Classic also has led to chaos and uncertainty. The forked half of the chain — sometimes dubbed “Ethereum One,” and supported by the Ethereum Foundation — is still running as well. Ethereum has, therefore, effectively split into two networks. An unprecedented situation in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe question on everybody's mind is, therefore: How will this end?\n\nIn this three-part series, Bitcoin Magazine provides an overview of some of the scenarios that circulate throughout the different Ethereum communities and the wider blockchain industry.\n\nIn Part 1: How the great Ethereum schism can end relatively well for Ethereum One (but not so much for Ethereum Classic.)\n\nAuthor’s note: Not all scenarios or nuances may be accounted for, nor does inclusion in this list — or the order of it — say anything about likelihood.\n\nScenario 1: Ethereum Classic Fails\n\nThis is the scenario many predicted before and shortly after the hard fork happened. Some within the Ethereum One community are still expecting, and perhaps hoping, for this scenario to play out.\n\nEthereum Classic can fail in several ways, sub-scenarios if you will.\n\nSome consider Ethereum Classic nothing but a scam. The tokens on the “abandoned” side of the chain (abandoned by a majority of hash power, so far) are inherently worthless, they maintain. Anyone who says otherwise must, therefore, be trying to scam people by selling them these “worthless” coins. And like any other scam, it will come to an end sooner or later.\n\nOthers describe Ethereum Classic as a sort of anti-Ethereum movement, driven by trolls or adversaries that would like to see Ethereum or the hard fork fail. If these trolls or adversaries are ignored long enough, they will also have to cease their effort at some point.\n\nYet others claim that development of Ethereum Classic, and development of applications built on top of Ethereum Classic, will grind to a halt as focus re-shifts to Ethereum One: the blockchain and currency with a bigger network effect. This would render Ethereum Classic useless and cause people to leave the chain behind.\n\nOr maybe Ethereum Classic will become more or less obsolete at some point in the future. If Ethereum One somehow implements changes that prevent similar contentious hard forks, it may convince the Ethereum Classic community that the “rollback” really was a one-time only event, and have them decide to re-join Ethereum One.\n\nLastly, the Ethereum Classic network can be 51%-attacked — perhaps by miners supportive of Ethereum One. If this 51%-attack persists long enough, other miners as well as users may give up and abandon the chain for good.\n\nThe counter-argument to all these failure scenarios, is that cryptocurrencies have a way of hardly ever really dying. All it really takes to keep a cryptocurrency going is a single user with a spark of idealism, hope, interest or some other reason to run the software and mine coins.\n\nThat said, it is possible that one or several of the failure scenarios would cause Ethereum Classic to lose its momentum and shine. It could end up as one of the hundreds of completely irrelevant altcoins that almost no one really cares about; a practical failure.\n\nScenario 2: Ethereum Classic Lives On as the Minority Chain\n\nThis scenario was originally expected by the Ethereum Classic initiators.\n\nBefore the hard fork, the Ethereum Classic project leaders hoped to claim, perhaps, 1 percent of the network hash rate and value. Additionally, they expected it would take weeks or months to build a bit of community, infrastructure and everything else a cryptocurrency requires to be viable. In the meantime, the Ethereum Classic project would simply copy any (non-controversial) code from the Ethereum One branch to keep the project moving forward.\n\nAs such, Ethereum Classic would continue to exist as an alternative to fall back on, perhaps in case the forked chain should fail for some unexpected reason. Or maybe because the Ethereum One developers would opt for another contentious hard fork in the future. Detractors could then switch to Ethereum Classic, even with their old ETC balance intact.\n\nWhile not everyone on the Ethereum One side of the community may be happy with Ethereum Classic's existence, it perhaps doesn't need to be all that harmful either. As long as Ethereum One is considered the main chain, most attention and development would, in this scenario, focus on Ethereum One, which could move ahead as planned.\n\nThis scenario can still play out, but with the added benefit for Ethereum Classic that the initial wave of adoption happened much sooner than many expected.\n\nScenario 3: Ethereum Classic Splinters\n\nNow that it appears viable, Ethereum coin-splits may happen more often. And additional branches may split off from Ethereum Classic in particular, as that community fundamentally rejects centralized leadership to guide the project into a single direction.\n\nIndeed, a new schism seems to already be forming within the Ethereum Classic community. Specifically, some users want to follow Ethereum One's every move except for “bailouts” and similar breaches of Ethereum Classic's core principles. Others prefer to adopt more of a distinct technological vision for Ethereum Classic, perhaps, most importantly, rejecting a future switch to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\n\nEthereum One may, in that case, remain the main “Ethereum branch” while three, four, or perhaps even many more minor branches, co-exist. Perhaps with their own “specialty”; one “commercial” branch for everyday-use cases, one more “radically immutable” branch, perhaps a “darker” branch suited for illegal activity, and maybe more. This sort of specialization would not be dissimilar to many other open-source projects.\n\nIn Part 2: How the great Ethereum schism can end relatively well for Ethereum Classic (but not so much for Ethereum One.)"", 'A group of researchers are encouraging universities to set up bitcoin nodes as part of an effort to allow students and professors to experiment and test the network.\n\nThe private testbed network, called BSafe, aims to help the technology proliferate, while possibly preventing instances such as the collapse of Mt Gox or The DAO from happening in the future.\n\n""Most developers in this world think that [bitcoin\'s] fundamental cryptographic algorithm is ideal and can be used as a black box,"" Shin\'ichiro Matsuo, co-founder of BSafe.network, said.\n\nMatuso argues that bitcoin, and for that matter all crypto-financial projects, need a more diverse group of researchers exploring and analyzing the technology.\n\nMatsuo told CoinDesk:\n\n""We need to do more accurate evaluations on blockchain technology.""\n\nThe network will also provide a communication channel between academia and Bitcoin Core developers on the many bitcoin testnets, the alternative blockchains used for testing code before actual live deployment on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDebuted in February, the network currently has five nodes deployed: three in Japan, one in the UK and another recently set up by MIT. Matsuo’s goal is to have 30 university nodes set up before the end of the year, and farther into the future, three university nodes per country.\n\nWhile bitcoin is the first target, Matsuo has ethereum and Hyperledger in his sights for expanding the network\'s work.\n\nMore minds sought\n\nFor Matsuo, the main aim is to bring anthropologists, sociologists, scientists and legal experts into the bitcoin community, which in the minds of many has turned into a pro-bitcoin echo chamber where critical assessments are often times met with scorn.\n\nBut for bitcoin to become a legitimate technology solution to all different types of consumers, neutral, unbiased research needs to be carried out.\n\n""Right now the community is a meritocracy and the majority of it is based on whether you can code,"" said Cory Fields, a Bitcoin Core developer who’s helping BSafe set up a node at MIT.\n\nThis is a typical governance structure within the open-source community and can be a good thing in some ways but detrimental in others.\n\n""Just because I can code doesn’t mean I know anything about economics and the outcomes of economic policies,"" Fields said. ""There’s room for some academics with some weight behind them … to come along and say I can’t code but this policy will be disastrous in the future or worth investigating the outcomes.""\n\nBringing in academics could be a very positive thing. Fields likens it to the development of the Internet, which grew out of a project originally aimed at linking universities together.\n\nAccording to Fields, a consistent set of nodes working in unison would be able to measure things that have been hard to study before. He gave block propagation times – how long it takes to broadcast block authentication to the rest of the nodes – as an example.\n\nFarming talent\n\nPlus, organizers say, universities are a great way to develop talent in a niche field.\n\n""In the space of what is now called blockchain, the expertise is actually quite thin,"" says Pindar Wong, co-founder of BSafe and well-known internet pioneer and bitcoin enthusiast.\n\nHe continued:\n\n""The people who understand the elegant mathematics are unique individuals, probably less than 100 individuals currently take interest in bitcoin at the cryptographic level.""\n\nAnd this, making the space more attractive for people who may have different interpretations of bitcoin\'s pros and cons, is very near and dear to Wong’s heart. Bitcoin as a protocol for innovation lures in entrepreneurs who aren’t always the most safe individuals, he said.\n\nBut safety and soundness in the protocol is very important when dealing with consumer money, and bringing new people into the community also comes with hurdles.\n\n""The thing that frustrates developers is that there are stages of understanding bitcoin and blockchain,"" said Fields.\n\nWhen first learning about bitcoin, outside researchers come up with ideas to rewrite the consensus code to eliminate certain struggles. But these researchers generally don’t realize that those rewrites have been pitched many years ago, worked through and finally shot down.\n\n\'Bigger safety net\'\n\nAnother advantage of setting up testbed networks could be finding vulnerabilities in the code before it leads to problems.\n\nThis process of testing code to guarantee that it does what it\'s supposed to do and nothing else is called code proving. According to Fields, it\'s a particularly important step in deploying code for many industries.\n\nAs it relates to the debates after The DAO attack, there was a camp that thought because users bought into the idea, they should be responsible for reviewing the code. But, not everyone that participated in The DAO had the technical capability to review the code.\n\n""One of the ways around that is to have the code proven which gives a much bigger safety net for end users,"" Fields said.\n\nBut so far, tools for testing and proving these new blockchain protocols haven’t been created yet.\n\n""The DAO and the ethereum hard fork has helped to emphasize the importance of security and correctness of the applications themselves and the protocols on which they depend, moreover the role that academia can play in contributing the productive discussions,"" Wong said.\n\nTestbeds could bring this to the community.\n\nBSafe is not the only testbed project for bitcoin that’s being set up currently, showing a trend towards diversifying the community.\n\n""Like the internet in the 1980s, blockchain tech is not mature; there are many kinds of items there are still debates over in blockchain,"" Matsuo said, concluding:\n\n""And we need many experiments to find a kind of good balance; these sandboxes could help find that balance.""\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies. Interested in offering your expertise or insights to our reporting? Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Kenneth Kappler, CCO of Ethcore and an ex-Ethereum developer, offered an inside view on how the attack on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) took place and gave his views on how future attacks can be prevented, according to Techworld. Kappler spoke at a London Tech Week event aimed at explaining blockchain technology.\n\nProblems with the DAO code were evident to many people before the DAO attack materialized, he said. Many realized the functionality wouldn’t work as advertised and they would have to vote to move funds to a new code. They thought they would have to rewrite the code, redeploy it elsewhere and move the funds.\n\nThe Hacker Strikes\n\nBefore the community had a chance to do this, however, someone found a way to use the bugs in the code to withdraw money from the DAO. This began at around 4 a.m. on a Friday. By 7 a.m., $45 million had been withdrawn, the price of ether fell 40 percent and the price of DAO tokens fell 70 percent.\n\nThe developers were able to find the bug the hacker had exploited. They realized the hacker moved funds into another smart contract with a code that prevented it to be sold on an exchange for 27 days, so the developers knew they had time to address the problem.\n\nImmutability Is A Falsehood\n\nThe hack demonstrated the fact that blockchain-based currencies are not immutable as claimed, Kappler said, since the systems rely on people accepting them. It is possible to create a new blockchain and pass it on to the network and see if the network switches to the new blockchain.\n\nFour years ago, there was a similar situation with bitcoin, he noted.\n\nTo fix the DAO, the core developers decided to roll it back. There was concern, however, that rolling back the DAO could lead to a situation whereby any transaction can be rolled back.\n\nDevelopers Counterattack\n\nThe developers decided to mount a “white hat attack” on the remaining funds in the DAO and the DAO attacker. They spammed the network with dust transactions, allowing them to find the same exploit used to withdraw funds from the original DAO. They were able to drain the hacker’s smart contract.\n\nThe funds are now in separate places, giving the developers a chance to make alterations to the software.\n\nDecisions to make such changes are difficult since public blockchains are social constructs and require acceptance by the community. The money only has value if everybody agrees to it. If this trust is lost because people don’t trust the code or they think they have been robbed, the system fails.\n\nThere have been adjustments made to bitcoin that have not severely affected its operation, Kappler noted.\n\nAlso read: DAO vulnerability raises questions of trust and the human factor\n\nExperiment In Decentralization\n\nThe developers could have designed the DAO to include administrative controls, allowing someone to stop things from happening, but they did not want to have this. DAO was an experiment to determine if a system can exist without central control.\n\nThe solution to the DAO hack will come in the form of a hard fork, which refers to changing the protocol and ensuring the hacked transactions are invalid.\n\nEthcore is an Ethereum client that integrates directly into browsers, according to its website. It was founded by ex-Ethereum developers and offers an enterprise deployment called Parity.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'When digital currency bitcoin took the world by storm a few years ago, blockchain, the technology behind it, was heralded as the future of financial transactions. By removing the middle-man, in bitcoin’s case a bank, blockchain transactions occur peer-to-peer. The open, decentralized network means every transaction is recorded, and must be approved by every other node in the network. That makes transactions more transparent, and more secure. It’s sort of like playing Monopoly, but instead of choosing one person to be the banker, everyone is, and no property can be bought or sold without all players agreeing on the validity and terms of the sale. Plus, all sales are recorded and cannot be amended or deleted.\n\nIn the wake of bitcoin’s rise, the financial implications of blockchain were quickly realized: Users can transfer money securely without having to go through a bank. But blockchain technology has applications far beyond finance, says Shermin Voshmgir, founder of the Blockchain Hub, a network of independent hubs across Europe that promotes the use of blockchain tech to decentralize the internet.\n\nOne startup hoping to realize that potential is Berlin-based Jolocom. Instead of using blockchain to securely store and transfer currency (as with bitcoin), Jolocom wants to use the technology to store and validate digital identities, making data transactions more efficient and secure.\n\n“We are trying to give access to knowledge, knowledge that’s hidden behind walls,” says Jolocom founder Joachim Lohkamp.\n\nJolocom is developing an application that will allow users to share personal information using a secure and decentralized blockchain network. A user’s personal information is tied to them through an individual Web ID generated by the app, allowing them to share information directly with other others in the network. “It’s an extension of hyperlinking,” says Lohkamp. “But instead of linking documents or webpages, you’re linking data.”\n\nSay, for example, you wanted to open a new bank account. Instead of going to the bank in person to fill out paperwork and provide different forms of identification, you could just connect to the bank through the Jolocom app. The bank would then request the necessary information, and, with your approval, the data would be automatically transferred to create your account.\n\nThe same could happen at the doctor’s office: Instead of filling out endless forms every time you see a new doctor, imagine simply transferring the necessary data to them through Jolocom, and receiving information (for example, test results) back through the app as well. Because blockchain records each of these information transactions, and requires that they be verified across the encrypted network, they ultimately form legal blocks of accountability—as secure and accurate as those pesky paper files.\n\nJolocom founder Joachim Lohkamp (Oscar Lopez)\n\nDecentralization also has security benefits. Unlike a Google or Facebook, which store user data on their own centralized servers, Lohkamp wants Jolocom to store user data across a variety of servers in small encrypted packages, accessible only with the correct Web ID. That way, if one server is compromised (say your computer is stolen), it doesn’t matter—each bit of information only makes sense when part of the whole.\n\n“We’re so used to thinking that data has to be centralized,” says Voshmgir. “But that idea is reminiscent of the 60s, when computers were standalone. Blockchain is the first step to decentralizing the internet, to living in a very different world where all the questions about big data and trusted third parties become irrelevant.”\n\nWhile the Jolocom app isn’t yet available—Lohkamp hopes to have a prototype by the end of the year—the startup is already in talks with large companies over its potential use in the health sector. Jolocom has also joined AGILE, a project funded by the European Union’s Research & Innovation program to explore the Internet of Things.\n\n“We’re only just beginning,” says Voshmgir. “It’s not about blockchain. It’s about what you can do with it.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated one of the companies with whom Jolocom is discussing health-sector uses for its app.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

07/31/2016,"['""A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and the real reason,"" as J.P. Morgan succinctly put it a century ago.\n\nThe same applies to finance today, and the attacks against the Ethereum team from a minority of Bitcoin users continue to surprise and amuse me.\n\nI own Bitcoin and support the project. I own Ether and support the project. But what\'s clear is that some influential people in the Bitcoin community are tickled by Ethereum in a way I\'ve not seen before. The price of Bitcoin unexpectedly dropped more than 3 percent over the last 24 hours, and hashrate is declining.\n\nYesterday listening to a series of Ethereum developer presentations in San Francisco - running the gamut from using the blockchain to run an energy ""micro-grid"" that requires no centralized power plant or utility company, to a playful ""Ethereum birthday faucet"" that awarded people a small amount of Ether whenever they sent money to the contract yesterday.\n\nNo one seemed particularly threatened by Ethereum Classic, but it was discussed, and one person told me they weren\'t aware of any well-known developers working on Classic. When I asked if any real money was involved in Classic, the name I heard was Barry Silbert.\n\nSilbert is founder and CEO of the Digital Currency Group and creator of the Bitcoin Investment Trust. The Trust describes itself as ""invested exclusively in bitcoin & derives its value solely from the price of bitcoin.""\n\nLooking for more information on Silbert\'s choice to support Ethereum Classic, I came across the following recent exchange on his Twitter account:\n\nTo little old me, at least, I fail to understand how cynical calculations about how much a pre-fork orphan chain might make for someone over the next six months is ""philosophically"" grounded.\n\nAnd I continue to believe that listing failed orphan chains as ""currencies"" on major crypto exchanges is a very bad idea. Not only because it makes things more difficult and confusing - which perhaps is where the ""philosophical"" love for Ethereum Classic is coming from - but because Classic has a hashrate so low that a group of activist miners could, if they wanted to, 51% attack and destroy Classic. Ethereum Proper, on the other hand, has significant hashrate... making it a smart contract platform less likely to be compromised by activist miners than its weak castaway orphan.\n\nBut I\'ll admit, I have not ""scienced the shit"" out of this as Mr. Silbert has, so maybe I am in the wrong. He has not replied to my requests for an explanation or clarification of why he is suddenly so ""philosophically"" passionate about Ethereum Classic, when the year-old Ethereum smart contracts platform did not interest him.', 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

These indicators line up with the top of the triangle, which add to its strength as a ceiling.\n\nStochastic is heading south but is nearing the oversold region, which suggests that sellers might be feeling exhausted and ready to let buyers take over. In that case, a pullback to the broken triangle support around $650 could be possible before bitcoin price resumes its selloff.\n\nHowever, if buying pressure is strong enough, bulls could push bitcoin price past the triangle resistance at $660 and onto an uptrend. On the other hand, continued selling pressure could lead to a drop to the next long-term support at $600.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe US advanced GDP reading for the second quarter of the year turned out much weaker than expected, as the economy expanded only 1.2%. This was significantly lower than the projected 2.6% growth figure and only a notch higher than the previous period’s 1.1% growth, which means that the US economy didn’t make such a strong rebound.\n\nThis weakened rate hike expectations for September and possibly even for the rest of the year. The dollar weakened across the board in the forex arena but managed to advance against bitcoin price as risk aversion took hold of the market.\n\nWith weaker than expected US GDP growth, global economic performance could continue to slow, leading traders to flock back to the safe-haven dollar versus higher-yielding assets like bitcoin. Note that the triangle pattern is around $100 in height so the resulting selloff could last by the same amount, possibly taking price down to $550.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Further, some have collected data they believe shows this relationship is speculative at best.\n\nThough bitcoin and gold have frequently displayed a notable correlation during times of macroeconomic crisis, this relationship has often broken down once market conditions return to normalcy.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, for example, told CoinDesk:\n\n""There is actually very little correlation when you factor out geopolitical events that drove prices for everything up or down.""\n\nGaining meaningful insight into the relationship between bitcoin and gold requires looking into market correlation, he asserted.\n\n""When overall market correlation is high, so is the correlation for this pair, at least recently,"" he stated. ""When overall correlation is low, so is the correlation between these two.""\n\nPetar Zivkovkski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, went a step further, stating that his firm has yet to detect any ""significant statistical correlation"" between bitcoin and gold.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Any direct or inverse correlation over a set period of time is, in our opinion, purely coincidental.""\n\nAssertions like these could pour cold water over the hopes of many market participants who want the two assets to correlate reliably.\n\nAnalysis of correlation\n\nWhile the price movements of bitcoin and gold are open to interpretation, having greater insight into the relevant market data can help readers develop more well-informed points of view.\n\nAn analysis of historical market data conducted by ARK Invest\'s Chris Burniske failed to illustrate a strong relationship between the two.\n\nBurniske\'s analysis revealed that when examined on a weekly basis, the one-year rolling correlation of bitcoin and gold\'s returns was positive for nearly the entire period between 30th December, 2011, and 20th June, 2014.\n\nHowever, this correlation averaged 0.14 during the period, pointing to a rather weak relationship.\n\nWhile a correlation coefficient of 1 would indicate their returns followed each other perfectly, a correlation of zero would indicate there was no relationship at all. Since the figure of 0.14 is rather close to zero, it points to a very flimsy relationship between the returns of gold and bitcoin.\n\nOn 27th June, 2014, the rolling one-year correlation between bitcoin and gold became negative, staying that way for almost the entire period between then and 24th June, 2016.\n\nThe correlation averaged -0.20 during this time, once again failing to illustrate a strong relationship between the two.\n\nWhen analyzed on a monthly basis – taking data from the first Friday of every month, the correlation was positive for nearly all of the period between 6th January, 2012, and 6th June, 2014.\n\nDuring this time, the correlation between gold and bitcoin was once again weak, averaging 0.13.\n\nOn 4th July, 2014, the relationship between the two became negative, and remained that way for most of the remaining time until 3rd June, 2016.\n\nThe relationship between gold and bitcoin became slightly stronger during the time, averaging -0.21.\n\nAt this level, the correlation between the two still failed to be significant.\n\nMarket size, dynamics\n\nWhen explaining the low correlation between bitcoin and gold, market experts pointed to both the differing market size and market dynamics of the two assets.\n\nZivkovski described the bitcoin market as ""tiny"" in comparison to the gold market, emphasizing that ""the demand needed to drive gold prices"" is much greater than needed to boost bitcoin.\n\nMax Boonen, founder of market maker B2C2, provided a similar statement, telling CoinDesk that the market is ""too small"" to behave like the older, more mature gold market.\n\nMarket expert Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin leverage trading platform BitMEX, also noted the prevalence of ""retail derivatives products like ETFs"" that exist for the gold market as affecting its price movements. Currently, there are two bitcoin-based ETFs that awaiting the approval of regulators.\n\nBlockchain technology firm SolidX announced 12th July that it had filed a registration statement, and government authorities are also considering an ETF proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.\n\nRising bitcoin adoption\n\nWhile the market for gold is far larger – and more mature – than that of bitcoin, the digital currency is enjoying rising adoption.\n\nBitcoin’s transaction aggregate transaction volume has been growing significantly as of late, and people are becoming increasingly open to trying out digital currencies, said Joe Lee, founder of derivatives trading platform Magnr.\n\nAs a rising number of market participants embrace bitcoin, the digital currency\'s price will push higher at times when gold does not, algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk.\n\nFor example, if a major institution adopts bitcoin, this will affect the digital currency\'s price, he noted. However, there is little reason to believe this development will impact gold prices.\n\nPast that, Eliosoff noted that bitcoin is likely to respond to positive technical developments, such as the resolution of longstanding issues regarding how the network handles the size of transaction blocks.\n\n""Over time we should see fewer dramatic bitcoin headlines, with its price moving more and more in line with other fixed-supply commodities,"" he predicted, concluding:\n\n""I\'d bet that\'s many years and a huge price rise away.""\n\nGold weight image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

No wonder that Bitcoin is thriving in Malaysia.\n\n1MDB – Malaysia's Brush with High Level Corruption\n\n1Malaysia Development Bhd, or 1MDB as it is popularly known, is a state investment vehicle set up in 2009 to turn Kuala Lampur into a global financial hub. It started to run into problems in 2015 and has missed repayments on its debt obligations this year.\n\nMore than 10 countries across the world (including US, Switzerland and Singapore) have opened investigations into its affairs.\n\nAfter a furore over corruption allegations, the advisory board of 1MDB headed by Malaysian PM Najib Razak was dissolved in May 2016 and a fresh board appointed.\n\nOrdinary Malaysians Frustrated\n\nThe corruption-tainted transactions of 1MDB, which was set up using public money, has left ordinary Malaysians frustrated. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Chief stepped down 2 years before his term ended, in the midst of the probe into the 1MDB scandal.\n\nCertain liabilities of 1MDB are guaranteed by the Malaysian Government and the failure of 1MDB will increase the budget deficit of Malaysia.\n\nThe Malaysian Ringgit has steadily depreciated since the start of 2015, driven by low commodity prices (primarily oil) and the scandal surrounding 1MDB.\n\nBitcoin Trading Volumes Jump\n\nTrading volumes of Bitcoin in Malaysia have jumped, as shown in the below chart from coin.dance.\n\nThe increased demand for bitcoins in Malaysia is no surprise – countries with weakening economies and loss of faith in the government have always seen people turn to Bitcoin. It is a vote of no-confidence in both the government and the currency.\n\nThis pattern has been repeated in countries ranging from Zimbabwe to Venezuela. Unlike the 1990s, the fortunes of the citizens of a country need not be tied to the fortunes of the country. Bitcoin provides them with an escape route. It is time governments realized that."", 'En Floride (sud-est des Etats-Unis), le Bitcoin n\'est pas considéré comme de l\'argent et peut être échangé sans autorisation spéciale, a décidé la justice, octroyant ainsi une victoire aux défenseurs de la monnaie virtuelle.\n\n""Ce tribunal n\'est pas expert en économie. Cependant il est très clair même pour toute personne ayant des connaissances limitées dans le domaine que le Bitcoin a encore beaucoup de chemin à parcourir pour devenir l\'équivalent des monnaies"", écrit dans une décision, rendue le 22 juillet et consultée par l\'AFP, la juge Teresa Pooler.\n\nPour la magistrate, ""les bitcoins ne sont pas des instruments monétaires"" même s\'ils sont de plus en plus utilisés pour régler des transactions financières.\n\n""Cela veut dire que si vous vendez vos bitcoins à quelqu\'un d\'autre, vous n\'avez pas besoin de licence spécifique. C\'est comme si vous vendiez vos biens"", résume Rene Palomino, avocat de la défense dans cette affaire, la première du genre aux Etats-Unis\n\nEn revanche, ""si vous vendez les bitcoins pour le compte d\'une tierce personne, il vous faut une licence car vous êtes un intermédiaire type Western Union"", ajoute le conseil.\n\nMichel Espinoza, un habitant de Miami, était jugé pour avoir vendu en 2013 et 2014, à un policier en civil, des bitcoins pour une valeur totale de 1.500 dollars sur LocalBitcoins, une plateforme dédiée. Ce dernier lui avait dit qu\'il comptait utiliser la devise virtuelle pour voler des numéros de cartes bancaires.\n\nPoursuivi pour blanchiment d\'argent, son avocat faisait valoir que le Bitcoin n\'était pas considéré comme une monnaie à part entière dans l\'Etat de Floride.\n\n- tache d\'huile -\n\nEn lui donnant raison, la juge Pooler a ajouté une corde à l\'arc des promoteurs de cette crypto-monnaie, censée accompagner la transformation numérique de la finance et mettre fin au contrôle par les pouvoirs publics et les banques du circuit des transactions financières.\n\n""Les défenseurs du Bitcoin l\'ont toujours présenté comme un système s\'autorégulant et devant garder un statut à part, une alternative fiable aux monnaies contrôlées par les gouvernements. Ce jugement les conforte"", estime Arthur Long, avocat spécialisé au cabinet new-yorkais Gibson, Dunn.\n\nCraig Wright le 20 avril 2016 à New York City GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP/Jemal Countess\n\nCette victoire tombe en plein débat sur l\'identité de l\'inventeur de la monnaie numérique après que l\'Australien Craig Wright se fut présenté en mai comme son père putatif avant de faire quelque peu machine arrière.\n\nCréé en 2009 par un ou plusieurs mystérieux informaticien(s) cachés derrière le pseudonyme Satoshi Nakamato, le Bitcoin est une crypto-monnaie, utilisée essentiellement au départ par les ""geeks"" et l\'économie souterraine qui a prospéré dans les pays connaissant de fortes inflations comme l\'Argentine et le Venezuela.\n\nMalgré sa forte volatilité, elle a connu son âge d\'or lors de la crise grecque car elle est devenue, pour un grand nombre de Grecs, un outil de réserve pour placer leur épargne face aux craintes de retour de la drachme.\n\nSon avantage, selon ses promoteurs, est qu\'elle est une monnaie virtuelle mondiale et ne dépend donc ni d\'un Etat ni d\'une banque centrale.\n\nDans certains Etats américains, elle est acceptée dans des restaurants et de nombreux magasins alors qu\'elle reste interdite en France et en Chine par exemple.\n\nSi le verdict de la juge Pooler s\'applique principalement à la Floride, il pourrait faire tache d\'huile dans le reste du pays.\n\n""ça va aiguiller d\'autres Etats et d\'autres tribunaux appelés à se prononcer sur cette question"", estime Charles Evans, professeur de finance à l\'Université Barry. Cet expert, dont les études affirment que le Bitcoin n\'est pas une monnaie à part entière, a été cité par la défense de M. Spinoza.\n\nLes autorités américaines sont partagées sur le Bitcoin: Pour le fisc (IRS), c\'est un bien personnel, alors que le département du Trésor l\'assimile à une monnaie pouvant être utilisée par des malfrats et autres cartels de la drogue pour blanchir de l\'argent sale.\n\nLe régulateur financier de l\'Etat de New York (NYDFS) exige pour sa part une licence - Bitlicence - pour effectuer des transactions.\n\nQuelque 15 millions de bitcoins ont été créés dont environ 14 millions seulement sont en circulation, selon les experts.', ""In the wake of the split into ETH and ETC - Ethereum Classic, following the recent hack of The DAO on the Ethereum platform which led to a hard fork to recover the stolen funds, Max Kordek, Lisk CEO, has come out to “clean up some misunderstandings, and explain briefly what Lisk is and what it isn’t.”\n\nLisk is not a fork of Ethereum\n\nIn a blog post to the Lisk community, Kordek states categorically that Lisk is not a fork of Ethereum as the first of various misunderstandings, myths, and other wrong facts he wanted to dispel.\n\nKordek writes:\n\n“The Lisk code base was forked from the Crypti project Oliver and I were a part of for 18 months before we started Lisk. About 2 years ago Crypti collected 750 BTC in order to develop a Blockchain application platform. In the end the Crypti foundation developed a code base which was a good starting point for a new project.”\n\nOn growth potential in China\n\nKordek, who recently visited China, also noted that Lisk is not a competitor to every Blockchain project, though practically everything could be implemented into a Lisk sidechain and the Blockchain space is big enough to have several projects solving the same issues.\n\nHe says the Lisk App SDK is a framework to deploy users’ own sidechains and develop Blockchain applications on top of them. These include platform independent social networks, messengers, games, financial applications, prediction markets, exchanges, storage platforms, contract execution platforms etc, without the hassle of complicated consensus protocols or P2P networking algorithms. Everything is written in JavaScript.\n\nOn his recent trip to China where he listened to Vitalik Buterin's first presentation in Chinese, and also talked to him briefly as well as to the Lisk community, he says to CoinTelegraph that the Asian giant is another game with an enormous potential for his project.\n\n“I encountered a different culture, met many Blockchain enthusiasts, and I personally see a huge potential for Lisk in China. This was definitely not my last trip to China, and we will make major efforts in China and Asia as a whole with Lisk. We will be back in China in late September. However, partnerships don't happen overnight. I met many individuals who are interested in what we at Lisk are working on. Obviously, Lisk needs to grow first on the technology side to make a huge splash. The next time I'm in China we will continue all these discussions. Lisk will be ready then in terms of technology and business. If you connect Lisk and China the only possible step is forward.”\n\nIs Lisk ready?\n\nIn the post, he stated that Lisk isn’t ready or else there wouldn’t have been an ICO. Some parts of our great vision still take months, other parts maybe years. It doesn’t take a week to revolutionize the app market, he noted.\n\nHowever, in the email, he said that within the next two weeks, he will be moving to Berlin with Oliver to open up an office and “the legal entity will also be established sooner rather than later, we will get access to the funds, and the real business can then begin.”\n\nKordek concludes:"", 'By the look of things, the cashless society might not be as far off as most people would think. More and more stores are going cashless on their own accord and flock towards card payments and mobile checkouts. Then again, not everyone will notice when a company stops accepting cash either, as most people hardly use that form of payment in certain locations.\n\nIn reality, cash is accepted at fewer place than most people anticipate right now. Buying an airline ticket, or a car, for example, can’t be done in cash anymore. It only makes sense for some retail locations not to deal with the hassle of cash either, even though there will always be store owners who swear by this method of payment.\n\nCashless Is Not The Answer You Are Looking For\n\nTo put this into perspective, a place selling food or sandwiches may be inclined to stop accepting cash. Since the amounts are pretty small compared to other solutions, not having to deal with change, coins, and bills may make more sense. US customers are always more inclined to use their cards for payments wherever they are in the world anyway.\n\nThat being said, there are inherent risks when dealing with card or mobile payments. In fact, the majority of mobile solutions builds on top of insecure card payments, to begin with. Consumers really need to ask themselves if they want to trust yet another third party with their sensitive payment details.\n\nBut there are other concerns to take into account as well. When using mobile and card payments, tallying up totals at the end of the day must be done in a different way. Moreover, these methods could also cause more theft and items not being paid for correctly in the long run. If that were to be the case, the issues would only become apparent at the end of the day.\n\nMore importantly, no longer being able to use cash means anonymity is being removed for customers. While not everyone may value that aspect, consumers will leave a digital trail of their payments and locations. Third-party service providers will aggregate that data and use it for whatever purpose they see fit.\n\nFor consumers, the biggest concern is how they will give the banks even more power when going cashless. Mobile and card payment usage depends on the banks entirely, who will gain an even tighter control over funds belonging to their customers. That is not an ideal situation for the consumer, even though very few people realize the repercussions of their financial actions these days.\n\nSource: NY Times\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Media platforms can offer a better experience to its users by getting rid of ads and compensating for the revenues by introducing a bitcoin paywall. Read more...\n\nOnline advertisements have become a nuisance that internet users are fed up with. As the users try to make peace with online advertisements, the ads continue to become more obtrusive, forcing people to find alternate measures like ad blockers.\n\nOne of the topics discussed at the recently concluded Blockchain+Digital Currencies conference was related to the role of digital currencies in improving the online media experience. Advertisements are an integral part of various online media websites. These platforms generally offer content to its consumers for free, while generating revenue through advertisements. Without advertisements, most of these platforms will be unable to sustain their operations. At the same time, these very ads kill the user experience.\n\nIn addition to causing interference, these online ads distributed through ad networks also employ trackers and cookies which keep track of user activities while meddling with the page load times. Media platforms can improve their user experience by eliminating advertisements if they can find an alternate way to generate revenue. Bitcoin and other digital currencies may be able to offer these online media sites with that alternative revenue channel.\n\nWhile speaking at the conference, Victoria Van Eyk – the co-founder of Bitcoin Strategy Group spoke about the use of bitcoin for content monetization, thereby providing an alternative revenue stream for online media platforms. The content monetization process involves creating a paywall, which requires the visitor to make a small transaction to be able to access the content.\n\nPaywalls have been looked down upon by people. The scientific community has long been engaged in a debate with journals and publications regarding paid access to research papers and scientific literature. However, the digital currency makes the idea of paywall more acceptable as long as it is not ridiculously high.\n\nDigital currencies like bitcoin make it more feasible for people to make micro and nanotransactions which are otherwise impossible with the conventional payment system. For example, the cost of transaction for making a microtransaction with fiat currency may exceed the transaction amount itself.\n\nBy setting up a paywall that requires users to pay a small amount in digital currency to access content, media platforms can ensure that they have revenues flowing in. At the same time, they can keep their website free from advertisements.\n\nThe reduction of online ads will also reduce the risk of malware and other security vulnerabilities.\n\nRef: The Observers | Image: Waypress', 'Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology has already expanded from just being a ledger, keeping a record of all transactions happening over the network to a widely adopted technology across industries. Smart contracts based on blockchain technology can be used to automate various process across industries.\n\nThe major application of blockchain technology currently lies in the banking and financial sectors, involving a lot of time-consuming repetitive processes. By creating smart contracts that are programmed to automatically execute certain processes when the predetermined conditions are met, lot of resources in terms of time and manpower can be saved. Automation can save these institutions a lot of money. However, there are concerns about the effect of increased automation. Some fear that the use of smart contracts in the banking and financial sector may lead to a reduction in jobs.\n\nSmart Contracts and Industrial Robots\n\nThe effects of increased automation in the banking and financial sector can be compared to the similar scenario in the manufacturing sector. Surveys conducted to study the effect of increased automation in industries on job positions and opportunities have reported no significant changes until now. However, a study on the impact of industrial robots on employment during the period of 1993 to 2007 in 17 countries has indicated a slight increase in overall wages due to increased automation.\n\nAccording to a report, the use of software robots to interact with a firm’s back office system can cost the company as less as $2.70 per hour. But unlike humans who are assigned to do the same job, these software robots can operate round the clock and process huge amounts of data. The productivity gains from using an automated system to maintain a company’s financial system can achieve productivity gains by over 90 percent with 100 percent accuracy, says another report by Tata Consultancy Services. The same report also states that robotic process automation in insurance sector to validate claims can lead to almost 80 percent reduction in transaction times.\n\nAutomation of any form, whether it is robotic process automation using software programs or self-executing smart contracts for trade settlement and other financial operations, can’t replace customer facing operations, states a recent article in one of the financial magazines. Also, increased automation in various sectors has led to an increase in jobs that require monitoring and maintenance of such systems.\n\nBy drawing parallels between automation using industrial robots, software programs, and smart contracts, we can conclude that the impact of blockchain technology on employment may not be significant. However, there will be a significant change in job profiles of the future. A present day employee in the financial sector who expects to remain employed when this shift happens, should keep up with the changes in the technology and upgrade his/her skills.']"
