02/01/2016,"['Shaun Bridges, a former Secret Service agent who was part of the investigation into the now-defunct dark website Silk Road – but who was subsequently prosecuted for stealing $800,000 in the online crypto-currency bitcoin from the site – has been arrested at his home in Laurel, Maryland, the day before he was scheduled to hand himself in to begin his prison sentence.\n\nAn arrest warrant was issued under seal on Wednesday and executed on Thursday. During the arrest, according to court documents, officers found bags containing Bridges’s passport and a notarised copy of his passport, as well as corporate records for three offshore entities in Nevis, Belize and Mauritius.\n\nHe also had several Secret Service-issued bulletproof vests which the state contends had been stolen from the government.\n\nIs Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road’s pirate king, a mobster or a martyr? Read more\n\nThe web of corruption surrounding the Silk Road investigation was nothing short of breathtaking. Along with an undercover agent with the Drug Enforcement Agency, Carl Force, Bridges was involved in the investigation into “Dread Pirate Roberts”, the mysterious figure behind Silk Road. Force was in communication with the Roberts account under the alias “Nob”.\n\n“Dread Pirate Roberts” turned out to be Ross Ulbricht, who was arrested in 2013 and charged with conspiracy to traffic drugs. A separate charge for the attempted purchase of a murder-for-hire is pending. In 2015, he was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nBut the Force and Bridges affair was to prove a humiliating coda for the government, leading attorneys for Ulbricht to say that corruption “pervaded the investigation of Silk Road”.\n\nForce, using the other aliases “French Maid” and “Death From Above”, used the knowledge gleaned during the investigation to extort hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin from Ulbricht. The pair also siphoned bitcoin given to them by the government for use in the investigation into personal accounts, even setting up bitcoin investment funds, called Quantum Investments and Engedi LLC, in their own name.\n\nUlbricht believed the bitcoin had been stolen by a Silk Road employee, Curtis Green, who was in fact a state’s witness. He used “Nob” – who was really Force – to procure the murder-for-hire for which he was eventually convicted, and Force, Green, and Bridges faked Green’s death.\n\nForce is currently serving a 6.5-year sentence, and Bridges is in custody and considered a flight risk, according to the government’s motion detailing his arrest, though the Department of Justice did not respond to several requests by the Guardian for more information.', 'Dan Elitzer is a member of IDEO Futures, where he leads IDEO\'s Bits + Blocks coLAB, an innovation lab exploring blockchains and related technology in collaboration with Citi Ventures, Fidelity Labs and Nasdaq.\n\nThis article was written by Elitzer in conjunction with his colleagues at IDEO Futures – Joe Gerber, Reid Williams, Diego Rodriguez, Piper Loyd, Ted Ko and Eric Chan.\n\nIn the opinion piece, the team looks at recent challenges facing bitcoin, and express their belief that bitcoin and blockchain hold as much promise as they did a year ago.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin good for, if not an occasional dose of drama?\n\nReaders of the recent New York Times piece, ""The Bitcoin Believer Who Gave Up"", have been rightfully concerned about the future of bitcoin. But there remains much more promise for bitcoin and blockchain than readers might glean from this single snapshot.\n\nYes, there are significant technical and governance challenges for scaling bitcoin. The number of transactions the network can process today is far too low and the security and software development concentrated in too few hands.\n\nNone of the concerns raised by developer Mike Hearn in his farewell message (to bitcoin specifically; he is now working full-time for the blockchain consortium R3CEV) are news to those who have been following bitcoin closely.\n\nHowever, these challenges should be seen as symptoms of bitcoin’s amazing success to date rather than its imminent demise. In barely seven years of existence, bitcoin has moved from a fringe technology for libertarians and drug dealers to a commodity valued at over $5bn (with a \'B\'), the basis of over $1bn in venture capital investment.\n\nBitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology are the focus of R&D efforts by nearly every major financial services company, the MIT Media Lab, and the UK government.\n\nJust last week, Digital Asset Holdings announced a $52m fundraise from some of the biggest players on Wall Street, as well as revealing the selection of their blockchain-based software as the new infrastructure for the Australian Securities Exchange.\n\nAll the problems Hearn cites have arisen because more and more people and institutions want to use bitcoin; they are more like growing pains than a death knell.\n\nGrowing ecosystem\n\nDespite the current challenges, we still believe bitcoin and blockchain hold as much promise as they did a year ago when we decided to start the Bits + Blocks coLAB.\n\nOnce you’ve seen the power of a peer-to-peer digital currency and permissionless payment network, it’s hard to unsee them. Bitcoin has opened our eyes and created new expectations for the ways we store and transfer value of all kinds.\n\nWhile we believe in bitcoin specifically, we also see it as just one piece of a growing ecosystem of distributed systems, shared ledgers, and cryptographic technology which will have a profound impact on how we interact, transact, and communicate with each other.\n\nBitcoin may eventually fail to live up to the potential we see for it, but it is certainly ripe with learning and worthy of our attention. We are still inspired by the vast potential of blockchain technology to foster new forms of trust and exchange.\n\nOur most recent research into how these technologies might enable new digital identity systems left us feeling more confident than ever that blockchains are powerful tools that will lead to the creation of great new experiences.\n\nBitcoin has been declared dead many times before, something that should come as no surprise, given it is a very early-stage technology that has already taken a couple steep rides up and down the hype cycle.\n\nMuch like the evolution of the internet starting with TCP/IP protocols that have resulted in the web we use today, the revolutionary changes made possible by bitcoin and blockchain will likely take at least five to 10 years to begin to reach their potential.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The blockchain project is facilitated by the bank’s collaboration with blockchain-startup Digital Asset Holdings (DAH).\n\nThe largest bank in the United States by assets – JPMorgan Chase has begun a trial project that utilizes blockchain technology, in collaboration with New York-based blockchain startup Digital Asset.\n\nThe two companies are looking to introduce distributed ledger or blockchain technology to the current financial industry. One of the immediate uses of the trial project is to address liquidity mismatches in JPMorgan’s loan funds, as revealed by the Financial Times on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking to the publication, Daniel Pinto, head of JPMorgan’s investment bank noted that loans were a good sector for blockchain technology to be trialed. He sees the current loan system as one where “the settlement process is complex with lots of manual intervention and multiple parties.”\n\nTo sell a loan is a very cumbersome, time –consuming process; settlement can take weeks.\n\nJPMorgan – Firmly on the Blockchain Boat\n\nJPMorgan is the lead investor in Digital Asset’s recent closure of a recent funding round that exceeded $50 million from 13 firms. Banks, stock exchanges, clearing houses and other players in the banking ecosystem were among the 13 investors.\n\nThe financial institution was picked out as one of two banks –along with Goldman Sachs—to gain from blockchain technology replacing traditional banking methods in a recent industry survey that polled some 150 executives and investors in the banking sector.\n\nSuffice to say, the biggest US bank by assets is investing heavily in distributed ledger technology. A recently leaked internal JPMorgan memo revealed that the bank has plans to invest some $9 billion in technologies such as the blockchain and robotics.\n\nJPMorgan is also involved in the Open Ledger Project, an open-source distributed ledger project headed by the Linux Foundation. The project is expected to bring uniformity in distributed ledger standards that could potentially be adopted by the banking and financial industry as a whole.\n\nSpeaking to FT, Pinto was clear about his take and the bank’s approach to exploring blockchain technology.\n\nBlockchain will be big in everything related to settlement, and not just loans. While it is still early days, the technology looks very good.\n\nBitcoin’s underlying technology, the blockchain, has had a mammoth year in 2015 with investments and interest from banks, governments and private enterprise around the world. 2016 is shaping up to be the year when blockchain technology powers real-world platforms and provides tangible solutions. In January 2016, a private blockchain experiment spanning 11 banks across four continents was revealed by blockchain startup R3, which also sees JPMorgan as one of its participating member banks.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The concept of digital currency was well-known way before Bitcoin and consorts staked their claim. One of the most notorious digital currencies in history is Liberty Reserve, which ultimately failed because it was still centralized. Furthermore, the founder of Liberty Reserve pleaded guilty to money laundering recently, a concept that is not possible with Bitcoin by any means.\n\nLiberty Reserve Founder Dug His Own Grave\n\nOne of the main reasons why Liberty Reserve became so popular and well-known throughout the years is because this digital currency was used for criminal activities all over the world. Laundering money online was never easier than by using Liberty Reserve, as this particular digital currency was completely anonymous from day one.\n\nIt should come as no secret to find out the founder of this once popular digital currency was guilty of criminal activities himself. Based on a report by the United States Department of Justice, Arthur Budovsky pleaded guilty to laundering money worth more than US$250 million through the Liberty Reserve protocol.\n\nU.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York stated:\n\n“Arthur Budovsky founded and operated Liberty Reserve, an underworld cyber-banking system that laundered hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds for criminals around the world. The only liberty that Budovsky and Liberty Reserve promoted was the freedom to commit and profit from crime. Thanks to this truly global investigation that included cooperation from 17 countries, Liberty Reserve has been shut down, and its founder Arthur Budovsky stands convicted in an American court of law, facing the loss of his own liberty.”\n\nPeople who have ever read about Liberty Reserve in its prime may remember high the digital currency was touted as the largest money transfer system of the world. With its anonymous appeal and untraceable transactions, the digital currency gained a lot of attention from people looking to perform less than legitimate tasks over the Internet.\n\nIt would only be a matter of time until US government officials decided to take a closer look at the Liberty Reserve scheme. To prevent that from happening, Budovsky moved to Costa Rica, which has no extradition policy with the US. Furthermore, Budovsky renounced his US citizenship in 2011, cutting all ties with his nation of birth.\n\nLiberty Reserve was a preferred method of payment in the credit card fraud industry. Hackers who obtained databases full of credit card records would accept Liberty Reserve payments in exchange for consumer information. As the system was completely anonymous, there was no way to link these individuals to those activities.\n\nAt its peak, the formerly popular digital currency had over 5 million accounts around the world, and millions of transactions had been processed at that time. Plenty of funds was laundered by the founder and a small group of other co-defendants. The US government eventually managed to shut down the platform in 2013.\n\nBitcoin is Completely Transparent, And Companies Are AML Compliant\n\nUnlike Liberty Reserve in the past, Bitcoin is a completely new breed of digital currency. Even though mainstream media will keep telling people how Bitcoin is completely anonymous, the blockchain is a public ledger where anyone can track any transaction in real-time. But that is not the only aspect that makes Bitcoin so appealing to people from all over the world.\n\nMoney laundering through Bitcoin is simply not possible, as all companies in this space are working hard to be fully compliant with AML and KYC regulations. Doing so removes the last layer of illusionary anonymity people might associate with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is one of the last favorable tools among internet criminals these days, simply because it is far too transparent.\n\nSource: Justice.Gov', 'The long-lasting block size dispute has catapulted into the center of attention again. One of the most talked-about developments is Segregated Witness, of which a public testnet iteration was launched last week. The innovation as recently proposed by Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille is a centerpiece of a scalability “roadmap” set out by Bitcoin Core.\n\nTo find out where the broader development community stands on Segregated Witness, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to library and wallet developers, those who will need to do the heavy lifting in order to utilize the innovation once rolled out.\n\nIn part 6 of this series: Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin.\n\nSegregated Witness Highly Supportable\n\nElectrum – a hybrid model of light clients for end users and full node servers run by hosts – is one of the most-used wallets in the Bitcoin ecosystem today; according to Voegtlin’s estimations, his software processes up to 10 percent of all Bitcoin transactions. The developer has started experimenting with the Segregated Witness testnet, and will try to integrate it into his wallet once rolled out on the Bitcoin network.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Voegtlin said:\n\n“I like Segregated Witness because it makes Bitcoin cleaner, by separating transaction data from script data. That separation has the benefit of finally removing transaction malleability, which is much needed. It also opens the door for future extensions of the scripting language, enabling all sorts of new use cases. And of course, I’m favorable to an increase in the network capacity.”\n\nThe developer believes that the added effort to integrated Segregated Witness is within acceptable range.\n\n“It will be very easy to support transacting to Segregated Witness addresses,” Voegtlin explained. “But to really support Segregated Witness, we need to change address generation in the wallet, and the way transactions are signed. The first step will be to update the Electrum servers, in order to index Segregated Witness scripts – then to update the client. I can combine the server work with a more general update which I planned to do anyway. All in all, that will probably keep me busy for a few months – but the added effort for Segregated Witness is manageable.”\n\nSoft Fork Best Overall\n\nThe Bitcoin Core development team plans to roll out Segregated Witness as a soft fork in April of this year. Once a super-majority of miners agrees on this solution, wallets can utilize the benefits – including almost 1 megabyte of added block space for transactions.\n\nBut this strategy is now being contested by recently launched Bitcoin Core competitor Bitcoin Classic. Bitcoin Classic plans to deploy a 2-megabyte block size increase through a hard fork instead, meaning all full nodes on the network need to switch.\n\nVoegtlin explained that he has no strong position on the preferred block size limit itself – though he regrets that technical discussion has taken a backseat lately.\n\n“I am not in a position to tell what the best block size is,” Voegtlin said. “Unfortunately, the block size debate has been dominated by quasi-religious attitudes, conflicts of interest, struggles of power and very little scientific data. I wish it was merely a technical issue. However, when a group of people proposes to hard fork Bitcoin against the will of its core developers, it stops being a technical issue, it becomes political.”\n\nAs such, Voegtlin believes that a soft fork would be the best way to go, for now.\n\n“If we lived in a perfect world, where all developers agree on the direction Bitcoin should take, then a hard fork would be better, because it would be cleaner,” he said. “However, after all the controversy we had, and the various attempts to impose a hard fork against the will of Bitcoin Core developers, I believe a soft fork is preferable. Not for technical reasons, but for political reasons.”\n\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine’s three-part series on the subject, or part 1, part 2, part 3 and part 4 of this development series.', ""AU, February 1, 2016 at 08:24 UTC\n\nA small development team from Australia are poised to bring a potential trillion dollar industry to bitcoin.\n\nA team of three 20-something developers (Jesse Gileppa, Dao Zhou and Julie Lovisa), lead by Noel Lovisa, have created an entirely new software development technology, a technology that utilises a peer-to-peer network of software experts called vendors who transact exclusively using bitcoin.\n\n“It is really quite simple,” says Noel Lovisa, the founder of Code Valley.\n\n“Would you rather your software be written by a handful of generalists, or built by thousands of specialists, each an expert at their own particular part of the design?” Noel says.\n\nThis statement goes to the very heart of the technology. Instead of a team of software developers writing millions of lines of code (today's method for producing software), a developer now 'tells' the supply-chain what the software should do, and some short time later, a software program exactly satisfying those requirements is returned. Little does the developer know, the delivered program was actually collectively designed by hundreds of thousands of co-operating vendors, who contract out their expertise for bitcoin.\n\nShifting software development from an industry of craftsmen to one that revolves around a global supply-chain sounds suspiciously like the industrialisation of software, a term which Code Valley has rather boldly embraced.\n\n“The 'word' industrialisation seems to carry with it unnecessary negative connotations.” says Noel. “This technology does not mean the replacement of craftsmen with assembly lines. The supply-chain is not replacing software developers, the supply-chain is software developers. Every single vendor in that chain is built, owned and managed by a software developer,” he adds.\n\nThe 'industrialisation of software' could put an end to many of the notorious issues that the industry currently faces.\n\n“As hard as it might be to admit, the software industry may never really have exited the crisis of the late 60s. In other established industries, schedule overruns are very rare – occurring about 4% of the time. In software, schedule overruns occur 33% of the time. It seems software has never really had a chance to arrive as an industry,” says Julie Lovisa, who (ironically) switched from a successful research career in Civil Engineering to join the team at Code Valley in 2014.\n\nNow that a single program is the work of hundreds of thousands of contracted vendors, and each transaction deals exclusively with bitcoin, what does this mean for a Bitcoin network approaching blocksize capacity? Surprisingly, the process of software development using Code Valley technology is a recursive one, which means that a vendor inherits the reputation of its suppliers, and will therefore choose these suppliers wisely. This promotes the cultivation of trusted, long-term relationships between vendors, the perfect conditions for micro-payment channels.\n\n“We aren't putting hundreds of thousands of contracts onto the blockchain – that would be disastrous. When you combine the sheer number of transactions the supply-chain must cater for, the logical solution is micro-payment channels.” says Noel.\n\nAlthough Code Valley have not yet made a supply-chain available to the public, it appears their development schedule is significantly advanced – the Code Valley website was apparently built using Code Valley technology, which required over 500,000 contracts to the supply-chain and took just minutes to build.\n\nhttp://codevalley.com\n\nThe publication of a press release on this page should not be viewed as an endorsement by CoinDesk.

The working title of the project so far is “The Bitverse.” The goal, as Barisser stated, is to:\n\n“Construct(ing) a decentralized website in such a way that it cannot be censored or suppressed. Moreover, the website’s space, its actual pixels, are themselves for sale via a protocol abstracted on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain.”\n\nBarisser’s idea, not dissimilar from Kim Dotcom’s idea for an alternative internet would allow users to own a pixel within a page, allowing a censor-free environment assuming that the rest of the blockchain associated with “The Bitverse” did not allow it. The only messages allowed would be by those owned legitimately by people with Bitcoin addresses associated with those pixels within a page. Any messages wouldn’t be acknowledged. In total, the designed scarcity of the space will be about 1920X1080 pixels.\n\nThe space within “The Bitverse” can not only be owned, but traded, bought and sold with transactions. With much of the same logic referred to in the Bitcoin whitepaper published by Satoshi Nakamoto, the attackers, regulators, authorities or spammers of this “Bitverse” would need to outpace the blockchain effect of the network, which would prove prohibitively difficult.\n\nAn owner of pixels on the Bitiverse cannot be silenced unless a majority of the Bitcoin mining pool decided to; an unlikely occurrence. If the content_url is shut down by outside powers, a new one may be created and re-broadcast immediately, becoming a confirmed Bitcoin transaction within minutes. The authorities would have to have the capability of shutting down arbitrary IP addresses every 10 minutes to stifle this.\n\nOwners of pixels will have their ownership justified by their possession of a cryptographic key rather than the registration and recognition of anyone else, particularly a third party.\n\nWhile this concept proposed by Barisser is a very abstract one, it’s easier to imagine the concept of being able to own, rent or transfer a piece of this alternative internet real estate as easy as one can do the same with Bitcoins. Barisser stated a larger-scale application he’d like to see applied with this technology is a Reddit which doesn’t rely on centralization or trust.\n\nThere is currently no example of this “Bitverse” to look at, however, Barisser stated in his blog post that he intends to release alpha version source code very soon that functions on a basic level.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
02/02/2016,"['BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will propose by the end of June stricter rules on prepaid cards and virtual currencies in a bid to reduce anonymous payments and curb the financing of terrorism, documents released on Tuesday showed.\n\nResponding to attacks in Paris last November by Islamic State militants, the Commission is also considering imposing controls on bank transfers within the EU that are currently not monitored through the controversial EU-US Terrorist Financing Tracking Programme (TFTP).\n\n“We must cut off terrorists’ access to funds and enable authorities to better track financial flows to prevent devastating attacks such as those in Paris,” EU Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.\n\nBrussels intends to curb terrorists’ use of all means of payments, including cash and banking transactions, but will initially focus its regulatory work on prepaid cards and virtual currencies, of which Bitcoin is by far the most used with more than 80 percent of the market capitalization.\n\n“There seems to be a risk that virtual currencies may be used by terrorist organizations to conceal financial transactions, as these can be carried out more anonymously,” a Commission document said.\n\nPrepaid cards raise the same sort of concerns as their users are not always identified. The French authorities have also proved their use by the Paris attackers.\n\nPrepaid cards are issued by a wide range of operators including banks using major networks, such as Visa and Mastercard. They are different from debit and credit cards because they need to be loaded before payments can be made, but can carry substantial amounts of money.\n\nFor both Bitcoin and prepaid cards, the Commission will propose new rules by the end of June forcing the identification of their users.\n\nUsers of virtual currencies may have to provide personal data when exchanging Bitcoin for real currencies. Consumers may be obliged to provide their identity when buying prepaid cards, a move that is currently not always required across the EU.\n\nThe Commission plan falls short of what was requested by France, which asked for caps on amounts that can be loaded onto prepaid cards and limits on the conversion of virtual currencies into real currencies.\n\nMORE CHECKS ON BANK TRANSFERS?\n\nThe EU executive’s plan foresees a range of other measures to be implemented by the end of 2017, including possible common rules to freeze terrorist assets across the EU and stricter checks on financial transfers involving some non-EU countries.\n\nBrussels will also assess whether it is feasible to set up a European programme to track terrorist funds, along the lines of the TFTP, which has long been opposed by EU lawmakers and privacy campaigners because it allows widespread checks on consumers’ bank transfers.\n\nA decision on whether to move forward with an EU TFTP will be made by the end of 2016.', 'Australian Bitcoin mining firm Bitcoin Group Ltd.’s initial public offering (IPO) hasn’t been the success the company had hoped with a bookbuild for the float managing to raise only 30 percent of the funds they were seeking.\n\nBitcoin Group were looking to raise AU$20 million ($14 million) in an IPO offering of 100 million new shares at AU$0.20 (14 cents) a share however only managed to raise $AU5.9 million ($4.2 million).\n\nThe company is naturally spinning the result, with Chief Executive Officer Sam Lee describing it as “solid” and telling CNBC that “it is sufficient for the company to execute its current strategy of expanding our footprint through acquiring new mining equipment.”\n\nTroubled path\n\nFounded in 2014, Bitcoin Group claims to have a vision of making “trust more accessible via Bitcoin’s underlying Blockchain technology,” and to their credit, and unlike many in the Bitcoin mining space, they claim to be cash flow positive and profitable as well.\n\nThat said it has been a troubled path to an IPO for the company who first floated the idea of going public in 2014.\n\nIn a combination of perhaps poor management, and the fact that listing a Bitcoin mining concern on the Australian Stock Exchange is within itself something completely new, the company received stop orders on three initial attempts to list from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), in particular relating to claims made in their prospectus.\n\n“As the world’s first IPO in our industry, we are no doubt setting a precedent…ASIC’s role to protect Australian investors means they need to understand our unique business model,” Lee told local media in September. “We appreciate the patience ASIC have taken to understand what we do, and thank their co-operation in helping ensure our prospectus accurately reflects the current and future opportunity of Bitcoin Group.”\n\nWhile on one hand the IPO process could be interpreted as an abysmal failure given how little was raised versus how much the company was trying to raise, credit where due though as it was never going to be an easy undertaking to begin with, particularly given Australia’s conservative investment community, dominated by superannuation (retirement) funds.\n\nThat picture may change in coming years however as Australian companies, particularly its financial institutions, pay more attention to Bitcoin and the related Blockchain sector, and is perhaps best represented the fact that the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) itself is currently exploring using the Blockchain to settle trades on its market.\n\nNo date has yet been given as to when Bitcoin Group will list on the ASX.\n\nImage credit: Bitcoin Group.', 'Bitcoin exchange Kraken announced a multi-million dollar agreement with SBI Investment, one of Japan’s leading and most respected venture capital firms, to invest in and lead the Series B round of financing in Kraken.\n\nSBI Investment is the venture capital arm of SBI Holdings, the world’s first Internet-based financial conglomerate.

Before this investment round, Kraken had raised $6.5 million from backers such as Hummingbird Ventures, Blockchain Capital and Digital Currency Group.\n\nFounded in 2011, San Francisco-based Kraken was the first Bitcoin exchange to have trading price and volume displayed on the Bloomberg Terminal, and the first to pass a cryptographically verifiable proof-of-reserves audit. According to the company’s website, Kraken is trusted by hundreds of thousands of traders, the Tokyo government’s court-appointed trustee, and Germany’s Fidor Bank. In October 2014, Fidor Bank and Kraken partnered to create the world’s first cryptocurrency bank.\n\nSiliconANGLE notes that the investment from SBI comes at a busy time from Kraken, following the announcement that it had acquired New York-based Bitcoin exchange Coinsetter Inc. and Canadian exchange Cavirtex in mid-January and the launch of new products in 2015, including a dark pool exchange service and a maker-taker fee model.\n\nBuying Coinsetter is just one part of the equation in order to add volume, noted TechCrunch. Kraken also needs to make it easier to deposit U.S. dollars on the platform. The company is partnering with SynapsePay to allow USD deposits in 37 U.S. states and Washington D.C. for just $5.\n\n“We knew that we wanted to invest in Bitcoin and the blockchain,” said SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao. “We wanted a company that would be a wise strategic investment. Kraken has been a leading global Bitcoin exchange for years. They have grown tremendously during that time while building a strong reputation as one of the most innovative, secure, compliant and reliable companies in this emerging financial services area. Kraken was the clear choice.“\n\nKraken now claims to be the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange by euro volume and transactions, and that in the last two years traders have made more than $1.4 billion in transactions on the platform while trading bitcoin and other digital assets in euros, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds and Canadian dollars.\n\nSBI notes that Kraken is developing blockchain-based financial infrastructure that permits reducing system costs significantly, and dramatically shortening payment processing times, which is attracting attention from the many financial institutions that need to process large volumes of data in short times. The investment represents a vote of confidence in the potential of both blockchain fintech and Kraken.\n\nPhoto via Kraken', '""To me, network effect is the key.""\n\nSo says Saket Sharma, CIO of New York-based financial services firm BNY Mellon\'s Treasury Services unit, as he outlined the bank’s approach to adopting the technology that underlies bitcoin.\n\nLast week, BNY Mellon hosted a day of seminars focused on the blockchain. The event, which drew a small but engaged crowd of BNY employees, followed months of internal development and experimentation that saw the bank pilot its own digital currency and, later, joining a consortium of financial institutions looking to implement the technology.\n\nIn an interview, Sharma argued that collaboration among banks, particularly when it comes to establishing standards of use, will be the driving factor as to whether financial companies begin using blockchains for their services.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""I can come up with a solution that’s great, but [it doesn\'t matter] if I don’t have a network effect – and that’s where I think it’s a combination of the financial industry coming together that will really make this a viable thing if this technology picks up.”\n\nSharma said that all of the business lines within BNY Mellon are looking at possible blockchain applications, but cautioned that the bank sees regulatory and legal questions as an impediment to adoption.\n\n""I think there’s a lot of potential with this technology, and our goal is to really capitalize on the talent in the bank, working collaboratively with others, and play a bigger role in the opportunities there,"" he said.\n\nEducational focus\n\nAccording to Sharma, BNY Mellon began to look into the technology by testing bitcoin and, later, its own kind of digital currency.\n\n""We started with the bitcoin,"" he said. ""We downloaded Bitcoin Core, we modified it, we actually ran it on an internal private cloud,” he said.\n\nThese days, Sharma continued, business units within the bank meet monthly to discuss the results of those blockchain experiments. This, he said, is one product of an effort to establish a culture of experimentation of new technologies within BNY Mellon.\n\nHe explained:\n\n""The question really is, how do we engage the larger BNY community to really start thinking about what is meaningful to us, right? Because to me there are 50,000 use cases but not everything is applicable.""\n\nSharma added that he has pushed for a more ground-up approach to technology testing within the bank, arguing that collaboration between business units or companies is a better way to approach potential business models compared to a top-down, mandate-driven process.\n\n""To me, the culture of innovation doesn’t come from five people sitting in a room and saying I know already. I don’t buy that culture,"" he remarked, going on to say:\n\n""I would rather ignite the process in 50,000 people across an organization.""\n\nStandards push\n\nSharma went on to reiterate that the bank sees the pursuit of standards for the technology as a key priority as the industry moves toward potential adoption.\n\nThis, he said, will enable greater degrees of operability in the event that financial firms operate their own blockchains, pointing to past conversations with startups working in the bitcoin and blockchain space as examples of how the industry hasn’t settled on one solution over another.\n\n""When [Digital Asset Holdings CEO] Blythe Masters came to us last year, she said we have a technology that\'s blockchain agnostic. I was surprised. Is it really? I looked at her and said you don’t have a technology. And two weeks down the line they went and bought Hyperledger,"" said Sharma.\n\nSharma went on to relate a similar experience with bitcoin market data provider TradeBlock. He said that while, during initial conversations, the startup indicated that it used its own proprietary code, the company has since shifted to Ethereum.\n\n""So the underlying technology itself is so fluid that there’s no stack as a standard, right? So unless you have a standard, you will not be able to interoperate, eventually,"" he continued.\n\nBroad view\n\nSharma went on to say that the bank’s look at blockchain applications is part of a wider effort to examine how new forms of financial technology.\n\nHe suggested that the financial services industry is undergoing a significant period of hype, one that could result in significant change – or simply end up as an unfulfilled promise.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""This particular technology is at the peak of the hype cycle at this point in time. When it goes down the slope, you will see real applications coming in. And that’s where the real adoption and the real maturity of it is going to happen.""\n\nFor now, he said, the bank is committed to pursuing use standards through the R3CEV-led bank consortium, as well as promoting more in-house experimentation and education, both in terms of distributed ledgers as well as other forms of financial technology.\n\n""That’s a great opportunity for a bank – and [blockchain technology] is one example,"" he said, adding:\n\n“The idea is to look at all things.”\n\nBNY Mellon Center image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Let’s assume that you are not in one of the many countries that don't have any real regulations or policy regarding Bitcoin ownership and value. If are living in a tax-centric locale like one of the biggest Bitcoin markets, the United States, how do you proceed? Here is a Bitcoin tax obligation overview for the American Bitcoiner. (Please consult professional tax advice before actually paying taxes.)\n\nThere is some good news, so let’s get to that. If you are single, and only make money in Bitcoin, you are not liable for a federal tax obligation until you make at least $9350 for 2015, according to Investopedia and the IRS. You may be required to file federally, regardless of income, if you file as a self-employed individual, making over $400 a year. People below a certain annual income are not required to pay federal income tax, and even filing is not necessary below these thresholds.\n\nThe taxes start if you pass this minimum threshold. Let’s say you made $10k in USD from your Bitcoin services, or made $8k from a part-time job, but made another $2k in Bitcoin, then you will need to file a federal return. The Bitcoin income must declare and be rendered thusly.\n\nAccording to Notice 2014–21, the U.S. Tax Code’s update for 2014, labeled “IRS Virtual Currency Guidance,” If you are an employer paying with Bitcoin, you must report employee earnings to the IRS on W-2 forms. You must convert the Bitcoin value to U.S. dollars as of the date each payment is made and keep careful records. Wages paid in virtual currency are subject to withholding to the same extent as dollar wages.\n\nIf you are an employee paid in Bitcoin and filing federally, you must report your total W-2 wages in dollars, even if earned as Bitcoin. Self-employed individuals with Bitcoin gains or losses from sales transactions also must convert the virtual currency to dollars as of the day earned, and report the figures on their tax returns. Use a price chart that records daily Bitcoin price, like the one from Coindesk, to get these values. There is also tax payment assistance for Bitcoiners like libratax.com, that can help with these potentially complicated details.\n\nIf you hold Bitcoins as an asset, you must treat them as property for tax purposes. Like stocks or bonds, any gain or loss from the sale or exchange of the asset is taxed as a capital gain or loss. Otherwise, the investor realizes ordinary gain or loss on an exchange. If you do not sell or exchange them for another currency or commodity, you’ll be fine.\n\nIf you are a Bitcoin “miner,” here’s how it works. If the taxpayer successfully “mines” Bitcoins and has earnings, in Bitcoins or otherwise, they must include it in his gross income in determining the fair market dollar value of the virtual currency as of the day he received it. If a bitcoin miner is self-employed, his or her gross earnings minus allowable tax deductions are also subject to the self-employment tax."", 'Explaining the appeal of bitcoin to the average American isn\'t easy. Here in the US, it\'s not terribly hard to save, spend, and send money. Most people have bank accounts and credit cards, and when they need to send money to a friend, relative, or acquaintance, they can use any number of online services, from PayPal and Square to SnapChat and Facebook. For most people, bitcoin and other digital currencies looks like a solution in need of a problem—a technological end-run around big banks and big government that interests only geeks, drug dealers, and crazed libertarians.\n\nIndeed, the number of people who use bitcoin as a currency—as opposed to an investment, a bet that its value will rise in time—remains relatively small. The big-name online retailer Overstock.com started accepting bitcoin payments in early 2014, and two years later, the digital currency accounts for no more than 0.1 percent of sales.\n\nExplaining the appeal of bitcoin to the average American isn\'t easy.\n\nBut the calculus changes as you look beyond the US. Bitcoin and other digital currencies like litecoin and dogecoin provide a way of inexpensively moving money across borders, an important alternative to a mainstay like Western Union. Perhaps more importantly, they offer a means of spending and storing money if you don\'t have a bank account or a credit card, which is quite common in the developing world. Nigera is a prime example. According to a 2014 report from Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access—a nonprofit backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that aims to promote financial freedom in Nigeria—just 36 percent of the local population has access to traditional banking services.\n\nThat\'s why Stellar—which operates a kind of meta digital currency that can move practically any form of money across the Internet—is using its technology to create a money transfer network that will span Nigeria and beyond. Working with a company called Oradian, which provides software for small bank-like institutions across Nigeria, Stellar aims to provide an inexpensive means of sending money to friends and family—something that\'s significantly more difficult in a place like West Africa than it is here in the States.\n\n""Money already works fairly well in America and Europe,"" says Stellar founder Jed McCaleb, an early bitcoin thinker who also founded the influential digital currency service Ripple. ""Today, the promise of these digital currencies is most seen in the developing world.""\n\nThe Real Power of Digital Currencies\n\nThis Nigerian network is not something consumers will use on their own—at least not yet. It connects about 20 micro-finance institutions, or MFIs. Essentially, these are companies that provide bank-like services, including loans, to people who don\'t have access to banks. The network allows money to move between these MFIs—something that wasn\'t really possible before—and it provides people with a means of sending and receiving money through them. The two startups say the network is now available to about 300,000 people who already have relationships with these MFIs.\n\n\'Today, if people in the capital want to send money to their family in the countryside, they have to physically put money on a bus, in a bag. That’s not a tenable situation.\'\n\nThese people won\'t necessary hold their own digital currency. Stellar merely provides the infrastructure for exchanging money. By tapping an array of independent computers across the globe, the system lets someone send any currency and have it arrive as any other currency. You can send dollars and have them arrive as bitcoin. You can pay someone in litecoin, and he can receive them as yen. You can send euros and turn them into Chinese yuan. Using this distributed service, Stellar and Oradian provide a cheap way of linking all those Nigerian MFIs.\n\nFor Oradian founder Antonio Separovic, the project reveals the real power of digital currencies—not as a consumer technology, but as underlying infrastructure. ""When people start using the bitcoin blockchain for remittances, that\'s a success,"" says Separovic, who was born in South Africa. ""We\'re telling people they are using Stellar. We\'re telling them they can send now send money.""\n\nStephen Pair, the CEO of bitcoin company Bitpay, which helps merchants accept bitcoin payments in North America, Europe, and Latin America, doesn\'t yet serve Africa. But he agrees that, for bitcoin, the continent presents a huge short-term opportunity. ""There is a huge opportunity for bitcoin to become more mainstream and commonplace in places like that first, before it happens in the developing world,"" he says.\n\nAnyone in the World\n\nStellar\'s network is still just a first step. In order to send and receive money, customers must visit their local MFI. But in a country where money transfers remain arduous, it\'s a notable step. According to Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access, more than half of the 17.5 million Nigerian adults who sent money over a six month period in 2014 used informal channels, such as prepaid debit cards or loved ones who were traveling from place to place.\n\n""Today, if people in the capital want to send money to their family in the countryside, they have to physically put money on a bus, in a bag,"" McCaleb says. ""That\'s not a tenable situation."" In the future, Separovic says, Oradian may explore an app that lets people transfer money entirely on their own.\n\nSimply as a link between MFIs, the new network shows how powerful digital currencies can be in a place like Nigeria—a country with more than 180 million people, or about half that of the US. But the network also provides a way for the MFIs to reach beyond the country. Because the local MFI network plugs into the wider network of Stellar machines, it will let Nigerians swap money with potentially anyone in the world. ""The hope is to include other financial institutions and MFIs over the year to expand the reach of the network,"" McCaleb says.\n\nRemaking the System\n\nThis has long been a strength of bitcoin and other digital currency services. They let you send money across borders without paying the steep fees charged by traditional gatekeepers like Western Union. But the proposition is even more attractive where Africa is concerned. According to the World Bank, the average fee for sending money into Africa is an enormous 12 percent. And the cost of sending money between African countries is even higher.\n\nIn the long run, Pair believes, digital currencies will not only help bootstrap financial services in places like Nigeria, but remake money systems elsewhere in the world. ""It may start in the near- to mid-term going mainstream in some of these emerging markers,"" he says, ""but in the long term, that\'s a catalyst for it going mainstream in more developed places."" Because it provides such an effective means of tracking money and who holds that money at any give time, he argues it can streamline costs everywhere. ""It\'s hard to imagine things working online in any other way than the way bitcoin does it.""\n\nThis doesn\'t necessarily mean the average person will buy stuff with bitcoin. ""They may perceive that they are paying in some other currency,"" Pair says, ""but bitcoin will be the underlying technology that makes this work."" As he sees it, bitcoin—or something like it—will provide the infrastructure that drives our financial system. That\'s still a long way off—if it happens at all. But in places like Nigeria, change is closer.', 'Segregated Witness has become the most talked-about breakthrough in Bitcoin development since the concept was presented in early December to the Scaling Bitcoin Workshop in Hong Kong by Bitcoin Core Developer Pieter Wuille. One of the men that Wuille thanked in the last slide of that presentation was Bitcoin Developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo.\n\nLombrozo gave a presentation on the future of Bitcoin scalability at the recent Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego, where he outlined some of the key benefits of Segregated Witness (SegWit). Although much of the Bitcoin community thinks of SegWit in terms of getting more transactions into each block, the reality is that this innovation offers more than that. When first mentioning this concept to the audience at the San Diego Convention Center, Lombrozo stated:\n\n“This is one of those ideas that – in hindsight – once you understand it, you think this is how it always should have been done.”\n\n1. Stuffing More Transactions Into Blocks\n\nLombrozo first pointed out that most nodes are interested only in the transactions that affect themselves. He explained:\n\n“Scripts take up a lot of space and consume bandwidth. Most nodes are not interested in every single script and every single signature of every transaction on the blockchain. They’re usually mostly interested in the [transactions] that concern them.”\n\nLombrozo explained that SegWit allows nodes to ignore data that they were unlikely to use anyway. He added that this new feature would essentially free up more space for transactions in each new block:\n\n“Every single time that you have to download blocks and transactions, you download all of this data that most nodes are just going to end up throwing away anyway. This can actually give us about two-thirds or more additional space, so we can put [more transactions] in the blockchain.”\n\nAlthough the Bitcoin community has focused on an increase in the block size limit to increase transactional capacity, SegWit is able to achieve the same goal through alternative means.\n\n2. Fixing Transaction Malleability\n\nTransaction malleability has been a thorn in the sides of Bitcoin developers for years. During the collapse of Mt. Gox, Mark Karpeles attempted to blame the loss of customer funds on this issue in the Bitcoin protocol. Transaction malleability has also been used to perform DoS attacks on the Bitcoin network.\n\nDuring his talk, Lombrozo noted that SegWit has the ability to slay the dragon of malleable transactions once and for all:\n\n“It fixes transaction malleability. Now, you can sign transactions independently of transaction identification, so you can construct these very long transaction chains and make it so that the order they get signed in doesn’t matter.”\n\nA fix for transaction malleability is also required for the Lightning Network to function properly, so it’s possible that SegWit will be able to improve Bitcoin’s ability to scale in more ways than one.\n\n3. A Mechanism for Adding New Opcodes\n\nAdding new opcodes to Bitcoin has been a difficult proposition in the past, but SegWit creates a better method of upgrading the scripting language. Lombrozo noted:\n\n“It provides a powerful script upgrade mechanism. Up until now, we really didn’t have a good way to upgrade or add new opcodes to the scripting language.”\n\nLombrozo then took his statement to another level, saying:\n\n“With this, I believe we can actually replace the scripting language entirely with a soft fork.”\n\nOpcodes are what enable various types of transactions on the Bitcoin network. One of the most recent opcodes added to Bitcoin was OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. As a side note, new opcodes are required to bring sidechains functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n4. A More Flexible Security Model\n\nLombrozo also talked about how SegWit can enable new security models for Bitcoin transactions. He explained:\n\n“It makes it possible to add new, partial proofs for future soft forks. This allows for fraud proofs and other kinds of cryptographic proofs, which would allow us to have more flexibility in the security model, so we can decide how much we want to trust other peers and how much we want to validate for ourselves.”\n\nValidation on some transactions can be much lower than others, so it makes sense to allow users to choose the level of security they need in different situations. For example, someone purchasing their morning coffee does not require the same level of validation as a financial institution settling a day’s worth of transactions with another entity. Transactions with less validation can bring more efficiency and scalability to the Bitcoin blockchain, but it’s important to understand the security tradeoffs.\n\n5. Bandwidth Requirements Are Lowered\n\nSegregated Witness also has the potential to decrease bandwidth requirements for SPV nodes. Lombrozo explained this point during his talk:\n\n“When we separate the effects from the scripts and signatures, now we can download these things from different peers at our own leisure – however we want. This allows us to optimize for the peer-to-peer layer significantly, since now we no longer need to be propagating everything all the time. We only propagate the things that are necessary at that moment for the particular peer.”\n\nThere may be some downsides to SegWit, too, but these advantages are hard to ignore. Both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic have plans for implementing this new concept into their respective software clients.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article claimed Segregated Witness lowers bandwidth requirements for full nodes. This is not true, and the decreased need for bandwidth availability only applies to SPV nodes.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

According to the report, which quoted court documents, arresting officers discovered bags “containing Bridges’s passport and a notarized copy of his passport” and Secret Service-issued bulletproof vests that authorities believed had been stolen from the government.\n\nAuthorities also found corporate records for three offshore accounts in Nevis, Belize and Mauritius, the news outlet reported.\n\nBridges was due to start his prison sentence on the day after his arrest, according to reports. Last year, the former federal agent pleaded guilty to money laundering and obstruction of justice, diverting more than $820,000 worth of bitcoin to his personal account during the course of the investigation of online black market Silk Road.\n\nIn his plea, Bridges admitted that he funneled the 20,000 bitcoins through a series of “complex transactions” before converting them into U.S. dollars in May 2013.\n\nBridges was part of a task force investigating Silk Road along with former Drug Enforcement Administration agent Carl Force. Force, who pleaded guilty to similar charges and extortion in July last year, created an unauthorized alias to extort $250,000 from Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht and then offered to sell information about the investigation for $100,000.\n\nUlbricht ran the website under the name Dead Pirate Roberts between 2011 and 2013, when he was caught red-handed by a law enforcement sting in a San Francisco coffee shop. The Texan was sentenced to life in prison on charges of drug trafficking, money laundering and a whole host of other cybercrimes.\n\nMeanwhile, federal authorities also arrested Roger Thomas Clark in Thailand late last year. The Canadian, who also went by the name Variety Jones, is believed to be a close confidante of Ulbricht.\n\nU.S. prosecutors said Clark advised the Silk Road owner on all aspects of the website’s operations and also “helped him grow the site into an extensive criminal enterprise.”\n\nComments', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

02/03/2016,"['The EU’s executive body has promised new legislation in the Spring to make sure the exchanges and users of virtual currency platforms such as Bitcoin are identifiable and traceable.\n\nThe reason? Terrorism. The move was announced as part of a raft of measures to make it harder for terrorists and their backers to move around funds and other assets.\n\n“We want to improve the oversight of the many financial means used by terrorists, from cash and cultural artefacts to virtual currencies and anonymous pre-paid cards, while avoiding unnecessary obstacles to the functioning of payments and financial markets for ordinary, law-abiding citizens,” said European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis.\n\nWhat will this mean in practice? The new legislation would force virtual currency platforms to apply more due diligence controls when customers are exchanging virtual for real currencies, by bringing them under the scope of EU anti-money-laundering laws.\n\nThe proposals will be set out in full by mid-year, with the aim of making them law across the EU by the end of 2017.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nBye-bye Bitcoin anonymity — at least, in theory.\n\nMany exchanges for Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies operate outside the European Union, putting them out of this legislation’s reach. And once hard cash has been converted into such “cryptocurrencies,” it’s inherently tricky to track the subsequent transactions.\n\nIt does seem to be the case that terrorists sometimes use Bitcoin. A report (PDF) released by the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force last October included a case study of a terrorist supporter who used Twitter to tell people how to donate bitcoins to terrorists.\n\n\u200b\n\nFor more on Bitcoin, watch:\n\nHowever, as the report also stated: “The actual prevalence and level of exploitation of these technologies by terrorist groups and their supporters is not clear at this time and remains an ongoing information gap to be explored.” While services such as Bitcoin pose a potential threat, they have nothing on more traditional funding methods, self-funding in particular.\n\nStill, the Paris attacks last November created an atmosphere in which the European Commission must be seen to be doing what it can. For virtual currencies, this is the fallout.', 'Blockstream has raised $55m in Series A funding to continue its work expanding the bitcoin code base for commercial use.\n\nWith the news, Blockstream\'s total funding rises to $76m over two investment rounds. To date, the company\'s signature technology has been its sidechains offering, currently in testing, which enables the creation of blockchains that can validate data from, and transfer assets to, other blockchains.\n\nBlockstream’s round was led by venture capital firms AXA Strategic Ventures, the venture capital arm of French multinational insurance firm AXA Group; Digital Garage, the Tokyo-based online payments firm co-founded by Joi Ito; and Hong Kong venture capital firm Horizons Ventures.\n\nAME Cloud Ventures, Blockchain Capital and Future\\Perfect Ventures were among other investment firms that participated in the deal.\n\nGiven the recent interest in private and permissioned blockchains, Blockstream sought to underscore the versatility of its technology as well as its early efforts to bring added functionality to the bitcoin network through interoperable blockchains.\n\nBlockstream CEO Austin Hill told CoinDesk:\n\n""We were one of the first companies that painted a vision for interoperable blockchains, that there wasn’t going to be one blockchain, but many of them, all building off the bitcoin codebase to deliver the technology.""\n\nStill, Hill said the company remains dedicated to developing technology for the open-source bitcoin blockchain, which it called the ""most mature, well-tested and secure"" infrastructure for blockchain services.\n\n""What we would hate to see happen is the most robust and secure blockchain protocol getting left by the wayside if people moved on to different protocols and tech stacks that bitcoin isn’t designed for,"" Hill continued, adding:\n\n""We believe there is a benefit to society to have all these blockchains be interoperable.""\n\nBitcoin and blockchain\n\nIn particular, Hill cited the recent decision by blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings to use Blockstream’s tech as part of its Open Ledger Project, an open-source blockchain initiative being overseen by the Linux Foundation, as an example how the bitcoin codebase can become more relevant for commercial applications.\n\nNotably, the fundraising follows the revelation that Digital Asset itself had raised more than $60m in a round from fourteen major banks. Following on the heels of this announcement, Hill acknowledged there may be an impulse on the part of the market to compare the rounds.\n\nOn one hand, Digital Asset was able to attract 14 major banks and IBM for its permissioned or private blockchain solutions, whereas Blockstream’s round includes mostly venture capital firms and its technology is targeted toward the bitcoin network.\n\nHowever, Hill doesn’t see the companies as competitive or the rounds as illustrative of any gap in how global investors are reacting to the technology\n\n""There are times when we compete for opportunities, but we collaborate with the guys at Digital Asset. They give us feedback on our code, we have meetings with them to show common architecture,"" Hill continued.\n\nHe went on to emphasize that the groups remain focused on very different opportunities given the backgrounds and expertise of their respective team members.\n\n""There are some parts that they’re focusing on that are not our expertise or focus. We’re happy to see syndicated loans emerge on a blockchain, but we have a whole different background,"" he added.\n\nBoost for bitcoin\n\nHill went on to position the round as a vote of confidence for the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, arguing that he believes bitcoin’s code base will become widely used, even by private or permissioned blockchain solutions due to its proven functionality.\n\n""Bitcoin is the most mature blockchain protocol. It’s had a running $2bn-$7bn security bounty, the largest bounty ever placed on a protocol, for years, and that gives people confidence,"" Hill explained.\n\nAs such, Hill suggested Blockstream’s value proposition will be in its ability to adapt bitcoin’s codebase for other production use cases such as Liquid, its product aimed at improving transaction speeds for traders and exchanges.\n\nIn turn, Hill said he expects bitcoin\'s code to be used similarly by more firms, even as they adapt blockchain tech for enterprise use cases.\n\n“There are some people who are taking the approach of starting to code something brand new, we haven’t seen any of those in production,” he said, adding:\n\n""We see this often when we talk to customers and investors, they see us as a great building block in developing the work in the open-source [bitcoin] community for other use cases.""\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream.\n\nImage via Blockstream\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce said in a recent interview that although there are legitimate concerns with the current state of Bitcoin mining, the blockchain-focused venture capitalist indicated China’s stranglehold on the mining process will not last forever.\n\nPierce was interviewed on the most recent episode of This Week in Startups, where he was asked about the issue of bitcoin mining centralization. The source of the question appeared to be Mike Hearn’s farewell Medium post in which the former Bitcoin developer claimed the Bitcoin payment network is “controlled by China.”\n\nPierce Would Not Invest in a Chinese Bitcoin Mining Operation\n\nPierce said bitcoin mining in China is probably not always sanctioned by the Chinese government. In fact, Pierce suspects various mining operations in the country may be going on without the government’s knowledge and behind closed doors.\n\nPierce said he would not invest in one of these mining operations due to the legal uncertainty surrounding them.\n\nHe noted:\n\n“In China, you’ve got a lot of the hydro dams. They offer one to two – we’ll call it two to four megawatt facilities. The problem you have in China is you’re not allowed to buy energy from anyone except for the government, and so when these deals are being done, they’re being done outside of the government, so they’re probably in violation of the law. There’s some risks there about its long-term sustainability. I would not be comfortable investing in one of those operations because there’s a bunch of risk factors there that I don’t know how to quantify.”\n\nIn Pierce’s view, the fact that these operations may not have the blessing of the local government could impact their long-term viability as profitable investments.\n\nBitcoin Mining May Not Scale in China\n\nPierce said the legal ambiguity surrounding Bitcoin mining in China also means it may not be able to continue to scale with increased Bitcoin adoption over time. Pierce put Bitcoin mining’s scalability in China into question due to his belief that this is not something being financed by the Chinese government:\n\n“The question is: Are they stealing? Are they circumventing? In some cases, are there backdoor deals? And obviously, these sorts of things do happen in that region. There are those risks where, long term, I wonder how scalable it can get because I don’t believe this is like – I don’t believe the Chinese government has decided this is a matter of national security and are financing this. I believe this is a lot of sort of backdoor dealing and guys hustling to make a buck.”\n\nAn inability to scale to much larger levels of hashing power would likely mean the rest of the world would eventually catch up to China and retake majority control of the overall network hashrate. Pierce pointed to BitFury and KnCMiner as two companies that could eventually help bring more of the Bitcoin network’s hashing power outside of China.\n\nNot a Long-term Risk\n\nPierce said the China-related question is this is not an issue that keeps him up at night.\n\nHe noted:\n\n“I don’t go, ‘Oh, this is a long-term, legitimate risk.’ … I don’t think China has a monopoly.”\n\nAnd besides, Pierce noted, there wouldn’t be much to worry about even if the majority of mining continued to take place in China. In his view, Bitcoin’s incentive structure persuades everyone in the system to act properly.\n\nHe explained:\n\n“The thing that I rely on more than anything else is more than a contract; it’s an alignment of incentives. How do the the Chinese miners that are investing all this money and hustling to make a buck benefit by destroying Bitcoin? The most important thing that I think we have as an industry is everybody’s interests are aligned that are currently investing in this.”\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

This hasn\'t stopped the EU from moving ahead with its plans.\n\nBy bringing virtual currency exchange platforms under the scope of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive, the EU will have the legal power to force these companies to comply with existing regulation regarding customer due diligence, which means tracking their identity and income source.\n\nPre-paid cards will no longer be anonymous either\n\nBesides Bitcoin transactions, the European Commission is also planning to remove the shroud of anonymity from pre-paid cards as well, intending to widen customer verification requirements, something that Romania has already been thinking of doing.\n\n""We want to improve the oversight of the many financial means used by terrorists, from cash and cultural artefacts to virtual currencies and anonymous pre-paid cards, while avoiding unnecessary obstacles to the functioning of payments and financial markets for ordinary, law-abiding citizens,"" said Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, in charge of the Euro and Social Dialogue Commission.\n\nBitcoin users will surely not be happy about this AMLD amendment proposal, since anonymity was one of Bitcoin\'s most appealing features.', 'Strange times we live in. The world’s biggest financial players and analysts are buzzing about an invention that became famous partly by promising to destroy them.\n\nIn just a few months, blockchain went from the cause célèbre of crypto-anarchists and tech evangelists to the biggest idea in mainstream banking. We’ve seen a steady stream of blockchain news: five more banks joined the massive R3 consortium (its membership reads like a who’s-who of global finance), Nasdaq announced its first share transaction on blockchain and the Australian stock exchange announced it would test blockchain for trade settlement.\n\nThe irony is that blockchain gained worldwide prominence because of bitcoin — and many bitcoin supporters think that cryptocurrency spells the downfall of the global banking system. But today, the buzz is about the blockchain — a type of consensus-based computing that underpins bitcoin and other services.\n\nA blockchain is a record of digital events that is cryptographically impossible to fake or manipulate. Financial firms are exploring a number of uses, from transfers to clearing mechanisms to intra-bank settlements. The idea is to create a shared infrastructure, where many of these transactions (that now can take days) can settle instantly and transparently.\n\nBut what few insiders seem willing to admit is that, like similar projects, this effort will face some daunting institutional challenges that make near-term success unlikely.\n\nThe biggest of these challenges is obvious: Banks today make huge profits on financial transactions. If transfers suddenly became instantaneous and worry-free, who would pay a bank to facilitate them? The former head of Barclays technology thinks the current interest in blockchain is “cynical.” He claims banks want to exert control, rather than drive meaningful reforms.\n\nPersonally, I think the problems are more mundane. I’ve been working with blockchains since 2008. As a former derivatives trader, I certainly understand the excitement for value-based transactions. However, near-term success there doesn’t seem promising.\n\nFor one, most banks have massive infrastructure debt in financial processing systems. These systems could be 15, 20 years old. But they power transactions between the world’s major businesses and governments; disrupting them, even for a short time, could be disastrous. Trying to overhaul them altogether is a tall order, and comes with huge risk. I doubt that many people within banks want to take responsibility for that, especially when it’s entirely outside the existing business model.\n\nAnother problem is with priorities. Banks already have a huge technology headache: keeping pace with the web of global regulations. This is an immensely challenging, high stakes and constantly shifting landscape; it will always be first priority for banks and their technology departments. When so much energy and budget go to keeping regulators off your back, it’s hard to justify diverting resources to a completely unrelated issue.\n\nThe push to rethink the global financial system is, at present, little more than a collection of ideas and incubators.\n\nBut the main problem is that institutionally, banks are not wired to drive this kind of innovation. Quite simply: bureaucracy. Lawyers, compliance, front office, back office, middle office — enacting meaningful reform, or even getting budget to expand a technology program, could require sign-off from all of them. This is necessary in the high-stakes financial world, but undoubtedly a barrier to innovation. If blockchain programs ever leave the incubators, they’ll have to justify themselves up and down the line.\n\nImagine approaching all these stakeholders and convincing them to go all-in on a new technology that’s widely celebrated by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. And now add this caveat: This project could overturn the very fundamentals of our business, and some of our biggest profit drivers! Not an easy sell.\n\nMany people are looking to Silicon Valley for answers, and we’ve seen a run of blockchain startups. A startup can avoid these institutional problems for a time (while getting press attention and funding). But eventually they will have to integrate with the existing financial infrastructure. At that point, these hot companies are going to run up against the reality of the banking system. And I worry that a lot of investors will be disappointed.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the blockchain is big. Really big. Investments in bitcoin and blockchain infrastructure just topped $1 billion, and every major bank in the world is paying attention. But as with any new technology, people are still figuring out the best applications. And right now, financial exchanges are a tough nut to crack.\n\nOn the other hand, blockchains are more than just money. You can record any kind of data there, and create an ironclad record of everything that happens to it. This can be a powerful tool against fraud, which costs banks billions of dollars a year. And it can transform how banks demonstrate compliance with laws, regulations and customer contracts; blockchains allow outsiders to verify properties of data (its location, for example, or who has accessed it) without giving away sensitive information about the data itself.\n\nAnd although it’s not as sexy, security may be the most promising blockchain application. By registering digital assets there (anything from financial data to system configurations), you can protect them against unauthorized changes. Manipulating those digital assets is exactly how attackers breached JPMorgan’s system in 2014, stealing personal data about nearly 100 million households.\n\nBanks lose billions of dollars to fraud and hacking every year, and compliance is a constant headache. These kinds of blockchain solutions are much nearer at hand, and they can integrate with existing banking processes.\n\nOn the other hand, the push to rethink the global financial system is, at present, little more than a collection of ideas and incubators — in an industry that’s notoriously resistant to change. I think that day will come, but even enthusiasts need to recognize that financial overhaul faces a long, hard road to success.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', 'Amid the current global economic turmoil the largely misunderstood and somewhat maligned cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has come into the spotlight as a realistic foil for existing payment methods. While the Bitcoin debate rages, fuelled by the emergence of the mistifying Blockchain, the trend is clear: more and more people are using it. This is evident in the 236,175 transactions per day seen in January.\n\nCryptocurrency experts with their feet firmly planted in emerging and developed markets believe that the Bitcoin adoption curve is about to head northwards. Their assertion is that more merchants will start accepting it, especially when the benefits of fast transactions and low fees enter the equation. “As more people use and accept Bitcoin, it creates positive feedback loops for usage and trust, which helps grow the industry. At some point we believe it will hit a critical mass that will cause growth to become exponential,” says Werner van Rooyen, head of business development and growth at BitX.\n\nBitX is a Singapore-based global Bitcoin platform, with offices in Cape Town, that was founded in 2013.\n\nVan Rooyen says markets on either end of the wealth spectrum are starting to grasp the potential of cryptocurrencies. “Since Bitcoin is currently seen as a bit of a luxury, we see the majority of trading and investment currently happening in richer countries, notably the United States. Those markets already have excellent, established financial services – which Bitcoin certainly can complement – but we expect the biggest benefits will accrue to users in emerging markets, where Bitcoin can solve real pain points.”\n\nPractical applications\n\nThe practical applications for the cryptocurrency have advanced considerably in the last five years. This can be seen in the way e-commerce has magnetised toward the security of Bitcoin. For example, a merchant in Johannesburg who is selling to customers in Botswana (or Barbados, for that matter) wouldn’t have all the issues associated with fraud and time-delays in getting paid for their goods and services.\n\nDespite the expansion in trade that we’ve seen over the years, most payments are still predominantly restricted by a certain geography or currency and it’s difficult for medium-sized merchants to receive payments from international buyers. Bitcoin is changing this.\n\nLocal barriers to entry\n\nCharles Elliman, head of business development at PayU EMEA does not believe that the barriers to adoption are unique to South Africa. “As with any new technology, but especially for matters related to finance, it takes time for people to develop trust. In this case, trust in the cryptocurrency, and in companies that provide Bitcoin services.”\n\nAnother issue is that it takes some work to trade in Bitcoins. Werner van Rooyen explains, “There is also a fair amount of effort involved in obtaining Bitcoins; in the same way you just can’t walk up to any shop in South Africa and buy US dollars, for example. There are some hurdles before someone can purchase their Bitcoins.”\n\nVan Rooyen says online payment providers can play an important part in lowering the hurdles to transacting in Bitcoins. “Bitcoin is a natural progression of payments, especially online payments, due to its digital nature. Payment processors like PayU can help provide more avenues for merchants to allow their customers to pay with Bitcoins (helping them reduce fraud risk, lower fees (and therefore generating more profits) and gain access to new markets and customers), but for those merchants to still get paid in their local currency i.e. hedging out the volatility risk of Bitcoins. In short, companies like PayU, partnering with companies like BitX, can help bring merchants to the new digital age.”\n\nSouth African adoption of Bitcoin\n\nPayU’s Elliman says, “For South Africa to become a catalyst for adoption in the region, South African e-ommerce adoption needs to start uptrending closer to that of Asia and for companies like BitX and PayU to help educate people and make the overall customer experience better, all within the right regulatory frameworks.”\n\nVan Rooyen says BitX is up for the challenge and is putting a lot of effort into having the cryptocurrency become a more regular means of payment. “We are working hard every day on our relationship with consumers, businesses, banks and regulators all across the globe and working at finding ways of lowering the barriers of adoption.”\n\nStaff writer\n\n« The importance of speed and adjusting to customer needs Challenges to Building a Future-Oriented Network »', '""Bitcoin needs mass adoption."" This is a phrase you see very often on Reddit and in Bitcoin conversations all over the world.\n\nThere are lots of discussions on the internet and a lot of thinking on the part of basic internet users as to whether they should adopt Bitcoin or not. Many companies have built themselves a future in the economic sector with Bitcoin’s technology, raising millions of dollars, having followed the age-old saying, “If you don\'t try it, how could you know it?”.\n\nOur correspondent, Marinos Kokkinos, reached out to Mr. Kevin Barnes, the Chairman of Playcoin Entertainment Corporation, a Blockchain solution provider.\n\nHe has a clear view on the matter and said:\n\n“Adopted like a commodity like gold, it will take time to prove itself. Adoption as a currency for transactions, it will have to be adopted by most all merchant processors like visa and mastercard. Just my opinion :)”.\n\nMost of those in possession of Bitcoin are of this same mindset.\n\nRecently, it was announced that Bitstamp added a new option to all their user accounts - a new withdrawal option! You can convert USD to physical gold, and have it delivered to your door in a fully insured shipment.\n\nOn the same topic, our correspondent, Marinos Kokkinos, reached out to Mr. Tim Frost, VP of Marketing and Business Development at e-coin. He is inspired by the Blockchain’s decentralised technology. His company is dedicated to growing the popularity and usability of cryptocurrency, trying to make the transactions simple, safe and hassle-free. His view on the matter is:\n\n“I feel it’s still very difficult to buy, sell and acquire Bitcoin. I believe a larger percentage of the public is interested in having Bitcoin, but it’s still difficult to acquire and use it. I believe companies such as ours who offer the ability to use Bitcoin anywhere with our E-Coin Bitcoin debit card is helping it become more practical and useful. As companies continue to merge the divide between traditional finance methods and Bitcoin adoption will increase. Until Bitcoin is widely accepted I believe we need to continue to build on existing infrastructures.”\n\nMr. Goutama Bachtiar, adviser, consultant, investigator and auditor with global exposures in Fintech realms, made a clear statement on the matter, offering a different point of view to many others:\n\n“From what I’ve been observing for quite a while, I see Bitcoin as more of a framework, rather than merely a currency or even a payment network.”\n\nHe continues:\n\n“To drive it to become adoptable, the mainstream must perceive Bitcoin as much (not only) better service than those alternatives out there in the aspects of usefulness, simplicity, liquidity, safety, and being less volatile – all unveiled in chronological order based on their weights. On the other hand, as time flies, such a big hope that we need to see (more and more) governments to acknowledge it as their official currency.”\n\nFinally, another point of view from the depths of development is from Dr. Gavin Andresen, well known in the world of Bitcoin. He shares his thoughts on the matter:\n\n“The biggest problem of Bitcoin is: how do people get it as part of their everyday life? I don\'t know the answer: I received my wages in Bitcoin, but most companies will not be paying people in Bitcoin any time soon. And if most people don\'t have Bitcoin to spend, how will it become a major payment system?”\n\nTo conclude, while it is very important that people not involved in the world of Bitcoin spare a minute to consider its possibility and think of it as a new kind of approach, skepticism for its adoption on a large scale is bound to occur, meanwhile only a few people involved in Bitcoin have the knowledge and responsibility to drive its future. However, we must also recognise and praise the enormous gains we have made in the legitimization of Bitcoin and the Blockchain. Not only that, but the ways in which it has changed our very way of thinking.', 'SatoshiPay, an online payments company headquartered in London, announced the launch of a platform for Web publishers, offering a new way to monetize content through frictionless micropayments.\n\nSatoshiPay’s payment technology gives users the ability to transact amounts as small as one cent or less – which the company refers to as “nanopayments” – by leveraging blockchain technology.\n\n“Nanopayments can be fractions of a cent. They are instantly settled and can be executed at high frequency. Imagine a couple of payments per second by a single user,” said SatoshiPay co-founder and CEO Meinhard Benn. “This enables completely new ways of monetizing Web content and digital goods in general. In an increasingly digital society, nanopayments allow for new business models that existing payment technology cannot facilitate due to its fee structure and trust models.”\n\nSatoshiPay Ltd. is headquartered in London and development is done through the Berlin subsidiary SatoshiPay Germany UG, founded by Benn, Henning Peters and Kilian Thalhammer in 2014. In July 2015, the company won second prize at Coinbase Bithack.\n\n“SatoshiPay is a bitcoin nanopayment wall for publishers which allows you to pay for the section of text that really interests you, make metered payments for streaming video, and make paid downloads with a single click,” noted the Coinbase announcement. SatoshiPay recently announced that it closed a €360,000 seed funding round.\n\n“SatoshiPay would like to become a standard for paying for digital goods on the Web,” Benn told Bitcoin Magazine. “It’s widely assumed that micro or nanopayments are one of the applications that could become Bitcoin’s killer-app. We strongly agree and we hope that we built a use case that can prove this.”\n\nMicropayments are difficult to implement with traditional payment systems, because the overhead costs (transaction fees) would be too high. But fast micropayments with the low transaction fees permitted by Bitcoin enable alternative models for paid online content.\n\nWe are used to a “free” Internet where nobody has to pay, but, of course, there is no such thing as a free lunch. The price that we pay for free email is spam, and the price that we pay for free content is rampant advertising – often annoying, intrusive, and ugly – or registration to websites that could sell their registered users list to spammers. Needless to say, many users install ad-blockers and don’t register to websites with mandatory sign-up. The company recommends trying the SatoshiPay model as an alternative to ads and registration.\n\nIn SatoshiPay there is no registration, and payments are done with one click or tap. The user can also choose to pay for content completely automatically. The balance of the user’s SatoshiPay wallet is displayed in the SatoshiPay’s floating Web widget at the bottom of the publisher’s website (example here). The user’s balance is shared across all websites that integrate with the SatoshiPay widget, and a user interface to manage SatoshiPay wallets is in the works. Publishers can join the SatoshiPay nanopayment network and install a Wordpress plugin, and more options for both publishers and users are expected to be available later on.\n\n“A lot of people are talking about how smart contracts and payment channels can power tomorrow’s applications,” Benn told Bitcoin Magazine. We’ve built something that is already very useful today.”\n\nFlorian Glatz, a developer who is also SatoshiPay’s lawyer, wrote an article to explain how SatoshiPay is prototyping innovative uses of smart contracts “to change the Internet economy forever.” The SatoshiPay service is a trustless intermediary that mediates contractual negotiations and performance between buyers and sellers of digital goods, without those parties having to trust the service with their money, by implementing micropayment channels built on 2-of-2 multisig addresses and the nLockTime property.\n\nThe SatoshiPay service seems a clever and streamlined way to monetize online content without annoying readers, and the first impression is that it could really change the Internet economy once it achieves a critical mass of users and publishers.\n\n“We automatically generate a Bitcoin wallet for each website visitor – without them even knowing,” Benn told Bitcoin Magazine. “When users that were previously not familiar with Bitcoin realize they have a wallet now, they might be curious to learn more about Bitcoin and its other applications. So besides being an easy-to-use payment tool, our product also helps to spread the word. As someone on Twitter put it: Blockchain is moving into publishing.”\n\n“Go to satoshipay.io and show me your QR code,” is Benn’s message to people that wonder how to get bitcoins. “I will send you some bitcoins right now and you can start using them. There is no on-boarding.”']"
02/04/2016,"['Public, private or permissioned?\n\nThe argument over which type of blockchain technology platform will gain market share continues to be a point of analysis for industry observers.\n\nSo far, major banks have cast their vote, lining up to invest big money in private or permissioned blockchain tech startups like Digital Asset Holdings and Ripple, which have together raised nearly $100m from investors including CME Group and JP Morgan & Chase.\n\nHowever, with Blockstream’s latest $55m Series A, the startup is emerging as a well-capitalized counterpoint to these companies, promoting the commercialization of blockchain tech not through proprietary bitcoin alternatives but through products and services that aim to build on what it describes as the battle-tested bitcoin code base.\n\nComments from participating venture capital firms suggest the message that the bitcoin blockchain will be able to compete against alternatives for commercial applications is resonating.\n\nManish Agarwal, general partner at AXA Strategic Ventures, for example, said he believes that there is a future in commercial use cases for public blockchains.\n\nAgarwal told CoinDesk:\n\n”We believe that the blockchain technology has the potential to dramatically reshape the financial services landscape. The public blockchain is a key part of that, in my view. We are not that interested in the actual bitcoin as a currency, but the tech is the key.”\n\nThe comments were echoed by Rocky Eda, head of communications at Digital Garage, which had previously only discussed bitcoin publicly as part of a conference held in Japan.\n\n""Linux dominates operating systems compared to proprietary [versions]. I think the same thing will happen with blockchain,"" he said. ""The open-source community is very tested.""\n\nThe comments echoed remarks by Blockstream CEO Austin Hill, who indicated in a blog post that the round aims to give his startup the resources to continue building an open-source infrastructure that would ""re-architect the very dynamics underpinning trust globally"".\n\nOpen-source alternative\n\nInvestors in the round were keen to express their belief that both permissioned and public blockchains will exist side-by-side, but that the bitcoin blockchain is a key part of this future.\n\nBrad Stephens, managing partner at Blockchain Capital, said he believes the round will enable the ""sustained development of the bitcoin protocol"" as a component to this larger vision.\n\n""While we envision a multi-chain future, the bitcoin blockchain is the most secure, most robust blockchain with network effect benefits,"" he remarked.\n\nOthers see Blockstream’s sidechains product as being able to replicate the functionality of permissioned blockchains, albeit with the benefits of bitcoin\'s open-source code base as a foundation.\n\nEda said that he believes there is opportunity for sidechains technology to be used by companies developing applications for rewards points schemes or smart contracts in Japan.\n\n""Sidechains are the best solution to develop applications of blockchain technology, compared to the private blockchain that’s very proprietary and closed,"" he said.\n\nAgarwal further suggested that he sees sidechains as having a value proposition that is closer to the original intent of the bitcoin blockchain, and that he believes this will be more appealing to entities seeking to leverage blockchain tech.\n\nHe added:\n\n""I believe a lot of the value in the technology is in the trustless nature and I think open-source validation is crucial for that.""\n\nRoom for competition\n\nYet another signal that Blockstream’s blockchain-first approach to bitcoin development may be resonating with a wider audience is that its code is set to be leveraged by Digital Asset Holdings and the Linux Foundation as part of the Open Ledger Project.\n\nFuture\\Perfect Ventures founding partner Jalak Jobanputra said that she sees such collaborations as evidence the blockchain-focused groups have complementary expertise, and that open-source code development will be key to all manner of blockchain efforts.\n\n""Digital Asset was founded to focus on the financial market. It had a very clear mandate, they know the vertical extremely well. I view Blockstream as more of an infrastructure provider, as Digital Asset is using the tech they are producing,"" she said.\n\nJobanputra voiced the common refrain that any attention paid to the nascent bitcoin and blockchain market can be seen as a positive given that there are so many varied use cases for the technology.\n\n""These large rounds you’re seeing are because people are grasping the potential more, and want to participate in the upside,"" she continued.\n\nStephens agreed, saying that ""all blockchain companies"" benefit from the open-source development and volunteer work on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Our view is that there will be certain applications where private technologies are what the customer wants.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The latest individual, or in this case, pair of individuals suspected of being Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, has denied accusations. Pawel Pszona, a Polish programmer was believed by username BountyHunter2012 to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Pszona published a Master’s thesis paper in 2007 as a student with the help of his professor Dr. Grzegorz Stachowiak titled “Unlinkable Divisible Digital Cash without Trusted Third Party.”\n\nBesides a vaguely similar ethos shared between Pszona’s publication and that behind Bitcoin, two Japanese cryptographers with the names of Toru Nakanishi and Tatsuaki Okamoto were found in the bibliography of the thesis. It was asserted that Nakanishi and Okamoto’s surnames were merged to form “Nakamoto” and “Satoshi” was likely just a random Japanese first name added to form the Bitcoin creator’s pseudonym.\n\nThe Bounty Hunter’s blog has pegged others for being potential “usual suspects” in the search for Satoshi Nakamoto, those including Hal Finney, Nick Szabo, Craig Wright and more. After receiving personal emails from Pszona stating that he was not the creator of Bitcoin and after Stachowiak told the press he too wasn’t involved with the creation of Bitcoin, the final blog post asserting their hidden identities was deleted.\n\nIn other recent “unmaskings” we’ve seen a lot of speculation to Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity with little material benefit from the ongoing search. Many people feel that the true identity of the Bitcoin creator isn’t actually important, and more importantly, believe that someone who seeks sustained anonymity should have it.\n\nIn a post on Hacker News, Mike Hearn, a recently subject of Bitcoin controversy after a blog post he wrote, pointed out why outings like this are “entertaining” to him:\n\n“The quality of these “unmaskings” has been getting lower over time…The paper he cites from 2007 describes a system nothing like Bitcoin. Digital cash papers have been coming out every year for decades, it’s always been a hot topic of research in the field of cryptography, since the days of Chaum. You could pick almost any time in any year and find some e-cash paper like that one.”\n\nHearn goes on in his post to point out some of the reasons he feels Bitcoin is truly unique and has had as much success as it has. With these points in mind, it’s difficult to see how an exposure of the true identity of Bitcoin’s creator would affect the economic, financial and social challenges that Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are trying to overcome. While it’s natural that many people feel an innate curiosity and passion to figure out who Satoshi Nakamoto is, it may just be better for the hopes of long-term and widespread adoption that we focus on the technology and revolutionary aspects of Bitcoin rather than the personality behind it.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Russia has never been keen on Bitcoin by any means, which has lead to a varied history of banning the digital currency and unbanning it with strict controls in place.

By saying how Bitcoin could be a threat to Russian national economy, corrective labor for participating in the digital currency ecosystem is not unthinkable in the future.\n\nAlso read: DH Corporation Brings Private Blockchain Solution To Global PAYplus\n\nRussian Ministry of Finance Fears Bitcoin\n\nThe concept of Bitcoin itself can cause a significant revolution in the financial world as we know it. Needless to say, various countries around the world are looking for solutions to regulate the growth of Bitcoin, although they may stifle innovation along the way. Russia is taking a very aggressive stance towards the popular digital currency, which could lead to jail time if the proposal is approved.\n\nBased on the statement by the Russian Ministry of Finance, Bitcoin is a major threat to the country’s national security and economy. This opinion is shared by various Russian financial experts, and a legislative proposal has been created to enforce penalty charges of up to 500,000 rubles. Furthermore, officials could turn this punishment into a two-year corrective labor sentence as well.\n\nIt is not the first time Russia and Bitcoin clash heads throughout the years, as the government is very strict when it comes to financial matters. Not too long ago, several Russian Bitcoin websites were made inaccessible by the country’s watchdog service. That decision was overturned in court later on, although it was only a sign of things to come.\n\nAssuming Bitcoin and other digital currencies become subject to criminal punishment, things are not looking all that great in Russia. At the same time, this Ministry of Finance proposal can create an adverse effect and hurt the Russian economy even more. While there is nothing wrong with trying to regulate Bitcoin on paper, resorting to jail sentences and hefty fines should be a last resort.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not the Ministry of Finance proposal will become a part of Russian law in the future, though. Lyudmila Bokova of the Federation Council’s Constitutional Committee is not in favor of banning digital currency and feels how the Russian government should work on proper regulatory measures instead.\n\nPeople Need A Way Out of Falling Ruble\n\nThis announcement comes at a time where the Russian economy is taking a serious beating from international markets as of late. The Russian Ruble has been losing a significant portion of it value in recent times, and the charts are not indicating a road to recovery just yet. Based on the graphs for the past year, the Russian Ruble has dropped from 0.02055 USD to 0.01317 USD per RUB.\n\nBitcoin provides an excellent backup plan for both residents and investors, as the digital currency is a convenient way to transfer value around the world and between different fiat currencies. In fact, Bitcoin can even be traded against precious metals on several exchanges, making it a perfect candidate for portfolio diversification.\n\nSource: RG', 'Brand owners seeking to protect their intellectual property online face a new front in the digital world: the Deep Web and the darknets contained within it.\n\nAbuse in the Deep Web can be broad and hidden, with cybersquatters and fraudsters trying to ply their trade. However, once detected, there are means to identify the perpetrators and to enforce IP rights. The anonymity and hidden nature of a darknet allow under-the-radar trade in mass quantities of counterfeit goods alongside illicit drugs and weapons, and present special challenges to law enforcement agencies and brand owners.\n\nUnderstanding the internet landscape\n\nThe Internet is divided into two sections. The ‘Surface Web’ is composed of regular websites that are indexed and searched with standard search engines. However, this represents only 4% of the Internet. The remaining 96% is a vast, uncharted ocean known as the ‘Deep Web’. This is comprised of websites that are not indexed by any search engines. In other words, a standard search engine will not access the content of 96% of the Internet – as with an iceberg, most of the content is hidden below the surface, on un-indexed websites. When you browse the Internet, you are really just floating on the surface. Underneath the surface, trillions of pages exist that the search engines never see.\n\nDarknets, unlike the Deep Web, are networks that overlay the public Internet and can be accessed only via specific software. There are two types of darknet: friend-to-friend or peer-to-peer networks (which are used for file sharing) and large, popular anonymous networks such as Tor, Freenet and I2P.\n\nWhat is in the Deep Web?\n\nThe Deep Web is estimated to be 500 times the size of the Surface Web, containing more than 7,500 terabytes of content. So, why is this content hidden from search engines? Much content remains un-indexed for legitimate reasons, such as a corporate internet behind a firewall. Most of the content on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter is hidden behind a log-in page. There are also vast databases of information in places such as the US Patent and Trademark Office that are not indexed.\n\nThere is also a lot of suspicious content on the Deep Web, which includes websites that deliberately hide below the surface since they are selling counterfeit or grey-market goods. Additionally, there are phishing sites that collect user credentials and sites disseminating malware that deliberately try to obfuscate their existence. The Deep Web includes peer-to-peer sites where piracy takes place and marketplaces for counterfeits and unauthorised goods. Further, fraudulent social media posts use brand impersonation to trap unwary consumers into disclosing personal information. Responsible marketplaces and social media sites try to keep their sites clean and safe, but the fraudsters are always trying to find ways to insert themselves.\n\nDefeating fraudsters in the digital world requires disrupting both their means of distribution and their ability to promote themselves. They promote themselves to consumers by directing people to the Deep Web via social media, websites, mobile apps, page searches, page search ads and phishing or spam emails.\n\nWhat is a darknet?\n\nFigure 1: Downloading Tor\n\nClick here to view image.\n\nA darknet is, by definition, part of the Deep Web. Within a darknet, both visitors and publishers are entirely anonymous. Anonymity is achieved by using tools such as Tor, I2P and Tails.\n\nTor is free software which enables anonymous communication. It was originally developed in the mid-1990s by the US Naval Research Laboratory and today 2.5 million people access Tor on a daily basis. It is used by privacy advocates who do not want their online actions tracked. People searching for dangerous and sensitive information take advantage of Tor’s anonymity. They include journalists, law enforcement agencies and criminals.\n\nDownloading Tor takes just a couple of minutes on www.torproject.org (see Figure 1).\n\nAccessing underground marketplaces\n\nFigure 2: A typical Tor marketplace\n\nClick here to view image.\n\nTor enables anonymous search for specific goods, both legitimate and illegitimate. Websites such as deepdotweb.com provide links to some of the more popular marketplaces.\n\nThe most popular items sold on these underground marketplaces are drugs – both illicit drugs (eg, heroin, methamphetamines and cocaine) and prescription pharmaceuticals. Personal account and financial information is traded. Pirated content is distributed. Counterfeit goods are sold openly, often in massive quantities. Think of something illegal and it is most likely available on darknet marketplaces. The threats to intellectual property are wide and varied.\n\nSome underground marketplaces are very sophisticated and have many of the features found in well-known marketplaces on the Surface Web. They provide seller ratings, seller profiles, order history and online discussion groups to share information about the products (see Figure 2).\n\nA typical Tor marketplace includes thumbnails of counterfeit or grey-market goods, as well as the exchange rate for Bitcoin or Dash – the popular cryptocurrencies used for transactions. Marketplaces exist that are dedicated to (among other items) pirated software, child pornography, luxury goods, pharmaceuticals and counterfeits.\n\nChat forums and darknet discussion\n\nA darknet typically includes a range of channels where criminals and hacktivists exchange tips. Depending on their industry, brand owners should consider taking proactive steps to monitor these discussions in order to determine the threats that they pose. This requires the creation of cover stories and fake personas, so partnering with an experienced professional organisation is strongly advised.\n\nPerhaps one of the more troubling aspects of darknets is the sale of personal information, including bank account credentials, credit card information and other kinds of personal financial information that hackers and phishers have acquired.\n\nWhat role does Bitcoin play and how does it work?\n\nMany darknet sites use Bitcoin or Dash as private digital currencies to facilitate their transactions. A number of different cryptocurrencies are in circulation, but Bitcoin is the one that seems to be most popular with these sites.\n\nBitcoin is truly fascinating in the way that it works. It is an anonymous currency that uses peer-to-peer technology and has no central banking authority. This means that users can transact directly without needing an intermediary. It is an instrument of alternative finance which has emerged outside of the traditional financial system.\n\nAs of August 2015, over 14 million bitcoin were in circulation. The value of 1 bitcoin fluctuated between $223 and $309 over the course of 2015.\n\nThere are a number of advantages to consumers using Bitcoin for transactions, and these same features make it more challenging to enforce against brand infringement. Since Bitcoin is not controlled by any central authority, it lives outside the established financial system and is decentralised and anonymous. Transactions are not associated with names, addresses or any identifying information.\n\nThere are obvious benefits for people using this form of payment for illegal underground transactions. With no means to trace purchases through credit card records or fiscal reporting regulations, both buyers and sellers are free of government regulation and oversight. Law enforcement agencies cannot follow a money trail to the source of the activity.\n\nBrand owners cannot ignore the fact that an increasing amount of commerce, both legitimate and otherwise, is being facilitated by the anonymous nature of Bitcoin. A growing list of businesses – from coffee shops to florists – now accept payment in Bitcoin.\n\nSources of IP abuse in the Deep Web\n\nBrands are at risk in the Deep Web. Even though sites are not indexed, they can be reached in a number of ways. Many consumers are not even aware that they have been redirected to a Deep Web site. This can occur in a number of ways, including via:\n\ntyposquatted, un-indexed web pages with names that are close matches to legitimate brand sites;\n\nsearch engine ads for particular keywords that resolve to Deep Web sites;\n\nmobile apps that redirect to un-indexed websites; and\n\nemail messages with links that redirect to Deep Web sites.\n\nHow to combat abuse in the Deep Web\n\nBrands can mitigate abuse in the Deep Web. Even though a website might be attempting to hide its identity and not be found by a search engine, experience shows that methods to uncover and address the abuse exist.\n\nJust like on the Surface Web, a suite of standard tools is available to brand owners to combat abuse, once detected. These include takedown requests to internet service providers, cease-and-desist notices and, if required, the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy.\n\nIdentifying IP abuse in a darknet\n\nA darknet is a completely different environment in which to identify and address IP abuse. For most companies, the risks and means of mitigating them are still evolving.\n\nCompanies first need to understand their level of risk. Certain types of company are at greater risk than others. For example, financial institutions are obviously at risk. Fraudsters leverage a number of social engineering scams to steal log-in credentials and credit card information from financial customers. They then sell stolen credentials and credit card information via social media, chat forums and underground marketplaces. Using anonymiser technology to access a darknet, fraudsters provide buyers with a step-by-step guide to purchase stolen credentials and credit card information with ease. Fraudsters also sell cloned credit cards at a discounted price, guaranteeing ‘promised funds’. In one example gathered from a darknet, a fraudster was selling 50 stolen credit cards for $400 and 500 cards for $5,000.\n\nCompanies that are faced with counterfeit distribution of their products should determine whether a darknet is being used as a distribution channel for their goods. Massive quantities can be bought and sold without the brand owner’s knowledge, if it does not investigate darknets.\n\nCompanies should determine whether they need some sort of regular monitoring of darknets. Options include periodically monitoring darknets or taking a snapshot to evaluate the scale of the problem. Third-party experts can assist with this task.\n\nNot every company needs to implement a programme at this point. It varies by vertical, acceptable level of risk and willingness to invest.\n\nHow to combat IP abuse in a darknet\n\nDue to anonymity, online enforcement on darknets is difficult.\n\nHowever, brand owners should not ignore darknets. While anonymity makes enforcement difficult, darknets are open to investigation. A landscape overview will help brand owners to understand the scale and scope of threats.\n\nTypically, these marketplaces require a customer to register and provide standard credential information. Some will not allow a party to join without an invitation – although this can be surprisingly easy to secure.\n\nDepending on the issues faced, a brand owner might consider working with experts who can carry out test buys in order to understand what is being sold and whether such goods are counterfeit, grey market or even stolen.\n\nThese are the early days of identifying and mitigating IP abuse on darknets and the situation is fluid and evolving. Although it has been occurring for a long time, it is only now starting to gather attention from the mainstream media. Now is a good time for businesses to examine this area and find out what is going on out there.\n\nSummary\n\nBoth the Deep Web and darknets pose a clear and present danger for brand owners. It is important to understand the difference between these evolving areas and act accordingly.\n\nBrand owners need to be aware of threats to their intellectual property in all areas of the Internet, both visible and hidden, and identify the perpetrators where possible in order to enforce IP rights effectively.\n\nEngaging with experienced advisers should allow brand owners to understand the internet landscape in full – not just the 4% that one can find via a standard search engine.\n\nAkino Chikada\n\nThis article first appeared in World Trademark Review. For further information please visit www.worldtrademarkreview.com.', 'Andrew ""Drew"" Hinkes is Counsel at Berger Singerman LLP, a business law firm in Florida. Hinkes represents companies and entrepreneurs in state and federal commercial litigation matters, representation of court-appointed fiduciaries, and electronic discovery issues.\n\nDrew is also frequently published and cited for his work on virtual currencies, smart contracts, distributed ledger-based technologies, computer data security and data breaches and technology regulation.\n\nMost startups and entrepreneurs in the bitcoin or blockchain space have confronted the reality that governments take money crimes seriously.\n\nDealing with regulators is critical to post-implementation success and survival. But what entrepreneurs may not yet understand is that their new ventures exist interdependently with legacy legal systems.\n\nWhat happens when bitcoin and blockchain startups stop worrying about regulatory compliance and start intersecting with these existing ""real-life"" systems? Said differently, how will the constructs and systems created to handle civil litigation adapt to bitcoin and the blockchain?\n\n""Civil litigation"" generally includes all non-criminal legal dispute resolution matters. Although many controversies are determined outside of courts (through arbitration, as is common in credit card disputes), the majority of non-criminal disputes in the US are resolved by civil litigation.\n\nThe US legal system provides the mechanism for dispute resolution through the laws and the court system. US law honors both legislatively enacted law and judge-made precedent, ie prior opinions of courts.\n\nAlthough most who track the industry are aware of regulatory laws affecting bitcoin and blockchain platforms, there are few legal opinions issued by judges related to bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nA review on Westlaw, a well-known legal research provider, reveals only 34 published judicial opinions nationwide mention bitcoin. Of those opinions, six were criminal and four related to regulatory enforcement actions.\n\nOnly 12 relate to non-criminal matters, and most of those opinions are related to claims against mining companies for failing to deliver mining equipment, attempts to recover bitcoins lost in Mt Gox or they relate to the use of bitcoin to barter for or purchase other goods and services.\n\nThese opinions, so far, do not provide precedent sufficient to instruct potentially confused judges who may confront bitcoin for the first time.\n\nBankruptcy\n\nTake the bankrupt individual debtor who owns bitcoins. Or, consider the blockchain startup owner who never makes it to market.\n\nAlthough these debtors may have fallen on hard times, the US Bankruptcy Code allows for debtors to disclose their assets and obtain a ""fresh start,"" with the accompanying discharge of their debts.\n\nBut, what happens if the bankrupt party fails to disclose his bitcoin holdings? What if the examining Trustee never asks about bitcoin?\n\nEven if the Trustee is unaware of bitcoin and fails to inquire about the debtor’s virtual currency assets, and even if there is no clear line item for virtual currency assets on the current form of bankruptcy schedules (virtual currency assets are property, according to the IRS), failure to disclose assets may result in the debtor losing his or her ability to obtain a discharge. As a result, that debtor could remain saddled with his or her debts.\n\nOr, consider the blockchain startup that never makes it to market. That debtor entity is equally required to disclose its virtual currency assets.\n\nCourts, confused by or unfamiliar with bitcoin and virtual currencies, may view them with suspicion. A court may consider a transfer made in bitcoin to be inherently fraudulent.\n\nCourts already use certain circumstantial indicators, known as ""badges of fraud"" by the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA), when attempting to determine whether certain transfers of value are fraudulent. Among the badges considered, the court may look at a bitcoin transaction and determine that the transfer was (a) concealed, or that that the transfer was (b) made to conceal or remove assets, both of which are identified badges of fraud under the UFTA.\n\nAlthough it is a fact-dependent inquiry, Courts will be forced to wrestle with and determine their policy positions regarding the intrinsic pseudo-anonymity of bitcoin with potentially uneven initial results.\n\nOne court may determine that bitcoin transfers are inherently concealed, while another court may determine that the use of bitcoin by itself is not intentional concealment.\n\nAlthough this remains an unanswered question, the more reasoned conclusion is that transfers of value using bitcoin or a virtual currency, in the absence of other factors, should not be considered to be evidence of concealment or an intent to remove assets.\n\nDivorce\n\nAnother instance involves divorcing spouses.\n\nThe husband, only understanding that his wife bought a large amount of computer equipment to mine bitcoin, files a petition seeking a divorce and wants to understand (and divide) his wife’s mining and bitcoin assets.\n\nAt her deposition, the wife says she never obtained any bitcoin over her years of mining.\n\nHow can the husband find out how much bitcoin she acquired? How does the husband’s lawyer actually discover evidence of her bitcoin holdings, or evidence of her transactions?\n\nThe husband’s lawyer can use the court’s power to obtain information (referred to in civil litigation as ""discovery"") that will allow him to determine if there are any virtual currency assets available. That lawyer may attempt to analyze the physical mining equipment, if it is still available, which will require a Court order and likely an expert.\n\nThe lawyer may serve written discovery to attempt to identify transactions on the blockchain, and may require an expert to analyze the transfers. He or she will likely depose the wife and rely upon her oath that she will testify truthfully, and inquire about her mining and bitcoin use.\n\nHowever, without undertaking proper discovery to identify transaction IDs or public keys, the discovery process is entirely contingent on the wife’s desire and ability to testify truthfully and fully about her bitcoin dealings.\n\nCan the husband attach to (ie obtain possession of) bitcoin held by his wife?\n\nAs a practical matter, upon a proper evidentiary showing, he is probably authorized to do so, but must be able to evidence where the wallet resides so the court is able to exercise jurisdiction over that wallet.\n\nIt is suggested that the wallet will likely be determined to reside in the location of the private key (which provides control over the assets held in the wallet), or in the case of a multi-sig wallet, private keys.\n\nEducation needed\n\nAlthough the bitcoin and blockchain community has done an admirable job educating its regulators, the judiciary handles most routine business disputes, and to date, has yet to create a body of precedent, or a ""common law"" of bitcoin.\n\nAs bitcoin and blockchain technology looks beyond regulation, bitcoin users and blockchain innovators will inevitably find themselves in business lawsuits, divorces and bankruptcies and must be prepared to educate the judiciary about this new paradigm.\n\nAndrew Hinkes will discuss these issues 4th February, 2016, at: Bitcoin, Virtual Currencies and the Law, in Rockville, Maryland.\n\nLegal book image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

This is the way in which social networking companies can earn money thanks to advertising and statistics.\n\nFor example, Facebook is a centralized social network and they are able to use users’ data to know their habits and sell targeted advertising.\n\nThere are some exceptions: YouTube allows video producers to earn money by sharing a part of the payments, but there are a lot of fees to pay.\n\nSo, what’s the solution?\n\nWe cannot talk about a specific definition of a decentralized social network, as they are still in development.\n\nHowever, the basic idea behind decentralized social networks is twofold.\n\nThere is an economic reason: if users can create wealth, they could be paying for the value they produce.\n\nAnother reason is that users can contribute to the network, editing the open source software behind the social network itself.\n\nDATT\n\nCreated by Ryan X Charles, who previously worked at BitPay and Reddit, Datt (short for Decentralize All the Things) is a still-in-development social network that utilizes the blockchain.\n\n“The current timeline is to launch something in about 6 months. However, I have begun the process of recruiting cofounders. It is possible we will be able to finish sooner if I can find the right people.”, said Ryan X Charles.\n\n“Datt is a social network where people can read content and pay the creators. Our goal is to empower users to find the best content, to properly own their content, and to get paid for the value they produce”, says the “about us” page on Datt’s website.\n\nBut, “The copyright problem is not unique to Datt. Every social media app has this problem. Reddit has a problem where content gets reposted. Users on Facebook sometimes copy a video from Youtube and reshare it without giving any credit to the original content creators. Datt will solve this problem by leveraging a human-powered flagging system for copyrighted content. We will also eventually include data analysis for programmatically determining what content is copyrighted by someone else. While it is not possible to permanently delete content from Datt, it is possible to inform users about who the true author or owner of a piece of content is”, he continued.\n\nDECENT\n\nI recently had the pleasure to speak with the co-founder of Decent, Matej Michalko. Here is what he had to say about his social network:\n\n“DECENT is a decentralized blockchain based peer to peer content distribution network. It implements its own token of payment - DCT, similar to the ETH gas in Ethereum. The main advantage of DECENT over traditional platforms is that DECENT is anonymous; all the players are identified exclusively by their ID and protected by advanced cryptography. However, the users also have the option to be associated with given content. Focused on freedom of speech and expression, the platform provides unlimited access to information for everyone in the world. DECENT provides open-source software that enables users to share unlimited virtual content; the company’s main goal is to give a chance to individuals whose voice is normally controlled. DECENT combines a micropayment framework with solid encryption, giving a whole new level of privacy to its users—the DECENT platform only allows for authorized users to access the content. The platform operates via a P2P network, and DECENT’s platform is not centrally hosted, so the data cannot be manipulated and they can never be blocked. Authors can set the price for the content. Only users who paid the price set by the author can access the content. On the other hand, the payment will be processed only if the user verifiably received the content. The Author pays the Publisher for acting as a storage and content distribution network. The payment will be released over time to motivate the publisher to keep the content as long as required. The payment for network storage is also an effective anti-spam mechanism. Consumers can rate the content. These ratings can be used for various purposes, e.g. assuming content quality, author’s reputation or by recommendation engines. 100% of the payment for the content goes to the author. There are no network or processing fees. The Author and Consumer can remain fully anonymous if they want to”.\n\nSYNEREO\n\nSynereo’s social network has its own currency token, AMP, and offers users the ability to completely control the information they share.\n\nCoinTelegraph previously interviewed Synereo co-founder, Anderson McCutcheon, who explained to us the main functions of this project and its longer term strategy to obtain dominance over big players such as Facebook.\n\n“For mainstream adoption, our long term goal is to provide a superior user experience.

Will citizens turn to superior currencies as a safe haven for their wealth? Will Bitcoin make a sweep into the Nigerian market?\n\nThe Nigerian economy has been compared to that of Venezuela as both nations have, for the past couple of decades, generated a major part of their revenue from oil exports.\n\nWhile the oil boom was in full swing, both Venezuela and Nigeria failed to invest in their futures by developing their oil infrastructure and diversifying their respective economies. With global oil prices collapsing, the nation of Nigeria finds itself in trouble as it struggles to find an alternative source of revenue to fund its national budget. In an attempt to address this issue, Nigerians have seen an influx of internal policies, indirectly taxing citizens of the country through the introduction of a number of bank charges and other institutional charges for services within the country. However, these small fees barely make a dent in, let alone eliminate, the huge deficit of about $11Billion reflected in Nigeria’s 2016 National Budget.\n\nOpinions have emerged on what the response of the Nigerian public will be as several indicators point towards further depreciation of the national currency.\n\nA major problem has been created\n\nAlthough the Nigerian President has insisted that he would not move to officially devalue the naira, something he reaffirmed when he met with Nigerians living in Kenya during his last visit, his statement has been criticised in some circles. Prominent among his critics is Pat Utomi, a renowned Nigerian professor of political economy and a management expert. He is also a Fellow of the Institute of Management Consultants of Nigeria. Prof. Utomi said that the President had created a major problem for the Nigerian economy by making that statement. In his words,\n\n“Somebody like him should not be talking about such things, keep quiet let people who talk about them, whatever your sentiments are talk about them, otherwise you create a problem [sic].”\n\n- Pat Utomi, Nigerian professor of political economy and a management expert.\n\nHe concluded by saying that the country did not take advantage of the windfall by diversifying its economy when oil prices were high, despite knowing how volatile the price of oil can be.\n\nIs there a patriotic will?\n\nEkene Isiuwe, an ex-banker with Investment One Financial Services Limited holds a similar opinion to that of Prof. Utomi. According to Ekene:\n\n“Several governments have spoken extensively on other income heads that could supplement the income loss from falling prices in crude oil, but implementation has been lacking.”\n\nEkene says that for the naira to survive, the citizens of Nigeria must take up the patriotic responsibility of avoiding the rush of trying to secure their personal wealth, by storing them in superior currencies, so that the demand for the naira can still be reasonably sustainable. However, he does concede that such patriotism might just be too much to ask from a people whose wealth matters so much to them.\n\nThe naira is dead\n\nAmang Saliyuk, an SEO Consultant and blogger, was particularly blunt about the matter, and very straightforward in his assertion, saying:\n\n“When Mao Tse-tung took over in China the first thing he did was to force everyone to the farms, he made sure the country had enough before they even talked about exports he ensured that internal capacity was developed. When they fully developed the capacity to feed themselves and were also able to produce their daily needs without imports they started exporting. Farming for now is our only way out. Create an almost closed economy, make sure our fiscal and monetary policies are in tandem. The truth is that the naira is dead and our government knows it. The President is just scared of the backlash that is why the naira hasn't been devalued yet.”\n\nThe boat has sailed already\n\nThere is usually a prevailing trend which occurs within most developing nations at the sight of a falling local currency. Citizens and institutions very often tend to store their wealth in superior currencies and in locations far from their immediate economic environment. This phenomenon has already began to unfold within the Nigerian system.\n\nBabatunde Ajayi, Team Lead of Corporate Finance at Investment One Financial Services Limited, when asked about this, responded by saying;\n\n“Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but most rich folks and financial institutions are already holding their cash in ‘hard currencies’.”\n\nSome facts are very clear about the state of the Nigerian economy;\n\nThe future does not look very good for the Nigerian local currency.\n\nRescuing the naira will take time and disciplined commitment.\n\nNigerians are already seeking safe havens to preserve their wealth and protect its value.\n\nThe big question is; Will Bitcoin seize the opportunity to make its way into the most populous African nation?\n\nOnly time will tell.""]"
02/05/2016,"['Although scalability (the block size limit) has been the main topic of conversation in the Bitcoin community over the past year, this controversy has also brought up another important subject for the peer-to-peer digital cash system: governance. Bitcoin Core Contributor Peter Todd is no fan of Bitcoin XT, but he does like the fact that Mike Hearn’s alternative implementation of the Bitcoin protocol brought the topic of governance to a wider audience.\n\nSo how does Bitcoin governance work? Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce was recently asked this question by Jason Calacanis on This Week in Startups, and he described the checks and balances that exist between different participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nA Developer Has to Write the Code\n\nPierce described Bitcoin governance in layers, noting that a developer must first write code that becomes an option for users of the system:\n\n“The system actually has multiple layers. One, a developer has to write the code and put it forward. It really goes through a peer-review type of process where it gets vetted because it’s a very public process. It’s an open-source project; that’s what it is.”\n\nSome are worried about the perceived centralization currently found in the Bitcoin development process, but in reality, developers have no power over what code Bitcoin users decide to run on their computers. Although Bitcoin Core is currently the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, the five developers with commit access to that particular software client do not have any sort of tyrannical power over the system.\n\nThe Consensus of Miners\n\nOnce a developer has written some code, it is then up to miners to decide whether they should switch to that new software or stick with the code they’re currently running. Miners even have the ability to not upgrade their software if they do not agree with a change made by the development team behind the current reference implementation of the protocol.\n\nDuring his interview, Pierce noted much more than 51 percent of miners need to agree on any proposed changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules:\n\n“The people that are running the infrastructure have to come to an agreement. The miners have to say yes, and then they need to run it, process a certain number of blocks, and you actually need more than 51 percent. You really need – call it 90 percent. You need [social] consensus of those miners.”\n\nThe level of social consensus among miners needed to implement a change that would cause a hard fork differs depending on whom you talk to. Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen would say 75 percent of miners is enough for a hard fork, while the developers behind Bitcoin Core would like to see “near-universal agreement” before implementing such a change. The Chinese Bitcoin community has also decided it will only accept a hard fork to a 2-megabyte block size limit if 90 percent of the network hashrate agrees to it. Having said that, it’s unclear whether they would be willing to switch to Bitcoin Classic in order to make that change.\n\nUsers Choose Which Coin Has Value\n\nThe last level of Bitcoin governance is the user base. After all, bitcoin miners are only going to mine on a blockchain that actually has value. Pierce explained the role of Bitcoin holders and Bitcoin companies in Bitcoin governance:\n\n“The miners are also influenced by the other parties, which would be the companies: the Bitcoin exchanges, the wallets, [and] the payment process. What happens is you go through this process of a hard fork where you get two versions of the software running, which means now everyone’s coins have been replicated into two wallets. Now, whichever one the payment processors accept as real – they start to have an influence.”\n\nThis Week in Startups host Calacanis noted the similarities between the participants in the Bitcoin network and the three branches of government in the United States:\n\n“It’s almost like the government where you have the executive branch, the legislative branch [and the judicial branch].”\n\nThe recent launches of Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic have been the first serious tests of this governance model. Bitcoin Core has been able to avoid a hard fork for the time being by implementing Segregated Witness via a soft fork , but there is near-universal consensus on the need for an eventual hard fork to a larger block size limit in Bitcoin.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

You can follow @kyletorpey on Twitter.\n\nPhoto Hans Splinter / Flickr(CC)', 'Go anywhere near the upper echelons of a bank or finance firm right now and there\'s one buzzword you\'ll hear over and over again — blockchain.\n\nFirst invented to underpin bitcoin, blockchain technology uses decentralized record keeping and the scrutiny of the ""crowd"" to allow people to trade bitcoin on a public network without working through a trusted middle man like a bank or clearing house. Complex cryptography keeps the records from being tampered with once they\'re signed off on.\n\nThe world of finance has worked itself up into a frenzy over how much money this technology could save if adapted to mainstream banking. Banks could trade assets directly with each other instead of waiting for up to two days for a third party to settle the transaction.\n\nBut, says itBit CEO Chad Cascarilla, there\'s more to blockchain than just budgetary hype. Not only does the technology have the potential to cut costs, it could also solve one of the biggest problems the financial system faced during the 2008 crash.\n\n""One of the big failings that [the crash] exposed was in the books and records system — who owns what when,"" says Cascarilla.\n\nPart of the reason credit dried up in the crash was because banks and other financial institutions struggled to say exactly who owned what and as a result it was hard to judge their exact credit-worthiness. Without knowing that, people were reluctant to lend.\n\nCascarilla says: ""In the financial system you don’t actually know because it’s all moving around and there’s many days of settlement risk and it’s very hard to track the actual beneficial ownership of an asset — a stock, a bond, whatever.""\n\n""You can’t tell where the risk lies — that’s really an accounting problem, a databasing problem. We still have the same level of access depth now, nothing’s changed since then. Now the government has just said we can’t allow anyone to fail.""\n\nHe adds: ""That’s what we saw blockchain potentially solving, because we had come from that area and that’s what led us to create itBit.""\n\nBlockchain digitally records who owns what and can be inspected by everyone who has access to it — both are crucial in allowing bitcoin to function as a digital currency.\n\nIf the technology were adapted to, say, securities or gold, a bank could simply query the blockchain to make sure a trading partner owns what it says it does.\n\nTransactions over the blockchain are also much faster than working through existing systems, so counterparty risk — the risk that the person you\'re trading with goes bust before you complete a deal — is reduced too. That\'s another bonus for financial stability.\n\nNew York-based itBit, founded in 2012, runs a bitcoin exchange but has also developed Bankchain, an off-the-shelf blockchain solution for banks and other financial institutions that can be adapted for everything from gold trading to clearing securities.\n\nCascarilla is currently in conversation with around a dozen banks and financial firms, with several partnerships and proof of concepts under way. ""We’ve got to the point where the rubber hits the road,"" Cascarilla says. He declined to name the partners itBit is working.\n\nCheck back on Sunday to read a full interview with itBit\'s Chad Cascarilla on Business Insider.', ""About The Author\n\nDaniel is a bitcoin investor and journalist for numerous news outlets in the financial sector. When he's not writing, trading, or interviewing people, you can find him swimming, reading or taking one of his hobbies to the next level."", 'An advisor to Russian president Vladimir Putin has reportedly spoken out about bitcoin, going as far to suggest that taking payments in the digital currency is a criminal act.\n\nRecently appointed Internet advisor German Klimenko told Russian-language online news service Lenta.ru that the acceptance of bitcoin payments constitutes a crime.\n\nAccording to a translation by Russian bitcoin news site ForkLog, Klimenko told Lenta.ru:\n\n""Bitcoin is not the first one, there are other settlement means. Accepting bitcoin as a payment for anything is unacceptable because it is a crime.""\n\nKlimenko went on to suggest that other countries will move to ban digital currencies should broader adoption take place.\n\n""Because no state in the world, while watching it in homeopathic doses with pleasure, but when it becomes critical, everyone will certainly ban it,"" he told the publication.\n\nThe comments come as Russia is moving ahead with plans to prohibit the use of so-called money surrogates, a class of non-government issued monies that include bitcoin. However, questions remain as to what form the ban would take if instituted, and further, how it would actually be enforced.\n\nKlimenko has notably spoken out about regulating the Internet in the past.\n\nAs reported by Russian-language online news source Meduza, based in Latvia, the presidential advisor believes that the Internet needs more regulation because ""the Internet is flooded with money, and criminals and terrorists"".\n\n""Of course, all this needs to be regulated,"" he said.\n\nImage via Lenta.ru\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While Satoshi Nakamoto might have arbitrarily designed a 1MB block size into the Bitcoin protocol with little explanation, many industry people forget that, just because that amount was arbitrary, does not mean the protocol must scale now or ever. The people who feel this way – in what essentially represents a conservative approach to the debate – have been shunned completely in the discussion known as the Bitcoin block size debate. Not scaling is not an option.\n\nThis is a great error as it obfuscates the real debate at hand. The reality is many Bitcoiners believe a conservative approach, even if that means no block size increase, is not preposterous. I am not saying it must be the answer. I am saying it is one possible answer for the multiple choice question regarding block size.\n\nWhat happens if the block size is not increased? Fees increase. Perhaps Bitcoiners have a huge aversion to fees because many of the industry’s startups have not done well. Even some of the biggest in the space, as if trying to make stone bleed, are burning cash in their early years. Jokes aside, I have heard from more than one individual who transacts in Bitcoin daily that, for those transactions in which a fee is included, sometimes as tiny as twenty cents, confirmation is no waiting game.\n\nBitcoiners on the Internet complain about having to wait for a transaction for which they paid too small a fee (or no fee at all). But, let’s look at the big picture.\n\nReceiving and sending money on PayPal can cost up to 3% of the total transaction, as high as credit card fees. It takes three to five days to process. A wire transfer domestically in the US costs between $15 and $50 (sometimes with both the sender and the receiver being charged some amount). International wire transfer fees cost even more. Major Bitcoin businesses are transacting high amounts of Bitcoin, while paying fees significantly less than the above-listed money transfer options, without having to wait.\n\nSo, what does this all mean?\n\nThere is no rush to come up with a solution for the Bitcoin block size debate. Many people have made this clear, both to me in private and on public forums, including Gavin Andresen, who wrote in response to Mike Hearn’s Medium post about leaving Bitcoin the following:\n\nAnd Bitcoin will survive without a short-term solution, but adoption and growth might be set back a year or two.\n\nTheymos, the much-aligned administrator of Reddit Bitcoin subforum and BitcoinTalk, came out years ago on his thoughts regarding the block size limit. He also described his view of the debate in mid-2015:\n\nSatoshi never used IRC, and he rarely explained his motivations for anything. In this case, he kept the change secret and told people who discovered it to keep it quiet until it was over with so that controversy or attackers wouldn’t cause havok with the ongoing rule change… ….I think that he was just trying to solve an obvious denial-of-service attack vector. He wasn’t thinking about the future of the network very much except to acknowledge that the limit could be raised if necessary. The network clearly couldn’t support larger blocks at that time, and nowadays we know that the software wasn’t even capable of handling 1 MB blocks properly. Satoshi once told me, “I think most P2P networks, and websites for that matter, are vulnerable to an endless number of DoS attacks. The best we can realistically do is limit the worst cases.” I think he viewed the 1 MB limit as just blocking yet another serious DoS attack…. …Satoshi is gone now, so it’ll be “the developers” who set the larger limit. But it has been determined by the majority of the Bitcoin Core developers (and the majority of Bitcoin experts in general) that the network cannot actually safely handle significantly larger blocks, so it won’t be done right now. And the economy has the final say, of course, not the developers.\n\nIt’s painful how much factionalization has resulted in the Bitcoin space. In fact, the factionalization of the Bitcoin community represents a major problem for the digital currency’s future, and has already made the likelihood of adoption by people of competitors to Bitcoin higher.\n\nThat’s why fees in the now are not such a bad thing. It’s better than the further splintering of the Bitcoin industry, which no doubt will turn investors, entrepreneurs and old fashioned Bitcoiners in the direction of alternative digital currency under the universal investing tip of diversification.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should the be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

A pair of attorneys at the global Pillsbury law firm claim that screening rules still exist when trading with Iran, which means complications for anyone in the U.S. and European Union (EU) doing bitcoin transactions with parties in Iran, according to City A.M., a London, U.K. newspaper.\n\nAttorneys Steven Farmer and Matthew Oresman claim some EU and U.S. financial sanctions remain in place against certain Iranian individuals and businesses. (The lawyers are both sanctions experts and Farmer is also a bitcoin expert.) In such cases, it is necessary to screen parties in Iran when doing transactions with them. The same holds true for doing transactions with other nations under sanctions such as Russia and Syria.\n\nBitcoin Complicates Due Diligence\n\nIf an entity is on an asset freeze list, there is a prohibition on dealing with “economic resources” or funds controlled by that entity.\n\nThe lawyers said bitcoin complicates due diligence in such situations. “The bitcoin system does not lend itself to traditional screening processes.”\n\nThey characterized the problem as a regulatory nightmare.\n\nConducting business with bitcoin belonging to an entity on an asset freeze list breaches sanction laws in lieu of an appropriate license.\n\nBuyers and sellers of bitcoin interact with encrypted identities; it is not necessary to transfer personal information when conducting a bitcoin transaction. As a result, it is hard to perform checks on counterparties when trading in bitcoin.\n\nDue diligence is needed when doing business with a sanctioned entity to avoid big fines and possible prison terms.\n\nAlso read: Will latest bans on cash and controls grow bitcoin?\n\nHow To Comply With Sanctions\n\nThe lawyers advise those using bitcoin to know how to protect themselves against risks posed by a decentralized system like bitcoin. One option is to ask counterparties to prove they own the bitcoin ID they use on the network and to provide a track record for that ID. They should also avoid dealing with counterparties that use “stealth addresses” that can hide the identity of bitcoin payer or payee.\n\nRecent initiatives to analyze bitcoin transaction traces indicate that it could become easier to identify parties to bitcoin transactions. Directories of transactions could lessen complications for legal and compliance teams when considering the legality of bitcoin trades.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin users dealing with sanctioned entities must implement robust processes to verify a counterparty’s identity and to check in advance before trading.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'BITCOIN\n\nBringing bitcoin exchanges’ anonymous trading practices to the public could be the key to tracking down terror groups’ funding, according to the European Union executive arm.\n\nLast month, a senior official of the European Commission (EC) told the European Parliament that the commission doesn’t see the need to regulate digital currencies just yet because they are more focused on understanding “better what is happening.”\n\nNow weeks later, the commission came out with an action plan that details several changes to its Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD). The amendments, according to the commission, will help strengthen the government’s fight against terrorism financing.\n\nThe plan doesn’t actually have any piece of evidence to prove virtual currencies are being used to finance terrorism, but EC feels the need to come up with a regulation as part of its ongoing effort to stop terror attacks. Better to be safe than sorry, right?\n\nUnder the commission’s plan, digital currency exchanges will be required to report who used their services and when they were used.\n\n“There is a risk that virtual currency transfers may be used by terrorist organizations to conceal transfers, as transactions with virtual currencies are recorded, but there is no reporting mechanism equivalent to that found in the mainstream banking system to identify suspicious activity,” the EU executive arm said.\n\nEU, however, doesn’t single out digital currency: the action plan also calls for a re-think of how authorities will be able to identify users of pre-loaded credit cards with affecting the mass market.\n\nThe current AMLD doesn’t cover digital currencies, but if and when cryptocurrencies are included in the new AMLD directives, then bitcoin exchanges will have to bid farewell to anonymous transactions, which is arguably its bestselling feature.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Oliver Salles, senior financial services official of the commission, said they are “not in a hurry” to regulate financial products connected to digital currencies.\n\nThere are about 600 types of digital currencies being used around the world today, and Bitcoin accounts for about 90 percent of the $7 billion sector, according to Reuters.\n\nHowever, bitcoin has gotten a bad rap in 2013 after authorities in the United States uncovered the notorious “deep web” Silk Road, which is known for allowing its users to transact a wide range of illegal practices, including hiring hitmen and buying and selling drugs, using virtual currency.\n\nLast year’s attack in Paris hasn’t helped either, after hackers claimed terrorists used bitcoin to fund the operation. The event only sparked renewed debates on the potential of digital currencies to be used to finance terrorism and money laundering.\n\nComments', 'An Alaskan conservative commentator and self-styled judge has called for the world to embrace blockchain technology.\n\nAnna von Reitz, who frequently writes about social justice and the US, argues that the problems in the country are the result of a century of rule ""by the criminals who have hijacked our government, wealth, and heritage"".\n\nIn her essays, von Reitz singles out the Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund and other organizations as emblematic of these issues. Late last year she went as far as calling for the arrest of President Barack Obama and the US Congress, gaining Internet infamy in the process.\n\nHowever, in a 22nd January letter addressed to Pope Francis, von Reitz wrote that a distributed financial network could help solve those problems. While she she doesn’t name bitcoin directly, she arguably alludes to the digital currency by way of ""a common worldwide currency"".\n\nVon Reitz explained:\n\n""Instead of taking one or two or three commodities and using them as standards of value – which always leads to scarcity and hoarding and manipulation of those commodities – why not flip this paradigm on its head, and use all the value of all labor and all natural resources to back a common worldwide currency delivered by blockchain technology, available to everyone, everywhere?""\n\nA decentralized currency, she argued, would make it easier to deliver this kind of service because it removes the influence of greedy third parties.\n\n""Whatever service delivery problems there have been or which still are, can be overcome now via a truthful and honest worldwide currency and credit system using blockchain technology,"" she wrote, adding:\n\n""Please admit the Truth and end this blasphemy, this false claim of scarcity, once and for all. Admit that there are only two things of value on the Earth so far as trade among men is concerned----labor and natural resources.""\n\nLater in the piece, von Reitz walks through how this theoretical system might operate, with allocations of resources based on national population. Yet each member of those societies would be connected via blockchain and receive their income through it.\n\nShe wrote:\n\n”There is no reason that every man, woman, and child on this planet could not be given a basic living stipend and an investment account. This could be delivered using two separate pre-paid credit accounts with transactions via blockchain.\n\nShe expanded on the idea in another letter, on the subject of China.\n\n""We can trade credit digits on ledgers and use blockchain transactions to track them – and allow each of us value based on our overall ability to work and contribute, plus our share of the world\'s natural resources,” she wrote.\n\n""No more fraudulent debt currencies. No more stealing from the future. No more phony controls and commodity manipulations.""\n\nReitz did not respond to inquiries regarding the letters, including whether they had actually been sent to Vatican City in Rome, the global seat of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nVon Reitz concludes her 22nd January letter with a call to action for Pope Francis and the Roman Catholic Church to reject the existing financial system and ""join with the people in putting an end to corporate greed and lack of accountability"".\n\n""The corporations have caused these problems. The corporations – not the people – need to pay for correcting them and cleaning them up,"" she wrote.\n\nImage credit: neneo / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

02/06/2016,"['When it comes to online payment standards, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is finding it difficult to engage the bitcoin community.\n\n""It\'s proven easier to get a bank to participate in payments standards than a bitcoin community company,"" says Manu Sporny, chairman of the W3C Web Payments community group and founder and CEO of web platform startup Digital Bazaar.\n\nBecause it\'s still early days for the bitcoin industry, he says, these companies aren’t looking to interoperate, but instead want to dominate the web payments market.\n\nFounded by Web creator Tim Berners-Lee, the W3C is the preeminent organization for developing international standards for the web. Its work in online payments started about five years ago with a simple goal – sending a payment should be as easy as sending an email in the digital world, a value proposition familiar to many bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nToward this end, the group has discussed how to ease the process of adding new payment mechanisms to the web, expanding consumer choice. But web payments groups have struggled to get participation from the bitcoin industry.\n\nWhen competing at the standards level, the blockchain community is of the verge of creating the same ""walled gardens that we\'re always criticizing on the Internet,"" says Primavera de Filippi, founder of COALA, a research and development initiative for blockchain technologies that also set up a W3C community group on crypto-ledger solutions.\n\nSaket Sharma, chief information officer at BNY Mellon\'s Treasury Services unit called out similar drawbacks of working without a standard. ""So the underlying technology itself is so fluid that there’s no stack as a standard, right? So unless you have a standard, you will not be able to interoperate, eventually,"" Sharma told CoinDesk this week.\n\nThe decision could also hamper the technology\'s pervasiveness.\n\n""[Bitcoin] is not going to be as big as the Internet if they don’t start coordinating on some core standards,"" Sporny says.\n\nCycle repeating\n\nSporny likens the issue to the web browser battle in the mid-1990s.\n\nDuring that time, Netscape, built by Marc Andreessen – whose venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has invested in Coinbase and 21 Inc among other bitcoin startups – was competing against Microsoft, which owned the majority of web browsing sessions.\n\nAccording to Sporny, Microsoft opposed standardization, which in turn led to significant backlash.\n\nEventually standards were created making it easy and accessible for competing web browsers to start up and advance the technology.\n\n""These things tend to go through cycles: one player takes over the market centralizing it, then there are calls for standards to break that up and decentralize things so people can compete,"" Sporny says.\n\nThe problem with centralizing an Internet system is that it can result in a single point of failure.\n\nFor instance, he says if sidechains are only built off the bitcoin blockchain, and the blockchain then failed for some reason, all the sidechains it was connected to could go down as well.\n\nInstead, he argues a decentralized solution would allow the creation of separate blockchains that can all communicate with each other.\n\nPayment agnostic\n\nWhile recent reports have claimed that the W3C is bullish on bitcoin and blockchain technology, Sporny says, ""Web payment isn’t focused on ledgers and decentralized clearing and assets.""\n\nIan Jacobs, W3C payments activity lead, commented:\n\n""To the extent that there are new payment methods, we’d like to make sure those payment methods are accepted online … and various payment flows are supported. We don’t favor bitcoin any more than we favor credit cards.""\n\nBut there are a number of people within the Web Payments group talking about bitcoin and how the protocol could be useful for solving some web technology problems, Jacobs says.\n\nWhile the W3C would welcome members of the bitcoin community, Jacobs says: ""We have not seen the bitcoin community flock to the W3C to do work.\n\nBecause executives from Ripple and members of Ethereum have joined the Web Payments work to discuss their alternative cryptographic payments protocols, Sporny thinks the rationale is a bit different within the bitcoin industry.\n\nHe believes there\'s a tendency from within the industry to see bitcoin as the standard other blockchains will be built around.\n\n""The bitcoin community seems to have a chip on their shoulder,"" Sporny says. ""The hype around bitcoin is a big part of it. Bitcoin didn’t exist a few years ago and now it’s this big thing with venture capitalists and companies throwing money at bitcoin startups. That tends to embolden people.""\n\nSporny’s sentiment stems from several years of reaching out to industry stakeholders and getting ignored or rejected.\n\nFor instance, he had a conversation with a large, venture capital-funded bitcoin company that seemed interested, but the lead developer became dismissive about standards and how long the process takes, he says.\n\nHowever, it’s just as likely that cost is a prevailing factor.\n\n""Startups rarely collaborate,"" says Erik Anderson, co-chair of the Web Payments interest group and a researcher and developer at Bloomberg. ""Startups are generally being directed by their investors towards developing a single, universal use case their existing technology can be applied to. Startups need to show investors short-term value.""\n\nTo be a member of a W3C working group, startups pay $2,000 for a two-year membership. Annual fees for more established companies range from $8,000 for small organizations and nonprofits to $88,000 for large organizations like Google and Microsoft.\n\nMembers also send an employee to work on the project, and those fees then go back to the members of the group. The W3C puts working group staff on at a 50% full-time employee rate, which Sporny says, amounts to tens of thousands of dollars per year.\n\nControl over standards\n\nStandards work has never been easy. It’s slow because it rides on consensus, and issues frequently become contentious.\n\nBut ultimately the W3C has continued to be an influential player in the Internet standards and technology space. Several thousands of engineers from organizations around the world work in W3C groups, many of whom are the same people that crafted the standards for the open, robust web we see today.\n\nThe Web Payments working group will be meeting in mid-February in San Francisco to go over two proposals for web payment API infrastructure. A month later, the group should have a working document of the API.\n\nDuring the meeting, stakeholders will also be trying to decide on the group’s next priority, ranging from verifiable credentials; regulatory changes in Europe; coupons built on the API layer; Fed faster payments and blockchain initiatives – including Interledger, a protocol created by Ripple but that now is an open, community effort, and bitcoin for peer-to-peer payments via mobile devices.\n\nThe Web Payments group has continued to see momentum; currently it has 175 members made up of some of the biggest names from all areas of the payment chain, including Alibaba Group, Apple Inc, Google and Visa Europe. Plus several large merchants and mobile telcos have joined the group.\n\nBut momentum for the standardization of blockchain or distributed ledger solutions is unlikely to happen soon. Sporny sees banks and legacy payment providers as more interested in investing in companies like R3.\n\nBanks would prefer to own the ledger solution as a value add, he continued, adding:\n\n""A lot of this has to do with control.""\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Uber, part of the so-called sharing economy, has created jobs and helped people arrive at their destination safely.\n\nThe company has grown, attracting the attention of governments worldwide. The issue for Uber circles on the fact that, in order to drive a taxi or become a taxi company, regulations ensure you keep your customers safe. Uber is not governed by similar regulations. This has unfortunately led to many cities throughout the world to try and ban the new technology startup. Yet, it remains.\n\nBitcoin has not had an easy go of it either, with governments the world over investigating the digital currency, and in many cases determining that it abets drugs and other illicit activities.\n\nDespite these issues, both Uber and Bitcoin survive into the present day. Uber, though it has its occasional issues with its drivers and cities, keeps expanding to more cities. Bitcoin, despite governments looking to regulate the currency, has also grown, as well, especially in Asian countries such as China.\n\nAt the end of 2015, for the first time ever, it became possible to ride Uber for Bitcoin. This was made possible with Coinbase’s Shift Card. The Shift Card allows you to spend bitcoins like regular debit or credit. It costs $10 to receive, with fees similar to a regular debit card. Coinbase’s fee schedule can be found by clicking here.\n\nIn order to use Bitcoin for Uber, you’ll need to sign up for an Uber account and a Shift account. To sign up for Uber, you’ll first need a smartphone. If you’d like to start an account on your desktop, simply go to the Uber website. If you’d like to use it on your smartphone, download it from the app store of your choice.\n\nYou’ll then be asked to “Sign In” or Register.” To do so, you’ll be asked to enter your email or username and your password. Then click, “Register.”\n\nThen you will be asked for your name, address, phone number and credit card number. In order to use Bitcoin, the payment card you use matters – more on that below. Once this information is filled out, you can then use Uber. In order to pick your first ride, you choose which Uber service you want, which generally applies to what sort of vehicle will pick you up. Now that you have the Uber app, you’ll need a Shift Card to use Bitcoin for Uber. Here’s how to get a Shift Card.\n\nRead More: Coinbase Launches First US-Based Debit Card\n\nFirst, you’ll need a Coinbase account. Sign up for one on their website. The card is available in twenty-four states and can be spent online and offline at more than 38 million merchants globally. So, Uber is just one of those merchants. To order a Shift card after receiving a Coinbase account, you can order the card by providing your physical address and paying a $10 issuance fee. In the US, there are no added fees to use the card. Charlie Lee, Coinbase Director of Engineering, once told me that the notion that people can now spend bitcoins at non-Bitcoin accepting merchants will likely help Bitcoin growth and adoption.\n\nLooking to arrive somewhere before getting around with Bitcoin through Uber? There are ways to pay for flights, as well, with Bitcoin, such as Cheap Air. However, the Shift Card will let you do that also. That’s right! The infrastructure is in place for you to get around the world on Bitcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Richard MacManus is the founder and former editor of ReadWriteWeb, a popular tech blog that was launched in 2003 and later acquired by SAY Media in 2011. He now publishes a tech newsletter called Augment Intelligence and authored the book ""Health Trackers"".\n\nIn this opinion piece, MacManus talks about the difficulties of running a web-based business, and why he believes bitcoin offers a platform for potential solutions.\n\nFrom 2003 t0 2012, I built up and ran a technology blog called ReadWriteWeb (RWW). At its peak, it had over 20 people working for it, nearly all of them in the US.\n\nThe fact I could manage this business virtually, from New Zealand, showed the power of the Internet tools the blog evangelized. The RWW team communicated via Skype. We published on Movable Type. We managed projects on Basecamp. We scheduled meetings with GoToMeeting. We kept track of the editorial calendar using Google Calendar.\n\nThere was, however, one crucial component missing in our virtual office: a decent tool for online payments. And we had to do a lot of online payment processing; paying staff and accepting payments from our sponsors being the two most important. The closest we got to a viable tool was PayPal, but we quickly learned to avoid it.\n\nPayPal\'s fees for international payments were (and still are) exorbitant. What we ended up using was the international banking system, SWIFT. It was full of red tape, the bank\'s online software was buggy, and often we found that one or more intermediary banks had taken a chunk of money during the process.\n\nIn short, the banking system was opaque and frustrating… but even then it was better than PayPal.\n\nMy overly long point is this: Online payments aren’t yet solved. Bitcoin may be the solution.\n\nThe promise of a PayPal killer\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency.\n\nAs I type this, its value is $372.57. It fluctuates a lot, which is part of the reason it’s not quite ready to be a PayPal killer. But the underlying system is solid.\n\nI won’t go into the technical definition of bitcoin, but simply put, there are two main uses for bitcoin currently:\n\nAs a digital asset, similar to holding gold or trading foreign currencies. You can either buy bitcoins or ""mine” them for this purpose. (Currently being a digital asset is by far bitcoin’s main use case). As a form of online payment. This is still a minority activity with Bitcoin, but as the currency stabilises, this use case will become more prominent.\n\nWhat makes bitcoin more appealing than PayPal or credit cards?\n\nFor a start, the fees are much less extravagant. You may not even need to pay any transaction fee, although bitcoin\'s website suggests that paying a small fee could speed up the transaction.\n\nBitcoin is also appealing because it is essentially a universal currency. So, there aren’t onerous currency conversion procedures to go through – which are always a \'gotcha\' with international bank transfers, PayPal transactions and credit card payments.\n\nWho accepts bitcoin?\n\nA number of mainstream goods and services websites have begun to accept bitcoin as payment — including WordPress, OKCupid, Expedia and Microsoft.\n\nPerhaps the biggest retailer so far is Overstock, which began accepting bitcoin in January 2014.\n\nThe founder of Overstock, Patrick Byrne, tweeted that month:\n\n#Bitcoin\'s first full day on @overstock.com was a huge success: 840 orders, $130,000 in sales. Almost all new customers. #stunned — Patrick Byrne (@OverstockCEO) January 10, 2014\n\nByrne is a big advocate of bitcoin, although it should be noted that Overstock itself does not accept bitcoin. Instead it partnered with a third-party company, Coinbase, to accept bitcoin on its behalf. Coinbase then pays Overstock in US dollars, though it does keep some bitcoin reserves.\n\nThis way Overstock avoids the risks of holding bitcoin – especially the volatility of bitcoin\'s value.\n\nSo if you\'re a retail company or startup, or offering services online, should you accept bitcoin? It can\'t hurt to add it as an option, although Overstock\'s experience suggests that it\'s not straightforward to set up.\n\nPaying in bitcoin\n\nWhat about from the other side of the coin (so to speak). Should you use bitcoin as a consumer? It’s a viable option if you live in a country that makes it easy for you to purchase bitcoin.\n\nUnfortunately, my own country is not one of those. Foiled again! But those of you in the US and much of Europe are well served with bitcoin vendors.\n\nCoinbase is one of the most established bitcoin ventures. Backed by VC luminaries like Fred Wilson and Chris Dixon, Coinbase offers a bitcoin buy and sell exchange as well as a ""wallet"" to hold your bitcoins (similar to a bank account).\n\nBut even if you have access to a slick service like Coinbase, there are risks in using bitcoin to purchase goods and services. Apart from the volatility of the price, there is a lack of consumer protection.\n\nAs the US Federal Trade Commission warned in June 2015:\n\n""…payments made with virtual currencies aren\'t reversible and don\'t have the same legal protections as some traditional payment methods. Once you hit send, you can’t get your money back unless the seller agrees.""\n\nThe opportunities\n\nIt\'s clear that bitcoin isn\'t ideal for online payments at this time.\n\nAs a retailer, compared to existing currencies it\'s not straight forward to receive payment in bitcoin. And as a consumer, it isn\'t universally available and (where it is available) it carries risks.\n\nBut that\'s one reason why startups exist: to overcome obstacles to adoption of a new technology. There are opportunities for startups to make it easier for retailers and consumers, and to widen access to the exchange of bitcoin.\n\nOne particular use case I\'m excited about with bitcoin is its potential to enable the long sought after business model of micropayments. This is the practice of paying a tiny amount for a good or service.\n\nFor example, paying $0.10 cents to read an article on a news website. Because of ad blockers and the rapid decline of online advertising revenue, publishers are currently struggling.\n\nMicropayments perhaps offers an alternative revenue source. At the very least, it’s worth experimenting with and I applaud startups that are putting forward potential solutions.\n\nOne such startup is called SatoshiPay. It\'s named after bitcoin’s mythical creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Also, ""satoshi"" is the accepted term for the smallest fraction of a bitcoin: currently set at 0.00000001 BTC.\n\nSatoshiPay bills itself as an enabler of ""bitcoin nanopayments"" and asks us to ""imagine a web where you can purchase an article, image or video for 1 cent."" It’s early days for the company – it only just announced its seed funding – but SatoshiPay is a good example of how bitcoin could drive innovation in online payments.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, bitcoin isn’t yet ready to dethrone PayPal as king of online payments.\n\nIndeed PayPal itself may yet evolve into a key bitcoin payments processing company – although CoinBase has gotten the first mover advantage on that front. But once bitcoin’s volatility settles down (which may be a while, on the evidence of a recent schism in its developer ranks), bitcoin has clear technical advantages over PayPal, banks and credit cards for online payments.\n\nOne thing is for certain: bitcoin is in the process of disrupting Paypal. And for that we should be thankful.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Medium and has been republished here with the author\'s permission.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Established in April 2013, Korbit is Korea's first Bitcoin Exchange and a provider of blockchain-related services. The company announced a new service yesterday, Hyphen, which they describe as “an aggregator for cross-border payouts settled via distributed ledgers.”\n\nThe description does the service little justice, however. In effect, Hyphen replaces a lot of what we use banking for today but uses the blockchain and a robust, public API. Designed for enterprise use, Hyphen was made to be plugged into the back-end of online marketplaces, consumer apps and financial services.\n\nThere are many use cases for Hyphen; Remittances can be sent through it, all the way to the recipients’ ATM machine; Businesses can use it to mass-pay their employees, all around the globe; Freelance marketplaces, like Upwork or eLance, can use it to pay their earners; The service can also be used for reward programs.\n\nAlthough the service has a blockchain backbone, users never have to exchange any cryptocurrency nor worry about volatility risk. Recipients of Hyphen powered payments get to choose between a bank transfer and an ATM cash pickup, and the sender pays the flat one percent fee. In a lucrative twist, Hyphen also claims that the platform passes on arbitrage opportunities to the client, “which can lead to FX rates that are better than the actual ‘mid-market’ rates.”\n\nWith limited resources to achieve geographic coverage, the service is only available in 24 countries and six currencies are supported at this time. The US, China, most of Europe, Australia, the Philippines, and of course, South Korea are covered, but the largest market for remittances, India, is missing for now. “We had to vet, and get vetted by, each local payout partner to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations,” said Tony Lyu, Korbit’s CEO.\n\nWhile there are a lot of bitcoin-to-cash payout services, and a lot of potential payout partners, “there was no cost-effective way to piece them together,” said Tony Lyu, Korbit’s CEO. Korbits solution is to communicate with a multitude of APIs, which Hyphen bundles into a single API for payments.\n\nKorbit revealed that several companies, including one of the largest mobile payments apps in Korea, have begun integrating Hyphen into their settlement workflows. The company expects the more clients to use the network when the service goes live, in March.\n\n- Tony Lyu, Korbit CEO\n\nIn addition to Hyphen, and the original Korean exchange, Korbit has launched several other products. The company has raised over US$3.6 million in funding from a group of investors including Softbank Ventures Korea, Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, Tim Draper and Naval Ravikant.\n\nThe Korbit team created Bitwire in July 2015, so that anyone can send money to a South Korean bank account. Transfers are processed and settled in less than two hours and Bitwire charges no fees. Korbit claims to have processed over US$100M through the service.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, South Korea has a population of over 50 million people and a GDP of US$1.4 trillion. Remittance inflows were US$6.48 million in 2014, which represents 0.46 percent of GDP while outflows were US$9.55 million, representing 0.68 percent of GDP.\n\nThe South Korean eCommerce sector has also been growing rapidly, largely due to mobile purchases. However, online banking is still cumbersome due to laws that require extra security software and required now-obsolete ActiveX plugins.\n\nThe South Korean government passed a law in the late '90s facilitating e-commerce security that required the use of ActiveX, a software framework released by Microsoft in 1996. Because of this law, and only because of it, Internet Explorer is always a requirement when it comes to online purchases and online banking in Korea.\n\nHowever, laws can and often do change. The South Korean Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning, announced a plan to remove 90 percent of ActiveX from e-commerce websites by 2017.\n\nAccording to an independent report from Worldpay, released in November 2015, Credit Cards are by far the most common form of payment in South Korea. However, the report predicts that credit card's dominant position will weaken over the coming years, as alternative payment methods grow from a current 17% of online payments to 27% by 2019."", 'The term “appcoin” refers to a cryptocurrency created to be a digital token paired with an application. Originally, appcoins were commonly associated with cryptoequity, but they have increasingly been designed to be essential to the use of new decentralized applications.\n\nCoinTelegraph had the opportunity to interview Mike Vine, Technology Evangelist for decentralized content distribution platform LBRY, on appcoins’ increasing use beyond cryptoequity.\n\nCoinTelegraph: What is an appcoin?\n\nMike Vine: An appcoin is a cryptocurrency that is designed specifically to power a user application, rather than to just be a means of exchange and store of value. One of the beautiful aspects of private currencies (or private anything really) is that it doesn’t have to be one-size-fits-all. We can have coins with attributes that work better for smart contracts and coins that work better for large transactions between banks and coins that work better for a hundred million people to each pay a penny to watch a music video.\n\nLBRY Credits (LBC), our built-in cryptocurrency, fit the definition perfectly.\n\nCT: How many other appcoins do you know of?\n\nMV: Namecoin is a good early example. Ethereum is a kind of meta-appcoin, designed for facilitating various applications rather than just one. But LBRY has a chance of being the first to see mass adoption by the general public – surpassing even Bitcoin in number of users. Most people won’t know or care that they’re even using cryptocurrency. They’ll just care about that song they want to download.\n\nCT: What made you decide to use an appcoin instead of Bitcoin or any other technology?\n\nMV: All of the LBRY founders are free-marketeers and Bitcoin advocates. I’ve rolled my eyes at get-rich-quick altcoin schemes since the early days. The market has shown that the bar is pretty high for what additional features will make an altcoin competitive with Bitcoin in the global currency horizontal market.\n\nEvery attempt was made to figure out how LBRY might be built on top of Bitcoin, but we eventually determined that doing so would be bad for Bitcoin and bad for LBRY. The LBRY blockchain stores particular data helpful for finding media, and it operates a naming system unlike anything available in existing cryptocoins. Names are subject to an ongoing bidding process to put into practice economic theories about efficient allocation of resources. In plain English, we hypothesize that there result of our protocol will be users being able to find the content they want simply by typing in a common sense term, like “wonderfullife” for the film It’s A Wonderful Life. Bitcoin isn’t built to allow for this naming system.\n\nAlso, LBRY will be processing oodles of micro-transactions. As the current block size debate has laid bare, Bitcoin is trending toward handling larger transactions. Perhaps Bitcoin core will adapt to handle endless micropayments, but if LBRY takes off, we certainly don’t want to be the ones to overwhelm the BTC blockchain at this stage.\n\nFinally, we do plan to do a managed rollout of the protocol. In other words, we the founders are not simply going to release our system and hope that people adopt it. That’s not how user applications traditionally succeed. In some ways, Satoshi set a deceptive precedent that you can just build something cool, release it, and let it take off. Of course, that’s not even the real story of how Bitcoin got off the ground, but it does seem to be how other cryptoapp teams are approaching their product. At this stage, we view LBRY as a network app startup like Facebook was in its early days. It will be up to us to make the strategic decisions that see user adoption grow exponentially and make the network a viable competitor to centralized services like Netflix or iTunes.\n\nBitcoin will still be a payment option on the LBRY app, but it won’t power the network. Fortunately, services like ShapeShift.io will make it easy to convert LBRY Credits to Bitcoin and back.\n\nCT: Have there been any challenges presented?\n\nMV: Hell yeah! Designing an appcoin is serious business. It’s much harder than other kinds of startups because we’re making decisions now that will be very hard to change in the future – and we’re doing it with essentially no empirical information about how the protocol will actually be used. So that’s why we’re going to take our time in the alpha release stage before the genesis block comes out.\n\nI will say that our team’s understanding of economics is a major asset here, as it clearly was for Satoshi. We can use a priori principles to guide our design of this market toward the goals we set for it.\n\nCT: Do you see a possibility where (intentionally or not) your appcoin becomes an altcoin, and competes with Bitcoin as a currency?\n\nMV: Yes, any appcoin has the potential to overtake Bitcoin. In the commodity world, it’s hard to find something that can compete with gold as money because of gold’s unique physical properties and distinctiveness, yet even there some people prefer to hold platinum because it is much more useful in building the high-tech equipment which defines our age. On the other hand, platinum is much more volatile because is has predominantly non-monetary uses. There is a strong argument that you do want to have a resource that is used primarily as money. LBRY Credits are not designed to outcompete Bitcoin in that role.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin adoption levels off and LBRY apps are used by billions of people, then cryptocurrency speculators and users may decide that they feel more comfortable holding and using an asset that has a more widely-demanded end use.\n\nCT: In the past, appcoins have primarily been associated with cryptoequity, whose main purpose is to raise capital for a project. Do you share the same vision for your coin, or are you going for more of a functionality aspect?\n\nMV: The value of LBRY Inc. is predicated on reserving a small share of Credits to the company, so there is a cryptoequity aspect to it. But we disagree with the notion of issuing another altcoin simply to make money from speculators. An appcoin should be designed around a specific goal for end users. Bitcoin is the generalist, and appcoins are the specialists. Meanwhile, common sense tells entrepreneurs that if it’s practical to build your app on top of Bitcoin, do it! You’ll instantly get the benefit of the most robust mining network of any cryptocurrency and a massive existing user base.', 'Bitcoin-Symbolbild\n\nDas Bitcoin zugrunde liegende Konzept könne helfen, Missbildungen des Kapitalismus auszumerzen, waren sich Experten auf dem Medienfestival Transmediale einig.\n\nDie Blockchain, die weiten Kreisen der Bevölkerung noch gar nichts sagen dürfte, gilt Vordenkern in Politik und Finanzwirtschaft vermehrt als Wundermittel. Der Hype um das aus der Bitcoin-Welt stammende digitale Pendant zur Notarrolle oder zum Kassenregister sei zwar ""falsch"", wies der Amsterdamer Programmierer Denis Rojo alias Jaromil allzu hochfliegende Erwartungen an die dezentrale Buchhaltung in einer verteilten Datenbank am Freitag auf der Transmediale in Berlin zurück. Unterschätzen dürfe man die Technik aber auch nicht.\n\n""In der Blockchain gehören den Schürfern, den direkt Beteiligten die Produktionsmittel"", führte Jaromil aus. Dass sich damit eine alte Forderung von Karl Marx erfülle, sei ""nach wie vor entscheidend"". In anderen Formen der Sharing Economy jenseits von Bitcoin und vergleichbaren Kryptotechniken, die auf dem digitalen Vertrauensverzeichnis basieren, sei dies nicht so. So könnten etwa Uber oder Airbnb jederzeit ein Kundenkonto mitten in einer Transaktion sperren, sodass der Nutzer im schlechtesten Fall wortwörtlich auf der Straße stehe.\n\nDem Programmierer zufolge sorgt die Blockchain nicht nur für eine sichere Basis für Geschäfte oder ""intelligente Verträge"", sondern lässt sich für zahlreiche Projekte nutzen. Im Kern gehe es darum, Dinge transparent zu machen. ""Damit können wir Organisationen errichten, die nicht auf alte, absterbende Institutionen angewiesen sind"", meint Jaromil, der selbst am Bitcoin-Ableger Freecoin und dem Forschungsprojekt D-Cent beteiligt ist. Letzteres arbeitet an Instrumenten und Anwendungen für die stärkere Beteiligung der Bürger am politischen, gesellschaftlichen und wirtschaftlichen Geschehen und nutzt dazu unter anderem das Belohnungssystem der Blockkette.\n\nNeue Transparenz dank Blockchain\n\nDer Theoretiker und Künstler hält es nicht nur mit Marx, sondern auch mit Bertolt Brecht und dessen Appell zur Umfunktionierung. Der Lyriker habe damit auf die Möglichkeit abgestellt, eine neue Botschaft auszusenden, auch wenn die Technik oder die Bühne die gleiche bleibe. Für Jaromil wäre es so eine ""verschenkte Gelegenheit"", wenn die Gesellschaft die Produktionsmittel und Werkzeuge, die auf der Blockchain aufsetzen, nicht ""im sozialen Sinne"" nutze.\n\nDas höre sich verführerisch an, kommentierte ein Teilnehmer des Medienkunstfestivals den Vortrag. Es stelle sich aber die Frage, welche Agenda damit verfolgt werde. Die im Silicon Valley entstehende Spezies ""Techno Sapiens"" sehe in Systemen wie der Regierung oder der Demokratie jedenfalls keinen echten Nutzen mehr.\n\nDie Techno-Elite hänge nach wie vor einer gewissen Cyberpunk-Ideologie an, in der sich alles um die Freiheit – auch vom Staat – drehe, räumte der britische Designer Vinay Gupta ein. Dies sei aber gerade in den USA nicht verwunderlich, wenn die Demokratie dort den Krieg gegen den Terror gebracht habe und nichts ausrichte gegen einen ""massiven Machtmissbrauch des militärisch-industriellen Komplexes"".\n\nGupta sang ebenfalls ein Loblied auf die Blockchain und die damit ermöglichten Vertragsformen, da sie helfen könnten, Fehlentwicklungen des Kapitalismus wie Monopole und Korruption einzuhegen. ""Wenn der Code einmal läuft, haben alle die gleiche Umgebung und das gleiche Ergebnis"", führte der Berater aus. So hätten alle eine Chance und Netzwerkeffekte, die zentralen Plattformen wie Facebook oder Google in die Hände spielen, könnten sich nicht mehr so stark auswirken. Die ""radikale Transparenz"" der Technik mache es zudem schwierig, Entscheider zu bestechen.\n\nDie Zeit ist für Gupta daher reif, um die Einsatzbereiche der Blockkette auszuweiten und mit dieser jenseits von Bitcoin zu experimentieren. Die Zivilgesellschaft hinke beim Entwickeln einschlägiger Anwendungen dem Finanzsektor bereits hinterher, da dieser das Verfahren für die ""finale Verbindung zwischen Datenbanken und dem Netzwerk"" unglaublich schnell annehme. Eine parallele Möglichkeit, das Eigentum an Produktionsmitteln zu demokratisieren, sieht Gupta in Ansätzen zum Crowdfunding, bei denen Aktien vergeben werden. Das funktioniere ähnlich wie bei Kickstarter, man erhalte aber bei einem Investment direkt Anteile an Firmen. (Stefan Krempl) / (jo)\n\n', 'Halsey Minor has had remarkable entrepreneurial career by any standard. He was an early business partner of Jeff Bezos; practically invented the online tech media business when he co-founded CNET in 1994, and he’s invested in and started many companies besides that.\n\nNow, after a dark period that saw him battling the demons of depression and bankruptcy, he’s back with big plans to disrupt the banks. That’s full-circle for a man who started his career not in technology, but as a banker.\n\nThis is his story.\n\nDreaming of making an impact\n\nAs a high school graduate Minor dreamt of a life helping developing countries to build infrastructure like roads and dams, working with an organisation like the International Monetary Fund. With that in mind, he went to college and studied anthropology and Arabic (“in the 80s the Arab world had all the money”) at college before taking a job in corporate finance with Merril Lynch on Wall Street as a final stepping stone towards his goal, but it was there his plans changed.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock\n\n“All I can say is I got very disillusioned with investment banking and it was nothing like what I was thinking about,” Minor says. “So, I immediately flipped over to my other passion, which was computers.”\n\nThus began a life as a full-time technology entrepreneur. But even at college, Virginia-born Minor was showing signs of his future career when he started a business called the Rental Network.\n\n“I put three different computers around town and there was a database of apartments. You could go to, for instance, the bookstore and use a joystick and say, ‘I want a two-bedroom apartment in this part of town and I want to pay this amount of money,’ and it would spit out a list with a printer.”\n\nIt being the 1980s, these computers weren’t connected to the internet, and Minor had to manually update each computer’s database with a disk each week. He knew how the network technology emerging at the time could help but he had a choice to make. “I sincerely had to decide between (going) to Boston and trying to do this for all the university students there, or accepting the job at Merrill Lynch in corporate finance.\n\nDespite his efforts to keep the Rental Network going in addition to his Merrill Lynch job, it died as he focused on his Wall Street career.\n\nA young man named Jeff Bezos\n\nAfter he left investment banking, Minor got back into technology, first with an early hypertext system. “I used a tool that (Microsoft co-founder) Paul Allen created called ‘Asymetrix ToolBook’, and it allowed me to build the equivalent on PCs of what HyperCard was on the Mac.”\n\nJust as that project was coming to an end at the start of the 1990s Minor met a young Jeff Bezos, then more associated with Wall Street than the retail and technology worlds he would revolutionize a few years later with Amazon.\n\nCredit: Amazon A young(er) Jeff Bezos in his Amazon days\n\n“We formed a partnership to launch a thing called ‘Worldwatch,’” Minor says. “That was going to take six different newsfeeds, and we were going to parse it based on content and then send it around to all the bankers based on the content. Bloomberg does that today in their sleep, so it’s not needed, but there were a couple of companies that were starting this, either to deliver a customised fax newspaper or even customised emails.\n\n“Merrill was going to put up $750,000 to do this (but) they ended up losing a bunch of money in 1990 and they cancelled the project. So, Jeff and I were going to try to raise capital that was otherwise coming from Merrill to do this, to do this publishing thing.\n\n“I got on the phone with Jeff and we both decided that we weren’t going to be able to raise money and this didn’t make sense and we were going to go our own ways. I was crushed.”\n\nBuilding CNET\n\nMinor might have been crushed but he managed to pick himself up and launch another startup that combined technology and publishing. CNET hit the World Wide Web in 1993. While most associate it with technology news and reviews, there was more to it than that – it was a suite of products both public-facing and behind the scenes.\n\n“For like four years, all we did was build services that I had wanted forever, so it was very natural. CNET was just really a culmination of some skills that I had and just a passion I had for the tech industry,” says Minor.\n\n“I had this experience doing this online publishing stuff and I was just rabid about technology press. It’s what I love, so I literally just built on the internet the company that I wanted to… I built my own product, really. Everything I built was just stuff I wanted as a consumer, so it was really easy for me.”\n\nFor example, Download.com launched as part of CNET in 1996. It acted as an online hub for software that was at the time more commonly given away on floppy disks and CDs stuck to the front of computer magazines, or available on disparate sites spread around the nascent Web.\n\nWhile companies like Vox Media, Gawker Media and BuzzFeed are noted these days for building their own proprietary content management systems (CMS), this wasn’t just a strategic luxury in the mid-90s, it was essential. The ‘StoryServer’ CMS was spun out from CNET as a commercial product through a company called Vignette Corporation.\n\nAs a major player in online publishing, CNET contributed to shaping the online media landscape we know today. It helped launch the Internet Advertising Bureau (now the Interactive Advertising Bureau) in 1996, for one.\n\n“I started the Internet Advertising Bureau with a reporter from PC Week,” says Minor. “We invited the internet advertising industry leaders to CNET to kick off the process. We produced five cable TV shows about technology at the time, and the idea was to be modeled on the CAB, or Cable Advertising Bureau.”\n\nHowever, Minor says that after the first meeting, the problems with a publisher running such an initiative became clear. “Some people in the industry… were afraid we were going to pick up additional advertising dollars as a result of our leadership… I stepped back because the most important thing was that the IAB be formed, not that I lead it.”\n\nThen in 1999 CNET trumpeted the “the first-ever editorial and disclosure policy to be posted on an internet media site,” ethical guidelines that made clear the distinction between commerce and editorial. While this ‘church and state’ distinction had long been established in print media, the online world was still more of a ‘wild west’ that needed to grow up as more people became active internet users.\n\nPart of CNET’s 1999 press release announcing its ‘church and state’ policy.\n\nGrowing up\n\nIt wasn’t just ‘the internet’ that needed to grow up, so did attitudes to it from traditional media.\n\n“At that point, the internet was all about being a medium and so it was the most exciting and interesting time of my life because I was… fighting for credibility of this new medium when the world at large gave us no credibility,” says Minor. “The Wall Street Journal would republish our stories and they wouldn’t even give us credit, so the passion there was really to actually allow the internet to be considered an authoritative source for content.”\n\nCNET acted as an incubator for other companies. Snap.com (a search portal) and BuyDirect.com (an ecommerce site) were developed in-house before being spun out. Snap became a joint venture with NBC, with the broadcaster owning 60 percent of the company, and Minor acting as CEO. At one point Snap had more traffic than CNET itself but it ultimately failed. Meanwhile, BuyDirect was acquired by another online retailer, beyond.com for $130 million in 1998.\n\nCredit: The Internet Archive What it looked like to buy software online in 1996.\n\nCNET became profitable in 1998 and Minor left the company in February 2000. He’s satisfied with what he’d built. “We were a NASDAQ-100 company. We had $367 million in retained earnings and another $1.1 billion of unrealised gains from Vignette, so we had been incredibly profitable, unlike everybody else.\n\n“That quarter we grew 130 percent year-over-year, and I literally accomplished everything I ever imagined that I could accomplish and more.”\n\nHe already knew what he wanted to focus on next.\n\nA force to be reckoned with\n\n“I was the co-founder and second-largest shareholder in Salesforce, and I’d put $19.5 million into Salesforce in 1999. Marc (Benioff) wasn’t the CEO; he wasn’t the CEO until about two-and-a-half years into it. A guy named John Dillon was and so I left (CNET) to try to help build Salesforce.”\n\nMinor is keen that history doesn’t forget John Dillon, now that Salesforce is a juggernaut intrinsically linked to the charismatic Benioff.\n\n“Salesforce was really just a combination of me with publishing skills – Web publishing skills – and Marc with deep enterprise skills. Then John Dillon… he’s kind of been forgotten by history, but he did a phenomenal job really building Salesforce for the first two-and-a-half years.\n\n“He was very different than Marc; Marc was kind of swimming with the dolphins and John was a submarine commander, former submarine commander, but that company went 3 million in revenue, 20 million, 50 million, while the rest of dotcom was melting down.”\n\nAfter his stint with Salesforce, Minor says he retired for a couple of years but returned to the fray in July 2003 to ‘save’ a company that he’d invested in, GrandCentral.\n\n“I was living in Virginia and the board asked me to move back to San Francisco and take over the company. No one was going to put in any additional capital, including myself, unless management was changed. Our house was on the market in San Francisco and our kids had been told that we were going to remain in Virginia.\n\n“The company was in horrible shape with 35 people when I arrived, with everyone feuding, and I had to reduce the number of people to eight very shortly thereafter. It was a horrible experience and I promised myself I would never knowingly do a turnaround again.”\n\nMinor’s GrandCentral was a B2B platform that focused on interoperability of applications and services. However, this wasn’t the company that GrandCentral that Google later acquired and turned into Google Voice.\n\n“Halsey did our Series A investment as a VC,” says Craig Walker, co-founder and CEO of the ‘second’ GrandCentral. “As we were looking for names to call the company, Halsey offered to sell us ‘GrandCentral’ and the domain of www.grandcentral.com.”\n\nThe second GrandCentral was offered a service that allowed people to have one phone number, voicemail and messaging inbox linked to all their phone lines. Google acquired this company for $45 million in June 2007.\n\nDarker times\n\nAs you might imagine, Minor had become wealthy as a result of his various business interests. Salesforce had gone public in 2004, and one year after Google bought GrandCentral, CBS bought CNET for $1.8 billion. However, Minor’s life wasn’t without its darker shades.\n\nMinor says that he had never met his father. “I went looking for him in 1998, after I was on the cover of Forbes.”\n\nCredit: Forbes Halsey Minor on the cover of Forbes magazine in 1998.\n\nHe discovered that his father had killed himself 30 miles from San Francisco after battling depression, just a month after Minor had moved to the city.\n\nThe biggest setback to his career, though, followed his divorce in 2006.\n\n“I, around 2007, went into depression and basically sort of disappeared,” he explains.\n\nAs Minor was battling a six-year period of depression, the great recession of 2008 occurred and eventually he went into personal bankruptcy. It’s a combination understandably he found difficult to deal with.\n\n“I didn’t talk to anyone. Often, I didn’t even show up in (bankruptcy) court, because I was basically in my house all the time.”\n\nAn addiction to the finer things in life?\n\nThis silence on Minor’s part led others to fill in the gaps in the story. In May 2013, Bloomberg speculated that “a fascination with houses, hotels, horses and art” was at the root of his money problems, due to the list of extravagant assets listed in his bankruptcy filing that spring.\n\nCredit: Mail Online How the Daily Mail covered Minor’s bankruptcy.\n\n“That was a really easy story to write, because that’s what people want to believe. That’s not what happened,” Minor says.\n\n“It’s a lot more complex than saying that it was fast cars, fast women, and whatever. It just wasn’t. The primary issue was that I always thought that my father – who I never met – and I were different, because I’ve always been very optimistic and very proactive and forward looking and whatever. I’ve never considered myself a depressive, but when I went through my divorce, it just upended my world. “When people go through a divorce, it upends their world in the best of cases. Mine was followed by the complete collapse of the economy, having loans with banks, and then having to get into fights with the assets being encumbered, and all kinds of crazy stuff. I just wasn’t prepared, at that time, to be able to… I think I’m generally fairly forward-looking, and I think I’m generally a very good decision maker. I was neither forward-looking nor a decision maker during that time. “There’s nothing that suggests that I was driving Ferraris around and building 100,000 square-foot houses; none of that was going on. The irony is, the horses that I owned actually made money. I ended up buying one horse that had a foal, that became the leading two-year-old filly in the country, and was worth $4 million, but it just all went to (the late wine entrepreneur and race horse enthusiast) Jess Jackson.”\n\nMinor’s involvement with racehorses was celebrated in some quarters. A 2009 Horse Racing Business article supported his attempts at the time to acquire bankrupt racetrack operator Magna Entertainment Corp, stating “The racing fraternity should embrace Minor with open arms, as a force for change and experimentation – a straw that stirs the drink.”\n\nThe banking crisis, Minor says, was the catalyst for his troubles.\n\n“The problem was, I got into a bunch of fights with banks that were, themselves, in dire straits – Merrill, and then, of course, Silverton, which was financing my hotel. They were seized by the FDIC. I’ll tell you, you don’t fight the town hall, and you don’t fight banks. That was because I basically turned my life over to lawyers. “I’m not blaming the lawyers; I’m just saying… nobody fixes problems when they’re paid by the hour.”\n\nMinor says that although he did own a number of houses, this was a strategy to save landmark houses from development, rather than simply owning a string of mansions for the status of it.\n\n“Look, I’ll never be able to prove anything, because the net result was that the only way that I could move forward in my life was just to basically put everything behind me. But I think, when you look back over the long arc of my life, I think it’s going to be very clear that whatever happened, that was a very unique period. Because it’s not consistent with everything that happened before, and it certainly does not appear consistent with everything that’s happened since.’ ”\n\nCall it a comeback\n\nWith a troubled few years behind him, Minor is back doing what he loves with two new companies, Uphold and Voxelus.\n\nUphold, Minor hopes, will be the future of money. After launching in 2014 as a Bitcoin-focused service called Bitreserve, it’s now relaunched, starting off by offering a free currency transfer and exchange service.\n\n“What we’re really trying to do is create cloud-based money. In a sense, I guess you could say Bitcoin was the first cloud-based money because it’s just a bunch of servers out there that keep track of it. But the idea was to extend that concept into and make it more convenient by essentially making all currencies instant and free to exchange,” Minor says of the business where he serves as Chair and founder. Former Nike CIO Anthony Watson serves as Uphold CEO.\n\nSo, instead of transferring money from your bank account to your friend’s, you’d store your money with Uphold and then sending it to any other Uphold user is free. What’s particularly interesting here is that Uphold is entirely free to the user.\n\n“The bet is that our costs are so low running a cloud-based money service that ultimately we can make money and be profitable, just based on reinvesting the proceeds that we’re holding.”\n\n“It’s a very different take on… just about everybody today – PayPal, banks, etc. – they all make money on the transference of money; they make fees. They’re called payment networks. We decided you’d get a different kind of banking infrastructure where we’re free; others can charge to connect to us if they want, but ultimately our business funds itself through the reinvestment of the proceeds that we hold. We do it transparently so we don’t do stupid things, hopefully.”\n\n“We’re a pretty radical departure from really just about everybody in FinTech, because just about everybody has a fee-based model. We’re really not trying to replace the payment networks; honestly, we’re a replacement for banks. We want you to hold your money in Uphold so that you can send it to anybody instantly, at no cost, and do free foreign exchange.”\n\nReplacing the banks\n\nThe next stage with Uphold will be to issue debit cards, so users can spend their Uphold funds with retailers. Minor sees a future five years from now where traditional banks are taken out of the equation entirely.\n\n“We’re actually probably more different than just about any other service in that we really are trying to create a separate monetary system that connects to all the others, but one that’s completely free, and transparent, and instant… In five years you (won’t) need to hold your money in a very expensive, physical bank someplace; you hold your money in the cloud and you use your phone to transact.”\n\nUphold promotional video\n\nStoring and moving money fluidly at no cost sounds good but only if you accept one way that Uphold will be making money – investing the funds it holds.\n\n“The big bet that we’re taking is that more and more money will come into this system that we’re building and that we will be able to invest those proceeds in liquid assets, not like banks where they go into consumer credit. We’ll never do consumer credit, but as those assets accrete over time we’ll invest them in highly liquid assets, and we’ll do it in a fully transparent way so people always know what the risk is.”\n\nMinor says Uphold is playing it safe. “We have in reserve 102 percent of the amount of money we owe, so we’re actually over-reserved. Unlike a bank that will have 17 percent or 18 percent, we have 102 percent in liquid reserves.”\n\nAdditionally, Uphold will partner with peer-to-peer lending firms to offer low-cost consumer credit to users.\n\nAddressing the potential criticism that this will only work well if everyone puts their money into Uphold, Minor says that he’s thinking of the service as being like Facebook – you don’t have to use it to communicate with other people online, but there are significant network effects and benefits of scale that you benefit from if you do.\n\nMeanwhile, an API will allow others to build on top of the service. Minor says that Wells Fargo has already used it to build an app for its supply chain.\n\n“I think (the API) is going to be of massive non-consumer use. Right now you can orchestrate the flow of goods and services, but you can’t orchestrate the flow of money, because banks don’t really have APIs that you can use,” says Minor. “So, I think we’ll become a massive tool for the ability to connect the flow of goods and services, to connect the flow of money so that you can reward people dynamically, based on the materials showing up.”\n\nWhat does Minor think of taking on the banks? They’re formidable opponents, no?\n\n“The banks, to me, of all of the competitors I’ve had – and I include the magazines and enterprise software companies and telephone companies, with Google Voice and so on – they’re sort of the least prepared to make any changes at all.\n\n“At Salesforce, we offered small and big companies the opportunity to adopt new, more competitive infrastructure. Some companies adopted Salesforce and some still haven’t today; some still haven’t adopted the cloud model, despite how much better it is and how much cheaper it is, but I don’t see in banks, quite frankly, any interest and willingness to change.\n\n“You see people making these statements, like Jamie Dimon, like, ‘Our ‘Uber moment’ is upon us,’ but I don’t really think that any of them are really taking it seriously. I think it’s only when the banks actually start seeing it show up in their own financial numbers, or any business when they actually start seeing it happen where they can directly attributable a fall in their profitability to the rise in somebody else’s, it’s only then when people start taking it seriously.\n\n“The difference between the banks and everybody else is when I started CNET there were 300,000 people on the Internet. I could only grow as fast as the Internet could grow, so the magazines had, quite frankly, a very long time to adapt. They didn’t, but they had a very long time to adapt if they had wanted to. Actually, (US publisher) Ziff Davis did fairly well because we ended up buying ZDNet, even though the magazines ended up going bankrupt several times.\n\n“We have 3 billion people on the Internet today, roughly, give or take a few hundred million. All of these people have seen time and time again that whatever is new has brought real consumer benefit, so people are much more down with trying something new now than they were when I was launching CNET and everything was new and nothing was proven.\n\n“So, now the new is always equated with positive attributes as a consumer, and there are 3 billion of them ready to change. So, I think banks going last is going to be the worst possible position because people are prepared to make changes, and you’ve got 3 billion of them that can do it relatively rapidly.”\n\n“I think other than banks making statements and saying, ‘We’re doing blockchain stuff,’ which, as you and I know, doesn’t really mean anything… other than some very broad statements and partnerships and think tanks and whatever, I don’t see people preparing their infrastructure and figuring out how they’re going to… dramatically cut their internal costs to match people like me, who are running everything out of the cloud, running on Amazon Web Services, without big branches or mainframe computers.”\n\nTackling virtual reality\n\nAside from Uphold, Minor’s other current project is Voxelus, a platform that aims to democratize VR content creation.\n\n“The idea is to allow people to be able to create – not too dissimilar from the way Minecraft operates – but allow people to be able to build their own experiences. And we’re already multiplayer so you can jump in. Unlike Minecraft, there’s not a single aesthetic that you have to sign up for,” he says.\n\nVoxelus demo video\n\nAs well as individuals, the platform will cater to businesses that want to create branded VR experiences. As of this March, a marketplace will allow users to sell their creations to others.\n\n“The goal there is to do what YouTube did over a very long period of time, which is to create an ecosystem that allows people to get paid for their work. What I wanted to do is I just wanted to accelerate it.”\n\nMinor sees Uphold and Voxelus as complementary businesses and the two are tied together by the idea of cloud-based currency.\n\n“As it turned out, the whole concept of virtual currencies came out of gaming. (Now shuttered Bitcoin exchange) Mt. Gox was originally an exchange for Magic: The Gathering players, so the whole notion of virtual currency basically was created because a lot of big games have their own internal currency.\n\nVoxelus has an internal currently called the voxel, which is a fork of Litecoin.\n\n“I can give the voxel all these capabilities, like easy to buy with dollars, euros, and credit cards, etc. on Uphold, so it’s sort of a combination of the business model of both companies,” says Minor. “We’ll see how it goes, but I’m fairly bullish right now that I don’t see any reason why it shouldn’t work.”\n\nThe concept of a VR platform backed up by a virtual currency sounds very similar to Linden Lab’s forthcoming Project Sansar. Linden Lab has made a huge success of the economy in Second Life, so there’s precedent for what Voxelus is looking to achieve.\n\nMinor isn’t familiar with Project Sansar, “but I think there is a broader movement going on, which is people not just as players of games but people being able to add their own creative touches to the worlds that they are involved in and participating in. I think that’s where most of the growth is going to be, particularly with VR.”\n\nOn the up\n\nAfter having had extreme success followed by a significant low patch, Minor has emerged from it with a philosophical viewpoint and come to terms with his father’s suicide.\n\n“I always had a great deal of resentment for what (my father) did. Having gone through depression myself, I developed a lot more compassion for him, and I developed, quite frankly, a lot more compassion for myself. These things, you never sign up for them, but I have to tell you, I’m a stronger person as a result of everything that’s happened.\n\n“I’ve delivered, I think, an incredible lesson to my children that when things don’t go your way – which sometimes they don’t; sometimes they go disastrously wrong – you still get right back up again and you do it again. Quite frankly, I hope, when all is said and done, that this is instructive for other people who’ve been through similar experiences to know that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n“You can get past this and you can go on and be every bit as successful as you were before, and hopefully, in my case, even more so.”\n\n___\n\nThis piece was edited shortly after publication to clarify details around the story of GrandCentral.\n\nRead next: I almost managed a week using only my iPad... but one thing held me back']"
02/07/2016,"['Jason Leibowitz is a former Wall Street professional who pivoted careers in 2014 to focus full-time on digital currency.\n\nIn this paper, Leibowitz answers questions about how bitcoin was created, how it works and why it matters.\n\nIt has been described as a ""techno tour de force"" by Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and as a ""remarkable cryptographic achievement…that has enormous value"" by Google CEO, Eric Schmidt. It was even predicted by Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman in 1999 when he said, ""The one thing that’s missing, but will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash.""\n\nFriedman was a visionary, and in this instance he was a decade ahead of the rest, foreseeing the advent of digital currency, and more specifically, bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin’s rise to prominence is causing a global rethink of the concept of money. For thousands of years, gold was the currency of the land, and many of gold\'s qualities have allowed it to stand the test of time. As civilization developed and industrialized, ruling bodies learned that printing a government’s own currency, called fiat, was a more convenient and easier method of distributing wealth in society.\n\nHowever, government-backed money has not stood the test of time; the average life of fiat currency is only 27 years. History is littered with examples of the failure of money, such as the Mark in post-WWI Weimar Germany and the Greek drachma in 1944.\n\nFast forward to the 21st century, where there are more mobile phones than there are people on earth, and perhaps it makes sense for a more global form of money to exist. Bitcoin is exactly that: a universal, internet currency that can work on any computer or mobile phone.\n\nIt is the result of decades of work in computer technology by nearly anonymous researchers, as it elegantly solves a longstanding problem in computer science. Bitcoin allows for trust between two unrelated parties over an untrustworthy network like the Internet.\n\nWith just a mobile phone any two parties can now transact without a central authority, company or bank mediating the transaction and in such a way that is safe and secure, publicly known, and uncontestable.\n\nThe origin of bitcoin\n\nSimilar to the way e-mail is a messaging rail that exists freely on the Internet for anyone to use globally 24x7, bitcoin is a payments rail that also exists freely on the Internet for anyone to use globally 24x7. Bitcoin (a crypto-currency, abbreviated BTC) was released in January of 2009 as a first-of-its-kind free payments system.\n\nIt does not require a credit card, bank account or the divulging of any personal identification to use or acquire. The catch is that you’re not using any government-backed fiat currency in this system. It uses a new currency altogether: bitcoin.\n\nBefore bitcoin was released there was a white paper entitled “Bitcoin, a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”, that was published in November 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nSatoshi is an alias, and this creator of bitcoin has chosen to remain anonymous even to this day. Thinking about the global economic environment in November of 2008 when the white paper was published, it was the early stages of what is now known as the Great Recession.\n\nBanks that were deemed ""too big to fail"" were on the verge of collapse, global stock markets were crashing, and wealth was being lost at a rapid pace.\n\nBitcoin dealt with the combination of distrust and uncertainty in the financial landscape of the time, offering a solution to the question, ""Where can someone store value if the financial system fails?"" The answer: the Internet.\n\nThe ubiquity of the internet in the 21st century is critical to the rise of Bitcoin. Of the approximately 5 billion adults in the world, over 85% have mobile phones. Even the most basic of mobile phones gives you access to a global network of communication, and bitcoin is transmittable on any network via multiple channels, including SMS text.\n\nMobile phones are becoming an increasingly important aspect of the global economy, and one interesting and relevant use case pertains to a program known as M-Pesa in Africa.\n\nM-Pesa is a mobile-based virtual currency created by Safaricom, the largest mobile network operator in Kenya. It allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money and pay for goods and services easily with any mobile device.\n\nM-Pesa stands for “mobile-money”, and was first launched approximately two years prior to bitcoin, in 2007.\n\nAnyone with a mobile phone on this network can financially transact without the use of cash, credit cards or a bank account by simply using the SMS feature to securely send and receive monetary balances. M-Pesa is setup as a branchless banking service.\n\nTo obtain the currency one simply visits any distributor and physically exchanges cash for a text message containing a converted M-Pesa balance. Businesses of all types double as M-Pesa agents, in a similar way to corner stores with ATMs, and there are approximately 40,000 agents in Kenya.\n\nM-Pesa has been praised for granting millions of people access to the formal financial system and for reducing crime in an otherwise largely cash-based society.\n\nAs of May 2015, over 40% of Kenya’s annual GDP was transacted through M-Pesa, and the success of the service has caused it to spread across three continents. However, the catch with M-Pesa is that you can only transact with someone on the same or a partnering cellular network. Bitcoin is similar in many ways to M-Pesa, only it is distributed globally for anyone to use on any network.\n\nBitcoin’s global accessibility is one of its most important features.\n\nEach year, more than $500bn is sent across international borders in the form of remittances. This is the result of millions of immigrants across the world finding work in foreign countries in order to send money back home to their families and friends. Many of them are unbanked, making the process of remitting money across borders costly and inefficient.\n\nHowever, digital currency technologies like bitcoin are disrupting traditional remittances businesses.\n\nThe most well-known money transfer companies are Western Union (WU) founded in 1851, and MoneyGram International (MGI) founded in 1940.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the average cost per user for sending remittances from G8 countries is around 10%. The high cost of remittances is due in part to the fact that there are over 10,000 employees working for traditional money-transfer corporations, with thousands of brick-and-mortar locations.\n\nThe high cost of operating these businesses is passed on to the customer through steep fees.\n\nBut in the 21st century, when transferring money is really just the instant click of a button and the update of a computerized ledger, it begs the question of whether such old-fashioned infrastructure is really necessary. Bitcoin enables users to remit money in minutes, for a fraction of the cost, using only a cell phone. Further, Bitcoin provides the rails to go from one currency to another using the Internet as a middleman (which is free) instead of companies like Western Union (not free).\n\nFor the banked population, sending money has become a relatively simple task with the advent of companies and programs such as PayPal, Venmo and Chase QuickPay.\n\nThey are easy to use and can be done from any smartphone. That said, they all require that the user has either a bank account or a credit card. The major limitation preventing these services from being a digital solution to the remittance problem is that approximately half of the adult world today is unbanked; this amounts to 2–3 billion people.\n\nGiven the high cell phone penetration discussed earlier, these numbers describe a population of at least 2 billion adults with cell phones who do not have access to credit or banking services. Bitcoin will be a bridge for this large chunk of the population to join the global financial system.\n\nWhile it’s beneficial to be banked for many reasons, it comes with its own risks. Digital crime in the form of hacking, identity theft and stolen credit and bank card information has become commonplace over the past decade. Not only have large international corporations compromised their customers’ personal identities through getting hacked (ie Sony, Target, Home Depot), but even the largest banks have fallen short of keeping their customers’ identities safe.\n\nIn 2014, JP Morgan had 83 million accounts penetrated by hackers in one of the biggest data breaches in history.\n\nOne of the thematic problems and areas of exploitation for hackers is the level of information required when using bank or credit cards. Not only does each customer need to disclose his or her card number for each transaction, but often one must disclose their billing address, phone number, e-mail address and even government identity information.\n\nCredit cards were invented in the 1950s. The technology of the magnetic strip no longer provides the security it once did; today copying a card number and relevant information is as easy as buying a card scanner for $20 on eBay.\n\nCard companies have attempted to become more secure with the advent of chip-based cards. However, criminals can still break the system, it just costs more to hack.\n\nOver 100,000 companies worldwide now accept bitcoin for payment, and to use bitcoin does not require divulging any personal identification information to the merchant. For this reason, no criminal can get into your bitcoin account and spend your money by simply hacking the servers of a company that you performed a transaction with.\n\nWhile there are benefits for individuals using bitcoin, there are also benefits for business owners in accepting bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is similar to a cash transaction for a company, which has two main advantages. First, the merchant does not have to pay a credit card company a 2–3% fee each time they swipe a card. Instead the cost for each merchant to accept bitcoin and convert it to fiat is on average less than 1%, a service provided by payment processors.\n\nIf the merchant wants to hold bitcoin then it’s a free transaction like accepting cash. Second, there are no chargebacks when accepting bitcoin. A chargeback is when a customer using a credit card makes a purchase and then decides to reverse the purchase, asking their credit card company for their money back.\n\nThe merchant takes the loss for chargebacks, which makes accepting credit cards a liability for business owners. From a merchant’s perspective, cash is always preferable because there is no fee and no risk of chargebacks.\n\nBitcoin is quite literally virtual cash. The instant convertibility into fiat currency gives merchants the same benefits as accepting greenbacks.\n\nHow bitcoin works\n\nTo better illustrate the properties of bitcoin and how it works, it is important to look under the hood. Bitcoin is a digital currency that uniquely allows users to transact without the need for a middleman or central authority.\n\nAt the user interface level it’s similar to how Venmo or PayPal works. If, for example, Bob wants to send Alice money, he will log into his account on either his phone or computer and initiate a transaction. He will need to choose how much to send (let’s say 1 BTC), and who to send it to (Alice). Bob also has the option to attach a message to the transaction. It’s behind the scenes that bitcoin differs from every other payment mechanism.\n\nBitcoin is part of what is known as the ""sharing economy"", the peer-to-peer sharing of goods and services. The most well-known examples in the sharing economy are AirBnB and Uber.\n\nWith AirBnB individuals can monetize their houses or apartments by renting them for a fee, and with Uber individuals can monetize their cars by giving passengers rides for a fee. With bitcoin, individuals can monetize their laptops and computers by sharing their processing power over the Internet in order to verify transactions on the bitcoin network.\n\nThese individuals are referred to as ""miners"", and their goal is to quickly and efficiently verify blocks of transactions in return for a reward paid out in bitcoin. Anyone with a computer who wants to earn extra money can decide to download the bitcoin software for free and become a miner, easily done by letting the program run automatically in the background of your computer.\n\nBack to the example of Bob sending Alice 1 BTC, once Bob hits the ""send"" button to initiate the transaction, it is broadcasted over the Internet to the entire network of mining computers distributed globally, all of whom are simultaneously verifying and adding approved transactions to bitcoin’s proprietary accounting ledger, known formally as the ""blockchain"".\n\nMiners are a necessity for bitcoin to work because they ensure the integrity of transactions.\n\nIn our example, miners would make sure Bob is in possession of 1 bitcoin to send, and if so, they update the Blockchain in real time so as to decrease 1 BTC from Bob’s balance and add 1 BTC to Alice’s.\n\nThe blockchain and mining\n\nThe blockchain is the key innovation that makes Bitcoin both unique and groundbreaking. It is a decentralized public ledger that tracks every transaction in bitcoin’s history.\n\nThe word ""decentralized"" is critical to understand bitcoin and the blockchain, because this is what makes it virtually impossible to hack. Companies like JP Morgan are vulnerable to cyber-attacks because the geographical locations of their computer servers can be discovered and targeted by criminals.\n\nWith bitcoin, there is no centrally owned computer or set of computers to target. Bitcoin is unique because the computers running the network are spread out globally with no entity or monetary authority in control. Unlike AirBnB and Uber, bitcoin is neither a company nor an entity.\n\nThink of bitcoin the way you think of e-mail, a peer-to-peer technology that exists freely on the Internet to make the transmitting of information more efficient.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto programmed the algorithm powering bitcoin to work in such a way that transactions would be grouped into ""blocks"" every 10 minutes. He also devised a clever reward-based incentive mechanism to maintain the validity and timeliness of the blockchain.\n\nOnce each block of transactions over a 10 minute period is solved for – meaning that a miner has verified that all transactions in the block are valid and the miner has proved to more than 50% of the rest of miners that his work was accurate — then that mined-block is added to the existing chain of previous transactions (hence ""block-chain"").\n\nMiners’ ledgers are automatically updated to reflect the latest addition to the chain, and the single miner who added the block receives a bitcoin reward. The process of verifying transactions is essentially a computer race among miners where the winner receives bitcoin.\n\nThe bitcoin code is programmed to automatically release a set amount of bitcoin to the quickest miner for every 10 minute period. This is how bitcoin are released into circulation without the need for a monetary authority.\n\nThe amount of the reward is set to halve every 210,000 blocks mined, a mechanism put in place by Satoshi in order to cap supply and limit inflation. When bitcoin was first released in 2009, the miner reward was 50 BTC for each block. In 2012, block number 210,000 was mined and so the reward was halved to 25 BTC where it remains today, meaning right now 25 bitcoins are released into circulation every 10 minutes.\n\nIt is projected that on July 23, 2016 block number 420,000 will be mined, and so the reward will halve on that date to 12.5 BTC.\n\nThe year will be 2140 by the time the halving of the bitcoin reward goes down to 0 (or parabolically close to 0 if you do the math); the amount of BTC in circulation will total 21 million, and by code no more will ever be released.\n\nThat means there will be no more Bitcoin reward for miners, but in order to maintain an incentivization scheme in the Bitcoin sharing economy the system is expected to shift from reward-based to fee-based on a per transaction basis.\n\nAt the moment this paper is being written there are 15.1m BTC in circulation.\n\nHashing to be hack-proof\n\nIn thinking about a global payments platform on the Internet, transactions are constantly taking place. Bitcoin was designed with that in mind, and a set of rules were pre-programmed so as to handle the load and make the blockchain tamper-proof.\n\nAfter a block of transactions is verified, in order to add it to the blockchain miners put it through a cryptographic process, essentially taking the details of all transactions in the block and applying a mathematical formula to the data to turn it into what is known as a hash.\n\nA hash is a seemingly random sequence of letters and numbers, and what makes it useful is it is easy to turn any amount of data (eg words, numbers, equations, details of financial transactions, etc) into a hash, but practically impossible to go backwards and turn a hash into the original data.\n\nAnother critical property of hashes is that if you change just one character in the data you are hashing, the resulting hash will be completely different. The way the blockchain is created is each block is hashed, and then the next block in the chain is hashed along with the hash from the previous block.\n\nTo demonstrate through example, it helps to analyze the first block in the entire blockchain, also known as the ""genesis block.""\n\nAfter the first block was created, miners hashed all transaction details in that block and stored the resulting string of letters and numbers (the hash) on the blockchain alongside the mined genesis block.\n\nThen the next block of transactions was verified by miners and attached chronologically after the genesis block, only this time the hash from the genesis block would also be hashed along with all the transaction details from the second block. This resulting hash would be stored alongside the second block.\n\nOnce the third block was ready to be added to the chain, miners would hash its transaction details along with the hash result from the second block, and this process would continue.\n\nIn other words, the second block contains the hash from the genesis block, the third block contains a hash from the second block which also contains the hash from the genesis block, etc. Because each block’s hash is created using the hash of the block before it, it becomes a digital version of a wax seal.\n\nIf previous blocks are changed in any way, the resulting hashes would be incorrect, and altered blocks could instantly be spotted as fakes and disregarded.\n\nPart of the mining process requires running the hashing function through the entire blockchain and proving to more than 50% of all miners that previous blocks have not been altered. This makes the blockchain tamper-proof, or in other words, hack-proof.\n\nThis cryptography running behind the scenes of Bitcoin is what gives it the classification of a cryptocurrency. It is also what prevents double spending, or the spending of the same money twice.\n\nOnce Bob sends Alice his bitcoin, miners put it through the hashing algorithm when adding the transaction to the blockchain, and ownership of that Bitcoin is transferred from Bob to Alice. Therefore, Bob cannot spend the same bitcoin again, because even if he tried miners would not approve the transaction.\n\nAs such, Bitcoin is a digitally scarce asset.\n\nThe philosophy of money\n\nSkeptics of bitcoin often point to the fact that it is not backed by anything and there is no intrinsic value. They prefer to label both fiat currencies and gold as real ""money"" because their value is backed by either a government or a rare precious metal.\n\nThe value of fiat currency is not determined by the material it is made of, rather it is the economic laws of supply and demand that dictate its value.\n\nWith regards to bitcoin not being backed by governments or gold, skeptics often overlook that a large majority of the world does not have a reliable, stable currency.\n\nOnly in the developed world do fiat currencies truly work as money, meaning they are stores of value, units of account, and mediums of exchange. More specifically, for something to be defined as money it must be able to retain its value over time, be a standard for measuring the relative worth of economic items, and be used for the buying and selling of goods and services.\n\nFiat currencies in the developed world, such as the US Dollar and the Euro, exhibit these three properties of money. That said, countries with stable fiat currencies only account for approximately 15% of the world’s population.\n\n""There are more people in the world who need a currency they can trust than there are people in the world who can trust their currency,"" says Wences Cesares, an Argentinian technology entrepreneur and CEO of Bitcoin wallet provider, Xapo.\n\nCesares knows first-hand how unreliable fiat currencies can become having lived through multiple depressions in Argentina.\n\nBitcoin, inflation and deflation\n\nAs a barometer of healthy money, the world’s best economies have average annual inflation rates below 1.5%.\n\nIn economic terms, low to zero inflation is a sign of healthy money because the value of the currency does not fluctuate significantly and is therefore reliable. However, in a country like Argentina, the annual inflation rate is estimated to be close to 40% today.\n\nThat means if you’re an Argentinian citizen and you save 100 Argentine Pesos, one year from now the value of those 100 pesos will be worth only 60 pesos relative to the world’s stable currencies. In Argentina, holding money means losing money, and so its citizens are actively looking for alternative stores of value to simply preserve the money they have earned and worked for.\n\nOther examples of problematic economies with high inflation rates are Venezuela, which is expected to have annual inflation of 180% in 2015, and Zimbabwe, where the rate of inflation for the Zimbabwean Dollar was so high that this year they decided to stop printing it and the government is abandoning their currency altogether.\n\nZimbabwe went through a period of what is known as hyperinflation; their annual inflation rate in 2008 was recorded as high as 11,000,000%. What currencies could citizens from these countries use if not their own? The US dollar? Gold? M-Pesa? Bitcoin?\n\nThe reasons for such high inflation rates are complicated and they vary from country to country, but a common theme is that these rates are only found in government-backed fiat currencies.\n\nGovernments can lose control of their money in various ways because as with all fiat currencies, their values are tied to the laws of supply and demand. If a government prints too much money then the value of its currency can deteriorate, as seen recently in Zimbabwe, and after WWI in Weimar Germany.\n\nHistory is full of stories underscored by the failures of money, and if history repeats itself, the future will be no different.\n\nGiven bouts of high volatility in bitcoin, it may be difficult to understand how this new Internet currency can act as a store of value. However, comparing the rate of fluctuation of the price of bitcoin to some of the fiat currency examples above, bitcoin contends as a candidate for an alternative currency.\n\nPart of its appeal in countries with strict currency controls is the relative ease in which it can be acquired and used, especially considering all one needs is an Internet connection. Once money is converted into bitcoin, the inflation rates of local fiat currencies do not affect bitcoin holdings and it can be sent anywhere through the Internet for free.\n\nAdditionally, no one but the account owner has access to their bitcoin. This is especially important in light of the financial crisis.\n\nIn 2013, banks in Cyprus became insolvent but were bailed out by European and international monetary authorities. However, one of the conditions for Cyprus to receive the emergency funding was that bank depositors had to pay part of the tab.\n\nThat meant depositors, those who had their money in the banks for safe-keeping, found their individual accounts drained 6–10% by the government, overnight. That would be impossible with digital currency like bitcoin, which makes it valuable for many who reside in parts of the world with deteriorating economies and/or currencies.\n\nBitcoin also provides an option for those living in countries whose currencies are restricted or not free floating (eg China, Russia), looking to get money out of the country.\n\nEven in the strongest economies the question of how stable certain fiat currencies really are is being tested. In a post-Great Recession world, governments of some of the leading economies decided to essentially print their way back to prosperity in one of the most massive economic experiments ever conducted: Quantitative Easing (QE).\n\nThe US led the way with QE in November 2008 with Ben Bernanke, then the head of the Federal Reserve, spearheading the experiment.\n\nAfter Lehman Brothers collapsed, as the economic debacle unfolded, developed-market central banks became fearful of deflation as opposed to inflation, an experience Japan had been dealing with since the early 1990s.\n\nDeflation is an insidious economic plague where citizens choose to hoard rather than to spend money, expecting lower prices for goods and services tomorrow relative to today.\n\nHowever, an economy can only improve when its citizens spend money. When companies have too few customers because the masses are scared to spend, employees are laid off in order to cut costs, and unemployment rises, reducing income streams and thus spending power.\n\nIt’s a vicious downward spiral, and Mr. Bernanke decided that the best way to stimulate the economy would be to increase inflation and lower unemployment, and he aimed to achieve this through massively increasing the money supply of the US dollar.\n\nThe US printed trillions of newly minted dollars over the six year period from 2008 to 2014 in an effort to stimulate the economy. The program worked to a degree, inflating asset prices per design due in part to the US dollar representing the world’s strongest economy as the global reserve currency.\n\nThe European Union (EU) has seen the success of QE in the US and has launched its own program to try to aid their unstable economy. The EU will print over 1 trillion new Euros by the time their version of QE is over.\n\nWhether QE works in the long run remains to be seen, but the fact is governments have the power to print as much of their own money as they want. If QE does not work and inflation becomes rampant, there are severe economic consequences as history has shown us.\n\nDigital gold\n\nLike gold, there is a finite supply of bitcoin.\n\nNo one can produce more gold than there is in the world, and similarly, no one can create more bitcoin. Bitcoin was modeled in several ways after gold: they are both scarce, they are both ""mined"" in order to add more into circulation, and it is impossible to artificially inflate supply.\n\nIn order to determine what gives bitcoin value, it first makes sense to analyze what gives gold value.\n\nGold has been in demand for thousands of years. It is rare, but not too rare so that it is impossible to obtain, and it is malleable so that it can be stamped for the purposes of coins. Its durability makes it reliable over time, as gold does not corrode, and its shiny and lustrous properties make it ideal for jewelry, its primary use.\n\nFor today’s purposes, gold is an efficient conductor of electricity, making it useful for electronics, though only in tiny amounts.\n\nGold, like anything else, has value primarily because humans have attached value to it over time. Any economic item is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Society, and now economies have placed value on the shiny metal, thus perpetuating its worth.\n\nIt does not provide food, shelter or clothing, but with enough gold one can purchase those items. When other currencies falter and stop working, societies have historically fallen back to a gold standard, which means gold also has some value as insurance against difficult times.\n\nBitcoin is a more transportable version of gold.\n\nSatoshi essentially took the properties of gold that make it valuable and programmed them into bitcoin, making bitcoin a more efficient and easier-to-use form of gold. Gold is heavy and non-divisible, meaning it is difficult to carry and impossible to spend in small amounts.\n\nYou can’t spend a piece of a gold coin in your possession.\n\nAs bitcoin is digital, it has no physical presence, only existing on the Internet, and it has the power of infinite divisibility. Bitcoin takes up no room in your wallet, safe, or vault, and currently it can be spent in any amount out to eight decimal points.\n\nThat means regardless of the price of 1 BTC, it can still be spent in whatever small amounts the user wants. This enables the ability to use bitcoin for tiny online transactions that have never before been feasible despite years of attempts.\n\nUsing bitcoin\n\nThis new use case deals with what are known as micropayments.\n\nMicropayments are financial transactions that involve very small sums of money (think pennies or fractions of pennies).\n\nBefore bitcoin, the smallest sized Internet transactions were not less than a few dollars, because it is not cost effective to run small payments through the existing credit/debit and banking systems. The fee structures of those systems makes them nonviable.\n\nHowever, with bitcoin, suddenly this becomes trivially easy.\n\nMicropayments can optimize content monetization, eliminating the need for banner ads and pop-ups, because Internet users can opt to pay as they go using arbitrarily small amounts of money to forgo ads when reading news articles or watching videos.\n\nMicropayments can also be used to fight spam. Future e-mail systems can refuse incoming messages unless they are accompanied by tiny amounts of bitcoin, tiny enough not to matter to the sender but large enough to prevent spammers, who these days can send billions of messages without limitation.\n\nBy attaching even a minor cost to spamming, that path of free advertising disappears. Public payments are another possibility that bitcoin makes possible.\n\nThere are examples of individuals holding up signs saying ""send me bitcoin!"" next to a QR code (a type of barcode). These codes can be seen in person, on TV, or in a photo, and sending Bitcoin is as easy as scanning a QR code using the camera feature of a phone.\n\nQR codes can contain the information of a public bitcoin wallet address, in which case all you then need to do is send your Bitcoin to the specified destination. In two clicks you can send a complete stranger money. This has implications for crowd-funding, protests and social movements, to name a few.\n\nAnyone can acquire and use bitcoin, and there are several ways to obtain it. The original method is through mining and winning the bitcoin reward; anyone with a computer can participate.\n\nFor everyone else, bitcoin exchanges offer users the ability to transfer fiat money from a credit card or bank account in exchange for bitcoin.\n\nFor the unbanked, bitcoin ATMs are also becoming more widespread, allowing users to exchange cash for bitcoin or bitcoin for cash, using the local fiat currency of whatever city the bitcoin ATM is located in. Bartering and exchanging bitcoin in peer-to-peer transactions is another easy way to obtain bitcoin.\n\nLastly, but more uncommon given the early stages of the bitcoin economy, you can find work where employees are paid in bitcoin.\n\nFrom a purely numbers perspective bitcoin has monetary value.\n\nGiven all the current use cases for the currency, the ubiquity of mobile phones, and the billions of people who are not yet part of the global financial system, bitcoin is an important asset class because it serves a purpose and provides solutions to existing problems.\n\nGold has value because it is scarce and there is demand for it.\n\nContrarily, the Zimbabwean Dollar does not have value because it is not scarce, despite domestic demand for it. Bitcoin is scarce, and because there is demand for it in many forms, it has value. There are currently 14.9, BTC in circulation and the price per Bitcoin is $455 at the time of writing. That yields a market capitalization of $6.8bn, in line with a mid-cap stock.\n\nUnfortunately but not surprisingly, some of the demand for Bitcoin comes from those operating outside of legal boundaries.\n\nMilton Friedman also predicted that the advent of digital currency ""has its negative side. It means that the gangsters, the people who are engaged in illegal transactions, will also have an easier way to carry on their business.""\n\nThe most well-documented example was the US government shut-down of Silk Road, an online drug bazaar that used Bitcoin to conduct transactions. However, one important and useful fact about how bitcoin works is that, much like e-mail which is traceable, bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous.\n\nEvery transaction in the bitcoin network is logged forever, permanently and immutably on the blockchain.\n\nAs this can and has helped law enforcement officials track down criminals, many governments around the world are not outlawing bitcoin, but instead are starting to enforce that bitcoin-related businesses have compliant Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies in place.\n\nOn that note, the singularly most used payment for illicit transactions are US $20, $50 and $100 bills.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin is beginning to be seen by the masses as a revolutionary technology. It rethinks the concept of money and eliminates the need for fee-taking middlemen when conducting transactions.\n\nThe current use case is broad, affecting the unbanked, the remittances market, online security, micropayments and public payments.\n\nThinking forward, the implications of this technology are vast and extend well beyond the use of Bitcoin as a currency.\n\nFor example, ""proof of existence"" is a concept that the immutability of the blockchain makes digitally possible. In the future people may not need to physically carry around wallets if government ID’s and passports are on the blockchain.\n\nIn November 2015, a couple notarized the birth of their daughter on the blockchain, attaching a hashed hospital birth certificate and video attestation from the parents and grandparents to a tiny bitcoin transaction. The result is a timestamped proof of the existence of their newborn on the blockchain, which can never be altered or disputed.\n\nThe ability to digitize notarizations is yet another possibility that the blockchain makes more efficient. There are thousands of bitcoin and blockchain-related startups around the world, with over $1bn of venture capital money invested in the space to date.\n\nIt is impossible to know what life-changing developments may result from this technology, similar to the way it wasn’t possible to predict the invention and impact of Twitter and Facebook when the internet was being developed in the early 1990s.\n\nBitcoin has only been around since 2009, and most people had not heard of it until it started to make front-page news in 2013.\n\nAs it develops into a more familiar technology, it is on track to become the first universal, Internet currency for the global citizen.\n\nThis piece originally appeared on Medium and has been republished here with the author\'s permission.\n\nFollow Jason on Twitter here.\n\nGlobal currency image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Photo: Janie Barrett\n\nThe Flux Party, which has gathered more than the 500 members it needs to stand senate candidates in all states, has designed a rival system underpinned by ""vote tokens"" that can be traded between party members and other participants – which could include rival minor parties.\n\nParty founder Max Kaye, a software developer who also works on Bitcoin, said: ""When a Flux candidate is elected they become a gateway for voters to directly influence parliament. Unlike other representatives, Flux candidates are not autonomous, and their votes in parliament are determined wholly by Flux participants.""\n\nFlux, which expects to be registered as a federal party by April, will begin by trying to revolutionise the much-maligned preference system.\n\nThe party will repay other minor parties that give their preferences to Flux by allocating a commensurate level of control over an elected Flux senator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMinor parties can then trade vote tokens with each other to ensure they have influence in parliament in their area of concern, Mr Kaye said.\n\nHe calls the system ""get-swap-vote"".\n\nFlux, which was previously known as the Neutral Voting Bloc, will have no specific policies when it stands candidates in each state.\n\nThe party\'s website states: ""The Australian Parliament is based on exclusion and exclusivity and does not equip us with the right tools to solve modern problems.\n\n""In order to solve problems that have never been solved before we need to try things that have never been tried before. Flux embodies this idea, and facilitates it.""\n\n""Flux, as a system, is a way to cooperate with fellow voters and distribute power in order to increase the amount of good legislation passed, and make passing bad legislation very expensive and difficult. The focus of Flux is not to be absolutely proportional, or give all voters an equal say on everything. Rather, Flux aims to solve particular problems by enabling those who are particularly well suited to solve that problem.\n\nFlux is sticking to some traditional methods of getting elected and will take part in Glenn Druery\'s minor party alliance to maximise preferences.\n\nMr Druery said he expects a number of minor parties to succeed in 2016, depending on any senate voting reform deal struck between the Greens and the Coalition, and believes Flux could be one of them.\n\n""They have certainly brought a refreshingly radical approach to the minor party scene but they may have to look at some old school ways if they want to first get elected,"" he said.', '', 'Over the last several months, a controversy has been brewing in the world of Bitcoin. The entire Bitcoin infrastructure has a fast approaching hard-coded limit, and as yet the Bitcoin community hasn’t reached a consensus on a solution.\n\nAs the number of Bitcoin transactions increase, this one megabyte ceiling on the block size is now leading to increasingly long transaction backlogs, as the miners (transaction processors) struggle to deal with the impending limit.\n\nThe obvious solution is simply to increase the block size limit – but such a change is easier said than done, because it requires a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol. (Less drastic soft fork options are also under consideration, but only serve to delay an eventual hard fork.)\n\nWith a hard fork, the revised protocol with the larger block size is essentially incompatible with the older, more limited protocol. As soon as enough miners have switched to the new protocol, then that one becomes the ‘official’ protocol, as those miners will no longer recognize Bitcoin transactions using the old protocol.\n\nNow that many of Bitcoin’s core developers have rejected Bitcoin XT – one promising hard fork option I covered in a previous article – the most likely contender for fixing the blockchain limit is now Bitcoin Classic. Bitcoin Classic eschews the more strategic (and complicated) approach of Bitcoin XT, instead favoring a simplistic doubling of the block size limit – a simple but short-sighted solution to the problem.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Bitcoin user, at some point their Bitcoin wallet software will simply stop working, and they’ll need to upgrade it to the latest version in order to resume Bitcoin transactions – a minor inconvenience, especially given how often and routinely we must all update the software we use.\n\nUpdating wallets, however, isn’t the issue. As a likely consensus on Bitcoin Classic approaches, some enterprising Bitcoiners have uncovered a potentially fatal flaw, not just with Bitcoin Classic, but with the hard fork process itself.\n\nAccording to a recent discussion in the Bitcoin Reddit forum, it’s possible to double your Bitcoins as miners switch from one protocol to the other. “We’ve never gone through a planned hard fork, so we don’t really know exactly how this will all play out,” warns Reddit commenter sgornick (in keeping with Bitcoin’s Libertarian values, most commenters are anonymous).\n\nThis double-your-money flaw depends upon tricking the system into thinking a particular amount of Bitcoin isn’t the same Bitcoin across the two incompatible transaction systems, a process insiders call tainting. “If you can borrow prior to the hard fork you can then taint those coins with newly mined ClassicCoin and use that to repay the loan,” sgornick continues. “The result is you’ll have satisfied repayment of the loan and you’d still end up with those pre-fork bitcoins you had borrowed.”\n\nOther Bitcoiners are sounding the warning as well – or perhaps alerting fellow schemers how to game the system. “Even a window of only minutes can and will be used by enterprising types to profit on the hard fork scenario,” explains Reddit commenter Vasyrr.\n\nRedditors are smart enough to realize, however, that this flaw in the system isn’t necessarily a license to print money. “If there are 5 forks, you will have coins valid on 5 chains, i.e. 5 times the amount of coins. If there are 100 forks, you will have coins valid on 100 chains, etc.,” says Reddit commenter braid_guy. “Whether they have any actual value in real life is another matter.”\n\nClearly, if too many people take advantage of this flaw, thus doubling their Bitcoin stake (or worse), then the value of all Bitcoin would promptly collapse – and given that there are about $5.7 billion of Bitcoin in circulation, such a collapse would be monumental. Perhaps some insiders are hoping only a very few will capitalize on the situation, themselves included.\n\nBut even if no one actually duplicates their Bitcoins this way, the mere fact that it’s possible to do so is potentially a fatal flaw for the entire Bitcoin system. To see why this statement is true, consider what would happen if there were a way to simply double the balance in an ordinary bank account via some kind of accounting error or hack.\n\nIn the modern banking system, such one-sided transactions are impossible because the entire banking system enforces double-entry accounting. In other words, if money appears in one place, then it must disappear somewhere else.\n\nOnly sovereign nations can print their own money, and if any nation were to do so without complying with the rules of the global banking system, then its currency would not be exchangeable for any other currency, and furthermore, it would be subject to runaway inflation.\n\nPlaced in this context, the ‘double your money’ hard fork flaw in the Bitcoin system potentially gives anyone the ability to ‘print their own money.’ And even though that potential may never actually be realized, simply the fact that it is possible should disqualify Bitcoin from being treated as a serious cybercurrency contender.\n\nDisagree with this article?

Pocopay is a mobile financial services provider targeting the European market, although the company is not like how your typical bank would be. By using QR codes and debit cards, Pocopay is not that different from the Bitcoin ecosystem on paper. However, the startup still relies on the legacy system, which could be its downfall in the long run.\n\nAlso read: Gavin Andresen Requests Feedback for His Version of BIP-102\n\nPocopay Brings Banking To Mobile Users in Europe\n\nThe financial world as we know it today will be undergoing several evolutionary steps in the years to come. Established financial players are struggling to bring any form of innovation to this industry, and the competition is heating up. Bitcoin, FinTech, and other financial startups are all looking to take the crown from banks in the near future.\n\nHowever, one thing most FinTech and other financial startups have in common is how they are not showing a high level of innovation either. Granted, a lot of these companies are looking into providing financial services without requiring users to own a bank account. Pocopay is one of those startups who aims to provide financial services but is a far cry from a fully licensed bank.\n\nThe business model for Pocopay is very straightforward: do not deal with deposits, and offer no loans to customers. In doing so, the startup is vastly different from banks as we know them, albeit the mobile service provider offers some interesting features. For example, customers will get access to a bank account and an NFC-enabled MasterCard debit card, in exchange for a flat fee of EUR 2,99 per month.\n\nThis bank account can be used by customers to manage their funds, as well as make transactions. All of the bank account activity can be monitored through the Pocopay mobile application, which is available to iOS and Android users. At the time of publication, there was no official word yet on whether or not other mobile operating systems will receive support in the future.\n\nWhat makes the service provided by Pocopay of particular interest is how users can make payments by scanning a QR code, an email address, or the recipient’s mobile phone number. Such a payment method draws several similarities with Bitcoin, a popular digital currency providing global financial infrastructure to mobile devices and computer owners.\n\nOne thing that holds back services like Pocopay is how they make use of the legacy system, and offer little to no innovation. In the end, this startup offers the same financial services banks offer right now, but as they do not handle customer funds directly, they will not be completely liable for any losses. Plus, this service is only available to select countries – The Netherlands, Estonia, and Spain – for the time being, which means it is not a global solution by any means.\n\nBitcoin is Global, Cheap, And Requires No Signup\n\nWhat the world needs is a global financial solution that doesn’t rely on the legacy system and banking infrastructure. None of the FinTech startups in existence seems to be looking at that option, albeit it is tough to come up with such a project. But no one is saying FinTech companies have to reinvent the wheel by any means, as a solution to this problem already exists in the form of Bitcoin.\n\nProviding an open financial network to anyone in the world is what has made Bitcoin so popular over the past few years. Even though some people might see it as a disadvantage to using a form of payment not backed by governments or banks, the existing monetary system is not doing too many people any favors either right now.\n\nBefore there was money in its current form, people around the world used to barter and the free market to determine the value of goods and services. Bitcoin offers that simple principle, as there is a fixed supply of coins, with a free market model where users dictate the price per BTC. Plus, no control by central entities removes most of the risk of fraud or corruption in the world of Bitcoin, which is something the traditional financial world will never be without.\n\nSource: Pocopay Blog', 'The world of finance is going nuts for blockchain, the technology first invented to underpin bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain uses decentralized record keeping and the scrutiny of the ""crowd"" to allow people to trade bitcoin over a public network without working through a trusted middle man like a bank or clearing house. Complex cryptography keeps the records from being tampered with once they\'re signed off on.\n\nBanks and other trading institutions think the technology has the potential to rip out huge amounts of cost from their businesses and are looking at ways it can be adopted to mainstream finance. 42 banks have signed up to an industry-wide consortium looking at use cases.\n\nChad Cascarilla is at the heart of the push to bring blockchain to Wall Street and the City. Cascarilla is the co-founder and CEO of itBit, the first bitcoin and blockchain company to be regulated by the New York State Department of Finance Services.\n\nBusiness Insider caught up with Cascarilla while he was in London this week to talk about what the company is doing, the potential of blockchain in financial services, and how the banks are approaching it.\n\nCascarilla shares that itBit are thinking about raising a new round of funding and says it hopes to roll out its signature Bankchain product to the precious metals market this year.\n\nRead the edited highlights of the chat below.\n\nBusiness Insider: How would you define blockchain? I\'m always interested to hear people describe it because everyone seems to have a slightly different take.\n\nChad Cascarilla: It’s just a database — that’s all it is. It’s easy to lose track of it amongst the buzzwords.\n\nBut it was a big innovation in databasing because it’s fully distributed. A normal database, someone’s actually running it. On the blockchain, nobody’s running it because everybody’s running it. From that perspective, that’s a real big shift. That’s actually hard to underestimate because normally you’ve got to pay someone to run a database for you.\n\nBI: What’s the itBit story — where are you guys coming from and where are you going?\n\nCC: My background is in financial services, I’ve spent my whole life doing that. About five, five and a half years ago when it was just at a nickel, we came across bitcoin. What was interesting to us was the underlying blockchain technology, which is the topic du jour now but certainly wasn’t back then.\n\nThe reason it was interesting to us is because we didn’t really know how succcessful bitcoin itself would be but we could tell that the concept of being able to create a distributed clearing and settlement network or a distributed payment network was a pretty big deal. Not from a computer scientist perspective per se, but from a financial services perspective.\n\nOur view has been that we want to take blockchains and apply them to financial services problems. When we started itBit three years ago, moving things over the blockchain — ownership of real assets — was to us the really exciting concept. Not that you can’t use it for other things — you can put land titles, copyrights, patents, you name it. You can put anything on a blockchain to move around in a common way. But you’ve got to start somewhere.\n\nWhat became clear to us was you really needed some kind of regulatory structure because if you’re moving regulated assets it’s hard to do that without a regulated entity.\n\nHow can you create the on ramps and off ramps? You can do that by partnering with financial services firms — that’s helpful — but the more partners you need the slower development cycles happen. We created a trust company and about a year ago now we were approved.\n\nBI: You guys were one of the first to get a license weren’t you?\n\nCC: Yeah. We were the first trust company [in bitcoin]. There’s been one other created. I don’t think there’s anyone else who’s going to go down this route because we basically became a bank.\n\nThe concept was marry a bank with technology and then you can start doing some really innovative things with financial services. It’s hard to do truly innovative things with technology in existing banks because they have such complex systems.\n\nBI: Especially at the moment when banks seem to be struggling to keep their head above water with existing regulation, let alone taking on any new technology.\n\nCC: I think that’s exactly right.\n\nLook at financial services: you have a trading layer where exchanges are — huge amounts of innovation have happened there. Then you have the layers below that — clearing and settlement, custody, depository.\n\nEverything after the trading layer is sitting here run on mainframe computers programmed in the 1970s and 1980s — literally in COBAL [a mainframe programming language]. It’s a dead language. One of the biggest banks in the world only has five or six developers left who actually know how to programme these things.\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest banks in the world only has 5 or 6 developers left who actually know how to programme these things.\n\nBI: Who’s that?\n\nCC: I can’t say. But they’re all like that. They’re literally down to their last five or 10 developers.\n\nIn the late 1990s, that’s how trading was done too — on COBAL mainframes. But that was hugely innovated on.\n\nBut you haven’t had a reason to innovate on post-trade layers because everyone just thinks of those as costs. ""Oh bookkeeping, that’s a cost, we’ll just throw some bodies at it.""\n\nDepending on the asset, people are still using excel spreadsheets, emails, PDFs to basically reconcile what’s going on in the back office. It’s still very much a bodies business. I would describe it as they’ve just digitised a paper process. They didn’t reimagine it.\n\nIf you think about internet 1.0, it’s kind of a digitisation of paper. But then you think about internet 2.0 — whether it be apps on your mobile or whatever — and it\'s totally, drastically changing the way we interact with information. That’s what needs to happen in the back offices of financial services.\n\nThat hasn’t happened because the switching costs are so unbelievably high because you’re regulated, you can’t innovate, and, frankly, the old systems work.\n\nBut now that capital charges are going up I think you’re getting into a different position.\n\nBI: It seems from the industry perspective there’s also a bit of a herd mentality with blockchain that’s acting in its favour. Once one bank moves, all the others want to be involved too. How long have you been trying to pitch this to the banks?\n\nCC: It’s a very long sales cycle. I probably started talking to them about this about February, March last year. It’s been a year. But the reason it’s a long sales cycle is these are big organisations — you’re working across groups and the technology is new.\n\nI think the banks know that there’s a couple of things going on: you’re hitting the end of the usual life of these mainframe computers, at the same time that capital charges are going up, and revenues aren’t growing.\n\nThey need to figure out a way to cut costs that is innovative. They’re really taking a holistic look and saying: ""OK, what are we doing here? Do we want the best version of yesterday’s technology?"" They’re really trying to be thoughtful about it, some more than others.\n\nBI: And your main product is Bankchain, is that right?\n\nCC: Correct. When we say we’ve been pitching the bank for a year, we’re now at the point where we have partnerships that are underway, proof of concepts, implementations that are getting underway. We’ve got to the point where the rubber hits the road. Bankchain is our product that we’ve built to address financial services needs.\n\nBI: Is it tailored to specific products?\n\nCC: The core technology can work on anything — use case agnostic. That’s not surprising, in some ways that’s good engineering. [But] then you need to go out and say here’s a good use case. That’s what has the front end that’s tailored to precious metals or syndicated loans or equities settlement.\n\nIt’s complex to build the front end and the data layer hooking into the core databasing technology. Then you have to hook it into the current system of the people you’re working with.\n\nBI: Is there any particular use cause that’s more popular than others?\n\nCC: Post-trade is pretty huge. Oliver Wyman said it’s like an $80-85 billion market. That’s about a third of capital market revenues. So of all capital markets, about a third is sitting in post-trade — it’s enormous.\n\nIt’s hard to say people want to address just one specific area because they’ve got to address this whole thing. But you’ve got to drill down — if you want to try and fix syndicated loans with blockchain, you could be doing that for years.\n\nIf I think of the use cases that I know firms are working on it’s everything from cross-border payments to OTC derivatives to syndicated loans to equities to repo to precious metals to trade finance. Those are just some of them.\n\nBI: How many banks and financial services firms are you in talks with?\n\nCC: About a dozen. We have three use cases we’re focusing on and within those we have different partners. In capital markets, there are 25, maybe 50 at most, institutions that matter in the world — repositories, exchanges, buy side firms, sell side like the banks. Depending on what you’re trying to solve, you need to partner with these people.\n\nBI: Does this technology need a critical mass to go mainstream? Obviously, the point of this is it’s distributed and you need multiple parties for that.\n\nCC: No one wants to show up at the club and nobody else is there. There’s two ways you combat that.\n\n\n\nNo one wants to show up at the club and nobody else is there.\n\nThe first is you create a system that’s fully interoperable with today’s world. Because we’re a trust company we have our own SWIFT code, we have access to all the infrastructure, we have a whole variety of ways to interact with the world as it is now.\n\nWe have a way to move people incrementally to tomorrow — you can’t just get to a future state. You have to make it so that if you’re on [the Bankchain] you can interact with everyone who’s off and you have to make it relatively easy to do.\n\nSecondly, you have to make sure that you go out and make sure that people are invested in this product, meaning they’re helping you build it, you’re getting ideas from them, it’s solving their needs. You can’t just create something that you think someone wants.\n\nBI: How do you see initiatives like industry-wide blockchain consortium R3 — do you see it has competition? Or is it such a big market that there\'s room for both of you? Is it good that things like R3 are raising awareness?\n\nCC: Probably all of those. It’s good that there are 42 banks or whatever it ends up being that feel they need to be part of this technology. If you went out and said \'Hey I’ve got a new database lets build a consortium,\' how many people do you think would apply? You say blockchain and suddenly you’ve got 42 banks paying and there’s going to be more. That’s great, that’s a really good sign for the industry.\n\nI don’t know if anyone knows how R3’s strategy is going to evolve, it’s already evolved a lot from where they started. That’s not a surprise, that’s just the nature of new technologies and new groups.\n\nLike I said, post-trade is a huge world. Some of the use cases the banks will be looking at will have no overlap with what we’re doing. It certainly seems that way so far.\n\nBI: How are you guys funded?\n\nCC: We’ve raised $32.5 million (£22.3 million) so far and it’s basically come from a combination of VCs and the management team. We’re going to obviously expand our funding base.\n\nBI: Imminently?\n\nCC: I’d say it’s something we’re spending a lot of time on because we want to grow the company and expand the use cases that we’re addressing. Digital Asset raised a round, others raised rounds — you need funding to be able to develop this kind of cutting edge software.\n\nBI: And strike while the iron\'s hot.\n\nCC: Yeah. You’ve got to be careful how you couch this stuff but yes we’re spending a lot of time thinking about this stuff.\n\nBI: How long do you see industry adoption of blockchain taking?\n\nCC: Again it gets down to use cases but lets just say people start doing proof of concepts and maybe even start having it rolled out in certain markets this year. I think you could see limited roll-out, we certainly hope to be rolling out in the precious metals market this year.\n\nBut I think realistically, this is a big upgrade cycle. It’s going to take a decade or more. If you’ve done 50 acquisitions as a bank, your capacity to just pull all those systems out and have confidence that it will all be ok — that’s really playing with fire.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""James Pickford FEBRUARY 7, 2016 8 Lord Jeffrey Archer, the millionaire author, former MP and convicted perjurer, has trimmed his tax bill by donating a statue of Satan to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. The 80cm-tall bronze sculpture, which has been on loan to the museum since 2010, was made by French artist Jean-Jacques Feuchère in the 1830s and shows a downcast winged figure lost in melancholy. Regarded as a precursor to Auguste Rodin’s The Thinker, Satan/Mephistopheles will be the centrepiece of the Ashmolean’s new 19th- century gallery, due to open in the spring. Lord Archer made the donation through the Cultural Gifts Scheme, a tax break launched by the government in 2013. This allows living donors to give a significant work to the nation — and express their wish about its final home — while reducing their income tax or capital gains tax liabilities by up to 30 per cent of the object’s value. Owners can typically make more by selling the work on the open market, but the tax incentive allows them to improve the collections of favoured museums or galleries, which pay nothing. The horned bronze figure produced a tax reduction of £48,000, the scheme’s annual report said. This compares with the former Conservative party chairman’s total worth of £140m, as estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List. Alexander Sturgis, Ashmolean director, said the Cultural Gift Scheme — and the older Acceptance in Lieu scheme, which takes donations in lieu of inheritance tax, were “unbelievably valuable” to the museum. “What they allow us to do is acquire work that simply would be beyond our reach. The way in which our collection has grown in recent years is in large part down to these schemes.” JMW Turner’s 'The High Street, Oxford' (1810) The Acceptance in Lieu scheme last year provided the museum with its first finished picture by John Constable, The Valley Farm (1835), and JMW Turner’s The High Street, Oxford (1810). The cultural gifts scheme has had a slow start, with one work given in its first year, four in the second and six last year. But the criteria for qualification are high: works must be of “pre-eminent” national, scientific, historic or artistic interest, as judged by a panel of experts convened by Arts Council England. Feuchère’s gift was recognised in his lifetime: he was responsible for one of the panels on the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Élysées. When it was first exhibited in 1834 at the Paris Salon, his demonic statue was highly praised as “a personification, with plenty of verve and ardour, of the evil genius at odds with being powerless”. The Ashmolean said it was “profoundly grateful” for the donation, the first Lord Archer has made to any museum. A spokesman for the peer said he planned to leave works in his will to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Ashmolean, Tate and the National Museum in Canberra. Infernal themes have appeared before in Lord Archer’s cultural orbit: convicted of perjury in 2000 and sentenced to four years in prison, he adapted diaries of his time behind bars into three books, named, after Dante’s Divine Comedy, Hell, Purgatory and Heaven.

The announcement comes nearly two years after the organization began a Trigger the Move campaign, which sought to get 20,000 people to move to the community.\n\n""Today, we announce that the Free State Project has officially Triggered the Move, and that participants now have five years from February 3, 2016 to move to New Hampshire to help build the world\'s first intentional liberty community,"" said Free State Project president Carla Gericke during a speech to commemorate the occasion. ""I don\'t mean \'intentional community\' like kibbutz or commune, but a statewide community bound by the principles of liberty, which can neatly be summarized as a \'live and let live\' mentality.""\n\nAccording to Gericke, the 20,000 signatories mark was reached two years earlier than anticipated and over 2,000 people have already moved to New Hampshire (referred to simply as ""the shire"" by the group), purchasing upwards of $30 million in real estate. The group has chosen New Hampshire for a number of reasons, although chief among them is that the group is able to ""maximize [its] odds of success"" because of ""the easy access to politics."" (New Hampshire has the largest state legislature in the US at 400 persons.)\n\nIn the 13 years since its founding, the group has made large strides toward establishing its libertarian utopia. This is most noticeable in the group\'s widespread adoption of Bitcoin, which has earned the state the unofficial moniker of ""Bitcoin Capital of America."" Self-identified Free Staters in New Hampshire launched Lamassu, one of the most popular Bitcoin ATMs, in 2013. SatoshiDice, the Bitcoin gambling website, was also launched out of New Hampshire in 2012 by Bitcoin mogul and Free Stater Erik Vorhees.\n\nAlthough both of these Bitcoin businesses have been forced out of the US by various regulatory agencies, the Free State Project hopes to garner enough influence in New Hampshire politics to make the state more friendly to liberty-minded businesses. They seem to be well on their way to this goal, with 16 Free State Project members now serving in the state\'s House of Representatives.\n\n""Only 3,000 to 4,000 movers would be enough of an activist base to match anything that any of the other ideological factions in the state can muster, maybe even all of them put together,"" said Jason Sorens, a professor of government at Dartmouth College and the founder of the Free State Project. ""20,000 movers could turn New Hampshire into the Switzerland of North America.""\n\n""First New Hampshire, then the world!""\n\n\n\nThe group has attracted the attention of high profile politicians and activists, including Edward Snowden who is scheduled for a live video conference at the group\'s Liberty Forum to be held later this month. Unsurprisingly, not everyone in New Hampshire is happy with the Free Stater\'s plans to turn the state into a libertarian utopia.\n\n""Free Staters are the single biggest threat the state is facing today,"" Cynthia Chase, a Democrat currently serving in New Hampshire\'s House of Representatives, commented in a forum. ""There is, legally, nothing we can do to prevent them from moving here to take over the state, which is their openly stated goal... What we can do is to make the environment here so unwelcoming that some will choose not to come, and some may actually leave. One way is to pass measures that will restrict the \'freedoms\' that they think they will find here.""\n\nIt remains to be seen how the Free Stater\'s planned exodus will pan out, although Gericke and her colleagues feel as though reaching the 20,000 signatories mark bodes well for the community\'s future.\n\n""Look, the Free State Project is not everyone\'s cup of tea…but a large number of people are dissatisfied with the direction this country is heading,"" Gericke said. ""In 10 to 20 years I know New Hampshire will stand as a wealthy, prosperous, autonomous example—a beacon of liberty—for the rest of the world to emulate. The future for the Free State Project in New Hampshire looks bright. First New Hampshire, then the world!""']"
02/08/2016,"[""As we see all the time, even when the problem is real, the original product designed to solve can fail for reasons that may be technical, financial, social or competitive. But parts of it live on, in mutated or expanded forms.\n\nSo it is with Bitcoin. Even if it fails, the idea of the distributed ledger underpinning it is gaining momentum and transforming as it does.\n\nVarious consortia of financial institutions, technology companies, statutory bodies and governments are exploring how this process, essentially a decentralisation of the 'trust' sustaining the financial system, can be utilised to driver lower costs and efficiencies.\n\nFor example, this bank, ANZ, is one of the founding participants in the Open Ledger project, an initiative seeking to develop an enterprise-grade framework for blockchain that supports multiple players in multiple industries.\n\nThe collaboration will concentrate on a cross-industry open standard for distributed ledgers, including for banking and brings together Cisco, Deutsche Börse, Digital Asset Holdings, IBM, Intel, J.P. Morgan, London Stock Exchange Group, R3, SWIFT, and Wells Fargo.\n\nOther ventures, such as R3, one of the Open Ledger members, are also consortia but are seeking particular commercial outcomes.\n\nOne of the standards to which such ventures can usefully contribute is definitions. When reading about blockchains and distributed ledgers – which can be public (like for Bitcoin) or private (like for the commercial markets like the ASX) – there's considerable ambiguity.\n\nChris Skinner's Blog, a very readable curation of what's going on, quoted Professor Michael Mainelli, Chairman of Z/Yen Group, on the terminology.\n\n“What is, and what isn't, a 'blockchain'?” Mainelli asks.\n\n“The Bitcoin cryptocurrency uses a data structure that I have often termed as part of a class of 'mutual distributed ledgers'. Let me set out the terms as I understand them:\n\nledger – a record of transactions\n\ndistributed – divided among several or many, in multiple locations\n\nmutual – shared in common, or owned by a community\n\nmutual distributed ledger (MDL) – a record of transactions shared in common and stored in multiple locations\n\nmutual distributed ledger technology – a technology that provides an immutable record of transactions shared in common and stored in multiple locations.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSkinner adds: “Interestingly, the 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto paper that preceded the 1 January 2009 launch of the Bitcoin protocol does not use the term 'blockchain' or 'block chain'. It does refer to 'blocks'. It does refer to 'chains'. It does refer to 'blocks' being 'chained' and also a 'proof-of-work chain'.\n\n“The paper's conclusion echoes a MDL – “we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power.” [Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, bitcoin.org (2008)]”\n\nThis is not just a question of semantics or even semiology, what we are seeing play out in the market place is the dismemberment of parts of the chain.\n\nFew major institutions any more are actively interested in Bitcoin. Of the bits of Bitcoin, they're particularly not interested in its ungoverned governance structure, its lack of transparency – one of the things which potentially cut transaction costs for Bitcoin was the lack of the very audit trails regulation requires to prevent money laundering and sanction breaking – and its “commodity” nature which makes it fraught as a store of value.\n\nWhat is useful though is the ledger system. This is where banks are looking to develop usage cases.\n\nFor example, in the clearing and settling processes necessary for payments and stock exchanges, the central, trusted entity solves the problem of buyers and sellers exchanging goods and payments without knowing one another.\n\nHowever, there are costs in the system. Having a distributed ledger theoretically allows the process to happen faster with fewer parties involved. Banks also have to hold reserves to cover various contingencies, such as overnight cash holdings, but it's an imprecise system which too could be more efficient.\n\nSo what we have seen in the seemingly Icarus-like flight of Bitcoin is what we are undoubtedly going to see much more often in the fintech space; to maintain a somewhat mixed flight metaphor, even though the Pterodactyl didn't survive evolution, flight did.\n\nFintech is already fragmenting and expanding as some smart technologies fail to gain traction or market scale and are absorbed by others, clever ideas are appropriated, incumbents partner or buy or learn from genuine transformations.\n\nWhile the initial flurry in fintech was with ideas potentially massively disruptive, like payments or peer-to-peer lending, we are now starting to see the emergence of much more specialised adaptations – such as “regtech”.\n\nRegtech is the sector devoted to developing smart technology approaches to the growing regulatory obligations in myriad institutions with the intention of not just cutting costs but providing a competitive advantage for those who can do compliance better.\n\nAnd distributed ledgers will play a role in that sector too. Bitcoin won't.\n\nAndrew Cornell is manging editor at BlueNotes"", 'This post is by Benjamin Roussey\n\nThe first fundraising in the world for an initial public offering of a Bitcoin mining company has raised 5.9 million Australian dollars, (USD $4.2 million) – falling short of its target of AUD $20 million.\n\nBased in Melbourne, the Bitcoin Group announced last week that it had raised AUD $5,927,168.40 in a bookbuild of its Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listing. The company also announced that it was still progressing though the listing process with ASX.\n\nEven though the amount raised was less than a third of the amount it tried for, CEO of Bitcoin Group Sam Lee called it a “solid result.”\n\nDuring an interview on CNBC on Tuesday, Lee said the amount raised is sufficient for the company to execute its current strategy of acquiring new mining equipment to expand its footprint.\n\nAlthough it was scheduled to take place on Tuesday, Bitcoin Group has not yet announced its quote on the ASX. It is expected that the company will trade under the ticker BCG.\n\nThe price of shares was at AUD $0.20, with AUD $2,000 as the minimum subscription. There is no maximum subscription. According to the Australian Taxation Office, Bitcoin is an asset for capital gains tax purposes.\n\nThis is the first time a publicly listed entity has been led by the Bitcoin Group Management since its incorporation in September 2014. Lee, the CEO, has a background in financial services and digital media.\n\nOn CNBC, Nicolas Debock, a venture capitalist at Balderton Capital in London, said he would need to think twice before investing in a Bitcoin mining firm, as it has a number of risks. He added that many venture capitalists have invested in Bitcoin in the last three years, but there still has been no money coming out.\n\nBitcoin Group produces approximately 1.2 percent of the world’s Bitcoin mining output, with six mining sites in Iceland and China. Due to the affordability of electric supply in China, a large percentage of its operations are conducted in China. However, since it is significantly lacking in diversification, the company could be left vulnerable to changes in regulations resulting from the Chinese stance on Bitcoin.\n\nIf the company had raised the AUD $20 million it had hoped for, the plan was to use AUD $18 million as an investment in equipment and facilities for Bitcoin mining. The remaining AUD $2 million was to be used for general corporate purposes, including costs for listing.\n\nOn CNBC, Debock said that a large number of people still believe in Bitcoin in the long term, whether it is the technology or the asset.', 'One could even go as far as saying how Bitcoin is more halal under the laws of Islam than paper currency will ever be.\n\nBitcoin can do a world of good all over the globe, and the technology powering the network offers a ton of potential. But not everyone is looking for a solution in the financial sector or any other industry where blockchain technology might play a significant role. Furthermore, there is the topic of religion, which begs the question whether or not Bitcoin can be in conflict with one’s beliefs. For example, is the involvement in Bitcoin halal under the laws of Islam, and is there an intrinsic value to the popular digital currency?\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Micropayments Make A Lot of Sense For The Brave Browser\n\nCurrency And The Islam\n\nCurrency is a strange concept, as it is very hard to define what makes a particular medium of transferring value legal or not. Before money in its current form was created, people used barter to complete transactions, with the value of goods changing on a regular basis. But there is also the religious concept to take into account, as every belief has their own “standards” regarding money and currency.\n\nEspecially when it comes to exchanging one type of currency for another, things are not as clear under the laws of Islam. In the Western world, people take this type of business for granted and rarely give it a second, though. But certain religions are quite strict on currency exchange, begging the question what the stance of the Islam is.\n\nBased on the answer provided by Islam Today, it looks like the exchange of currency is a permissible form of business. However, both parties have to receive the money for this transaction by hand, and delays are not permitted. While these rules were created for precious metals, the same principles apply to other forms of currency.\n\nIs Bitcoin Halal or Not?\n\nWhen reading that question out loud for the first time, some people might shake their heads and laugh out loud. But this topic is no matter of jokes and humour, as it is a very serious question posted on Stackexchange not that long ago. The concept of digital currency might contradict certain religions or beliefs.\n\nOne follower of the Islamic faith posted the question on Stackexchange, as there was some confusion whether or not involvement in Bitcoin could be halal. Keeping in mind how digital currency is vastly different from money owned and controlled by banks and governments, the question only seems logical, and there was no definitive answer at that time.\n\nThe best answer given on Stackexchange mentioned how Bitcoin can be seen as a medium similar to precious metals. One of the main issues people have with the concept of digital currency is how there is no physical representation of Bitcoin, albeit it can be proven to exist when needed. Not in a tangible form, but one can complete a transaction in Bitcoin and prove it has a value to other people.\n\nHowever, when it comes to Bitcoin’s intrinsic value – or potential lack thereof – things are quite different. The laws of Islam require halal currency to have intrinsic value, and digital currency seems to fit that bill perfectly. Unlike fiat currency, which is represented by a paper medium susceptible to damage, loss, and theft, Bitcoin has intrinsic value as its worth can not be tampered with through duplication and other illegal means.\n\nExpressing that intrinsic value is vastly different from how most people would look to describe Bitcoin. As most people are well aware, the modern digital currency is generated through a process called “mining”, which requires computation power in the form of proof-of-work. This is exactly what gives Bitcoin its intrinsic value under the laws of Islam, as the value is proportional to the difficulty required for mining.\n\nAdditionally, halal currency should be deflationary in nature, which leads to fluctuation in value. The Bitcoin value has gone up over the course of the past seven years, albeit there have been several stumbles along the way. Gold is halal as well, as there is a limit supply available and the prices are anything but stable. One could even go as far as saying how Bitcoin is more halal under the laws of Islam than paper currency will ever be.\n\nSource: Stackexchange', 'E-Coin card users can now send bitcoin and instantly load their cards rather than having to wait for three confirmations, thanks to BitGo Instant, which provides immediate settlement of bitcoin transactions.

Users have complete control and can opt in to provide others with their view key at their discretion.”\n\nThe currency’s creators first proposed the underlying concept in a 2014 academic paper by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University and Israel’s Technion and Tel Aviv University.\n\nThe Zcash team hopes to have a live version of the currency available in July, founder and CEO Zooko Wilcox said in a cryptocurrency forum AMA session last week. In the meantime, potential users and developers can experiment with the alpha version of the currency and its underlying open source software on a “testnet” network, though its creators emphasize that the test version of the currency has no value and holdings can be reset at any time until the actual network’s launch.\n\nThe added privacy could make Zcash a more viable choice for financial institutions and consumers than other cryptocurrencies, Wilcox wrote in a January blog post.\n\nOther alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, have sought to distinguish themselves by offering enhanced anonymity compared to bitcoin. A number of currencies based on the CryptoNote protocol support so-called ring signatures, intended to make it mathematically impossible to see which of a group, or ring, of users generated a particular transaction. Another currency, called Dash, aims to anonymize spending by bundling together unrelated transactions, so that observers can’t tell which of the transaction parties are sending money to each other.', 'This article is an op-ed by Andrew DeSantis and the views expressed are those of the author.\n\nOn January 9th, 2007 the world as we know know it was forever changed. Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs, took the stage at the Moscone Center in San Francisco and introduced the world to the iPhone.\n\nNine years later, many have trouble remembering what life was like before the rise of mobile. The average smartphone today is more than one million times smaller, one million times more affordable and one thousand times more powerful than a $60 million supercomputer was 40 years ago. As a result of successive radical innovation, we have truly changed the world, but more importantly the world has forever changed us.\n\nIn 1998, when asked what keeps him up at night, Bill Gates had a surprising answer. As the CEO of Microsoft, one might have expected him to say Apple, Oracle, or even Netscape. Instead he stated: “I worry about someone in a garage inventing something that I haven’t thought of.” Unbeknownst to Gates, at that very moment Larry Page and Sergey Brin were hard at work in a garage in Menlo Park. The fruit of their labor would go on to become Google.\n\nGates, like many of us, has accepted that change, particularly technological change, is one of the few constants in life and even the smartest among us can be caught be caught by surprise.\n\nOn January 3rd, 2009, less than two years after Jobs unveiled the iPhone, Satoshi Nakamoto sent an email to the renowned “Cryptography Mailing List” titled “Bitcoin v0.1 released.” The email contained a SourceForge link to the first bitcoin reference client and the following statement:\n\n“Announcing the first release of Bitcoin, a new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double spending. It’s completely decentralized with no server of central authority”\n\nNakamoto then went on to give a brief summary of Bitcoin’s implementation and explicitly add a disclaimer stating that the included software was still alpha and experimental.\n\nWhen Jobs introduced the iPhone he had the attention of the entire tech world. Everyone knew the device would be a game changer, but no one could have predicted that five years later the iPhone would catalyze the creation of a ride hailing application called Uber. Today Uber has an estimated worth of $62.5 billion, higher than that of car markets GM, Ford and Honda, and could very well go on to become the world’s first trillion-dollar company.\n\nNakamoto’s announcement on the other hand went relatively unnoticed by the public, but a handful of dreamers immediately realized the ramifications of Satoshi’s vision. The first to respond to Nakamoto’s email was cypherpunk legend Hal Finney. Three days later on January 12, Nakamoto executed the first Bitcoin transaction, in block 170, sending 50 bitcoins to Finney.\n\nIn May of 2010 roughly a year and a half after Bitcoin’s genesis block was mined by Nakamoto, two members of the BitcoinTalk community forum executed the first real-world purchase. 10,000 BTC for a $25 pizza. Five and a half years have since passed and with a near six-billion dollar market capitalization it is safe to say that Bitcoin come a long way, but there is still a ways to go.\n\nBitcoin Today\n\nSince 2013 the Bitcoin industry has somewhat operated in stealth mode. Companies like 21 Inc, BitGo and Blockstream have been hard at work in collaboration with the Bitcoin Core developers to ready Bitcoin for the next and brightest stage of its life thus far. In the words of software legend Joel Spolsky, “Good software takes 10 years. Get used to it.”\n\n21 Inc’s CEO, Dr. Balaji S. Srinivasan stated the following in a lecture at Stanford University prior to founding 21:\n\n“A good founder is capable of anticipating which turns lead to treasure and which lead to certain death. A bad founder is just running to the entrance of (say) the ‘movies/music/filesharing/P2P’ maze or the ‘photo sharing’ maze without any sense for the history of the industry, the players in the maze, the casualties of the past, and the technologies that are likely to move walls and changes assumptions.”\n\nSo what about Bitcoin is likely to “move walls” and “change assumption?” While user-monetizable data is of significant importance to Bitcoin’s future, the concept of “user-monetizable actions” is of far greater importance.\n\nThe DARPA Network Challenge\n\nAt 10 a.m. EST on December 5th, 2009 (this date was picked to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Internet) the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), known for creating the ARPANET, a precursor to the Internet and contributing to the onion protocol used by the Tor network, launched 10 red balloons in undisclosed locations across the continental United States. A month earlier DARPA proposed an open challenge to teams across the nation. The first team to locate all 10 balloons and report their findings to DARPA would receive a $40,000 reward. What happened next exceeded the researchers wildest expectations.\n\nLess than nine hours after DARPA launched the balloons a team from MIT won the competition. How did they do it? By embracing the concept of user-monetizable actions.\n\nIn 2005, Jon Kleinberg of the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University and Prabhakar Raghaven of Yahoo! Research published a paper titled “Query Incentive Networks.” In it they write:\n\n“The concurrent growth of online communities exhibiting large-scale social structure, and of large decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing systems, has stimulated new interest in understanding networks of interacting agents as economic systems. Here we formulate a model for query incentive networks, motivated by such systems: users seeking information or services can pose queries, together with incentives for answering them, that are propagated along paths in a network. This type of information-seeking process can be formulated as a game among the nodes in the network, and this game has a natural Nash equilibrium. In such systems, it is a fundamental question to understand how much incentive is needed in order for a node to achieve a reasonable probability of obtaining an answer to a query from the network.”\n\nBuilding off the ideas presented in Kleinburg and Raghavan’s research, the team from MIT came up with the following strategy:\n\n“We’re giving $2000 per balloon to the first person to send us the correct coordinates, but that\'s not all -- we\'re also giving $1000 to the person who invited them. Then we’re giving $500 whoever invited the inviter, and $250 to whoever invited them, and so on.\n\n""It might play out like this. Alice joins the team, and we give her an invite link like http://balloon.media.mit.edu/alice. Alice then e-mails her link to Bob, who uses it to join the team as well. We make a http://balloon.media.mit.edu/bob link for Bob, who posts it to Facebook. His friend Carol sees it, signs up, then twitters about http://balloon.media.mit.edu/carol. Dave uses Carol’s link to join … then spots one of the DARPA balloons! Dave is the first person to report the balloon’s location to us, and the MIT Red Balloon Challenge Team is the first to find all 10. Once that happens, we send Dave $2000 for finding the balloon. Carol gets $1000 for inviting Dave, Bob gets $500 for inviting Carol, and Alice gets $250 for inviting Bob. The remaining $250 is donated to charity.”\n\nIn essence the MIT team designed a recursive algorithm executed by willing participants by redistributing the prize money to the participants in such a way that a power incentive structure came to life.\n\nWhile the MIT team’s accomplishment is significant, particularly from the perspective of academia, it wasn’t the only major insight derived from the DARPA Network Challenge. Hacker George Hotz, known as geohot, in 2007 was the first person to carrier-unlock an iPhone. Hotz later went on to jailbreak Sony’s PlayStation 3. Hotz recently made headlines when he and a writer from Bloomberg Businessweek took a drive around the San Francisco Bay area in a self-driving car he built alone in just a month. An hour prior to the start of the DARPA Network Challenge, Hotz tweeted to his then roughly 50,000 followers asking for their assistance in locating the balloons. Through his network Hotz located four ballons, he was then able to trade information with other teams ultimately bringing his balloon count to eight.\n\nThe approach taken by the MIT team displays the raw power that a properly designed algorithm can have outside as well as inside the confines of Silicon. Hotz’s approach, on the other hand, allows us to contrast the academic perspective with that of a single hacker wielding influence over a network of individuals.\n\nIf one combines the two approaches, by using Bitcoin to send microtransactions to their own network of followers, what you end up with is a variant of Kleinberg and Raghavan’s Query Incentive Network model that allows one to execute MapReduce-like operations over a large network of willing participants.\n\nEnd-User Monetization\n\nWe can change our perspective, yet again, and view things through the eyes of an end user performing tasks on behalf of another individual. While this sounds like a new concept it really isn’t. Celebrities have monetized their actions on Twitter and Facebook for years. The musician Jared Leto and socialite Kim Kardashian have reportedly received payments as high as $13,000 per tweet for promoting products that fall in line with their personal brand.\n\nUntil now, it hasn’t financially made sense for a user with a few thousand followers to receive payments for endorsements. Additionally, most celebrities tend to rely on agents who cut deals with sponsors on their behalf. Even if the average user put in the effort to build a network of sponsors, it is highly unlikely that a sponsor would want to deal with a user who’s follower count is below 100,000. As with most scenarios that rely on the ability to perform microtransactions, the pre-bitcoin banking system isn’t designed to handle small, fast, and international transactions.\n\nEarlier this week Srinivasan presented his thoughts on the future of user-monetizable actions. After presenting scenarios such as the Twitter covered above and derivatives such as a Bitcoin-based, decentralized version of Fiverr, he left two questions to ponder:\n\nWhat would life be like if even while you were asleep an autonomous agent handled requests that earned Bitcoin on your behalf?\n\nWhat would you do with your own personal army of willing, waiting, able and ready individuals?\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Bitcoin Engineering class at Stanford University has gone tremendously well. Likely because a majority of the students enrolled in the course have little to no previous knowledge about Bitcoin, they will be able to leverage the abstractions provided by the 21 Bitcoin Computer’s two1 Python3 library and quickly rhapsodize applications into existence without the burden of knowledge (fatigue) many of us have accumulated over the years.\n\nA computer science student named Axel Ericsson hacked together his own tunneling protocol allowing him to securely communicate with his 21 Bitcoin Computer from a web browser. While a future release of the two1 library will likely support browser-to-machine BitTransfers triggered by 402 requests, today the 21 Bitcoin Computer is being used for machine-to-machine transactions. Most likely, Axel executed one of the world’s first 402 request transactions initiated from a web browser in exchange for user-monetizable data.', 'Long before Alec Ross logged half a million miles visiting 41 countries as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s senior adviser for innovation, he found himself in a concert hall in Charleston, West Virginia, swabbing up puke after a country music concert.\n\nRoss was 19 and had just finished his freshman year of college at Northwestern University. While some of his classmates were working fancy internships at law firms and congressional offices, he pushed a mop on the midnight shift as a member of the Charleston Civic Center’s janitorial crew.\n\nThe summer job would provide a memorable view from the wrong side of the new economy, working alongside guys who, a generation ago, might have found employment in a coal mine (but those jobs had been replaced by machines) or in a chemical factory (which had long ago relocated to Mexico or India, where there were fewer environmental regulations and less expensive labor).\n\n“All this change will pale in comparison to what is going to come in the next wave of innovation as it hits all 196 countries on the planet,” Ross writes in his new book, “Industries of the Future.” “The coming era of globalization will unleash a wave of technological, economic and sociological change as consequential as the changes that shook my hometown in the 20th century and the changes brought on by the Internet and digitization as I was leaving college 20 years ago.”\n\nWe spoke with Ross about the change he sees coming — observations drawn in part from his tenure with Clinton, which afforded him the opportunity to observe next-generation robotics in South Korea, banking tools in parts of Africa where there were no banks and laser technology used to increase agricultural yields in New Zealand. Even the janitorial work Ross once performed might be performed by robots (which wouldn’t recoil from such odious work).\n\nSo what’s on the horizon?\n\nHere Come the Robots\n\nRoss predicts robots will increasingly occupy the world alongside us, thanks to advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning. He cites the example of automakers Toyota and Honda leveraging their expertise in mechanical engineering to create a new type of robot that will function as caregivers in the home and beyond. Toyota’s nursing aide Robina, modeled after Rosie the cartoon robot housekeeper in “The Jetsons,” is part of a line of robots designed to care for the world’s aging population.\n\n“The robots from the cartoons and movies of the 1970s are going to be the reality of the 2020s,” Ross said.\n\nRobots initially will perform jobs that are dangerous, dirty and “dreary” and require little human interaction. But over time, robots will tiptoe into the service sector. Two developments make this possible: robots will connect to the cloud (giving the machines enhanced smarts) and benefit from advances in modeling “belief space” — a term that refers to how math can be used to predict outcomes.\n\nWhat this means is blue collar workers in automotive factories won’t be the only ones whose jobs are threatened.\n\n“The next wave of jobs significantly at risk are low-level white collar jobs,” Ross said — people like his father, a real estate lawyer in Hurricane, West Virginia, who did house closings for 45 years. “The $1200-an-hour lawyer at Wilson Sonsini is not in danger of being displaced, but the $300-an-hour lawyer who’s doing rote work real estate closings is.”\n\nThe Codification of Money\n\nMoney has always been a physical thing — even the names of the world’s currencies connote something tangible (the Mexican peso, the Israeli shekel and the British pound all derive from words meaning weight). But Ross explores how code will transform commerce and how people around the world will receive, spend and transfer money. He acknowledges Square Chief Executive Jack Dorsey for recognizing the potential to make everyday payments using a device that is growing even more precious than our wallets: Our mobile phones.\n\n“The dollar, euro, yen and yuan — I don’t think digital currency will displace any of those,” Ross said. “But payments, which have such a ridiculous amount of friction … these should become a penny per transaction.”\n\nRoss writes about bitcoin and the rise of cryptocurrency. While initially hostile to the concept, Wall Street is warming to the technology. Goldman Sachs and Chinese investment firm IDG invested $50 million in a bitcoin company because they liked how the technology made it easy to move money around the globe. He predicts cryptocurrency will eventually become mainstream.\n\nThe Weaponization of Code\n\nThe world has left the Cold War behind, only to enter into a Code War, writes Ross.\n\nTerms for the weaponization of code are well known: Malware, virus, Trojan horse and denial-of-service attack. But the world is just beginning to grasp the implications. Ross notes that the cost of cyberattacks now exceeds $400 billion a year — a number that’s larger than the gross domestic product of about 160 countries around the world.\n\nRoss describes the weaponization of code as “the most significant development in warfare” since the weaponization of fissile material. He said creating a nuclear weapon requires scarce talent and resources. Not so for hackers, whose attacks against public companies such as retail giant Target and Sony Pictures offer vivid illustrations of the damage that can be inflicted.\n\n“I’m a pretty optimistic person. This is the part of the book where I took the darkest view,” Ross said. “I spent too much time in the White House situation room, learning about the disasters averted.”\n\nThroughout the book Ross examines the topic of competitiveness — what it takes for societies, families and individuals to thrive.\n\n“There is no greater indicator of an innovative culture than the empowerment of women,” Ross writes. “Fully integrating and empowering women economically and politically is the most important step that a country or company can take to strengthen its competitiveness. Societies that do not overcome their negative cultural legacies regarding the treatment of women will founder in the next wave of innovation.”']"
02/09/2016,"['Valve\n\nValve looks set to offer new ways to buy content on its PC gaming platform Steam, with hints of bitcoin payments found in the client\'s translation servers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Valve has yet to make an announcement, strong evidence was found by reddit user Haoose and screencapped here.\n\nRather than directly trading bitcoins through Steam, it appears Valve will be using the third-party BitPay. This hypothetically saves Valve from having to do any internal conversion or calculation based on bitcoin\'s current market value, and should make transactions smoother.\n\nValve already offers multiple ways to pay for games -- credit or debit cards, PayPal, Skrill, top-up cards -- so adding bitcoin isn\'t a huge surprise. There is a possible hurdle for buyers though: wait times before getting your games.\n\nAn entry under ""checkout_receipt_pending_bitcoin_long"" -- text that could be presented to consumers after completing a bitcoin purchase -- reads ""Your purchase is currently in progress and is waiting for confirmation of bitcoin delivery from BitPay. This process can take several minutes to a few days for confirmation. Valve will send an email receipt to you when payment is received for this purchase. During this time you may continue shopping for other games, though you will not be able to re-purchase any products that are pending in this transaction.""\n\nThis is likely because, unlike PayPal or credit cards, bitcoin payments aren\'t instant. Although BitPay, like PayPal, essentially serves as a guarantor for customers while purchases are processed, Steam could be extra-cautious with accepting the virtual currecy, forcing a holding period before ""releasing"" a game to players\' account.\n\nIf Valve does indeed introduce bitcoin payments, some may already see it as too little, too late. In recent months, debate has risen over the future of the cryptocurrency, prompted at least in part by one developer saying it has already failed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaying a small number of people overwhelmingly control the system, which was meant to be decentralised precisely to prevent the pyramid structure of more conventional financial institutions, Mike Hearn wrote that the community, and more importantly, the technology underpinning bitcoin has failed. (Valery Vavilov, co-founder of BitFury, a bitcoin blockchain infrastructure provider and transaction processing company, disagreed.)\n\nWhen or if Valve officially launches bitcoin transactions remains to be seen, but given Steam\'s prominence among PC gamers and the overlap between that community and those using bitcoin, the payment option sure to find its fans.', 'Bitcoin is in the midst of a civil war. It has been simmering for some time, though it remained largely out of view to the general public until last month, when a prominent Bitcoin developer announced that the cryptocurrency and the technology underlying were, in his opinion, a failed experiment.\n\nThe developer, a former Google engineer named Mike Hearn, believed that bitter infighting and intransigence among the core development team had paralyzed the system, which was facing growing pains that, unaddressed, would cripple the currency so badly it was unlikely to recover. Pundits piled on to pronounce Bitcoin dead, and even its staunchest advocates admitted it was unclear if the project would continue to thrive.\n\nIn the three weeks since, a fascinating debate has played out across the globe, as the Bitcoin community struggled to find a way forward. The future remains uncertain, but for now, the cryptocurrency has split in two, with the core development team going in one direction, and a group of influential miners, exchanges, and startups going in another, a separation known as a hard fork. They have created competing versions, Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic, each stemming from the same source code, but now controlled by separate groups of programmers and with major differences in their roadmap.\n\nIt’s an intriguing test case for open-source software, highlighting how decentralized systems must grapple with internal conflict. It could end up shining a light on the resilience of the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin. But one of our era’s most interesting new ideas, today valued at over $5 billion, could just as easily go up in smoke.\n\nThe network wasn\'t scaling to meet increasing demand\n\nFirst, let me try and lay out the issue Bitcoin is facing. The basic system works as follows: Bitcoin miners use processing power to complete complex math problems, the cryptographic proof of work that validates bitcoin transactions on an open ledger, known as the blockchain. Miners are rewarded for this validating work with bitcoins. Up until now, each block in the chain was limited to 1mb in size, and the rate at which blocks are mined is relatively fixed. But as the number of users and transactions on the network has grown, this limit has begun to create backlogs, leading to slow and unreliable payments.\n\nFor those who want the Bitcoin system to continue to grow and thrive, this is troubling. Merchants can’t rely on digital transactions that can take minutes or hours to validate. A segment of the community has been arguing for an increase in the block size, with proposals over the last few years for changes to the core software that would increase each block in size to 2, 4, or even 8 megabytes. But another segment of the Bitcoin community has been pushing back, arguing that increasing the block size erodes a core feature, some might say ideological principle, of Bitcoin: decentralization.\n\nMaking Bitcoin more professional threatens to centralize power\n\nThe larger the block size, the more computing power is required to mine blocks. That would shrink the pool of people who can effectively act as miners. The increase would also affect users running full nodes, people who aren’t rewarded monetarily, like miners, but who play a crucial role in the peer-to-peer network of Bitcoin by helping to ensure the same digital tokens aren’t spent twice. The smaller the network, the less decentralized it becomes, something which a core group in the Bitcoin community is aggressively opposed to.\n\nThe two sides — those in favor of increasing block size (Classic), and those opposed (Core) — have become increasingly hostile with one another over the last few months. The developer who declared Bitcoin a failed experiment, Mike Hearn, bemoaned the fact that, not only was the community unable to agree on a way forward, but that the argument had boiled over into censorship of its most popular discussion forum on Reddit, DDoS cyberattacks intended to intimidate rivals, and a general atmosphere of ideological civil war about the proper path forward.\n\nBitcoin is not the first open-source project to struggle with these issues. In theory, the approach is highly democratic and meritocratic. Anyone can suggest a change to the code, and community input, along with trial and error, decides which improvements to keep and which to reject. But in practice, a small group of core coders are the only ones who can implement these changes, because code must be thoroughly vetted and tested to ensure that it doesn’t break the system when implemented. Imagine it as a world where any citizen can easily write legislation, mark it up, suggest changes, and show evidence for their proposal’s value over another, but where making it into law still requires the consensus of a core group empowered with control.\n\nBitcoin is not dead,we are going through a similar process that early IETF & ICANN went through pic.twitter.com/YHgkQgmBJw — Austin Hill (@austinhill) January 16, 2016\n\nFrom Linux to ICANN, software projects with this structure have had to contend with moments where a large or vocal segment of the community disagrees with the direction the core group is taking. In some cases, as with Linus Torvalds of Linux, the founder remains a part of the community and has the authority to settle internal disputes. Bitcoin is an interesting case because it has an anonymous creator, Satoshi, who has achieved godlike status for many of Bitcoin’s strongest believers. They pick and choose bits of the text he left behind to bolster their arguments — You see, Satoshi always meant for blocksize to increase! — Never. Idiocy! Heresy!\n\nOne side of the argument does have a serious logical flaw\n\nI’ve been following Bitcoin since 2011, but have to confess that the technical arguments about this issue are often incomprehensible to me. I can, however, spot a fundamental logical inconsistency on the side arguing against a change in block size. Take a look at points 5 and 6 in this essay. In the first half of this couplet, the author, representing a large mining pool, argues that the existence of numerous mines and full nodes is crucial to the health and decentralization of Bitcoin. And yet in the next breath he argues that the votes of these users, registered by their decision to adopt certain software over another, should not be used as governance for deciding the future of Bitcoin. No one group should make decisions for Bitcoin, in other words, but a small group of unelected experts, the core developers, should run Bitcoin.\n\nThe group in favor of increasing the block size has laid out a more democratic path forward. As written, the new code offered up by Classic will only begin creating bigger blocks — moving up from 1MB to 2MB — 28 days after 75 percent of hashpower has shown support by producing blocks with a special bit set in the block version number."" Just as processing power has been the capital committed to create bitcoins and validate transactions on the blockchain, it will now be used to record a vote by the community.\n\nIt\'s unclear what will happen if Bitcoin Classic executes a successful hard fork\n\nIn the first few days since the release of the Bitcoin Classic beta software, it’s become the second most popular version, overtaking an earlier fork, Bitcoin XT, the variant pushed by Hearn before he gave up. We don’t know yet which side will end up with more support, and there are countless detailed arguments about why the split will save or break Bitcoin for good. One thing we know for sure is that a protracted battle would likely damage trust in bitcoin the currency, because if two competing blockchains live side by side, it becomes much easier for criminals to spend the same money twice.\n\nThe thing about Bitcoin is that anyone, with fairly minimal computing resources, can follow along in real time, evaluate the debate, download the software, set up their node, and add their vote. We\'re about to find out if that wide open consensus machine can act in its own best interest when the system reaches a breaking point.', ""DCE Brief\n\nCHICAGO — North America was a frontier society, at times being careless and wasteful in the pursuit of expansion and manifest destiny. This meant North Americans experienced more and larger fires than anyone else, which led to the need for more effective firefighting weapons.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th century most homes were primitively heated and built from wood. Limited resources and weak transportation meant it was difficult to replace lost property, thus arose a need for fire prevention regulations and fire wardens to keep order on the fire scene.\n\nThrough the years, as building styles and technology changed, firefighters were forced to adapt and come up with solutions to new challenges. From buckets to hand pumps, all the way to steam and gas power, firefighters have become masters at adaptation. With the adoption of computer aided dispatch (CAD), first responders began their foray into the digital age. Current CAD systems have drawbacks such as centralized servers that require expensive backup power systems to ensure that the singular fail point remains operational, after all, lives and property depend on it.\n\nThe technology behind Bitcoin, known as blockchain, is a distributed ledger of all actions that have occurred on the network. Currently these actions are largely relegated to transfer of wealth represented as encrypted data. Copies of the entire blockchain are relayed among numerous nodes by various means, including but not limited to, internet, satellite, and radio.The decentralized nature of blockchain technology makes the system far less prone to total failure. Solar powered devices acting as nodes can provide a cost effective fail-safe, relaying all blockchain information to computers and mobile devices.\n\nBlockchain tech can be applied to firefighting and emergency services in a number of ways that will improve logistical efficiency and operational coordination. Dispatchers could utilize semi automated blockchain based CAD, that will help 911 services obtain information as callers wait during high volume times. Pre-incident plans for local buildings could be uploaded on the blockchain, making it not only easier for the local fire department, but also for those with mutual aid agreements to know what they should expect when assisting in another jurisdiction. Private keys reserved for authorized personnel only, keeps sensitive information safe and secure. Sidechains available to local civilians could provide secure lines of communication between a fire department and community residents. Employee memos can be securely relayed to firefighters, and blockchain based paging systems could provide more detailed information to volunteers.\n\nOn scene, blockchain coupled with near field communication (NFC), could help automate breathing apparatus accountability. It could eventually provide unlimited communication channels when block size is no longer an issue and block time is successfully reduced. In cases of discrepancy, simply referring to data stored on the blockchain will help resolve many issues. Behind the scenes, inventory can be marked in and out of service, with full maintenance record of each piece of equipment stored on the fire departments blockchain. Accounting, payroll, and employee hour logs will become fully automated and human error resistant.\n\nWhile none of these blockchain features are in place yet, because the technology is so new, all it takes is a few brave individuals willing to take a chance. Whether or not blockchain is up to the task of acting as a fire service lifeline, will be determined by the department who takes the forefront in testing and implementing it. One thing is clear, if this new technology can help save even one life, it's worth trying out.\n\nRepublished with permission from DCE Brief"", 'DUBAI // Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are set to revolutionise how people pay for goods and services and move money around the world, according to the co-founder and president of Blockchain, a digital wallet and software company.\n\nCryptocurrencies are digital currencies exchanged over the internet and mainly used outside existing banking and government institutions.\n\nNicolas Carey, speaking on the second day of the World Government Summit, said the way we pay for items over the internet was changing, reported the state news agency, Wam.\n\n“There is a great deal of talk about financial inclusion, but there are 2.5 billion people on Earth who do not have access to a bank account,” Mr Carey said. “Even in the United States, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, 20.1 per cent of households are underbanked and 33 per cent of millennials do not expect to have a bank account in the next five years.\n\n“If you combine all these people, with everyone who has access to the internet over smartphones, you can see the potential for cryptocurrencies.\n\n“Digital is part of everyone’s DNA.

It watches the user's clipboard, and whenever a Bitcoin address is detected, it searches its own database of 10,000 addresses and replaces the original with one that looks alike. This way, the trojan hijacks transactions and sends Bitcoin to the crook's wallet addresses instead.\n\nDeck trackers deliver spyware\n\nBut this is not the only threat. Symantec also reports on malware infecting unofficial Hearthstone add-ons used for deck tracking. One such example is an add-on called Hearthstone Deck Tracker(.exe), which comes bundled with Backdoor.Breut.\n\nIf the name sounds familiar, it is because Backdoor.Breut is a powerful piece of spyware that was used in the past to steal financial information and corporate secrets from companies in India, the US, and the UK.\n\nBackdoor.Breut installs a backdoor on all infected devices and logs keystrokes, steals login passwords, and records webcam feeds.\n\nEven though Blizzard, Hearthstone's maker, doesn't consider deck trackers to be cheating tools, users should avoid them altogether.\n\nAnd there's also the problem with Hearthstone bots, which help users automate the game while away or sleeping. Even if Symantec didn't detect any malware in any Hearthstone bots, the company says that users should stay away from these game cheating applications as well, since they provide a perfect medium for inserting malware on their PCs and smartphones."", ""A man was arrested here in connection with an international card cloning racket which used to transfer stolen money to through virtual currency 'bitcoins', a mode of payment that is not authorised in and several other nations.\n\n\n\nIn a joint operation with their counterparts, Police's Crime Branch arrested 25-year-old Pankaj Bharadwaj from near Gate.\n\n\n\nBharadwaj's name had emerged during the interrogation of one Nisar Ansari who was arrested from area in earlier, said a senior official.Ansari, who allegedly cloned debit and credit cards to illegally withdraw money from the accounts of unsuspecting persons, told police he used to transfer the stolen money to one Sumair Sheikh in via hawala channels, the official said.Police was informed about Sheikh and a trap was laid to arrest him, but the receiver of the money sent by Ansari turned out to be Bhardwaj, a resident ofBharadwaj told police that the international cloning racket he was part of allegedly operated in Delhi, Mumbai, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, several south Indian states and Dubai, the official said.Bharadwaj used to convert the money he received from Ansari into bitcoins and then transfer them to Sheikh in Sheikh then encashed the virtual money there.Around Rs 8 lakh was recovered from Bharadwaj's possession, the official said.Bitcoin is a cryptographic, digital and experimental currency generated through a peer-to-peer network which surfaced in 2008.

This result is consistent with both established Ninth Circuit law and section 550(a)’s purpose of restoring the estate to the financial condition it would have enjoyed had the transfers not occurred.”\n\nPredictably, Lowe pushed back, seeking the opposite ruling in a 5th February court filing. The heart of his argument was that, during the time he was promoting HashFast’s products, the company was treating bitcoin as a type of currency.\n\n“The bitcoin Dr. Lowe received from HashFast should be treated as currency, not a commodity,” the filing states. “That was how HashFast intended bitcoin to be treated at the time it sent the bitcoin to Dr. Lowe, and that is how federal agencies, merchants, courts, the Debtor, and the Trustee himself have treated bitcoin. The Court should not grant the Trustee the undeserved windfall he is seeking.”\n\nFurther, Lowe asked the court to reject the trustee’s claim that the bitcoin transfers were fraudulent in nature.\n\nThe suit stems from the firm’s presale of HashFast’s BabyJet bitcoin mining products, which some customers said they did not receive after paying thousands of dollars per unit. HashFast later denied it was facing insolvency, but ultimately ended up in bankruptcy court.\n\nLast August, a US district court judge approved fraud claims against the firm and two of its executives.\n\nBoth sides cite regulatory precedent\n\nIn their filing from 22nd January, the trustees point to decisions by the US Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that deemed bitcoin a type of property or commodity, respectively, as backing.\n\nAcknowledging that bitcoin can and has been used as a medium of exchange, the trustees go on to state that because it is deemed as a kind of property or commodity, the bitcoin in question would appreciate in value – a fact that should be “to the benefit of creditors and the estate”.\n\n“The law on recovery under section 550(a) [of the US Bankruptcy Code] is well-settled and indisputable,” the filing goes on to state. “The Court should grant the Motion and enter an order directing that, if the transfers are avoided, the estate is entitled to recover either the 3,000 bitcoin or the value of the bitcoin measured at the transfer date or the time of recovery, whichever is greater.”\n\nIn his response, Lowe pointed to rulings by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission, both of which have deemed bitcoin to be a kind of money, or a substitute for money, for regulatory purposes.\n\nFurther, the defense pushed back against what it called a misinterpretation of the IRS and CFTC rulings.\n\n“Like the IRS guidance, the CFTC order is regulating bitcoin in essentially the same manner as it regulates other forms of currency. The CFTC merely defined bitcoin as property or a commodity for the purposes of regulating it, while at the same time essentially acknowledging that it is a currency,” the filing states. “Accordingly, the Trustee's argument with regard to the CFTC is nothing more than semantics, asking the Court to adopt a form over substance interpretation.”\n\nKasolas is being represented by San Francisco-based law firm Duane Morris LLP, while Lowe is being represented by Brian Klein of Los Angeles-based law firm Baker Marquart LLP and David Poitras of Jeffer Mangels Butler & Mitchell LLP.\n\nCorrection: Mark Lowe's online handle is 'CypherDoc', not 'cyberdoc'.

02/10/2016,"['The first release for an alternative implementation of bitcoin that would double its transaction capacity has been published.\n\nToday, bitcoin users run or rely on versions of Bitcoin Core, the descendent of the original bitcoin software developed by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Yet the ongoing debate on how to increase capacity has opened the door to other implementations of bitcoin to gain prominence, as previously demonstrated by the rise and subsequent fall of Bitcoin XT.\n\nThe release of Bitcoin Classic, which constitutes a repackaging of the latest Bitcoin Core software with support for bigger blocks, indicates what could perhaps be a new phase in the ongoing debate whether or how to scale the bitcoin network’s transaction capacity. It follows the release of a second beta version last week.\n\nFor over a year, members of the bitcoin development community, users and business interests have engaged in a wide and often bitter debate about the block size.\n\nThe latest proposal, in the form of Bitcoin Classic, would raise the maximum size of transactions blocks from a 1 megabyte (MB) limit to a cap of 2 MB. If activated, the new software would constitute a split in the bitcoin network, each with its own divergent transaction histories after the point of divergence.\n\nSince it was unveiled last month, Bitcoin Classic has attracted both supporters and detractors who, depending on their point of view, say it represents either the next phase for bitcoin development or a threat to its very existence.\n\nSo far, the proposal, which would effectively split the existing history of bitcoin transactions into two (one with 2 MB blocks and one with 1 MB blocks), has garnered significant support from startups working in the bitcoin space, as well as a number of bitcoin miners.\n\nDiscussions about the proposal, as well as the broader issue of whether to increase the transaction capacity on the bitcoin network, have raged on social media for weeks. The debate has effectively split bitcoin’s active Reddit community in two, and further debate has taken place on Twitter as well as individual Slack channels dedicated to Core and Classic.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nNow that Bitcoin Classic has been released, one question remains: Will it actually be adopted?\n\nPreliminary data suggests that the number of nodes running Bitcoin Classic is on the rise. According to node data site Coin.Dance, there are more than 500 nodes running the software at press time, compared to roughly 4,100 running Bitcoin Core.\n\nYet for the software to \'activate\', the code requires that the last 751 out of 1,000 blocks be mined that support 2 MB blocks. Once that happens, a 28-day period will begin in which node operators and miners would need to replace their software in order to be compatible with Bitcoin Classic once the larger blocks start being processing.\n\nOn a conference call today hosted by bitcoin services startup Coinbase, which pledged its support to operate Bitcoin Classic nodes, original Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen said that he expects miners that don\'t immediately support Classic will move quickly to do so as the anticipated support ramps up.\n\n""Once you get to 75% of miners, the remaining 25% come along very, very quickly,"" he said. ""We’ve done these...not exactly this type of upgrade but we’ve done similar types of upgrades in the past, so we do know what’s likely to happen. And so once miners see that all the other miners are going in a certain direction, they have an incredibly strong incentive to follow.""\n\nGoing forward, adoption depends on a majority of node operators and miners taking the step to break away from the existing network. To date, new versions of the bitcoin software have been rolled out via voluntary soft forks.\n\nThe Bitcoin Classic team, which counts among its members developers Andresen and Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik, said that it expects to release another version based on Bitcoin Core 0.12 in the next few weeks.\n\nWith the release also comes an updated list of developers and contributors. In addition to Andresen and Garzik, developers include Pedro Pinheiro, Tom Zander and Jon Rumion.\n\nJonathan Toomim, who was listed at the top of the developer list on earlier versions of the Bitcoin Classic site, is now listed as an ""external advisor"" alongside Ledger editor Peter Rizun.\n\nFormer Bitcoin Foundation board member Olivier Janssens is listed as a ""facilitator"", and Final Hash CTO Marshall Long is said to be providing support on the mining side, though his name was previously removed from the Bitcoin Classic site.\n\nDebate to continue\n\nSupporters of a block size increase say that a capacity boost is needed in the near-term to make room for more transactions and stave off what they call prohibitively high transaction fees.\n\nThose backing Bitcoin Classic say that competition among implementations of bitcoin is needed in order to spur development and create a greater degree of choice for users.\n\nOpponents say the changes proposed are too fast and too risky, given what they say are lingering questions about how a hard fork – wherein nodes are required to download new software or risk being effectively cut out of the network due to incompatibility – could be successfully conducted.\n\nQuestions have also been raised about aspects of the governance system proposed for Bitcoin Classic, the introduction of two functioning blockchains that share years of transaction history and each with its own network of assets, and the exact degree of support from bitcoin miners for Bitcoin Classic versus a broader block size increase, particularly those based in China.\n\nAt the same time, there appears to be support among developers in the bitcoin community for some form of capacity increase, including a raising of the block size.\n\nBitcoin Core developers and supporters have rallied around a proposal called Segregated Witness that changes how signature data is included in transactions. This proposal has its detractors as well, who say that it adds unnecessary complexity to the network.\n\nOverall, the debate has proven to be as acrimonious as it has been divisive. Accusations that Bitcoin Classic essentially constitutes a coup, as well as allegations that Bitcoin Core is acting at the behest of the startup Blockstream, have thus far colored the nature of the debate in recent weeks.\n\nToday’s release is unlikely to change this state of affairs.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Investigations revealed that the stolen cash was converted to bitcoin before being dispersed to members of the crime syndicate.\n\nAn international crime racket involving key members in India and the United Arab Emirates was busted by Indian authorities. The criminal activity saw cloned cards stealing money from ATMs in various locations across India, the Times of India reports.\n\nEventually, the stolen money was converted to bitcoin before being transferred to the kingpin of the operation in Dubai, where the alleged kingpin – ‘Sheikh’, swapped the bitcoins back to the local currency.\n\nIncidentally, one of the accused members of the operation was the operations manager of a prominent bitcoin exchange in India.\n\nThe Racket\n\nThe crime syndicate operated in several states across India by using the cloned cards to siphon money out of victims’ accounts. While investigating the crime, an early arrest revealed that the operators used over 20 cloned cards in various Indian states. It was also revealed that the money was transferred from India to Dubai through a ‘hawala’ operator.\n\nA ‘hawala’ operator is essentially an informal facilitator of money transfers who operates with a network of other similar operators as a means to work around the banking system.\n\nFundamentally, one approaches a hawala to transfer funds to a different country. The operator then instructs his associate in the relevant location to make the final payout to the recipient. The traditional system exists in South Asian and Arab countries.\n\nIncluding a Bitcoin Expert\n\nFollowing multiple red flags from different states, law enforcement authorities in Mumbai, India, were received a tip that pointed toward a hawala operator in Delhi. This operator, turned out to be Pankaj Bhardwaj, who was the operations manager at Coinsecure, a bitcoin trading firm.\n\nBhardwaj was promptly arrested and confessed to sending ?300,000 (approx. $45,000) in bitcoins toover the past six months to Sheikh in Dubai.\n\nIn a statement today via its blog, Coinsecure revealed that Bharadwaj has been relieved from his position from the company. Furthermore, the exchange confirmed that the Bharadwaj’s illegal activities did not see any involvement with the company.\n\nPankaj was a key part of our growing team as he handled several of our operational challenges. As an automated trading platform, we did not require to harness his trading skills.\n\nWhile Pankaj, had an impeccable reputation in terms of his integrity in trades, it has recently been established that he has been involved in several trades that were subject to question. Post a brief absence, we found out through media sources that Pankaj was in question for these trades by the authorities.\n\nThese trades were done on his personal front with no involvement with the company and that has been ascertained by the authorities.\n\nWhile cash trades and questionable outcomes can be attempted with Bitcoin, the cost is always decided by the person indulging this technology. While, acknowledging Pankaj’s contribution to the growth of Bitcoin in India, we as a company have removed him from his position at Coinsecure.\n\nThis is to enforce our commitment towards maintaining our responsibility towards a clean and progressive Bitcoin system for India.\n\nBitcoin’s Reputation in India\n\nWhile the news unquestionably brings the spotlight back on Bitcoin’s role in criminal enterprise, it is notable that the use of bitcoin in India is not illegal, despite several questions raised toward such speculation in the past.\n\nA rapidly growing economy with one of the world’s youngest populations and a tech-saavy generation, brings with it, the necessary ingredients for Bitcoin interest and adoption in hugely populated country.\n\nIn 2013, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had cautioned the country against the use of Bitcoin and regulatory measures are the inherent threat to the cryptocurrency. However, that stance has softened following Bitcoin’s controversial past in India. Late 2014 saw the RBI’s chief claim that “Bitcoin was fascinating,” while adding that the future will be one of a cashless society.\n\nIn recent times, Indian bitcoin startups like Zebpay are looking to tap into the market by raising $1 million in a round of funding to promote the cryptocurrency within the country of over a billion people.\n\nThe RBI’s Role\n\nThe RBI imposes strict rules on fiat transactions in India. For instance, every transaction – toward a merchant, a bank transfer, an online payment etc – requires a one-time password, a similar security feature like two-factor authentication, to authenticate the transfer before the settlement.\n\nUber faced a significant hurdle in entering the Indian market due to this very reason, as a company that allowed instant card transfers as payments from its users to the drivers. It’s also one of the reasons that Netflix, another global company that recently entered India, might be looking at Bitcoin as an instant, permission-less mode of payment.\n\nAltogether, it is notable cloned cards dealing with fiat currency was the foundation of the ‘bitcoin-related’ crime. Following the day’s cautionary tale, better security measures to safeguard fiat currency rather than imposing controls over bitcoin, might be the way forward.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Jeff Garzik, one of the core developers of bitcoin, has a new startup modeled on his former employer, Red Hat.\n\nWant Your Own Version of Bitcoin?

Fees are set in satoshis per byte, a reference to the smallest denomination of bitcoin.\n\nThe launch comes amid a time when transaction levels are increasingly hitting all-time highs, and the community at large has been split on the question of expanding the network\'s ability to accommodate more transactions per block. To send a bitcoin transaction, users generally must include a transaction fee, which rewards the miners that process transactions and secure the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nFor obvious reasons, miners generally prioritise higher fees first, so the larger the fee, the more quickly the transaction will be written to the blockchain and confirmed.\n\nIt is not always clear what is the optimum fee level to set, though.\n\n21 Inc said:\n\n""[E]xactly how large a fee you need to get rapid transaction confirmation can be hard to predict in advance, because everyone else sending a bitcoin transaction at the same time is effectively competing with you for the speed of inclusion into the blockchain.\n\nTo counter this issue, the company created the web interface for bitcoin users who are manually sending transactions, providing users with a fair idea of the optimum fee to set for their transaction.\n\n21\'s fee predictions are based on blockchain data for the last three hours, along with the current pool of unconfirmed transactions (mempool).\n\n""From the simulations, it can be seen how fast transactions with different fees are likely to be included in the upcoming blocks.

Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed at will by central banks, the total supply of bitcoins is fixed by the consensus rules of the system. Because of its deflationary nature, the digital currency is often compared to precious metals such as gold, which also undergo a resource-intensive creation or mining process.\n\nThis process of mathematically securing transactions in a block of chains called mining requires a tremendous supply of computing power and electricity. In exchange for securing the Bitcoin network and processing transactions, the protocol currently rewards these miners with 25 bitcoins for every block of transactions found. However, this reward for miners will soon be cut in half from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins. This “halving” will occur at block 420,000, which is expected to be mined in the middle of 2016.\n\nSurge or Stability?\n\nThe decline of miner’s reward simply means that the Bitcoin network will begin to generate bitcoins at a much slower rate. If the demand for bitcoin remains constant through the year while the supply is cut in half, simple economics dictates that the price should rise until there is a new equilibrium between supply and demand. Whether or not this supply change is already a factor in the price of bitcoin is a point of disagreement.\n\nSome argue that the Bitcoin community has been fully aware of the halving of miners’ reward for a long time and that the actual decline in the supply of bitcoins will not surprise most Bitcoin enthusiasts and traders in the community.\n\nHistorically, halving of miner’s reward has had no substantial effect on the price of Bitcoin. On November 28, 2012, the first time the miners’ reward was halved, there was no visible impact on the value of Bitcoin, which was worth around USD $13.40 per bitcoin.\n\nThis occurred when block 210,000 was solved.\n\nConsidering the historical result of the “halving day” and the increasing awareness of Bitcoin, it is difficult to predict whether the price of Bitcoin will surge or maintain its stability after the halving of miner’s reward.\n\nAs Bitcoin security expert and author of Mastering Bitcoin Andreas Antonopoulos explains, the impact of halving on the price of Bitcoin depends on a wide range of factors, including the difficulty and transaction volume of Bitcoin.\n\n“I can't predict price. No one can. Anyone who does, even for 10 minutes, is lying,” said Antonopoulos. “The reward halving will change the inflation rate in Bitcoin. How that affects the overall economy depends on the conditions of all the other parameters in the economy: price, adoption, transaction volume, hashrate, difficulty, investments, other currencies, world market conditions, etc.”"", 'Researchers use $1 AWS servers to crack Bitcoin brain wallet passwords\n\nBitcoin is a very popular cryptocurrency that is stored in Bitcoin accounts, called wallets. These wallets are distinguished from one another using an “address” that plays the role of a username. Bitcoin addresses are actually a string ID that has between 26 and 35 alpha-numeric characters.\n\nThis wallet can be opened by a private key so that can be used to authorize bitcoin transactions. If the user loses this private key, they lose their only method of accessing a wallet. In most cases, users are supplied with an automatically generated private key when they register an account, which they can change later on.\n\nOne of the most common practices to choose a Bitcoin wallet is via the “Brain Wallet” technique. Users can visit special sites or use special applications, sometimes embedded within Bitcoin wallet services, to enter a regular text-based passphrase. This passphrase is then converted using the SHA-256 hash algorithm into a 256-bit number that becomes the Bitcoin wallet’s private key. In case the user loses their private key, they can always reproduce it by converting their passphrase into a 256-bit number via the SHA-256 algorithm.\n\nNow, three researchers have found out a rather simple way to crack the Bitcoin brain wallet passwords. The researchers have published a paper detailing the method, which they claim, is 2.5 times faster than previous techniques and incredibly cheap to perform.\n\nWhite Ops security researcher Ryan Castellucci had demonstrated last summer at the DEFCON 23 security conference in Las Vegas, USA that it is easy for hackers to hack private bitcoin keys. He was joined by two more researchers from University College London to crack the bitcoin wallet password.\n\nThe three researchers used their technique against real-life Bitcoin wallets and managed to crack 18,000 passwords. Some of the passwords included silly passphrases like:\n\n? say hello to my little friend\n\n? to be or not to be\n\n? party like it’s 1999\n\n? yohohoandabottleofrum\n\n? dudewheresmycar\n\n? andreas antonopoulos\n\n? Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n? blablablablablablabla\n\n? for the longest time\n\n? captain spaulding\n\nThe researcher also revealed that a potential hacker could use the basic Amazon EC2 account to check over 500,000 Bitcoin passwords per second. The researchers said that by renting a $1 EC2 server, an attacker would be able to check 17.9 billion password strings. To check a trillion passwords, it would cost the attacker only $55.86 (€49.63).\n\nThe conclusion of this research is that users should stay away from using common passphrases to generate Bitcoin private keys, and despite the complex cryptography utilities used to build Bitcoin, the service’s security can still be sabotaged by the maligned practices users employ when choosing passwords for online accounts.\n\nThe researchers have published their Speed Optimizations in Bitcoin Key Recovery Attacks research paper on International Association for Cryptologic Research website.', 'Financial compliance authority Juan Llanos is joining blockchain analytics firm Coinalytics as the executive vice president of business development.\n\nThere, Llanos will be charged with establishing partnerships for the blockchain intelligence startup and working with customers at all stages, from initial engagement to onboarding to developing new solutions on top of the platform.\n\nThe role ""is a convergence of my passion with an opportunity,"" Llanos said, noting he has been studying data mining and machine learning for transaction monitoring, even helping to build some of these monitoring programs.\n\nThe hiring comes at a time when blockchain analytics platforms are gaining momentum, with Barclays partnering with Chainalysis in October and Coinalytics raising a $1.1m seed round in September. In August, Elliptic won ""Security Project of the Year"" after launching a blockchain visualization tool for the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nCurrently, Coinalytics is allowing several companies to use and test its API, which parses the bitcoin blockchain for easy querying.\n\nBut Llanos said the company is developing machine learning systems to analyze any blockchain as the industry expands to include public, permissioned and private ledgers.\n\nWhile Coinalytics is focusing on its AML compliance product targeted at any companies processing bitcoin transactions today, it sees its analytics platform used in many verticals, including capital markets, the Internet of Things and law enforcement.\n\nTested hire\n\nAs a former co-founder and compliance officer at remittance provider Unidos Financial Services, Llanos brings significant experience to the role. While Unidos worked only in traditional remittances, Llanos continued to write about bitcoin, emerging as a certified anti-money laundering expert on the subject during his tenure.\n\nAs the bitcoin industry started to gain more attention from regulatory agencies, alongside its increased consumer adoption and investor interest, Llanos was pulled to work for the industry.\n\nFor a little more than a year and a half, he was the executive vice president of strategic partnerships and chief transparency officer at BitReserve (today, Uphold). He has also advised a number of bitcoin companies, including BitPagos, BitWage and Mexican bitcoin exchange startup, meXBT.\n\nLlanos\' most high-profile role, however, was as a risk and compliance expert on the Bitcoin Foundation\'s regulatory affairs committee, where he was often its spokesperson on the subject.\n\nFabio Federici, Coinalytics co-founder and CEO, was also keen to stress how Llanos will move the company forward, however, adding:\n\n""Compliance and risk management will play a major role in fostering the adoption of blockchain technology across a variety of industries.""\n\nHiring visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nWelcome to a get-rich-quick scheme that has, it claims, created 300 millionaires in a year.\n\nCalled OneCoin, it’s supposed to be a virtual or crypto currency and rival to the market-leading Bitcoin – digital money that can be traded and spent online.\n\nThe audience at a recruiting rally last Saturday at a London hotel was told that it is also a way to get very rich.\n\n“The earlier you join, the more you make,” gushed one speaker.\n\nThe rally was billed as the first UK national event for OneCoin and attracted a whooping crowd of 1,000.\n\nI won’t be joining, here’s why.\n\nSmoke and Mirrors\n\nYour joining fee – ranging from a £100 Starter Package to £28,000 for a Special Combo Package – does not buy OneCoins themselves. Instead it just buys you tokens. The idea is that these can later be exchanged or “mined” to get OneCoins.\n\nSome deals involve so-called splits which double your stash of tokens.\n\nA speaker, almost crazed with enthusiasm, gave the example of someone who pays 5,000 euros – about £3,900 – for the Tycoon Trader package. Thanks to splits this turns into £8,500.\n\nAnd – get this – that’s without the value of OneCoin even increasing. Yes, you can more than double your money even if the thing you’ve invested in stays at the same price.\n\nThat’s the worst-case scenario, too. The speaker held out the possibility of your 5,000 euros turning into 37,710 as OneCoin rises in price.\n\nThe possibility of this virtual currency falling was, er, not mentioned.\n\nAppeals to Greed\n\n“I’m like you guys, I want to be rich,” declared a speaker. “Why do I want to be rich? Because even if I cry, I prefer to cry in my tinted Porsche than the back of a double decker bus.”\n\nKey speaker Kari Wahlroos, the OneCoin Europe ambassador, strode on stage in sunglasses.\n\n“Do you know why I wear shades?” he asked. “Because the future looks so bright.” And he insisted: “I am here to make you filthy rich”.\n\nWhich just made me feel dirty.\n\nHere We Go Again\n\nKari used to bang the drum as a Crown Ambassador for something called Wellstar – motto: “Building your own dream life”. He was on stage in 2014 wearing those same shades, only the future didn’t turn out to be so bright for him.\n\nHe parted company with it amid a public slanging match on Facebook full of claim and counterclaim.\n\nWahlroos said “This company will never deliver on the promises” while the Wellstar founder Christian Weisner accused him of making “cheap and false allegations”.\n\nDue Diligence\n\nKari claimed that OneCoin was ranked No 2 in the world by market capital. In crypto-currencies, this is measured by multiplying the number of coins by their value.\n\nBitcoin is the world leader, with a market capital of $5.7billion. Kari claimed that OneCoin came next, with a market capital of $3billion. Yet if you look on websites such as coinmarketcap.com that value these currencies, OneCoin is not second, third, fourth or indeed anywhere at all. It is non-existent.\n\nPressure Sales\n\nThe audience was tempted with a Special Combo Package. You get 506,000 tokens, and six splits turn them into 32million tokens. The cost was roughly £28,000 and those splits would turn that into £1.2million.\n\nAnd that’s also even if OneCoin doesn’t increase in value – that financial miracle again. If the value goes up your investment is worth even more. But hurry, this offer is available only until February 20.\n\nThe Maths Don’t Work\n\nA group of OneCoin members climbed on stage and were introduced as “the special people, they came out from their comfort zone, they saw the vision”. They spoke of the number of people they’ve recruited – 20… 100… even 1,000 in one case. If those 1,000 hope to match this by getting 1,000 recruits each, that would need a million people.\n\nAnd if that million want 1,000 recruits each, well, good luck getting 1,000 million people to “see the vision”.\n\nThe Small Print\n\nAt the bottom of the terms and conditions on the OneCoin website are two tell-tale phrases. The first is: “The company does not warrant that product descriptions or other content is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.” The second: “The company reserves the right to, at any given time, change the OneCoin Compensation Plan.”\n\nIt Doesn’t Add Up\n\nThe audience was told that there are already 1,000 crypto-currencies in the world. Yet the founder of OneCoin, Ruja Ignatova from Bulgaria, declared: “We can be one of the first.”\n\nSound of Silence\n\nKari and Ruja left the stage immediately after their lectures. No one was given the chance to ask awkward questions. My subsequent emails to them have not had any meaningful response.\n\nWho Are You?\n\nIs OneCoin incorporated and, if so, where and who are the directors and shareholders? None of these questions are answered on its website.\n\nReflected Glory\n\nSpeakers referenced genuine business giants – Bill Gates and Richard Branson were named even though neither have any connection with OneCoin.\n\nAs for Bitcoin, I lost track of the number of times that was cited.\n\nFriends and Family\n\nBig payouts were promised for enlisting more recruits. “Every person you introduce, you make 10% of whatever they put into the company,” gushed a speaker. “You get an investor on 5,000 euros, you get 500 euros.”\n\nThat alone would have me heading for the door. Don’t worry, the audience was told: “Crazy people make crazy money.”\n\nAll Fur Coat and No Knickers\n\nDespite all the talk of riches, the event felt cheap. Tickets cost £25 yet there was not so much as a complimentary coffee. And anyone expecting some paperwork, yet alone glossy brochures, would have been disappointed.\n\nRead more: Andrew Penman investigations\n\nCan’t Stand It\n\nKey lecturers were greeted with rapturous ovations and everyone was cajoled into joining in. Before Kari Wahlroos came on stage, a voice bellowed through the speakers: “Get up! Get up!”\n\nOneCoin members even have a little sign they make to each other, holding their thumb and forefinger to make a circle.\n\nMaybe it’s meant to symbolise a coin. It certainly added to the feeling that this was more of a cult than a sound financial institution.\n\nTo me the sign looked like the number zero – which happens to be the amount I would invest.', 'Anyone who is even remotely serious about taking control of their money in the [near] future should start looking into alternative forms of finance.\n\nFinancial markets all over the world are faced with daily turmoil, and the compounding worries about European banks are only adding more fuel to the fire. Big banks have not been healthy for several years now, and things have not improved by much since the 2007 financial crisis. A combination of bank stocks crashing hard and looming worries about some banks defaulting on their debts will herald a new era of recession. Bitcoin seems to be among the only ways out, and embracing the popular digital currency is slowly becoming a necessity.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Used in Card Clone Scheme in India\n\nWhy You Need To Worry About European Banks\n\nPeople living both inside out and outside of the European Union should take this time to start worrying about the banks located in this part of the world. Even though the US Dollar is still the global currency – for now at least – the ripple effect of a collapsing European economy will affect every corner of the world.\n\nRight now, various banks are seeing their trading value decline, as their stocks are crashing hard on the markets. But that is only part of the worry, as there is a growing concern regarding several banks not being able to pay off their current debts. If this were to be the case, these European banks would have to default on debts, pushing the global economy back into recession. Plus, the ever-so-low oil prices are not helping matters much either.\n\nThe biggest risk factor in the European banking industry is none other than Deutsche Bank, as their cost to insure debt has nearly doubled over the past three months. Credit Suisse is another institution on the watch list right now, as their cost to insure has been on track to double as well. With costs going up for these banks, and revenue going down, something will have to change sooner rather than later.\n\nSpeaking of revenue going down, Deutsche Bank has lost close to half of its value in three months, which goes to show how volatile the market is right now. As a result, of this situation, every bank in the European region is looking far less attractive. When a bank’s viability is being questioned, investors will look elsewhere for a safe haven.\n\nKeeping in mind how the recent financial crisis of 2007-2008 is still hanging above everybody’s heads, it is safe to say there is a lot of fear to be found in traditional finance right now. Investors are very eager to liquidate assets at the slightest hint of a decline in value, creating very high volatility in stock markets around the world. It only takes one or two investors to start a domino effect and wreak havoc on the economy.\n\nEven though most of the bigger banks are a lot healthier right now than they were in 2007-2008, there is still plenty of reason to worry. Despite there being no signs of a collapse just yet, the current situation can not be maintained for much longer. The time of listening to financial experts is over, and people need to start drawing their own conclusions.\n\nTake Charge Of Your Financial Situation With Bitcoin\n\nAnyone who is even remotely serious about taking control of their money in the [near] future should start looking into alternative forms of finance. The FinTech sector offers some appealing alternatives, although most of these companies are using the same legacy system used by banks rights now. Whether or not that will be a good thing, remains in question for now.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, is providing people all over the world with a financial alternative that operates outside of the banks and governments. With a limited supply of Bitcoin to be available at its peak, there is no better time than now to get involved in the world of digital currency. No one is saying people should invest their life savings into Bitcoin right away, though.\n\nWhat sets Bitcoin apart from traditional finance is how the digital currency has the potential to increase in value over time. Don’t expect to get rich overnight, though, as Bitcoin is a long-term investment by all means. Unlike its more traditional counterparts, Bitcoin is maintaining its value throughout these turbulent times.\n\nSource: CNN Money']"
02/11/2016,"['The bitcoin community can\'t even agree on whether it\'s breaking up.\n\nLast month, Mike Hearn—an ex-Googler and one of the biggest names working on the software underpinning bitcoin—made more than a few headlines when he called the digital currency ""a failed experiment."" He not only parted ways with the bitcoin community. He sold all his bitcoin. He said he was fed up because the bitcoin system—software that runs across a vast network independent machines spread across the globe—was ""completely controlled by just a handful of people"" and ""on the brink of technical collapse.""\n\nHearn had been part of a group trying to change the bitcoin software so it could avoid that ""technical collapse,"" and this group ran into fierce opposition from that ""handful of people"" at the heart of the bitcoin community—i.e. other core developers with different opinions on the future of the digital currency. He called it ""open civil war.""\n\nBitcoin is designed to operate as a democracy. This is how things are supposed to work.\n\n""When parts of the community are viciously turning on the people that have introduced millions of users to the currency, you know things have got really crazy,"" he said, referring to bitcoin company Coinbase being banned from the bitcoin website and removed from discussion groups. He also complained of denial-of-service attacks against Coinbase and others, while The New York Times reported that some developers had received death threats.\n\nBut others in this Hearn\'s group (which no longer includes Hearn) insist that this is not a civil war, that bitcoin is not splitting up. They say the debate over the software is a natural part of the democratic process that drives the development of the bitcoin system. ""Bitcoin is not having a crisis. It\'s having an election,"" says Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, a very well funded startup based in San Francisco. ""The [prevailing] mental model for what\'s going on is a split, a divide in the community. But the right model is an election.""\n\nArmstrong has self-serving reasons for saying this. He runs one of the world\'s largest bitcoin exchanges, a place where you can trade all sorts of fiat currencies for the digital currency. He definitely doesn\'t want anyone thinking bitcoin has failed. On Wednesday, he and his company called reporters to Coinbase\'s HQ just to spread that message. But he raises a good point—denial-of-service attacks and death threats notwithstanding. Bitcoin is designed to operate as a democracy, and indeed, it\'s deep into a major election. This is pretty much how things are supposed to work. Sure, the project needs a better governance structure, and the election tactics got out of hand at times. But, well, this is the internet. When a technology is still maturing, these things happen. People forget that when the internet itself first entered the mainstream, it was the Wild West too.\n\nBuilding Blocks\n\nThe rub is that Armstrong\'s camp believes that if it loses the election, the bitcoin network will gradually slow to a crawl. Or, in Hearn\'s words, it will collapse. At issue is the size of the ""blocks"" that identify transactions on the network. Armstrong and those who agree with him argue that the community must increase the block size to accommodate the increasingly large number of transactions on the network. ""Assuming that transaction volume keeps going up, transactions will get increasingly unreliable at random times. That\'s just not a good situation,"" says Gavin Andresen, an independent software developer who is also part of this camp and appeared via video at Coinbase\'s event to make the same case.\n\nIn other words, if the block size doesn\'t increase, they say, bitcoin is screwed. As Armstrong points out, the bitcoin network currently does about seven transactions per second. PayPal does 100. And Visa does 4,000. ""Bitcoin is going to have to continue to scale,"" he says.\n\nThe result of the election won\'t have an immediate impact on individuals who use bitcoin today—let alone the average consumer, who has yet to embrace the digital currency. But it could impact the long-term future of bitcoin, a technology that promises to significantly reinvent how we deal with money. The hope is that this vast network of machines will let us move money from place to place as easily as we send texts and emails.\n\nAs it stands, few people actually hold the bitcoin digital currency and use it to buy stuff. Overstock.com, the largest online retailer to adopt bitcoin, says it accounts for less than 0.1 percent of sales. But even if the average consumer never adopts the currency, bitcoin remains enormously important. It can serve as an open and inexpensive way for businesses and banks and other organizations to move money behind the scenes. It\'s like a Visa payment network that\'s controlled not by Visa, but by the people—one that is open to all and that can move money more cheaply and efficiently. That\'s something we should all care about.\n\nLife in the Mines\n\nThe bitcoin network is driven by what are called miners, specialized computers that run the bitcoin software. In exchange, the people who run these miners are automatically paid in bitcoin. That\'s their immediate incentive. But they also have an interest in expanding the network and keeping it running smoothly. Otherwise, those payments will dry up. In this big election, they must weigh both those incentives.\n\nWhat people like Armstrong and Andresen are trying to do is change the software that runs all those miners, so that bitcoin can accommodate a larger block size. They believe this is the best way to ensure the health of the network. But others are intent on maintaining the status quo—some because of ideology, others because of money. Some people don\'t want bitcoin to stray from its original mission and fall into the hands of big businesses. Others think there are better ways of accommodating more transactions per second. And, it seems, certain miners are worried their bitcoin payments will drop if they make a switch.\n\nCould Armstrong and crew lose this election? Well, they already lost once. That\'s part of the reason Hearn quit. Last summer, together with Andresen, Hearn proposed new software called Bitcoin XT that would increase the block size. And the community rejected it. Now, Andresen and others are proposing much the same thing with something called Bitcoin Classic.\n\nWhy do they think things will go better this time? They\'re not trying to raise the block size quite as high as they did with Bitcoin XT. They\'re proposing a one megabyte increase, not several megabytes. And that\'s significant—mostly because of the Great Firewall of China.\n\nAligning Incentives\n\nGavin Andresen and others released the official version of Bitcoin Classic on Wednesday morning, and Coinbase was among those who loaded the code onto its machines. Now, we\'ll have to wait to see if the larger miner community adopts it. Basically, 75 percent of all miners must adopt Bitcoin Classic for the larger block size to take effect. If that threshold is reached, all other miners will have a month to adopt the new block size. If they don\'t, they will indeed split from the larger whole—at least in part.\n\nPeople like Armstrong and Andresen don\'t think a real split will happen. If the network switches to the larger block size, they say, minors who stick to the smaller size will see the value of their bitcoin payments drop. This is basically because they won\'t have as many others backing their transactions. ""The economic incentives are there for the blockchain to align on one version,"" Armstrong says. In other words, he thinks everything will work out just fine, and the bitcoin network will accommodate an ever increasing number of transactions.\n\nBut there\'s a wild card in the mix: China. As Hearn pointed out, two Chinese operations control about 50 percent of the network\'s mining power, and they\'re reluctant to adopt the larger block size. ""[They] refuse to switch to any competing product, as they perceive doing so as \'disloyalty\'—and they’re terrified of doing anything that might make the news of a \'split\' and cause investor panic,"" he wrote. ""They have chosen instead to ignore the problem and hope it goes away.""\n\nWork Slowdown\n\nThat said, others view the situation a bit differently. For Jeff Garzik, another longtime bitcoin developer in the same camp as Armstrong and Andresen, the smaller block size increase proposed by Bitcoin Classic could be more palatable to Chinese miners.\n\nOne of the chief issues with Chinese miners, as Hearn pointed out, is that they\'re behind China\'s Great Firewall—the system that filters Internet content according to the dictates of the local government. This means Chinese miners can\'t communicate with the rest of the Internet as quickly as other miners, and if the block size is increased too much, things will slow even more. In certain situations, that could mean they lose out on bitcoin payments.\n\nSituations arise a few times a day, Garzik says, in which miners compete to complete a particular transaction. If the block size increases too much, the Chinese won\'t be able to hold their own in these situations. ""If you increase the size too much, that potentially disadvantages the people on the other side of that divide,"" he says. ""There\'s a direct monetary impact.""\n\nYes, even if Bitcoin Classic is adopted, its two megabyte block size will eventually become a problem too, as the network continues to expand. Then we\'ll need another increase, say Armstrong and Andresen. And that could mean that China becomes a bottleneck once again.\n\nBut Garzik says the power structure of the miners is always shifting. Though China controls a majority of the mining power today, that may not be the case in the future. Chinese miners always will be at a disadvantage because of the Firewall. But situations where block size can affect their money-making prospects are relatively rare. And they will have other incentives to move with the rest of the community.\n\nGarzik recently visited China as he builds a new bitcoin company, Bloq, and he believes the country holds enormous potential. ""What I see is a very vibrant community that very much wants to connect with the West,"" he says, ""and very much interact with the rest of the bitcoin community.""\n\nArmstrong compares bitcoin\'s ongoing fracas to the current presidential election. Yes, the election gets heated. Yes, there is mudslinging. But that\'s part of democracy. In the end, we elect a president and our government rolls on. ""Even if it looks like there\'s lot of name calling and there\'s a big food fight, in an election there\'s an important difference: one thing wins in the end,"" he says. ""The presidential election that\'s happening might look pretty messy. But I think that people would say that the process is working.""\n\nIt\'s not a bad analogy. Yes, sometimes we elect people who end up doing more harm than good. That very well could happen with the current election. But then along comes another.', 'There are three traditional ways for malware and viruses to generate bitcoins for their creators. Direct theft of private keys from bitcoin wallets, parasitic bots that mine bitcoin with stolen processing power, and Ransomware that encrypts files and demands a bitcoin payment to restore access.\n\nStealing private keys is often accomplished with a computer virus. This type of malware emerged in early 2011, using keyloggers and other classic techniques to find data that looks like a bitcoin wallet private key, or a whole wallet data file full of them.\n\nThe largest attack of this kind was conducted with the Pony botnet in 2014, which stole a variety of personal information from millions of users. The criminals behind the malicious code got away with about US$220,000 worth of various cryptocurrencies, from its many victims.\n\nA second type of attack also emerged in 2011. Using the idle processing power of infected computers, this new breed of trojan actually mined bitcoins. The ZeroAccess botnet infected as many as 1.9 million machines with the code. A more recent attack variety affected Android phones, and was distributed to over 10,000 users through the Google Play store in 2014.\n\n- Microsoft\n\nAlthough newer, the third attack type has been on the rise lately. Instead of searching for private keys or mining bitcoins, ransomware encrypts a victim’s hard drive. One particularly bad strain of ransomware, Cryptowall, actively targeted US victims in 2014, extorting between $200 and $10,000 in bitcoin for decrypting the files. The thefts prompted the FBI to issue a public warning about the scheme in June 2015.\n\nA McAfee labs Threat Report revealed a 165% rise in new ransomware during the first quarter of 2015, after having stated previously that “ransomware will evolve its methods of propagation, encryption, and the targets it seeks.”\n\n- The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)\n\nA fourth type of bitcoin-thieving malware was recently created. This new variety hijacks the infected device’s Windows clipboard, and replaces bitcoin addresses as they’re copy and pasted.\n\nTrojan.Coinbitclip is the first instance of this new type of attack, discovered by Symantec on Feb 2nd. It was designed to watch for a bitcoin address copied using the clipboard, and replaces it with one of it’s own, bypassing any protection from multi-signature and hardware wallets.\n\nWhile clipboard hijacking is not a new concept, this is the first time it has been found replacing bitcoin addresses.\n\n- Symantec\n\nThis clever little invader carries with it a large list of bitcoin addresses and chooses the closest match when making the switch, making it harder to spot the switch. In the sample Symantec observed, there were 10,000 Bitcoin addresses stored in the code. The end result is that copying and pasting a payment address can easily trick you into sending your coins to the malware\'s creator.\n\nConsidering that the risk level of this trojan is ""very low,” Symantec claims that it is ""easy"" to remove. The security company has already created and deployed the first threat definition for their software, which will detect and remove Trojan.Coinbitclip.\n\nHowever, it won\'t be long before such a simple trojan is modified for other operating systems and delivery methods. The threat currently infects PCs running Windows 7 or older version of the Windows operating system, and has been delivered through a third-party tool for the popular digital trading card game Hearthstone.\n\nThe online collectible card game, developed by Blizzard Entertainment, is free-to-play with optional purchases both inside the game and elsewhere online.\n\nHearthstone was released in March 2014, and the following day it became the number one most downloaded app in 34 countries, including the US. By November 2015, the game claimed more than 40 million registered players.\n\nThe game also has a robust aftermarket of sorts, from which players can download third-party applications and files to help them in the game. One such underground program called the “Hearthstone hack tool v2.1 -Gold and Dust Generator” was widely advertised on Hearthstone forums as a simple program that would help players build wealth. Unsurprisingly, the program didn\'t work as advertised but delivered the trojan instead.\n\nAs attacks like this evolve, web security companies like McAfee, Symantec, and Kaspersky each scramble to deploy countermeasures. Although competitors Microsoft and McAfee collectively list 1,073 threats containing the word bitcoin, they don\'t have this particular threat solution listed yet. Neither did the rest of the top 10 largest vendors at the time of this writing.\n\nTo date, there is no foolproof solution to protect bitcoin-stealing malware from swapping out bitcoin addresses on computers and smartphones. However, this new threat demonstrates that there is a need for such a solution.\n\nCurrently, most wallets have address books which store previous recipient addresses. Senders can choose one by simply selecting the associated user from a list or drop down menu. The drawback is that this only works for recurring beneficiaries.\n\nServices such as Keybase and Onename can broaden the database of addresses. These third party services can also automatically check them against known compromised addresses.\n\nThere are also several anti-malware software suites that can help fight malware attacks. There are also many basic security best practices to use, such as a firewall to block all incoming and outgoing connections, disabling AutoPlay, removing unnecessary services and never downloading files from untrusted sources that could prevent malware attacks. Specifically for bitcoin wallets, the official Bitcoin wallet security page provides some great resources.', 'Zimbabwe, 1995, according to photographer. Image: Flickr/damien_pharrell\n\nFor Bitcoin evangelists, every economic disaster is also an opportunity to, well, promote Bitcoin. From Greece to South Africa, Bitcoin has been vaunted as a technology with world-saving power, either by replacing a broken money system wholesale or just making it easier for people living in the West to send money back to their families at home.\n\nBut a new UN working paper disagrees with the boosterism around Bitcoin\'s place in developing or destabilized economies. According to the report, written by independent researcher Brett Scott for the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, most Bitcoin startups are just too damn libertarian to take up the altruistic challenge of helping less privileged people. In other words, Bitcoin is filled with people who believe in individualist, market-led solutions to collective problems of public import.\n\n""It is one thing to use Bitcoin to provide a counter-power to the powerful cartels of banks in nations like the United States, but in a country like Zimbabwe the real need may be to strengthen the integrity of the banking system, something that can only be achieved by hard, long-term political battles,"" Scott writes.\n\n""Escaping weak local institutions might help individual people, but does little to empower the broader social majority who remain reliant on the existing systems,"" he adds.\n\nFor many, ""money without government"" translates directly to ""money without politics""\n\n\n\nThe issue, Scott notes, is the long-standing tendency within the Bitcoin community to see the Bitcoin protocol as an apolitical, automated entity. For many, ""money without government"" translates directly to ""money without politics.""\n\nBut, as the recent and heated debate over a code change that would allow the Bitcoin network to handle more traffic shows, this is untrue. The debate has ruffled the feathers of large Chinese players who feel they would be disadvantaged by the change, and prompted one of the Bitcoin\'s most senior cheerleaders—former developer Mike Hearn—to brand the whole thing a failure. Some spin-off debates have even asked whether Bitcoin is a democracy, or a developer-led autocracy. The underlying message is that Bitcoin developers and users inevitably bring their politics into the realm of code and protocol.\n\nBut there is some hope that Bitcoin\'s underlying blockchain technology, the publicly viewable distributed ledger that records every Bitcoin transaction, might actually help developing economies, Scott writes. For example, ""smart contracts,"" really just self-executing code based in the blockchain, could track weather patterns and automatically release cryptocurrency funds to farmers who need it most in dry areas. The Ethereum project, a distributed coding platform powered by its own blockchain and currency, also shows promise, according to Scott.\n\nBut for now, the Bitcoin blockchain really solves one problem: proving that somebody owns something. That makes the blockchain a limited-use tool, although potentially disruptive in areas like recording land registry claims for posterity in countries with weakly enforced property rights.

As the Bitcoin blocksize debate has caused disunity and discord amongst the bitcoin community, a fair amount of BTC money is flooding across into ETH.\n\nThat said the market cap of Ethereum has breached the $350 million dollar market cap putting it second in CryptoCompare’s market capitalisation rankings overtaking Ripple and Litecoin.\n\nSo what has caused this rampant price rise. Although there hasn’t been a major news piece to drive the price, there has been a trickle of minor announcements that have shown increasing adoption and approval of Ethereum and its underlying technology – from a gradual approach towards Homestead at 80% complete, Consensys releases, R3’s continued support of Ethereum, ubuntu phone collaboration and the Bitnation constitution being coded in Ethereum.\n\nThe flood and price rise can be seen in the numbers with over 60,000 BTC trading across from Bitcoin to Ether in a 24 hour period. Comparing this to Bitcoin USD volume at roughly 80,000-100,000 BTC in a 24 hour period for the past week you have a significant trend in force.\n\nThis upswing has dragged along the other fiat trading pairs increasing their volumes. Conversely to Bitcoin this seems to being led by the Euro pair pulling in most of the fiat volume – with EUR 400k compared to USD 100k. This is due to Kraken exchange dominance in Ether fiat trading and a European bent to the recent confidence.\n\nAs for the community aspect Ethereum has 8,000 subscribers on Reddit and 24,000 twitter followers – the trend has been upwards meaning it has been gaining momentum.\n\nThere have also been reports of messages being sent to bitcoin subscribers on reddit pushing and compelling them to look at ethereum as an alternative to bitcoin.\n\nAlthough the price rise has no clear reasons – the underlying force is a hedge from bitcoin users seeing potential and a smaller yet growing trend of fiat users not wanting to miss out.\n\nCharts and Data Analysis Courtesy of CryptoCompare.com', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Well if you’re in Hungary’s capital Budapest you’re in luck if you hold some bitcoin.\n\nIt is the latest city where you can use the virtual currency to pay your cab driver.\n\nBitcoin is known for several things – the volatility of its value against traditional currencies and fact that the electronic transactions are anonymous, which has led to accusations it could be used for criminal activity.\n\nAndrás L?wy is the chief executive of COinPAY, the company which has set up the taxi pay scheme. He told euronews he is just trying to be helpful: “Our company wants those with bitcoins to be able to spend them on services, products, in shops, because it creates business and it helps those who need that service.”\n\nL?wy believes this kind of legitimate commercial use of bitcoins should help improve its reputation.\n\nFor now it works in 580 cabs in Budapest. Csaba Horváth, the managing director of Budapest Taxi, does not think many of their passengers will be using bitcoins to pay but didn’t want to miss out: “We believe that we have to grab every opportunity that comes along, to take advantage of any innovation, and if one of those becomes very successful, we can say we were the first to use it.”\n\nIn reality few Hungarians have even heard of bitcoin but it is estimated there is about 25 million euros worth of the virtual currency held by its citizens.\n\nEuronews correspondent Andrea Hajagos said: “In Budapest there are already several bitcoin cash dispensers. Many have criticised this sort of payment saying it’s linked to the black economy, but others point out it is very innovative.”', 'Nozomi Hayase PhD, is a writer covering issues of freedom of speech, transparency and decentralized movements.\n\nIn this article, she argues bitcoin\'s divisive scalability debate should be seen as just another phase in the growth for the digital currency project.\n\nThe prolonged scaling issue has turned into what some have been calling bitcoin\'s existential crisis.\n\nAs proposals for alternative solutions to Bitcoin Core’s roadmap were put forward and Bitcoin Classic gained traction, the divergence in technical approach has devolved into a heated debate. Emotionally charged disputes on Reddit and Twitter with censorship and personal attacks have divided the community.\n\nThis split over the protocol harkens back to differences in views that arose at the onset of this technology between economists and those with computer science backgrounds. The former often denounced it as a deflationary currency with fundamental flaws, while the latter tended to praise it and tout its significant potential.\n\nSince its inception, the question of what bitcoin is has continuously evolved. As it began to mature, bitcoin slowly shed layers of skin, helping people view the technology on its own merits.\n\nPerhaps, this recent block size debate marks another phase in bitcoin\'s development, calling for an even deeper understanding of Satoshi\'s invention.\n\nUnprecedented security model\n\nAt its genesis, bitcoin was envisioned to be a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash. In the seminal white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto stated it would allow ""online payments be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"".\n\nThe core invention solves the problem of double-spend using ""a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions"". Satoshi outlined how the implementation of this required ""hash-based proof-of-work forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work"".\n\nIn a nutshell, bitcoin is a peer-to-peer security network that has never existed before. This new security backed by mathematics enables censorship resistance and monetary sovereignty, making it a globally seamless network, unlike any legacy financial system.\n\nAt the Hong Kong Scaling Bitcoin conference, developer Andrew Poelstra explained the security assumption that bitcoin lives in an adversarial environment. He noted how the possibility of individuals acting selfishly and taking advantage of others needs to be factored into designing governance. Bitcoin Core software contributor Peter Todd also emphasized the necessity of thinking in adversarial terms when creating incentives for decentralization.\n\nUpon this security assumption, the architecture of bitcoin governance was built in a manner that reduces the probability of attackers and encourages nodes to stay honest.\n\nThis was made possible through a combination of game theory, a careful calculation of risk and reward and a balance of supply and demand. This governance includes a 1MB block size limit that was set by Satoshi as a temporary security measure to prevent spam attacks until the network grew.\n\nGrowing towards its limits\n\nThe cumulative knowledge of computer science has resulted in the creation of the incentive structure as it exists now. In this, bitcoin possesses economics of scarcity with its monetary design of finite supply. For those who haven’t engaged fully in this security assessment, what they often see is a currency mimicking a gold-like commodity.\n\nWith this image of digital gold, bitcoin made its public debut. ""Currency as its first app"" became like a promo code for this groundbreaking invention, and speculators and investors alike flocked around this new asset-based currency.\n\nAt its young age, bitcoin was recognized for its capacity to become a good store of value. Yet, for those who wish to see wider consumer adoption and it to be used for everyday transactions, realization of the promise of peer-to-peer electronic cash still seemed a bit out of reach.\n\nIn 2015, bitcoin was shown to be the best performing currency globally. Now, with the increase of users and transactions, the average block size has moved closer to Satoshi’s 1MB limit.\n\nAs the fear of reaching this limit grew, alternative proposals for addressing the issue emerged, such as Bitcoin XT, which required fundamental changes to the protocol. Core developers responded to this hard fork attempt with concerns about the security trade-off that such a measure would bring.\n\nThe gap of understanding of this technology that manifested in the earlier days as a divide between economists and computer scientists seemed to have resurfaced in these block size debates. This schism recently widened with former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn’s \'ragequit\' and his farewell letter that declared bitcoin a failure.\n\nToken of security\n\nWhat does this crisis really mean to the bitcoin community and beyond?\n\nThere is a Chinese proverb in which a crisis is understood as ""an opportunity to ride the dangerous wind"". This block size debacle is perhaps providing us an opportunity to better understand the core of this invention and make informed decisions at this pivotal moment in the technology’s development.\n\nBitcoin is more than just currency. It is more than a store of value or medium of exchange. Its underlying technology, the blockchain is an immutable ledger. Its unprecedented security of distributed trust requires incentive for participants to work honestly according to the rule of consensus.\n\nUnlike large data center-based ledgers, this blockchain can’t exist without bitcoin being used as a reward for miners to maintain its decentralization.\n\nAll things considered, the current scaling challenge is revealing that we don’t actually fully have currency as bitcoin’s first app yet. As the technology’s foundation is built out, what we are seeing is the bitcoin token, critical for the security system, now tussling with its own nature as a medium of exchange.\n\nIn this context, what does this challenge of increasing transaction capacity present? It may indicate how important it is for us not to conflate two distinct problems. Bitcoin\'s peer-to-peer network is used as a solution to solve the problem of double spending. Here, its economics is designed in service to security to create, store and move value without having a central point of control.\n\nOn top of this security model, currency as a first application can be created to solve the challenge of becoming a medium of exchange that functions as transactional currency at a large scale.\n\nPlatform for permissionless innovation\n\nOnce we understand the principles required to maintain this technology’s core, we can engage in the efforts to make currency bitcoin\'s first application, without compromising its underlying security.\n\nCEO of Ciphrex and longtime contributor to Bitcoin Core Eric Lombrozo suggested building layers on top of the base of cryptographic proof.\n\nHe pointed out his belief that this approach is similar to how the Internet was built:\n\n""For bitcoin, at the bottom level we have this consensus layer. The consensus layer is actually not a network protocol at all. It’s actually a set of cryptographic commitment structures, which allow you to construct proofs that things happened according to certain rules. This is something that allows everyone to eventually come to agreement on what the state of the network is.""\n\nA robust P2P transfer network can be built on varied economic structures, in added layers compatible with, and in a manner that supports, the underlying consensus rules.\n\nAnother breakthrough innovation called Segregated Witness has recently emerged that could roll out concrete steps in this direction. Introduced by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream engineer Pieter Wuille, \'SegWit\' separates signatures from transactions and resolves a prevailing problem of transaction malleability. It also has a positive side effect in scaling by increasing bitcoin\'s block size capacity without increasing the block size limit.\n\nSegWit Testnet has now been deployed and is an essential component in Bitcoin Core’s roadmap as a soft fork, which brings changes without breaking the existing consensus rules and is considered to be a much safer approach.\n\nAll this, combined with sidechains or off-chain scalability solutions like the Lightning Network, makes creative solutions available that could help bitcoin grow horizontally, while staying true to its unique decentralized nature.\n\nAfter seven years of existence, in spite of wild waves of volatility and media frenzies claiming the death of the cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been moving forward without disruption. If we enter this scaling challenge as an opportunity to solidify consensus, we may all be able to enjoy the fruits of what this amazing invention can truly offer.\n\nThe permissionless innovation that the platform of consensus provides invites us to build as many diverse applications and networks as possible. We are now at the dawn of a new era of finance brought about by cryptographic trust.\n\nOpportunity visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Satoshi originally described an alert system that would notify SPV nodes when an invalid block had been detected by a full node, but the idea has been somewhat impractical to implement up to this point. According to Bitcoin Core Contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo, the upcoming Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork will make Satoshi’s vision of improved SPV security a real possibility.\n\nLombrozo discussed the concept of fraud proofs, which can be used to efficiently prove the existence of invalid blocks, on a recent episode of epicenter Bitcoin\n\nWhy Does Bitcoin Need Fraud Proofs?\n\nAt one point during his interview, Eric Lombrozo was asked directly about the concept of fraud proofs by Epicenter Bitcoin Co-Host Sébastien Couture. In his response, Lombrozo explained why this new feature could be useful for SPV nodes:\n\n“If there was a way to have fraud proofs, it would improve the security [of SPV nodes] because it would only require one whistleblower on the entire network to notice that a block is invalid and all SPV nodes could ignore that block.”\n\nWhile SPV nodes are useful for operating a thin client on less powerful devices, such as a smartphone, they don’t offer the best security because transactions are not completely validated locally. Lombrozo discussed this issue during the interview:\n\n“Right now, if you’re running an SPV client, you get a block that confirms a transaction and, unless you are able to validate the block, you just accept the transaction’s confirmation because the rest of the network seems to think it’s okay. But, of course, miners could be cheating or they could be running buggy software. That has actually happened before. Miners are not validating correctly. And then, SPV clients are going to see confirmations that are not actually real.”\n\nAn example of what can occur when miners are not validating blocks correctly took place on July 4, 2015. After a soft fork for BIP 66 was activated, a small miner mined an invalid block. Although this would have been noticed if other miners had been performing full validation on blocks, it turned out that around 50 percent of the miners were SPV mining. As a result, more blocks were built on top of that first invalid block. The invalid chain was eventually orphaned; however, the whole ordeal costed some miners roughly $50,000 in revenue, while also temporarily forcing some Bitcoin users to wait 30 confirmations before accepting a transaction as real.\n\nChecking That a Block is Invalid\n\nLombrozo also noted that receiving a proof that a block is invalid would be easy for SPV nodes because the information would have low resource requirements and would only require one full node on the network to detect the issue. Lombrozo explained:\n\n“A potential fix would be if it was possible to make it so if — even if proving the block is invalid is expensive (it requires downloading the whole blockchain and then checking it) — maybe checking that the block is invalid could be made cheap. So you could have a very short proof that demonstrates that the block is invalid, and if you could create this, that means it would only take one node on the entire network to construct this proof and propagate it. And then all the nodes would know immediately to ignore this.”\n\nFraud proofs would essentially allow SPV nodes to gain better security while not giving up much at all in terms of their lightweight functionality.\n\nFraud Proofs Don’t Make SPV Nodes Perfect\n\nAlthough fraud proofs appear to be a serious breakthrough in SPV security, issues still remain with these types of clients when compared to full nodes. Eric Lombrozo explained some of the downsides and tradeoffs of fraud proofs during his interview:\n\n“There’s a significant problem with this, which is it requires extreme censorship resistance. For instance, if you’re connected through your ISP and your ISP decides to block these messages, there could be potential attacks there. So it requires more security assumptions, but on the other hand, it does mean that the incentives model shifts more towards people actually wanting to validate correctly because it’s harder for someone to get away with it. So just the knowledge that if you try to do this it would be harder to get away with, it could make it so people are less inclined to try it.”\n\nAlthough fraud proofs still have problems that need to be sorted out, Lombrozo is bullish on their usefulness in a future version of simplified payment verification on the Bitcoin network. This sort of functionality is made possible by the upcoming Segregated Witness soft fork, but Lombrozo claimed, “For the first release of SegWit, we won’t be doing fraud proofs right away. This is something that is potentially for some later release.”']"
02/12/2016,"['For the last year, the Bitcoin community has been embroiled in what is, on one level, a technical debate over how to upgrade the network to accommodate growing transaction volume.\n\nThe fighting reached a head in mid-January, when a prominent developer declared the currency a failure and left Bitcoin. It promptly lost about 15% of its value and hasn\'t recovered.\n\nWhat has been called “the block size debate” (referring to the megabyte limit for each group of transactions processed) has now grown into a power struggle, with the group of volunteer developers working on the protocol splitting into several camps.\n\n“This is not really about block size,” says core developer Eric Lombrozo. “It’s really about the control of the protocol.”\n\nWhat seems like a technical debate on the surface is actually deeply informed by human politics and personality differences. But because major players in the Bitcoin ecosystem are based in China, the outcome of this dispute in the Western Bitcoin community is also being influenced by cultural gaps between the West and China of which they may be only vaguely aware.\n\nOn Wednesday, one of the new teams, which has christened itself Bitcoin Classic and is supported by Coinbase, one of the most well-funded companies in the space (the original team is called Bitcoin Core), released a new version of the software making another attempt at an upgrade, which Lombrozo called “a tactic to shift power away from the Core devs.”\n\nHowever, by Thursday morning, two dozen people representing almost 20 Bitcoin companies, many of which would be directly affected by the software change (and accounting for more than half of the network powering Bitcoin) formed a group called the Bitcoin Roundtable and released a statement effectively rejecting the new software, at least for the time being.\n\nIn fact, one of the very companies listed on the Bitcoin Classic website as if it were a supporter, HaoBTC, disavowed this new version of the software in an email. Chief strategy officer Eric Mu wrote, “We did use the word ?? (translated as ‘support’), in both the CEO\'s statement and verbally when meeting with Classic lead developer Mr. Jeff Garzik in Beijing. However, that is by no means to say that we will switch our mining power to Classic.”\n\nMining is the activity that sustains the network — and it distinguishes Bitcoin from previous Internet applications. Bitcoin is often described as a way to transfer money peer-to-peer, without a bank or financial institution acting as a middleman. For this reason, the Bitcoin community likes to describe the currency as “trustless,” meaning that a user does not have to trust a third party such as a bank to ensure the proper processing of a transaction. However, using Bitcoin does in fact require trusting a collective third party: the miners who process the transactions by recording the most recent transactions onto a public ledger containing every Bitcoin transaction in history, copies of which are kept on computers around the world.\n\nAs David Evans, a lecturer at University of Chicago Law School wrote in a 2014 paper, “the fact that the public ledger is decentralized — so there is not a bank or a government acting as the intermediary — may have interesting political or social value to some. But from the standpoint of considering economic efficiency there is still an intermediary, just a very different sort of one.” He says Bitcoin is much more complicated than a typical open source project because it involves managing and incentivizing a large network of laborers — the miners — to process the transactions.\n\nThis is the problem that competing Bitcoin teams are running up against: no one camp can very easily wrest power away from the other without the support of the miners — and about three-quarters of their current network power is located in China.\n\nBut according to those who participate in both the Western and Chinese Bitcoin communities, the way the West has framed the issues over the last year is not the way China has, even as the West has looked to its Eastern counterparts to weigh in.\n\nBobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, is one of the few people in the Bitcoin community who witnesses these cultural variations regularly. Lee, who was educated in the United States but is now based in Shanghai, is also one of the rare bilingual English-Chinese Bitcoin entrepreneurs and has interpreted at international Bitcoin conferences. “I’m at the 90-degree angle,” he says. “I see this line, and I see that line. One group thinks one way, the other group thinks another way. They’re orthogonal.”\n\nIn the English-speaking Bitcoin world, he says, the debate boils down to two issues. First, how should Bitcoin be governed — by dictators, as a democracy or as a republic? And second, which is more important — keeping Bitcoin decentralized or allowing for more transactions and users? The camp in favor of keeping the block size smaller for as long as possible (currently at 1MB), mostly represented by Bitcoin Core, believes doing so will allow even small-time miners to be included in maintaining the network, keeping it from being controlled by a few large entities that have the computing power to accommodate larger blocks. (Also, many in this group support other solutions, most notably one called Segregated Witness, that will allow more transactions to go through without having to raise the block size right now.) The other side, such as Bitcoin Classic, advocates for increasing the block size sooner, to 2MB, to accommodate for growth and also because smaller blocks may artificially inflate the fees required to get transactions processed in the network, cutting into one of the major advantages that Bitcoin has over other payment systems — the fact that it’s cheaper than payment methods such as credit cards.\n\nBut Lee says about these questions of decentralization versus scale, “this kind of stuff, the Chinese people don’t care about. It’s not in the vocabulary. Chinese people don’t grow up thinking about democracy and decentralization and individual freedom and liberty.”\n\nLee breaks down the Chinese Bitcoin community into five main constituencies: ASIC chip manufacturers (an ASIC is a chip designed for a specific purpose such as mining Bitcoin; these manufacturers are similar to Intel), machine assemblers (similar to Dell), the operators of mining machines (like data centers), mining pool operators who aggregate individual miners to spread the risk and create predictable income for each, and finally the owners of the machines themselves, many of which buy these machines as investment to make a return. He says while the West wrings its hands over how to upgrade the network, the Chinese Bitcoin community’s attitude is, “Don’t bother me, I’m trying to make my money here.”\n\nReferring to how Bitcoin developers have split up into competing teams, Lee says, “Chinese are used to this one power system — one political system, one political power. So, the Core team was the original political party, and now there are people coming up to challenge them, but the Chinese are like, ‘Let’s go with the incumbent. As long as the incumbent delivers something reasonable, we’ll go with it. We’re not going to jump ship and vote and create a new political party for ideological reasons.’” (Lee signed the Bitcoin Roundtable statement released Thursday morning that effectively rejected the Classic proposal.)\n\nCiting Chinese proverbs that encourage people to “bend with the grass,” Lee says, “in Chinese culture, if you stick out, you’re the one that gets run over. You don’t want to be the one that speaks up. You want to be in the crowd, anonymous.”\n\nThe opinion of Jack Liao, CEO of Bitexchange and LightningASIC, two China-based Bitcoin companies, illustrates this partiality toward the incumbent: “I prefer to stay with 1 MB,” he says. “I choose Segregated Witness” — the Core team’s proposed solution — “because the Core developer team for the past two years did a great job and I trust them more than the Classic team. The Classic team was made up very quickly in a few months, [but after the 2MB upgrade] they don’t have a plan.”\n\nBitmain, a Chinese mining hardware producer and pool operator, also favors the Core team, although the company made clear its desire to increase the block size. “Increasing the 1MB block size limit is a necessary step towards keeping bitcoin a global system that is both low-cost and directly accessible to all users,” Jacob Smith, a company spokesman, wrote in an email. He also referred to a tweet by the CEO that stated Core was the best team to lead, but that also expressed frustration that it had not yet committed to increasing the block size. “All else being equal, if the current version of Bitcoin Core included a similar 2MB block size increase in their code, we would certainly support them and all the developer talent they have behind them,” Smith concluded.\n\nAnother Chinese and English bilingual Bitcoin community member, Johnson Lau, who lives in Hong Kong, volunteer translates and interprets Bitcoin papers and at conferences and who helped author the Segregated Witness proposal, had similar assessments to Lee’s. “People in China are not very interested in this decentralization thing,” he says. “In Western culture, people tend not to trust authority … but in China they tend to trust.”\n\nIn a follow-up email, he wrote, “they are educated to trust centralized power,” and said a view expressed in an article about Chinese stock market investors was representative: It quoted a Chinese stock market investor who said, ""I bought in because I could see that the government wanted the market to go up and if the government wanted it to happen, well then it would happen.""\n\nOne of the big drivers behind Bitcoin’s early popularity in the United States was its appeal to libertarians, who were drawn to the fact that it is not a state-sponsored currency. However, Lee says the concept of libertarianism doesn’t translate. “Chinese people are very practical, very pragmatic, and the notion of multiple political parties, people who want freedom and anonymity — that’s weird to Chinese people. Some of them want quick profit. They want to gamble and make a return on their investment — and that goes over the head of Westerners. I grew up and went to school in California. When people come home from work or home or school, they’re not thinking, ‘How am I going to day trade my stocks and try to make a quick buck?’ That’s just not in American culture,” whereas it\'s a Chinese social norm, he says.\n\nLau agrees China’s interest in Bitcoin has more to do with the culture’s interest in any hot investment. Noting that the country has seen bubbles in a number of investments ranging from the stock market to postage stamps to agarwood to tea, he says some in the Chinese Bitcoin community are rich people not interested in the concept behind Bitcoin but “are just printing money…. Some people who control a lot of hashing power” — such as 2-3% of the network — “don’t really understand the protocol at all. They don’t really think about what is the reason of mining or why Bitcoin is interesting.”\n\nOver the last year, many have suggested that the miners have much of the power to decide how to resolve the block size question. In fact, Bitcoin Classic proposes an “election,” in which miners “vote” for the version of Bitcoin that they prefer, and once 751 out of 1,000 consecutive blocks are mined indicating support for Classic, it would trigger a 28-day grace period for computers in the Bitcoin network to upgrade to Classic before their software would no longer be compatible with the rest of the network.\n\nBut Lee says, in China, the word “vote” is taboo. “No one votes in China,” he says. “You’ve never grown up or lived in a Communist country, but voting is just — we don’t vote. We let the leaders decide. So the Chinese community, is like, ‘Hey, we’re not going to vote. We let the Core team decide.’\n\n“That’s why there are criticisms, like, ‘Hey, Chinese people, why are you not voting? Why are you being derelict in your responsibilities?’ But the Chinese people, like, ‘What are you talking about? I never knew I had the responsibility to vote. All I cared about was trying to make my money.’”\n\nBecause their main concern is that the core developers not do anything that could harm the price, the Chinese have largely displayed a conservative attitude toward changes.\n\nAdam Back, a developer and cryptographer who has regular contact with the Core developer team and who cofounded Blockstream, a company that also employs a few Core developers, says Bitcoin is supposed to be governed by consensus, which requires that almost everyone must agree. That means changes need to be noncontroversial actions desired by everyone, so the software isn’t split in two, which would likely sink Bitcoin’s value. For that reason, he says the Chinese conservativism works well for Bitcoin.\n\n“We already have political money. That’s where we get quantitative easing and inflation. Bitcoin is supposed to prevent that kind of thing. It’s supposed to be like gold, and it’s supposed to have rules enforced by mathematics. Bitcoin is designed explicitly to prevent political voting to change the currency,” he says.\n\nFor Bitcoin to become a viable alternative to fiat currency, he says it must keep its gold-like properties. “We have U.S. dollars and euros where politicians, in a pinch, might start to pack on hundreds of billions of dollars of inflation. One of the things that attracts people to Bitcoin is that, like gold, it doesn’t have that property. It’s impossible to suddenly create more money or adapt the supply or the properties of the system to political pressures.”\n\nSaying Bitcoin is governed “by a consensus process, where conservative behavior wants to see confidence preserved, to not make dramatic political groups and not make changes unless there’s unanimous approval… If people get dramatic like a U.S. election process, that would actually be quite dangerous for Bitcoin in terms of introducing politics and and seeing the gold-like properties being lost in the mix.”\n\nIt\'s ironic then that the Western Bitcoin community, in its quest to advance the currency, has split into competing factions. But, as Backs says, the Chinese viewpoint is “very compatible with Bitcoin.”', 'The Bitcoin wallet has been cracked. In a research paper, three researchers have claimed that the Bitcoin brain wallet password can be accessed for less than €49.63 euros or about $55.86 US dollars.\n\nBitcoin first arrived in 2008 on a white paper presented on the Internet by the unknown Satoshi Nakamoto. It was released as a cryptocurrency which would allow anonymity in peer-to-peer transactions without geographical border restrictions or government interference.\n\nThe basic premise is that Bitcoin would be utilized via the Bitcoin wallet with a secure password protocol, both for the sake of security and ease of operability for the user. The simple set-up would require an “address”. The Bitcoin address or string in the ID has between 26 and 35 alpha-numeric characters. The owner of the Bitcoin account has a “private key” for use of access and transfer of bitcoin. All of the original account initiation allows the private key can be controlled and allow the ability to change the passcode later.\n\nOnce you have your Bitcoin wallet and buy bitcoin or transfer it, the blockchain or global ledger registers it in real time. Blockchain is considered the future basis for cashless transactions and acts as a notary whether it is banking, mortgage lending, stock transactions or any exchange of value the record keeping.\n\nThe blockchain protocol records every transaction completed into the chain with its value and point of record date. Each block has a hash of the previous block and guarantees the chronology. To attempt a change would require an entire block afterward to be regenerated and record of the change. The ability to exchange assets through a cryptology format or currency with permanent, indisputable record is the value of Bitcoin, and its anonymity is the attraction to Bitcoin fervent supporters. The ability to gain access to your Bitcoin brain wallet is the wrinkle presented by the researchers.\n\nCracking the Bitcoin Brain Wallet\n\nThe Bitcoin wallet operation on the 2-Factor Authentication key security system is where the entry is vulnerable. Ryan Castellucci, White Ops security researcher, found this is not a safe method to create the Bitcoin private key in the Bitcoin brain wallet. He gave proof of its vulnerability with a demonstration last summer at the DEFCON 23 security conference in Las Vegas, USA. He cracked the passkey in front of an audience.\n\nThe two researchers from the University College London stepped in and expanded upon this revelation, and the three cryptology experts explained in their research paper an elliptic curve algorithm known as secp256k1 which is part of the Bitcoin internal composition. Access to this Bitcoin internal component and use of the algorithm allows the hacker 2.5 times faster method of cracking the Bitcoin private keys setup in the Bitcoin Wallet.\n\nHow successful were the researchers? They could use their technique and crack 18,000 passwords. Some of the passphrases were silly simple, such as say “hello to my little friend” or “to be or not to be”. They report in their paper that cracking the Bitcoin passkey has been accomplished by other hackers and reported online.\n\nHow is this achieved and done so cheaply? The researchers used the very available Amazon EC2 web service account from which an attacker would be able to check over 500,000 Bitcoin passwords per second. Since you only pay only for the capacity in the cloud that you use, it would cost about one US dollar spent for the EC2 server to check 17.9 billion password strings. So, to check a trillion passwords, it would cost the attacker only €49.63 or $72. It is very cost efficient theft.\n\nYou may read more about this method in the Speed Optimizations in Bitcoin Key Recovery Attacks research paper, published and hosted on the International Association for Cryptologic Research website.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As the ubiquity of Bitcoin continues to be used in a variety of innovative and interesting ways, often times we forget the convenience the payment system can provide for some of the basics.

A technique used for protecting bitcoin wallets (called a “brain wallet”) seemed to offer a workaround. You use a strong form of cryptography to convert a password that you only keep in your mind—thus reducing vulnerability to malware and other attacks—into something that resists brute force. Brain wallets could thus be stored in the clear (effectively unencrypted) in the bitcoin blockchain, making them always available to an owner without weaknesses that would expose their value to others.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThink again, brainiac! A group of researchers looked into many current brain-wallet implementations and found nothing but moths. Many brain wallets have been pilfered of their value, some within minutes of being added to the blockchain, due to a poor choice of the passwords used to seed more complicated ones. The blockchain is a public record of all bitcoin transactions, and sites and systems increasingly use transactions to include other information. The blockchain can’t be tampered with after about an hour or so following a transaction being baked in, which makes it a perfect permanent repository. It’s also widely replicated around the globe. Bad Passwords Are Bad Passwords The trouble arises from the same issue as with most successful brute-force methods of cracking passwords: You have to choose a strong starting point, no matter how complex that initial password winds up becoming. Many of the tools used to create brain wallets use a simple process–taking a sequence of text a user enters and running it through a one-way cryptographic hashing algorithm (SHA-256), which produces a 256-bit number that can’t be reverse engineered to find the original. This hash is used in a few successive operations to transform into the private-public key pair used for bitcoin addresses and to sign transactions. This kind of hashing is very computationally cheap: Anyone, anywhere can take the same bit of text and hash it quickly and test it against the publicly stored password in the blockchain. The upshot? Use a simple password, which many people have done, and it’s easily cracked despite the appearance of complexity.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCastellucci and his co-authors checked a trillion passwords for $55.86 and recovered 18,000 wallets. Ryan Castellucci of White Ops presented some of his research into this area last August, and is the common link between two new multi-author papers—one out this week and the other available and being presented in two weeks—that dive even deeper into the problems with brain-wallet protection and the techniques which bad guys have used to empty such wallets. Also last August, he released Brainflayer, a tool for automatically testing passwords against brain-wallet encryption keys. The new paper on cracking shows a significant increase in efficiency in testing brain-wallet keys—by a factor of 2.5 since last August—and said it’s possible to test about 17.9 billion passwords for $1 by using Amazon Web Services’ Elastic Computing (EC2) on-demand server offering. He and his co-authors checked a trillion passwords for $55.86 and recovered 18,000 brain wallets. Clever wallet owners had used phrases like “say hello to my little friend” and “dudewheresmycar.” Castellucci told me via email that the problem isn’t the notion of brain wallets, but that many implementations of the password converters or sites that handle them fail to use cryptographic subtleties now widely employed to protect passwords elsewhere. First, they typically don’t use a salt, which is a separate piece of data that is combined with the starting password. Salts used at websites to encrypt passwords are often recovered if a password database gets hacked, but they break one shortcut used by crackers: The crackers can’t compute a password once and match it against all identical occurrences (all uses of “123456”, for instance). Rather, they have to compute passwords combined with the salt. Castellucci suggests an easily remembered piece of data, like someone’s birthdate or email address, would work as a salt because it would be unlikely to be associated in any fashion with the brain wallet. He says that Keybase’s WarpWallet tool allows the use of a salt when creating a brain wallet, and he’d prefer if it were more discouraging about skipping that step. However, he says users should use random generators to create strong passwords “for high-security applications where offline cracking is a concern.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition, most of these conversions rely on a couple of steps to compute SHA256 hashes, which take vanishingly little effort. There are stronger encryption algorithms that impose a “difficulty” requirement, which might reduce the number of calculations by several orders of magnitude without making it more of a pain for the person created the password. The password owner might have to wait one-tenth or half-a-second for their phrase to be converted to unlock a brain wallet, but that would also reduce the ability to launch a trillion attacks for under sixty bucks to potentially just thousands or hundreds of thousands. A salt and a difficult encryption algorithm together dramatically reduce the risk of cracking. LastPass suffered a data breach in 2015 that was embarrassing, but serious consequences were almost entirely averted due to using this design. Drained In Minutes The other paper addresses multiple questions, including how many brain wallets exist in the bitcoin blockchain, and how many of those have been hijacked and emptied. That paper, “The Bitcoin Brain Drain,” will be presented at Financial Cryptography 2016 in two weeks. Castellucci and several colleagues found just 884 wallets in use by anyone other than researchers between September 2011 and August 2015 that had received in total 1,806 Bitcoin (about $100,000). The total wallet count strikes them as surprisingly low. However, they weren’t the first to find them. They note, “We find that all but 21 wallets were drained, usually within 24 hours but often within minutes.” They also identified common parties who drained multiple accounts, indicating the techniques described are in general use. The method they used to find bitwallets involved using Castellucci’s Brainflayer to generate 300 billion passwords from a variety of word lists and sources, as well as using brute-force generated methods for short passwords. Thus, they didn’t start with a list of brain wallets and try to crack them; rather, they identified brain wallets by the password being cracked. The authors conclude that brain wallet use must be rare, but they can’t state it definitively. Castellucci says that he has identified additional brain wallets through owners contacting him (they’d forgotten parts of their passphrases), through public reports of thefts by owners or brags by bitcoin burglars, and some he believes created by researchers in bulk that they weren’t able to crack completely.\n\nadvertisement', 'From socializing to hailing a cab to finding our way around, there’s an app to help. Now, there is a new and improved model that is revolutionizing the way we build scalable applications called a DApp, or decentralized application.\n\nDavid Johnston, CEO of the DApp Fund, predicts in his white paper that “decentralized applications will someday surpass the world’s largest software corporations in utility, user-base, and network valuation due to their superior incentivization structure, flexibility, transparency, resiliency and distributed nature.”\n\nWhat Is a DApp?\n\nA DApp has four characteristics. It must be open source, with all changes made by a majority consensus of the user base. Data must be stored on a public blockchain to avoid a central point of failure. There must be a cryptographic token, referred to as an App Coin, to access the application, and these tokens must be issued according to a standard cryptographic algorithm acting as a proof of the value to nodes that contribute to the application.\n\nBitcoin is an example of a DApp, as it is an open-source token and uses the blockchain, a peer-to-peer and public distributed ledger, to form a trustless system. In fact, Bitcoin is the most popular DApp, as it simplifies many aspects of the traditional financial system, such as transferring money across the world.\n\nAnother application of a DApp is something built as a protocol that uses another blockchain and its own token to function. An example is the Omni Protocol, which “is a protocol built as a layer over Bitcoin that allows you to generate, send, trade, redeem, pay dividends to and make bets with tokens representing any kind of asset,” said Patrick Dugan, who’s a board member of the project, in an interview with Bitcoin.com.\n\nAlternatively, a DApp can be built as an extension to the program. For example the SAFE Network, a peer-to-peer storage network, uses “safecoins” to operate the network. With the SAFE Network, decentralized applications are ensured complete data security, and there are projects such as SAFEpress, similar to WordPress, for the SAFE Network, to help people develop on the Network.\n\nImagine a DApp becoming the computer operating system (OSX or Windows), the programs used on the system (Photoshop, Dropbox), or specialized software that uses the programs, such as a blog that integrates Dropbox. Bitcoin is only the tip of the iceberg of what is possible with this new type of application.\n\nCan App Coins Have Value?\n\nDavid Johnston and team define App Coins in another white paper as “tokens that are native to Decentralized applications that have a digital token associated with their use or monetization.”\n\nTokens can also be developed to behave in a way that Bitcoin cannot, at least for the time being. A Javascript-based programming library called Solidity and another Python-based library called Serpent allow decentralized applications to be built on Ethereum.\n\nIn addition, networks can choose to operate exclusively with their network’s coin, such as the safecoin that powers the SAFE Network. Doing anything on the SAFE Network requires safecoins, and developing on the SAFE Network provides additional value to developers.\n\n“I want to host my apps on SAFE and not have to worry about servers,” said Francis Brunelle to Bitcoin Magazine. Brunelle is an app developer and enthusiastic community member who predicts that “safecoins will be valuable because it will be the only way to buy storage space on the SAFE Network.”\n\nA strong user base on an application can be reinforced through a successful integration of App Coins. An application that rewards contributing developers and lead users with tokens that have a monetary value has an intrinsic advantage over one that does not. Furthermore, a large user base that uses an App Coin presents a barrier to exiting to a competing service with a less popular coin.\n\nFinally, App Coins provide monetary choice as an alternative to both fiat currency and to Bitcoin. People have different opinions on monetary policies, especially with the rise of digital currencies. App Coins can adopt any number of monetary viewpoints and allow everyone a vote to their preferred economic policy.\n\nThe Consumer Future\n\nDApps will likely soon become “consumer apps,” as there are already many in development. The Safe Network decentralizes Internet services and guarantees privacy to all Internet users. Ethereum provides a decentralized application layer and programming language for DApps to be developed.\n\nFactom is a scalable data layer that simplifies big data management record-keeping. Augur is a decentralized prediction market that allows people to forecast events and be rewarded.\n\nAs Johnston says in Johnston’s Law: “Everything that can be decentralized, will be decentralized.”', 'South Korea\'s KB Kookmin Bank is developing a blockchain solution for international remittances with the aim of ushering in ""safer and faster"" foreign exchange services.\n\nFor the initiative, the commercial bank said it is partnering with local bitcoin startup Coinplug to utilise patents the firm holds in the field.\n\nIn statements, KB Kookmin Bank explained that banks currently send overseas remittances via the SWIFT network, which sends payments through an intermediary before they arrive at the beneficiary institution.\n\nHowever, utilising blockchain technology avoids the intermediary, and could reduce costs and result in possible savings for the customer, the bank said.\n\nA bank spokesperson remarked:\n\n""Blockchain technology is a new trend and we are trying to adopt this technology in a low level of data integrity platform.

Transactions can be verified entirely in software, with fewer (or vastly different) trust assumption than previous systems required. And the system is governed differently than previous currency-like technologies--Bitcoin is governed more like an open source project. Factors like these mean that Bitcoin might be able to provide value in new ways, perhaps to contribute to social and governmental goals like financial inclusion.\n\nBut cryptocurrencies also raise concerns with respect to traditional financial and law enforcement policy issues like money laundering and consumer protection.

02/13/2016,"['As the Bitcoin community struggles to reach a broad consensus over how to expand the blockchain’s block size, thus allowing Bitcoin to scale, a pro-Bitcoin attorney has sounded an important alarm: any hard fork of Bitcoin may be illegal, and furthermore, exposes the developers of the newer code to substantial liability.\n\n“The creators of the new software face potential liability and criminal sanctions if they are deemed administrators unless they register with the Feds,” according to Daniel Friedberg, a principal at the law firm of Riddell Williams PS in Seattle. Furthermore, “the implementation of a ‘hard fork’ would require exchanges to differentiate between bitcoin and ‘Bitcoin Classic’ or ‘Bitcoin XT’ Bitcoin, as its customers would inherently have rights to either one or the other.”\n\nIn a recent article on his law firm’s web site, Friedberg points out several legal issues with the looming hard fork – a situation where two incompatible versions of the underlying Bitcoin software coexist until a consensus of miners (transaction processors) switch from the old to new version, thus rendering the old version obsolete.\n\nBitcoin Developers become Money Services Businesses\n\nThe first issue: the potential liability of the software developers working on Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin XT, two contenders for the new fork of the Bitcoin platform code. “Unlike Satoshi, the mysterious creator of the original Bitcoin software who has remained anonymous and therefore outside the reach of law enforcement, the developers of both Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT are publicly named,” Friedberg explains. As a result, “the creators of Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin XT who are deemed administrators would need to register with FinCEN [the US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network] as a Money Service Business (MSB). Failure to register can result in imprisonment of not more than 5 years, as well as civil penalties.”\n\nThis regulatory requirement also throws a wrench into the near-anonymity that Bitcoin users currently enjoy. “An MSB is required to maintain effective anti-money laundering (AML) programs, recordkeeping, and reporting of suspicious activities,” Friedberg continues. “In order to do so, the MSB must know who its customers are.”\n\nAML regulations already require Bitcoin exchanges to know the identities of Bitcoin users. However, in the case of the upcoming hard fork, Bitcoin developers must maintain this information as well to the extent they are deemed administrators as a result of controlling the resulting new currency. “These requirements would require the replacement Bitcoin protocol to maintain the personal identifying information of its users,” Friedberg explains. “The adherence to such requirements will be a large deviation from the current Bitcoin protocol which does not maintain personally identifiable information about its users.”\n\n‘Old’ vs. ‘New’ Bitcoin: Legal Morass\n\nPerhaps the more serious legal issue with the upcoming hard fork results from the fact that it creates two different kinds of Bitcoin, and furthermore, forces owners of the older type to switch to its replacement.\n\nFriedberg points out the problems with such a move. “The implementation of a ‘hard fork’ would require exchanges to differentiate between Bitcoin and ‘Bitcoin Classic’ or ‘Bitcoin XT’ Bitcoin, as its customers would inherently have rights to either one or the other,” Friedberg says. “Exchanges could not mix or intermingle the two, as each has its own rights. In addition, the market price of each coin would likely differ, complicating the decision-making of investors and users.”\n\nThe result: Bitcoin exchanges would open themselves up to both criminal and civil liability. “To the extent that a recipient of Bitcoin expects normal Bitcoin but instead receives ‘Bitcoin Classic’ or ‘Bitcoin XT’ virtual currency due to the actions of a miner, that recipient could argue that the actions of the miner resulted in a dispossession” – ‘dispossession’ being legalese for ‘theft.’\n\nPredictably, the Bitcoin community is generally in disagreement with Friedberg’s legal conclusions. “Anyone who knows what they are doing and uses an updated wallet will clearly know the difference between coins in both forks,” states Redditor klondike\xad\xad_barz (most Bitcoin enthusiasts prefer to remain anonymous). “This is like saying that someone might sue you for giving them USD when they expected Canadian dollars.”\n\nHowever, not all Bitcoin community commenters on Reddit take the same perspective. “An exchange backing a larger block fork that winds up on the losing side would be dead-to-rights guilty of outright fraud for selling fake coins,” admits jphamlore in the same discussion.\n\nThis commenter also references the ‘double your money’ problem I discussed in my previous article on Bitcoin: “There have been threats that such a fork could be attacked by double-spending and rendered worthless,” contrary to the opinion of klondike_barz.\n\nWill Bitcoin Survive the Hard Fork?\n\nIt’s difficult to say at this point in time whether Bitcoin will be able to survive a hard fork to Bitcoin Classic – or any other solution to the block size problem the community may come up with, for that matter.\n\nCertainly, developers of any new fork may register as MSBs to avoid personal liability. How to resolve the problem with ‘old’ vs. ‘new’ Bitcoin, however, is less clear.\n\nOne thing is certain however: Bitcoin’s days operating at the periphery of the law are numbered.\n\nThis article was updated to reflect Friedberg’s clarification that not every hard fork requires registration – only those where the creators are deemed to be administrators by virtue of exercising control over the resulting currency.\n\nDisagree with this article?

The highlighted trend line and support area prevented a downside break this past week. We need to keep an eye on the same and check whether sellers can manage to break it or not. Moreover, the price managed to move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $470 high to $361 low. However, if buyers need to gain control, then they have to clear the 100-day SMA, then only the path will be clear for a move towards the $450 level.\n\nThe next level of interest on the upside if the 100-day MA is breached could be the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $470 high to $361 low. If you are looking to trade in the short-term, then the price is showing a few bullish signs for buyers. There is a bullish trend line formed on the hourly chart via the data feed from Bitstamp, which may act as a buying zone. The price is flirting with the $390 level, which is acting as a short-term resistance area.\n\nIf the price moves or corrects lower from the current levels, then an initial is around the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $380 low to $390 high. However, for buyers the most crucial one is around the bullish trend line area, which is coinciding with the 50% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $380 low to $390 high. Buying dips may be favored in the short term.\n\nLooking at the indicators:\n\nHourly MACD – The hourly MACD is about to change the slope to bearish, which may call for a short-term correction.\n\nRSI (Relative Strength Index) – The hourly RSI is around the extreme overbought levels, again calling for a correction.\n\nIntraday Support Level – $380\n\nIntraday Resistance Level – $390-95\n\nCharts from HitBTC and Bitstamp; hosted by Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The SHA-256 hash of the block header must be less than/equal to the target for the block to be accepted. The inherent probability of performing the tasks that yield the correct hash is very low. Research led by Dr. Rakesh Kumar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign addresses how approximate hardware might be used to reduce the difficulty and improve results of bitcoin mining. CCN spoke to Dr. Kumar to learn more about this ground-breaking research.\n\nIn mathematics and the sciences, approximation means that something is similar but not precisely equal or identical to something else. The concept of approximation is frequently used to simplify process when a fault-free model is challenging to use. Although approximate hardware design isn’t a new concept, its application to bitcoin mining could have real possibilities.\n\nDr. Rakesh Kumar and his students, Matthew Vilim and Henry Duwe, are presenting a peer-reviewed study, “Approximate Bitcoin Mining,” at the Design and Automation Conference (electronic design) in June 2016. According to the study’s conclusions, bitcoin miners could improve their returns by 30 percent with approximate hardware.\n\nExploiting the Bitcoin Mining Protocol with Approximate Hardware\n\nBitcoin mining hardware is used to generate proof-of-work from nonce to hash. In recent years, bitcoin miners moved from CPUs and GPUs to FPGA or ASIC mining. Bitcoin mining consumes lots of power.\n\nDr. Kumar told CCN, “We began with the questions, ‘Are there ways we can use a deep understanding of bitcoin mining protocol to significantly increase profits?’ and ‘How do we build mining hardware that runs fast, reduces power and increases profits? What non off-the-shelf tricks can we use?’”\n\nWe wanted to identify exploitable characteristics of bitcoin mining protocol to make more money.\n\nApproximate Computing, Error-Tolerance and Approximate Hardware Design\n\nReducing the difficulty of bitcoin mining is obviously important to miners. Dr. Kumar observes, “A lot of applications in the world don’t have to run absolutely correctly on your hardware. In many predictive environments, at the end of the day you’re making a guess…What if your guess is incorrect?”\n\nMany computer applications, such as visual computing applications, are robust to imperfections. They run on hardware with errors, it doesn’t affect user experience. The team learned that bitcoin mining is inherently error-tolerant and that the process is forgiving of errors:\n\nWhat we’ve found is that a processor that needs to guarantee correct operation 100 percent of the time sometimes consumes almost two times more power than a processor you’re asking to be correct only 99 percent of the time…There is this nonlinear behavior. It’s like the last bite problem or the last mile of a marathon…\n\nApproximate Hardware Design: Bitcoin Mining is an Embarrassingly Parallel Application\n\nAccording to Dr. Kumar, bitcoin mining involves the following key steps:\n\nThe bitcoin miner tries to generate a hash that’s less than a certain value. You start at the nonce and look for a value lower than the target. If so, it’s a success.\n\nIf the hash is higher than the target value, you increase the hash by one and generate a new hash.\n\nThe bitcoin miner wants to generate hashes that correspond to a large number of nonces. That’s why bitcoin mining can be considered “an embarrassingly parallel application” in which you generate hashes corresponding to nonces in completely parallel fashion.\n\nMining hardware consists of a set of mining units. Each unit generates a hash corresponding to a nonce and the mining units process different nonces in parallel.\n\nIn bitcoin mining, if one of the mining units has an error for whatever reason, the error affects only the individual mining unit. Bitcoin’s parallelism avoids the propagation of errors. If a single mining unit has errors, it won’t affect others.\n\nFalse Positives and False Negatives in Approximate Hardware\n\nThere are two primary kinds of bitcoin mining faults within a bitcoin mining unit: false positive (mining hardware says that the nonce was a valid nonce even though it was not) and false negative (hardware says the nonce is invalid even though it is valid). Dr. Kumar says:\n\n“The probability of any hardware generating a valid solution is really, really miniscule,” so the probability of a false positive is similarly small. Only one block is generated every 10 minutes. Since the probability is tiny, false positives in approximate hardware just don’t matter. “This will happen really, really, really infrequently.”\n\nIf the hardware misidentifies a solution as valid, the network will quickly identify that the solution is invalid when the miner broadcasts it. “These are essentially immediately rejected.”\n\nIn false negative cases, the nonce corresponded to a valid solution but, because of the fault in the mining hardware, it was recognized as invalid. “The goal of the hardware is to generate a valid proof of work…any reduced hash rate leads to a lower hash rate. This translates to missed opportunity.”\n\nApproximate Hardware Insight\n\nCreating approximate hardware for bitcoin mining isn’t about achieving a perfect mining system. If you make approximate hardware and the speed and size of the system is the same as your system today, then using approximate mining hardware will lead to reduced profits due to faults.\n\nDr. Kumar says that faster, smaller approximate hardware compensates for faults. “When compared to original non-approximate hardware, a smaller and faster approximate system allows the miner to pack more mining units into the same or smaller chip area. Increased speed, and more hashes per second, increases how many bitcoins can be mined per unit-time:”\n\nApproximate hardware accepts false positives and negatives and must be outweighed by the advantages of speed, size, and costs to operate.\n\nSmaller, faster approximate systems can reduce hash computation time by half. The bitcoin miner can generate twice as many hashes per second.\n\nFunctional and Operational Approximation\n\nDr. Kumar and his team believe that approximate hardware design will help bitcoin miners achieve better performance. “Functional approximation allows us to build bitcoin mining hardware differently so that you can do vastly more hashes per second and pack more mining units in the chip area. Operational approximation is all about reducing operating costs and energy efficiency through frequency or voltage overscaling,” he said.\n\nBitcoin mining is an inherently error-tolerant process because of embarrassing parallelism and transactions that are verified in the network.\n\n“Approximate Bitcoin Mining” proposes mining hardware that’s a lot faster, smaller, cost-effective and efficient. Dr. Kumar say his team’s goal isn’t building bitcoin mining hardware. They hope forward-thinking bitcoin mining hardware companies adopt and benefit from the research.\n\nA draft of the peer-reviewed paper can be downloaded here [PDF].\n\nThe article has been edited for clarity, corrective changes and the addition of images.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

The new release was announced by the 21 Inc. team earlier today on the company’s blog.\n\nWithout creating records of each and every transaction on the blockchain. Yes, and it is nothing out of the blue either. The high-frequency bitcoin micropayment processing system created by 21 Inc. to an extent uses some of the not so well-known features already available on the Bitcoin network. The high-frequency micropayment feature on Bitcoin Computer uses nSequence and LockTime features integrated into the Bitcoin network since its inception by Satoshi Nakamoto. The main advantage of these features is to set up future payments. By utilizing this feature, applications of 21 Inc.’s bitcoin computers can accumulate bitcoin over a period of time and then send it as a burst at one certain future set time. It can also be used to send a continuous stream of bitcoin over a period of time, without having the transaction information written onto the blockchain for each individual microtransactions carried out over a period of time.\n\n21 Inc.’s high-frequency microtransactions channel, a gamechanger?\n\nIn the blog, founders of 21 Inc. offer a detailed explanation about the implementation of this new feature into their flagship devices. Bitcoin Computers manufactured by 21 Inc. is built on Raspberry Pi 2 and it can be connected to regular computers running any off-the-shelf operating system. However, one advantage of Bitcoin Computer, over other computers is its efficiency in bitcoin mining. In spite of its less powerful specifications, the Bitcoin Computer comes inbuilt with a 21 mine feature which can be used to start mining bitcoin. The 21 Inc.’s mining pool works differently from other regular mining pools in terms of payouts. Bitcoin Computer users get their fair share of rewards constantly streamed to their inbuilt wallet. These wallets can be used readily to pay/receive bitcoin for applications, goods and services between other Bitcoin Computers.\n\nWhen users start mining for the first time on Bitcoin Computer, they receive an initial advance payment of rewards, which is later on adjusted with bitcoin mined in the future. In order to make use of the micropayments channel, they have to make an initial deposit, which can be readily done with the advance bitcoin rewards they receive. This micropayment channel will be used to pay for applications, goods and services as mentioned earlier.\n\nThere have been issues regarding bitcoin transaction malleability, where the nodes can corrupt the transaction data, creating an invalid transaction hash. In such cases, even though the recipient receives the original transaction, he may be unable to spend it in the future as the previous transaction hash associated with that particular bitcoin might be invalid. The current Jeremy Spilman style payment channels are prone to transaction malleability. 21 Inc.’s micropayment channel uses CLTV (CheckLockTimeVerify) opcode which creates provably spendable outputs, thereby eliminating bitcoin transaction malleability. Read more about CLTV Opcode here.\n\nBitcoin micropayment channel offers a real-time payment option for clients and merchants in such a way that the customer can pay for services as and when he/she receives it. Otherwise, the client would either be required to pay in advance or after receiving the deliverable from the merchant. Such an arrangement, especially with bitcoin transactions creates trust issues as there is always a possibility of the merchant not delivering after receiving payment or the client not paying for the deliverables received. Now, with micropayment channels, the problem is solved. Similarly, it can be used for pay-per-access models on websites and other content delivery platforms.\n\nUnlike Bitcore Payment Channel, which requires the developer/user to make changes to configuration manually, 21 Inc.’s micropayments channel comes included with libraries that can be readily used in the command to configure the payment channel according to requirements.\n\nBitcoin micropayments channel may be a temporary solution for the existing bitcoin scalability issue. The micropayment channel creates just two entries on the blockchain – one when the channel is initiated and another after its termination. It doesn’t matter even if ‘n’ number of transactions takes place through the channel, blockchain will have just two entries.', 'Una compañía de taxis de Budapest, la capital de Hungría, anunció que ha comenzado a recibir bitcoin, una moneda virtual fuera del control de los bancos centrales, como forma de pago.\n\nSeguir a @tecnoycienciaEC\n\nDe esta manera, los viajeros que cuenten con bitcoin podrán pagar en los vehículos a través de su smartphone, explicó Csaba Horváth, director de Budapest Taxi, una de las compañías más grandes de la ciudad.\n\nPara pagar, el pasajero solo tiene que tener, además de la moneda virtual, una aplicación en su teléfono inteligente capaz de leer un código QR que permite abonar el costo del servicio en bitcoin.\n\nPor su parte, el Banco Nacional de Hungría avisó en un comunicado sobre el riesgo de usar bitcoin, argumentando que como la moneda virtual no está supervisada por autoridades tampoco existe una regulación sobre garantías y responsabilidades.\n\nEn Hungría el primer cajero automático para comprar bitcoin se instaló en Budapest en agosto del 2014 en un club nocturno del centro de la ciudad, mientras que el segundo se encuentra en un centro comercial.\n\nSegún estima CoinPay, que desarrolló el sistema de pago, los húngaros actualmente poseen bitcoin por un valor de unos 25 millones de euros (cerca de 29 millones de dólares). La cotización actual de la moneda virtual es de 339 euros por unidad (unos 380 dólares).\n\nEl bitcoin es una forma de pago virtual cuyo valor no descansa en una moneda física emitida por un autoridad, y para su uso no se requiere número de cuenta bancaria ni tarjeta de crédito.\n\nSus críticos sostienen que por la falta de control, el uso del bitcoin es poco seguro y abre la posibilidad de blanquear dinero relacionado con el terrorismo o el narcotráfico.\n\nAnte ello, los usuarios del bitcoin destacan su carácter descentralizado, no dependiente de las autoridades y democrático.\n\nLa moneda está desarrollada colectivamente a través de una plataforma de código abierto y sin el control de ningún organismo regulador o de intermediarios.\n\nOtra de las críticas frente a la moneda virtual es que su cotización cambia rápidamente, pero el sistema introducido ahora elimina este riesgo, haciendo una conversión instantánea, así la compañía recibe el monto en la moneda nacional, el forinto, explicó el responsable de la compañía de taxis.\n\nFuente: EFE', 'ascribe GmbH has announced the release of scalable blockchain database BigchainDB, along with the name of their first customer, Everledger. The company, a service for artists to track intellectual property, made the announcement in conjunction with CEO Bruce Pon’s presentation at the Block Chain Conference in San Francisco earlier this week.\n\n“The breakthrough was achieved by imbuing the best characteristics of blockchains, immutability and decentralization onto an existing big data distributed database,” said Trent McConaghy, CTO and project lead, in a press release sent to CoinReport.\n\n“In conversations with the community, the emphasis seemed to be on scaling up blockchains. We came to realize that a distributed database perspective brought a lot to the table, not only for scalability but also for other key database functionality like a flexible query language, efficient querying, and a permissioning system. Our approach was to ‘blockchain-ify’ a scalable distributed database.”\n\nBigchainDB can process one million writes per second and allows for the deployment of blockchain applications and platforms at scale. The database is designed for scenarios that require high-throughput, higher storage capacity and lower latency. Applicable use cases include streamlining clearing and settlements in the finance industry and tracking supply chains. The throughput capacity of this database exceeds the peak volume of NASDAQ by 10 times.\n\nBigchainDB’s first customer, Everledger, is a ledger for diamond transaction verification and identification. The company has already proven its position in the diamond industry, with its platform having embedded one million diamonds in 2015.\n\n“It’s a natural fit to work with ascribe, especially given we often shared our challenges and concerns as we were tackling similar problems at scale in parallel universes – digital and physical assets,” said Leanne Kemp, CEO and founder of Everledger. “It’s a privilege to work with the entire team at ascribe.”\n\nascribe is in talks with other enterprises regarding the deployment of BigchainDB. The company is also working with blockchain and cloud platform providers to integrate the database into their solutions.\n\nascribe released a whitepaper in conjunction with the announcement.

I always encourage them to consider applying to an accelerator program since one-third of all Series A rounds in 2015 were in companies that graduated from accelerators. But what about the companies that don’t get accepted into accelerator programs? The acceptance rate is fairly low (Techstars accepts 1% of all applicants), so startups should have a backup plan when it comes to securing Series A.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, early-stage VCs may only look to top-tier accelerators for their pipeline of Series A-worthy prospects. With the amount of hands-on time that these alums receive from mentors, founders, and other great entrepreneurial minds, it makes sense to look more closely at these startups when investing.\n\nSo your company missed the cut when applying to an accelerator program – how can your company attract more VC eyes?\n\nLeverage Your Network\n\nWhen fundraising, your network is critical, whether you went through an accelerator or not. Surrounding yourself with the people who have done it right, who know the game well, and can give you the right tips is key to your company’s success in fundraising.\n\nRecognize that there are an enormous number of companies being created each year and ultimately many of them are competing for the same Series A money. Techstars sees tens of thousands of startups applying to our programs each year, and we only fund about 250 at the seed level annually. Of those 250, about half go on to raise Series A rounds.\n\nOne reason those 125 or so companies are able to raise Series A rounds is due to tapping their networks early in their companies’ lifecycle. I see a lot of early-stage companies meeting with later-stage investors well in advance of being in the market for a Series A round. They build relationships early, maintain those relationships, and knock when the time is right.\n\nThe market is flooded with seed capital, but there is no more Series A capital than there has been over recent years. So start early, and build genuine relationships before you start your Series A tour. Those in top-tier accelerators may have an unfair advantage in that regard, but you can manufacture a strong network and book those early meetings as well.\n\nExtend Your Network\n\nThe broader and more global your network, the easier time you’ll have leveraging your progress and credibility in order to manufacture meetings. This broad network comes easier to companies that can go through an accelerator, as you connect with other in-program companies, investors, and mentors, but how can you build a larger network organically?\n\nYou may have a small network, but growing that network has become easier with the use of social tools. LinkedIn, Conspire, even Facebook and Twitter allow you to grab branches that may have previously seemed out of reach.\n\nThose LinkedIn connections, friends-of-friends, previous coworkers you haven’t spoken to in years, are all at your disposal. They may not be the VC you’d like to invest in your company, but they may be able to make an introduction or give you tips on how to get your foot in the door. You’ll never know until you ask.\n\nBe Series A Ready\n\nI’m often asked what it takes to be “Series A ready” in terms of metrics, progress, and traction. Unfortunately, there’s no easy answer. Series A investments are competitive right now, and the smartest VCs I know are still willing to take a chance before there’s any concrete proof.\n\nWhat is necessary is conviction on the part of the investor. So think of traction as often necessary but generally insufficient evidence to help generate conviction.\n\nLearn From the Process\n\nHaving recently raised $150 million for institutional investors, I heard many people say no, and you will too. The key is to take as many meetings as possible. Build those relationships early. Maintain those relationships. Leverage angel and micro-VC connections before even thinking of pitching them.\n\nWhen fundraising, your network is critical. Leveraging it early and often is the key. Don’t make the mistake of waiting until you need money to engage sources of capital. If you’re in a squeeze for capital and you have a solid, mutually beneficial relationship with a VC, your chances of raising will increase dramatically.\n\n– David Cohen is the co-founder and managing partner of Techstars', 'Australian blockchain payments company Living Room of Satoshi has announced a rewards program for its users.

Das Paper erklärt die Grundlagen von Bitcoin und diskutiert mögliche Anwendungen für Überweisungen, genossenschaftliche Strukturen und Mikroversicherungen, speziell in Dritte Welt Ländern.\n\nEr gibt jedoch auch zu bedenken, daß die Bitcoin Community eine Art “Technik-von-oben” Ansatz, der einem Technik als Lösung aller Probleme anpreise, und wirft der Community vor, sie würde mit libertären politischen Idealen evangelisieren.\n\nIm Kontrast dazu werden im Paper Blockchain 2.0-Technologien mit “eher kommunitaristischen Idealen” und ihr Potential für eine “Zusammenarbeit auf hoher Ebene” angepriesen.\n\nBitcoin – losgelöst von der “düsteren sozialen Realität” in Dritte Welt Ländern\n\nDa Kryptowährungen auf kollaborativen open-source Grundsätzen und peer-to-peer-Netzwerken basieren, sollte laut Scott innerhalb der Bitcoin Community ein generelles soziales Engagement und der Wunsch zur gegenseitigen Hilfe omnipräsent sein.\n\nJedoch zitiert er Yelowitz und Wilsons Paper von 2015 “Characteristics of Bitcoin Users” und kritisiert, daß Bitcoins Bild in der Öffentlichkeit nun stark mit “Spekulierern, Profitorientierten Unternehmern, Libertären und Leuten mit Tech-Fetisch” assoziiert wird.\n\nAuch wenn Bitcoin als eine Lösung für die Menschen ohne Zugang zu einer Bank in Dritte Welt Ländern angepriesen wird, gibt es laut Scott Zweifel, ob digitale Währungen in Ländern mit begrenztem Zugang zum Internet funktionieren können.\n\nNeben dem Problem, überhaupt ein Vertrauen in eine kaum verstandene Technologie aufzubauen benötigt die Nutzung von Bitcoin sowohl Internet als auch Elektrizität. Daraus schließt Scott, daß die Bitcoin-Community, da sie diese Probleme nicht verstehe “kaum einen Zugang zur düsteren Realität in vielen ärmeren Ländern” habe und fügt an:\n\n“Die oft agressive Rhetorik innerhalb der Community und die Ungleichheit innerhalb des Systems scheinen, zumindest auf den ersten Blick, sich mit den Idealen von sozialen und genossenschaftlichen ökonomischen Bewegungen zu beißen.”\n\nInternet ist ggf keine Lösung\n\nScott nutzt außerdem die Möglichkeit für eine eher politische Kritik an Bitcoin und sagt daß jene, die Bitcoin als eine “Rettungsbootwährung” anpreisen, die eine “Flucht ins Internet” der Suche nach “grundlegenderen Lösung zur Behebung der Probleme eines Landes” vorziehen.\n\nDas Eintreten für eine Bitcoin-Akzeptanz in wirtschaftsschwachen Nationen sei bestenfalls eine kurzfristige Lösung; laut Scott “lenke dies Länder von einer wirklichen Stärkung von fragilen Institutionen ab”\n\nWeiterhin schreibt er:\n\n“Bitcoin als ein Gegengewicht gegen mächtige Bankenkartelle in mächtigen Staaten wie den USA aufzubauen mag Leuten gefallen, aber ein Land wie Zimbabwe benötigt vor allen ein starkes, integres, Banksystem. Sowas kann nur durch langfristige politische Kämpfe kommen.”\n\nDie Entstehung eines “techno-liberalen Evangelismus” und das Aufkommen von “Blockchain-Missionaren in Entwicklungsländern, die Technologie und Märkte als Messias, gepaar mit einer Anti-Staat-Botschaft predigen” wird im weiteren Verlauf des Schreibens kritisiert.\n\nWie Technologie nicht in einem Vakuum funktioniert werden laut Scott Bitcoin-Systeme nicht einfach “auf verarmte Dritte Welt Länder zum Segen für alle herabkommen”.\n\nZum Ende Hin sieht Scott zwar ein paar mögliche sinnvolle Use Cases für Bitcoin und Blockchain-Technologie im Allgemeinen, spricht jedoch auch eine Warnung aus:\n\n“Auch wen die Community um diese Technologie enthusiastisch und innovativ ist, ist sie in ihrer Gesamtheit sehr anziehend für eine elitäre, technokratische und disruptive Startup-Kultur.”\n\nEr schlägt weitere Untersuchungen vor um herauszufinden, wie die Technologie derart implementiert wird, daß sie die “wahren Schwierigkeiten, die Menschen in unterschiedlichen kulturellen und politischen Kontexten” beachtet.\n\nBTC-Echo\n\nQuelle: UN Paper: Pushing Bitcoin for Third World Issues is ‘Techno Colonialism’ via CoinDesk\n\nÜber Dr. Philipp Giese Dr. Philipp Giese arbeitet nebenberuflich als Analyst für BTC-ECHO und ist auf die Bereiche Chartanalyse und Technologie spezialisiert.

02/14/2016,"['Photo via Twitter\n\nPharmaceutical CEO and American bad guy Martin Shkreli has taken great pleasure in being a full-time societal troll. He\'s raised the price of critical HIV treatment drug by 5000%, then made a mockery of his Congressional hearing on the controversial decision. He also purchased the single copy of Wu Tang Clan\'s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin then threatened to have Ghost Face Killah scrubbed from its tracks. For some who has so delighted in screwing others, it would be only a matter of before someone screwed him. That time has come.\n\nIn a bid to own exclusive rights to Kanye West\'s forthcoming album The Life of Pablo, Shkreli evidently struck a deal and sent 15 million in Bitcoin to someone he believed to be a representative from West\'s legal team. Shkreli, who seems to relish in bragging about his business transactions on Twitter, tweeted the sale, attempting to turn around a 10 million dollar profit before the transaction had even been confirmed.\n\nThings took an unexpected turn when Shkreli supposedly didn\'t receive what he paid for:\n\nBut then came hints that this was Martin all just taking the piss out of everyone. He tried to rally together an impromptu investigative team via a public video chat, then claimed both to be starting a GoFundMe and that Bitcoin\'s mysterious founder Satoshi Nakamoto (who\'s identity remains unconfirmed) was helping him get his money back.\n\nAccording to Finance Magnates who devote a section of their magazine to cryptocurrency, the easiest way to know if Shkreli indeed lost 15 million in Bitcoin on a deal would be to simply look at the ledger. Like all digital currencies, every transaction of Bitcoin leaves a trackable mark by being recorded onto a ""block chain"" ledger. It\'s impossible to bypass the ledger when using Bitcoin, though you can make it a pain to track down a transaction by withholding the record (which is like refusing to hand over a receipt when attempting to prove a sale). Though Shkreli has thus far refused to share the transaction information, Bitcoin experts, the magazine suspects, should be able to verify track the transaction history down. 15 million in Bitcoin, after all, is a lot of money.\n\nCorrection [February 14]: A previous version of this article stated that Shkreli had spent 15 million Bitcoins, or over six billion USD, to acquire The Life of Pablo. Shkreli actually spent 15 million USD worth of Bitcoin.\n\n', 'Bitcoin price advance accelerated today and pushed to $400 (Bitstamp) and 2740 CNY.

The top may not be in, although a wave count (annotated i,ii,iii,iv,v) has five waves complete. The bitcoin chart sometimes advances in seven waves.\n\n3) MACD (top) is turning down from its upper Bollinger Band, and both the stochastics and RSI have diverged from the latest price high. These are bearish indications.\n\nIf price fails to push to a new high and, instead declines below its 20-period moving average (green), then additional advance is on the cards. There are many bearish indications in the chart, and a deeper correction (or reversal) is now likely, but as long as price remains above the 1hr 20MA, the advance can continue.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price has sprung a surprise mini-rally that increases in pace with each new price wave. Although there are many signals that a reversal is due, it is frustrating that price is not making a tell-tale correction. When it does, the depth of the correction and its wave structure will show whether there will be additional decline or whether this odd advance has further to go.\n\nBitfinex Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

The digital currency has been struggling between the $370s and $380s for weeks before it could break out of the resistance and surge ahead. The increase in price can be contributed to different factors, starting with people trading their altcoins for bitcoin as altcoin prices are exhibiting a downward trend.\n\nLast week ethereum saw an unprecedented increase in value after the price peaked to an all-time high of 0.0171 BTC per ethereum. Over 60000 BTCs were traded in for ethereum during those days. Once the fresh demand for the cryptocurrency subsided, there was a fall in its price.\n\nThe recent Bitcoin Roundtable discussion maybe another reason for the increased confidence in Bitcoin in the past couple of days. There were uncertainties regarding the impending hard-fork of the Bitcoin network as part of Bitcoin Classic adoption. All the bitcoin miners, mining pools, wallet providers, exchanges and other bitcoin-related businesses as part of the Bitcoin Roundtable have now unilaterally rejected the implementation of Bitcoin Classic or any other Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that calls for hard-forking of the Blockchain. Any fear regarding the disruption of Bitcoin services have subsided following this decision and trading is returning to normalcy.\n\nOne can’t discount holidays and other important days either. Holiday season is known to drive bitcoin price upwards, due to increased spending on gifts, travel etc. The same holds good for Valentine’s Day as well. According to data available from various sources, people are expected to spend close to $20 billion during Valentine’s day. A portion of such huge spending also includes bitcoin payments. Also, Bitcoin companies are not far behind.\n\nAnalysis of the price trend shows that the value of bitcoin has been progressively exhibiting an upward trend with small fluctuations within a band. The price rise to $400 is followed by a slight dip of a couple of dollars. If the graph is extrapolated, considering the trading conditions will remain more or less the same, we can say that the price is poised to increase further this week. We may be seeing another $10-$20 increase in value over a period of one week. At the time of posting, the bitcoin price was at around $398.99 (BitStamp).\n\nWe may expect a better performance from bitcoin in the coming days. With increased adoption of blockchain technology and increased interest in bitcoin among governments who can possibly work in favor of the digital currency. If the members of Commonwealth of Nations accept the proposals made by the organization’s recent report on virtual currencies, we can see about 50 countries making bitcoin legal in their territories. Backed by the government regulations, bitcoin will enter the mainstream economy in all these nations resulting in increased adoption.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

It has been labeled a Ponzi scheme and a failed experiment. Writers have argued for it to be forgotten and for developers to move on to greener pastures. But moving beyond this rhetoric, it’s not all that difficult to compare the rise of bitcoin to that of another technology: the World Wide Web.\n\nAs with the web, the early days were filled with excitement, over-enthusiasm, and bubble-like behaviors, commonly referred to as the hype-cycle. On October 13, 1994, the Mosaic Netscape 0.9 browser was launched. Six years later, the world experienced the 2000 dot-com collapse, resulting in many companies completely evaporating.\n\nThe excitement of the web resulted in venture capitalists throwing money at any company whose name ended with a “.com”. The idea that a company would achieve profitability was irrelevant — all investors cared about was growth. Venture capitalists got greedy.\n\nBut that greed was not inherently bad. Fred Wilson, venture partner at Union Square Ventures, commented on the tech bubble in Boom & Bust: A Look at Economic Bubbles:\n\n“A friend of mine has a great line. He says ‘Nothing important has ever been built without irrational exuberance’. Meaning that you need some of this mania to cause investors to open up their pocketbooks and finance the building of the railroads or the automobile or aerospace industry or whatever. And in this case, much of the capital invested was lost, but also much of it was invested in a very high throughput backbone for the Internet, and lots of software that works, and databases, and server structure. All that stuff has allowed what we have today, which has changed our lives … that’s what all this speculative mania built.”\n\nDue to that same speculative mania, the valuation of companies skyrocketed. Then the bubble burst. Amazon.com went from $107 per share down to $7 per share. Many other companies went bankrupt. The same investors who had been touting the perpetual rise in tech stock valuations were the same ones that lost billions — if not trillions — of dollars. It was greed and ignorance that resulted in the bubble.\n\nBut what came out on the other side was a framework for incredible companies to be launched.\n\nTake, for example, Facebook, which launched on February 4, 2004. Without the infrastructure that had been built during the boom and bust, would Facebook have been able to launch? What about Uber? How about the collection of all the world’s information from Google?\n\nWith hindsight, no one doubts that the web was going to become a reality one way or the other. But at the time, when investors were shutting down funds because they had bet on one too many Pets.com or iWon.com, many doubted its survivability.\n\nAnd yet here we are on the web.\n\nIt’s still early for bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is seven years old and it is experiencing many problems that early technologies have experienced. In many respects, even at seven, it is still not even October 13, 1994 for the technology.\n\nDespite this, investors have thrown incredible amounts of money — perhaps too much — at the space. If you were a wallet provider, a remittance company, or a payment processor, investors would give you money. In 2014 and early 2015, starting a bitcoin company was one of the easiest ways to get funding.\n\nThere was irrational exuberance. Truthfully, bitcoin didn’t warrant that kind of money from a rational perspective. And yet, investors were throwing it at them primarily because of greed.\n\nAnd as with all technologies, there are growing pains. Early bitcoin was filled with inefficient companies and poor custodians. Mt. Gox resulted in individuals losing hundreds of millions of dollars collectively. Silk Road made people believe that bitcoin was only for drugs.\n\nYet bitcoin is growing and that perception is changing. Old exchanges are dead or dying. The next stage of exchanges, such as Coinbase, takes both security and regulation seriously. Millions of dollars are spent on security analysts and individuals to work with regulators. In many cases, companies that are incapable of building out their own secure platforms rely on BitGo, the leading provider of security software in the bitcoin space. The companies built on top of its technology have sent over $1 billion in transactions and not a single penny has been stolen.\n\nFurther, the number of users on the network and the number of transactions they send are growing. Companies like Purse, ChangeTip, and ZapChain are offering actual use cases for the technology. Purse enables people to buy goods on Amazon; ChangeTip allows for micro-transactions; and ZapChain is creating an incentive for create high quality discussion.\n\nBitcoin’s existential crisis\n\nAs has been covered by the New York Times and Mike Hearn, bitcoin is going through an existential crisis. But while their message is one of failure, it’s simply another growing pain for the network.\n\nDespite the insistence from many in the bitcoin community to increase the block size, the Core development team has developed its own roadmap on how to scale bitcoin, including an implementation of Segregated Witness via a soft fork. And there’s no denying that scaling is necessary. Presently, bitcoin can only handle about 3 transactions per second (TPS). For bitcoin to become the payment protocol for the Internet, it will need to be able to support more.\n\nDissatisfied with the proposal put forth by the Core development team, a handful of developers have launched an alternative client for the bitcoin protocol, Bitcoin Classic. The proposal is to hard fork to a 2MB block size, which is double what the block size presently is. Further, the majority of the miners, including Bitmain, Bitfury, and BW.com have agreed to support this hard fork. The largest wallets and exchanges, including Coinbase, Xapo, and Blockchain.info are on board.\n\nWhat’s clear is that bitcoin is experiencing an existential crisis. What is bitcoin? Should it be a competitor to Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal or should it be a settlement layer with all the major transactions done on a second layer? Can bitcoin remain decentralized and censorship-free if it scales?\n\nWhile there is certainly a crisis taking place, it’s not one that will result in the death of bitcoin. To say otherwise is to be led by emotion and negativity rather than reality.\n\nThe future of bitcoin\n\nWhat is increasingly likely is that the future of bitcoin is bright. It is the seventh year in the development of this network. It takes years to build out a protocol, which is what bitcoin is. As Joel Spolsky says, “Good software takes 10 years. Get used to it.”\n\n“Bitcoin is comparable to the pre-web-browser 1992-era Internet. This is still the very early days of bitcoin’s life. The base layer protocol is now stable (TCP/IP). Now engineers are building the second layer (HTTP) that makes bitcoin usable for average people and machines,” Jeff Garzik, founder of Bloq and Core developer of bitcoin, told me.\n\nOnce the infrastructure is built, which still has many more years ahead of it, with companies like Bloq, BitGo, 21.co, and Coinbase leading the charge, we’ll begin to see solid programs built in the application layer.\n\nBut even while we wait for the infrastructure to be built, it’s clear that bitcoin is evolving.\n\nTake mining, for example. There is no doubt that bitcoin mining is enormously centralized, particularly in China with over 50% of the hash rate. However, that is going to change thanks to the efforts of companies like 21.co.\n\nAccording to the company’s about page, “someone needs to build the full-stack infrastructure for bitcoin, from silicon to software … that someone is us.” In November, the company released its first product, the 21 Bitcoin Computer, which was a dev kit to introduce developers to bitcoin.\n\nYet, this is the first step. As 21.co improves the design of its chips, it’s possible that it could roll out a router that perpetually mines for you. Or, it could integrate a tiny miner into your cell phone. But this mining is not so that individuals can get rich on the block reward. Rather, the goal is for bitcoin to become the fuel for participating on the Internet.\n\nRight now, if you wanted to do a search on Google, you’d have to trade being inundated with ads and tracking cookies that follow you around the web. A developer could build a search engine over the 21 Bitcoin Computer whereby a user would have to pay a minuscule amount of bitcoin to make their search.\n\nOnce you abstract away the idea of procuring bitcoin that sits within a single user’s wallet, our idea of what the Internet is and how it works begins to change. Instead of companies taking individual’s data, those same companies might have to pay a consumer for their data. Want to know that I am a 27-year-old male in New York? That’ll cost 5,000 satoshis, the smallest divisible unit of a bitcoin. In the future, this can all be automated.\n\nWhat about the killer application that everyone talks about? Taking away the fact that hundreds — if not thousands — of products will be built over the coming years, there are some that have the potential to be the killer app now. Fred Wilson, who I mentioned above, believes that in 2016, “Bitcoin finally finds a killer app with the emergence of Open Bazaar protocol powered zero take rate marketplaces.”\n\nAnd none of this even touches on the potential for bitcoin to help the underserved markets of the world. While remittance has yet to be solved, companies are attempting to make progress. Fortunately, the markets that are underserved and under-banked happen to have tremendous mobile-phone exposure. That will make remittance easier as more people learn about bitcoin.\n\nFinally, we return to what many considered bitcoin’s first, fundamental use case: digital gold. While bitcoin remains volatile today, it’s certainly not the only volatile asset in the world. And before we lament a 10% drop in the price of a still new asset, consider that the stock market has experienced 10% drops in similar time frames. What about oil? Or gold? Or coal? Even mature assets can experience price fluctuations.\n\nConsider the fact that trading volume is up in many of the same countries that are likely to benefit the most from digital gold. Argentina is experiencing some of its highest points of volume. Brazil, which is dealing with debt problems, is also at its highest point. India has had tremendous growth in the number of people using bitcoin. Even Russia, which is considering making bitcoin illegal, has seen outsized growth in volume.\n\nBitcoin’s reality\n\nBitcoin is not perfect. It has a lot of problems that it is going to have to overcome. But to label it dead or to call for it to be replaced by something new is naive and shortsighted. This battle in the civil war will end, likely with Bitcoin Classic rolling out a hard fork with significant consensus. New applications will be built that provide more use cases for different audiences. And ultimately, the Internet will get its first, true payment protocol.\n\nBut Bitcoin is seven years old. It will take many years for the infrastructure to be laid and for these applications to reach critical mass. Facebook had nearly 20 years after the browser was released to reach a billion users. To imagine bitcoin’s true potential, we need to think in decades, not in months or years. Fortunately, we’re well on our way.\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full time product manager and a freelance journalist covering the bitcoin and Blockchain space. He runs a weekly newsletter that curates the most important bitcoin news called Crypto Brief.\n\n', ""Ethereum's value has appreciated by over 500 percent since the beginning of this year. Here are some of the possible reasons...\n\nEthereum, the crypto-token of the Ethereum platform has become increasingly popular amongst cryptocurrency enthusiasts over the past few weeks.\n\nEthereum’s value has appreciated by nearly 500 percent since the beginning of 2015. In January, one ethereum was roughly worth 0.00212BTC. Almost a month and a half down the line, the value stands at around 0.01101 BTC.\n\nWhat Are the Reasons behind the Phenomenal Rise in the Price of Ethereum?\n\nFuture Investment\n\nEthereum is notably one of the valuable platforms. With the global FinTech industry shifting towards blockchain technology-based applications to suit their requirements, smart contracts, and automation of financial processes takes precedence.\n\nEthereum is tailor-made for such applications.\n\nAs the demand for the Ethereum platform and its smart contracts enabled network increases, the value of Ethereum as a cryptocurrency will continue to surge.\n\nDemand Driven Appreciation\n\nWhile there are few investing in ethereum for its future potential, there are those who just follow the trend. The increasing demand and value of a certain cryptocurrency serve as an indicator of its potential (even though it may turn out to be wrong at times). Whatever the reason is, it still increases the demand – meaning a further increase in ethereum price.\n\nFaltering Faith in Bitcoin\n\nIt is speculated that the continuing block-size debate is one of the reasons for the increase in the demand of Ethereum. While it is hard to substantiate, the recent number seems to indicate that there might be an ounce of truth in it. In a span of 24 hours, 60,000 BTCs were traded for ethereum last week. There are reports (unverifiable at the moment) indicating a well-orchestrated ploy by unknown individuals or entities sending messages to bitcoin subscribers on social media about Ethereum being an alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nPositive News Reports\n\nEthereum as a platform has been receiving a lot of positive press lately. Many companies and organizations have expressed their support to the platform.\n\nEthereum has completed yet another phase. The platform is expected to announce the stable release – Homestead which will follow Frontier soon. Homestead is a very important milestone for the platform as it signifies its maturity from a beta test phase to a more stable development phase. Even though Ethereum will still be far from complete with Homestead release, it is a great progress nevertheless.\n\nIt is also reported that ethereum will soon be added as one of the tradable assets on many crypto-trading platforms. It will increase the access to Ethereum market, resulting in more ETH/BTC and ETH/Altcoin trading.\n\nAugur, the much awaited Ethereum based prediction platform is about to be launched soon. And so are many other companies/startups offering smart contract solutions, all based on the same cryptocurrency.\n\nIs the growth sustainable?\n\nEthereum price reached an all-time high of 0.0171 BTC on 12th of this month, only to experience a considerable fall soon after. Even though the cryptocurrency value is not showing any upward trend at the moment, it has scaled new heights, and it will continue to perform better than it used to in the previous months.\n\nThe cryptocurrency may not sustain this growth in a short term, but the demand is bound to grow in the long term. The ones with long term trading plans are bound to gain a lot as time progresses.\n\nThe statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC.

At large, international scale conferences, executives and those heavily involved in the financial and banking sector have painted with broad strokes on their opinions about blockchain.\n\nMany executives see the technology as ultimately useful if it can be leveraged properly. However, the radical nature of blockchain technology and its inherent association with an uncomfortably disruptive technology in Bitcoin has caused some entrenched finance pro’s to turn up their noses. This whitepaper by D+H gives an honest assessment of what blockchain technology will need to bring to the table in order to be palatable and widely applicable in a notoriously guarded, regulated, conservative and risk-averse industry.\n\nA New Era of Financial Services\n\nThe introduction makes it clear that many financial services professionals, including the writers of this paper, will concede that finance as we understand it traditionally is at a crossroads. Markets are changing, but more importantly, technology is changing even faster. There seemed to initially be a collective hesitance to not be the first-mover with a large rush of investment into blockchain technology from banks, but now that atmosphere has changed.\n\n“If 2014-2015 was the era of blockchain experimentation and innovation, then 2016-2017 is the time when this rapidly evolving technology should start to emerge from banks’ back forms and begin to be applied to solve real business problems.”\n\nBut Is There A Problem With The Market?\n\nThe papers point to the Payment Services Directive in the EU, the Dodd-Frank Act in the USA and the Basel III Capital and Liquidity Framework as major changes to the financial services within the last 3-5 years. They’ve increased competition and pressure in the industry by introducing challenger banks and third party payment processors. The effects of this on banks has made their operations as a whole more complex and prone to friction and high costs.\n\nThere certainly seems to be no real opportunity to place blame on the state of blockchain technology, but rather on the state of the finance industry as being hamstrung by legacy technology, traditions and also external regulation from governments both domestic and abroad. Even though the blockchain technology in theory should work beautifully instead of what banks are using now to move money and more, it’s unclear to banks how they’ll actually be able to change their ways of operation fast enough and effective enough to make a switch viable.\n\nPayments Are Probably Where Blockchain Is Most Promising\n\nThere can be endless talk on the potential and theoretical aspects of blockchain from a digital currency, smart contracts and market standpoint, but D+H believes that payments will be where blockchain technology will be used in the best way.\n\n“Blockchain offers an unrivaled ability to tackle these issues – opening the way to the creation of a global payments environment characterized by less friction, higher speed, great efficiency, and enhanced transparency and security.”\n\nAccording to D+H the five obstacles that blockchain must tackle to be used in Fintech are:\n\nFind the right problem to fix. Blockchain probably can’t be used in every single aspect of operation from a bank’s perspective, so leaders are going to have to think really hard about the best possible use-causes to tackle up-front. There has to be a dominant use or application to convince banks to move highly sensitive data or processes over to blockchain technology. Without a rock-solid few use cases that banks are compelled to use, the cascading effect of a full blockchain integration will be slow to follow. The value and disruptive potential of the blockchain technology must not lose its luster once it’s been saddled with “regulatory and industry” baggage. The technology needs to scale on all levels to handle every aspect of what an international banking system can and will need from it. The blockchain’s success in banking is dependent on the technology being able to fully align with the timescales and perspectives of banks and institutions. That includes long-term (as in decades) plans and the continued reliability of very old and established companies.\n\nWhat’s interesting about this paper is that in the title “5 Things The Blockchain Must Get Right” it seems to be addressed to some central mind share that controls “the blockchain.” As if it’s like a bunch of bankers talking to Bitcoin core developers giving them a list of ransom demands if their technology is to be accepted someday. But in reality, the banks needs to face inward when addressing whether or not they can actually change fast enough and be agile enough to use blockchain technology.\n\n“In our view, the conditions for tackling each of these challenges can be found within the banks themselves… This creates a strong case for banks to use blockchain for internal utilities – in turn enabling them to gain the experience and insight needed to roll out blockchain capabilities across the ecosystem.”\n\nIt’s almost certain that there will be some very brave and hopefully very successful first movers in the banking industry to move on integrating blockchain technology into their Fintech in a significant way. Hopefully, that risk loaded leap of faith in this new technology will reap those first movers many benefits and prove to the others that they shouldn’t have waited on the sidelines for so long.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'As the calendar turns to February, major global financial institutions are becoming increasingly vocal about the blockchain tech trials taking place in their innovation labs.\n\nIn recent weeks, UBS has announced experiments with smart bond applications, NRI has discussed investigating distributed ledgers for securities use cases and even JPMorgan, long one of the more bearish among banks on bitcoin and digital currency concepts, revealed it is seeking to evaluate the technology\'s use for improving trading processes.\n\nMore unique among these major firms, however, has been Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), which hinted in November that it was experimenting with blockchain tech to improve its consumer rewards and loyalty offerings. For Canada’s largest bank, boasting C$10bn in 2015 earnings, the announcement seemed at first glance to be a rare consumer play among a broad industry move toward B2B applications.\n\nHowever, in a new interview, Linda Mantia, RBC\'s EVP of digital, payments and cards, indicated that the bank is looking at different use cases for the technology, with tests focused on applications for capital markets, cross-border payments and smart contracts.\n\nMantia indicated that for RBC, as in the industry at large, there’s a feeling that blockchain tech will become a kind of financial Internet for which the full ramifications of the technology have yet to be unlocked.\n\nMantia told CoinDesk:\n\n""We’re all trying to figure out what it means. If Steve Jobs had tried us to tell us everything the iPad could do, we wouldn’t have understood it.""\n\nMantia also addressed the growing hype surrounding blockchain, justifying the dialogue on the basis that, if there’s a potential for the next Amazon, eBay or PayPal-type service to be created, banks face a risk by not trying to seek out potential applications.\n\n""If you look at every major advancement enabled by technology, there’s always hype. Eighty percent of the money won’t make it, but the last 20% can be massive,"" she continued. ""At the end of every hype there\'s something transformative.""\n\nThe comments come as members of the financial community are increasingly warning about the positive market sentiment being created around the technology.\n\nBut as a market leader, Mantia said, RBC can’t shy away from the opportunities and risks involved, adding:\n\n""No one wants to miss it. If you don’t hop on the hype bandwagon, you’ll be left behind.""\n\nUpgrading loyalty\n\nWhile Mantia did not reveal much about RBC’s rewards proof-of-concept, first discussed in November, she did speak to the value of experimenting with blockchain technology for the bank’s loyalty program.\n\nFirst and foremost, Mantia described blockchain as a technology that would help RBC better deliver on its existing loyalty value proposition for customers.\n\n""We’ve always said, ‘Your points, your money’. So we don’t lock people into the rewards store. We also let in certain merchants like Best Buy, so clients can use our points to buy from them,"" she continued, adding:\n\n""We were moving pretty aggressively to let our clients think of it as another form of cash.""\n\nShe hinted that a decentralized ledger could help it more effectively enforce the rules around this payment option, while also providing RBC with a means to improve operability with its partners.\n\nExpanding mandate\n\nRBC\'s control over its loyalty program, she said, also affords the bank the ability to use the technology in its own ecosystem.\n\nHowever, RBC is also working with 41 of its peers as part of the blockchain consortium led by R3CEV, though it is not alone among members in pursuing private POCs.\n\nAccording to Mantia, RBC first began researching bitcoin internally as part of its payments division. Mantia specializes in digital banking, credit cards, loyalty and retail payments, and is part of the company’s innovation efforts.\n\nShe described the culture that RBC is trying to create as one where questions are embraced and evaluated with an emphasis on business need, even if that means heading into uncharted areas.\n\n""We started looking at it when it was just bitcoin to see what was it that was so interesting,"" Mantia recalls. ""It was clearly trying to solve global commerce.""\n\nTo Mantia’s team, bitcoin had proved most impressive when considered against past payments innovations, thus increasing RBC’s interest. But, she said the bank was early in its understanding that the blockchain represented perhaps the biggest opportunity.\n\n""We thought this idea of getting distributed computer centers around a problem is probably the future, but we didn’t understand enough where it was going and we have been thinking through where we could use it,"" she said.\n\nDigital cash\n\nMantia also spoke to the idea that RBC is seeking to expand its line of payment products, while underscoring the benefits to the anonymity or semi-anonymity a form of ""digital cash"" could provide.\n\nStill, Mantia was non-committal about coming to a conclusion on the open, bitcoin blockchain, to date the only commercial-scale version of the technology.\n\nWhen asked if she sees a future for bitcoin as a digital currency, she said that she believes there’s value to the idea.\n\n“When you shop online do you need digital cash? Do you need it for the unbanked?"" she asked, concluding:\n\n""There’s something to it, there’s something that needs to be solved, a currency for the global economy.”\n\nImage credit:rmnoa357 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Very little innovation has taken place in the post trade clearing/settlement environment and even less when it comes to trading between counterparties. The FIX protocol helped usher in the world of high frequency/algorithmic trading but was to limited to only trade execution.\n\nBlockchain is just one of a number of technological innovations such as machine learning/AI, multi-tenant cloud architectures, and Big Database platforms, that have the potential to liberate markets from incumbent players and start the process of real – not phantom – liquidity generation away from market makers and investment banks and toward the infrastructure of the market itself.\n\nA major ancillary benefit is that a series of expensive, time-consuming activities could be dramatically reduced for hedge funds with the adoption of distributed ledger technology. A blockchain-based ledger would be continuously updated, secure and available to all permissioned participants. This would obviate the need to constantly communicate data back and forth between hedge funds and their trading counter parties and subsequently reduce the need to reconcile that data and store it ad infinitum.\n\nWhether it is transforming traditional clearing/settlement cycles or supporting the price discovery/liquidity process across non-equity asset classes, investment banks (eg: Goldman Sachs), emerging technology players (eg: Digital Asset Holdings), exchanges (eg: Nasdaq Linq) and market data vendors (eg: MarkIT) recognize the opportunity and are positioning themselves accordingly.\n\nJust a link in a wider chain\n\nBlockchain-based technology represents just one aspect of a wider, more fundamental shift in the infrastructure of the global financial markets. As mentioned previously, the post-trade lifecycle has remained a largely innovation-free zone since the creation of Euroclear (arguably the last major post-trade innovation).\n\nNow, a host of commercial imperatives are driving the adoption of new technologies such as blockchain, not least among them the impact of regulation on banks\' – particularly investment banks\' – returns on capital.\n\nInstead of using their balance sheets and trading acumen as a competitive advantage, regulation is driving banks to look at technology as a means to achieve more stable, less volatile shareholder returns by morphing into utility-type players. It is no surprise Goldman wants to consider itself a ""technology business”. The adjacent benefit of being a utility is that you see \'flow\' and that itself may open up other monetizable opportunities.\n\nDisruptive technology is where the future lies; and where everyone in the market appears to be long-term greedy.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

02/15/2016,"[""If karma is a real thing, Martin Shkreli just made a lump sum payment on his sins in the form of water-based sexual lubricant.\n\nThe chain of events started with a claim that Shkreli had purchased the exclusive rights Kanye West’s new album, “The Life of Pablo” for $15 million. In and of itself, this is believable, after all he had previously purchased exclusive rights to a previously unreleased Wu Tang Clan album, “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.”\n\nWe’ll let Shkrelli’s sweary tweets tell you how it all went down.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MartinShkreli/status/698750951889506305\n\nNothing to see here, just an extremely bright guy meeting a dude that claims to be friends with Kanye and then sending him $15 million in bitcoin. No big deal, right?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MartinShkreli/status/698748496153866240\n\nOh, snap. Daquan wasn’t really Daquan? So, we’re supposed to believe that people lie on the internet?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MartinShkreli/status/698749973769363456\n\nNo worries, man. You’re a smart dude. You’ll figure out something. I’m sure of it.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MartinShkreli/status/698899227141869572\n\nOh, good. He just tracked down the guy that nobody on the planet can track down and asked him for his money back. Luckily, it seems that not only did he find him, ‘Sitoshi’ (sic) is going to reverse a transaction in bitcoin, something previously thought to be impossible.\n\nIf you believed any of this, shame on you. Bitcoin transactions are easily verifiable, and according to the blockchain, there were no single transactions, or a group of transactions, around this time that matched up with Shkreli’s 37,000 bitcoin loss.\n\nThe internet giveth, and it taketh away. Moments after Shkreli’s Twitter rant, he hosted a live chat (now with 300 percent more bad acting) that kept the party going. In the video chat, Shkreli left a credit card exposed; it didn’t go unnoticed.\n\nA 4chan user took notice and did what 4chan does, delivered swift justice. In this case, the justice was in the form of a special delivery to Shkreli’s home address.\n\nThe delivery? 55-gallons of water-based lubricant for a cool $1,100.\n\nNo word on why he didn’t opt for overnight shipping.\n\nRead next: Kotlin, the 'pragmatic' language for Android and JVM, has reached its 1.0 release"", 'Can bitcoin build remittance systems that will lift the unbanked out of poverty in developing countries? Will the blockchain deliver the infrastructure to provide property rights and financial inclusion to the disenfranchised?\n\nThese questions draw diverse opinions among cryptocurrency observers and economic development experts worldwide. The answers are not immediate, given the youth of bitcoin and blockchain technology, but the journey to finding them promises to be exciting.\n\nBrett Scott, an independent researcher and consultant on alternative finance and financial reform, has authored an analysis of these topics in a paper released this month for the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD), an autonomous, Geneva-based U.N. research institute. The paper is titled, “How Can Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology Play a Role in Building Social and Solidarity Finance”?\n\nScott, a senior fellow of the Finance Innovation Lab in London, summarizes efforts to use bitcoin and the blockchain in improving some of the world’s most pressing economic problems. He also examines the challenges of financial inclusion within the context of techno-libertarian evangelism and techno-colonial solutionism ideologies.\n\nThe potential for bitcoin and the blockchain to empower social and solidarity-based finance has yet to be truly tested, Scott notes at the outset. His 25-page paper is intended as a primer on the basics of bitcoin and the current narratives about its potential to facilitate financial inclusion, remittances, cooperative structures and micro-insurance systems.\n\nScott notes that while the community around crypto technology is enthusiastic and experimental, it remains prone to an elitist, tech-centric outlook. An important role for social and solidarity finance practitioners is to consider how blockchain technology can evolve within today’s diverse political and cultural contexts.\n\nAt the conclusion of the paper, Scott offers suggestions for further research in bitcoin and blockchain technologies.\n\nPart 1: Bitcoin And The Unbanked\n\nA discursive bitcoin theme is whether it can apply within the context of international development, financial inclusion and bottom-of-the-pyramid business efforts. Narratives on why it may be empowering populations in less developed nations have emerged, including:\n\nAs a means to facilitate low-cost remittances for those seeking to transfer small amounts of money internationally.\n\nAs a means for an otherwise excluded individual to have a decentralized global bank account, accessible by downloading an open source wallet from the Internet, versus having to set up an account with a financial institution.\n\nProviding the basis for a richer set of financial services.\n\nBitcoin has served as an intermediary between more dominant currencies, making it useful for remittances. A Filipino worker in New York can use a remittance service to transfer U.S. dollars into bitcoins and allow a family member in the Philippines to “withdraw” pesos on the other side. For this model to work, a liquid market for both dollars-to-bitcoins, and bitcoins-to-pesos is necessary. Startups like Rebit in the Philippines and BitPesa in Kenya offer existing examples.\n\nBitcoin has also shown potential to facilitate small-scale global commerce. A producer of sustainable cocoa butter can sell his products to U.S. clients in exchange for bitcoin tokens, and then redeem them for local—or foreign—currency on a bitcoin exchange.\n\nBitcoin can serve as a banking service. A mobile phone can download a bitcoin wallet, providing access to the global market. In a country with a poor a banking infrastructure, such a technology could be a safer way to hold money, and a convenient way to use it in everyday transactions.\n\nHowever, there appears to be little more than anecdotal evidence on the extent to which such uses of bitcoin is occurring.\n\nM-PESA has established itself as a leading mobile banking service in Kenya, enabling nearly a quarter of the working population to use mobile phones to transfer currency by using text messages. The politics of mobile banking are problematic, however, involving struggles among regulators, banks and telecoms companies.\n\nWhy Some Are Skeptical\n\nWhile these possibilities generate enthusiasm among cryptocurrency observers, there are skeptics, many of whom are well-intended. Skeptics come from different ideologies.\n\nTraditional conservatives argue that bitcoin-based systems will be used for money laundering and financing terrorists. In July 2015, Hacking Team — producers of government surveillance spyware — were reportedly working on cracking bitcoin systems on behalf of government clients. Hence, there is a geopolitics of bitcoin that can prevent it from being used freely for financial inclusion.\n\nOthers point out practical considerations that would undermine bitcoin’s use in facilitating remittances. Remittances depend on a liquid market between bitcoin and the recipient country’s currency. Liquid currency markets tend to develop in countries with strong market institutions and well-established local intermediaries. Countries that depend on remittances tend not to have such institutions for their normal currency, not to mention an entirely new Internet currency.\n\nKenya’s M-PESA succeeded because it leveraged an existing network of agents and vendors. Bitcoin does not escape the need for extensive networks of agents in remote locations who can provide physical cash to those seeking remittances in a local currency. There are also questions about the viability of bitcoin in countries with poor technology infrastructure.\n\nFinancial exclusion generally refers to not having access to credit, which reflects a lack of stable income streams or access to recognized property titles to act as collateral.\n\nHence, financial inclusion operates on multiple fronts. Bitcoin has yet to prove itself on any of these fronts. It offers a potential alternative payments system, but it has yet to show how it will deliver financial inclusion more broadly.\n\nThe Political Critique\n\nThere is also a more political critique of bitcoin’s role in developing economies.\n\nThose viewing bitcoin as a “life-raft” currency imply that it is desirable to “escape to the Internet” rather than find more fundamental solutions to a country’s underlying problems. Advocating that a vulnerable country adopt bitcoin could be merely a short-term solution and one that distracts from strengthening already fragile institutions.\n\nIn a country like Zimbabwe, the real need may be to strengthen the integrity of the banking system, which can only be achieved by long-term political battles.\n\nEscaping weak local institutions might help certain individuals, but it does little to empower the majority who continue to rely on the existing systems. Those most likely to seek escape are social elites with access to technology, high education and capital to protect.\n\nBitcoin’s Neocolonial Tinge\n\nThe rhetoric of cryptocurrency superiority even carries neocolonial tinges. Does “forget your local systems, rely on our technology” encourage local elites within fragile countries? Such is the narrative of many Western tech gurus.\n\nSuch technologists view technology as a market-driven force for problem-solving. Such a “solutionist” lens views the world in apolitical terms as a series of things that have been solved and things that remain to be solved with technology. This narrative is top-down in nature—it postulates the problems of people in poorer countries can be solved by Stanford graduates.\n\nOn the contrary, technology does not operate in a vacuum. Solution are sold by particular people and accepted by particular people within particular contexts.\n\nThe financial inclusion, microcredit and “the unbanked” narratives often have the same solutionist ethos. Is financial exclusion an avoidable problem in need of a profitable technological solution, or is it an inherent part of an unequal economic system?\n\nShould the real goal be bringing the marginalized into the normal financial markets, or should it be on creating alternative institutions based on principles of social solidarity?\n\nMuch of the bitcoin community is ambivalent on this question. Bitcoin is an alternative, but is it merely an alternative to business-as-usual?\n\nConservative Libertarianism\n\nCryptocurrencies, in general, have been associated with the hyper-individualism of conservative libertarianism. Some adherents of this philosophy see cryptocurrency as a more efficient means of supporting trade within a pure capitalist model.\n\nSome such champions of cryptocurrency argue that the financial sector exploits customers. Rather than viewing this as a normal feature of profit-driven business within a naturally political marketplace, they see the problem as an infringement of the political into an imagined apolitical realm of the market.\n\nThe banks abuse because they are intertwined with the political system, which undermines what would otherwise be a neutral free market. They see cryptocurrency technology as a way to disintermediate them.\n\nLeftist Libertarianism\n\nThose with a more left-wing libertarian impulse find cryptocurrency interesting since it allows for peer-to-peer collaboration and non-hierarchal, self-organization within a communitarian structure. Hence, there are attempts to build cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange for cooperative enterprises existing outside the logic of normal market processes.\n\nFaircoin, spearheaded by Fair.Coop and started by Spanish activist Enric Duran, is such an example. It is an attempt to create a global cryptocurrency for transfers among a global cooperative network. It could conceivably back more local mutual credit systems.\n\nThis approach runs contrary to financial inclusion narratives claiming that economic inequality is due to external factors undermining the efficient workings of markets. Faircoin’s vision is to build networks of solidarity-based collaboration using technology. It is in allowing such “collaboration at scale” that cryptocurrency becomes a force for radical economic alternatives.\n\nPar 2: Blockchain 2.0\n\nThe blockchain stands at the cutting edge of much innovation involving bitcoin.\n\n“Smart contracts,” which are small bundles of code that record on a blockchain, allow participants to interact and undertake simple tasks.\n\nA coded blockchain-based script can activate when two parties send bitcoins to an escrow account controlled by the script and release the bitcoins to whoever wins a bet on the average level of rainfall over a certain period. This arrangement describes a blockchain-based weather derivatives contract.\n\nSuch simple building-block contracts can form the basis of more complex, multi-stage or multi-function entities, referred to as decentralized autonomous organizations.\n\nBlockchain Land Registries\n\nOne aspect of blockchain systems that has captured the attention of those with a free-market economics orientation is the way they can record property rights.\n\nCountries with weak governance and record-keeping systems have a problem of double-registry of land, land title fraud or uncertain title to land. The blockchain could potentially address such issues with a system that records land title in a public manner.\n\nIn 2015, Honduras announced a contract with American company Factom to develop a blockchain-based land registry.\n\nBy providing titles to property, property title can serve as collateral, enabling cheaper bank lending to informal entrepreneurs.\n\nBut it will only work if both the property and contract are well protected, capitalization and market processes will lift people out of poverty and yield the hidden value of informal economies.\n\nIt is not clear that such registries solve underlying problems. Areas with uncertain land title tend to have weak institutions that give rise to the uncertainty in the first place. Merely presenting a technology that can record claims accomplishes little unless there are strong legal institutions that recognize the recorded blockchain claims, and strong procedures for those who make the claims.\n\nBlockchain ‘Missionaries’\n\nTechno-libertarian evangelism — blockchain “missionaries” — have emerged in developing countries articulating a markets-as-savior and technology-as-savior gospel with an anti-state message. A group in Ghana called Africa Youth Peace Call organized a 2015 Blockchain Land Title Summer Liberty and Entrepreneurship Camp to address how the land registry can move from state institutions to blockchain ledgers.\n\nBitnation, a group offering a techno-libertarian message, has presented a vision of hosting completely alternative state institutions (such as security and legal institutions) on blockchain systems. The vision describes states as governance service providers that might be outcompeted by technological platforms.\n\nBitnation foresees a world where one could “opt out” of states and “buy into” new governance institutions. But this vision of a “market in governance services” only works if markets can exist prior to political governance systems. Others argue that markets themselves are underpinned by political governance systems that uphold the property rights enabling them to exist in the first place.\n\nWhile the technological novelty of blockchain is exciting, the more extreme rhetoric has hinged on “fixing” human imperfection, rather than accommodating it.\n\nAlso read: ‘60 Minutes’ highlights how mobile payments service M-Pesa has changed life in Kenya\n\nBlockchain As Trust-Enabling\n\nAnother trend — found in groups like Ethereum, Swarm, and Blockstream — characterizes blockchain technology as trust-enabling. Blockstream claims to “transform global systems of value exchange that, by design, make it possible to trust anyone.” In removing the need to trust central authorities, blockchains could be platforms on which build new forms of non-hierarchal cooperation between strangers.\n\nWhile one can characterize modern money as either atomizing and alienating or as trust-enabling between two strangers, the strangers need to trust in the state institutions. It is this latter point that blockchain proponents initially focus on.\n\nThe original libertarian blockchain evangelists focused on blockchain systems eliminating the need for trusted central intermediaries.\n\nThe conservative libertarian vision, however, goes further to imply that the reason centralized institutional systems are flawed is that they are controlled by untrustworthy and self-interested humans.\n\nIn this context, the blockchain’s cryptographic apolitical purity emerges not just as a way to stop abusive people who control institutions, but as a way to resolve the problem of how to establish contractual relationships among untrustworthy human beings.\n\nThe Anarchist Reading\n\nIt is possible to create a communitarian anarchist reading of the same technology. Social anarchist (or libertarian socialist) conceptions do not position human nature as fundamentally self-interested, but rather assert that people become alienated and corrupted within the hierarchies and power dynamics of capitalist system institutions.\n\nAnarchist traditions have advocated the need for smaller-scale, non-hierarchical systems where people can experience their social and interdependent nature, and thereby achieve emancipation.\n\nBlockchain systems can offer a vision of large-scale, egalitarian self-organization beyond the scale of ordinary anarchist attempts of cooperative communes.\n\nThe goal is to replace hierarchal, centralized institutions with decentralized ones.\n\nHow such organizations will end up looking remains to be seen, but they may deliver a new form to explore in the quest to build social and solidarity-based finance.\n\nCan a network of street vendors run a collective mutual insurance pool using only their smartphones to interact with a distributed ledger system, with no central financial institution? Can a regional mutual credit system — effectively a ledger of credits and debits — exist in a decentralized blockchain form?\n\nThe technology is new, but it offers empowering uses in certain contexts.\n\nWhere To Go From Here\n\nA good starting point would be to build new research into the following areas:\n\nThe ongoing development and deepening of global bitcoin markets, tracing to what extent those in developing countries are adopting it. The challenges and potentials for the bitcoin system’s usage from a financial inclusion perspective. This includes its use as a remittance system and as an alternative bank account. The extent to which bitcoin as a currency system could interact with blockchain 2.0, smart-contract technology to create collectively-run (and solidarity-based) financial schemes that do not rely on normal financial institutions.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Hackers have siphoned about $103,000 out of Bitcoin accounts that were protected with an alternative security measure, according to research that tracked six years\' worth of transactions. Account-holders used easy-to-remember passwords to protect their accounts instead of the long cryptographic keys normally required.\n\nThe heists were carried out against almost 900 accounts where the owners used passwords to generate the private encryption keys required to withdraw funds. In many cases, the vulnerable accounts were drained within minutes or seconds of going live. The electronic wallets were popularly known as ""brain wallets"" because, the thinking went, Bitcoin funds were stored in users\' minds through memorization of a password rather than a 64-character private key that had to be written on paper or stored digitally. For years, brain wallets were promoted as a safer and more user-friendly way to secure Bitcoins and other digital currencies, although Gregory Maxwell, Gavin Andresen, and many other Bitcoin experts had long warned that they were a bad idea.\n\nThe security concerns were finally proven once and for all last August when Ryan Castellucci, a researcher with security firm White Ops, presented research at the Defcon hacker convention that showed how easy it was to attack brain wallets at scale. Brain wallets used no cryptographic salt and passed plaintext passwords through a single hash iteration (in this case, the SHA256 function), a shortcoming that made it possible for attackers to crack large numbers of brain wallet passwords at once. Worse, a form of the insecurely hashed passwords are stored in the Bitcoin blockchain, providing all the material needed to compromise the accounts.\n\nBy contrast, Google, Facebook, and virtually all other security-conscious services protect passwords by storing them in cryptographic form that\'s been passed through a hash function, typically tens of thousands of times or more, a process known as key stretching that greatly increases the time and resources required by crackers. The services also use cryptographic salt, a measure that requires each hash to be processed separately to prevent the kind of mass cracking Castellucci did. Security-conscious services also go to great lengths to keep password hashes confidential, a secrecy that\'s not possible with Bitcoin because of the transparency provided by the blockchain.\n\nBrain drain\n\nAccording to a recently published research paper, the brain wallet vulnerability was known widely enough to have been regularly exploited by real attackers going after real accounts. Over a six-year span that ended last August, attackers used the cracking technique to drain 884 brain wallet accounts of 1,806 bitcoins. Based on the value of each coin at the time the theft took place, the value of the purloined coins was $103,000.\n\n""Our results reveal the existence of an active attacker community that rapidly steals funds from vulnerable brain wallets in nearly all cases we identify,"" the paper authors wrote. ""In total, approximately $100K worth of bitcoin has been loaded into brain wallets, with the ten most valuable wallets accounting for over three-quarters of the total value. Many brain wallets are drained within minutes, and while those storing larger values are emptied faster, nearly all wallets are drained within 24 hours.""\n\nThe paper, titled ""The Bitcoin Brain Drain: A Short Paper on the Use and Abuse of Bitcoin Brain Wallets,"" is scheduled to be presented later this month at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2016 conference. Its publication comes about six months after Brainwallet.org, the most widely used Bitcoin-based brain wallet service, permanently ceased operations. The service voluntarily shut down following the Defcon presentation by Castellucci, who is one of the authors of the most recent paper.\n\nFurther Reading How the Bible and YouTube are fueling the next frontier of password cracking To identify brain wallets and then crack them, the research team compiled 300 billion password candidates taken from more than 20 lists, including the Urban Dictionary, the English language Wikipedia, the seminal plaintext password leak from the RockYou gaming website, and other large online compromises. By collecting words and entire phrases from a wide body of sources, the researchers employed a technique Ars covered in 2013 that allowed them to crack words and phrases many people would have considered to be strong passwords. Cracked passphrases included ""say hello to my little friend,"" ""yohohoandabottleofrum,"" and ""dudewheresmycar.""\n\nThe researchers ran each password candidate through the SHA256 function to derive a list of potential private keys for Bitcoin addresses used by brain wallets. They then used a cryptographic operation based on elliptic curves to find the public key corresponding to each potential private key. Since the Bitcoin blockchain contains the public key of every account wallet, it was easy to know when a password guess was used by a real Bitcoin user.\n\nThe paper reported that vulnerable accounts were often drained within minutes of going live, and in an interview, Castellucci said that some accounts were liquidated in seconds. Castellucci said he suspects the speed was the result of attackers who used large precomputed tables containing millions or billions of potential passwords. While many of the attackers who drained vulnerable accounts earned paltry sums for their work, the top four drainers netted about a total of $35,000 among them. Meanwhile, the drainer who emptied the most brain wallets—about 100 in all—made $3,219.\n\nThe thefts were often chronicled in online forums, where participants would report that their Bitcoin wallets had mysteriously been emptied. For a while, people assuming the role of a digital Robin Hood claimed to crack vulnerable wallets, drain them of their contents, and then wait for the victim to publicly complain of the theft on Reddit or various bitcoin forums. The Robin Hood and Little John hackers would then claim to return the funds once the victim proved control of the compromised private key.\n\nWhile plenty of people publicly warned of risks of brain wallets over the years, the vulnerability was often dismissed as theoretical by some. Brain wallets are now generally shunned by Bitcoin users, but Castellucci warned that an alternative crypto currency known as Ethereum can use a brain wallet scheme that\'s every bit as weak as the Bitcoin one was. He is withholding details for now in the hopes that Ethereum brain wallets will soon be abandoned.', 'Brian Armstrong, CEO and co-founder of Coinbase, claims bitcoin is upgrading rather than splitting on account of Bitcoin Classic, and he’s willing to bet anyone $5,000 that he’s right. Armstrong, writing on Medium, said hard forks are one of the most important bitcoin innovations and having multiple teams working on the bitcoin protocol is a positive thing.\n\nHe said he is willing to bet $5,000 USD payable in any equivalent amount of fiat or crypto currency to the charity of the winner’s choice that bitcoin’s first hard fork will be an upgrade of a single currency, not a split, and all will work out fine. The bet extends to any public bitcoin figure or tech willing to accept it. Should more than one person accept, Armstrong will choose the challenger.\n\nWho Will Accept The Bet?\n\nArmstrong said his bet is mostly for fun, but he wants to see how many people are willing to put their money where their mouth is. As for why he didn’t denominate the bet in BTC, he said he doesn’t want people to think he’s trying to “game” it. If he wins the bet, the bitcoin price will likely rise and if he loses, the price will likely fall. The bet is payable in BTC but the price is denominated in USD.\n\nArmstrong tweeted in November that Coinbase would include Bitcoin Classic as a means to block confirmation by running Bitcoin Classic nodes, CCN reported. He tweeted this following the fork’s announcement of a new code that pushes for doubling the blocksize to 2MB.\n\nIn response to Armstrong’s announcement at the time, some wanted him to clarify if Coinbase was switching to Bitcoin Classic as the primary running node going forward. Armstrong replied that Coinbase’s integration of Bitcoin Classic would be in tandem with several node types implemented by the company.\n\nArmstrong Clarifies His Position\n\nConcerning his newly-announced wager, Armstrong attempted to define “works out fine.” To win his bet, he sets three conditions.\n\n1. At the moment the network forks, 95% or more of hashing power will be on one chain. This will hold true regardless of the threshold used to trigger the upgrade. Bitcoin Classic uses a 75% threshold and other forks can use a lower threshold, but 95% or more will be on a single chain at the time the network upgrades.\n\n2. At the moment of the fork, 95% or more of all merchant and consumer wallet firms (by the number of users) and exchanges (by trading volume) will support the new version. This could be hard to measure, but one can look at public numbers of users for merchant and wallet software as well as trading volume for most exchanges.\n\n3. Two days following the upgrade taking effect, the bitcoin price will exceed what it was one month prior to the fork taking place.\n\nArmstrong said the fork he defines is the longest bitcoin chain measured by the amount of hashing power done on it that originates from Satoshi’s genesis block. He defines the moment of network upgrades to be the time when the proposed change occurs.\n\nAs an example, mining can begin with a vote for Bitcoin Classic, but it is not until 751 of the last 1,000 blocks get mined with a vote as well as the elapse of a 28-day grace period that the change goes into effect and 2MB blocks can begin joining the longest chain.\n\nIn such a case, it is not before the 2MB blocks join the chain that he claims the upgrade has occurred.\n\nBet Good For 12 Months\n\nLastly, Armstrong limits the bet to the first hard fork occurring in the next 12 months from the date of his post. “I think there will be at least one during that time, but if not I don’t want to leave this bet going on forever. If no hard fork occurs during that time, then there is no winner.”\n\nArmstrong thanked tech blogger Sam Altman for inspiring the bet. Altman offered a bet about certain tech company valuations five years from now.\n\nCoinbase’s move to run Bitcoin Classic comes at a time when the debate concerning bitcoin’s block size is moving toward a bottleneck with lines are being drawn in the bitcoin community. Bitcoin’s mining pools, collectively representing 70% of the total hashing power of the bitcoin network, rejected the hard fork.\n\nIn the space of a week, the number of Bitcoin Classic nodes grew 700% following the release of its new updated code which allows for doubling the size of a block.\n\nImage from Shutterstock and Facebook/TechCrunch.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has concluded that Australian banks did not collude in blocking services for bitcoin firms and that a full investigation into the affair is not necessary.\n\nAccording to the Australian Financial Review, ACCC chairman Rod Sims wrote to Senator Matthew Canavan of The National Party of Australia – the Queensland representative who had originally requested an investigation into the matter – saying there was no evidence that banks had colluded before closing bank accounts held by bitcoin companies.\n\nSims further wrote that the commission\'s inquiry had found that the banks had acted on an individual basis ""in order to ensure their ability to meet their regulatory obligations and manage their risk"".\n\nColluding over the account closures would have seen the banks acting in contravention of the 2010 Competition and Consumer Act and its provisions against cartels.\n\nThe AFR reports Sims as writing:\n\n""The available material also suggests that banks have made their decisions at different times, and with different outcomes.""\n\nHe cited examples of one bank deciding to not deal with digital currency businesses in 2011, while a different bank came to the same decision in June 2015.\n\nFurther, some banks are still providing services to digital currency companies on a case-by-case basis, Sims said.\n\nInquiry criticised\n\nHowever, the AFR reports that both bitcoin companies and Labor Senator Sam Dastyari have criticised the ACCC\'s findings, saying it had not properly investigated the issue since it had failed to reach out to the companies whose accounts were closed.\n\nSims rejected that suggestion, however, telling the news source that the commission had communicated with some of the affected companies.\n\nFurther, he said the banks had given investigators access to documents and had provided credible explanations about the account closures.\n\nThe ACCC had therefore come to the decision that there was no need to launch a full investigation.\n\nAn inquiry was originally called for by Senator Canavan in October 2015, when he urged the ACCC to investigate whether the banks had acted in an anti-competitive manner after abruptly closing the accounts of some 17 bitcoin businesses, including Bit Trade and Buyabitcoin.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Hackers target financial institutions and online shopping platforms in an attempt to breach their databases. Bank records of over one million consumers can be bought on the Internet for next to nothing. Bitcoin is among the accepted payment methods, although the bigger problem is how lackluster data protection allows for these breaches to take place.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Price Watch; 400 Broken!\n\nCredit Card Information For Sale\n\nCybersecurity is becoming a key point of focus for nearly any business in the world today, as hackers are becoming far more aggressive when it comes to breaching databases and stealing consumer details. When those details are sold on the internet – publicly, not on the dark web – things go from bad to worse in a heartbeat.\n\nDebit and credit card data is a prime target for hackers, as there is a growing demand in the criminal circuit for this type of information. This is particularly the case if hackers manage to obtain more sensitive information as well, including mother’s maiden names and social security numbers. With this arsenal of information, hackers can bypass most of the bank security questions, and wreak further havoc.\n\nBestvalid.cc is the website claiming to sell information, including credit card numbers, social security numbers, birthdates, and much more. What makes this story even more worrying is how the website has been selling this type of information for more than six months and has still not been taken down by law enforcement.\n\nBut that is not all, as Bestvalid is offering credit card “packages” to its customers as well. Some of these packages will include most common answers to bank security questions. Customers who purchase a package and find the information is not working will be eligible for refunds. Selling credit card information has become a major business on the Internet as of late.\n\nThe bigger concern is how so many sites prove to be vulnerable to these types of attacks. British ISP TalkTalk was hacked not too long ago, and financial information of thousands of consumers had been exposed to the assault. TalkTalk also failed to adequately encrypt a lot of consumer data, which did not help matters either.\n\nUnlike most of the other online marketplaces for sensitive consumer financial information, Bestvalid is operating in the open. A lot of people are questioning why law enforcement has not undertaken any effort to have this website shut down over the past eight months. It goes without saying this lackluster attitude by government officials is not sitting well with the general public.\n\nBestvalid.cc Accepts Bitcoin Payments\n\nOnline criminals prefer payment methods that will hide their real identity from the public at large. Based on many mainstream media articles, Bitcoin provides hackers with exactly this functionality, even though anyone in the world can trace a transaction on the blockchain without too much effort. However, that transaction does not expose someone’s identity immediately.\n\nThis is where government officials and law enforcement run into some trouble, as they perceive Bitcoin as a currency that can not be traced. Unfortunately for them, Bitcoin can be traced easily, as all of the funds movements are logged on the blockchain in real-time. Tracking where the funds are going to takes a few seconds, which will lead the investigation to an exchange wallet if the hackers try to cash out their bitcoins.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin proves yet again why it is such a viable alternative to traditional finance. Unlike credit and debit card payments, there is no sensitive user data transmitted when making payments. This does not mean users cannot include their details if they want to, but rather how this is not done automatically. Moreover, Bitcoin transactions do not contain information that can be used to mimic payments, as the private key associated with each address is not transmitted during the payment.\n\nSource: Telegraph UK', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

But it has taken about 10 years for China to do the same thing,” he said.\n\nXiaochuan suggested that if its digital currency was phased into the economy, it could become gradually more expensive to transact in paper-based money, thereby motivating users to make the transition.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that the switch was likely to be slow, concluding:\n\n”With the transaction costs of paper money rising, people will be motivated to opt more for digital money. But digital currency and cash will co-exist for a long time.”\n\nImage via golddc / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

02/16/2016,"['On Tuesday, IBM announced that it’s been working to make blockchain technology—which was refined and popularized by Bitcoin—easier for businesses to use for financial and non-financial purposes. Specifically, the company is launching what it’s calling “blockchain-as-a-service,” or a set of tools for ""creating, deploying, running, and monitoring blockchain applications on the IBM Cloud.”\n\nFurther Reading Nine major banks working on Bitcoin-like block chain tech for market trading The idea of applying blockchain technology outside of the realm of Bitcoin has gained a lot of interest from forward-thinking companies in the past year or so. Blockchain applications are also called “distributed ledger technology” because they remove the need for a centralized database and, like Bitcoin, give every transaction in a particular system a cryptographic hash that can be checked by any member of the group.\n\nTraditional financial institutions as well as startups hoping to serve those banks and stock exchanges have been among the first to glom onto the idea that a decentralized ledger could be used to make money transfer more reliable and more secure. If all parties can double check money transfers (even if they don’t know what was exchanged in the transfer), then theoretically, errors caused by mistake or malice could be reduced. Recently nine banking institutions including JP Morgan, BBVA, and Credit Suisse partnered with a company called R3 to work on decentralizing some databases. At the World Economic Forum in Davos this January, MasterCard officials said that the credit card network was carefully studying how to best apply blockchain concepts.\n\nBut IBM is targeting its new blockchain efforts not only at potential financial-industry customers, but at a variety of logistics customers as well. IBM spokesperson Holli Haswell told Ars that a good example for a non-monetary use of a distributed ledger could be shipping. If a business is trying to ship food across the county, the companies in contract with one another could “apply contract resolution and auditing to the blockchain if for instance a shipment of food is spoiled, allowing you to see the temperature of the cargo container throughout the shipping process.” In such a scenario, shipments would be outfitted with RFID tags and sensors that could record temperature, location, and any number of other statistics that could be reported back to the distributed ledger.\n\n""It is a single source of truth that can be shared among all parties that could be applied to a lot of different industries,” Haswell said of blockchain technology.\n\n""When all participants in an interaction have an up-to-date ledger that reflects the most recent transactions or changes, this allows organizations to cut out intermediaries and settle contracts or transactions much faster,"" Haswell added. ""Speed, visibility, and having an immutable record are the primary business reasons blockchain could make sense in some industry applications.""\n\nIBM also reported that it has contributed significant resources to developing standards for blockchain use with Hyper Ledger, an open-source Linux Foundation Collaborative Project. Although the IBM spokesperson declined to comment on how much money IBM has put toward the effort, the company did note that it devoted 35 researchers and software engineers to writing 44,000 lines of code for the Hyper Ledger project.', 'Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

They will propose no policies and will not follow their consciences, but will support or block legislation at the direction of their members, who can swap or trade their votes on every bill online.\n\n“If they didn’t have to be senators, if they could just be software or robots they would be, because their only purpose is to do what the people want them to do,” Flux Party co-founder Max Kaye told Reuters in an interview.\n\nAustralia is set to hold an election in September or October after a period of turmoil that brought five prime ministers in as many years.\n\nAt the same time the upper house, which thanks to the quirks of its electoral system has a history of returning mavericks and fringe party candidates, has been hopelessly deadlocked by a handful of senators, at least one elected on less than 1 percent of the vote.\n\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last week raised the possibility of calling an early poll to break the gridlock that has held up the government’s legislative agenda.\n\nThat type of policy inertia is what bitcoin enthusiasts Kaye and Flux co-founder Nathan Spataro say inspired them to explore alternative systems that better represent the world of 2016.\n\nBitcoin is a web-based “cryptocurrency” used to move money around quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority. The technology behind it is called the blockchain - a massive electronic ledger of every transaction that is verified and shared by a global network of computers.\n\nTo Spataro and Kaye, bitcoin is not just an alternative financial system: it is the missing link between representative democracy and Democracy 2.0.\n\n“This ancient system we’ve got of representative democracy, which at the time liberated us from monarchies and was awesome, now we’re at a point where it’s become this monster,” Spataro said.\n\n“We’re in a society now that’s got the Internet and when democracy in its current form was conceived, you had to sail on a ship from England to get here. This model wasn’t designed for this world.”\n\n“DELIGHTFULLY NAIVE”\n\nMax Kaye (R) and Nathan Spataro, co-founders of The Flux Party, a new Australian political party, talk as they sit on couches in an office building in central Sydney, Australia, February 13, 2016. REUTERS/David Gray\n\nBitcoin’s strength comes from its ability to build trust through ease of verification and by removing human frailty from the equation, said Dr. Adrian Lee, an expert on bitcoin at the University of Technology Sydney.\n\nThat makes what the Flux Party is proposing both unique and also potentially fraught.\n\n“I haven’t seen a party which would vote via blockchain,” Lee said. “If you removed the politician and made it just a bitcoin machine, then maybe it would work but you can’t do that,” he said, noting the absence of a legally binding mechanism to make Flux senators vote as directed.\n\nAlthough the party’s architecture for calculating and distributing voters’ wishes to their elected officials uses highly complex computer code, the overall idea is fairly simple.\n\nMax Kaye (R) and Nathan Spataro, co-founders of The Flux Party, a new Australian political party, talk as they sit on couches in an office building in central Sydney, Australia, February 13, 2016.

Under their system, the Flux Party founders say, large blocs of voters could effectively grant their vote on such issues to a scientist or economist.\n\n“You get sick, you go to the doctor, right? You don’t self-diagnose and you don’t go and call your plumber,” Kaye said.\n\nThe Party filed its registration papers with the Australian Election Commission last month after obtaining the requisite support of at least 550 registered voters. Its website currently puts its membership at 1,009 people.\n\nAttempting to apply the transformative power of the Internet to democratic systems is not a new one, said Peter Chen, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Sydney, who called the Flux Party “delightfully naive people”.\n\n“They’re just the modern version of something that’s always been around: utopian political system designers,” he said.\n\n“They’re obviously guys who are really focused on the tech thing and that has always been the problem with the e-democracy people. They’re often really tech-driven and they need political scientists at the brainstorming floor to say ‘well, I don’t know if that’d work’.”', 'Bitcoin. Image: Antana/Flickr\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is requesting more than $10 million in penalties from the bitcoin mining firms GAW Miners and ZenMiner, after CEO Joshua Homero Garza failed to respond to fraud charges against the embattled companies.\n\nIn December, the SEC charged Garza and his companies with defrauding investors in a Ponzi scheme. Garza had claimed the companies were using hardware to mine Bitcoin, a process that uses large amounts of computer power to solve puzzles that verify and secure Bitcoin transactions. Computers that find the correct solutions are given a prize—bitcoin currency—for solving them, of which Garza promised a portion to his customers.\n\nIn reality, Garza devoted ""little or no computing power toward any mining activity,"" according to the SEC. Instead he paid customers with funds from his other ventures, including Bitcoin exchange Paybase, which imploded in April of 2015.\n\nGarza had guaranteed that customer mining contracts with GAW and ZenMiner, which he community called Hashlets, would make a profit. The company sold at least $19 million Hashlets to more than 10,000 investors, most of which never recovered their full investments, and very few who made a profit.\n\nAfter Garza declined to respond to these charges, the SEC filed a motion on Friday for a default penalty of $10,384,099 against the firms, including $10,078,331 in penalties plus prejudgement interest. The filing targets the companies specifically, as Garza has requested an extension to respond to charges filed against him personally.\n\n""GAW Miners, often through its CEO Garza, also made a number of false and misleading statements to investors and potential investors about its and ZenMiner\'s virtual currency Mining operations,"" the SEC wrote.\n\nIt is still unclear where Garza is today, as he waived his motion of summons in this case, and it has been suggested that he has fled the country. Garza\'s lawyer Marjorie Peerce declined to comment on the case, or the whereabouts of her client.', 'Up until this point, FinCEN has clearly defined projects related to digital currency and Bitcoin do not fall in the same category as prepaid access sellers or providers.\n\nThe Bitcoin Classic hard fork solution could lead to legal trouble down the line. Or that was the assumption at least, even though no one was able to confirm this statement at that time. An interesting question was raised, though, and the answer will put a lot of people’s mind at ease: the current FinCEN guidelines will not get developers in legal trouble.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Price Watch; Let’s get some upside!\n\nNo FinCEN Implications For Bitcoin Developers\n\nMost of this discussion started from the point of view that hard forking Bitcoin would make Bitcoin Classic a separate money services business. After all, the bitcoins mined on that blockchain would be far different from any other bitcoin found on the Bitcoin Core blockchain. But whereas the latter is abiding by FinCEN regulations and guidelines, Bitcoin Classic is not.\n\nAs it turns out, there is no reason to worry about FinCEN implications if the Bitcoin Classic hard fork would occur. Some people considered the option of legal consequences for the project developers, all of whom are publicly listed on the website. But as it turns out, there is no reason to worry about any implications just yet.\n\nBased on the information found in the current FinCEN regulation draft – created back in 2013 – there is no need to assume hard forking Bitcoin would make the new solution a money services business. No administrator is overseeing the Bitcoin protocol for FinCEN regulations, which also removes the need for developers to register as a money transmitter.\n\nUp until this point, FinCEN has clearly defined projects related to digital currency and Bitcoin do not fall into the same category as prepaid access sellers or providers. Additionally, digital currency exchanges are not labelled as foreign exchanges either, and there are absolutely no ties with postal offices or checks in any way.\n\nHowever, a separate set of rules has been drawn up in 2013, specifically targeting Bitcoin and digital currency projects. As a result, of these guidelines, several activities related to Bitcoin and digital currency can be classified as money transmission. Among these listed activities are “exchanging” and “administering”. Luckily, neither developers nor miners fall into either category and are in the clear.\n\nWalking A Fine Line\n\nKeeping in mind how miners are not involved in the process of transmitting or accepting the digital currency, they are entirely exempt from the FinCEN guidelines. Bitcoin is not issued by a bank or does not come in the form of checks. It is important to keep in mind this situation is not affected by the number of miners on the Bitcoin network.\n\nSoftware developers fall into the same boat as Bitcoin miners, as they are not responsible for accepting or transmitting money. Production of software is not related to being a money service business, even if that code would make it easier to sell digital currency. But that does not mean this situation will not change in the years to come.\n\nFinCEN regulators could take a keen interest in this ongoing block size debate, and decide to come up with a different set of rules for the future. Both miners and developers could then be affected by these new guidelines, and it is impossible to predict what the consequences could be. The outcome could be either positive or negative for Bitcoin, miners, and developers, depending on how this block size debate turns out.\n\nSource: Coin Center', 'Mining for Bitcoin may take tremendous amounts of time and computing power these days, but new hardware which uses error finding technology could boost the output of mining operations by as much as 30 percent.\n\nThe cryptocurrency Bitcoin has surged in popularity over the past few years. Once upon a time, you could buy hundreds of coins belonging to the virtual currency for a pittance in traditional cash; but now, each BTC is worth over $400 -- having reached a peak point of over $1000 per BTC several years ago.\n\nIt was once possible to set your PC the task of mining for Bitcoins using algorithms, or joining mining pools with other users to share the computational expense of mining in return for a share of the profits.\n\nNowadays, for the average PC user, the trade-off between the expense of running PCs systems capable of mining for Bitcoin is no longer worth the reward.\n\nHowever, a research team from Illinois, led by Rakesh Kumar, has released a study (.PDF) documenting how a new machine dubbed ""Approximate"" could lessen the time and power required to find elusive Bitcoins.\n\nWithin the paper, Kumar and his team say that computers set to the task of Bitcoin mining try to generate hashes with certain values. As noted in an interview with CCN, Bitcoin mining starts by looking at a nonce -- a value that results in a double SHA-256 hash -- before looking for a value below this target.\n\nMining seeks hashes which correspond to a large number of nonces, with either a straight success or failure; a system Kumar calls an ""embarrassingly parallel application.""\n\nMining hardware contains sets of mining units, each of which generates a hash, and if an error occurs, this error impacts only one unit -- which also prevents the spread of errors to other units.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin mining often comes with the risk of two major faults: false positives and false negative results. Recording and sorting these errors can push up the time and system power required in mining operations.\n\nThis is where ""Approximate"" hardware comes in. Not only could this type of hardware measure errors and accept false positives and negatives with less power consumption, but it could also generate twice as many hashes per second than traditional PCs. In turn, miners could earn more virtual currency while spending less on computational power.\n\nIn total, the team found that using the faster and smaller Approximate hardware creates the opportunity to raise Bitcoin mining profits by up to 30 percent.\n\nKumar told the publication:\n\n""When compared to original non-approximate hardware, a smaller and faster approximate system allows the miner to pack more mining units into the same or smaller chip area. Increased speed, and more hashes per second, increases how many bitcoins can be mined per unit-time.""\n\nThe team told the publication that the goal isn\'t to build vast arrays of specialist systems for mining cryptocurrency, but to help developers consider new ways and methods for mining in the future.\n\nIn related news, a recent study has suggested that roughly $103,000 in virtual currency has been siphoned out of Bitcoin wallets over the past six years due to alternative security measures which used easy-to-remember passwords rather than cryptographic keys.', 'More and more high profile financial and political institutions are taking notice of the blockchain technology of distributed ledgers, starting internal investigations and issuing position papers.\n\nIn January, Bitcoin Magazine reported that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released a paper titled “Virtual Currencies and Beyond: Initial Considerations” at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Similar papers have been issued by other mainstream institutions.\n\nThe RAND Corporation, an influential global policy think tank with strong U.S. defense and homeland security ties, released a report titled “National Security Implications of Virtual Currency.” A recent report issued by the U.K. Government Office for Science, titled “Distributed ledger technology: beyond block chain,” explores how distributed ledger technology can revolutionize public policies and advocates the use of blockchains for a variety of public services.\n\nA recent working paper released by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD), titled “How Can Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology Play a Role in Building Social and Solidarity Finance?,” explores the potential of distributed ledgers to help create a global world order fairer and more sustainable than the current one, and wonders how blockchain technology can be harnessed for community empowerment and solidarity-based finance.\n\nThe UNRISD is an autonomous research institute within the U.N. system that undertakes multidisciplinary research and policy analysis on the social dimensions of contemporary development issues. The author of the UNRISD paper, Brett Scott, is an independent researcher and consultant on alternative finance and financial reform. Scott is the author of The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance: Hacking the Future of Money.\n\nAccording to Scott, it’s important to test the potential of Bitcoin and blockchain technology for building truly empowering social and solidarity-based finance.\n\n“This paper provides a primer on the basics of Bitcoin and discusses the existent narratives about the technology’s potential to facilitate remittances, financial inclusion, cooperative structures and even micro-insurance systems,” says Scott. “It also flags up potential points of concern and conflict, such as the tech-from-above ‘solutionism’ and conservative libertarian political dynamics of some of the technology start-up community that surrounds Bitcoin. As a way of contrast the paper considers ‘blockchain 2.0’ technologies with more overtly communitarian ideals and their potential for creating ‘cooperation at scale.’”\n\nScott suggests research on how blockchain technology could be implemented with sensitivity to the real struggles people face in implementing technology within diverse cultural and political contexts.\n\n“One blockchain does not fit all,” notes Scott.\n\nIn particular, he suggests a research effort, presumably conducted under the leadership of the UNRISD, on the extent to which developing countries are actually adopting blockchain technology, the extent to which cryptocurrencies could interact with “blockchain 2.0” smart-contract technology to create alternative financial schemes, and the Bitcoin system’s potential to promote financial inclusion, including its use as a remittance system and as an alternative bank account.\n\nFor example, blockchain-based property title systems (such as land registries) could open up normal bank financing to people who otherwise cannot get access to credit from financial institutions.\n\nThe popular technology magazine Motherboard notes that “most Bitcoin startups are just too damn libertarian to take up the altruistic challenge of helping less privileged people,” according to Scott. “But there is some hope that Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology… might actually help developing economies.”\n\nScott describes the “techno-libertarian” message as “a technology-as-saviour and markets-as-saviour gospel alongside an anti-state message,” and outlines the disruptive potential of smart contracts and Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAOs).\n\nIt is, however, possible to build a communitarian anarchist reading of the same technology. Scott suggests de-emphasizing the focus on the trustless nature of blockchains, and instead characterize blockchain technology as trust-enabling.\n\nScott mentions Bitnation, a blockchain-based “Governance 2.0” initiative with a collaborative platform for DIY governance, as one of the most radical articulations of the techno-libertarian message, and quotes two Bitcoin Magazine articles (1, 2) about Bitnation.\n\nLed by Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, Bitnation launched several pathfinders and proofs of concept including the first marriage registered on the blockchain and the first blockchain passport. The organization also developed and tested, as suggested by Scott in the U.N. paper, workable DIY land titles recorded on the blockchain in Ghana, where 70 percent of land lacks proper title, preventing investment and borrowing in real property markets.\n\n“Bitnation has presented a vision -- at least in principle -- of hosting completely alternative state institutions (such as security and legal institutions) on blockchain systems, describing states as governance service providers that might be outcompeted by technological platforms,” says Scott.\n\nAt the same time, persuaded that that modern democratic states can represent the interests of all, Scott prefers a mixed, socially oriented “libertarian socialist” approach to the pure “stateless” libertarian model promoted by Bitnation.\n\nPhoto Tom Page / Flickr(CC)', 'New York-based bitcoin exchange itBit has hired a securities services and technology veteran to head operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe hire of Jason Nabi comes as the exchange opens a new office in London.

In fact, banks there were more likely to be issuing warnings about digital currencies than getting involved in any related activity.\n\nIt was the fall of Mt Gox in Japan and the Chinese central bank\'s crackdown on bitcoin exchanges, events that both took place in 2014, that resulted in early barriers among financial institutions in those nations.\n\nHowever, the recent upsurge in the popularity of blockchain technology in the global finance sector seems to have at least somewhat laid those concerns to rest. Now, the region\'s banking sector is showing the same growing enthusiasm for the tech\'s disruptive potential in banking that can be seen in Europe and North America.\n\nEvidence of this sea change can be seen in the number of large financial institutions in China, Japan and Korea that have recently moved to launch or support initiatives involving blockchain and digital currency, and develop proofs of concept around forward-looking applications of the technology.\n\nIn this article, we look at which banks are engaging with the technology in the region.\n\nJapan\'s largest bank develops its own cryptocurrency\n\nAt the start of this month, Japan\'s Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG) revealed that it has developed its own digital currency nicknamed ""MUFG coin"" as part of its research into blockchain and distributed ledger technology.\n\nThe initiative was set up to replicate the peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange and mobile-wallet functionality that bitcoin provides, but without relying on its distributed network of miners.\n\nMUFG began the project in the autumn of 2015, with the aim of decreasing the costs of managing financial transactions, particularly in the case of P2P transfers and remittances.\n\nThe country\'s largest bank, MUFG ranked eighth among the world\'s largest banks in total assets by Relbanks.com.\n\nMajor Korean bank kicks off blockchain remittance project\n\nSouth Korea\'s KB Kookmin Bank announced just this week that it is developing a blockchain solution for international remittances with the aim of offering ""safer and faster"" money transmission services.\n\nThe initiative, which is being carried out in partnership with local bitcoin startup Coinplug, is built on the premise of eliminating intermediary services involved in international SWIFT bank transfers, with an eye to offer cheaper consumer-facing services as a result.\n\nA bank spokesperson remarked at the time:\n\n""Blockchain technology is a new trend and we are trying to adopt this technology in a low level of data integrity platform. We are planning to escalate our services further to provide more secure and comfortable financial services for our customers.""\n\nKookmin has also announced plans to develop a blockchain-based ""overseas fund transfer and data storage service"" that can be used for verification when opening online bank accounts.\n\nKB Kookmin Bank is the largest subsidiary of KP Financial group, which according to its 2014 annual report earned KRW 1.4tn ($1.16bn) in revenue from more than 30 million customers.\n\nSingapore bank gets in on the blockchain action\n\nAs 2015 drew to a close, news emerged of a blockchain partnership between Singapore\'s DBS Bank and multinational banking firm Standard Chartered.\n\nWith the aim of creating a distributed ledger project for trade finance, officials at both firms told Bloomberg that they have completed initial testing for the idea, and that they are seeking to collaborate with other firms on the initiative over the course of 2016.\n\nWhile details are sketchy, DBS and Standard Chartered are considering various distributed ledger technologies to achieve project goals.\n\nFurthermore, both banks have reportedly been investigating applications for the technology since as early as May of this year, according to a blog post by R3CEV co-founder Todd McDonald.\n\nDBS Bank is Southeast Asia\'s largest bank, reporting $319b in total assets as of September 2015.\n\nJapanese firms team up for blockchain banking project\n\nIn December, Japan\'s SBI Sumishin Net Bank announced that it is developing a proof-of-concept aimed at exploring blockchain-based banking services in conjunction with Nomura Research Institute (NRI), the research arm of Nomura Holdings.\n\nWhile details on the initiative are scarce, NRI said it will seek to ""examine business scenarios"" with the goal of preparing a prototype for SBI Sumishin.\n\nHowever, it is known that Dragonfly Fintech Pte, a blockchain firm, will assist in the project\'s development.\n\nIn statements, NRI senior management director Minoru Yokote cited the project as an example of how the organization is seeking to embrace distributed financial technologies.\n\nYokote said:\n\n""NRI is committed to examining technical challenges of blockchain and suggesting ways to apply this technology to the banking industry.""\n\nSBI Investment also announced on 29th January that it has agreed to invest $5m in Payward, the parent company of the Kraken bitcoin exchange.\n\nOn the same day, SBI announced a second agreement to invest an undisclosed amount in distributed ledger tech startup Ripple and to establish a joint venture company with the firm that will operate in Asia.\n\nAn investment in Japanese exchange bitFlyer may also be on the cards according to the groups Q3 financial results for the last financial year.\n\nSBI Sumishin is a recent joint venture between Japan’s largest trust bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, and SBI Holdings.\n\nFounded in 1965, NRI is Japan\'s oldest private think tank, offering consulting services and provides IT solutions for various industries, including finance.\n\nChina\'s central bank considers issuing digital currency\n\nLast month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the country\'s central bank, suggested it is considering the launch of its own digital currency, which may or may not use blockchain technology.\n\nThe PBoC revealed in a 20th January release that it had held a meeting discussing the possibility, which had included central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan and deputy governor Fan Yifei, as well as a group of ""relevant research institutions, major financial institutions and advisory bodies of experts"".\n\nThe central bank also received input from Citibank and Deloitte, as it weighed up how to issue the digital currency.\n\nNotably, the central bank put together a team dedicated to digital currency research in 2014 – the work of which played into the Beijing meeting.\n\nJapanese bank jons R3 blockchain consortium\n\nLate last year, the R3CEV consortium announced that yet more institutions had joined its roster of 25 banks (now over 40) that were working with the group to investigate and develop use cases for distributed ledger technology.\n\nOne of those institutions was Japan\'s Mizuho Bank, which notably has a long track record of engaging with the bitcoin industry, having served as a banking partner for bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt Gox. Indeed, Mizuho is currently embroiled in ongoing lawsuits related to that ill-fated partnership.\n\nMizuho joined R3 in October, indication in statements that the bank saw the potential for ""improved banking service in every aspect"".\n\n""Distributed ledger technologies might become the next disruptive technology that has the potential to innovate everyday banking activities,"" Toshitsugu Okabe, deputy president & executive officer for the bank\'s Incubation Project Team, said at the time\n\nSouth Korean bank invests in blockchain firm\n\nBlockchain remittance startup Streami closed a $2m seed funding round last December that notably included among its backers Shinhan Bank, one of South Korea\'s largest financial services providers.

02/17/2016,"['IBM has high hopes for blockchain technology. The IT giant announced on Tuesday a laundry list of plans to use blockchain tech and to help developers do the same. IBM (IBM) will offer tools through its cloud service for building blockchain apps, and it will open up IBM ""Garages"" in London, New York, Singapore and Tokyo for experts to collaborate with developers on blockchain tech.\n\nTaken in tandem with the recent flurry of banks and financial institutions expressing public interest in blockchain, the technology is having a moment. In September, a slew of banks including BBVA, Citi, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, and UBS all joined a coalition, led by a firm called R3, to implement blockchain technology in banking. In December, five more big names hopped on board, including BNP Paribas, ING, and Wells Fargo.\n\nBut the great irony of the banks\' interest in blockchain is that the idea of a blockchain for traditional banking defeats the purpose of the blockchain—at least as it has been used thus far, with the digital currency bitcoin. And top executives from some of the very same institutions that have signed on to R3 have separately disparaged bitcoin.\n\nTo understand what it is that banks claim to want to do with blockchain, you first need to understand the bitcoin blockchain, which is a public, decentralized ledger that records every single bitcoin transaction. Think of it like a library card in the cloud (not the card you use to take out a book, but the slip inside a book that lists all the borrowers). If you send a friend $5 worth of bitcoin, the transaction goes on the blockchain. If one bitcoin startup acquires another bitcoin startup for $500,000 in bitcoin, that, too, goes on the blockchain. And you can view the blockchain in real time, as transactions are uploaded, at blockchain.info. Transactions are added in bundles, called ""blocks,"" by ""miners,"" who receive a tiny fee in bitcoin as an incentive to mine. Miners use large, expensive computers to find and mine the blocks.\n\nThe excitement of the bitcoin blockchain, to people in the digital currency world, is the potential for decentralized applications to be built on top of it that cut out the middle man. And the blockchain can be used to store and send anything of value, so there are companies using it to store documents like property deeds and even marriage licenses.\n\nAnd now: Enter the banks. They\'ve long stayed away from bitcoin, which has a toxic public image thanks to headlines about bitcoin being used in embezzlement and Ponzi schemes. (Think of Mt. Gox and Silk Road.) MasterCard CEO Ajay Banga said he believes bitcoin ""starts bumping up against societal rules, which I worry about,"" and that, ""it doesn’t give me the safety and security of knowing that I am who I am, and I’m paying who I know, which is what traditional currency does."" And yet, MasterCard (MA) invested in Digital Currency Group, a venture firm that has itself invested in 65 different bitcoin and blockchain-enabled businesses. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said bitcoin ""is going nowhere... There is nothing behind a bitcoin, and I think if it was big, the governments would stop it."" And yet, JPMorgan (JPM) has signed on with R3.\n\nForget bitcoin, embrace blockchain\n\n\n\nBitcoin is doomed, if you ask Dimon. But the blockchain—now that\'s exciting. As Dimon said on CNBC last month, ""The blockchain is a technology, which we’ve been studying... and yes, it’s real. If it proves to be cheap and secure it will be adopted for a whole bunch of stuff.""\n\n\n\n\n\nTranslation: Blockchain is hot, bitcoin is not. We are seeing this sentiment again and again. IBM, in its extensive press release this week about its blockchain efforts, does not use the word ""bitcoin"" once. Bitreserve, a cloud banking vault launched by CNET founder Halsey Minor and led by former Barclays CIO Anthony Watson, was so eager to shed the stink of bitcoin that it changed its name to Uphold. Blockchain ""is so hot right now,"" writes Erik Voorhees, the CEO of bitcoin startup Shapeshift, while bitcoin ""has been left by the wayside, ignored like an embarrassing relative at a family gathering.” (And yet the price of bitcoin is up 24% in the last six months, 85% in the last six.)\n\nWhat will using blockchain tech even look like for banks? R3\'s web site says its mission is ""building and empowering the next generation of global financial services technology."" That\'s pretty vague. David Rutter, CEO of R3 and a former executive at London-based electronic brokerage ICAP, has said R3 will help banks and financial firms use the ""fabric"" of blockchain technology.\n\nStory Continues', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Digital Asset Holdings LLC, a start-up specializing in the blockchain technology for the financial services industry, announced on Wednesday that it has entered into business relationships with Accenture, Broadridge and PricewaterhouseCoopers to ensure faster adoption of its product.\n\n""These alliances will accelerate innovation, drive growth and broaden our reach in different segments across the world,"" said Blythe Masters, chief executive officer at Digital Asset holdings and a former JP Morgan investment banker.\n\nThe blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin, is a digital tool for recording and verifying transactions. The technology makes it easier to create cost-efficient business networks without requiring central control.\n\nThe partnerships show how the financial services industry is exploring the potential of the blockchain. In 2015, there was an explosion of interest in the bitcoin technology as a way to solve inefficiencies in financial markets.\n\nThe blockchain is also referred to as a distributed ledger. Digital Asset Holdings, in its statement, referred to itself as a provider of distributed ledger technology.\n\nTechnology services provider Accenture will provide consulting and systems integration services - ranging from feasibility studies, business case assessments to operating model design - for clients through collaboration on blockchain-related work at global financial institutions, the statement said.\n\nBroadridge will help identify, develop and drive adoption of business use cases of the blockchain, while PwC will help educate Digital Asset\'s clients on its technology.\n\n""We believe that our partnership with Digital Asset and blockchain solutions demonstrates PwC\'s commitment to providing our global clients with what the markets are demanding,"" said Haskell S. Garfinkel, partner, FinTech co-leader at PwC.\n\n""That is, commercially viable open sourced technologies that are based on trust, and solve the most complex problems businesses face at speeds and costs not yet imagined.""\n\nTwo weeks ago, Goldman Sachs and IBM participated in Digital Asset\'s latest funding round. Digital Assets raised roughly $60 million.\n\n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Bill Trott)\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Global bitcoin exchange Kraken said on Wednesday significant progress has been made in the investigation into claims of creditors of bankrupt exchange MtGox.\n\nIn 2014, MtGox Co Ltd, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, was forced to file for bankruptcy after hackers stole an estimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins.\n\nKraken was appointed in November of that year to assist Tokyo district court-appointed trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi in the bankruptcy investigation of missing bitcoins, receiving claims and distributing remaining assets to creditors of MtGox.\n\nKraken said in a statement, citing the Tokyo-based trustee, that out of the 9,863 persons who filed bitcoin-only claims through the Japanese trustee or through Kraken’s online service, 7,952 claimants have been approved. The approved creditor claims are equivalent to around 12.6 billion yen in bitcoins, with about 27.5 billion yen in bitcoins still on hold.\n\nAccording to the trustee’s report shared by Kraken, a total of 24,733 people around the world have filed bankruptcy claims related to the MtGox exchange.\n\nThe total amount of bankruptcy claims filed in both bitcoin and fiat currencies are about 2.7 trillion yen. The trustee currently holds 202,163.41191816 bitcoin, worth more than $84 million.\n\n“Although the investigation into MtGox claims is still ongoing, we have made significant progress for creditors,” said Kobayashi.\n\nOne bitcoin is currently worth around $418.88 on the BitStamp platform. (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Bernard Orr)', 'An innovation center established by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and emir of Dubai, has announced the formation of a research council focused on blockchain technology.\n\nLaunched in 2015, the Museum of the Future was created with the mandate to encourage innovation and help foster investigation of new technologies within the Middle Eastern nation. The keystone of the project will be an architectural centre (estimated to cost $136m) and set to be completed in 2017.\n\nAccording to the release, the Global Blockchain Council will consist of 32 members including government entities (Smart Dubai Office, Dubai Smart Government, the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), international companies (Cisco, IBM, SAP, Microsoft) and blockchain startups (BitOasis, Kraken and YellowPay).\n\nIn the past, Museum of the Future has voiced support for emerging technologies such as drones, as well as the broader applicability of new technologies to education, healthcare and travel. Further, the announcement follows Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s declaration that 2015 would serve as a ""year of innovation"" for the Middle Eastern nation.\n\nAccording to a press release from the government of Dubai’s media office, the Global Blockchain Council will explore and discuss potential applications of blockchain technology, with the goal of highlighting how it could come to impact domestic financial and non-financial business sectors.\n\nIn statements, Saif Al Aleeli, CEO of Dubai Museum of the Future Foundation, explained the importance of the initiative, given statistics he cited that suggest global blockchain investments could reach $300bn over the next four years.\n\nAl Aleeli said:\n\n""The Global Blockchain Council will launch different initiatives under its umbrella to highlight and promote blockchain and digital currencies, and explore its advantages and disadvantages. It will also draw a roadmap for best uses of this emerging technology.""\n\nHe further stated that the group’s efforts will include the creation of an annual conference that will host “high-profile individuals, workshops, awareness sessions [and] hackathons"".\n\nDr. Aisha Bin Bishr, director general of Smart Dubai Office, an initiative overseeing Dubai\'s interests in smart cities, added that the Global Blockchain Council will seek to unite both public and private industry stakeholders for the efforts.\n\n""New technologies such as blockchain open significant opportunities for all service providers to reshape transactions, making experiences more seamless and secure for all customers,"" Bin Bishr said in the release.\n\nAdditional statements were given by the CEO of the Dubai International Financial Centre Authority (DIFCA), an agency that reports to the UAE’s president on “economic development and planning, registry of companies and administration of companies law and data protection law,” according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF); and the operator of Nasdaq Dubai, formerly the Dubai International Financial Exchange.\n\nFirst pilot project\n\nAs part of the announcement, the Museum of the Future detailed pilot projects it will embark on for the initiative.\n\nThe first pilot project, according to the release, will find Dubai-based bitcoin services startup BitOasis working with the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), which was created in 2002 to establish a commodities marketplace in Dubai.\n\nBitOasis will work with the DMCC to ""secure flexidesk contracts and registration process using the blockchain ledger"" as a means to help the organization ""stay ahead of the curve"" while providing guidance on the technology to other market participants, according to Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Executive Chairman of Dubai Multi Commodities Centre Authority.\n\nA second project will find the DMCC working with bitcoin exchange Kraken to ""help DMCC catalyze"" blockchain technology in select Islamic finance operations.\n\n""It is therefore a natural next step for DMCC to play our part in not only piloting the BitOasis and Kraken Bitcoin Exchange projects, but to do everything we can to bring more projects like these to market in the future in collaboration with the Dubai Blockchain Council,"" Bin Sulayem said.\n\nPoints of confusion\n\nDespite the strong signal of interest from the UAE, there were signs in its release that suggest its views on the technology remain in early stages.\n\nFor example, language included suggested that ""Blockchain supports more than two million bitcoin wallets"", inferred that there may be confusion at the institution between the bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain, and bitcoin’s underlying distributed ledger, referred to as the blockchain.\n\n""Blockchain is available worldwide in more than 15 languages, and allows the user to send bitcoin by emails and text message, while still maintaining the user’s privacy and security,"" the release read. Notably, Blockchain was not one of the members mentioned as part of the initial Global Blockchain Council.\n\nElsewhere, the language similarly blurred the lines between bitcoin, the digital currency, and blockchain, a term often used to denote its distributed ledger applications.\n\n""The blockchain market reports that the average volume of bitcoin transactions in 24 hours is $105.6m, and the bitcoin market cap is averaged at $6.8bn,"" the release said.\n\nNonetheless, the ambitious program marks a milestone for the technology in a region where there have been few major industry announcements.\n\nImage via Museum of the Future\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.\n\nForbes has argued the currency has not been that anonymous, as each transaction has been documented on the blockchain. But a spokesperson for the E.C. said the public ledgers were not transparent enough.\n\n“Indeed, public ledgers offer traceability to transactions between accounts,” press officer Letizia Lupini explained. “However, these accounts remain anonymous. This anonymity is potentially an incentive for unlawful activities.”\n\nRegulators and advocacy groups have said more education is needed, not regulation.\n\nJason Weinstein, director of the Blockchain Alliance, told Bitcoin Magazine that restrictions were not the solution.\n\n“Criminals and terrorists are using all sorts of technology to try to hide their activities over the Internet, but those who turn to Bitcoin as part of that effort are making a big mistake,” he said.\n\nDavid Long, principal and senior consultant at the Northern California Fraud Prevention Solutions, said it would be easier to launder euros than bitcoins, “Though from an initial investigative standpoint, bitcoins might present more of a challenge due to the necessity of uncovering who is actually responsible for a given transaction or transactions.\n\n“However, once the actor\'s identity is uncovered, the blockchain makes it possible to uncover most, if not all, of a person\'s transactions,” Long said. “This capability is without parallel when the subject is dealing in euros or dollars.”\n\nBitcoin was called the “single, common currency for cybercriminals within the E.U.,” in a 2015 report by Europol. Combined with the claim by Reuters that bitcoin has been the most popular virtual currency, claiming 80 percent of the European market, and in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks, the E.U. has been compelled to act.\n\n“With today\'s Action Plan we are moving swiftly to clamp down on terrorist financing, starting with legislative proposals in the coming months,” Dombrovskis said in a press release. “We want to improve the oversight of the many financial means used by terrorists, from cash and cultural artifacts to virtual currencies and anonymous pre-paid cards, while avoiding unnecessary obstacles to the functioning of payments and financial markets for ordinary, law-abiding citizens.""\n\nYet questions have been raised about whether the regulations will accomplish what the E.C. wants.\n\n“Those looking to remain hidden when they buy and sell bitcoins are likely already avoiding online exchanges. Most exchanges today are already following KYC/AML procedures,” virtual currency expert Michael Yeung said.\n\nThere has also been concern about what tougher regulations could mean for small businesses working in Bitcoin.\n\n“Regulation is desirable and required, but regulation that is too onerous may end up destroying legitimate businesses in their infancy,” blockchain researcher and consultant at CryptolQ, Albert Szmigielski said.\n\nWeinstein, director of the Blockchain Alliance, has warned in a Forbes article that complex regulation may pave the way for a black market takeover.\n\n“Regulators should appreciate the fact that most of the Bitcoin companies are startups and do not have a lot of resources,” he said. “The simpler the landscape of compliance rules, the better it is for not only the companies but also the public for whom the regulations are there to protect.”\n\nThe new rules will be announced by the end of June. Countries will have until 2017 to put them into effect.\n\nPhoto Thijs ter Haar / Flickr(CC)', ""This is the second article in a two part series on the different types of Blockchain startups. Part one discussed public blockchains. Part two discusses private blockchains.\n\nBlockchain is the new buzzword for 2016. The largest, most secure public blockchain is the one used by Bitcoin, which has a current market value of about $6.4 billion. For many entrepreneurs out there, the alluring nature of the blockchain’s potential might be a new calling. Bitcoin enables many interesting innovations, such as making international wage payments faster and cheaper through my company, Bitwage, but there are equally intriguing things happening with what are known as private or permissioned blockchains.\n\nA blockchain, at its most basic level, is just a means of storing digital information in an immutable form. At the corporate IT strategy level, blockchain based systems are conceptually similar to relational databases, which disrupted the mainframe's dominance a generation ago, or NoSQL databases, which began disrupting the relational database's niche at the start of this decade.\n\nThe blocks in the blockchain are chained cryptographically, making it impossible to 'cook the books' by editing older content. New content is examined by all systems participating in maintaining a blockchain and when enough of them agree, this arrival at a consensus is memorialized by writing a new block.\n\nBitwage is running smoothly and as the company matured I got to spend time looking for what is happening next in the industry. There are many financial services companies interested in blockchain payments but there are just as many applications for the blockchain's immutable public register that do not require public access. Georges Nahon, CEO of Orange Silicon Valley, shared his thoughts on private blockchains.\n\n“Although permission is restricted with a private blockchain, they are still decentralized, without a singular authority. The blockchain is used to establish trust between partners and to remove or reduce the role of a clearing house. Companies can create different assets, specify transaction speed, impose privacy requirements and decide who may take part. Shared between members of a consortium, private enterprise blockchains can be used to build trust and efficiency between partners.\n\nCompanies would prefer to do without some of the baggage of Bitcoin; for example, the high energy costs of mining. Private blockchains can be tailored for the specific use cases of enterprises and their partners. By analogy, the public internet benefited from the development of the intranets, their private counterpart, and vice versa.”\n\nBuilding trust and efficiency through transparency seems to be the key for both public and private blockchains. The processes of sharing information between a network of partners or even a network of subsidiaries is incredibly inefficient, requiring intermediaries to ensure the legitimacy of data. Blockchain technology’s innovation rests in its ability to connect disparate organizations. The use cases being explored by enterprises involve reducing reconciliation processes, improving network security, and automating workflows.\n\nMany startups are seeing a great deal of success building out specific use cases with private blockchains."", 'This article is by Rebecca Campbell.\n\nThe creators of a new digital currency say that mathematical algorithms will ensure that its users keep their transactions counterparties and amounts encrypted.\n\nWhile digital currencies such as Bitcoin are known for their pseudonymity, it is often possible to trace transactions across the shared Bitcoin ledger blockchain. This allows individuals to determine exactly who is sending bitcoins and where they are sending them.\n\nIn a bid to provide a true anonymous service, the creators of the new digital currency Zcash say that identification of users will be virtually impossible to detect. Currently in its pre-release alpha testing stage, Zcash will rely on cryptographic algorithms, which are known as zero-knowledge proofs. This system presents users with the opportunity to prove they have the money without revealing their identities or the amounts they are intending to transact at any time, giving greater control to those who are concerned about their privacy when it comes to digital transactions.\n\nThe news came by way of Zcash, which said on its website:\n\n“Unlike bitcoin, Zcash transactions automatically hide the sender, recipient, and value of all transactions on the block chain. Only those with the correct view key can see the contents. Users have complete control and can opt to provide others with their view key at their discretion.”\n\nStart of Something New for Bitcoin\n\nIn 2014, Zcash creator, founder and CEO Zooko Wilcox initially proposed the theory in an academic paper. In that short time, the digital currency has come a long way with still plenty of work to be done before Zcash can mature into a complete open system.\n\nTo further cement the future of Zcash, Wilcox said in a forum post last week that the Zcash team hopes to have a live version of the digital currency available in July. In the meantime, those eager to learn more about the currency can play around with the alpha version on a “testnet” network with a version of the currency that has no value at present.\n\nViable Choice for the Future?\n\nWilcox went on to say in a recent blog post that the added privacy would make Zcash the ideal choice for financial institutions and consumers to use compared to other digital currencies:\n\n“Companies need privacy in order to conduct their business. This is true for all sorts of companies, in all sorts of businesses.”\n\nOther digital currencies have previously claimed to provide enhanced anonymity compared to Bitcoin. These currencies focus on the CryptoNote procedure, which supports ring signatures. It is these ring signatures, which are a type of digital signature, that makes it mathematically impossible to see which group of users performed a transaction. Another currency, Dash, claims to provide anonymity to users by combining unrelated transactions. This prevents observers from determining the sources and destinations of transactions.\n\nDespite these innovations, Bitcoin remains the most valuable digital currency by market cap and is also the most widely accepted digital currency.\n\nWilcox said that privacy helps to strengthen social ties and social institutions:', 'A new Australian political party has proposed the introduction of a token-based political system based on the concept of decentralised blockchain technology.\n\nCalled the Flux Party, the new entity has already attracted more than the 500 members it needs to potentially place senate candidates on ballots in all the country\'s states. However, the party\'s immediate goal is to try and elect six senators, according to Reuters.\n\nNotably, the Flux Party will be free of its own policies, instead opting for its senators to vote for or against legislation at the bidding of token holders.\n\nParty co-founder Max Kaye told the news source:\n\n""If they didn\'t have to be senators, if they could just be software or robots they would be, because their only purpose is to do what the people want them to do.""\n\nAt election time, the bitcoin-like tokens would be issued to Flux members – as well as single-issue campaigners that support the party. The tokens can then be used either use to vote, trade with others or give to trusted third parties to carry out proxy votes.\n\nThe results of the voting would be distributed proportionately – for example, with an 80% to 20% vote in favor of a bill, five Flux senators would vote for and one against.\n\nSuggesting that the current democratic system is too antiquated for the Internet era, Kaye told Reuters that, while ministers sometimes do not have expertise on all issues, they are trusted with making vital decisions on policies affecting environmental or monetary policy.\n\nThe Flux Party system would mean that large numbers of of voters could effectively grant their votes to experts such as scientists or economists on these issues.\n\nDescribing itself as a ""layer for the redistribution of political power"", Flux says on its website:\n\n""Our current system doesn\'t work well enough; politics gets in the way of policy. Flux is an incremental upgrade to democracy designed to redistribute political power, maximise participation, remove bad policy, and empower voters.""\n\nInitial critiques\n\nWhile Flux\'s proposed voting system is potentially workable, bitcoin expert Dr Adrian Lee from the University of Technology Sydney told Reuters the absence of a legal mechanism to ensure senators vote as directed could be problematic for the party.\n\nThe concept of blockchain-based voting systems is not a new one. Just days ago, stock market giant Nasdaq revealed it is developing an electronic shareholder voting system for the Estonian stock market based on blockchain technology.\n\nAnd, almost exactly a year ago, the Bitcoin Foundation allowed members to cast votes in an election round directly on the bitcoin blockchain, though this test was not without issues.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But now a group of techies is hoping to revive the dream of ditching paper money and legitimizing traditional banking services for the nascent sector.\n\nA slew of new digital services are popping up to offer Colorado businesses an escape from cash. One service called Tokken is the brainchild of a soon-to-be-retired banking regulator named Lamine Zarrad. Zarrad hopes that his experience inside the federal banking oversight system will make it easier for him to persuade banks that Tokken solves the puzzle of legal-pot states in an illegal-pot nation, the New York Times reports.\n\nZarrad’s software hopes to create the kind of hard-and-fast digital transactions record banks want before accepting pot business. Tokken will eventually tap into Bitcoin technology to generate that paper trail, according to the Times.\n\nThe industry won’t switch from dollars to the digital currency, but instead conduct microtransactions in the Bitcoin marketplace that correspond with cash transactions in real life. Bitcoin generates a permanent record for each transaction through something called the blockchain. When Tokken flips a sliver of a Bitcoin between two accounts it owns, it can use the blockchain to generate a record of a real-world pot transaction that might satisfy a brick-and-mortar bank’s concerns about taking pot deposits.\n\nBefore this tech push, people in Colorado tried to use more traditional means to liberate cannabusinesses from cash. The Fourth Corner Credit Union (TFCCU) thought it had figured out how to satisfy federal guidelines for cannabusiness banking by creating the most elaborate fraud monitoring and compliance system anywhere in the banking industry, as ThinkProgress previously reported, but the Federal Reserve and National Credit Union Administration denied the group’s application to start taking deposits and making electronic transactions.\n\nTFCCU is suing both agencies, but a judge bluntly dismissed its suit against the Fed in early January. The would-be bankers are appealing that decision, but the prospects for both cases are dim so long as marijuana is treated as an illegal narcotic under federal law.\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/David Zalubowski\n\nDespite the federal stonewalling for the credit union idea, people like Zarrad are still confident they can find a way around federal prohibition. Tokken and other apps hope to create an intermediary service that gives banks legal certainty, and marijuana businesses an escape from the security risks and financial strain of dealing in cash. The coders’ efforts are guided by the same DOJ and Treasury memos that TFCCU relied upon.\n\nTo even begin to take advantage of those federal efforts, both pot sellers and their banks have to be able to see every transaction clearly and in full. Cash dealings put cataracts on the industry’s eyes. Storefronts and growers can keep immaculate records, but banks know that both outright money laundering and self-interested accounting fraud are much easier with a cash business. No matter how much they might trust a client, cash deprives them of the ability to verify her books up to the higher standards of certainty that the DOJ and Treasury laid out for marijuana banking.\n\nThe tech-based workaround Zarrad’s company plans to offer will still face the same practical hurdles that TFCCU couldn’t clear. If the retiring regulator can’t persuade traditional banks that the Tokken system gives them a sufficient foothold to deal safely with an industry still illegal at the federal level, all the Bitcoin maneuvering in the world won’t give dispensaries and growers access to business loans and debit card transactions.\n\nAnd even if bankers decide Zarrad’s scheme fulfills the obligations that DOJ officials have sketched out for them, they may remain sidelined. Administration officials can write as many memos and strike as many regulatory compromises as they want, but they can’t erase the basic fact that any and all marijuana dealings remain criminal under federal law.\n\nThe blunt force of prohibition was on full display in U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson’s dismissal of TFCCU’s lawsuit against the Fed in January. While the credit union “attempts to give me comfort that, notwithstanding the oath I took to uphold the laws of the United States, I can grant the relief it seeks,” Jackson wrote, his hands are tied by the federal Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ and Treasury documents “simply suggest that prosecutors and bank regulators might ‘look the other way’ if financial institutions don’t mind violating the law,” Jackson wrote. “A federal court cannot look the other way.”', 'The Greek Bitcoin community gathered in Athens for a conference to discuss new opportunities that the virtual currency opens up, including helping deal with capital controls in the country.\n\nThe aim of the conference to present the advantages and challenges of bitcoin and the blockchain technologies. The gathering took place in INNOVATHENS which is known as the Technopolis City of Athens. The services have been provided by the National Documentation Centre, with the aim of internationalization of business and its better access to finance and innovation management.\n\nThe event was organized by WWTP / OSS for Open Source and the Greek community of Bitcoin, in cooperation with the National Documentation Centre, the Greek node of the Enterprise Europe Network, and the Hub of Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Technopolis City of Athens – INNOVATHENS .\n\nGeorge Papageorgiou has introduced Bitcoin and Blockchain to those who knew very little about it.

After spending more than a month trying to figure out every aspect of it, I decided that this is something really important for humanity and I should take active part in informing other people about Bitcoin, in our language, Greek. This is how BitcoinX.gr was created. Together with other passionate people we started posting detailed articles in Greek covering the inner workings of Bitcoin, its pros and cons and most importantly explaining why it is something important, why and how people should use it. Our legal representative has taken special care to address legal challenges that Bitcoin faces in our country and of course provide guidance and suggestions. Our work goes beyond the website itself, since we\'ve talked about Bitcoin in major national newspapers, TV stations, radio stations, TEDx events and documentaries. But what we\'re really proud of is the organization of the first ever events in Greece, one in Athens [2013] and one in Patras [2014], where we had the chance to meet people and have thorough discussions. Details about our actions can be found on our website.”\n\nMr. Lee Gibson Grant is the owner of coinstructors.com and is also interested in the Blockchain’s innovation. He has also demonstrated in real life how Bitcoin technology can have a positive impact in the hospitality industry, having launched a project on the Greek island of Agistri in July 2015. He is now preparing another project that would promote Greek islands as tourist destinations.\n\nMr. George Kimionis and Mr. Toni X. Smit, the creators of the blockgem platform, presented their project that enables any Bitcoin user to purchase any diamond using Bitcoin, without any third parties.\n\n- Toni X. Smit, Blockgem platform\n\nMr. Spiros Spiratos of Athera GI, a new innovative startup that hopes to determine optimal business locations based on both quantitative (e.g. customers locations) and qualitative (e.g. location attractiveness) criteria, also spoke to Cointelegraph. In response to the question of how he intends to explain the social media aspect of this project to potential customers, he said, “I will give an example. Many people, including myself, we visit specific bars and restaurants, just because we used to go there. When we discover that in a nearby area there are exceptional bars and restaurant we usually wonder: “Why have I never been there before?” The same applies to investors, who might falsely locate their business due to their bias in favor of the locations that they already know. In Athera by analyzing the customer activities using data from social media applications, we identify dynamic areas, in which an entrepreneur worth to locate his/her investment. To come back to your question, I would like to say that social media applications is a very efficient way for understanding what is going in a city, where and when. My profession is to give answers to the location problems of my clients by filtering and analyzing such data.”\n\nCointelegraph also reached out to Mr. Hugh Halford-Thompson, an organizer from Coinscrum, the London community, in order to have another point of view.\n\nHe was asked whether he thought these meetups helped to promote awareness of Bitcoin among a mainstream audience, whether he also made Bitcoin presentations in person, and how enterprises and merchants can become involved. He responded by saying, “We made them weekly so they were easy to find. They do raise awareness and they did raise awareness of Bitcoin but the interest now is generally around other uses of Blockchains - ethereum, smart contracts, POS chains, private chains... We have clients in many sectors and do presentations at events both public and private. See Blockchain Tech Ltd - we were at the BC Tech summit demoing our money transfer platform - several events at credit unions, large consultancies and banks...”\n\nLastly, Cointelegraph spoke to another Bitcoin community from Amsterdam, Bitcoin Wednesday Amsterdam. Mr. Richard Kohl, one of the organizers of the Amsterdam Bitcoin community said, “Yes, Bitcoin Wednesday brings people together around the theme of digital currency and its growing role in society, and not just locally. We draw visitors and speakers from around the world. On the first Wednesday of every month -- that\'s now 32 consecutive monthly events, we\'re in our 3rd year. During Bitcoin Wednesday the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation conducts its regular poll on what the public thinks and expects, so we aim to provide a visible monthly public platform for all sides of the ongoing debate.”\n\nIn conclusion, whenever there is a meetup, a lot of interested and interesting people take part. It is these people who could be the guides and informers for a mainstream audience, to allow them to explore the world of cryptocurrencies and the Blockchain. Cointelegraph and Bitcoin communities everywhere look forward to their next Bitcoin meetup.']"
02/18/2016,"['UPDATE (18th February 19:28 BST):This report has been updated with comment from Butterfly Labs.\n\nThe US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced that it has reached a settlement with bitcoin mining hardware maker Butterfly Labs after it sued the firm in 2014.\n\nAt the time, the FTC accused Butterfly Labs of deceptive business practices related to the development and sale of bitcoin mining equipment, as well as the receipt of customer funds for product preorders.\n\nThe agency said today that it has settled charges filed against Butterfly Labs and two of its officers: vice president of product development Sonny Vleisides, who has an ownership stake in the firm, and general manager Darla Drake.\n\nButterfly Labs, Vleisides and Drake agreed to pay partially suspended monetary penalties, according to final court orders published by the FTC.\n\nOf the $38,615,161 judgment ordered against Butterfly Labs and Vleisides, the defendants are required to pay $15,000 and $4,000, respectively, after which the remaining amount will be suspended. A judgment of $135,878 against Drake will be suspended following receipt of payment constituting “the cash value of all Bitcoins she obtained using company machines”.\n\nAccording to the FTC, these suspensions are due to an inability on the part of the defendants to pay. Butterfly Labs, Fleisides and Drake would be required to pay the full amounts in the event the terms of the agreement are broken.\n\nFurther, defendants are prohibited from making false representations about their bitcoin mining products in the future, and cannot take preorder payments from customers “unless those products are available and will be delivered within 30 days”.\n\n“Even in the fast-moving world of virtual currencies like Bitcoin, companies can’t deceive people about their products. These settlements will prevent the defendants from misleading consumers,” Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.\n\nThe settlement comes more than a year after the federal agency shuttered the company following an investigation into suspected fraud. That investigation was sparked by a wave of complaints submitted to the FTC by customers of the mining firm. Butterfly Labs later reopened following court approval.\n\nIn a statement, Butterfly Labs said that it continues to dispute the FTC\'s suit and is focusing its attention on processing customer refunds.\n\n“BFL continues to believe that the FTC case had no merit, but agreed to settle for $15,000 to avoid ongoing litigation expenses and conserve remaining assets for payment of refunds to consumers,"" the firm said.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In a separate incident, the Horry County school system in North Carolina was also struck by a ransomware cyberattack.\n\nThe cyberattack on Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center lasted nearly a fortnight after beginning on 5 Feb, with hospital systems affected and staff declaring an ‘internal emergency’. On Wednesday, the hospital announced that it had relented and paid the ransom demanded by extortionists. $17,000 in bitcoins.\n\nThe attack began on the evening of February 5th, when hospital staff started noticing issues in their attempts to access the hospital’s computer network. The Hospital’s in-house IT department were able to determine that a malware attack was putting the blockade on access to the hospital’s computer network.\n\nThe authorities – the Los Angeles Police Department and the FBI – were quickly notified. Computer forensics experts were quickly summoned to try and fix the malware, to no avail.\n\nVarious parts of the hospital, including essential systems supporting lab work, the pharmacy and CT scans among other departments were fundamentally inoperable. Electronic communications between doctors and the hospital staff came to a standstill. As a result, hospital staff had to rely on telephones and fax machines, while new patient registrations were logged on paper.\n\nSimilarly, a ransomware cyberattack struck the Horry County school system in North Carolina last week. The malware was discovered last Monday, according to local news outlet WNCN. Up to 25 servers are still currently encrypted after recovery efforts and administrators of the school system have sanctioned the payment of ransom up to $8,500. The extortionists have demanded the ransom to be paid in Bitcoins.\n\nRuing Ransomware\n\nThe malware deployed was a variant of ransomware which typically targets Windows machines. Ransomware has been around for more than a decade, annoying victims by locking down their keyboards and computer peripherals, even the entire computer. These days, malware authors are sophisticated in their means to infect machines by encrypting a targeted system’s files, using the ransomware malware.\n\nOnce encrypted, the decrypted key is promised to the targeted victim who is in a spot if a proper backup scheduling habit isn’t in place. The decrypted key, is eventually given to the victim, after a ransom is paid.\n\nRansomware is typically spread through phishing campaigns and malicious emails targeting computers in a network. Once triggered, the malware can spread rapidly to other computers on the same network.\n\nA recent report put together by prominent security firms including Symantec, Intel Security and Palo Alto Networks revealed the lucrative haul behind a successful ransomware campaign. The most prominent ransomware of them all – Cryptowall is said to have infected millions of computers around the world, extorting hundreds of thousands of victims along the way.\n\nLeading up to October in 2015, estimates peg extortionists raking in an estimated $325 million in bitcoin from victims around the world, in a ten month period.\n\nInteresting footnotes from the report include:\n\nBTC taken from victims was taken in by a large network of bitcoin wallets.\n\nInitial wallets were set up on the TOR network and advertised through ransom pay sites hosted on the network.\n\nThe ransom pay websites were activated when a victim was caught. Upon discovery by law enforcement, the wallet would be replaced by another wallet rotated in and embedded onto websites that direct victims to pay up.\n\nWhen a ransom demand turns up, the developers would transfer the funds out of the initial wallet to break it into a 70/30 split between several second, third, fourth and fifth layers of bitcoin wallets before eventually funneling the amount to the final wallet.\n\nBitcoin Ransom: Cheaper than Cybersecurity\n\nAs it turns out, paying the ransom in exchange for the decryption key is cheaper and quicker than costs incurred for a comprehensive restoration of an infected computer network, by cybersecurity professionals.\n\nIn a memo [PDF], President and CEO of the hospital, Allen Stefanek stated:\n\nThe quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key. In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.\n\nHe also disclosed the amount of ransom requested and paid was 40 bitcoins, equivalent to approx. $17,000.\n\nSimilarly, public information officer Teal Harding, representing Horry County Schools revealed:\n\nThe size of this system and the amount of overtime that’s having to be paid to the technicians working 20 hours a day way surpasses $8,500.\n\nAlthough the ransom payments will set a dangerous precedent with the next ransomware attack an inevitability, just like their payment method of choosing with Bitcoin, the FBI’s general advice to ransomware victims is to pay the ransom.\n\nJoseph Bonavolonta, assistant special agent at FBI’s CYBER and counterintelligence program explained:\n\nThe ransomware is that good. To be honest, we often advise people just to pay the ransom.\n\nWhatever happened to data backups?\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Accenture has launched a specialized practice within its financial services group to help institutions implement blockchain technology in order to improve operational efficiency, security and client service, as well as to capture new revenue opportunities.\n\nAccenture will provide a range of consulting and technology services, from feasibility studies, business case assessments and operating model design, to advisory services on systems architecture, cybersecurity and cloud consulting, through to full-scale systems integration.\n\nAccenture, a Fortune Global 500 company, is the world\'s largest consulting firm as measured by revenues. The company employs approximately 373,000 people serving clients in more than 120 countries. In December 2015, Accenture’s clients included 94 of the Fortune Global 100 and more than 80 percent of the Fortune Global 500. The prestige of Accenture and its leadership in the top corporate consulting space is likely to significantly boost blockchain-based fintech.\n\n“Blockchain and distributed-ledger technologies enable the financial industry to move away from reconciliation-based processes that are expensive and inefficient,” said David Treat, managing director and global head of Accenture’s capital markets blockchain practice. “Our new practice, which builds on the strong growth of our global capital markets business, can help clients move from concept to production in the shortest possible time, improving efficiency and unlocking new revenue streams.”\n\nThe Accenture press release notes that, according to the firm Aite Group, investment in new blockchain-enabled financial technologies will more than quintuple over the next four years, from an estimated $75 million in 2015 to $400 million by 2019. In June 2015 Santander InnoVentures, the $100 million fintech venture capital fund of Santander Group, Oliver Wyman and Anthemis Group, published a paper titled The Fintech 2.0 Paper: rebooting financial services. The paper noted that international payments remain slow and expensive, and significant savings can be made by banks and end-users bypassing existing international payment networks, and suggested that distributed ledger technology could reduce banks’ infrastructure costs attributable to cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by between $15 billion and $20 billion per annum by 2022.\n\nAccenture has also formed an alliance with Digital Asset Holdings to help institutions assess and implement block chain-related solutions. The two companies will collaborate on innovative solutions for banks, brokerages and infrastructure providers that Accenture will implement as a preferred systems integrator. A Digital Asset Holdings press release notes that, besides Accenture, the company is forming partnerships with Broadridge and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).\n\n“Accenture is a renowned leader in large-scale systems transformation and the development of complex technology infrastructure,” said Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset Holdings. “Working together, we can dramatically accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology globally. Our products and software combined with Accenture’s expertise at integrating new technologies with existing systems will help institutions reduce settlement latency, risk, operating costs and capital requirements.”\n\nAccenture and Digital Asset Holdings are key members of the Hyperledger Project, a high profile initiative spearheaded by the Linux Foundation, which wants to develop develop a new open source blockchain separated from the Bitcoin blockchain. “The development of blockchain technology has the potential to redefine the operations and economics of the financial services industry,” said Richard Lumb, chief executive of Accenture’s Financial Services.\n\nAccenture and Digital Asset Holdings support closed, “permissioned” blockchains that would offer the advantages of digital currencies – fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared distributed ledger – without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network where anyone can be a node on the network anonymously. Instead of anonymous miners, only banks and vetted financial operators would be allowed to validate transactions in permissioned blockchains.\n\n“To be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by Bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus,” said two Accenture executives in July. “With private chains, you can have a completely known universe of transaction processors,” Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters said in September. “That appeals to financial institutions that are wary of the bitcoin blockchain.”\n\nOther experts, including legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo, strongly argued that financial operators should, instead, embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Treat to find out more about Accenture’s position in the permissionless vs. permissioned blockchain debate.\n\n""Permissionless blockchain solutions were driven by the desire to transfer value – whether cryptocurrency or other digital assets – without the need for a trusted third-party,” Treat told Bitcoin Magazine. “That has tremendous power, but also distinct limits in terms of use cases and scalability. Permissioned blockchain solutions tip the dynamic towards groups of known actors who can message, transfer, and validate transactions in a number of ways with the necessary controls (e.g. AML/KYC). They are less constrained by latency and scalability challenges, which opens a multitude of opportunities for financial institutions to remove inefficiencies.""\n\n“Permissioned-based solutions enable faster and more scalable consensus mechanisms because the nodes are controlled by known chosen actors,” added Treat. “In a permissioned environment, the ledger can be engineered along a much wider array of consensus mechanisms, including multi-signature, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant, Proof of Stake, Zero Knowledge Proof, etc.”\n\nPhoto Michael Gray / Flickr', 'This profile is part of “The Fortune Entrepreneurs” list. See the full package here.\n\nBlythe Masters is no longer just one of the most powerful women on the Street; she’s one of the most powerful women on the Block—the Blockchain, that is. The former JPMorgan (jpm) exec who (for better or worse) helped pioneer the creation of credit default swaps in the ‘90s has returned to champion another innovation: the technology that powers Bitcoin. “If ever a topic needed demystifying, this probably is one of those,” she says.\n\nMasters’ venture, Digital Asset Holdings, is exploring how to apply Bitcoin’s underlying protocol to financial markets. “The technology,” she says, describing the cryptographic masterstroke in laymen’s terms, “is simply a newer, better, more sophisticated form of database technology.”\n\nThink of it as being a distributed ledger. The blockchain is “nothing more than an enhancement” on present record-keeping systems, Masters says, estimating that the technology could eliminate billions of dollars worth of redundancy, latency, and error costs in the post-trade processing of assets like bonds and equities. Regulators will like, she adds, that blockchain-based transactions can achieve greater transparency and traceability—an “immutable audit trail,” as Masters’ puts it in her distinctly English accent.\n\nAt the core of these potential savings lays a shared infrastructure. At present each financial institution maintains its own separate trading logs—a massive duplication of time and effort, and an expensive headache whenever any inconsistency arises. As a result, transactions today take as long as three days to settle. Compare that to the possibility of minutes on a common backend system.\n\nDigital Asset’s aspirations have attracted no shortage of attention in the banking world. The company has raised $60 million from 15 of the world’s biggest financial and technology firms—including JPMorgan, Citibank (c), Goldman Sachs (gs), and IBM (ibm)—and has already begun building a revamped settlement system for the Australian stock exchange. The firm has also initiated a trial program at the workplace of Masters’ former employer, JPMorgan, where she spent a 27-year-career, eventually heading global commodities until the bank sold the division and she left in 2014.\n\nDespite cheerleading on behalf of the blockchain, Masters, who rides horses in her spare time, has no sentimentality about Bitcoin itself. Whether any particular digital money gains broad acceptance is “largely irrelevant” to the company’s plans, she says. Bitcoin happens to be one use-case for the technology, but the blockchain is a separate thing altogether. “It is actually a distinct invention with its own benefits,” she says. Her views are, in fact, consistent with those of JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who put the smack down on the cryptocurrency at Fortune’s Global Forum last year: “Not going to happen,” he said.\n\nMore on Bitcoin: “Up all night with Bitcoin hackers“\n\nThat’s a line that will no doubt provoke the ire of innumerable libertarian-leaning Bitcoin loyalists. While most adherents to the blockchain believe its author—the mysterious presumed inventor (or group of inventors) named Satoshi Nakamoto—concocted it to circumvent governments, enterprising entrepreneurs and investors have lately been attempting to adapt the technology to suit to the financial sector’s needs. “You have to abide by the regulations that the regulators insist on,” Masters says. “This is not a philosophical divide, it’s a fact of life.”\n\nMasters, for one, is not trying to bring down the system; she’s trying to improve it. Digital Asset is one of about a dozen blockchain-brandishing firms seeking to overhaul the slow and laborious way the financial world transacts. Others include Chain, a San Francisco-based startup that has partnered with Nasdaq, and R3, a software developer that counts 40 banks as partners. In the face of competition, Masters remains undaunted.\n\n“Our firm exists to build what will be the common fabric or infrastructure,” she says.', 'In an effort to promote itself as the world’s most Bitcoin-friendly city, Arnhem in Netherlands has added Burger King to the list of businesses both big and small that accept Bitcoin payments within city limits.\n\nCurrently listing over 100 businesses that accept Bitcoin, Arnhem is hosting its next meetup at the Bitcoin-friendly Burger King on September 19th to celebrate the milestone of hitting 100 venues having signed up.\n\nThe team at Arnhem Bitcoin City consists of Bitcoin enthusiasts Patrick van der Meijde, Annet de Boer and Rogier Eijkelhof, three professionals that specialize in educating business owners on how commerce with cryptocurrency works.\n\nWhile Meijde, Boer and Eikelhof are pushing hard for businesses to adopt the cryptocurrency as an accepted form of payment, there’s also a considerable amount of work they must do to help promote consumer adoption of the cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin City’s Bitcoin Meetup seems to be a vibrant social group focused on educating the public at large in a fun and energetic atmosphere. Special offers and discounts have also obviously helped push adoption as several businesses have agreed to offer customers special perks for using the cryptocurrency such as free sides to meals ordered, discounts on event passes and BoGo Whopper deals specifically at Burger King (bacon and cheese not included).\n\nAs of May 28th when Bitcoin City started, the growth to 100 total businesses has been rapid.

The Trustee for the debtor sued to “clawback” the transfer into the bankruptcy estate (either as an avoidable preference or fraudulent transfer), based on claims that the transfer was fraudulent or unauthorized.\n\nUsing 11 U.S.C. §550(a), the bankruptcy trustee seek to may recover the transfers for the benefit of the creditors of the bankruptcy estate.\n\nThe Trustee and Lowe, the recipient of the transfer, are arguing over the classification of the bitcoin because, if the bitcoins are a commodity, then the Trustee is entitled to the return of 3,000 BTC or the current value of $1.3m; if the bitcoins are US currency then the Trustee is only entitled to the return of $363,861.43.\n\nArguments heard\n\nThe Trustee has argued that bitcoin should be treated as a commodity based on guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treating bitcoin as property, and based on rulings from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which also treat bitcoin as a commodity, claiming that the Bankruptcy Court should order the return of the transferred bitcoins themselves or their current value (which has appreciated since the transfer to Lowe.)\n\nLowe argues that the transfer at issue was always discussed in terms of fiat currency, and that the Trustee should only be able to recover the value of the bitcoins at the time of the transfer.\n\nLowe’s position is based on interpretations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), he contends, as well as multiple case opinions whereby judges determined that bitcoin is a form of currency. He further claims that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) considers bitcoin to be form of currency, and that the Bankruptcy Court should view bitcoin as a currency and limit the Trustee’s recovery to the value at the time of transfer.\n\nLowe claims that the Trustee is unfairly seeking to recover a windfall because the fiat value of bitcoins transferred has risen since the transfer to Lowe, and that if bitcoin’s value had fallen, the Trustee would take a contrary position.\n\nThe relevant bankruptcy statute, 11 USC §550(a), states:\n\n“…the trustee may recover, for the benefit of the estate, the property transferred, or, if the court so orders, the value of such property.”\n\nDefining value\n\nAlthough the purpose of section 550 is to recover from the correct party and to restore the estate to the financial condition that would have existed had the transfer never occurred, § 550(a) does not define “value,” nor indicate at what time “value” is to be determined.\n\nA bankruptcy court has discretion on how to value the property so as to put the estate in its pre-transfer position, and is empowered to award the greater of the sums to the trustee (Sanders v Hang (In re: Hang), 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 2836 (Bankr. E.D. Cal. Aug 16, 2007).\n\nCases in which the value of transferred property appreciated after the transfer are uncommon. In those rare circumstances, courts will make determinations based upon the circumstances of each individual case.\n\nIn those rare cases, courts ordered the return of the appreciated asset because the focus “is not on what the transferee gained by the transaction but rather on what the bankruptcy estate lost as a result of the transfer.” (In re: Gardner, 2007 WL 2915847, at *3 (Bankr. D. Utah Feb. 23, 2007).\n\nImplications for HashFast\n\nThe same outcome would occur if a foreign currency is substituted for bitcoins. If the debtor transferred €500, and those euros appreciated over the course of the case, then the trustee should be entitled to recover the €500, even though at the time of recovery it would take more dollars to buy the same number of euros.\n\nLowe argues that the bankruptcy estate should not be returned to its condition prior to transferring the bitcoins to Lowe, and instead should only receive the value at the time of the transfer, even though the law allows the court to award the property transferred to the Trustee.\n\nThe true issue is not whether bitcoin is a currency or commodity, but rather whether bitcoin is US currency or not.\n\nOnce the Bankruptcy Court determines that it is not US currency, the issue will probably be resolved, and bitcoin will be viewed like a non-US currency and treated like a commodity (i.e. similar to gold) under the applicable statute. Accordingly, even if the Bankruptcy Court rules in favor of the Trustee, the resulting opinion will do little to settle the currency versus commodity debate.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The revolution coming about as a result of the cryptocurrency startup, BitFinance, has become a subject of interest to one of the world's most respected institutions of research, Stanford University.\n\nBitFinance is not only revolutionizing the fragile Zimbabwean economy, but could also have an impact on the Bitcoin revolution in Africa as a whole.\n\nHere are some experts’ opinions on the impact of the study on the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nTawanda Kembo is a Bitcoin evangelist and team member at BitFinance. Cointelegraph has asked him why he thinks Stanford University became interested in their company and what impact this is having on the company and the region as a whole. He said:\n\n“I suppose Stanford found the whole idea of a multiple currency country and the prospect of using Bitcoin rather exciting and a worthwhile case to study for business students. More so the fact that a group of friends in a country down through an economic meltdown had woken up one day and decided to make a difference in their own country despite the reality of mammoth challenges. This has generated a feeling of awe, and has put our optimism on steroids. This is not the easiest of businesses to start and we feel uplifted, motivated and encouraged that we are doing something worth recognising. But most of all we are humbled that Stanford so it fit that our ‘hustle’ is study-worthy. And without doubt, publishing of the case is a lot of advertising, which would have cost the company good money to do, our story will definitely reach more audiences and hopefully done in this way it will be less of a task to be taken seriously. We are hopeful that the case will also raise interest among investors from all manner, because this is what we need to catapult ourselves to where we want to be.”\n\nHope for more\n\nTim Frost is the Vice President of Marketing and Business at Wirex Limited, the owners of E-Coin. Tim believes that as more and more institutions dedicate research to evaluating the impact Bitcoin has in the developing world the better, saying that there are a lot of theories out there about the impact that Bitcoin can have in the developing world. He also feels that as more independent studies are performed, it will only become clearer where digital currencies are truly making an impact.\n\nAccording to Tim;\n\n“At E-Coin we feel the P2P infrastructure of Bitcoin is still very immature. As a company we have seen large growth in the handful of African countries we are able to ship to. We receive a lot of feedback that people are receiving Bitcoin as remittance, salary, and a number of different reasons. With their E-Coin card they are able to use their Bitcoin in everyday life. So our company experience is that digital currencies are having a significant positive impact in the developing world.\n\nDigital currencies may be the most misunderstood technology I have ever came across. As a technology there are many advantages to the legacy system but with research such as this and more, we expect the educational process to start to spread. We can only hope more case studies such as this will help shed a light on the positive attributes of blockchain based currencies.”\n\nNational cryptocurrencies inevitable\n\nAnari Sangbe is the Co-Founder at ProducTank. Anari had this to say;\n\n“For those already in the know, the study confirms things we already know. I'm sure other higher institution research will say the same and this is important for the older generation of Africans. Include Stanford or Harvard in your explanation and they listen.\n\nIt is going to be a fascinating watch, when we get to the stage where countries are create their own national cryptocurrency. It is inevitable and studies like this, that engage even the academic skeptic could help countries in Africa lead in that experiment.”\n\nIt is a good development\n\nJoel Cano is a Bitcoin evangelist. Joel said;\n\n“I think is [sic] really good that Academics give public opinions about Bitcoin and blockchain and the challenges faced by startups.”\n\nRoger Ver is also a Bitcoin evangelist and investor. He thinks it is a positive development. Roger said;\n\n“The bigger the Bitcoin ecosystem becomes, the less important any one company or event is. The more people involved the better, so I’m very glad to see things like this taking place.”\n\nJani Valjavec is the Co-Founder at Cashila. In Jani’s words,"", 'Across the world, hackers are taking control of networks, locking away files and demanding sizeable ransoms to return data to the rightful owner. This is the ransomware nightmare, one that a Hollywood hospital has been swallowed up by in the last week. The body confirmed it agreed to pay its attackers $17,000 in Bitcoin to return to some kind of normality. Meanwhile, FORBES has learned of a virulent strain of ransomware called Locky that\'s infecting at least 90,000 machines a day.\n\nThe Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center\'s own nightmare started on 5 February, when staff noticed they could not access the network. It was soon determined hackers had locked up those files and wanted 40 Bitcoins (worth around $17,000) for the decryption key required to unlock the machines. Original reports had put the ransom at 9,000 Bitcoin (worth roughly $3.6 million), but Allen Stefanek, president and CEO of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, said in an official statement they were inaccurate.\n\nDespite receiving assistance from local police and security experts, the hospital chose to pay the attackers. ""The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key. In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.""\n\nReports had indicated some 911 patients had to be diverted to other hospitals, whilst pen and paper had to be used for some registrations and medical records. Stefanek said patient care had not been adversely affected and personal data had not been compromised.\n\nRussian ransomware rampant at 90,000 infections a day\n\nRansomware variants are causing havoc across global networks, but this week saw the emergence of Locky, not a particularly sophisticated malware but one that\'s spreading fast. It asks for between 0.5 and 1 Bitcoin (roughly $420) for users to unlock their files.\n\nKevin Beaumont, a British analyst at a manufacturing company, told FORBES he\'d set up a domain that communicated with the Locky hackers. He estimated more than 100,000 PCs were infected just yesterday, whilst a contact at Fujitsu corroborated those findings, suggesting as many as 90,000 infections were taking place per day from the start of this week. At one point, said Beaumont, connections to his domain peaked at five requests per second. Prior to that it was around 3600 requests per hour - about one per second.\n\nJust three days after its owners kicked off a campaign, around 250,000 PCs were infected, Beaumont wrote in a blog post. He described it as ""a genuine cybersecurity incident"" and a ""masterpiece of criminality"".\n\nSecurity firm Proofpoint has evidence the operators of Dridex, the most active banking malware in the world following the demise of Dyre last week, are spreading Locky. They are disseminating the ransomware in spam emails containing Microsoft Word attachments. Any user that clicks on the attachment risks infection where their anti-virus doesn\'t prevent an attack.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, which also made the connection to Dridex, said the perpetrators had most likely made at least several hundred thousands of dollars in profits with Locky. The firm said in a blog post it believed as many as 400,000 may be infected.', 'Boost VC, the San Mateo-based startup incubator led by CEO Adam Draper, announced \'Tribe 7\' yesterday, its latest group of 20 early-stage startups.\n\nWith its latest batch, Boost\'s portfolio currently stands at 138 companies – 55 working on blockchain products and 34 on virtual reality.\n\nThe incubator now claims to be the most active investor in both of those sectors, adding that a total of over $125m that has been raised by its startups to date.\n\nNotably, while Tribe 5 was dominated by bitcoin and blockchain startups – accounting for 90% of the 25 firms – last year\'s Tribe 6 and now Tribe 7 have seen those numbers drop, first to five and now to four, as Boost increases its focus on virtual reality.\n\nHere are the four blockchain startups joining its latest class:\n\n1.

That is surely just a matter of time.\n\n2. Mailman\n\nMailman describes itself as a service which increases the importance of emails by providing incentives ""with the power of blockchain"".\n\nEffectively, the email sender pays a small bitcoin reward, which Mailman passes to the receiver when they reply to the message.\n\nMailman notifies the reciever of an email and handles the transactions by using ""cutting-edge open-source technologies"".\n\nMailman is a Pakistan-based firm run by CEO Amin Shah Gilani and CTO Rana Waleed Asmat. It works using services by exchange and wallet provider Coinbase and email automation firm Mailgun.\n\n3. Magic. in Bits\n\nThis three-person Israeli startup, headed by CEO Eli Ben Nun, offers a variety of services under the tag line ""Intelligent security for the blockchain"".\n\nFrom an ""intelligent co-signer"" using multi-sig technology for cryptocurrency storage, to supply chain protection, to security audits and compliance checks for blockchain systems, Magic. in Bits is covering a host of blockchain services under a broad security umbrella.\n\nThe firm describes itself on CrunchBase as ""the \'credit score\' for digital currencies with an active layer of defence"", adding:\n\n""We provide a co-signer powered by an analysis engine as a layer that shields transactions from theft and fraud.""\n\n4.

02/19/2016,"['Image caption The smart plug system could help cut power bills and manage energy use in many homes\n\nThe technology behind the Bitcoin virtual currency could help cut electricity bills, suggests research.\n\nA blockchain-based smart plug that can adjust power consumption minute-by-minute has been created by technologists at Accenture.\n\nThe blockchain is the automated ledger that underpins Bitcoin and tracks where the coins are spent and swapped.\n\nThe plug shops for different power suppliers and will sign up for a cheaper tariff if it finds one.\n\nAccenture said the smart plug could help people on low incomes who pay directly for power.\n\nSmart contract\n\nThe smart plug modifies the basic Bitcoin blockchain technology to make it more active, said Emmanuel Viale, head of the Accenture team at the firm\'s French research lab that worked on the plug.\n\nInstead of just resolving and confirming transaction records, the Accenture work has changed the blockchain to let it negotiate deals on behalf of its owner.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The blockchain is an open record of which coins were used in which transactions\n\n""It\'s about how we put more business behaviour or logic into the blockchain,"" said Mr Viale, adding that this essentially embeds a ""smart contract"" into the digital ledger.\n\nThe smart plug prototype works with other gadgets in the house that monitor power use. When demand is high or low it searches for energy prices and then uses the modified blockchain to switch suppliers if it finds a cheaper source.\n\nSo far, said Mr Viale, the Accenture system was just a proof of concept, but it could help many people on lower incomes who pay for their power via a meter.\n\nBeing able to quickly shift suppliers could save this group more than £660m in the UK annually, suggests Accenture research.\n\nA blockchain-based system that can act on behalf of its owner might also prove useful as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous, said Mr Viale.\n\nManaging many different gadgets might be tricky without a more centralised system, he said,\n\nMartin Garner, a mobile services expert at analyst firm CCS Insight, said blockchains were starting to crop up in many different areas including share trading, fishing rights databases and land registry claims.\n\nThey had two chief attractions for the Internet of Things, he said.\n\n""They avoid dependence on any one supplier or ecosystem - some users have concerns about the potential dominance of key internet players creating, for example, the Google-of-Things or the Amazon-of-Things,"" he said.\n\n""The second attraction is as a way of enabling autonomous trading between things, such as the appliances in your house being set up to re-order supplies from a pre-approved list of suppliers,"" he added.', 'Visitors to the Bitcoin Center Buenos Aires, home of Bitcoin Argentina and several bitcoin startups, are reminded of the dramatic saga of bitcoin’s elusive founder Satoshi Nakamoto when they get a glimpse of a comic book on display titled: “BITCOIN The Hunt For Satoshi Nakamoto.” But in addition to drawing attention to one of bitcoin’s greatest mysteries, the comic book has its own story beyond the one told in its pages.\n\nThe comic book, written by Josep Busquet and Alex Preukschat with graphics by Jose Angel Ares Garcia, was announced at the Coin Summit in London in 2014.\n\nThe story covers different perspectives of the cryptocurrency, in addition to the search for Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin. Despite the title, the story does not attempt to determine the identity of bitcoin’s founder.\n\nThe Comic Book’s Real Story\n\nThe comic book’s bigger story is the support it has won from the cryptocurrency community from its inception and the support it continues to provide for bitcoin-related causes.\n\nThe writers began the project in October 2013. They crowdfunded 64 BTC to publish the book, surpassing their original target of 40 BTC. They received support from Bitstamp PLC, Chain Inc., Coinbase Inc. and Xapo Inc.\n\nPreukschat said the mystery behind Satoshi Nakamoto has always intrigued cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He also believed a comic book was a good way to get younger people interested in the cryptocurrency. The comic book’s story is about three parties seeking people they believe to be Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe Latin American Bitcoin Conference in 2014 in Rio de Janeiro auctioned the comic book and gifted back to Bitcoin Argentina by Rocelo Lopez, who won the auction.\n\nIn 2015, fintech advisor Juan Llamos had the comic book signed by bitcoin community members for the conference’s 2015 auction in Mexico City. Auction proceeds benefitted BitGive, a global charity that supports projects such as Team Rubicon, Save the Children, The Water Project, Medic Mobile, a mental health home and more. Less than 1 percent of the charities funds are for fees.\n\nBitcoin Pioneers Approve\n\nMore than 100 bitcoin pioneers worldwide signed the comic book for the 2015 auction, including Nick Szabo, Roger Ver, Patrick Byrne and Vitalik Butterin. Viewers were able to place auction bids on the conference website.\n\nRodolfo Andragnes, the 2015 conference organizer, and Sebastian Wain won the auction together for 20.4 BTC.\n\n“I like that the book is the first of its kind, signed by over 105 bitcoin pioneers committed to a cause, and that it was the work of Spanish entrepreneurs,” Andragnes told CCN. “It was easy for me to support and the main reason we decided to use it as a part of the 2014 auction in Brazil and then as a unique collector’s piece in Mexico.”\n\n“I have always been a supporter of the book, even during the crowdfunding campaign, as I am named in its hall of fame, too. Sebastian and I really wanted to support BitGive’s efforts and projects, and that is why we decided to share the book and pay the full bidding price of 10.2 BTC each.”\n\nAndragnes said he was not aware of any other physical bitcoin comic books.\n\n2015 Conference A Success\n\nThe conference, hosted by Bitcoin Argentina, a non-profit that promotes the cryptocurrency, with support from BitGive, raised a total 25.4 BTC for bitcoin non-profits and the Latin American community.\n\nImages from Bitcoin Comic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor years the conventional wisdom in finance has been that bitcoins are a silly technological game, a bubble, and a fad.\n\nToday: Not so much.\n\nBitcoins have just gotten serious, and people are going to have to start paying attention to this digital currency. That means investors, governments, and those trying to fight crime as well.\n\nThis was already true even before the news out of California that criminals just used bitcoins to extort $17,000 in blackmail from a hospital and make, so far, a clean getaway.\n\nBitcoins are booming. They have doubled in price in the last six months. Indeed bitcoins were actually the best performing currency in the world last year. I ran an exhaustive screen on FactSet, making sure to include everything from the Afghanistan afghani (down 16% against the U.S. dollar DXY, -0.14% ) to the Zambian kwacha (down 42%). Bitcoin trounced them all. The dollar value of each bitcoin jumped 40% during 2015, from $310 to $434. (The currency in second place, the Gambian dalasi of all things, was nowhere near: It rose just 9% against the U.S. dollar.).\n\nAt current prices, the total value of bitcoins in the world now tops $6 billion. That’s quite some “fad.”\n\nI wrote recently about how bitcoins could allow anyone in the U.S. to make a mockery of our (admittedly ridiculous) online gambling laws. The Federal government — and its overseas counterparts — wields tight supervision over the transfer of dollars, yen USDJPY, -0.15% , pounds GBPUSD, +0.0819% , euros EURUSD, +0.0594% , or even Albanian leks through the traditional banking systems. So-called “anti-terrorist” and “anti-money laundering” measures that were hustled through in the panic after 9/11 have basically ended financial privacy.\n\nBut right now, nobody controls bitcoins — and so far they haven’t been able to do much about them.\n\nBitcoins are hard to get your head around until you’ve used them. (Alec Ross’s new book, The Industries of the Future, contains an admirable section explaining the technology.) But in a simplistic nutshell, you can go online and exchange your dollars for bitcoins, transfer those bitcoins anonymously to anyone, anywhere in the world, and they can then exchange them back into dollars — or leks, or yen, or whatever.\n\nThe bitcoin infrastructure isn’t controlled by any entity.\n\nThe entire transaction takes place outside of the banking system. No one has to show any ID to anyone. The exchange rate for bitcoins is set by a freely traded market. And bitcoins have value for the same reason that dollar bills and gold coins have “value” — because lots of people think they do, and they know that other people do as well.\n\nWhat really matters is that the bitcoin infrastructure isn’t controlled by any entity. Not one government, not one company, not even one cooperative. It uses an incredibly ingenious and complex set of programs running on a giant network of independent computers around the world.\n\nBitcoins are the Matrix. They are everywhere and nowhere. And they’re going to be a problem for regulators.\n\nBecause right now the world’s governments are trying to tighten their regulation, supervision and control over any and all transactions bigger than buying a pack of gum.\n\nThis week Harvard professor and establishment mouthpiece Larry Summers joined the fight with a call to scrap certain “big” denomination bills — such as the $100 bill, and maybe even the $50. The reason? They make life too easy for criminals. Cash is anonymous and portable. Summers wants to restrict its use really to small bills used for small transactions.\n\nHe is far from alone. Some of Summers’ Harvard colleagues just published some detailed research on the subject. Governments as far afield as Switzerland and Singapore have stopped printing really, really big bank notes — like one worth about $7,000 — for the same reason. The European Union is considering scrapping the 500-euro note.\n\nBut while the establishment tries to tighten the screws on the anonymous “cash” economy and subject everything to closer and closer regulation, bitcoins are a perfect example of how things can slip through their fingers.\n\nHackers broke into the computer systems at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center earlier this month and crashed them. The hospital said this week that it was so desperate it bowed to the hackers’ demands and paid them a ransom — of 40 bitcoins. The value was just under $17,000.\n\nThe bitcoins were transferred to an anonymous online account with a click of a mouse. No big black bags. No unmarked bills. No getaway car. No chase. No exploding blue paint. Click, and that’s it. It’s a cyberheist.\n\nThe money trail will still leave digital footprints on the web, and the FBI is surely following those right now. But if the criminals were clever the investigators will eventually reach a dead end. The criminals will be caught only if they made a mistake.\n\nThere are plenty of legitimate reasons why someone would use bitcoins for a transaction. It can, for example, be an incredibly quick and cheap way of transferring money. It can be especially useful if you are sending money to relatives in a poor country where the banking system is poor. It can allow you to do things anonymously that are legal but which you prefer to keep private. And in a free society, freedom itself should not need a justification. The burden of proof is on those who would ban something.\n\nYet bitcoins, like cash, can also be used for nefarious purposes.\n\nThe recent Harvard study suggests — guesses, really — that about $3 trillion changes hands each year in international money laundering, drug dealing, terrorist financing, corruption, and other crime. Most of that involves cash. If they can’t use cash, some will find another way. Some will use gold. Some will use one-carat diamonds. Some will use London real estate. And some will use bitcoins.\n\nIf bitcoins are used for just 1% of international criminal transactions that will come to $30 billion a year. The current $6 billion bitcoin monetary base would be turned over five times a year — or bitcoins would rise in price, increasing the size of the base.\n\nNo one is sympathetic to international criminals. Least of all when they are engaged in things like terrorism, human trafficking, or blackmail. You have to be especially sick to attack the computer systems of a hospital. And so this is a problem.\n\nBut the government doesn’t have clean hands either.\n\nGovernments always seize on brief panics and outrages to demand greater restrictions on civil liberties — which they then abuse to harass regular Joes and Joannas.\n\nFor example, a law passed 50 years ago specifically to tackle a small number of extremely rich criminals is now being openly abused by the Treasury to persecute millions of law-abiding middle-class Americans who live abroad. The laws passed after 9/11 to tackle the financing of “international terrists” (sic) were then abused to stop people paying $10 craps games on the Internet. Laws put on the books to stop money laundering were abused just last fall to secure criminal convictions against former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Dennis Hastert. His “crime”? Paying a blackmailer. With his own money.\n\nBitcoin is going to be the next battle over financial regulation and civil liberties. And don’t be fooled. There will be arguments, and lies, on both sides.', ""REGISTER | LOGIN PROFILE | LOGOUT Sign Up / Sign In Forgot your password?

The company suggested that the deal arose from the firm\'s experiences in different cybercrime cases that enable it to give guidelines for investigators when tracing bitcoin funds.\n\nMichael Gronager, the firm\'s CEO, said in a statement:\n\n""This new collaboration is an important next step in the endeavour to move digital currencies out of the hands of the criminals and into the hands of consumers and blooming commerce.""\n\nEuropol (European Police Office) is the law enforcement agency of the European Union and has headquarters in the Hague in the Netherlands.\n\nFocus on crypto security\n\nWhile blockchain technology is now widely seen as having major disruptive potential in many different applications and industries, Chainalysis said this enthusiasm has been tempered by negative press where digital currency applications of the technology have been connected to fraud and cybercrime.\n\nA prime example of this, the firm said, being the recent extortion of the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. After millions were demanded, the hospital was eventually forced to pay $17,000 to regain control of its computer systems from hackers.\n\nChainalysis also cites a Europol report published last year, that said cybercrime is quickly growing and bitcoin is becoming the go-to currency for digital criminals.\n\nThe company hopes to change that through tracking digital identities on the blockchain, and said its software is able to detect suspicious activity in real time and provide investigation tools that can assist law enforcement agencies in their work.\n\n""This is done through a proprietary database of metadata associated to bitcoin transactions. It is at this point that the criminals are most vulnerable,"" Levin explained.\n\nNotably, Chainalysis is one of a growing number of firms working to develop blockchain compliance solutions, with competitors including startups such as Polycoin and Coinalytics.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Chainalysis.\n\nImage via robert paul van beets / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

When you first get into bitcoin there are a whole host of products out there and it can be pretty overwhelming with terminology such as hierarchical deterministic or multi signature technology being bandied about.\n\nSo how do you pick the best bitcoin wallet for your needs – well that depends on what you want to do with it, how simple you want it to be and how security conscious you are. Generally the more security you want – the more difficult it is to use and the more anonymous.\n\nMobile Wallets, Web Wallets or Desktop Wallets\n\nThis is how you want to access your wallet – and there are loads of different ways to do this. Most people want simplicity, to pull out their phone, swipe a QR code and check their balance – and this is where the most popular wallets are heading. They try to make the user experience as seamless as possible – one click good two clicks bad.\n\nSome wallets try to give you a spread of accessibility options – the ability to use it on your phone as an App and also to access it on your browser. Although generally this means handing over trust of your bitcoins to a third party.\n\nThe first Bitcoin wallet was the Bitcoin core client which is essentially running a full node of your computer. This involves downloading the entire blockchain which can take a long time and take up a lot of space on your computer – and is now really only for the tech aficionados.\n\nSecurity in a Wallet\n\nThe main thing to do with security is where the private keys are kept. For ease of use some web wallets and mobile wallets keep your keys stored on their servers. The problem is that you have to trust this third party to firstly not run of with your funds and secondly to have high enough security so no hacker can break in and steal your Bitcoins.\n\nHardware wallets are one form of very secure device as they keep your private key on a separate piece of hardware. The problem is that they are time consuming to set up and are not fully future proof. But generally these are for the more security conscious – if you like your own private high security bitcoin vault. Just whatever you do – don’t lose them.\n\nOne thing you shouldn’t do is use a brain wallet! Brain wallets are really easy hack as they use your password to create a private key which can then be guessed by trial and error (a brute force attack).\n\nBitcoin Wallet Features\n\nThere are a variety of extra features that wallets tack on to their offerings. For example Airbitz plugs 20% off starbucks vouchers. All you need to do is go into your wallet click buy voucher and then get the Barista to scan it – 5 seconds and its 20% off your morning coffee.\n\nAnother feature that is very useful is the ability to buy and sell bitcoins. These come with exchange linked wallets, for example Coinbase where you can buy bitcoin on your debit card and then pay with it by using you Iphone or Android Phone. If you are a trader this feature is a must have to get in and out of your positions at an instant.\n\nA further feature that is becoming a bonus to have attached to your wallet is a bitcoin debit card – or to be more accurate a prepaid currency card. The wallet provider will exchange your bitcoin for you and convert it to USD, EUR, or GBP – depending on their offerings and obviously for a fee. These cards have varying fees for differing uses – for example if you want to use them at a shop till you might have to pay each time you use it and the same principle when you take money out of an ATM. They can also have very high currency conversion costs if you want to use the card to buy something abroad.\n\nThe good news is you can compare all the bitcoin debit cards at CryptoCompare where we have added special metrics to each card to work out how much you would lose by spending $1000 dollars or £1000 on the card and using it at ATM’s or in shops.\n\nYou can also Compare all the wallets too and rank them by security level, extra features and where you can use the wallet.\n\nData Courtesy of CryptoCompare', ""When US-based online retailer, Overstock.com, began accepting Bitcoin at the beginning of 2014, the state of New Hampshire delivered the highest sales per capita of any state, relegating the company’s home state of Utah to second place. This was largely due to the presence in New Hampshire of the Free State Project, a political movement whose members tend to believe in decentralized and non-governmental forms of currency, making them very receptive to Bitcoin.\n\nBecause of New Hampshire’s high concentration of tech-minded entrepreneurs, combined with its historically-high rating overall freedom ranking, the state has developed a robust Bitcoin ecosystem, allowing its residents to operate off of a 100%-cryptocurrency income.\n\nWorld’s longest-running Bitcoin meetup\n\nManchester, New Hampshire is home to what its attendees claim to be the longest-running consecutive weekly Bitcoin meetup in the world. Zach Harvey, CEO and co-founder of BTM manufacturer Lamassu, founded the meetup with his brother and business partner Josh Harvey.\n\n“My brother started the Manchester Bitcoin Meetup in July 2012, right after the 2012 Porcfest which was a huge booster for Bitcoin. Porcfest 2012 was one of the first times many of us got to actually use Bitcoin to buy and trade on a daily basis. For Bitcoin enthusiasts, it was a move from talking about Bitcoin and theorizing to using it in practice. That's what led to having a weekly meeting, to experience using Bitcoin once a week. And of course talking about it as well.”\n\nMatt Whitlock, longtime attendee of the weekly meetup, has been able to easily acquire or offload Bitcoin between private parties whenever desired.\n\n“It's very easy to trade Bitcoins at the meetups. There's always someone looking to buy or sell. Of course, depending on recent market price movements, finding someone willing to trade at spot may be more or less difficult.”\n\nRent for Bitcoin\n\nMatthew Ping, owner of Ledgeview Commercial Properties, is one of the several property owners in the Manchester area that accepts Bitcoin for rent payments.\n\n“To my knowledge I'm the only property management company that accepts Bitcoin in New Hampshire. I know of a few property owners who rent out rooms and would accept Bitcoin.”\n\nA resident of the Freecoast region (another name for New Hampshire’s coast), Mike Vine, LBRY’s technology evangelist, also runs a coworking and event space called the Praxeum, which accepts Bitcoin for membership dues.\n\n“There has been a lot of interest. Bitcoin is a very popular means of exchange in our Freecoast community… coworking is a natural market for Bitcoiners. Both communities tend to be tech-oriented, free-spirited, and avante-garde.”\n\nBitcoin-friendly businesses of all types\n\nCoinmap.org lists more businesses accepting Bitcoin in New Hampshire than in Massachusetts immediately to the south, despite having less than one-fifth the population, and lacking a major metropolitan area like Boston.\n\nWithin 20 minutes drive of downtown Manchester, Bitcoin-accepting businesses include pubs (including one of New Hampshire’s top-rated establishments), a pizza restaurant, a chocolate shop, a barber shop, a construction company, and two separate law offices. Elsewhere in the state, Bitcoin is accepted at a farm, a gas station, a silver mint, a news stand, and a firearms manufacturer. Finally, as has been publicized by CoinTelegraph before, ride-sharing service Arcade City, which officially launched earlier this month, allows drivers to accept Bitcoin payments.\n\nThe underground market\n\nUnique to New Hampshire’s Bitcoin scene is the Community Market Day project, a decentralized marketplace featuring dozens of vendors, many of whom are clandestine. Jessica Love, the initiator of the project, also vends bulletproof coffee, receiving about one-third of her sales in Bitcoin.\n\n“The vendors may vary some but typically a [Community Market Day Manchester] event has at least 10 out of the 12 - 15 vendors accepting Bitcoin. There are [Community Market Day] event hubs being opened over the next few months in 3-4 different areas around the Free State on rotating weekends where more Bitcoin users will be attracted to vending.”\n\nLove has seen all manner of goods and services being sold for Bitcoin at the various market days around the state.\n\n“But seriously, there are lots of products and services that you can pay for with Bitcoin at [Community Market Day] events. Farm meats, eggs, produce, honey, and such raised by friends and neighbors. Organic soaps, candles, coffee & tea, jewelry, crochet goods, household items, crafts, and more. Services too - massage, chiropractic care, and even hypnotherapy. I believe that anything that can be brought to this market model and traded for Bitcoin should be. We are living the ultimate agorist experiment of an off the grid economy and beginning to implement the currency. I do see Bitcoin interest growing in the market. As more products become available in exchange for it, people seem happy to transfer more of their business to the new free market local economy that we are building here. The Community Market Day Project and Bitcoin are a winning combination.”\n\nThe world’s most Bitcoin-friendly community\n\nIt is very possible to live entirely off of Bitcoin in New Hampshire, as Whitlock has done.\n\n“I took a cue from Erik Vorhees and cashed out early. Cashed out of dollars and into Bitcoins, that is. I only hold as much in dollars as I need to pay the current month's expenses.”\n\nHarvey, having traveled the world for his business, Lamassu, still finds New Hampshire to be the most Bitcoin-friendly.\n\n“You don't get more Bitcoin-friendly than New Hampshire, specifically the Free State Project community. People are always discussing it with local businesses and now you can buy boutique chocolates, pizza and beer in Manchester. When Overstock started accepting Bitcoin, half the community bought something just to show support. I bought a towel set.”\n\nWhen asked how friendly New Hampshire is to Bitcoin compared with the rest of the world, Whitlock responded without hesitation."", 'Long-time bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik and industry investor Matt Roszak have teamed up to launch Bloq, a new startup ambitiously billed as a ""Red Hat for blockchain"", in a nod to the $1bn open-source software company.\n\nBacked by $250,000 in capital from Roszak’s firm Tally Capital, co-founders Garzik and Roszak said that Bloq aims to provide a engagement layer for enterprises companies that may otherwise be uncertain about dedicating resources to engineering and strategy efforts that leverage open-source blockchain technology.\n\nThough the company debuted in a high-profile article on Bloomberg, the article was perhaps short on how Bloq would implement its vision, and in particular, its theses on the underlying tech for which it would offer services.\n\nIn a new interview, Garzik framed Bloq\'s vision as one that sees the industry evolving toward a ""multi-chain, multi-token"" ecosystem in which bitcoin will serve as the ""root of an Internet of chains"".\n\nAs such, Bloq\'s products take advantage of bitcoin’s features, including its secure blockchain, well-developed code base and global community.\n\nGarzik framed Bloq as a startup aiming to emulate the tested formula created by Red Hat, which he contends was able to successfully mediate between a sometimes divided Linux community and businesses that wanted to build on the open-source operating system that ecosystem had developed.\n\n""Red Hat stepped in,"" Garzik, who is himself a 10-year veteran of that company, explained. ""Red Hat was the commercial enterprise that could listen to [enterprise] needs, plot them on a long term roadmap and manage the engineering and development of those features with the rough-and-tumble Linux community.""\n\nThe common theme in Bloq’s products, Garzik said, is that they will come with the support that large companies require when seeking to leverage open-source tech, adding:\n\n""Enterprise customers need more than a volunteer, ad-hoc support effort. They need contractual deadlines for responses. Professional \'this feature by X date\' product management and more.""\n\nTo date, Bloq has already scored high-profile partnerships with industry startups Circle and Noble Markets, and is in discussions with PwC about its offering. PwC said it is still evaluating a more formal engagement with the startup.\n\nRoszak said that Bloq so far boasts 12 employees, and that it will seek to double its staff as it scales its operations. Apart from Garzik, notable saffers include Andreas Schildbach, who today runs the Java-based application development library Bitcoinj.\n\n""We are just about to build out a more formal sales and marketing initiative, but it’s going to be calibrated. We\'re building a company for the next 20 years,"" Roszak said.\n\nProduct line\n\nAt launch, Bloq is billing itself as an ""enterprise-grade blockchain"" service, with initial products including BloqEnterprise, BloqSuite and BloqThink.\n\nGarzik described BloqEnterprise as offering supported access to the bitcoin network, clarifying that it is best considered a ""bitcoin specific"" product.\n\nSpecifically, BloqEnterprise includes a supported version of the command-line interface bitcoind; libraries such as the bitcoin network’s replacement for OpenSSL, libsecp256k1; and bitcoinJ, a client library written in Java. Garzik said that a Python library is also on the way.\n\nAdditional products at launch include BloqSuite, its proof-of-concept development offering; and BloqThink, its strategic advisory and consulting service.\n\nBoth, he said, are aimed at striking a balance between high-level strategy and low-level engineering, and are more agnostic in how they will approach working with blockchain technologies other than bitcoin.\n\n""BloqThink is \'default bitcoin\',"" Garzik said. ""[It\'s] bitcoin-centric, but not bitcoin-required. We can handle Ethereum-related proofs-of-concept.""\n\nRoszak similarly said that Bloq is focused on helping enterprises build an ""Internet stack"" in the same way that they built e-commerce platforms in the 1990s.\n\n""We’re seeing a world where you’re going to have a constellation of chains, whether it\'s Ripple, Ethereum or bitcoin, there\'s going to be connective tissue of common software layers,"" he said. ""If we want that ecosystem to scale, we need to give [enterprises] those common denominator tools.""\n\nUnrivaled support\n\nRoszak estimated that, today, Bloq has a dozen customers who see value in its model because of its ability to allow businesses to access open-source blockchains, without having to hire full-time developers to help adapt the protocol to their needs.\n\n""They don’t want to hire five Core devs because they want to manage this wallet or a private chain, they want to build applications for vertical markets, whether it’s health records or clearing and settlement,"" Roszak said.\n\nUnique to its offering is that Bloq aims to offer 24/7 support to its clients, in an effort to better assuage concerns about working with open-source tech. Bloq engineers will also implement features needed by clients into bitcoin’s code, in a similar fashion as industry startup Blockstream.\n\nGarzik described this work as implementing the ""scaffolding"" that has perhaps so far led enterprise businesses to seek to create private blockchain solutions.\n\n""Open-source projects can be of very uneven quality,"" Garzik said. ""That\'s really what the Red Hat model is all about – working with the community, yet taking it up a notch, bringing enterprise clients the support that open source doesn\'t by default provide.""\n\nHe further described private blockchains as ""inevitable"", but posited that using bitcoin\'s code for such projects may be the best way to ensure there is compatibility between all blockchain and distributed ledger systems.\n\nEx-factors\n\nOf course, given the budget and experience of the Red Hat team, Garzik and Roszak also addressed the need for a company like Bloq even if Red Hat were to enter the market.\n\nRoszak said Bloq would benefit from an imbalance in the amount of interest in the space and the amount of qualified professionals who can work with the new technologies needed to carry out this vision.\n\nBecause of the early stage of the technology, however, he said he believes companies like Oracle and Red Hat are unlikely to offer such solutions in the near-term, and that they may even become customers of Bloq given its collected expertise.\n\n""We look at ourselves as partners to these companies in terms of our go-to market and how we view the ecosystem,"" he said.\n\nGarzik also addressed why he is not concerned about building Bloq as a service focused on the bitcoin blockchain, even amidst the current turmoil in its development community.\n\nThough Garzik is one of the developers working on Bitcoin Classic, an effort seeking to scale the bitcoin network\'s transaction capacity through a hard fork, he sees Bloq as ""policy neutral"".\n\n""We are very happy to support customers with Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Classic consensus rules, and that is what we will do moving forward,"" he said.\n\nGarzik pointed to past posts in which he stated he believes both versions of the bitcoin software suffer from governance issues, but that ultimately, Bloq\'s function is not to present problems to technical debate, but provide choice to customers seeking to navigate such decisions as necessary to their business\n\n""We provide the choice, and then step back and let the customers choose,"" Garzik said, concluding:\n\n""Fortune 100 customers shouldn\'t have to worry about all the minute details of bitcoin forking. They should have a menu of informed options, and choose from there.""\n\nImage credit: Kobby Dagan / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

For instance, Chain\'s partnership with NASDAQ signals that the market is finding ways to leverage blockchain technology to solve organizational problems while also communicating with the status quo, he says.\n\nUniquely poised\n\nBut Dwolla isn’t in the business of determining which assets are moving, just ensuring that the cash equivalent for those assets passes between existing financial institutions.\n\n""Dwolla has a very interesting asset in [its] alternative payment network which they’ve had before bitcoin and Ripple,"" says Gil Luria, an analyst focusing on bitcoin at Wedbush Securities.\n\nDwolla launched in 2010 and from its meager start in Des Moines, Iowa, with just a few small bank and retailer clients and two employees, it has grown to 50 employees and 500,000 customers processing more than $1bn annually.\n\nOver the past few years, the company has built relationships with government entities in Iowa, speeding up the payment of cigarette stamp tax, vehicle registration and fuel tax. In October 2014, BBVA Compass partnered with Dwolla for its FiSync real-time payments platform.\n\n""They’re leveraging a trend right now in financial institution investment to bridge the gap between the blockchain and traditional financial institutions,"" Luria says.\n\nRipple, R3, Digital Asset Holdings, Eris, Overstock’s tØ and many other bitcoin startups that have pivoted recently, including Chain and Gem, are working in this area.\n\nBlythe Masters of Digital Asset Holdings has spoken specifically about how blockchain technology could change the way bankers and investors trade bonds and loans.\n\nBut it’s still early days, says Luria, and Dwolla might be at a slight disadvantage because Milne has been vocal in the past about his skepticism with bitcoin. Although Luria doesn’t suspect this will be too much of an impediment since many of the initial bitcoin companies and entrepreneurs have been overtaken by a new group that sees bitcoin as just one specific implementation of a blockchain network.\n\nInfluence of Mt Gox\n\nOf course, this group may also view Dwolla as uniquely experienced given its firsthand issues with bitcoin firms, including Mt Gox, the insolvent bitcoin exchange that would later lose hundreds of millions in customer funds.\n\nThe incident may have arguably marked the high water mark for bitcoin as a currency, coinciding with its loss in value over 2014, and with this loss, a decline in investor interest.\n\nMonths before, however, the US Department of Homeland Security seized more than $2.9m from Dwolla’s Mt. Gox account under suspicion that the bitcoin exchange was operating as an unlicensed money transmitter.\n\nMilne isn\'t worried about the past, though, suggesting blockchain offers the company a chance to begin anew in using bitcoin-inspired technology to solve pressing business problems.\n\nMilne concluded:\n\n""In our eyes, blockchain and bitcoin are totally different. Blockchain isn’t about currency exchange; it’s about recording, managing and moving assets.""\n\nImage via Facebook\n\nThis article has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

02/20/2016,"['A group of bitcoin miners constituting close to 80% of the network hashrate, as well representatives from exchanges, service providers and contributors to the Bitcoin Core development project, have proposed a development timeline for scaling the bitcoin network.\n\nThe statement’s release comes after a more than 18 hour-long meeting in Hong Kong that drew participants from China\'s bitcoin mining community and members of the Bitcoin Core team.\n\nSome of the letter\'s signatories were party to a previous statement that voiced opposition to any ""contentious hard fork"" to the bitcoin network.\n\nAccording the proposed timeline, Bitcoin Core contributors Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Cory Fields, Johnson Lau and Peter Todd will produce and recommend code for a hard fork to the bitcoin network that would feature a block size increase. The code for this proposal is expected to be made available by July.\n\nThis proposal would be presented three months after the release of Segregated Witness, a proposed change to bitcoin\'s code that alters the way in which bitcoin transaction signature data is stored.\n\nRepresentatives for miners AntPool, A-XBT, BitFury, Bitmain, BTCC, BW, F2Pool, GHash.io and Genesis Mining have agreed to support Segregated Witness, expected to be released in April. According to data from Blockchain.info, the larger miners on the list of signatories have produced roughly 80% of all blocks in recent days.\n\nThe group went on to say that, following approval by the volunteer Bitcoin Core team and a show of “strong community support”, it would support the deployment of that hard fork – a change to the network that would require users to download new software in order to stay compatible – with activation taking place sometime “around July 2017”.\n\nThe statement reads:\n\n“This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.”\n\nFurther, the statement indicated that the signatories would, for now, only use production versions of the Core software.\n\n“We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production, for the foreseeable future,” it said.\n\nThis reflects a change from a previous version of the statement published online that featured stronger language in the commitment to use Core over other alternatives. Later removed, it said that the group would “not run Bitcoin Classic”, a reference to the alternative implementation released earlier this month that includes code for a transaction block size increase to 2 megabyte (MB) versus the current 1 MB per block.\n\nA full list of signatories can be found here.\n\nImage Credit: Alex Petrov\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

We could, therefore, expect to see price go vertical which will be both the hallmark of the fifth wave, as well as our signal to expect a top for the price wave that started below $400.\n\nThe top may be some distance higher in the chart, with Fib extensions indicating $460 and $470 as likely targets – coincidentally, at the level of the December and January highs.\n\nWhat happens after that will be interesting. Typically, the bitcoin chart retraces at least 50% of a price move, but in the current 1-day chart (not shown) we see a significant xbt.social buy signal forming. So, either price will form a shallow retracement of the advance to date, or the chart may make the expected 50% retracement very rapidly before turning back up.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price is accelerating to the upside in a manner that frequently results in a price spike. According to two evident Fibonacci extension projections the wave top should form around the December and January highs, although the spike may extend much higher.

Because these banks largely left it up to telecom companies to assume the role of financial service providers in parts of Africa, the banks are now investing in digital currency startups, according to Quartz Africa. The question is how long will it take.\n\nMbwana Alliy, a managing partner at the Savannah Fund, a technology venture company, said a headwind of fintech disruption is blowing from Europe and Silicon Valley into Africa.

The report explored the many benefits that mobile commerce can bring to a developing country.\n\nAfrican Banking Set To Disrupt\n\nVinny Lingham, the South African entrepreneur who started the Civic blockchain enterprise in Silicon Valley, said the banking sector will disrupt in Africa faster than in any place in the world. He said the blockchain and bitcoin provide a trustless operating method that does not require third parties such as banks. The blockchain will circumvent today’s existing financial infrastructure the way in which mobile technology circumvented fixed communication lines in Africa.\n\nBarclay’s, in response to this challenge, in December 2015 established the first African branch of Rise, the company’s global network of innovation spaces. The branch’s goal is to support fintech entrepreneurs who otherwise would not be within the bank’s reach.\n\nArian Lewis, head of Barclay’s Open Innovation, said Africans bank on their mobile phones while the Barclay’s talent base rests on brick and mortar banking. “So we’re thinking, are we actually a tech company? To make that shift, you have to approach talent that sits at the front end of that change curve,” he said.\n\nBarclay’s Supports Innovation\n\nBarclay’s Africa operates in 13 African nations and hopes that the work space, run by TechStars, a U.S. chain, combined with access to its customers, will deliver new ways of thinking which Barclay’s can’t conceive by itself. Barclay’s Africa is 62% owned by Barclay’s Plc.\n\nWarren Squires, head of Seeker Fund, Barclay’s Africa’s venture capital fund, said startups can grow faster and can find ways around problems that banks can’t since they don’t have the red tape and a wider global vision.\n\nConsent, a startup that underwent the bank’s pilot accelerator in 2015 in Cape Town, is one of Barclay’s first blockchain collaborations.\n\nShaun Conway, co-founder of Consent, said Barclay’s is attempting to define what it will become. He referred to it as a midlife crisis for the bank.\n\nConsent initially used blockchain to build fidelity with individual medical records over different databases. The startup saw how Barclay’s can use Consent’s system to comply with the know-your-customer (KYC) rules in the short term and protect customer identities in the long term.\n\nFollowing the accelerator, Consent secured a one-year contract to build a proof-of-concept for the bank for more than one million dollars.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin and blockchain will help Africa achieve global inclusiveness, says Kenyan blockchain incubator founder\n\nSpecial Focus On Africa\n\nBarclay’s is working with blockchain startups globally, but it sees special application in Africa. Lewis said blockchain could be the most important political and social innovation to affect Africa in 100 years. A blockchain-based digital economy can hold African leaders to a higher level of accountability. Lewis said digital currencies could significantly reduce government corruption and offer transparency to citizens.\n\nBitcoin’s application as a general purpose ledger expanding beyond cryptocurrencies is open to debate. Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of BitX, a South African-born startup, says blockchain is not the magic ray of sunlight people seek. He said people think if they put something on the blockchain the counterparty risk goes away.\n\nConsidering deeds or diamonds or shares, you essentially tokenize something, but you still must trust the person who made the asset’s token really holds the asset. Fraud occurs when someone loads something onto the system. The fraud is not within the system itself.\n\nBitcoin, which has inherent and tradeable value, does not have counterparty risk, Swanepoel said, making it especially desirable in Africa.\n\nBitX currently sees more uptake in Southeast Asia than in Africa, but it actually originated in an African bank. It began as Switchless which piloted a Standard Bank bitcoin system in 2013.\n\nSwitchless never debuted to the public, but it used its proof of concept to secure traction globally and later raised a Series A financing round from Naspers, a South African e-commerce and media conglomerate, in late 2015.\n\nAnother Bank Enters The Fray\n\nStandard Chartered, Standard Bank’s parent, is entering the fray. In mid-2015, the company’s chief innovation officer called blockchain a force for good in a posting and added that blockchain could eventually cut costs for financial services such as credit cards, remittances and money transfers, opening these services up to people who can’t afford them.\n\nBitcoin as the interoperable system currency for converting between African currencies could make cross-border trade easier.\n\nThe Savannah Fund has invested in BitFinance, a Zimbabwean bitcoin startup, to test the above-mentioned thesis, which a Stanford Business School case study has detailed. The country’s national currency collapse gave rise to several currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan, making it an ideal country to pilot bitcoin as a back-end trading currency. Equally important to the Savannah Fund’s Alliy was the local team’s good relations with the central bank.\n\nAlliy said the company is working with the central bank to see how bitcoin can fit the Zimbabwe ecosystem. “We’re not just going in on a Silicon Valley-style disrupt model.”\n\nFintech Startups Face Challenges\n\nAlliy said it is important to work with established players. In Africa, fintech startups face obstacles and have to comply with complex regulations and navigate political power networks that vary by country. The technology needed to handle money requires bank-grade security, and fintech talent is expensive.\n\nCash can be hard to secure in Africa. There are not a lot of venture capitalists, and they often require more proof of traction than a young fintech startup can demonstrate. As banks increase activity in early stages, they seek to partner their big corporate cultures to the small early-stage startups.\n\nConway at Consent said the journey to getting things done is difficult. Even with top-level executive support, the organization is not geared to moving as quickly as the startup.\n\nHowever, 454 fintech companies have applied to Barclays Cape Town TechStars accelerator, which begins on March 29.\n\nExperienced entrepreneurs such as Lingham are skeptical any startup will be game changers.\n\n“I applaud what they’re doing but I’ve yet to see a corporate-sponsored VC fund, accelerator or incubator ever create a business that disrupts an industry,” he said.\n\nLingham, for his part, invests in African startups but not financial services.\n\nEven the more optimistic observers acknowledge the journey for these startups will be long. Lewis at Barclay’s says it will be ten years before everyone has full access to the Internet, which is what is needed to enable a digital currency economy.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'MIT Technology Review is weighing in again on the issue of Bitcoin scalability with an article titled “Technical Roadblock Might Shatter Bitcoin Dreams.” The question is whether the Bitcoin network could be scaled up to support thousands of transactions per second, like the world’s major payment networks. The answer is no, unless the Bitcoin code is radically re-engineered.\n\nThe debate has been going on for months. In May 2015, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Bitcoin Core developers were disagreeing on the optimal block size, a parameter that is directly related to the throughput of the Bitcoin network. As things stand, the Bitcoin network can process only a few transactions per second, which could strongly limit the ability of the network to handle high transaction volumes if the adoption of bitcoin payments grows.\n\nOn February 26 a team of researchers from Cornell University, The University of California, Berkeley, ETH Zurich, the National University of Singapore, and the University of Maryland, will present a paper titled ""On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains"" at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2016 conference, organized by the International Financial Cryptography Association and IACR.\n\nAuthor Ari Juels, a cryptographer and professor at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech and a director of the Initiative for Crypto-Currencies and Contracts (IC3), is persuaded that the scaling proposals currently on the table for discussion, centered on increasing the block size, would have little effect.\n\nIn fact, according to Juels, no tweak to Bitcoin could allow transactions at a scale close to the thousands of transactions per second processed by global payment networks such as Visa, without compromising Bitcoin\'s decentralized design. “We have to think in terms of a fundamental redesign if we’re going to see robust scaling in Bitcoin,” said Juels.\n\n“Today’s representative blockchain such as Bitcoin takes 10 min or longer to confirm transactions, achieves 7 transactions/sec maximum throughput,” note the researchers. “In comparison, a mainstream payment processor such as Visa credit card confirms a transaction within seconds, and processes 2000 transactions/sec on average, with a peak rate of 56,000 transactions/sec.”\n\nBitcoin works by discovering blocks of confirmed transactions at approximate intervals, and its transaction throughput is limited by factors like the maximum block size, the average transaction size, and the block interval.\n\nAfter an extensive analysis of the factors that limit the throughput of the Bitcoin network, the researchers conclude that reparametrization of the block size and interval in Bitcoin is only a first step toward substantial throughput and latency improvements while retaining significant system decentralization.\n\n“More aggressive scaling will in the longer term require fundamental protocol redesign,” note the researchers.\n\nA conclusion of the study is that, in the current design of Bitcoin Core, there is a fundamental conflict between throughput and decentralization. An optimal block size of four megabytes could permit a throughput of about 27 transactions per second in the Bitcoin network, but the price to pay for further increases would be making the Bitcoin system more centralized.\n\nFor example, using a standard Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) replication protocol with a small number of pre-designated trusted entities would permit improved scaling, but decentralization carries a performance cost.\n\nThe discussion of the possible ways ahead is rather theoretical and generic, and the researchers don’t propose a solution. The goal, they say, “is not to propose an end-to-end system, but rather to paint the design space, suggest promising approaches, and pose open challenges to the community.”\n\nThe promising approaches outlined by the researchers include lightning networks and sidechains able to exploit faster and more efficient protocols while still using Bitcoin as a currency.\n\nMIT Technology Review notes that many companies are developing private non-Bitcoin blockchains and “permissioned” blockchains where transactions can be validated only by vetted participants. Private blockchains that don’t require high throughput, for example those envisaged for inter-bank settlements, are less vulnerable to congestion than the public Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nLegendary cryptographer Adam Back, a co-founder of Blockstream, a well-funded company active in the lightning networks and sidechains space, agrees that new technology is needed to scale up Bitcoin, but is persuaded that the community will be up to the challenge. “There’s strong interest from academia, lots of new technology coming in the next 18 months, and a lot of funding coming to the industry,” he says, as reported by MIT Technology Review.\n\nA full version of the research paper will be available on the IC3 website. The URL given (ref. 10) isn’t active yet, but presumably the full paper will be there after the presentation on February 26.\n\nPhoto Roland Dobbins / Flickr(CC)', 'In 1919, Benito Mussolini coined the term “fascism” to describe his political system and the world forever changed. Simply put, fascism was the blending of business and government. This is the system which could gain popularity in blockchain technology.\n\nIn 2015, the technology and financial sectors took note of blockchain technology, not as it relates to Bitcoin, but, rather, how it could relate to their general business practices, models and theories. We’ve seen this innovation in perception march forward as the private sector – via consortiums and corporate labs – explores the innovation kicked off by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nTalk in the space often focuses on the different types of blockchains which could be designed: private, public-private and public, the latter being the Bitcoin model.\n\nModern industrial societies are neither Capitalist nor are they Socialist. Instead, they represent “the third way” of possible outcomes of political thought in the nineteen and twentieth centuries, which were arguably inspired by laissez-faire (classical liberalism, Capitalism) and the opposing left-wing ideologies (Communism, Socialism).\n\nIn a synergy of opposing notions, modern societies are created out of a melange of Capitalism and Communism. US policy expert Zbigniew Brzezinski discusses “commercial capitalism.” This term, which he uses to describe the current economic and political systems in China, can be applied to the Democratic-Socialist nation-states in the west. It’s basically a society in which partnerships between government bodies (local and national) and private entities (big and small) are crucial for the fabric of society.\n\nThese ideological paradigms express themselves in Bitcoin Proper, where socialist and capitalists theorize how Bitcoin belongs to their ideological family tree.\n\nLike an emerald in a field, Bitcoin and blockchain technology will reflect the society in which they exist. It’s plausible that Bitcoin finds itself fractured just like the many dissident and activist movements “in real life” fighting for social change. Further, considering the interest posed by major players in industry, technology and government, it’s reasonable to think partnerships between private entities and public entities, united by blockchain technology, dictates the management of the blockchain database or exchange system which they deploy. In Bitcoin proper, E-Gov and BitPay efforts offer an example how private entities and public entities can partner on blockchain forward initiatives.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As business giants and governments are moving to explore Blockchain, the distributed ledger system that is behind Bitcoin, Microsoft is to build a “Certified Blockchain Marketplace”.\n\nMicrosoft Azure platform\n\nBitcoin’s value had earlier seen a $20 surge when Microsoft had announced plans to integrate Bitcoin into its Windows and Xbox digital payments system, though the initiative failed to garner widespread support.\n\nHowever, Microsoft is now moving forward and experimenting with the technology behind Bitcoin, Blockchain - the distributed ledger system on which Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built.\n\nBlockchain technology has sparked a lot of interest among the researchers and Fortune 500 companies recently. Microsoft is also trying to utilize the revolutionary technology to its advantage by building what it is terming a “certified blockchain marketplace” on Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that is used for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of datacenters.\n\nMicrosoft had already launched its blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) on its Azure platform in November, 2015, but the new initiative will have a “certified blockchain marketplace” and the participants will have to undergo a more rigorous testing than the existing BaaS.\n\nA number of companies are investigating the possible uses of Blockchain in finance and trade, but Microsoft says it is not going to compete with the other companies, and will try to be the platform company it has always been.\n\nIBM Blockchain conference\n\nAs per reports, the CEO of IBM, Ginni Rometty will announce the company’s plans for developing Blockchain technology at a conference on Tuesday, February 23rd, 2016.\n\nIBM has been working on its own version of the blockchain technology and plans to test it this year.\n\nBlockchain— the technology behind Bitcoin— is mostly associated with cryptocurrencies but now it is making its way into other sectors as well, especially finance and trade.\n\nIBM has contributed code to the Hyperledger project of the Linux Foundation. Hyperledger project seeks to advance blockchain technology by identifying and addressing important features and gaps in technology. Accenture, Intel, JP Morgan, Cisco, and Hitachi and some other prominent companies that are part of the Hyperledger project among many other companies working to advance blockchain technology.\n\nIBM has also stated that two of its high-profile customers, London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Japan Exchange Group (JEG) are already exploring ways of using blockchain technology.\n\nIBM will also establish “IBM Garages” in prominent cities globally such as, New York, London, Singapore, and Tokyo, where customers get to experiment with the company’s blockchain software.\n\nWill Bitcoin Suffer?\n\nAs per Michael Terpin, the Chairman of BitAngels, believe the presence of big name players is a double-edged sword for bitcoin. While it certainly brings credibility to the digital asset sector, most of the current crop of innovation in the blockchain area is deliberately independent of Bitcoin.\n\nHe further added:\n\n“I believe the new business battle on the blockchain front will be between private blockchains (centrally controlled) vs. ones that at least have a tie-in to cryptocurrencies. This will be the central issue of 2016 - and IBM, Microsoft etc see this as a huge opportunity to put their own fingerprint on it as the ""stack"" people trust.”\n\nFran Strajnar, Co-Founder & CEO, Bravenewcoin.com, also agreed that it will be beneficial for Bitcoin:\n\n“Enterprises, businesses working with either bitcoin or other blockchains, always results in support for bitcoin. If they work with bitcoin - great, more exposure! If they work with another blockchain - that is still a validation towards bitcoin\'s technology and positive towards bitcoin.”\n\nDominik Zynis, founder of a stealth company utilizing blockchain technology said:\n\n“Blue chip technology companies adding blockchain technology into their portfolio of offerings can only serve as validation of Bitcoin. The certification process definitely brings value to CIOs and IT organizations wanting to deploy best in class open source software coupled with the support and professional services that companies like IBM and MSFT have developed.”\n\nWhen asked whether the value of Bitcoin will be affected by the investment of Fortune 500 companies in Blockchain technology, Peter Trcek, the CEO of Bitnik said:', 'Jacek Czarnecki is undertaking an MSc in Law and Finance at the University of Oxford, and is a lawyer specialising in digital currencies, distributed ledgers and financial regulation. He also co-authored the first Polish report on digital currencies as featured on CoinDesk.\n\nIn this article, Czarnecki discusses an overlooked aspect of a recent European Commission proposal concerning the regulation of cryptocurrencies which he says may have far-reaching consequences.\n\nRecently the European Commission (EC) announced plans to apply the EU anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations (the Fourth AML Directive or 4AMLD) to digital currency exchanges and possibly wallet providers.\n\nThis move is a part of the EC’s broadening action against terrorist financing.\n\nBut while this news comes as no surprise, another EC proposal, far less publicized and somewhat overlooked, has the potential to revolutionize the current state of affairs in digital currency regulation in the EU.\n\nHackneyed idea\n\nThe intention to embrace digital currencies by AML/CTF regulations has been expressed many times by the EU institutions – for example, by the European Banking Authority in 2014, and by others after terrorist attacks in Paris in February and November 2015.\n\nIt seems that the latter tragic event finally prompted regulatory action from the Commission\'s side.\n\nIt is interesting that the intended changes (details of which will be revealed in the second quarter of 2016) will be probably made to the 4AMLD, even though it has been adopted as recently as May 2015 and the EU member states still have time to implement the new regulations.\n\nThis was not an unexpected course of events, as many other jurisdictions have either introduced (including the US and Canada) or considered introducing analogous regulations (such as the UK and Australia).\n\nSuch measures have also been recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body that is mainly in charge of setting AML/CTF international standards and assisting in their implementation.\n\nBreakthrough proposal\n\nBesides a plan to extend the scope of the 4AMLD to cover digital currency exchanges, the EC briefly presented another regulatory idea, which was not even mentioned in the press release.\n\nIt seems, however, that its consequences (if implemented) would be far-reaching.\n\nThe EC announced that it will consider applying the licensing and supervision rules of the Payment Services Directive (PSD; a new version of which, 2PSD, has been adopted in 2015) to digital currency exchanges in order to ""promote better control and understanding of the market"".\n\nPSD is one of the cornerstones of the EU single market for payments. It sets out rules for regulated payment services and contains a catalogue of such services.\n\nFirms which render payment services have to comply with many regulations, including licensing and supervision rules, which now the EC apparently also intends to apply to digital currency exchanges.\n\nSuch a plan seems to be sensible. It is clear that there are two legal acts in the EU that would be well-suited for regulating cryptocurrencies: PSD and another related directive, the E-Money Directive (EMD). Works on the new \'3EMD\' are now under way, so some changes could be introduced there as well.\n\nRevising basic assumptions\n\nWhat matters, however, is what the current PSD regulatory methodology looks like.\n\nA crucial piece of the PSD is the definition of ""funds"", which so far has included only cash, bank (scriptural) money and e-money (regulated by the EMD). Cryptocurrencies do not fall into any of those categories – a fact confirmed by the European Central Bank (ECB) and others.\n\nIt follows that, for the EC, digital currency exchanges would be best covered by some provisions of the PSD, although in the current form it does not apply to digital currencies at all.\n\nIt therefore appears that regulatory change might have to be much deeper than merely adding a few provisions extending the scope of licensing and supervision regulations on digital currency exchanges.\n\nNew regulations would probably have to revise some of the basic assumptions and concepts of the PSD, including definitions of ""funds"", ""payment transaction"" or ""payment institution"".\n\nHow should stakeholders react?\n\nIt is difficult to evaluate the EC\'s plan, since at the moment it is extremely general and vague. However, very likely it will open the door for the introduction of cryptocurrencies to the EU payment services regulations.\n\nVarious proposals may emerge afterwards, from cautious and restrained ones to those proposing comprehensive and broad regulation.\n\nFirms that may be affected by any regulatory change should monitor developments closely and be ready to react.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

02/21/2016,"['In an announcement today, the largest bitcoin mining pools and that represent over 70% of the cryptocurrency network’s hashing rate have, in a common consensus with major bitcoin exchanges and service providers, agreed with 90 percent of the Bitcoin Core contributors over the proposed roadmap for scaling bitcoin.\n\nIn an announcement today, members of the Bitcoin Core team and representatives of the cryptocurrency’s mining pools in China have reached an agreement on the roadmap to scaling Bitcoin with a Bitcoin Core approved hard fork. The consensus was achieved at the Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong conference.\n\nThe common consensus will see the proposed timeline have five Bitcoin Core contributors in Cory Fields, Johnson Lau, Luke Dashjr, Matt Corallo and Peter Todd develop the implementation of the hard-fork that will be available as a recommendation to the bitcoin core network.\n\nThis hard-fork will include the feature of a block size increase to around 2 MB and the code is expected to be available in July 2016, within three months of the release of the Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft work.\n\nThe statement read:\n\nThis hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.\n\nSegWit is currently in active development will be released over the next two months as a solution to have more space for transactional data by removing signatures from a transaction, leading to compressed transactions within blocks. The five largest mining pools (Antpool, F2Pool, BTCC Pool, BW.com and Bitfury) were represented at the meeting and have collectively agreed to support SegWit when it is released in April, as per the schedule.\n\n“We will run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core,” the statement added.\n\nBitcoin Core Support\n\nIn a further nod toward sticking with Bitcoin Core, the mining pools, exchanges and service providers make it clear that they will “only run” consensus systems that are compatible with Bitcoin Core which will eventually contain both SegWit and the proposed hard-fork.\n\nLess than two weeks ago, the same mining pools announced that they would not be supporting Bitcoin Classic or any other “contentious hard-fork” that isn’t compatible with Bitcoin Core. The statement came soon after, Bitcoin Classic, an alternative hard fork released code that is looking to raise the maximum block size from 1 MB to 2 MB.\n\nThe Bitcoin Roundtable, a collective of the biggest mining pools, exchanges and service providers also revealed that they are open to technologies that scale and make use of block space more efficiently, pointing to Schnorr multisig as an example.\n\nThe code developed by the volunteering Core team for the hard-fork will be available by July 2016, following SegWit’s expected release in April 2016. The group also backed the implementation of the hard-fork “if there is strong community support” with the activation “likely to happen around July 2017.”\n\nThe complete list of signatories backing the roadmap and the announcement itself can be found here.\n\nImage from Twitter/cnLedger.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin’s dual role as a commodity and a currency can create financial recovery disputes when a company that pays for services using bitcoin goes bankrupt. A bankruptcy court judge made a ruling on Friday in one such case, stating that the cryptocurrency is not the same as U.S. currency, but making it clear that he wanted the ruling confined to a specific legal framework, according to The Recorder, a California legal and technology newspaper.\n\nBankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali in the Northern District of California said Friday that in the case of HashFast Technologies, a mining company that sued to recover bitcoin paid to a physician for his promotional services, that bitcoin is “intangible personal property” and not cash. This distinction allows the company’s bankruptcy trustee to recover the property or its value.\n\nA Test Case On ‘Clawback’ Actions\n\nThe ruling is seen as a test case in how the cryptocurrency should be treated in “clawback” actions, the recovery of disbursed money.\n\nThe judge did not rule on the ownership issue involved in the dispute. He said he will decide later if the doctor has to hand over the bitcoin or its dollar equivalent.\n\nHashFast Technologies filed for bankruptcy in 2014, and its bankruptcy trustee claimed the doctor, Marc Lowe, was overpaid and wanted him to return the payment of 3,000 BTC, now worth $1.3 million in U.S. dollars. They argued bitcoin is a commodity that fluctuates in price. The doctor, in response, argued it’s a currency.\n\nDefense Cites Trustee’s Hypocrisy\n\nDuring Friday’s hearing, Lowe’s lawyer, Brian Klein of Baker Marquart, asked the judge to treat bitcoin as a currency rather than a commodity, thereby reducing about $1 million in value. Klein said HashFast used bitcoin as a currency and a medium of exchange in its business dealings with Lowe and with others. He said it was hypocritical for the trustee to ask for the current value of the BTC the company paid Lowe since it took contrary positions when creditors sought claims that they were owed in bitcoin.\n\nMontali said the bankruptcy code was not written with bitcoin in mind. He said the cryptocurrency is intangible personal property as opposed to cash, a distinction that allows the trustee to recover the property or its value. While HashFast and Lowe may have conducted a deal using bitcoin, “that doesn’t make them dollars,” Montali said.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin — Commodity or currency; California bankruptcy judge to decide\n\nNew Legal Territory Concering Bitcoin\n\nMontali noted he was stepping into new bankruptcy law territory. He emphasized that he was not making pronouncements extending beyond fraudulent transfer laws in the bankruptcy code.\n\nMontali told Aron Oliner of Duane Morris, the attorney representing the HashFast trustee, that if he finds the transfer was valid, he will later decide if Lowe must hand over the bitcoin or its dollar equivalent.\n\nMontali said the cryptocurrency might currently be more widely accepted, but “you try paying your bar ticket with one.”\n\nIn asking that Lowe return the cryptocurrency or its dollar equivalency, Oliner cited decisions by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Internal Revenue Service that virtual currencies are not legal tender even though they can be used to pay for goods and services, CCN reported.\n\nKlein said even if the court decides the doctor has to give the BTC back, bitcoin should be considered a currency. He cited guidance from a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finding that bitcoin is “a kind of electronic money,”; the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; and a Securities and Exchange Commission court argument.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'People always want to get the most out of their bitcoin mining rigs and rightly so. The difficulty levels of bitcoin algorithm are increasing daily and mining has become a competitive affair. Those who discover fresh blocks stand to gain the bitcoin network reward. In order to discover new blocks, the mining chips have to be able to generate enough processing power to break the encryption protocol to find the cryptographic nonce value for the new block. This processing power is supplied by custom built bitcoin mining application specific integrated circuits (ASICs).\n\nThere is always a constant struggle to optimize ASICs to generate more processing power while reducing the electricity consumption. By increasing the efficiency of hardware, bitcoin mining can be made more profitable. Most of the attempts at increasing the processing power are limited to designing better processor architecture. Now for the first time, a group of researchers from the University of Illinois has been involved in a research to improve the bitcoin mining process.\n\nApproximate Bitcoin Mining Increases Miner Efficiency\n\nTheir research involves the implementation of Approximate Bitcoin Mining process to increase the efficiency of mining hardware by up to 30 percent. A team of three researchers – Matthew Vilim, Henrey Duwe, and Rakesh Kumar propose the use of approximate mining circuits that trades of reliability with area and delay. They believe that by operating these circuits in ‘Better than Worst Case’ mode, they can further increase the gains.\n\nIn order to derive this solution, they exploit bitcoin mining’s intrinsic resilience to errors. Bitcoin mining hardware is designed to operate in a parallel fashion to avoid propagation of errors. This enables the circuits to process multiple solutions at the same time without one erroneous output compromising the whole process. Any erroneous solution presented to the Bitcoin network by miners are rejected.\n\nThe researchers have devised two ways of approximation – Functional Approximation and Operational Approximation. In functional approximation, the optimization is carried out by targeting the mining chips functionality. This is done by replacing the exiting circuits with an approximate version in a fashion to reduce the total area occupied by circuit components or delay. This leads to a slack which is recovered by increasing the frequency and throughput.\n\nIn operational approximation, the guard bands in the miner circuit are reduced and frequency is increased by running it with a negative timing slack. According to the paper published by the trio, this is the first time someone has attempted to optimize bitcoin mining by focusing on hardware instead of tweaking the algorithm. The researchers have attempted to reduce the delay by making changes to the adder. By optimizing the usage of mining chip’s real estate with approximation circuit design, manufacturers will be able to place more cores on the chip. This will increase the capability of bitcoin miners to process more hashes.\n\nThe simulations conducted by the researchers using Bitmain BM1385 miner after replacing the parameters has shown promising results with an increase in profitability by 15% to 30%.

His work has appeared in publications such as the New York Times, Gizmodo and Men\'s Health.\n\nBiggs is currently an editor for TechCrunch and the CEO of bitcoin stealth startup Freemit. In this piece, he talks about the challenges of raising funding for bitcoin and blockchain ventures in the current environment.\n\nTo read the many, many excellent (and often elementary) posts about the developing \'uni-pocalyse\', you would assume that VCs have decided to double-up their fleece vests and hole up in Montana.\n\nThis fear is largely untrue, especially when it comes to FinTech funding.\n\nFirst, remember that PayPal launched in a down year. Carry that bit of information like a talisman against the darkness: in slow economic times it\'s the folks who save consumers money or enable small transactions without friction that come away winners. This is important. Help people when they need it most and they will thank you.\n\nSecond, remember that VCs made a lot of goofy bets. Like really goofy. Check out TechCrunch for the past few months and you\'ll find startups that do everything but tie your shoes before you leave the house. Heck, there\'s even an Uber for pumping gas.\n\nBut those goofy bets aren\'t truly contaminating the rest of the markets. Think of this as a reset in the mindsets of big money. The VCs who were patient over the last few years, made strategic bets early and didn’t overpay on multiples are still looking for solid businesses that are investable.\n\nFresh funds are being raised and they need to be invested.\n\nDon\'t panic\n\nThere is one rudimentary concept that we should never ignore: a great business concept plus strong execution equals an investable business. Strong, diligent investors – regardless of the overall funding environment – will always fund those types of businesses.\n\nA solid VC I spoke to said two things were happening – unicorns (which Wikipedia says are companies ""whose valuation has exceeded the somewhat arbitrary value of $1bn"") are finally being accepted as overblown and many investments in AdTech and e-commerce have borne no fruit.\n\nDid you ever have an inkling that a well-funded company that sends boxes of snacks or clever bow ties on a monthly basis wasn\'t really going to set the world on fire? You were probably right.\n\nShould you be panicking? No, but you\'d better start working. I\'m doubling down on Freemit\'s financing efforts right now in San Francisco simply because we are looking for a solid partner with lots of experience in the money-sending space.\n\nWe are looking for solid partners, not just a check.\n\nIf you look at San Francisco VCs as massive, Tesla-driving ATMs you are already sorely mistaken. Some of them spent years at Google making amazing products and now want to try their hand at helping others build.\n\nOthers are young, with little experience, but with a passion that burns through like a brand on the forehead. Some had seen so many ups and downs they are lounging on the deck with a cigar while the waves crash against the bow.\n\nTake a breath, as Brad Feld suggests:\n\n""?While going through my daily reading this morning, I came across a bunch of posts talking about how the sky was falling, Silicon Valley was in turmoil, financing was drying up everywhere, and all the unicorns were doomed.""\n\nWhatever.\n\nHow about a little love from Om Malik?\n\n?""There are many reasons for the present down-in-the-dumps sentiment, though it is clear everyone, down from Goldman Sachs to your Uber driver is just guessing. Is this a seasonal case of the blues or will the trouble last a year? I don’t know and neither does anyone else. The same investors who six months ago were busy droning on about unicorns, are furring their brows.""\n\nAnd how about this from Alex Iskold:\n\n""It seems that seed capital will be more scarce. It seems that it will be harder to raise money from angels and VCs. But maybe not. Because the markets are cooler, there are will be A LOT LESS FOUNDERS starting companies. Anyone who is doing Tinder for this or Uber for that will now think twice or maybe even three times before jumping in. Most like they won’t do it. Less noise will be great for the founders with domain expertise, building businesses with customers and revenue day one. Angels and VCs will likely pay a lot more attention to you if you have something real, and that will an awesome, awesome thing.""\n\nThese guys have been in front of some of the most amazing tech in the world and they know that what really matters is the relentless move forward.\n\nIf we forget this, then we forget the very thing that gets us up in the morning. So let\'s just relax and ease into a different funding environment.\n\nThat said, there are still some things you can do to optimize your experience.\n\nThe first rule of bitcoin is not to talk about bitcoin\n\nBrothers and sisters, this is the era of blockchain!\n\nIf you start saying that bitcoin is a panacea, people will look at you like you\'ve gone full Satoshi. Don\'t let them.\n\nPeople who don\'t understand the space want to invest in this whole ""blockchain"" thing and people who do understand the space have to take the idea of a blockchain-based business to their superiors.\n\nWhy make it hard? I don\'t care if you have pegged your entire business on the white paper – use blockchain and BTC interchangeably. You\'ll have an easier time.\n\nGo after FinTech investors\n\nFind them. Nurture them. Love them.\n\nThe market has long been enamored with easy problems. Uber was, arguably, the last hard problem the Valley had to solve because it was a problem of logistics.\n\nNow that everyone and their dog has figured out how to get a box of groceries from a warehouse to your driveway there isn\'t much innovation. FinTech, on the other hand, is evolving at a clip.\n\nBlockchain and bitcoin are the engines of this growth and you need a partner that understands what you\'re doing.\n\nGo East, young woman\n\nHead to New York and London.\n\nThose are the capital of Fin, whereas SF is the capital of Tech. There aren\'t many active investors there, but if you make the right partnerships you can find some amazingly smart money on Wall Street and in Europe.\n\nChortle all you want, but now is the time to work with bankers, not against them.\n\nStop talking, start doing\n\nOne of the most frustrating experiences as an entrepreneur is the request for traction.\n\nTraction is easy if you\'re shipping dream catchers from Vancouver, but it\'s hard if you\'re trying to create a blockchain-based shipping contract management service for big ships.\n\nIt is a chicken-and-egg problem: you can\'t get VC-fundable traction until you have customers and you can\'t get customers until you get VC-funded traction.\n\nBut what if you got a pro-bono customer and a bunch of letters of intent from others? What if you built a huge waiting list? What if you go into a bank accelerator and got recommendations from the street?\n\nIf you can\'t build traction, you can shore up your future with things that simulate it. Build something that kind of works, then build something better.\n\nWe at Freemit found a wonderful cartoon we always reference.\n\nBuild things that work at every stage. Don\'t plan big and build big pieces. Plan big and build small pieces. Do more with what you have.\n\nIf there is anything impressive about the blockchain space, it’s that it is full of unabashed geniuses. But don\'t let your burning vision block out the reality of development and UX cost.\n\nBonus tip: Hire a designer\n\nI\'ve seen the best companies laid low by short-sighted investors who can\'t see past a bad deck. I know appearances don\'t matter... until they do.\n\nOnce you get in front of an investor, you can dazzle them with your tech bonafides. But you can\'t get through the door if your PowerPoint looks like it was made by my (arguably talented) six-year-old. Hire or befriend a designer. It\'s important.\n\nIn the end, bitcoin and blockchain will win.\n\nWe are living in an era that will be very familiar to some older hackers: this perfectly mirrors the rise of the Internet. Bitcoin is a place full of acrimonious debate; fear, uncertainty and doubt; undercutting and silly feuds. It is a place where big business is ""dipping a toe"" into the blockchain space by making their own private blockchains.\n\nAfter all that worked so well when they tried to build private networks not connected to the Internet back in the mid-1990s.\n\nBack then they didn\'t want their employees hopping on the web to look at cat videos and ignored the primary engine of innovation in the 20th and 21st centuries in the same way they don\'t want the big bad bitcoin to contaminate their pool of traditional, tried-and-tested money moving systems including, but not limited to, ACH, SWIFT and strapping money to a homing pigeon and sending it across borders.\n\nChin up, friends.

""What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked \'systemically important institutions\' and \'too big to fail\' has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people.""\n\nThe crux of the disagreement within the bitcoin community is whether to increase the size of the blocks of data that make up the backbone of bitcoin so that the system could process more transactions at a faster rate. A 1 MB cap on the size of the blocks is hardwired into the bitcoin protocol that was created in 2009.\n\nAllowing fewer transactions per second keeps the system safer, but it limits its overall capacity and, critics say, leads to congestion, transaction delays and cancellations as the network runs out of capacity and gets unreliable.\n\nDuelling bitcoin versions\n\nIn August 2015, Hearn and another senior developer, Gavin Andresen, proposed an alternative version of bitcoin called Bitcoin XT that allows more transactions per second. Since then, other versions have sprung up, including Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nSwitching to Bitcoin XT would require the approval of 75 per cent of the network\'s so-called miners, the superusers who run the computing hardware that generates bitcoin and keeps track of transactions.\n\nSome of those users fear that increasing transaction volume would threaten bitcoin\'s decentralized model and result in only larger, possibly corporate, users being able to afford to mine bitcoins.\n\nBut Hearn and other critics of the existing system allege that control of bitcoin is already centralized. Currently, Hearn says, more than half the processing power is controlled by just two miners in China, which gives them disproportionate control over the bitcoin ecosystem and a disproportionate share of the bitcoin payments that miners get for running the algorithms on which the system operates.\n\nPowerful, expensive hardware is needed in order to generate bitcoins and process transactions. People who own such hardware are called miners and are paid in bitcoin for keeping the protocol running. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\n""At a recent conference, over 95 per cent of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow,"" Hearn wrote.\n\nHe and Andresen set the 75 per cent threshold for switching to the XT system so that the expansion couldn\'t go forward without a large majority and so that a single, large mining pool could not have de facto veto power over expanding the system.\n\nA bitcoin fast lane\n\nIzabella Kaminska, who blogs about bitcoin for the Financial Times, says most miners don\'t support an overall increase in block size but favour a two-tier system that would charge a premium for faster processing of transactions.\n\n""Once the [block size] limit is reached, miners will have to choose which transactions to include and which to dump,"" Kaminska said. ""Naturally, only fees will help guarantee inclusion — something which stands to make the system really expensive really quickly.""\n\nKaminska says those fees could end up being higher than those charged by banks.\n\n\'The most likely outcome will be an evolutionary-style fragmentation ... with both sides turning against each other in a bid to prove they are the better system.\' - Izabella Kaminska, financial blogger\n\n""I don\'t think [Hearn\'s] project (Bitcoin XT) would have helped one bit even if adopted. Hearn wanted to stage an intervention, [but] someone still has to pay for the increased traffic.""\n\nSome say the biggest danger of the current dispute is that it results in two rival systems whose currencies are incompatible, which would destabilize and devalue the currency and undermine the public\'s trust in bitcoin as a legitimate currency. Others, however, think that a so-called fork within the bitcoin network could lead to innovation and, ultimately, strengthen the virtual coin.\n\n""Unlike a real political vote, there is no jurisdiction being fought over,"" said Kaminska. ""Which is why the most likely outcome will be an evolutionary-style fragmentation ... with both sides turning against each other in a bid to prove they are the better system.""\n\nBitcoin might be a virtual currency, but over the past few years, more brick-and-mortar businesses, such as this bar in Sydney, have begun accepting the currency. That trend has reversed somewhat in the past year as bitcoin failed to gain wider appeal and some financial institutions and governments clamped down on the currency. In August 2015, Australian banks closed the accounts of 13 of the country\'s 17 bitcoin exchanges. (David Gray/Reuters)\n\nOn Feb. 11, a group of some of the biggest players in bitcoin issued a statement calling for consensus on the block size issue. The group agreed that the block size needs to increase but argued that it shouldn\'t happen through what it called a ""contentious hard-fork,"" such as XT or Classic, which would split bitcoin into two incompatible systems.\n\n""The deployment of hard-forks without widespread consensus is dangerous and has the potential to cause trust and monetary losses,"" the statement said. ""We strongly encourage all bitcoin contributors to come together and resolve their differences to collaborate on the scaling roadmap.""\n\nExternal threats more dangerous than infighting\n\nHow the rift will play out and what it means for the future of bitcoin is not yet clear. While its value dove more than 16 per cent the day after Hearn announced his departure, the currency has been declared dead many times before.\n\n\'Bitcoin is not static. It will need to be ""reprogrammed"" periodically to survive.\' - Garrick Hileman , economic historian\n\n""Bitcoin\'s most-pressing challenges are external rather than internal,"" said Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the University of Cambridge and the London School of Economics.\n\n""Mike\'s high-profile departure, and the sharp drop in bitcoin\'s price following the announcement, appears to have galvanized the bitcoin community into coming together to resolve, at least temporarily, the block-size debate.""\n\nBut Hileman stressed that the existing ideological differences over bitcoin\'s future direction aren\'t going away and will ""undoubtedly resurface when the next big decision point arises.""\n\n""Bitcoin is not static,"" he said. ""It will need to be \'reprogrammed\' periodically to survive, and it is unrealistic to expect that everyone will always be pleased with how bitcoin evolves.""\n\nTo learn more about bitcoin, listen to ""The Illusion of Money"" on Ideas Feb. 24 and 25, 2016.\n\nThe bitcoin economy\n\nHow the peer-to-peer bitcoin network processes payments\n\nReuters', 'Can real estate mogul and United States presidential contender Donald Trump make bitcoin great again?\n\nA satirical Twitter account called Trumpchain doesn’t quite answer that question, but it does offer an amusing take on the controversial figure\'s bid for the White House.\n\nThe profile, described as a bot “that mixes Donald Trump speeches and tweets with comments from /r/bitcoin”, has undoubtedly become a vehicle for a bizarre mix of comedy and humor as it relates to the bitcoin space.\n\nFrom the block size debate to China’s bitcoin mining ecosystem to Bitcoin Classic and Core, the parody account offers a level of commentary that is at times both crass and eyebrow raising – in good humor, of course.\n\nAmong the topics is China and Iran, which Trump often invokes during his campaign rallies.\n\nWe can\'t let Iran get blockchain technology.

Those who do not agree and say money can’t buy everything, it is time for them to revisit the age-old psychological theory established by Abraham Maslow. The Maslow’s pyramid, also known as Maslow’s hierarchy shows the fundamental needs of humans and how it will contribute towards their self-actualization.\n\n\n\nOne look at the pyramid is all it takes to realize that without money, there is no way one can satisfy any of the needs. The most basic needs – food, clothing and shelter don’t come free either. With money playing an important part in everyone’s life, the monetary systems have become the backbones of human civilization. All the established monetary systems are controlled by the governments and central banks. It means the governments and banks have a say on what one can and cannot do with their life – just by deciding when to turn on/off the tap (flow of money).\n\nGovernments aren’t gods and they are prone to bad decisions resulting from greed, neglect, lack of understanding, oversight or unforeseen circumstances which may prove very costly to individuals. At the same time, they can also target individuals by controlling their finances (tracking expenses, freezing bank accounts etc.). In order to prevent oneself from being easily manipulated, people should also start using alternative financial systems which are not directly connected with the country’s banking and monetary system. Even Tony Robbins, the well-known motivational speaker and personal finance instructor also agrees with it.\n\nThere are currently two ways to invest and safeguard one’s funds. These alternatives to conventional monetary systems are gold and bitcoin. People have been investing in Gold for a long time. going back in history, gold by itself used to be a currency before fiat currency replaced it. Even though Gold is one of the stable precious metals out there, it is still vulnerable to the influence of governments and central banks. There have been cases in history where governments have exerted control over gold by forcing individuals to hand over their gold during the times of depression.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing between gold and bitcoin, bitcoin is the ideal option to invest one’s money in – to park funds or trade and multiply the investment. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency which cuts out middlemen like banks and other financial institutions when it comes to transactions and maintenance of the financial network. Miners, who are individuals or companies around the world collectively contribute processing power to process transactions and maintain the network. They also act as trusted third party, without caring about the user’s personal information. By ensuring virtually no involvement of banks or government interference in operations and transactions over the bitcoin network insulates it from undue government influence and control over an individual’s personal bitcoin finances.\n\nTony Robbins on Bitcoin\n\nTony Robbins maintains a blog where he introduces the readers to financial literacy. Bitcoin prominently features in one of his posts alongside financial advice and financial education material. He understands and also educates people about the differences between bitcoin and other currencies. In the end, Tony Robbins also mentions that the governments can’t devalue bitcoin and it can be used in anywhere in the world in the same form. Bitcoin accounts (or wallets) can’t be frozen by government bodies either.\n\nHowever, governments can still introduce regulations to control bitcoin exchanges and other third party platforms that offer bitcoin-based services.\n\nBitcoin is the future of the economy. Governments and central banks are already considering ways to implement bitcoin technology into conventional monetary systems to iron out some of the inherent flaws. Bitcoin has paved the way for all around upgradation of banking and financial sector across the world.\n\nRef: Gold Reserve Act (1934) | What you need to know about Bitcoin - Tony Robbins | Img: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs by FireflySixtySeven (CC BY-SA 4.0) - Wikipedia Disclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC."", 'Popular bitcoin wallet platform and vault storage service provider Xapo has announced their plans to embrace Bitcoin Classic, a Bitcoin block size increase proposal by 2 megabytes.\n\nOn February 21, 2016, popular bitcoin wallet platform and vault solutions provider Xapo CEO Wences Casares announced that the company is planning to upgrade to Bitcoin Classic, with a vision to help the Bitcoin network scale efficiently.\n\nXapo is planning to upgrade to Classic. We’re committed to helping bitcoin scale and to supporting the initiatives that can take us there. — Wences Casares (@wences) February 20, 2016\n\nBitcoin Classic is a hard fork bitcoin block size increase proposal currently supported and led by Bitcoin Core developers Gavin Andressen and Jeff Garzik, and industry leaders including Coinbase and Circle. If Bitcoin Classic achieves the 75% support threshold and becomes successfully implemented, the Bitcoin block size will be increased to 2 megabytes immediately, hence the name hard fork.\n\nHowever, the announcement of Xapo has become controversial amongst the community and existing Xapo users, because the implementation of Bitcoin Classic could lead to a split chain, an event in which two Bitcoin chains co-exist in the same network. Historically, if two Bitcoin chains co-exist in the same network, the minority becomes eliminated almost instantly, unifying to one single chain. Thus, if Bitcoin Classic overtakes the Core chain, the Bitcoin network would be unified to the Classic chain that is controlled and maintained by another team of developers with a separate vision.\n\nBecause of this possibility, Xapo users have begun to call the move of Xapo a “anti-Bitcoin camp,” as in theory, eliminates the existing Bitcoin chain and creates a separate coin developed by a separate entity.\n\n@wences Sad to see Xapo moving into anti-Bitcoin camp organized by Coinbase and Circle. Time to shut down my Xapo account, it seems. — Bitcoin: ?ce ??????? (@bit_novosti) February 20, 2016\n\nXapo users have also begun to question the motivation and intent behind Xapo’s decision to support Bitcoin Classic and overall scaling of the Bitcoin network considering their absence in various scaling conferences and round tables held in Hong Kong and Montreal during the past few months.\n\n@wences If you’re so “committed” to helping scale. Where was @xapo in Montreal, Hong Kong, and other “scaling” meetings? Pfft. — Chakra (@chakrascientist) February 21, 2016\n\nStill, many bitcoin enthusiasts in the community are praising Xapo’s attempt to help the scaling of the Bitcoin network and initiatives led by leading companies such as Coinbase and Circle.\n\n@wences Awesome to see Xapo continues to deeply understand bitcoin as ideal-money, with low-friction & adoption network-effect being key.\n\n— Dan McArdle (@robustus) February 21, 2016', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

02/22/2016,"['Brian Armstrong, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin wallet and exchange service Coinbase, has spoken out against the latest proposal introduced as part of bitcoin\'s ongoing scaling debate, calling the agreed-upon measures, ""too little, too late"".\n\nAt the end of last week, a group of representatives from the bitcoin mining and services sector, as well as Bitcoin Core developers, agreed to a plan that involved support for a proposed change to bitcoin\'s code called Segregated Witness, followed by a network hard fork – which would require users to download new software to stay compatible with the network – in 2017.\n\nIn total, the changes could raise the capacity of transaction blocks on the bitcoin network to as high as 4MB, proponents say, though this would happen over a period of months.\n\nIn a new blog post, however, Armstrong argued the proposal is ""missing the mark"", stating his belief that the Segregated Witness proposal ""is not a good solution to help bitcoin scale"" as it overstates the capacity increase it would bring to the network.\n\nArmstrong wrote:\n\n""If the plan is followed as written, SegWit would provide a slightly less than doubling of capacity by April 2016. Then we would go another 15 months (until July 2017) without any additional capacity increase. If bitcoin transactions per day continue to more then double annually, as they have been for the past few years, we will be in a worse position than we are today in the first half of 2017. This feels like a major oversight of the proposal.""\n\nWith the remarks, Armstrong has emerged as the highest-profile critic of the new proposal, a group that also includes Xapo CEO Wences Casares.\n\nAnnounced this weekend, the 2017 hard fork proposal saw a broad array of industry participants aligning around a roadmap that aims to bring together two opposing sides in the long-running block size debate.\n\nCall for action\n\nOverall, Armstrong proposes that a better solution for the scaling issue already exists in the form of the alternative proposal Bitcoin Classic, which would immediately increase the cap on the size of data blocks to 2MB, up from 1MB today.\n\nOf note, is that the Coinbase CEO questioned the politics involved in the latest agreement, saying that ""it perpetuates a centralized, single party system, in bitcoin"".\n\nRather than a single group deciding on bitcoin\'s future, ""bitcoin would be better off with a multi-party system, where several teams compete to add features to the protocol"". This would allow the industry to ""vote"" on which system to adopt, he suggests.\n\nHe further critiqued the latest agreement as merely ""a series of words"", adding that there is no guarantee that they will be upheld by signatories.\n\nIn the end, Armstrong calls for bitcoin miners and business owners to upgrade to Classic, saying it will bring ""immediate relief to bitcoin’s scaling problem and help restore confidence in the system"".\n\nIf implemented, Classic would trigger initial block size increase to 2MB. This activation is contingent on 75% of the past 1,000 bitcoin transaction blocks being mined with the new code.\n\nOnce that happens, the changes would kick in after a 30-day waiting period.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.\n\nToy soliders via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His 2014 book, Mastering Bitcoin, was called the “best technical reference available on bitcoin today,” by Balaji Srinivasan, the CEO of 21.co, and received high praise from Gavin Andresen, Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nIn January 2016, Institute for the Future launched Blockchain Futures Lab, a research initiative and a community for “identifying the opportunities and limits of blockchain technologies and their social, economic, and political impacts on individuals, organizations, and communities over the coming decades.” I'm working with IFTF on Blockchain Futures Lab, and I interviewed Antonopoulos to get his thoughts on the current state of blockchain technology and where it’s headed. You can read the full interview on Medium.\n\nYou cannot create global finance and economic inclusion on the back of a carefully controlled show-us-your-papers identity-based system where everything is tracked. What you create is a global surveillance dystopia. Our entire financial system is heading into this thing where everything is surveilled. Bitcoin is heading in exact opposite direction. No identity by default, from weak pseudonymity to a stronger and stronger anonymity as time goes by. As a result, it doesn’t do borders. It doesn’t care about borders. It doesn’t do Know Your Customer. It doesn’t do Anti-Money Laundering. It doesn’t do those things because those things are bourgeois concepts of the privileged financial elite. Those bourgeois concepts have a four-billion-people-in-poverty price tag.\n\nHere's the audio of the interview:\n\nYou can also subscribe to Institute for the Future's Blockchain Futures Lab on iTunes or RSS."", 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'Peter Sands, the former chief executive of British multinational and financial services company Standard Chartered, states that central banks must terminate the issuance of £50, $100 and €500 bills to reduce the circulation of fraudulent transactions.\n\nSands’ new report titled “Making it Harder for the Bad Guys: The Case for Eliminating High Denomination Notes”, published by Harvard Kennedy School, proposes the central bank eliminate high value currency notes to reduce illegal money flows, tax evasion and financial fraud.\n\n“Our proposal is to eliminate high denomination, high value currency notes, such as the €500 note, the $100 bill, the CHF1,000 note and the £50 note. Such notes are the preferred payment mechanism of those pursuing illicit activities, given the anonymity and lack of transaction record they offer, and the relative ease with which they can be transported and moved. By eliminating high denomination, high value notes we would make life harder for those pursuing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance and corruption.” – Peter Sands\n\nThe report states that illegal money flows exceed $2 trillion annually, with the majority of the transactions deriving from the purchases of illicit goods such as drugs and weapons. Sands further emphasizes that high value currencies play a minimal role in the functioning of an economy, yet a significant role in the underground economy.\n\nGlobal Financial Integrity (GFI), which produces high-caliber analyses of illicit financial flows and advises developing country governments on effective policy solutions, estimates that in 2013, illicit financial flows from developing countries totaled $1.1 trillion, recording a staggering, 275 percent increase since early 2004.\n\nWhile GFI and Sands estimate that trillions of U.S. dollars are spent by terrorist groups, corrupt politicians and banks to smuggle cash through borders, they believe that electronic payment mechanisms such as Bitcoin are more efficiently used to settle transactions.\n\n“In the underground economy, the reverse is true. High denomination notes are the payment instrument of choice for those evading taxes, committing crimes, financing terrorism or giving or receiving bribes. Cash offers anonymity, leaves no transaction record and is universally accepted. High denomination notes are the form of cash which enable large sums to be paid, moved and stored with minimum cost and detection risk. From the criminals’ perspective, high denomination notes are far more attractive than bank transactions, Bitcoin, gold or diamonds.” – Peter Sands\n\nAs demonstrated by the graph provided by Sands above, cash, diamonds and gold are the only truly anonymous forms of money in existence today. Because of the lack of mobility in gold and diamonds, cash has been the highly preferred method of payment over the last few decades. Because of its low transaction cost, immediacy of value transfer, complete anonymity and untraceability, nearly $1 trillion worth of fiat money is used by corrupt politicians and financial organizations annually.\n\nEvery year, the World Bank Group’s Enterprise Surveys conducts an international survey with more than 130,000 firms across 135 countries, to evaluate and establish the level of corruption and bribery involved with governments and federal agencies. According to their newly released corruption data, around 17.2 percent of companies and organizations around the world have experienced at least one bribe payment request in recent years. Moreover, Enterprise Surveys stated that the around 26.1 percent of the companies were required to bribe government officials or agencies to secure contracts.\n\nSands explains that the elimination of high value currencies and the implementation of popular electronic payment mechanisms, such as Bitcoin, could significantly reduce bribery and government corruption worldwide.\n\nSince some extremely high denomination notes have been eliminated in recent years, such as Canada’s $1,000 notes and Singapore’s $10,000 note, Sands believes that his proposal is reasonable, considering the rising levels of financial fraud and money laundering.\n\n“Electronic payment mechanisms continue to become more available, accepted, flexible and cost-effective. Since most people in most countries already use such alternatives rather than high denomination notes when they make high value payments, they clearly work. Given these technological advances, high denomination notes are no longer required to facilitate the smooth functioning of the legitimate economy.” – Peter Sands\n\nSince most currencies, such as the euro, have several high denomination notes including the €500, €200 and €100 note, Sands and his team of researchers are proposing the governing body eliminate the highest note first, observe the effect, and remove the others from the financial system over the next few years.\n\nAs large currency notes become eliminated, both commercial and central banks would lose some seignorage income and thus, leading financial organizations and banking groups will most probably reject Sands’ proposal.\n\nSeignorage income is the revenue for a government when the money that is created is worth more than it costs to produce it. However, some financial experts worry that implementing the elimination of high value currency notes to reduce the number of payments related to crimes and fraudulent activities may lead banking institutions and financial establishments to become even more corrupt, as they would seize the power to process and settle fraudulent transactions for corrupt organizations and individuals without any evidence to trace the transactions.\n\nPhoto 401kcalculator.org / Flickr(CC)', 'LT, February 22, 2016 at 18:03 UTC\n\nLondon, February 22, 2016. UK Bitcoin service provider SpectroCoin.com last month introduced multi-currency wallets for its clients, so now they can choose among of a number of currencies such as EUR, USD, GBP, CHF, CZK, PLN, NOK to name but a few as their base currency in SpectroCoin.com wallet. In addition, to this company has also released virtual and physical debit cards denominated in USD and GBP in addition to ones denominated in EUR.\n\nOne of they key benefits of these cards is the low cost as the virtual card costs only 0.5 USD and debit card costs only 9 USD, which is the lowest offering in the market. The deposit to the card is instantaneous and at the favorable exchange rate.\n\nAlso, a multicurrency option is available for merchant clients, so now payments received in bitcoin by SpectroCoin clients can be settled not only in EUR but also USD, GBP, CHF, CZK, PLN, NOK and a number of other currencies.\n\nTo promote this new card offering, SpectroCoin.com is sponsoring an online questionnaire, which is going to be used as a part of an academic study to investigate the impact of news on Bitcoin price. The questionnaire is used to build a sentiment dictionary to indicate how different words in bitcoin context are perceived by the community. This research is conducted by researchers at Leuven Institute for Research on Information systems.\n\nMost importantly due to sponsorship by SpectroCoin.com every respondent who provides email will receive a free virtual bitcoin debit card from SpectroCoin.com. Cards will be distributed at the beginning of March.\n\nThe questionnaire can be found at http://poll.spectrocoin.com.\n\nhttps://spectrocoin.com\n\nThe publication of a press release on this page should not be viewed as an endorsement by CoinDesk.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'A US district judge has ruled, for the purposes of a bankruptcy case in California, that bitcoins are a kind of intangible property.\n\nAs reported earlier this month by CoinDesk, the US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California is hearing a case filed by the bankruptcy trustee for HashFast, a bitcoin mining firm that declared bankruptcy in 2014.\n\nThe trustee is suing a former promoter for HashFast, Mark Lowe, and is seeking the return of 3,000 bitcoins alleged to have been fraudulently transferred to Lowe prior to the firm\'s collapse.\n\nIn recent weeks, both sides have submitted arguments over whether bitcoin should be considered a currency or a commodity for the purposes of the case.\n\nAt stake is roughly $1m in value. If bitcoin is deemed a currency, then Lowe would only have to return the 3,000 BTC at the value they held when he received them, which amounts to about $360,000. If deemed a commodity, then the appreciated value of that 3,000 BTC – about $1.3m today – is up for grabs.\n\nDuring a hearing on 19th February, US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali sided with the trustee, declaring that bitcoin is an ""intangible personal property"" rather than a currency.\n\nLawyer Brian Klein of law firm Baker Marquart, one of the attorneys representing Lowe, pushed for the court to pay attention to how the bitcoins were treated when Lowe was being paid for promoting HashFast\'s products – in this case, bitcoins were being treated as the same as dollars at the time.\n\nYet, Montali disputed that notion, stating that bitcoins and dollars are not the same, saying:\n\n""But that doesn\'t make [bitcoins] dollars, that’s my point. I understand how the parties acted, but that doesn\'t make them dollars.""\n\nThe matter up for discussion wasn\'t entirely settled, as Montali indicated that he would, for now, only weigh in on the currency vs commodity angle.\n\nMontali said that he would return to the question of whether, if required, Lowe would transfer the 3,000 bitcoins or the equivalent dollar amount.\n\nThe judge indicated that he would issue an order on the decision, which at press time is currently unavailable.\n\nLimited impact\n\nAs noted by industry experts, the ruling will add to relevant case law concerning the question of how bitcoin should be treated in civil legal cases, though it is likely to have few larger ramifications.\n\nFor example, while US agencies like the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have ruled bitcoin should be treated as a commodity, other federal agencies are likely to rule differently as they seek to define the technology under their mandates.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for instance, has been encouraged by blockchain advocacy group Coin Center to consider how some uses for bitcoin may meet its definition for security, while others may not.\n\nOther US regulatory bodies may come to similar conclusions, suggesting there may be no one definition for how bitcoin ultimately falls under US law.\n\nThis article has been updated for clarity.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This would be a first, if implemented on a system-wide basis.\n\nBlockchain Technology Beyond Bitcoin and Finance\n\nSony GE notes that blockchain is most popularly known as the technology that powers bitcoin and also references the growing number of bitcoin exchange platforms as a testament to the potential of the technology.\n\nThe Japanese company claims blockchain holds promise for applications beyond the realm of finance with secure properties that enable participants to freely and securely share information without the need for an established trust between the relevant parties.\n\nWith the advent of its newly developed technology, Sony GE believes that new educational services will come to the fore in the future. This will stem from the diversification of the ways in which tests are designed and individuals are evaluated by different organizations, the company explains.\n\nWith this infrastructure in place, each evaluating organization sent an individual’s testing records could assess those results and calculate a score in a way that fits its own methods.\n\nSony also hopes to bring credibility to its open-yet secure educational infrastructure platform by drawing in educational institutions to participate and adopt the technology.\n\nAlthough no further details have been revealed of the prototype technology, Sony GE revealed that its “new educational infrastructure” will see the light of day in 2017. The blockchain-based technology will be initiated within the company’s own existing programs while pushing for wider adoption afterwards. The first program that will see the utilization of the new blockchain-based educational infrastructure will be Sony GE’s Global Math Challenge, a competition that has attracted over 150,000 participants in over 80 countries around the world.\n\nServing as a pilot program for the new blockchain technology, the competition will make for a good testing ground for the technology as it calculates a candidate’s overall test taking performance, beyond correct and incorrect responses. In this regard, evaluating organizations looking at parameters such as time taken to answer questions and more can find the blockchain-based innovation to be useful.\n\nSony Global Education was established in April 2015 after Sony Corporation and Sony Computer Science Laboratories announced plans for a new company that will offer educational services in Japan and a number of other countries around the world.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""How To Buy And Sell Bitcoin Under The Age of 18\n\nHow To Buy And Sell Bitcoin Under The Age of 18\n\nAbout The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

02/23/2016,"['UPDATE (24th February 3:35am BST): This piece has been updated with comment from Japan\'s Financial Services Agency.\n\nRegulators in Japan have reportedly proposed treating digital currencies like bitcoin as methods of payment, a distinction that would make them legally equivalent to conventional currencies in the country.\n\nAccording to a report by Nikkei, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering whether to make revisions to legislation that would classify digital currencies as ""fulfilling the functions of currency"".\n\n""They are now recognized as objects but are not treated on a par with their more established counterparts,"" the report states, adding:\n\n""Under the FSA\'s proposed definition, virtual currencies must serve as a medium of exchange, meaning that they can be used to purchase goods and services. They must also be exchangeable for legal tender through purchases or trades with an unspecified partner.""\n\nAs a result of the change, financial institutions would need to register with the FSA, a policy regulators believe could help prevent a scenario similar to the collapse of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, which lost millions in consumer funds to insolvency in 2014.\n\nThe news comes amid a broader conversation ongoing in Japan over how digital currency exchanges should be regulated under know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) statutes.\n\nNikkei adds that the proposed changes are expected to be submitted during the current legislative session of the Diet, Japan\'s legislature, which runs from 4th January to 1st June, with any changes being approved before the session concludes.\n\nDespite the article, the FSA told CoinDesk that ""nothing has been decided yet"" and that it has yet to take any official action on the treatment of digital currency.\n\nStock market image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Many alt-coins are pre-mined, causing them to lose much of their legitimacy. If a coin has been pre-mined, it should automatically be crossed off your digital currency investment list.\n\nFurther, many quite simply don’t have the adoption rate to offer any sort of liquidity or security. Still, amateur alt-coins are part of the space, and there are more all the time. They’re also a point of contention for many critics of crypto-currency generally, who point towards how easy it is to create a crypto-currency these days. Of course, it wasn’t so easy until Bitcoin demonstrated the model.\n\nFrom the years 2013-2015, the three largest cryptocurrencies have remained steady: they are, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin, respectively.\n\nBitcoin is well-publicized, but other options not so much.\n\nA major switch happened in 2014 as Ripple overtook Litecoin for second largest alt-coin in the market. As of December 2015, Ripple stands at a market cap of $211,089,007. Litecoin’s is $151,006, 662. Bitcoin’s is $6,596, 631,791.\n\nBelow these top three spots, there is a lot of turnover. The steady options over the past two years have been Dogecoin, Bitshares, Stellar and Maidsafe coin below the top three alt-coins.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nThe most publicized of the Bitcoin 2.0 technologies, Ethereum has had an appreciable price increase YTD perhaps thanks to questions surrounding the block size limit in Bitcoin and rendering it the second largest alternative digital currency.\n\nThe currency raised nearly $20 million in order to ensure the project would get off the ground, and many people believe that Ethereum can achieve what Bitcoin cannot.\n\n3. Ripple\n\nRipple is different than Litecoin and Bitcoin. For one, its pre-mined, meaning its not a very good option for an investor, not to mention its lost more than 90% of its market cap over the past two years.\n\nRipple considers itself a “real-time gross settlement system”, and functions as a currency exchange and remittance network run by a private company, Ripple. The Ripple Protocol is a distributed open-source protocol with its own currency, called XRP or ripples. It’s likely that Ripple has served as a source of inspiration for many of the private financial institutions looking into Bitcoin.\n\nIn recent years, Ripple has turned its focus away from the crypto-currency movement to focus on the banking market perhaps symbolic of the synergy between the financial industry and the Ripple model. Indeed, American Banker once wrote that “from [a] banks’ perspective, distributed ledgers like the Ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.”\n\n4. Litecoin\n\nLitecoin is the well-known crypto-currency designed by Charles Lee, who now works as Director of Engineering at Coinbase. This peer-to-peer internet currency is very much like Bitcoin from the user standpoint.\n\nOpen-source and global, Litecoin, like Bitcoin, is also fully decentralized, with mathematics securing the network. Some people point to Litecoin’s faster transaction times as an improvement over Bitcoin.\n\nLitecoin is one of the most proven crypto-currency experiments on the market and its proof-of-work algorithm uses scrypt, a different form of encryption, than Bitcoin. Charlie Lee envisaged the system as silver to Bitcoin’s gold analogy. He also foresaw that there might be a time when the Bitcoin network could not handle itself as a transaction network after a certain volume, and believed Litecoin could handle the spillover if Bitcoin every reached capacity.\n\nIn summation\n\nI’m no expert on trading cryptocurrencies, as some are, but, unless you’re an expert, it’s probably best to stay focused on Bitcoin. Until one feels comfortable about the nuances of each crypto-currency, there’s no reason to explore other options, although Litecoin could be a smart, inexpensive speculative play, just don’t invest more than you’re ready to lose. Once one does, even then, that doesn’t mean Litecoin and Ripple – or any other options – are a good choice for you.\n\nImages from Shutterstock, Ethereum, Ripple.

Customers can use bitcoin to pay for utilities, home and property rent, school fees, credit card payments and insurance premiums.\n\nNow, the payments company has announced a loyalty program which will reap rewards for Australians who choose to make their payments in bitcoin.\n\nThe rewards include the likes of Apple TVs, PlayStation 4 consoles, Fitbit wristbands and even Australian dollars in denominations of $50 and $100 that can be redeemed for points accumulated through the loyalty program.\n\nCEO and co-founder of Living Room of Satoshi, Daniel Alexiuc, sees the rewards program as a novel way to spread bitcoin awareness in the country. Furthermore, users who have been using the company’s services over the past six months will also be rewarded with points retrospectively. Alexiuc stated:\n\nWe want to promote bitcoin as an easy, fun and useful payment option for everyday bills. Now you can be rewarded for being part of the ecosystem.\n\nSpeaking to CCN, Alexiuc revealed insights about bitcoin and blockchain adoption in Australia, as well as the progress being made by Living Room Of Satoshi as a bitcoin-friendly, blockchain-based company.\n\nHow is Bitcoin adoption faring in Australia?\n\nConsumer use is growing steadily. However business and commercial use is being stifled by a poor decision from the Australia Taxation Office (who I incidentally used to write software for) to classify bitcoin as a commodity, not a currency.\n\nThe resulting double GST that applies makes bitcoin a very difficult option for business.\n\nHow has Living Room of Satoshi grown in the past 2 years?\n\nWe’ll be coming up to 2 years in operation in April. We won a banking industry “startup showdown” in 2014, we were involved in the ATO’s senate inquiry into bitcoin, we won “Best new startup in Australia“.\n\nin 2015, we launched a “pay anyone” feature last year, and just announced our rewards program. We’ve got lots of exciting things planned for 2016!\n\nCould you share figures of the user growth/stats?\n\nIn its relatively short time of operation, Living Room of Satoshi has processed over 2,500 bills for Australians, and a total of over $1.1 million AUD. Bill payments have increased by 50% in just the last 6 months, and continue to grow each week. The most common bill payments are paying off credit cards, phone bills, rental payments and electricity/gas bills.\n\nDoes your company take a fee for payments made through your portal with Bitcoin?\n\nThere are no fees or charges. If you type a dollar amount into our homepage, you’ll see an instant bitcoin conversion price which is the total and only amount you pay.\n\nHow are you able to provide rewards?\n\nWe make profit by selling bitcoin on multiple international exchanges, being able to achieve a better price than is possible locally in Australia. We share some of that as rewards with our loyal customers, which provides a small and fun extra incentive to pay with bitcoin.\n\nWhat do you make of the ASX being the first stock exchange in the world to actively embrace blockchain technology?\n\nAs someone who has written software for banks, markets and payments companies in the past, I’m extremely excited that Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation is beginning to transform the way finance and settlement companies operate.\n\nI believe that the “blockchain” solutions they come up with will not use a chain of blocks, as such a data structure only makes sense when used in a trustless decentralised environment like Bitcoin, and I don’t think they are ready to give up that level of control yet.\n\nBut it’s clear that Nakamoto’s revolutionary technology has inspired CTO’s to look at their own systems and realise that their systems are well overdue for overhaul, and should be operating much closer to realtime.\n\nWould you like to reveal or say about your company or Bitcoin in general?\n\nI’d like to say something to Chris Jordan if he’s reading, the current Commissioner of Taxation for the Australian Taxation Office: Please reconsider your classification and treatment of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is here, and clearly not going away.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Today marks the official release of Bitcoin Core 0.12.0, the twelfth generation of Bitcoin's reference client as first launched by Satoshi Nakamoto seven years ago. Developed by close to 100 contributors over seven months, the latest version of Bitcoin Core includes more than 20 improvements, particularly regarding performance, security and usability.\n\nThese are the sixth most notable changes.\n\nMemory Pool Limiting\n\nMemory pools are the collections of unconfirmed transactions as stored individually by all full nodes. Memory pools fill up in between blocks as new transactions are transmitted over the Bitcoin network and are depleted when these transactions are included in blocks. But if a series of subsequent blocks remain full for an extended period – either due to legitimate transactions or spam attacks – memory pools might not deplete completely, and backlogs could build up. With no maximum limit, the backlog might even grow to the point where nodes run out of memory and crash. (This is the “crash landing” scenario former Bitcoin XT lead developer Mike Hearn feared.)\n\nMemory pool limiting, as the name suggests, enforces a hard limit on the maximum size of memory pools to prevent this scenario. If the maximum is reached, nodes reject or clear their memory pools of transactions that offer the lowest amount of fees per byte.\n\nFull node operators can configure their limits, but the default maximum size in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 is set on 300 megabytes.\n\nBlockchain Pruning for Wallet Users\n\nOne of the burdens of running a full node is the requirement to store the complete blockchain. This adds up to 55 gigabytes at the time of this writing, and can grow another 50 gigabytes per year under the current 1-megabyte block size limit.\n\nTo decrease this requirement, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 allows users to prune the blockchain, which means they can get rid of older data once their node has verified it. The amount of data to keep is configurable, though Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 will still require a minimum 2 gigabytes of disk space.\n\nPruning the blockchain does mean these nodes will no longer be able to share all the blockchain data with peers, such as full nodes syncing with the network for the first time.\n\n(It should be noted that pruning the blockchain was first introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.11.0, but was not yet available for users running Bitcoin Core as a wallet.)\n\nUpload Traffic Limiting\n\nFull nodes continually transmit and relay transactions and blocks to each other over Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network. This typically requires a modest amount of data to be downloaded, but sharing that same data with several peers at the same time can add up to significant upload costs.\n\nBitcoin Core 0.12.0 introduces a configurable data cap for upload traffic. If this cap comes within reach, the node will seize uploading blocks older than a week, typically requested by nodes first syncing with the network. Additionally, any light clients will be disconnected and no longer served any block data.\n\nOpt-in Replace-by-fee\n\nAs the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network increases, not all transactions might fit into blocks. As such, miners will probably pick the transactions sent by users who included most fees. This means that some transactions – from users that paid too low a fee – could never confirm at all. And since many full nodes and miners currently reject conflicting transactions (sent from the same inputs as an earlier transaction), low fee transactions can get “stuck” on the network.\n\nTo solve this, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 introduces opt-in replace-by-fee. If a transaction is sent using opt-in replace-by-fee, users can replace their own transaction with a newer transaction by including a higher fee. (This also means that miners can increase their income, as they get to pick transactions that include higher fees.)\n\nThe “opt-in” part of opt-in replace-by-fee means these types of transactions will not be the default, and will be flagged as replace-by-fee transactions on the Bitcoin network. Anyone relying on zero-confirmation transactions should want to monitor for these replace-by-fee transactions, as these could very easily be reverted until they are confirmed. (Of course, zero-confirmation transactions were never secure.)\n\nWhether opt-in replace-by-fee will actually be useful depends on Bitcoin miners; they ultimately decide which transactions to include in blocks, and under what policies.\n\nTor by Default\n\nWhile Bitcoin is often claimed to provide anonymity to users, this is not entirely true. Bitcoin users can be de-anonymized, for example, through the peer-to-peer network. If it is determined from which IP-address a transaction originated, this information can be used to identify Bitcoin users.\n\nTo protect users' privacy, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 automatically connects to the Bitcoin network through anonymizing tool Tor (The Onion Router) – if Tor is installed on the same computer. Tor encrypts data and routes it through several nodes all across the world before broadcasting it. This makes it hard – perhaps impossible – to trace where a Bitcoin transaction originated.\n\n(It should be noted that using Tor in itself might not be sufficient to protect a Bitcoin user’s identity. See Bitcoin Magazine's Beginners Guide to Bitcoin Privacy for more information.)\n\nFaster Signature Validation\n\nSignatures are the cryptographic trick where private keys are “combined” with any other data to calculate a unique string of numbers. Corresponding public keys can be used to verify that the signatures were created using the private keys. In Bitcoin's case, signatures are effectively used to prove ownership of bitcoin, and, as such, to validate transactions.\n\nBut there are several ways to conduct this cryptographic trick, which could result in different signatures – all valid in their own way. And if different Bitcoin nodes apply different methods for validation, some nodes might consider certain transactions valid while other nodes do not, which could split the Bitcoin network.\n\nFollowing up on a soft fork to solve this problem last year, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 now switches all validation from the “OpenSSL” cryptographic library to “libsecp256k1”, developed by Dr. Pieter Wuille, Gregory Maxwell and other Bitcoin Core developers.\n\nAs an added benefit, this new signature validation scheme requires less CPU-power, lowering the cost of running a full node and significantly decreasing block validation time.\n\nFor a full list of improvements, see Bitcoin Core 0.12.0's release notes on GitHub.\n\nThanks to Bitcoin Core lead developer Wladimir van der Laan, and Ciphrex CEO and Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo for proofreading and added feedback."", 'Kansas Medicaid backlog hits nursing homes financially\n\nFewer Kansas nursing homes are willing to take new residents whose Medicaid applications are pending because of how long it’s taking to get applications processed and get payments flowing.', 'One of the biggest, still-dormant use cases for blockchain technology is in the field of media – the overarching term capturing a slew of creative professions whose traditional business models have been upended by lightning-fast digital file replication.\n\nAcross various fields, the problems are clear: writers, photographers and musicians lack the ability to prove and protect ownership of their works and ideas, a prospect that renders monetization in a digital environment difficult.\n\nIn the face of this challenge, blockchain tech, with its ability to provide provenance, identity and micropayments has emerged as a potential antidote.\n\nOne of the more unique projects innovating in this area is Mediachain, a newly launched metadata protocol that allows digital creators to attach information to their creative works, timestamp that data to the bitcoin blockchain and store it with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a distributed file system incorporating aspects of blockchain technology.\n\nTo Jesse Walden and Denis Nazarov, co-founders of Mine, the startup behind the Mediachain project, entrepreneurial innovators approaching the space have too often tried to undo how the Internet has changed media business models, rather than help those affected work more effectively within the parameters of this new reality.\n\nAs an example of its thesis, Mediachain is beginning its work by focusing on image data and attribution, using machine learning and blockchain tech to offer a service whereby users can not only attach identifying information to files, but reverse query files to search for creators.\n\nAt launch, the focus of the project will be on pictorial works, as Nazarov told CoinDesk:\n\n""With drag and drop and copy and paste, images are the easiest media type to share on the Internet. Images travel virally, but it’s hard for the creators and content owners to benefit. We really see Mediachain as a global rights database for images.""\n\nWhen used in conjunction with a service like Instagram, Nazarov and Walden envision a future where users who wanted to repost an image would be able to pull up historic information on the file using Mediachain.\n\nIn this light, they see the effort as a way to help preserve identity, even if enforcing the rights and monetizing such content may be, in their own words, ""an impossible problem"".\n\nOn a sufficiantly long timeline, such a reliable metadata database could enable the creation of new platforms, Walden and Nazarov contend, such as a next-generation Spotify or Netflix, which would be able to easily access identifying information for creative works.\n\n""The goal of Mediachain is to unbundle identity and distribution. We’re the identity layer on which distribution platforms can be built,"" Walden said.\n\nLessons from the past\n\nWalden and Nazarov have also identified what they believe to be a viable point of attack in order for the Mediachain platform to gain wider use – public institutions that offer open data sets for images used in galleries, libraries and archives.\n\n“Part of their public mandate is to have openly licensed metadata about their works. The Metropolitan Museum of Art might have its own metadata platform, it might have an API and there’s lots of interesting projects being built on top of them,” Nazarov said.\n\nIn particular, he cited efforts by the New York Public Library to make maps with its historical images available to the public. The co-founders said that by focusing on this group, they could help bootstrap the effort as they seek to encourage the platform’s wider use in consumer-facing projects.\n\nIn initial blog posts, Mine has provided details as to its choice of architecture for the platform, and why it believes IPFS was the best option for the database when compared to alternatives such as the bitcoin blockchain or even a newly created blockchain.\n\nMine has cited IPFS’ ability to store ""richly structured data"" in what they contend is a more readable format than alternatives. This was of interest, Walden said, because Mediachain features only descriptions of media, not the actual files themselves.\n\nStill, Walden argued that the decentralized nature of Mediachain is crucial to its efforts given the past failures of the Global Repertoire Database (GRD), one of the more high-profile, high-investment attempts to create a database of musical rights and works.\n\nLaunched in 2008, the effort saw stakeholders from across the tech and recording industries come together to invest €23m-€32m in a digital rights management system, only to have the GRD fall apart amid missed deadlines and fights over funding.\n\nWalden said that the lesson from the effort is that a centralized solution is not best equipped to handle the storage of digital rights, adding:\n\n""The goal of that project is similar to our goal, but our belief is that a GRD will need to be decentralized.""\n\nBuilding trust\n\nGiven its design, however, Mediachain has had to adapt to future challenges even before its launch, for example, how it might deal with bad actors who want to claim ownership to the works of others.\n\nHere again Walden and Nazarov cited their strategy of engaging public institutions as an example of how the platform will seek to acquire the trust of its users.\n\nThe Mine team said they have been working on a platform that would allow Mediachain users to annotate images, but use a reputation system so that others can begin to trust the information on its platform.\n\n“I could claim I made the Mona Lisa, so the way we think about it is, this federated approach lets you trust people to vouch for a metadata’s correctness. That is where we see the value will be,” Nazarov said.\n\nThey also suggested they believe the Mediachain community would gain or lose trust over time depending on how it maintains its open-access resource.\n\nHere, Nazarov cited the success of past Internet community efforts and their ability to achieve reputation as evidence that the approach could prove successful.\n\n""On Wikipedia, if you read an article about George Bush, you believe that it’s factual because Wikipedia is a credible source,"" Nazarov explained.\n\nMajor media applications\n\nOnce off and running, the Mine team believes Mediachain could be incorporated into existing popular social media platforms.\n\nNew media companies like Tumblr, they said, could enable its users to search images, even those substantial altered by subsequent creators, by using its API. This, in turn, they said, would enable Tumblr to better monetize through improved analytics.\n\n""As soon as the content hits Tumblr, they lose all analytics. An incentive is you get cross-platform analytics and we think that is a compelling incentive for larger platforms,"" Nazarov said.\n\nFuthermore, Nazarov and Walden see applications as Facebook and Apple both explore deals that could see them hosting the content of major global media outlets.\n\nWith reliable information on identity and rights, Nazarov and Walden suggested these efforts would be better able to meet the needs of even major business content creators.\n\n""The idea here is that, as a publisher, CoinDesk would be able to publish an article and set the terms for that article for it to be consumed in an application like Facebook Instant Articles,"" Nazarov said.\n\nThey went so far as to project that new efforts could spring up more easily, allowing innovation on a platform layer that has so far produced mostly market-leading players such as Spotify and Netflix, with few competitors in between.\n\nFor now, however, Mediachain cautions that its use of new technology may slow its efforts, as IPFS is best described as a ""bleeding-edge"" technology, and its ability to advance on development goals may affect their own roadmap.\n\nFurther, the Mediachain team sees subsequent issues in ensuring the durability of its database, as well as in creating standards for metadata.\n\nStill, the platform is now soliciting developers for its efforts to attack such challenges, cautioning in its launch post:\n\n""We are only getting started.""\n\nImage credit: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Without proper security measures put in place, there is no guaranteeing customer funds are safe and secure at all times. BitLox has announced a new line of physical Bitcoin wallets which are not only more secure and privacy-centric but also nearly indestructible.\n\nAlso read: 21 Bitcoin Computer Enthusiasts Will Come Together In San Francisco\n\nBitLox Presents A Strong Case\n\nWhen it comes to physical Bitcoin wallets, there has to be a mix of both software and hardware security. BitLox has taken a unique route by creating a wallet solution encased in titanium and aerospace alloys while still keeping the size incredibly small. The BitLox wallet weighs all but 25 grams, and is 4 mm thick, making it very similarly shaped to a credit or debit card.\n\nDespite the device being very small, there is a two-inch e-paper display on the front or the physical wallet. But it is under the hood where BitLox wants to differentiate themselves from the competition, by offering multiple layers of protection, focusing on privacy, and even Tor-based access.\n\nDigital currency enthusiasts do not often think of Darknet access when using a physical Bitcoin wallet, but BitLox feels there is a large market for such a solution. By using Tor as a gateway to the Darknet, completely anonymity can be offered to Bitcoin users all over the world. To make matters even more privacy-centric, built-in support for TailsOS is available as well.\n\nHidden wallets are an integral part of the BitLox device as well, although it remains to be seen how the company plans to achieve this. Users can allegedly stash funds in separate wallets although the hidden wallets can not be proven to exist. This is quite a bold claim, considering every Bitcoin address ever created is visible on the blockchain. The press release mentions how up to 50 hidden wallets can be generated, yet fails to provide any further information.\n\nFor the more paranoid Bitcoin users among us, there is a self-destruct function for PIN codes – of which there can be a maximum of four – associated with the device under duress. This results in resetting BitLox to its factory settings and wipes all of the device’s memory. Unfortunately, this will also mean all wallets associated with the physical Bitcoin wallet will be wiped clean.\n\nIf that weren’t enough to get people to buy a BitLox, Anti Evil Maid integration it at one’s disposal. Just in case some people doubted whether or not their BitLox is the genuine device – and not a US$300 replica – a special recognition phrase can be set up to verify the authenticity of the physical Bitcoin wallet.\n\nA Lot of Promises, But Can They Deliver?\n\nEveryone can clearly see the BitLox Bitcoin wallet hold a lot of promise, assuming the development team can make true on all of these features. While there may be several over-the-top features for everyday consumers to take advantage of, it is better to offer too many security measures rather than too few.\n\nThat being said, very few people will be willing to spend US$300 for a device that may or may not work as advertised. It is the first time BitLox presents a product to the public, and there is no previous reputation to speak of. However, with mobile apps and a Chrome Extension ready to be used for managing funds on the BitLox device, the case is somewhat compelling to take the plunge for some Bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nSource: PR Newswire\n\nNewsBTC has contacted BitLox for additional comments. This article will be moderated accordingly.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Transaction delays and the demands of extensive personal information alienate some users from buying and selling Bitcoin. ?oinTelegraph spoke to Robert Genito, CEO of Genitrust (which owns Wall of Coins), about private and instant Bitcoin trading.\n\nThe now-defunct BitInstant provided a fast, private method of trading Bitcoin, until it was shut down following the arrest of its CEO, Charlie Shrem, on money-laundering charges. Now, Wall of Coins’ Robert Genito talks about how it is still possible today to exchange Bitcoins fast and without divulging private information.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Have you found potential Bitcoin users being turned off by the delay in purchasing or offloading Bitcoins through methods like exchanges?\n\nRobert Genito: Yes. The biggest turn off is how much information markets ask for buyers. Giving information is either inconvenient (because the buyer has to take pictures and collect things), or they don\'t like the privacy infraction.\n\nCT: Does Wall of Coins have that same limitation?\n\nRG: No, because we operate differently.\n\nCT: How is that?\n\nRG: Let me make it easy for you: With Wall of Coins, the only requirement we always put on our buyers is the need for an SMS-compatible phone number, and this is to SMS text you the instructions to buy your Bitcoin. Should the buyer need help or phone our call center, Wall of Coins staff knows the authorized individual to discuss the order with by looking up the buyer’s phone number. At the same time, we are absolutely compliant. We only ask for extra information when it is absolutely necessary.\n\nOther exchanges, such as Coinbase or Circle, need a lot of information from their users to mitigate risk created by the outdated electronic systems: bank account, credit cards, identification, etc. While many power users are fine and happy with this, the general public is not. In many cases, the general public does not even meet all of the requirements--such as having a bank account or credit card--and this shuts people out of obtaining bitcoin in the first place.\n\nCT: Before (or without knowledge of) Wall of Coins, how did most people tend to instantly and privately offload/buy Bitcoin?\n\nRG: Well, once upon a time there was bitinstant.com. For today, no one really gets people Bitcoin ""instantly."" Even on Local Bitcoins the ""instant release"" sellers take 10-15 minutes, and that can be intimidating for buyers, or even just an annoyance for the buyer to talk with multiple sellers and hope that one will respond. People would use Bitquick, but they\'d get their Bitcoin three hours later. Wall of Coins consistently delivers bitcoin to its buyers in less than 10 minutes after payment verification.\n\nCT: Have these challenges tended to drive people to using local meetups or using BTMs?\n\nRG: Most people who are getting Bitcoin for cash don\'t know about local meetups, to be frank. As for BTMs, they don\'t exist all over the USA. Wall of Coins supports over 100,000 locations, and there are far less than that number of BTMs deployed in the USA.Wall of Coins turns all banks, remittance centers, and any physical business location into a virtual Bitcoin ATM. From my understanding, people do love the BTMs. They don\'t always like the fee, though. Some have really high fees; I\'ve heard of fees in excess of 20% in New York City.\n\nCT: Where do you see user trends pointing in the future for instant/private transactions?\n\nRG: As in, what do I believe bitcoin buyers/sellers want? So, I absolutely know at the edge of the industry what will bring buyers and sellers even greater convenience, but at the moment, the best representation of that is what Wall of Coins has to offer. It is an model exchange on many levels.\n\nAs far as the industry goes, our buyers/sellers who are experienced with the industry already believe that Wall of Coins is the best example to customer support, best example to a speedy process for the customer, and best overall customer satisfaction. Bitcoin itself sets the bar for instant/private transactions, and Bitcoin itself is the true influence and model of how we need to run business. As a whole, we must all become like Bitcoin, or as close to it as possible given the limitations the state puts forward.\n\nCT: Over the years, have you seen Bitcoin users become less tolerant to giving up personal information in order to buy or sell?\n\nRG: No, I haven\'t seen people become less or more tolerant. Each person feels differently on this. One thing for certain is that with so many people sharing their personal information with tons of bitcoin brokers online, scammers have easy access to a plethora of information to arm themselves with fraudulent activities. Today\'s slow-and-outdated businesses are using KYC/AML policies that were not made for an age where everyone has unrestricted access to information.', 'Bitcoin’s core contributors and CEOs from the Bitcoin industry propose a hard-fork but Xapo and Coinbase CEOs disagree.\n\nA roundtable conference on Bitcoin was held on 21st February 2016 in Cyberport in Hong Kong, China. The meeting was attended by many prominent people related to Bitcoin, including, CEOs of Bitfury, Bitmain, Han Solo, Blockcloud, A-XBT, BIT-X Exchange, Coinfloor, and Huobi, among others. The meeting was also attended by five of Bitcoin’s core contributors, namely, Cory Fields, Johnson Lau, Luke Dashjr, Matt Corallo, and Peter Todd.\n\nA general consensus was reached and signed by all the CEOs, Bitcoin core contributors, members of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, and other attendees.\n\nConsensus on hard-fork in the Bitcoin industry\n\nAn official statement issued by the Conference read:\n\n“We understand that SegWit continues to be developed actively as a soft-fork and is likely to proceed towards release over the next two months, as originally scheduled. We will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork, based on the improvements in SegWit. The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit. This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community. We will run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core. We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production, for the foreseeable future. We are committed to scaling technologies which use block space more efficiently, such as Schnorr multisig.”\n\nThe statement further said that the hard-fork will be activated by July 2017 if strong support from the Bitcoin industry is received. The statement also stated that the code for the hard-fork will be available by July 2016.\n\nCriticism from Coinbase and Xapo\n\nThe proposal, however, soon invited criticism from Coinbase and Xapo’s CEOs.\n\nBrian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, wrote a blogpost highlighting his disagreement with the proposal. As per Armstrong, prioritizing SegWit before a block size increase would be a mistake. He wrote: “SegWit contains several good features, but it is not a good solution to help bitcoin scale, which is the most urgent problem we need to solve. My understanding is that Core believes SegWit contains features which are necessary to add before a hard fork can safely occur (to prevent certain attack vectors). However, I believe Classic already contains code that prevents these attack vectors.”\n\nHe also adds that July 2017 is “too far” away to raise the block size, and there are better options available:\n\n“Bitcoin Classic, has already taken action and shipped a working solution in code that we can use today. That solution was written and reviewed by two former core developers, so I believe it is a high quality option. In the future, if Core ships a great improvement to the protocol, I will have no problem running that software. But if they haven’t shipped that software yet, and someone else has, there is no reason to wait.”\n\nHe makes his final point that this plan should be rejected because Bitcoin protocol development shouldn’t be done by a single group, but rather Bitcoin should have a multi-party system where several teams compete to add features to the protocol.\n\nThe CEO of Xapo, and a recent addition the PayPal’s Board of Directors, also tweeted in support of Armstrong:\n\n“The Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus Proposal — Too Little, Too Late” by @brian_armstrong https://t.co/lbDW6b5owj — Wences Casares (@wences) February 22, 2016']"

Since then, he has remained in the custody of the US Marshals Service, court records show.\n\nNow, the government is saying that it thinks that Bridges may have been involved with other, previously undisclosed thefts from the Silk Road, which was shuttered in late 2013. The disclosure came as part of 17th February response to a request by Bridges for a hearing on his detention.\n\nThe filing states:\n\n""...the US had recently become aware of additional thefts of bitcoins from Secret Service accounts, the facts of which led the government to believe that Bridges, working with others, was also involved in these thefts.""\n\nBridges is also seeking to unseal the search and seizure warrants used during his arrest in January, court documents show.

This would mean that virtual money, such as Bitcoin, would become the regulatory equivalent of conventional currency.\n\nLegislators of the financial services industry believe that this move could potentially strengthen consumer protection and create growth in the virtual economy. At the moment, Bitcoin is recognized as “an object,” but it is not considered equal to more established forms of currency.\n\nThe proposed changes to the definition of virtual currencies would mean that items such as Bitcoin could be used to purchase goods and services. Additionally, they would be considered exchangeable for legal tender via trade or purchase.\n\nHowever, acknowledging virtual currency as an equivalent to conventional currency would require certain institutions to register with the Financial Services Agency.\n\nThis is not the first time Japan has examined Bitcoin and its global use, as seen in a press conference held in 2014. At the time, Finance Minister Taro Aso addressed how Bitcoin has been treated in Japan, as well as around the world.\n\n“The media may regard it as such, but it is not a currency that everyone recognizes as currency, so I don’t really know whether the Ministry of Finance or the Financial Services Agency should have jurisdiction over something that is not a currency, whether the Consumer Affairs Agency should have jurisdiction because it is used by consumers, or whether the National Police Agency should have jurisdiction because a crime may have been committed,” said Aso. “In Japan, the issue is quite advanced, so for quite some time I have thought that some actions might have to be taken in Japan, though I think that this time has come much earlier than expected.”\n\nCurrently, there are more than 600 forms of virtual currencies used around the world. As of February 24, one bitcoin holds the value of approximately 47,000 Japanese yen.\n\nAs the prominence of virtual currencies continues to grow, Nikkei reports that monetary authorities are attempting to institute regulations to address issues, such as money laundering.\n\nIn 2015, Aso addressed the use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies for the purpose of funding terrorism and other crimes.\n\n“I think it was at the G7 summit that discussions addressed the need to introduce regulations in order to prevent terrorist funding, tackle money laundering, and so on,” Aso said. “We’ve gathered a lot of information, and I think that the actual ways the currencies are used need to be properly reflected, and I think that studies need to continue concerning an approach.”', 'Bitt has launched a blockchain-based version of the Barbadian dollar, a new product that it believes will help its service appeal to underbanked users in its home country.\n\nThe announcement follows two days of local engagement, including a private launch on Monday held at local restaurant Buzo Osteria Italiana, and an international launch during a cruise on Tuesday that took place in conjunction with the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2016 conference in Barbados.\n\nSo far, the engagements have earned Bitt coverage from the Caribbean Broadcast Corporation (CBC), as it seeks to better highlight its goal of creating a financial settlement network for the 15 nations in the CARICOM region.\n\nBitt CEO Gabriel Abed said that the formal unveiling moves the startup toward ""phase three"" of its launch plan, telling CoinDesk:\n\n“Our goal as an organization is to build an ecosystem. We launched our exchange nine months ago. Now, we’ve launched our second phase, the digital fiat dollar. Whatever you want to call it, it’s the dollar in Barbados digitized as an IOU that can be sent and received.”\n\nAbed said Bitt now intends to focus on developing a teller and ATM network to allow users to exchange digital dollars and bitcoin for hard currency, and for the startup to compete against remittance giants such as MoneyGram and Western Union.\n\nBitt will now seek to equip its mobile app to allow users to perform know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks as necessary to help it build a network for currency exchange, he explained.\n\nAbed went on to suggest that there is widespread support for the idea among potential users in Barbados, including small business owners at gas stations and barber shops who want to add new services for customers.\n\n""We have all these people who want to sign up because the solution has never existed before [in Barbados]. We don’t have e-commerce on this island, but we have 100% penetration of mobile,"" he said.\n\nLaunching in 2015, Bitt has so far raised $1.5m and built a team of 16 employees.\n\nTechnical development\n\nTo create its digital dollar, Bitt takes advantage of the Colored Coins protocol, which allows for the creation of new assets on top of the bitcoin blockchain.\n\n""This new layer can be used to assign a specific type of asset to a small fraction of a bitcoin,"" the company explains in an informational brochure.\n\nBitt’s version of the Barbadian dollar is therefore able to act as a digital asset, with its value honored 1:1 with the country’s government-backed currency.\n\nAbed went on to state that transactions on this network can be observed by the government and local regulators as they are sent peer-to-peer to Bitt wallets.\n\nIn the future, Abed said, Bitt aims to upgrade its functionality via new technologies such as Liquid, Blockstream’s project that enables bitcoin funds to move between exchanges, and BitGo Instant, a tool that enables zero-confirmation transactions.\n\nThe startup says these offerings will help it appeal to users who may be turned off by bitcoin’s sometimes unpredictable market volatility and slow confirmation speeds.\n\nCall for unity\n\nIn interview, Abed also issued a call to action that speaks to what he considers the vital need for next-generation money services options in Barbados and around the caribbean.\n\nMost notably, he blasted the in-fighting among developers that he sees as a barrier to bitcoin-enabled financial services that provide real assistance to those in need.\n\n""I need the bitcoin community,"" Abed said. ""[Screw] Bitcoin Classic. [Screw] Bitcoin Core. This is our last fighting chance to have a global system before the government [restricts access to] bitcoin. [We need to] look at the ecosystem and realize this is possible.""\n\nHe further warned that the perceived limitations of the bitcoin blockchain are putting his business at risk as it seeks to help lower the costs of remittances for real-world users.\n\n""It’s time to push,"" he said. ""Yesterday was more of a formality. Bitt is here, we’re in your face and it\'s a free-to-use financial solution.""\n\nAbed’s comments, while impassioned, sought to portray the larger goal of financial inclusion as an issue that has been lost in the prolonged conversation surrounding how the bitcoin blockchain can scale to accommodate new users.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Bitcoin\'s cool, blockchain is great, but we’re applying the tech in an ecosystem where that’s never been done before.""\n\nBarbadian dollar image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He labels the project purely marketing and hints what they are creating is a form of an alternative digital currency, also known as an alt-coin.\n\nThis, a controversial opinion in Bitcoin circles, has major implications about how the Bitcoin protocol evolves from here. In his essay, Cohen writes:\n\nLet’s say that you’re running a company and want to create some internal competition between teams to see which ones can perform better. You can do this with R&D, and sales, but I would humbly suggest that you don’t do it with receivables. Sending out duplicate invoices to customers is generally referred to as ‘criminal behavior’. But the CEO of Coinbase is seriously claiming, with no hint of sarcasm, that this is exactly what Bitcoin should do. Rather than claiming that a hard fork could be done cleanly and without a split, he’s instead doubling down and saying that the chaos and thievery which would come with two active competing forks would be ‘healthy competition’.\n\nThis flies in the perspective of what many leading Bitcoin proponents are saying. Roger Ver sided with what Cohen terms ‘Classiccoin,’ calling it the correct solution. Whatever led him to this conclusion is not technical expertise in Bitcoin development. On any given day of the week, I am certainly siding with the FOUNDER OF BITTORRENT before Bitcoin Jesus. You should too.\n\nSo, forget Bitcoin Classic. Classic coin from the get-go was a marketing scheme. Who can forget the time Jonathon Toomim mentioned that Bitcoin developers need a PR Team? The ego and bravado of launching a PR distraction under the guise of intellectual discussion is palpable. It’s amazing how so many segments of the Bitcoin space has been given to naif neophytes with grand delusions of Wall Street and Silicon Valley excess via Bitcoin pursuits all the while producing nought.\n\nAs the singer of SST punk rock band The Minutemen, D. Boon, once said: “Let the products sell themselves, fuck advertising, psychological methods should be destroyed.” Perhaps hyperbolic, that sentiment should be reflected in the renegade circles of the Bitcoin community. Instead, the Community by-and-large turns to marketing methods to package and sell self-interest, combining in some ways the worst of Silicon Valley and Wall Street.\n\nThe “Bitcoin Community” is nothing more than a convention of minds in the lower echelons of the Bitcoin hierarchy, with vendors and pitchmen trying to get by in the crypto-hustle. As Cohen states about the wrongheaded opinions of some of Bitcoin’s influential minds:\n\nI don’t know why the CEO of Coinbase is advocating for this insanity. It’s possibly because Coinbase would be well positioned to engage in the sort of chicanery explained above. But it’s equally plausible that he’s just an idiot. Either way, I’m no longer going to give credence to the pretext that we’re having a serious technical discussion in which both sides have good points. My response to overtly destructive acts is, and will continue to be, to tell people to fuck off.\n\nIn my personal opinion, Bitcoin is in crisis. Not the protocol, but the “Community” itself. Its identity has been usurped. For so long many of the people associated with Bitcoin thought they were bringing down banking but now Bitcoin technology has been commercially adopted by major banks and not in a way where many Bitcoin entrepreneurs and innovators will be brought along. Those with the good jobs working in Bitcoin technology will be financial technologists with working understanding of blockchain technologies and careers much older than Bitcoin.\n\nSo where does that leave Bitcoin? It leaves it where it began. As an independent iteration of digital currency – the first, in fact. That’s pretty cool. But in their pursuit to eat cake from the plate of banks, Bitcoiners could run their online creation community into the ground with bullshit technology like Bitcoin Classic and others.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should the be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Gemini, the New York-based bitcoin exchange founded by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has revamped its fee schedule, to encourage an ""active, stable and efficient marketplace"".\n\nThe service was launched just over four months ago and, according to a new blog post by president Cameron Winklevoss, has now collected sufficient data to determine the best fee strategy going forwards.\n\nWinklevoss writes:\n\n""We have decided to adjust our existing flat fee schedule to a real-time, dynamic maker-taker fee schedule.""\n\nAdopting the maker-taker fee system is aimed to encourage \'makers\', who add liquidity to the exchange, which offers a BTC/USD market aimed at institutional investors.\n\nCameron Winklevoss explained that because liquidity-making orders do not fill immediately and they bear more market risk, the company ""believes in offering greater incentives to makers"".\n\nTo kick off the promotion, the new schedule will be available to all Gemini users for 30 days, during which traders will receive a 0.15% rebate on all liquidity-making trades and be charged 0.15% on all liquidity-taking trades.\n\nThe new fee schedule is open to all customers from 15:30 BST on 1st March to 15:30 BST on 31st March.\n\nFee concerns\n\nThe announcement follows comments from bitcoin traders that Gemini\'s original pricing model, charging both buyers and sellers on each trade, could prove an issue that will drive away retail traders – a group that could be essential for building liquidity.\n\nTop bitcoin exchanges around the world offer greater liquidity than Gemini can yet offer, meaning traders on those exchanges are able to cash in and out of the market more quickly, a much more active market participants argued at the time, for profit-making.\n\nOne aspect that came under repeated criticism was the exchange\'s plan to charge 25 basis points (0.25%) to the buyer and seller on each side of any trade.\n\nWith today\'s announcement, Gemini seems to have taken these criticisms on board and is now offering a sliding scale of fees, and even rebates for liquidity makers (see table below).\n\nLiquidity takers will pay fees of 25 bps but can be discounted to 15 bps under certain conditions (see the blog post for the full details).\n\nThe post notes that fees and rebates will be based on gross trading volume and the liquidity-making buy/sell ratio over the previous 30-day window.\n\nFurther, individual fee rates for traders will be reassessed every 24 hours and adjusted accordingly.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Armed with self-executing smart contracts, proponents of the technology have envisioned ways to replace everything that today requires a centralized leadership, from businesses and services to governments.\n\nIn some ways, bitcoin could be considered the first dapp, as it is fully open-source, rewards contributors, runs without a central authority and uses blockchain technology to help facilitate its continued use case as an online currency.\n\nNext-generation innovators are now seeking to apply these same principles to a variety of online services they believe could be built in the dapp format, armed with a little effort, know-how and the will to charge forward into the unknown.\n\nAlthough a new field, dapps are growing in number and many now exist in various stages of completeness, from concept to working prototype and functional platform.\n\nEthereum\'s decentralised blockchain and its native digital currency Ether are proving perhaps the most widely used tools for dapp building, as its network is specifically built for the purpose and the Ethereum Foundation, its trade organization overseeing development, runs regular \'hackathon\' events to promote new decentralized applications.\n\nBut what can you do with a dapp?\n\nFor this feature, CoinDesk casts its eye over the current offerings and picks out seven of the more interesting projects being developed using the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEnriching the web\n\nThe Vevue project promises to ""bring Google Street View to life"", by enabling users to take 30-second video clips of restaurants, hotels, places, events and more to share with other around the world.\n\nAll users need is a smartphone, and by answering requests pinned in their neighbourhood they can earn bitcoin or even Vevue equity tokens in selected areas.\n\nFurthermore, with the project\'s Google Chrome extension, \'Vevues\' are available when browsers use Google Maps to search local businesses.\n\nThe ""Make Videos, Earn Bitcoin"" app is already available on the Google Play store, though is not in its final state and does not currently reward users.\n\nBuilding virtual worlds\n\nEtheria is a Minecraft-like virtual world in which players can own tiles, \'farm\' them for blocks and build things.\n\nAccording to the project website, the ""entire state of the world is held in and all player actions are made through the decentralized, trustless Ethereum blockchain"".\n\nUntil now, it points out, all virtual worlds have been controlled by a single entity. All aspects of Etheria, on the other hand, are ""agreed to"" by the participants of the Ethereum network without central authority.\n\nThis means Etheria cannot be censored or taken down by the government, by its ""owner-players"" or even by the developer, \'fivedogit\'. In effect, it will exist as long as Ethereum does.\n\nManaging identity\n\nIn the digital age, the increasing risk of financial crime arising from fraud and identity theft demonstrates the importance of a reliable means to safeguard the individual\'s identity.\n\nTo that end, KYC-Chain aims to provide consensus on the identity of individuals at the ""highest level of trust"".\n\nThe service, which is currently under construction, utilises existing know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, and plans to bring ""ease and simplicity"" to the process of identification for businesses wishing to onboard new customers.\n\nThe platform\'s ""identity wallets"" will allow users to share only the information necessary, and nothing more.\n\nKYC-Chain employs Ethereum and will work primarily via the use of ""trusted gatekeepers"", who can be any individual or legal entity permitted by law to authenticate KYC documents – for example, notary publics, people of diplomatic status, lawyers, governments, and so on.\n\nA trusted gatekeeper would perform an individual check on a user’s ID using KYC-Chain\'s platform and authenticate them. The files would be stored in a distributed database system, which can later be retrieved by the trusted gatekeeper, or the user, to demonstrate with certainty that the ID is genuine.\n\nHelping developing businesses\n\n4G Capital provides instant access to credit for small business growth in Africa, and has developed a concept dapp for the use of smart contracts.\n\nDonors would be able to use the dapp to fund small businesses in Kenya using digital currency. The money lent would be converted and disbursed to the businesses using 4G Capital\'s transactional system.\n\nIts vision is to empower individuals, businesses and markets by delivering financial inclusion and supporting change across Africa from the grass roots level.\n\nAs well as providing 100% unsecured debt funding to self-employed informal market traders, the project provides micro-consulting and business training to increase customer skill levels and business knowledge.\n\nMicro-blogging\n\nCurrently a working prototype, Eth-Tweet is a decentralised microblogging service running on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides basic Twitter-like functionality to tweet messages of up to 160 characters.\n\nBeing decentralised means no central entity controls what is being published, and once a message is posted, it can only be removed by the publisher.\n\nFurther, accounts can receive donations in Ether, which the team suggests can be an incentive to run provide content via the platform.\n\nEmpowering artists\n\nAmpliative Art aims to enhance the conditions and prospects of artists via a social network-like platform.\n\nWhen complete, it will be a reciprocity-based web platform with which individuals can contribute to the art community and be rewarded through ""alternative means"".\n\nArtists will be able to create their own galleries and exhibit their works for free, and both users and artists can be rewarded through tips and donations, comments and reviews, share or exchange proposals. The more a user contributes to the community, the more the community is likely to reward them.\n\nAny revenues earned by the organization will be distributed according the ""reputations"" of the users, the website states.\n\nAs a dapp, Ampliative Art will be a transparent cooperative in which users would collaborate, receive rewards and take part in the decision making process.\n\nCrowdfunding\n\nWeiFund uses Web 3.0-enabled technology to provide a crowdfunding solution on the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe project says that since it will be one of many crowdfunding platforms on Web 3.0, it aims to stimulate these platforms by providing ""world-class open-source modular and extensible"" crowdfunding utilities that everyone can access. All critical aspects of the platform are completely decentralized.\n\nTo use WeiFund, users will first open WeiFund in a Web 3.0 enabled browser such as Ethereum\'s Mist. From there they can then start, contribute to, browse and manage crowdfunding campaigns.\n\nWeiFund\'s interface and user experience will be very similar to that of conventional crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe, however, all funds raised on WeiFund will be accounted for in the Ether digital currency.\n\nUnlike conventional crowdfunding services like Kickstarter, though, WeiFund uses smart contracts, which means donations can actually be turned into complex agreements. This gives campaign operators a ""broader range of possibilities ""when raising funds, the project says.\n\nFurther, Web 3.0-enabled browsers will come with their own wallet systems, so that payments made on WeiFund to start and contribute to campaigns are carried out in a ""secure and verifiable way"".\n\nPicture frame and cellphone images via Shutterstock; Feature image via Ethereum.org\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Safe Cash is an end-to-end secure payment platform giving banks, businesses and consumers instant and final cash-based transactions.\n\nBanks provide tokens redeemable for cash, allowing cash to be used as a digital asset. Transaction settlement occurs in less than 5 seconds.\n\n“It (cash) is the only payment today that hasn’t been brought into the electronic ecosystem,” a video noted on the company website.\n\nWorks With Bank Infrastructure\n\nSafe Cash works with most browsers, Android and iOS, offering the benefits of cash minus the inconveniences of being slow and often not secure. There are no chargebacks. Once funds are confirmed, a transaction cannot be nullified.\n\nThe software works with existing bank infrastructures and transforms a bank’s standard demand deposit account into a secure digital cash account with global utility. Bank customers make deposits in exchange for tokens. The funds remain on the bank’s balance sheet, and the tokens circulate among merchants, consumers and licensed money businesses.\n\nBanks can use Safe Cash to develop web tools for specific uses with REST (representational state transfer) APIs.\n\nBlockchain Benefits Cash Transactions\n\nThe blockchain technology provides a permanent record that is created electronically and is backed up automatically in multiple locations. All transactions are recorded and provide real-time compliance.\n\nThe service offers new revenue streams for banks and merchants, such as loyalty programs, customer acquisition programs, immediate P2P, B2B and B2P payments, cross-border remittances, social media payments, donations, and recurring payments.\n\nThe software provides analytics and tools that allow merchants to communicate directly with customers.\n\nChris Kitze, the CEO and founder of Safe Cash Payment Technologies, said bitcoin is not a reasonable solution for banks because of uncertain governance, slow consensus time, and it is not built to scale for mass adoption for immediate e-commerce, according to crowdfundinsider.com.\n\nKitze said the company has a path to increase the speed to 100,000 transactions per second later this year, which is ahead of global demand. He said the development team has worked for 18 months to solve technical issues.\n\nThe system has been designed to operate on most phones.\n\nPermissioned blockchains are gaining favor with financial institutions over freely-traded cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ripple or Ethereum, he said. Safe Cash, by contrast, is among the first blockchains to meet the transaction speed and throughput needs of today’s market.\n\nAlso read: JPMorgan already testing dollar remittance via block chain technology among 2,200 clients\n\nAdvantages Over Cryptocurrencies\n\nSafe Cash offers increased security and controlled consensus that does not rely on miners of any intermediary coin that needs to be bought. It enables banks to wean themselves from the inefficient, high-cost SWIFT network which can take days to transfer money.\n\nThe system allows banks to have their own “white label” blockchain which they manage and control. They can achieve interbank settlement with multi-currency wallets, a separate bank settlement blockchain, or a combination of these depending on legal compliance and bank requirements.\n\nKitze said no other open source solution can match Safe Cash performance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As the technology of Bitcoin enters the mainstream, so will security options for the protection of your Bitcoin. Trezor raised the state-of-the-art when it came to Bitcoin security, with the ability to take your Bitcoins offline and back at your convenience, or for your security. Case Wallet makes your Bitcoin security handy, mobile, and tough to crack, adding unique biometrics, GSM chips, and multi-sig procedures to the wallet. Now, a new competitor comes out of Hong Kong known as BitLox . Does it deserve a piece of the Bitcoin security pie?\n\nMobility Mixes With Security and Convenience\n\nMost like the mobile Case Wallet introduced last year, BitLox comes in two flavors, Advanced or Ultimate. Both come with a leather carrying case and weigh just 25 grams, so they are designed to fit in a standard leather wallet. The primary difference seems to be in the unit’s design, as the Ultimate is built out of titanium, and is priced at $299. The Advanced is made with “aerospace grade alloy,” and matches the case Wallet’s $199 price. This sum is payable in either PayPal or Bitcoin. BitLox’s CEO Dana Coe spoke with DCE Brief about this new product and what can do for the Bitcoin security market.\n\n“BitLox is designed for mobile use with built-in Bluetooth capabilities for use with your mobile phone. It sports a full keyboard on the device itself - no worries about your PINs / mnemonics being snooped by a compromised computer. At BitLox, we highly value your privacy and independence - your keys are only on your BitLox, and we have no control over any part of your funds or transactions.”\n\nCoe says the main advantages BitLox provides is the “plausible deniability” of the wallet’s existence. You see, the wallet comes with 100 wallets inside, and fifty of these wallets can remain hidden; only the user knows of these. With the rather large keyboard, PIN passcode can be up to twenty characters, dramatically increasing protection from “brute force attacks.” Optimized to work with smartphones, it works through iOS or Android apps, not an Internet connection, again, for increased security and mobility.\n\nFor $399 USD, an individual can step up to the BitLox Extreme Privacy Set, if the aforementioned features seem a little light when it comes to Bitcoin protection. Here, owners get a BitLox Ultimate Hardware Bitcoin Wallet and a military-grade USB Vault with TAILS OS preinstalled. This means you can use your BitLox with the absolute privacy of Darknet access tools, and can also be used with BitLox’s TOR-based web access, or even the new I2P privacy network.\n\nMy final inquiry was on the possibility of altcoin integration in the future, which is a growing and underserved market, and Coe says he is actively working on this front for updates in the future.\n\n“We are working on an update to the firmware/apps to support altcoins. We have been in contact with the developers of DASH and Ethereum on adding support for these currencies to our signing capabilities.”\n\nThe weatherproof and shockproof BitLox wallet also operates in several languages, has a 2” full matrix screen and works with mobile Bluetooth LE, to easily keep a lengthy charge. A five-year warranty doesn’t hurt its business case either, so if you need more Bitcoin security than you may ever actually use, check out the BitLox.']"

The new definition would consider anything that can be exchanged for goods and services or legal tender as a currency, bringing bitcoin, dogecoin and many other cryptocurrencies into the fold.\n\nAccording to a report in the Nikkei newspaper, the changes were proposed by government body the Financial Services Agency. However, an FSA official in Tokyo refused to confirm that any changes to legislation were being considered.\n\n“We have not decided anything yet,” the official said. “The way things work here is that any change would have to be approved by parliament first, and then we would work on writing the legislation.”\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, the official declined to comment on whether the FSA had proposed the legislative changes.\n\nJapan, the home of Mt.

Following a year of debate on block size alteration and Bitcoin’s future, the North American Bitcoin Conference finally resulted in a more structured consensus to solve the issue long-term.\n\nThis Bitcoin conference was followed by another conference this month in Hong Kong, where it was announced that Bitcoin Hard-fork is to be activated by 2017 provided support from Bitcoin community is there.\n\nBitFury CEO Valery Vavilov told CoinTelegraph in emailed comments:\n\n“As a Bitcoin Blockchain industry leader, it was important to organize a meaningful dialogue among members of our community that allowed us to address this challenge and work to ensure the success of the Bitcoin Blockchain for the future.”\n\nThe issue of the block size reform has slowly grown to incorporate opinion from across cryptocurrency, and its initial results, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited, continue to draw varying responses from businesses and consumers alike.\n\nThe Bitcoin Conference Consensus\n\nWhile Bitcoin Classic gained a fair following in light of its second beta release last month, concerns still remain as to effects of competing blockchains operating simultaneously. Advocates, meanwhile, opt for demonstrable results and experimentation over continued long-term speculation in order to secure Bitcoin’s commercial future and overall reputation.\n\nAn official statement issued by the conference read:\n\n“We think any contentious hard-fork contains additional risks and potentially may result in two incompatible blockchain versions, if improperly implemented. To avoid potential losses for all bitcoin users, we need to minimize the risks. It is our firm belief that a contentious hard-fork right now would be extremely detrimental to the bitcoin ecosystem.”\n\nThe conference supported for an initial block size limit increase through SegWit, an opinion reiterated again in the Hong Kong round table conference.\n\nBitFury’s Stance\n\n“It was very encouraging to see how motivated the Bitcoin community is to come to consensus,” Vavliov commented on the atmosphere between parties at the round table. “The overall mood among the core developers, as well as the Bitcoin Blockchain companies, was optimistic and determined.”\n\nThe NABC round table featured the participation of, among others, Adam Back of BlockStream, Ledge Marco of Genesis Mining and Marshall Long from the Bitcoin Classic Team, as well as Blockchain.Info, core developers Gavin Anderson and Luke-Jr, and ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Roger Ver.\n\nThe result was a five-point plan on block size resolution, with the team specifically advising users to “act rationally and hold off on making any decision to run a contentious hard-fork” when it came to the Bitcoin Classic and Unlimited blockchains.\n\n“Our shared goal is the success of bitcoin,” the announcement of the round table’s outcomes concluded. “Bitcoin is strong and transformational. By working together, we will ensure that its future is bright.”\n\nVavlilov meanwhile elaborated on BitFury’s stance regarding the future preservation of Bitcoin’s ultimate usability.\n\n“A consensus about the block size issue has three major benefits for the community”, he explained:', 'Gemini has adjusted its flat fee schedule to a dynamic, real-time, “maker-taker” schedule after collecting enough data to know how to encourage a stable, efficient and active marketplace, according to a blog on the Gemini website by Cameron Winklevoss, president and co-founder.\n\nTo launch the program, every customer will get the most favorable fee and rebate rates of 15 bps (0.15%) rebate on liquidity-making trades and incur a 15 bps (0.15%) fee on all such trades for the following windows:\n\n• Current Gemini operation areas March 1, 2016 at 9:30 a.m. ET to March 31, 2016 at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\n• Future Gemini operation areas: 30 days from opening day for trading.\n\nDynamic Fee Schedule\n\nFollowing this period, each customer will be able to continue to receive discounted fees and rebates for trades.\n\nFees and rebates after the introductory period will be determined based on liquidity-making buy/sell ratio and gross trading volume over the prior 30-calendar-day window. The fee rate gets reassessed every 24 hours and is accordingly adjusted. Once the real-time fee system begins for the trader’s account, the current fee rate will be viewable on the activity feed at the top right side of the trader’s dashboard.\n\nReal Time Fee Calculation\n\nThe fees and rebates are calculated as a fraction of each trade’s notional value (i.e., price x size). Units of basis points (bps) that represent 1/100th of a percent of notional value determine the calculation. For example, a 25 bps fee means 0.25% of the dollar value of the trade is kept by the exchange, either deducted from gross proceeds of a trade or charged to the account when a trade executes. Fees and rebates are applied in real time at execution.\n\nMaker Versus Taker\n\nEach trade involves two orders – one providing liquidity to the order book and another removing liquidity from the order book. To provide liquidity, an order must first post in the order book. It doesn’t fill immediately; it has to wait until another market participant trades against it. This type of order adds liquidity to the marketplace and is known as “liquidity-making” – the customer placing it is referred to as a “maker.” An order that executes immediately against an existing order removes liquidity and is called a “taker.” Since liquidity-making orders do not immediately fill and bear more market risk, Gemini believes in offering more incentives to makers.\n\nMaker-Fee Schedule\n\nThe base fee for liquidity-making trades is 25 bps, although fees are reduced using the following independent criteria:\n\n• Trading Volume Discount: The fees are reduced based on the trader’s gross trading volume over a trailing 30-calendar-day window.\n\n• Buy/Sell Ratio Discount: Fees are reduced based on the ratio of the trader’s liquidity-making buys and their liquidity-making sales, both measured in BTC, over a trailing 30-calendar-day window.\n\nTaker-Fee Schedule\n\nThe base fee of all liquidity trades is 25 bps, but fees are reduced using the following criterion:\n\n• Trading Volume Discount: Fees get reduced based on the trader’s gross trading volume over a 30-calendar-day window.\n\nFee Discount And Rebate Examples\n\nA trader called Alice trades 8,000 BTC of gross volume over 30 calendar days. Out of those trades, 5,000 BTC are from liquidity-taking orders. Of the remaining 3,000 BTC of trades, Alice bought 1,750 BTC and sold 1,250 BTC, making the buy/sell ratio 58/42. Hence, the gross trading volume discount is 15 bps on the maker side and 10 bps on the taker side, and the liquidity-making buy/sell ratio discount is 10 bps on the maker side. The fee for liquidity-making trades is then reduced from the 25 bps base fee to 0 bps. There is no discount on the taker side, so the fee for liquidity-taking trades remains the base 25 bps fee.\n\nFor another example, a trader called Bob purchases 15,000 BTC over 30 calendar days. None of the trades are liquidity-making, so Bob is not eligible for a liquidity-making buy/sell ratio discount. The gross trading volume, however, delivers a gross trading volume of 25 bps on the maker side and 10 bps on the taker side. The fee then for liquidity-making trades is reduced from the base 25 bps fee to 0 bps and the fee for liquidity-taking trades is reduced from the 25 bps base fee and the fee for liquidity-taking trades gets reduced from the 25 bps base fee to 15 bps.\n\nFor another example, a trader called Eve trades 20,000 BTC of gross volume over 30 calendar days. From those trades, 12,000 BTC are from liquidity-taking orders. For the remaining 8,000 BTC, Eve bought 3,600 BTC and sold 400 BTC, making the buy/sell ratio 45/55. Hence, the gross trading volume discount is 25 bps on the maker side and 10 bps on the taker side. The liquidity-making buy/sell ratio discount is 15 bps on the maker side, and the fee for liquidity-taking trades is reduced from the 25 bps base fee to 15 bps.\n\nAny change to the universal fee structure will post no fewer than three calendar days before taking effect, and no changes will be in effect for less than 30 calendar days. This will include adjustments to any of the rates or tiers.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Gemini.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Paul Chou, CEO of LedgerX and the bitcoin advisor to the U.S. Commodities and Future Trading Commission (CFTC), says companies trying to use the blockchain without bitcoin are seriously misguided, and so far the concept is unproven, according to New York Business Journal.\n\nChou says bitcoin and blockchain are inextricably linked and must remain as such for blockchain technology to become widely adopted.

He has also applied to become a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) which would allow investors to hedge against their bitcoin investment risks.\n\nIf approved, LedgerX would be the first federally-regulated bitcoin clearing house and options exchange to list and clear fully-collateralized, physically-settled bitcoin options for the institutional market, CCN reported.\n\nBlockchain For Derivatives\n\nOn Tuesday Chou, who was appointed a member of the CFTC technical advisory committee, attended a committee meeting along with 100 people including technologists, CFTC staffers and others to discuss the application of distributed ledger technology to derivatives.\n\nConsensys and CME, a futures marketplace, and others shared ideas for how blockchain derivatives could help build a stronger derivatives market.\n\nChou said after the meeting he hopes staffers and regulators can create regulations with a better understanding of the blockchain and bitcoin.\n\nWithout the CFTC’s approval, a legal, U.S.-based derivatives market that could offset risks could not exist, undermining the currency’s growth.\n\nChou said the CFTC is a proper regulator for bitcoin because it has jurisdiction over derivative trading on any commodity or currency. He said the commission a lot of experience in this area.\n\nAlso read: LedgerX aims to operate first American regulated bitcoin-futures-exchange\n\nBitcoin Firms Explore Other Regulatory Paths\n\nOther regulatory avenues have been pursued for bitcoin. itBit, an exchange, received the first charter in May 2015 for a bitcoin company to operate as a trust, allowing the company to operate in all 50 states. Circle Internet Financial in September secured the first New York State BitLicense.\n\nFinancial institutions have taken an interest in the blockchain since it provides value for transactions other than bitcoin. Blockchain transactions occur nearly immediately compared to the three-day clearing time for many financial transactions. In addition, the higher transparency of the immutable ledger can make it easier for regulators to track bad actors and enforce legal actions.\n\nNumerous startups have attempted to capitalize on these blockchain capabilities, such as Digital Asset Holdings, JPMorgan Chase, Symbiont, Consensys, Duncan Niederauer, and R3CEV, a conglomerate of 42 global banks.\n\nChou said these are speculative proposals that take out one element in a complex system and have all the advantages of that system. “I don’t think are really correct,” he said. “I think the second you separate bitcoin from some of the other elements the use-cases of the individual elements are unlikely to be proven, in my view.”\n\nThe only thing that’s proven thus far is bitcoin as an asset class, he said. He said it is actively traded, is being used by consumers and merchants, and has a market cap.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The name Bitt may ring a bell for people who are experienced in the world of Bitcoin and blockchain, as the FinTech startup has been chosen to revamp the financial industry in the region.\n\nBlockchain technology can make a major impact on the world although the ramifications can vary greatly from country to country. Barbados is not a country most people would assume with the financial sector, but there is a growing FinTech scene in the region. Bitt is one of those companies who aim to become the settlement service of the Caribbean, and they are employing blockchain technology to achieve that goal.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin wallet Chip-Chap connects traditional banking with virtual currencies\n\nBitt Makes an Impact in Barbados\n\nThe name Bitt may ring a bell for people who are experienced in the world of Bitcoin and blockchain, as the FinTech startup has been chosen to revamp the financial industry in the region. In fact, the first blockchain-based digital money to see the light of day in the Caribbean was launched through Bitt not too long ago.\n\nOne thing people have to understand is how Barbados, among other Caribbean countries, has been struggling with the financial system for many decades now. As a result of these conflicts, there is very little to no banking infrastructure available in the region. This makes cash one of the preferred methods of payment in Barbados and surrounding countries.\n\nSuch an awkward financial situations left its mark on both companies and consumers in Barbados. Bitt wants to address this situation and play its role in putting the region on the economic landscape map. Other companies have been trying to make progress in this regard as well, although they have very little to show for it so far.\n\nSolving such a major problem will not be easy, though, albeit the introduction of blockchain technology could shake up things quite a bit. While there still are a lot of issues to sort out, the Barbadian Digital Dollar solves some of the problems associated with the lack of financial infrastructure. Sending and receiving money in a convenient manner is not always possible, but a digital version of fiat currency could address this problem rather quickly.\n\nWhat makes the concept of the Barbadian Digital Dollar even more appealing is how consumers can send and receive funds by using a mobile device. This will, in turn, influence the commercial side of everyday life, as frictionless payments start to make their way to business all over Barbados. Additionally, auditors will be able to verify the signatures in a cryptographic manner on an unparalleled security level.\n\nIt is important to note that the Barbadian Digital Dollar does not resemble Bitcoin by any means. As one would come to expect from a digitized version of fiat currency, one Barbadian Digital Dollar is worth the same as one Barbadian Dollar issued by the Central Bank. The integration of blockchain technology will allow consumers to do more with their money but in a digital fashion.\n\nExpanding The Service Beyond Barbadian Digital Dollar\n\nIf everything goes according to plan for Bitt, the company wants to expand their services to other countries in the Caribbean region as well. The Barbadian Digital Dollar is just the first step of showcasing what distributed ledger technology is capable of., and Bitt plays an integral part in that process.\n\nIn fact, Bitt Inc Co-Founder Gabriel Abed has stated how he wants to turn Bitt into the settlement service for the entire Caribbean region over the coming years. The company will keep focusing on mobile wallets, merchant solutions, remittance, and asset exchange over the next few years.\n\nSource: PR Web, Flickr', ""21 Inc has announced that its Bitcoin Computer mining device is now shipping to most European countries, including major markets such as the UK, France, Germany and Italy.\n\nThe news follows the company's recent expansion of sales to countries outside the US, starting with Canada. Further, 21 Inc said it is seeking to open up shipping to more countries over the coming weeks, and hinted that Asia could be next.\n\nThe startup further noted that, for EU purchasers, the device comes with the same software that customers in the US and Canada receive.\n\nLaunched in September 2015, 21's Bitcoin Computer is a small bitcoin miner intended to enable developers to create new apps powered by bitcoin micropayments.\n\nThe company has previously said it plans to create a bitcoin micropayments ecosystem powered by mining chips embedded in different devices.\n\nImage via 21 Inc\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Alcatel-Lucent was recently acquired by Nokia, though the patent predates that purchase and it is unclear if the project ever progressed past the patent stage.\n\nAlcatel-Lucent is the parent company of both Alcatel, best known for its telecommunications equipment and mobile networks, and Bell Laboratories, one of the most successful research companies in the world with eight Nobel prizes awarded for work done at the company. The credited inventors on the patent worked at the Bell Laboratories division of Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia now owns all three companies. It is also worth pointing out that the division of Nokia that used to produce cell phones split off from Nokia the telecommunications company and is currently owned by Microsoft (who has renamed it Microsoft Mobile). There is no apparent connection to Microsoft and the Alcatel deal or this patent.\n\nThe Alcatel name may also be familiar to anyone who is a fan of Chinese android phones. Alcatel Mobile Phones was co-created by Alcatel-Lucent and Chinese manufacturer TCL. However, in 2005, TCL purchased Alcatel’s share of the brand and it has wholly owned Alcatel Mobile Phones since 2005, well before this patent was issued.\n\nCompanies often patent potential products and inventions without ever using them. This is particularly true with Bell Laboratories, which boasts over 20,000 patents. With the Nokia, Alcatel merger, the situation is even more cloudy. So, this should hardly be taken as a confirmation that customers on the Alcatel or Nokia networks will soon find their phones pre-bundled with bitcoin wallets, but the very fact that they were working on a cryptographically powered decentralized payment system is interesting. The patent doesn’t indicate an Alcatel controlled centralized solution like Apple Pay or even a centralized bitcoin web wallet like Coinbase. Rather, the invention proposes a decentralized solution with a novel implementation involving two pieces of hardware. That should make it of interest to the larger bitcoin community, regardless of the current status of the project.\n\nTitled “Decentralized electronic transfer system” the patent was submitted on February 25th, 2013 and was publicly published on January 29th, 2015. The patent describes a mobile payment system that would not require a third party to clear transactions and would instead use a “decentralized system” that uses and generates its own private and public keys. The patent mentions Bitcoin by name six times but also points out that the invention “is not limited to Bitcoin, and is applicable in other decentralized electronic systems where transfers are made.”\n\nThe inventors cite the difficulty of storing and securing private and public keys as a major flaw in current decentralized monetary systems like bitcoin.\n\n“A drawback of the decentralized electronic transfer system is the risk of losing an unsecure repository, [wallet] and consequently losing all transfers made to this unsecure repository. Solutions have been provided in securing repositories thereby keeping them safe from theft and loss. This however is a drawback for the usability of decentralized electronic transfer systems as the bar to use the secure repository is significantly raised.”\n\nThe invention would have (or will if released) fixed this issue by giving the user two wallets stored on two different devices: one more secure and one easily accessible. It is unclear if the more secure wallet would be stored on more secure proprietary hardware or a personal computer.\n\n“The present invention provides in an embodiment a method and apparatus for use in a decentralized electronic currency system that solves the usability issue with the above solution to key management, while also providing a generic mechanism for reducing the risk of loss of funds, i.e. any amount of currency the user may have accumulated as a result of past transactions. The method is based on the use of two electronic devices, a first `safe` one, which is to be stored carefully and possibly regularly backed up, and a second `unsafe` one, which is suitable to be installed on portable devices and used for payments in mobility context.”\n\nWhat, exactly, Alcatel was planning on doing with this solution is not clear, though it seems like some sort of mobile currency storage and spending solution was in the works.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that in 2013, there wasn’t a successful mobile payment solution available for mobile payments. Google was offering its Wallet app, but it never hit the heights its current successor, Android Pay, has reached. It is possible Alcatel was exploring alternatives at the time and some of those alternatives apparently included cryptocurrency enabled decentralized payment solutions, but the landscape has changed significantly since then.\n\nAgain, it is not uncommon for companies to patent inventions they have no intention of using. That said, a decentralized bitcoin wallet being patented by one of France’s most popular telecommunications companies, which was just purchased for over $17 billion by one of the world’s largest telecommunication companies, is a note-worthy development, no matter the current status of the project.\n\nWe have reached out to both Alcatel and Nokia for comment but haven’t heard back at press time.', 'What do Bitcoin and U.S. Republican Presidential frontrunner Donald Trump have in common? Both are new to their respective arenas, both are highly disruptive to existing power structures, and both, at this point, are unstoppable.\n\nDisruption\n\nThe Trump campaign rose from a long-shot curiosity at best to the unquestionably dominant spot in the Republican primary election, much to the chagrin of party elders. Political analysts dismissed his campaign, with no traditional infrastructure or support from influencers in the conservative movement at large, as doomed to fail. History has since shown otherwise.\n\nThe secret? Disruption. By his direct (and often vulgar) speech, his willingness to attack anyone and everyone (including members of his own party), and his very presence as a serious contender for the White House despite lacking a history in politics or support from mega donors (or really anyone deeply embedded in politics), Donald Trump is the very opposite of the typical political candidate. He brings the end of the status quo, the upheaval of an establishment that has become deeply unpopular. Trump represents an idea whose time has come, and once that idea gains enough traction, there’s no stopping it.\n\nSimilarly, Bitcoin represents disruption in the financial sector. From banks to governments, existing institutions stand to lose out from its rise, whether it be its power to obsolete slower, more expensive forms of money, or its ability to allow economies to operate and grow almost entirely without state oversight. To some, Bitcoin’s ability to bypass government regulators has made it unique and invaluable. Even to the rest of its users who have every intention of complying with all relevant regulations, it is simply too convenient, useful, and powerful to give up once the popularity surge is over. Because of this, Bitcoin’s disruption will continue until it has upended the entire financial industry.\n\nAn unstoppable force can still suffer temporary setbacks. During the first election of the Republican primary, the Iowa Caucuses, Trump received a defeat by a significant margin, and his poll numbers took a corresponding dive. However, he went on to win New Hampshire by an even more significant margin, and has dominated every primary since.\n\nAs for Bitcoin, when Core developer, Mike Hearn’s, article decrying the cryptocurrency as dead in the water was released, its price similarly took a hit, only to recover and rise even higher than before. This same pattern has repeated several times over, as a setback strikes, causing self-styled experts to declare Bitcoin finished, only to see it recover. We can expect to see more bumps down the road, but rest assured that no setback will be permanent at this point.\n\nFor better or worse, Donald Trump’s fate as the Republican Party’s self-chosen one has been written in stone. So too has Bitcoin’s destiny, as the future of currency, been decided, entirely for the better.', 'Finnish bitcoin broker Prasos has acquired Helsinki-based digital currency exchange Coinmotion for an undisclosed sum.\n\nThe acquisition of the exchange by Prasos – which operates a different bitcoin exchange called Bittiraha.fi, as well as a bitcoin ATM network in Finland – follows a trend of exchange consolidation in the past year.\n\nWhile Prasos, which has headquarters in Jyväskylä, Finland, declined to disclose the buy price, it say the cash deal involved the purchase of the Coinmotion platform along with its customer base.\n\nWhile none of the exchange staff will stay with the firm through the transition, Prasos indicated that some elements of the outgoing team may in future work on the platform on a contract basis.\n\nCoinmotion went live under the new management on 23rd February.\n\nInternational plans\n\nPrasos co-founder and CEO Henry Brade told CoinDesk the deal gives Prasos the ability to compete in the broader European exchange market, as well as in other regions, saying:\n\n“We believe we can take on players like Coinbase etc, in more places than just Finland.

02/26/2016,"[""Brian Hoffman is the CEO of OB1, the startup overseeing development of blockchain-based marketplace project OpenBazaar, and a former lead associate at Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Hoffman discusses the ongoing debate over how bitcoin should be scaled, and why the network's lack of leadership may be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nIt seems fairly obvious that in the world of open-source software development that anyone, anywhere can start reading code and start doing whatever they want with it.\n\nBut, where it gets complicated is when that modified code wants to come back into the source repository. When a programmer starts to actually engage the project community with any ideas or code contributions that reaction can range from admiration and acceptance all the way to flat out denigration.\n\nThat’s because every project has a certain culture that is created by it's members and cultivated by the project's leader or leaders.\n\nBut, what happens if that project has no leader?\n\nAn airplane with no pilot surely crashes into the ground or ocean. But open-source projects are not run by machines that simply fail, they are more resilient and, just like a country whose leadership has been forcibly removed, a vacuum is created and a power struggle emerges when there is no one at the top.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin and stayed around long enough to ensure it was in good hands and making progress. Or maybe he or she didn't. Maybe they left for other reasons.\n\nRegardless of his or her motivations for moving on, the bitcoin community was left searching for the next Satoshi to tell us exactly what should happen next and we’ve spent the last several years trying to tell each other what Satoshi would do if they were still pulling the strings.\n\nCrowded room\n\nI’m absolutely convinced that part of the issue is that bitcoin as an idea is so revolutionary and controversial that it not only attracts the smartest and the brightest, it also appeals to scam artists, idiots, politicians, economists and anyone with an Internet connection who thinks they have something to say.\n\nBut who should control the future of bitcoin? Are we expected to believe that this amazingly diverse set of actors are going to somehow get together at a roundtable or chat room and just come to agreement on every issue?\n\nI would argue it's an approach that's ultimately destined to fail.\n\nWe should not be trying to emulate existing development models, because there is no existing model that fits what is happening. There hasn't been a project so large and so important that didn’t have someone or some organization controlling it directly.\n\nI think that we don't need Bitcoin Core Developers; we need Bitcoin core developers.\n\nEveryone from individual users to miners to the core developers themselves need to stop pretending like bitcoin is theirs.\n\nUs versus them\n\nBitcoin is permissionless so why are we all so obsessed with figuring out who owns it? Why are we giving it to the core developers? Why are we capitulating to the Chinese miners? Why are we getting rattled by uninformed users who couldn’t even read the source code let alone submit a pull request?\n\nThe fight between these interest groups has gotten so nasty that when you step back from it for a moment you might ask yourself 'What the fuck did I get myself into?' I don’t blame anyone for walking away shaking their head or whiny rage-quitting, but I also don’t believe that it’s all a lost cause.\n\n“For those that say a fork is no longer bitcoin, I’d say you’re both no longer bitcoin. None of you can claim to be the true bitcoin.”\n\nIf bitcoin is going to survive then we must not be afraid of the principles that underly open source itself.\n\nThe three buttons on GitHub ask us to watch, star or fork the project. It’s that last one that we all want to pontificate on. The nuclear option. Fork… it’s what happens when you’ve finally decided that whomever owns this repository is no longer willing to work with you and you have no other option but to separate.\n\nWe shouldn’t be afraid to let our paths diverge.\n\nIf we can’t work together and find a way to accommodate new feature requests or modifications then maybe we’re better off with two instead of one. If we can’t find a way to work it out then maybe there is justification for having two separate bitcoins.\n\nFor those that say a fork is no longer bitcoin, I’d say you’re both no longer bitcoin. None of you can claim to be the true bitcoin.\n\nThat possibility ended when Satoshi stepped away silently. It’s nothing but a white paper now.\n\nIf you look at the icons for the Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic Slack groups. You can’t tell the difference because they’re the same. Both groups think they represent the one true bitcoin, but it’s an illusion\n\nIt’s two different windows looking out onto the same green fields in crypto world.\n\nPath forward\n\nI think there is a possibility for all those working on bitcoin to get together and fix the problems that threaten to tear us all apart, because they’re mostly human problems.\n\nWe constantly get brilliant engineering solutions, but it’s the social problems that hurt us the most.\n\nIf we can’t figure out a way to deal with those issues then I’m glad we have multiple teams working on their own vision of bitcoin. I don’t care who you are, how long you’ve contributed, how many lines of code you wrote or who your dad is, you don’t own bitcoin. And neither do I.\n\nIn closing I believe there are several guidelines to follow to ensure a promising future for bitcoin:\n\nDon’t be an a******\n\nDon’t be afraid to speak your mind\n\nDon’t let others stifle your innovation or your excitement\n\nWrite code\n\nRealize you don’t know everything (no matter who you are)\n\nUse your bitcoin so you understand what it is and what it isn’t\n\nWork together, not against.\n\nIf we can make progress on these guidelines and learn to shut out the noise, I know we can prove to the world that bitcoin isn’t just an experiment resigned to failure and plagued with infighting.\n\nThis article was reprinted with permission from Brian Hoffman's Medium blog.\n\nThrone image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

This is considered inconsistent by some.\n\nBut this difference can be explained. Certain rule changes, implemented in certain forks, impact the Bitcoin network very differently than others. Or more specifically: Certain rule changes impact very different layers of the Bitcoin network. And some of these rules changes can split the Bitcoin network while others cannot.\n\nTo clarify these differences, Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo recently proposed to tag the relevant layers in all Bitcoin Improvement Proposals. These are the four main layers on the Bitcoin network as specified in his BIP 123, and the respective importance of consensus on each.\n\nThe Consensus Rules\n\nThe consensus rules are Bitcoin's most important rules. They establish – among many other things – the amount of bitcoins included in the block reward, the mining difficulty, the type of proof-of-work required, and, indeed, the block size limit.\n\nThese rules are so important because they determine which blocks are deemed valid by full nodes. And if all full nodes apply the same consensus rules, it ensures they all maintain an identical copy of the blockchain.\n\nIf different nodes apply different consensus rules, however, they risk accepting blocks that other nodes reject. Such discrepancy could lead to different nodes maintaining completely incompatible versions of the blockchain, effectively splitting the Bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoin's consensus rules can be changed in two ways. A change that adds extra rules to the protocol (making previously valid blocks invalid) is called a soft fork. Soft forks require a majority of hash power to support the change. The blocks that are produced under the new rules would be valid under the old rules as well, so nodes that didn’t upgrade would still follow the longest chain.\n\nHowever, non-upgraded miners might produce blocks that are invalid under the new rules, wasting hash power. And non-upgraded full nodes would no longer be able to verify whether blocks adhere to the new rules, requiring them to wait additional confirmations to achieve the same level of security.\n\nFor these and other reasons, the Bitcoin Core development team has said that it will typically require a super-majority of 95 percent of hash power to agree on soft forks.\n\nA consensus rule change that removes rules from the protocol (making previously invalid blocks valid) is called a hard fork. A hard fork requires all full nodes on the network to adopt. Any node that doesn't implement the change might not follow the longest chain at all, as it could consider that chain invalid and stay on the “old” chain instead. This could split the Bitcoin network as described above. How long such a split would persevere is not really a technical question, but rather a debate on politics, sociology, economics, game theory and more.\n\nSoft fork changes to the consensus rules without consensus could – in a worst-case scenario – cause a minority of miners to waste hash power, and (slightly) degrade the security of full nodes.\n\nHard fork changes to the consensus rules without consensus could – in a worst-case scenario – split the Bitcoin network.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Layer\n\nThe peer-to-peer layer of the Bitcoin network covers how full nodes share data and what data they share. This includes protocol rules to send and receive transactions and blocks, as well as special data packages such as Segregated Witnesses or Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables.\n\nMost importantly, the peer-to-peer layer must ensure that new blocks find their way through the entire network, as well as data packages required to verify blocks. If this relay policy fails, it could result in a network split where different nodes hold different versions of the blockchain – at least until blocks find their way through the entire network again.\n\nBut as opposed to the consensus rules, it’s not necessarily a huge problem if not every single node applies the exact same relay policy. Since most nodes forward blocks to at least eight peers, this amplifier should ensure that all nodes receive all blocks even if some of them don’t forward properly.\n\nNodes have even more leeway when it comes to relaying transactions. Most nodes on the Bitcoin network today use a “first seen” policy: If they receive two or more conflicting transactions, they reject the latter. But a growing number of nodes apply variations of “replace-by-fee” policies, meaning they pick the transactions which include the highest fees – regardless of which came first. Additionally, some nodes reject certain types of transactions altogether, or don’t relay any transactions at all.\n\nThat said, miners ultimately decide which transactions they include in blocks, and why. It’s only when transaction relay policies vary wildly, or are sufficiently restrictive, that it might become unpredictable which transactions are confirmed for these reasons alone.\n\nChanges to the peer-to-peer layer without consensus could – in a worst-case scenario – split the network. This risk exists if blocks can’t find their way throughout the whole network. The split will, however, automatically resolve once the network is reconnected.\n\nIf the changes concern transactions only, they could – in a worst case scenario – prevent certain transactions from confirming. It could also decrease the reliability of unconfirmed transactions. But it cannot split the network.\n\nApplication Programming Interfaces and Remote Procedure Calls\n\nThe Application Programming Interface (API) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) layers are communications layers on top of the peer-to-peer protocol. Many Bitcoin software applications – such as mobile wallets and block explorers – communicate with the blockchain through these layers by connecting to an API or software library.\n\nIf one of these layers fails, all connected software applications will be unable to reliably communicate with the Bitcoin network. Mobile wallets won't know if they received Bitcoin, and blockchain explorers can't tell whether a new block was found. However, all other Bitcoin users won’t notice a thing; the network itself is still running fine.\n\nChanges to the API and RPC layers without consensus could – in a worst-case scenario – completely disconnect users of these layers from the Bitcoin network. But such changes cannot split the network itself.\n\nApplications\n\nLast, the application layer refers to how Bitcoin software applications create and use certain types of data that doesn’t really touch the network directly, but that is useful to synchronize across applications.\n\nThis includes, for example, address formats, private keys generation or wallet back-ups. If one wallet generates an address that another wallet doesn't consider valid, transacting between them will be impossible. Or if one wallet uses one method to create a backup address seed, and another wallet uses another, users can't recover their private keys with each wallet. The same goes for wallet backups.\n\nChanges to the application layers without consensus could – in a worst case scenario – prevent some users from mutually transacting, and cause other inconveniences. Such changes cannot split the network. Thanks go out to Lombrozo for technical guidance."", 'There\'s a new buzzword emerging in the energy industry: blockchain.\n\nBlockchain is commonly known as the public database created to track the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. It chronologically records and links every transaction made across the network, making Bitcoin more secure and keeping authentications decentralized. Blockchain is the reason Bitcoin can exist and transactions using it can be trusted.\n\nBut the blockchain concept isn\'t limited to Bitcoin. Experts are now asking if it can be used to track the flow of electrons on a distributed grid.\n\nIf the future two-way electric system is made up of billions of endpoints interacting with each other -- microgrids, solar systems, smart appliances, in-field distributed computing and energy management software -- how do you create a secure system that can verify instantaneous, autonomous transactions across these nodes as market conditions change?\n\nMany people believe that the blockchain can serve as the foundation of this system.\n\n""Bitcoin is largely changing finance. But moving into blockchain energy could be much bigger than Bitcoin,"" said Lawrence Orsini, the founder of LO3 Energy, a company building an ""open-source, cryptographically secure"" blockchain to manage transactions across a microgrid.\n\nOrsini joined a group of other blockchain enthusiasts and energy professionals at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) this week to discuss how the concept could be applied to the energy system -- primarily the fast-changing electric grid. The conversation was moderated by GTM CEO Scott Clavenna.\n\nAside from some early demonstrations, the applicability of blockchain on the electric grid is largely theoretical. At this stage, a few early participants are designing authentication systems specifically for energy and appliances. But mostly, people are trying to wrap their heads around where the blockchain could be applied -- and how to get it started.\n\n""It\'s quite early. But I\'ve been looking at the blockchain for about four years, and I\'ve realized its potential implications across many industries, including energy,"" said Chris Taylor, a senior dispatcher at NRG, setting up the night\'s conversation. ""We are on the ground floor of one of the most significant transitions in human history.""\n\nIn a December piece published by the Deloitte University Press on how blockchain is moving into other industries, David Schatsky and Craig Muraskin offered a clear explanation for why it\'s such an attractive concept: ""Blockchain technology offers a way of recording transactions or any digital interaction in a way that is designed to be secure, transparent, highly resistant to outages, auditable, and efficient; as such, it carries the possibility of disrupting industries such as financial services, remaking business practices such as accounting and auditing, and enabling new business models.""\n\nEnergy is one of those industries that could be transformed by blockchain, argues a growing group of believers. (Although Schatsky and Muraskin point out that ""there is little concrete happening"" in energy at the moment.)\n\nThat hasn\'t stopped experts from dreaming and experimenting.\n\n""We can turn Bitcoin into almost anything,"" said Joi Ito, the director of MIT\'s media lab, speaking on a panel of energy and blockchain experts.\n\nLO3 Energy has already built out two nodes that are collecting consumption and generation data across the microgrid and ""feeding it into a blockchain,"" said Orsini.\n\n""They\'re not quite ready for prime time, but [the nodes] are up and running,"" he said.\n\nIn January, IBM and Samsung unveiled an early platform for controlling connected devices based on the blockchain concept, called ADEPT. The platform uses software developed by Ethereum that authenticates ""smart contracts."" Those ""contracts"" could be micro-transactions between appliances within a home as they react instantaneously and autonomously to changing conditions on the grid, for example.\n\nPaul Brody, the leader of Ernst & Young\'s technology strategy arm, called this ""device democracy.""\n\n“We demonstrate how, using ADEPT, a humble washer can become a semi-autonomous device capable of managing its own consumables supply, performing self-service and maintenance, and even negotiating with other peer devices both in the home and outside to optimize its environment,"" wrote IBM in a draft white paper on device democracy. (The final white paper can be found here.)\n\nBrody formerly worked at IBM and helped build the ADEPT platform. ""We needed a completely new way to manage connected devices for the internet of things,"" he said. Blockchain was the place to start.\n\nIn the future, all smart devices across a network -- perhaps connected by ADEPT -- will be able to securely send and receive data while autonomously reacting to market signals. And this will all be hidden to the average consumer, said Brody.\n\n""Most consumers will not know or care if their appliances run on blockchain. If I have to think about every trillionth of a kilowatt-hour I\'ve saved, it\'s never going to happen,"" he said.\n\nAlong with LO3 Energy and IBM, a Vienna-based startup called Grid Singularity is also experimenting with blockchain to authenticate energy transactions. The company is targeting developing countries, where it wants to make pay-as-you-go solar more secure. Its eventual goal is to build a blockchain platform for energy systems that can be applied to any type of transaction on the grid.\n\nEd Hesse, the co-founder and CEO of Grid Singularity, doesn\'t see other platforms as full-on competitors yet. ""I don’t see one universal blockchain. I see many different blockchains that overlap,"" said Hesse.\n\nBitcoin proved blockchain can work. Now investors, startups and behemoths like IBM are investing real money to test how it could be applied to energy and the broader internet of things. So how would blockchain be adopted in those sectors?\n\nNo one had a precise answer. Perhaps in smart meters first, then in appliances, and then across a microgrid. There are currently far more theories and proposals than real-world examples.\n\nAnd while regulators might like the idea of using blockchain to help monitor the grid of the future, they haven\'t even begun to grapple with how to support it.\n\n""You’re going to see a lot of fumbling in the dark until someone finds a light switch,"" concluded Brody.\n\nIt\'s still early days conceptually for the energy blockchain. Finding early-adoption cases is important. But all the experts agreed that big thinking is just as crucial at this stage.\n\n""It would be a waste to just use the blockchain to just do meter billing,"" said Ito.\n\nExpect blockchain to become an increasingly popular term in energy. But don\'t expect much more than small pilots and conceptual frameworks for many years to come.', 'Social tipping service ChangeTip has announced a new ""decentralised"" wallet service, citing demand from the bitcoin community.\n\nCalled ChangeTip Wallet, the service is said to let customers more easily use the platform\'s social media integrations to send funds, while allowing users better controls over their account and funds.\n\nFor example, users of the wallet will hold their own private keys, and be able to initiate and approve payments using web-based and mobile apps.\n\n""We’re really excited to launch something that’s pure bitcoin,"" said Nick Sullivan, Founder and CEO of San Francisco-based ChangeCoin – the company behind the ChangeTip platform.\n\nHe explained:\n\n“Many in our community like ChangeTip, but shy away from the service because it’s centralized. We talked for a while about creating this product, and ultimately, we decided it was something we really wanted to build.”\n\nChangeTip Wallet is currently in closed beta and is available by invitation only.\n\nShift from centralisation\n\nUntil recently, customers were required to store their funds with ChangeTip to use the service. However, the firm said, bitcoin users have been requesting that the platform move to a more decentralised model.\n\nAs a result, the team decided to work on the new ChangeTip wallet, allowing users to manage their own private keys and to more ""fully experience the benefits that bitcoin offers"".\n\nThe firm\'s new product is a ""regular"" bitcoin wallet with ChangeTip services tied in, said Sullivan. ""Your private keys never leave your phone and you can still send tips on Twitter.""\n\n""Listening to users\' feedback and making changes that the majority of your user base wants to see is always a good idea for business,"" he said, adding:\n\n""We listened to feedback, learned lessons, and now we really want to build and deliver something valuable that people feel good about using.""\n\nUsers will enjoy more financial freedom compared with the standard ChangeTip service, the firm said, since account sizes, transaction amounts and user locations are ""unrestricted and unlimited"".\n\n""Now we are [launching] an API that enables any wallet to pair with ChangeTip and receive payment requests (initiated by you from a social network),"" Sullivan said. ""This will be an open API, so ChangeTip social services can empower other wallets as well.""\n\nThe company also explained it is still exploring the feasibility of launching on a Lightning Network payment channel or a sidechain – other technology options that would make its platform less centralized, and that it would ""continue to explore"" these options.\n\nRekindling growth\n\nLaunched in 2013, ChangeTip raised more than $3.5m for its social tipping service on the strength of strong growth in user metrics. However, the company soon found itself embroiled in controversies surrounding its business practices, with community members questioning its use of customer data, reliance on off-blockchain micropayments and ability to restrict user transactions in line with relevant regulations.\n\nSince then, ChangeTip has shown a willingness to experiment with its offerings in an attempt to rekindle the user growth that turned it into one of the industry\'s hottest startups at the beginning of 2015.\n\nChangeTip introduced the ability for users to tip US dollars in September of last year, a move that coincided with the launch of Tipworthy, a news aggregator designed to inspire tipping\'s use case in content monetization.\n\nEarlier this month, it also launched a new product called ChangeTip Contribute that makes it possible for publishers to charge micro-payments for ad-free access to articles and other content.\n\nReaffirming the firm\'s belief in the technology, Sullivan said:\n\n""If you have 200k people sharing bitcoin everyday, that\'s not just \'good for business\', it\'s good for other people, and, we believe, ultimately good for the world.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group which has an investment stake in ChangeTip.\n\nTip jar image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'What’s wrong with increasing the block size limit? This is the question that a portion of the Bitcoin community has been asking almost nonstop since the controversy around this possible alteration to the protocol went into hyperdrive last year.\n\nIn a recent appearance at Bitcoin Meetup Switzerland, Bitcoin Core Contributor Jonas Schnelli covered at least one possible issue with raising the block size limit too quickly: the effect larger blocks have on wasted resources for miners.\n\nIt should be noted that Schnelli has decided not to take an official, public stance on the block size debate.\n\nIn Bitcoin Mining, Every Second Counts\n\nA key point to understand about bitcoin mining is every second of hashing affects one’s ability to turn a profit. New blocks are not received by all nodes on the network instantaneously, which means miners are, at least at times, wasting resources by building on an old block that is no longer the most recent. After all, a miner can only build on top of someone else’s found block after he knows that block exists.\n\nSchnelli explained this issue during his recent talk in Zurich:\n\n“There are consequences with 2-megabyte blocks. Chinese miners -- they are now [for] 2- megabyte blocks, but maybe it will turn out to be a problem for them . . . Every second really counts . . . When you mine a block that is no longer valid and you don’t get the information that a new block is here, you’re wasting lots of energy. If it’s just ten seconds you mine on the wrong block, you lose energy, and you lose coins in the end. That’s why, with Chinese miners [especially], every second counts, and [with] 2-megabyte [blocks], it’s twice the bandwidth you need.”\n\nThis is not the first time a Bitcoin Core contributor has talked about the issue of block propagation in terms of the mining process. Multiple developers discussed this problem in interviews during the leadup to Scaling Bitcoin Montreal.\n\nDo Bigger Blocks Mean Bigger Profits for Bigger Miners?\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin Core Contributor Peter Todd also has discussed this issue. During his presentation at Scaling Bitcoin Montreal, Todd explained how lousy block propagation becomes more problematic when the Great Firewall of China is factored into the equation.\n\nDue to the way the Great Firewall works, miners in China often find out about new blocks before miners in other countries (especially across the world in the United States). Since China also currently holds a majority of the hashing power on the network, miners who are not in China end up losing out on a bit of revenue. This is due to the fact that, on average, miners outside of China will hear about new blocks later than miners inside of China, which means non-Chinese miners waste more resources on blocks that have already been found.\n\nTodd pointed to some past research to illustrate his point during his Scaling Bitcoin talk:\n\n“We’ve done various simulation results. A big one that works out very well is Pieter Wuille’s work where we’ve gone and shown that -- and he actually used realistic mining and latency networks with this where when you look at the situation in China, for the amount of time it takes data to propagate over the Great Firewall of China and their relative hashing power percentage -- people who are not part of that group are earning something about like eight percent less revenue.”\n\nTodd noted that losses are lower in reality due to Blockstream Core Tech Engineer and Bitcoin Core Contributor Matt Corallo’s Bitcoin Relay Network, and it should also be pointed out that Pieter Wuille’s work was testing 20-megabyte blocks.\n\nThe point here is large miners have an added advantage over small miners due to the time it takes for miners to learn about new blocks. If the block size limit were increased, it would take longer for blocks to propagate around the network, thus increasing this advantage.\n\nOne of the original founders of Bitcoin Classic, Jonathon Toomim, also presented on the issues related to block propagation with bigger blocks at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong. His testing focused on the now-withdrawn BIP 101 proposal, and he concluded that the increase to 8 megabytes would not be appropriate. During his tests, he found it took anywhere between 15 and 150 seconds to send block data to another peer when the two parties were on opposite sides of the Great Firewall of China.\n\nAt the Bitcoin Foundation’s DevCore Workshop back in October, Bitcoin Core Developer Gregory Maxwell explained that the second-to-last mining pool to learn about a new block is currently dealing with a 5 percent orphan rate.\n\nOn a related note, there’s a theorized vulnerability in Bitcoin mining, known as selfish mining, where a miner may decide to not let others know about a block they found in order to give themselves a head start on finding the next block.\n\nPossible Solutions to Block Propagation Issues\n\nThere are a few proposed solutions that could solve the issue of slow block propagation on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Core’s current roadmap includes two such solutions: invertible bloom lookup tables (IBLTs) and weak blocks. According to the Bitcoin Core website, these two features can offer a 90 percent reduction in critical bandwidth when relaying blocks, which should allow for a safer increase of the block size limit.\n\nTwo possible solutions recently brought up by Bitcoin Classic Developer Gavin Andresen on this issue are UDP broadcast of block headers and validationless mining. Bitcoin Security Consultant Sergio Lerner recently wrote a blog post on the latter of the two options.\n\nThere are also other proposed solutions for this issue, but the point is that plenty of smart people are working on potential fixes. Based on Bitcoin Core’s roadmap, it appears that IBLTs and weak blocks are the most likely solutions to get implemented first.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that, as Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce recently pointed out, China’s control over the majority of hashing power may not last forever.\n\nScaling Bitcoin Is Not Simple\n\nOne of the last points made by Schnelli at Bitcoin Meetup Switzerland is that the issue of scalability is not as simple as some have made it out to be.\n\nSchnelli noted:\n\n“I don’t want to say I’m looking behind every curtain, but if you don’t really go down to the technical fundamentals it’s easy to say, ‘Increase the block size.’ Sure. Sounds nice. Everybody can understand it. But there are better solutions that maybe take more energy to think about.”\n\nLike many other developers involved with Bitcoin Core, Schnelli views Segregated Witness (SegWit) as a viable alternative to simply increasing the block size limit. Bitcoin Core Contributor Eric Lombrozo recently outlined five benefits of the SegWit proposal at Blockchain Agenda San Diego.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The event is of interest to traders given bitcoin’s historical response to similar events, rising substantially on the rumored \'Grexit\' in 2015 and emerging as an asset class in 2013 given its strong climb in response to economic uncertainties in Cyprus.\n\nStill, there were periods of turbulence in the latest trading cycle.\n\nThe currency rose sharply on 20th February, appreciating to $443.02 by 18:00 (UTC), up from $421.33 at 00:00 (UTC) for a more than 5% gain. Bitcoin also climbed the following day, rising from $436.13 at 00:00 (UTC) to $446.74 at 07:00 (UTC). However, by 14:00 (UTC), the digital currency had fallen to $429.99.\n\nThis price turbulence continued later in the week, as bitcoin dropped from $423.34 at 00:00 (UTC) on 24th February to $411.77 at 05:00 (UTC). The digital currency quickly recovered from this dip, rising to $424.45 by 15:00 (UTC).\n\nThis compared to the seven-day period between 12th February and 19th February, when the digital currency rose from $377.82 to $421.69.\n\nBrexit fails to stir market\n\nWhile UK citizens have long been skeptical of the EU, the tension surrounding the country’s participation in the political and economic partnership has thus far not been strong enough for the nation to break free.\n\nHowever, disrest has been growing, and a survey conducted in September showed 43% of participants thought the UK should remain in the EU and 40% believed the nation should leave. A separate poll done in February indicated 38% of respondents wanted to exit the 28-nation partnership, while 37% wanted to stay.\n\nNow, the nation is looking ahead to June 23, when voters will go to the polls and participate in a referendum to decide whether the nation stays in the EU or goes its own way. The anticipation surrounding this event has created significant uncertainty, which may be providing tailwinds for bitcoin prices.\n\nIn times of market turmoil, bitcoin frequently enjoys a bump in price, as some consider it a safe haven. While the chance the UK might leave is likely placing upward pressure on the digital currency’s price, a Brexit would probably fuel sharper gains.\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of digital currency exchange BitMEX, commented on how this event could affect bitcoin prices, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""If by June the odds of Brexit occurring are substantial, we could see a Grexit sized pump in the bitcoin price.""\n\nHard fork uncertainty lingers\n\nAnother high-profile matter that is coinciding with bitcoin’s price volatility is ongoing debate on how the bitcoin network should be scaled, which has been creating substantial uncertainty for the digital currency’s future.\n\nEarlier this week, developers and representatives of the bitcoin industry arrived at an agreement to keep working on Segregated Witness, a proposed change to bitcoin’s code, as a soft fork, with the goal of a hard fork to increase capacity in 2017.\n\nWhile advocates maintain that the plan would increase the capacity of blocks in the bitcoin network to as much as 4MB, Brian Armstrong, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin wallet and exchange service Coinbase, has been highly critical of the plan, writing in a blog post that it would not do enough to increase capacity.\n\nArmstrong is one a number of proponents of Bitcoin Classic, a proposal that would attempt to execute a hard fork sooner, a development some fear could split the network, creating two separate classes of tradable bitcoins.\n\nNo matter how bitcoin’s stakeholders decide to organize, there will be challenges involved. Currently, the network is highly decentralized, which could be fueling inaction.\n\nTim Enneking, the chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, a digital currency-focused hedge fund, spoke to this uncertainty, telling CoinDesk bitcoin is a ""pure democracy"" and predicting that ""the bitcoin community is going to wait until the last minute and then compromise"" on the hard fork.\n\nHe stated that market optimism regarding addressing the hard fork helped fuel rising bitcoin prices, but the cause of this improvement was a press release stating the matter would be addressed. Later, the price pulled back 5% because no real progress has been made.\n\nWhile this volatility may seem undesirable to some, Enneking emphasized that it provides trading opportunities.\n\nCharles L.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Financial regulators in Japan proposed the recognition of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as legitimate methods of payment on par with fiat money.\n\nOn the 23rd of February the Financial Services Agency of Japan submitted legislative revisions that would see Bitcoin and other virtual currencies recognised as legitimate currencies.\n\nThis has come about as a result of realizing that virtual currencies essentially fulfil the nation’s definition of the functions of a currency.\n\nExchanges will need to register\n\nCurrently, virtual currencies are recognised as ‘objects’, as such they do not have the same status and are not treated the same as fiat currencies. It also means that they are not subject to any regulation by the Japanese authorities or otherwise.\n\nThe submission date for these changes has been set as the current ordinary ‘Diet’ session. The hope is that these changes will be passed before the current term ends. However, the predicted result of the decision is mostly unknown.\n\nIf the new proposed definition passes, virtual currencies must serve as a medium of exchange, i.e. they can be used for the purchase of goods and services. Those who choose to do so must also be able to exchange the virtual currencies for legal tender through purchases or trades with an unspecified partner.\n\nAll institutions that deal in the business of virtual currencies, i.e. all exchanges and bitcoin businesses, would need to register with the Financial Services Agency to ensure tighter oversight from the agency over the virtual economy.\n\nConsumer Protection\n\nMostly this has come about as a result of the 2014 collapse of the world’s largest bitcoin exchange at the time, Mt.Gox, as it greatly exposed the lack of consumer protection in the industry and highlighted other issues consumers had been having with missing funds despite deposits.\n\nThe hope is that these steps will create a legal framework upon which virtual currencies will be able to spread more quickly and safely, that there will be strengthened consumer protection, and spurred growth in the virtual economy and the financial technology sector.\n\n“Right way to go”\n\nTomonori Kanda, a financial affairs official at the governing Liberal Democratic party, said:\n\n“There is a long way to go...But we have discussed reform and believe it is the right way to go.”\n\nAnother Financial Services Agency official in Tokyo echoed Mr Kanda’s statement, but chose to remain anonymous on account of the sensitive nature of the subject:\n\n“We have not decided anything yet...The way things work here is that any change would have to be approved by parliament first, and then we would work on writing the legislation.”\n\nOleg Khovayko, lead developer at Emercoin, spoke to CoinTelegraph and offered his opinion on the proposed legislation:\n\n“Any way of legitimization is good, since it will make definitions and transparent rules for crypto-related business.”\n\nHowever, he also added that he feels that it is not important whether cryptocurrencies are treated as currencies, as is proposed in Japan, or as commodities, as is the case in the US. He feels that it is more important that governments show the correct manner in which cryptocurrencies should be treated, thereby allowing for correct accounting of these assets.', 'The future belongs to cloud mining, say experts interviewed by CoinTelegraph.\n\nNowadays, Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency used as an alternative to traditional payment systems. All Bitcoin transactions must be verified by miners, in a process called mining.\n\nThis process is done by a software that accesses the CPU’s processing capacity to solve transaction-related algorithms. Originally, bitcoin mining was conducted on the CPUs of individual computers. Nowadays, to have enough processing power, that is done in big data centers.\n\nNot everyone can own a big data center, obviously, and that’s why recently a new type of mining started to gain popularity, cloud mining.\n\nCloud mining allows users, instead of using their own machines, to buy mining power of the hardware placed in remote data centres. All bitcoin mining is done in the cloud, without any offline hassle, such as electricity, hosting issues, or installation and upkeep trouble.\n\nLow cost of entry and minimal risks\n\nCloud mining offers a mining system with a low cost of entry, minimal risks, and expenses, it is opposite to traditional models of mining that involve procurement, maintenance and configuration of highly specialized hardware.\n\nTraditional mining, in fact, needs “to maintain the frequency of “closing” blocks atten-minute mark. Increasing number of miners results in difficulty growth - the block is processed within 10 minutes; a number of miners decreases followed by the drop of difficulty and the close time of a block still takes 10 minutes”, commented marketing expert at HashFlare Alexander Gromov.\n\nThe reasons for cloud mining being a current trend are many and we had the chance to find out more about them in a recent interview with Mr.Gromov:\n\n“Cloud mining allows to hire specialized equipments and a team of professionals to maintain them, so you are not limited by the capacity of a real miner; you can get your hashrate immediately, without any need to wait for delivery; you don’t need to care about servicing of equipment and replacement of broken parts”.\n\nHashFlare seems to be a simple way to earn bitcoins from cloud mining, as all you need to do is sign into the project, choose the hashrate according to the size of your investments, and pay for it by any means available. 24 hours later, you will receive and be able to withdraw the profit (the minimal amount is 0.0004 BTC, since the commission fee is 0.0003 BTC).\n\nHashFlare provides only two types of contracts currently: SHA-256 and Scrypt. So, how can bitcoin fans choose between them?\n\n“The first one is used for bitcoin mining, whereas the second one is used for Litecoin mining. It is difficult to tell which one of these contracts is more profitable since market prices are constantly changing. Expected time before payback is about 7 to 10 months, and thereafter the cloud will work exclusively for profit”, answered Edgar Bers.\n\nStarting from February 16, HashFlare has launched a preorder of ETHASH that is used to mine Ethereum. If you tune into the preorder before March 21, you will get a 12% discount.\n\nComparison with others\n\nCurrently there are a lot of cloud mining services so we decided to compare some of these platforms:\n\nGenesis Mining\n\nGenesis Mining is one of the most famous cloud mining providers around the world.\n\nA bitcoin mining contract with Genesis Mining costs $15.99 at the beginning. If you want to invest greater amounts of money, you can buy 1000 GHS (Platinum) for $779, or 10,000 GHS (Diamond) which is worth $7699.\n\nIt is a very simple platform as you just have to sign up, fund your account, and pick the mining plan that corresponds to your needs. Of course they provide a system of 2-factor authentication and they always upgrade their Scrypt Hashrate for free.\n\nSkyCoinLabs\n\nSkycoinlabs allows bitcoin, altcoin, and litecoin cloud mining with one year contracts. It is also possible to include dogecoin, which will be mined via the cloud. Skycoinlabs costs $5.99 for every Bitcoin mining GH/s or you can get 100GH/s mining cloud power going for $599. The cheapest contracts are the litecoins, which go from as low as $2.49 for every KH/s of LTS cloud mining, as reported on a Cloud Mining review website.\n\nHow it works\n\nTo verify that the virtual money transactions take place in a legal and safe manner, a process of verification of the transactions themselves is necessary. To simplify, if a user buys an item and pays in bitcoin, algorithms check whether the bitcoins spent are taken from his wallet, avoiding the phenomenon called double spending.\n\nThis verification, that with the spread of bitcoin always requires more computing power, is called mining. The so-called miners provide the computing power of their computer to run these verification. In return, they receive free bitcoin, until bitcoin reaches 21 million units (roughly), as its total number is limited.\n\n“Cryptocurrency mining is the process of finding solutions to compose blocks in the blockchain. Blocks consist of transactions that bitcoin netizens conduct with each other, and the blockchain is a groundbreaking technology of secure financial transactions, which, incidentally, is already being extensively adopted not only by banks, but also by some government structures. Whenever a miner or a mining pool closes the block forming the sequence of transactions, they get 25 bitcoins”, commented customer service expert at HashFlare, Edgar Bers.', 'The Omni Foundation, developers behind the Omni Layer, the largest asset layer built on top of and secured by the Bitcoin blockchain have released OmniDex 1.0. The developers proclaim it as the “first true decentralized” cryptocurrency exchange. OmniDex also allows for the trustless exchange of assets between five of the top 25 crypto assets, with no counterparty risk.\n\nWith no human component and complete automation, OmniDex 1.0 sees the launch of a completely trustless cryptocurrency exchange, in contrast to centralized exchanges such as the now-defunct MtGox as well as leading exchanges like Coinbase and BitStamp.\n\nThe exchange enables the cryptographically-secure buying and selling of several digital tokens that are currently built on the Omni platform. The Omni platform is a software layer built on top of the most popular, most audited and most secure blockchain of them all, that Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSpeaking to CCN, Omni board member Patrick Dugan explained what makes OmniDex the first ‘true’ decentralized exchange and how it differs from other existing decentralized exchanges. He stated:\n\nOther decentralized exchange protocols are based on putting up collateral well in excess of trade value. Omni’s decentralised exchange is based on pure software-escrow logic, it’s as difficult to tamper with as the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe release of OmniDex 1.0 also sees six of the top 40 tokens (listed on CoinMarketCap), including:\n\nMaidsafe\n\nAgoras Tokens\n\nSynereo\n\nTether, and\n\nOmni\n\nFuture versions of the OmniDex exchange will seek to include bitcoin and other leading tokens that aren’t built on the Omni protocol.\n\nTalking about Bitcoin’s integration, Dugan added:\n\nThe first phase of the Dex, launched in 2014, allows for one-directional trading of BTC for OMNI, that feature is supported by our web wallet Omniwallet, which salts your privkey to a password but does not store it. When v11 comes out we’re going to prototype future contracts that will enable pegging of OMNI to BTC and the subsequent issuance of synthetic BTC as a smart property.\n\nDue to limitations in the Bitcoin protocol itself, it’s very difficult to *push* BTC in a systematic way without using compromises like oracles or custodians, OMNI and other smart property on the Omnilayer are automatically pushed when a trade clears. We designed the Omni Layer protocol like this to get around that limitation in Bitcoin.\n\nRelease and Fees\n\nChoosing the occasion of Bitcoin’s 400,000th block, the Omni Foundation began operations of the exchange. Three Omnicore developers and two Omni Foundation board members signed off on the feature activation transaction. This action broadcasts to Bitcoin and sets a target block time for the Omni Layer protocol to begin parsing with new rules.\n\nStressing that they are committed to respecting the scalability of the Bitcoin blockchain, Omni’s core developers revealed that the activation features include the adoption of transactions that take up less data and cost less in miner fees.\n\nThe fees for trading any Omni-denominated pair(s) are 0%. Q2 2016 will see fees activated for the trading of any other combination pairs, at .05% for liquidity seekers, a payment that will occur automatically in the protocol.\n\nThe cryptographic logic is borrowed from that employed in the Bitcoin blockchain, to see assets cleared between traders.\n\nA press release added:\n\nThis activation is the first major step toward a mature Bitcoin blockchain and a world where financial custody risk is phased out. This thoroughly eliminates the problems that occurred with crypto exchange failures such as MtGox and Cryptsy, not to mention traditional bank failures.\n\nUpdate: Factom, although initially thought would be developed on Omni, have created its own chain and is not included in the list of tokens built on the platform.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Omni.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"

On one side, all the major international banks are making a beeline to incorporate blockchain technology into their operations whereas, on the other hand, they are not so eager to offer their banking services to bitcoin companies.\n\nBitcoin has exhibited a strong growth since 2013. The digital currency has been around for the past 7 years, but its rapid growth gained everyone’s attention. The growth of bitcoin adoption also saw many startups offering innovative bitcoin-based financial services crop up.

In addition to financial services like remittance and fund transfer, bitcoin combined with its underlying blockchain technology also started to gain a foothold in the fintech sector.\n\nBanks Keep Their Distance from Bitcoin\n\nThe sheer potential of bitcoin in banking and fintech applications has got the banking and financial institutions threatened. Banking and fintech sector are still dependent on legacy systems and bitcoin technology is something that is completely new to them. The hostility towards bitcoin and bitcoin-based companies is mainly due to the following reasons\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized virtual currency. It means, there is no central authority that can dictate terms on the currency. In other words, if bitcoin becomes widely accepted, banks will virtually have no control over a bitcoin-driven economy.\n\nBitcoin became popular after its extensive use in the deep web marketplaces like Silk Road. Initially, bitcoin transactions were considered anonymous making it the ideal currency for procuring illegal or banned substances. It was later proved that the digital currency is not as anonymous as it was initially thought. Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous at best. However, it still continues to be the preferred currency of criminals and hackers. There have been various instances where extortionists, hackers, and kidnappers have demanded ransom in bitcoin. The bitcoin ransomware attacks still continue to affect the computers across the world. The notoriety of bitcoin combined with various strict banking regulations requiring banks to report illegally obtained funds act as another detrimental factor. It is virtually impossible for the banks to determine whether funds connected to bitcoin are legally obtained or not. to be on the safer side, they tend to distance themselves from the digital currency connected business, even if it means driving away most of the legitimate businesses. This adversely impacts these businesses.\n\nThe absence of regulations in many countries is another reason for the banks to harbor hostility towards bitcoin and related businesses.\n\nWith countries and central banks recognizing bitcoin as a financial instrument in the recent days, bitcoin regulations are not far off. Once bitcoin regulations come into effect, it will gain legal status, which may impact the banks. Banks would rather lobby against the digital currency in a futile attempt to safeguard their profit margins than start accepting bitcoin and run a risk of running out of business.\n\nBanks also realize that bitcoin is here to stay and they have ignored it along with blockchain for too long. Now they fear that they will perish if they do not upgrade their services to match bitcoins’ offerings. So they are now heavily invested in adopting the technology themselves, minus the bitcoin itself.\n\nCurrently, we have few banks that are open to bitcoin while the rest continue to find ways to bury the digital currency while embracing the very technology that owes its existence to it.\n\nRef: Why the Banks See Bitcoin as their Number One Enemy?', 'Ever heard of the term “Bitcoin Dust”? That’s the case when the transactions are too little in monetary value that it is just not profitable for the network to support such transactions, hence a transaction fee is usually levied. That’s one issue which needs to be addressed and how it can be done is a matter of choice.\n\nLet’s say you read something great on the Internet over the weekend and thought it might be a good idea to tip the author with 10 cents, for what it’s worth. Your part is done once you that sent your precious 10 cents. The third party whose business relies on you sending money to someone steps in now. The third-party tells you that their transaction processing fee is a flat rate of 15 cents. Now the author, who you wanted to tip 10 cents would end up owing you or the third party 5 cents! Otherwise, you would end up spending 25 cents. That is the closest I can get to explaining the problems of using bitcoin for micro-payments.\n\nMicro-payment problem is what we are sticking to in this article about the Lighting Network. Although Lighting Network has other tricks up its sleeves, the current issue in discussion is what catches my attention the most.\n\nBitcoin and Micro-payments\n\nMicro-payments have been touted as a great use case for a decentralized cryptocurrency, the flagship being the Bitcoin. But anyone who has made bitcoin transactions knows that it takes time. Not as much as it would if a bank were to process your FIAT money. Bitcoin transactions are almost instantaneous when we compare it with the financial system that has existed for a few centuries now, but the time taken to clear each transaction is gradually increasing as the number of bitcoin users increase. This effects transactions by causing backlogs, resulting in delayed or canceled transactions\n\nBut try and compare the efficiency of a micro-payment vs large payment (let’s say a 200 BTC transaction) on the current Bitcoin Network- now this is where things go way too democratic by the very design of the protocol that facilitates Bitcoin transactions. The transaction could be 10 cents of love for the journalist you admire or 3 BTC that you owe to your company auditor – the Blockchain will take its own sweet time until the confirmations stack up to permissible levels, by then you have lost an hour. And then the transaction is complete.\n\nThe use case we just complained about in the preceding two paragraphs (or so) are when we compare oranges with oranges. The complaints above hold good when we compare crypto-to-crypto, not crypto-to-fiat, for that would be just unfair. This is the area where something as new as Lighting Network might just come into the limelight by solving a real issue that lurks looking at our faces, somewhere in the near future.\n\nAbout Lighting Network\n\nThe Lightning Network is as much part of the Bitcoin network as Bitcoin Core itself. However, it brings in a bit extra to the transactions occurring over the protocol. It offers a better solution for micro transactions with scripting still that of Bitcoin. It is an implementation of a multi-party Smart Contract. Lighting Network is not entirely a brave new idea but a clearer interpretation and implementation of the Bitcoin protocol to ensure efficiency.\n\nThe Lightning network is a novel way to facilitate a series of micro-transactions between two parties without creating individual transaction entries for each transaction. Instead, the network creates an open channel between two parties, allowing them to make bitcoin transactions of any size between them. The record of a Lightning channel being created is stored on the blockchain. Once the channel is open, any number of transactions can go through the channel. However, in order to spend the funds received/sent over the channel, both parties have to agree to the balances of each party. Once they agree, the new final balance will be recorded in the blockchain. It is similar to the 21 Inc.’s high-frequency micro transactions channel.\n\nREAD MORE: 21 Inc.’s Microtransactions Channel, a Temporary Scalability Solution?\n\nLightning Network is expected to reduce the load on bitcoin blockchain due to increased transaction rates and smaller block size. It is not a fix-all solution, but a solution nevertheless which is supported by the likes of Fred Ehrsam, founder and CEO of Coinbase. He recently mentioned about the soon to be launched Lightning Network on Twitter.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Lightning Network has simply de-clustered and de-cluttered the way transactions are processed by the Bitcoin network. The need of block confirmations for each transaction has been eliminated. Now it’s just a matter of time before we get to know its effectiveness.', 'Socialist governments like to keep control of the entire economy in their hands by controlling the means of production, but Bernie doesn’t simply call himself a socialist, he is a self-proclaimed “democratic socialist”. When compared to his socialist peers from other countries, Bernie seems very center-left.\n\nAs per Sanders, democratic socialism is not tied to any Marxist belief or the abolition of capitalism. Speaking at Georgetown University, he said:\n\n“I don’t believe government should own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a fair deal”\n\nSanders says he wants to implement modest socialist reforms like free tuition at public universities, campaign finance reform, and single-payer healthcare.\n\nGood for Main Street, Good for Bitcoin\n\nPatrick Dugan from Omni Foundation spoke to CoinTelegraph about how this will be good for Bitcoin:\n\n“Bernie\'s plans, more directly than others, will require the monetization of more US debt in order to monetize the Quantitative Easing (QE) for the people in the form of expensive subsidies for healthcare and education. So as the centrist, Wall St. friendly QE would cause that new money to flow into Wall St. assets, the Main St. QE would flow into business revenue as people necessarily spend it, and those who don\'t need to spend it, will be able to try and protect the value by buying physical gold, hoarding cash (expecting negative rates to follow), or if they want the full range of financial services that banking provided with the sovereignty of fungible hard money, they will get their money on an open blockchain such as Bitcoin.”\n\nBitcoin’s value always rises dramatically when large economies are in turmoil and national fiat currencies inflate. People are more drawn towards alternative currencies when governments implement strict capital controls to regain financial stability.\n\nBest Hedge\n\nOn January 29th 2016, Ashton Kutcher, the famed actor who has also invested in BitPay, made this tweet that became very popular:\n\nWhy do I get the feeling that the best hedge against a Sanders or Trump nomination may be buying bitcoin? — ashton kutcher (@aplusk) January 29, 2016\n\nBoth Sanders and Trump are from the extreme ends of the left and right political spectrum. While Trump wants to ban Muslims and immigrants, Sanders is calling for a ‘political revolution’ against the ‘billionaire class’ that is controlling an overwhelming majority of the wealth.\n\nIt is difficult to say at this point whether Bernie Sanders’ election to presidency will have any implications on Bitcoin whatsoever, especially since he hasn’t made his views on Bitcoin public, and politicians don’t always implement/succeed in implementing what they promised before election.\n\nTone Vays, the head of research at BraveNewCoin, believes that a President Sanders would be phenomenal for Bitcoin. He noted:\n\n""Bernie Sanders becoming the next US President will be amazing for Bitcoin. Many feel that with his attempts to legalize drugs that Bitcoin may use a lot of utility. However, with his borderline communist views on taxes, Bitcoin will thrive as a way of protecting your money from the extortionists and should become the conduit to transferring wealth cross borders. Once this realization is made by those with value to protect, I expect the Bitcoin price to leave the 2013 high in the dust. I am actually considering going against everything I believe and voting for Sanders just for this very reason and then look to live somewhere in Asia where they actually understand capitalism.""\n\nStrict Regulation Will Fail\n\nWhat if Bernie tries to strictly regulate Bitcoin? Tone Vays welcomes the challenge:\n\n""If there is an attempt by the incoming administration of Sanders, Trump, or Hilary, I welcome the challenge. The Bitcoin ecosystem should only get stronger and more valuable with every failed attempt to regulate it by Government in a similar way to how they are fighting the Drug War. Otherwise, I would consider Satoshi\'s Blockchain experiment a failure.""\n\nPatrick Dugan said:', 'Planning on entering the Bitcoin space? You might want to learn some DDoS mitigation techniques before diving in…\n\nDDoS attacks against Bitcoin-related websites have resulted in numerous Bitcoin ransoms in recent weeks. At least four bitcoin exchanges and four Bitcoin news websites have came under rudimentary attacks in November. The exchanges and news websites have confirmed DDoS attacks and accompanying extortion letters. While Armada Collective claims to be behind some attacks, other attacks seem to stem from different sources.\n\nOn November 16, UK Bitcoin exchange BitBargain was attacked by Armada Collective:\n\nThe company confirmed on Twitter it would not pay the ransom.\n\nDenial of service attack with ransom request – It will not be paid. — BitBargain (@BitBargain) November 16, 2015\n\nAlso on November 24, the Kraken Bitcoin Exchange – probably the largest compromised Bitcoin website by the November attacks – experienced a DDoS attack, as the company confirmed on Twitter:\n\nThe site is under DDoS at the moment. Extortion letter received. Obviously, not paying. Please bear with us. — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) November 24, 2015\n\nEarlier this month – as Bitcoin reached $500 before consolidating and falling in price – Kraken suffered a DDoS attack for many hours. Traders on the website were not able to exit their Bitcoin positions at the top of the trading range.\n\nKraken, named after a legendary sea monster of giant size that is said to dwell off the coasts of Norway and Greenland, was founded in 2011 and is based in San Francisco. The company is the largest Bitcoin exchange in euro volume and is the Tokyo government’s court-appointed trustee.\n\nThe company said on Twitter that it would refuse to pay the extortion. They cite the same reason as other affected companies: that paying the extortions could lead to more extortion in the future. Despite being down for some time, the exchange still traded 3,748.23 bitcoins on November 24.\n\nDDoS attacks are pretty common and it’s not economically feasible for most businesses to protect against the threat completely,” Kraken CEO Jesse Powell told CCN in an email. “You can certainly do things to reduce the attack surface and filter bad traffic but, in the end, it’s about how much of the overflow you can absorb.” Powell doesn’t agree with the widely held belief that if a site cannot endure a DDoS attack without suffering a performance loss, they’re doing something wrong.\n\n“There is a cost to running a DDoS attack though, and if the attacker feels like you’re either well-protected or incapable of paying, they may let up soon after an exploratory bite,” he said. Powell further stated that Bitcoin companies, at this juncture, are not the best targets for such attacks DDoS, despite that it is these companies which have the bitcoins to pay such a ransom to an unknown source.\n\n“Most Bitcoin companies aren’t profitable and we’re therefore not great targets,” Powell added. According to Powell, the most recent attack on Kraken turned out to be merely a quick demonstration.\n\n“The attackers actually reported the weakness to our bug bounty program, and they were rewarded accordingly,” Powell said. “I do wish that they’d have made the report prior to the demonstration, but, they were actually helpful.”\n\nHe adds: “I can’t recommend running a bug bounty program highly enough.”\n\nBitcoin Co. Ltd., a Thai Bitcoin exchange that processed 406.585 bitcoins ($129,294.03) in the 24 hrs prior to the writing of this article, sustained a DDoS attack on November 17.\n\nhttps://t.co/3eKbKWxum7 is currently inaccessible due to DDOS attack. All data and funds are safe, but we hare redirected traffic temporily — Bitcoin Co. Ltd. (@BitcoinThai) November 17, 2015\n\n“We have received several DDOS-ransom letters to https://bx.in.th,” Bitcoin Co. Ltd Managing Director David Barnes told CCN. “[The] last was supposedly from Armada Collective requesting 10BTC.” Bitcoin Co. Ltd chose not to respond to these emails and instead focused on creating firewall filters and blocking attacks.\n\n“The last DDoS did catch us by surprise and our site was unavailable for about one hour while we adjusted our filters,” Barnes said. “We would never consider paying the ransom, as this would only result in more attacks.”\n\nAs divulged by other websites, the attacks on Bitcoin Co. LTD appeared unsophisticated, “coming from less than a few hundred sources and traffic patterns are easy to analyse and filter by IP,” according to Barnes. This is further evidenced by the short amount of time the sites went offline.\n\n“Attackers seem to lose interest quite quickly when you block them and don’t respond to their messages,” Barnes explained. “Our last attackers disappeared within 24 hours of the original ransom request.” Since the attacks, Bitcoin Co. LTD says it has improved the protections on their site in order to prevent another DDoS attack.\n\n“I would expect to see more of this kind of thing, especially by script kiddies and copycats, so all exchange sites should be geared up to expect and handle small scale DOS/DDOS attacks,” the Managing Director said. He provided me with the text of the last email copy he received:\n\nFORWARD THIS MAIL TO WHOEVER IS IMPORTANT IN YOUR COMPANY AND CAN MAKE DECISION! We are Armada Collective. If you haven heard for us, use Google. Recently, we have launched some of the largest DDoS attacks in history Check this out, for example: https://twitter.com/optucker/status/665470164411023360 (and it was measured while we were DDoS-ing 3 other sites at the same time) Our attacks are extremely powerful – sometimes over 1 Tbps per second. And our bots can even bypass CloudFlare’s (and similar cheap protections) javascript visitors check. So, no cheap protection will help. So, your site will be DDoS-ed until you pay 10 Bitcoins @ 1BNiaNQurys86z9gVg2Ke9HNAX7jmQYduD Usually we ask for more, but since you are a small company we are offering you a discount. Right now we will start small attack just on bx.in.th to try to minimize eventual damage, which we want to avoid at this moment, because if we start full scale attack, Amazon will kick you out. If you don’t pay within 2 hours, massive attack will start on all your sites and price will increase to 20 BTC and will keep going up 2 BTC for every hour of attack! If you report this to media and try to get some free publicity by using our name, instead of paying, attack will start permanently and will last for a long time. This is not a joke. Prevent it all with just 10 BTC @ 1BNiaNQurys86z9gVg2Ke9HNAX7jmQYduD Do not reply, we will not read. Pay and we will know its you. AND YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN HEAR FROM US! And nobody will ever know you cooperated.\n\nThe same day, The Rock Trading LTD., a Malta-based Bitcoin exchange since 2011, suffered a DDoS attack. On November 24, the site traded 760 bitcoins ($241,680).\n\nWe are currently under DDOS. Working on it. — The Rock Trading Ltd (@TheRockTrading) November 17, 2015\n\nAnother, smaller Bitcoin exchange, Cryptsy, also endured a DDoS attack on November 24.\n\nWebsite offline due to denial of service attack. We are working to mitigate. — BigVern (@cryptsy) November 25, 2015\n\nBitcoin News Websites DDoS’d\n\nBasically, every Bitcoin news website in the space came under DDoS in the final few of weeks in November. There is currently no evidence that the attacks stem from the same sources.\n\nCCN, and its sister website Hacked.com targeted in DDoS attacks. One of the extortionists going by the name ‘Jon’, sent the website an email demanding 2 bitcoins and threatened to inform the website’s advertisers about the downtime.\n\n‘Jon’ wrote in the e-mail:\n\nPay us 2 Bitcoins now to: 18RJA5BpFe4CGDFQG59jLNhPqYCRaEFng1\n\nadding:\n\n[Pay us now] or we will keep attacking your website, we have only used 20% of the machines we have enslaved by our Trojan.\n\nThe email came from an email account under the name ‘Peter Evans.’ CCN offered five bitcoins to anyone who could help identify the extortionists and lead to a “successful police report.” Jonas Borchgrevink, the site administrator, says the site is still undergoing DDoS attacks.\n\n“We have managed to block the IPs involved and introduced new DDoS-prevention rules,” he told me via email. “My personal belief is that it’s an amateur or an amateur group that wants to make a quick buck.”\n\nAnother Bitcoin news website, BitcoinFuturesGuide.com, posted a message it received by someone claiming to be the “Internet Police.”\n\n“We received complaints about content that is hosted on your website. We kindly ask to remove this personal content or we have to proceed with our investigation of case no 245863.”\n\nThe threat came from an email address featuring IC3gov.com, mimicking the website IC3.gov, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center.\n\nBitcoinFuturesGuide.com also called the attack unsophisticated, providing an image demonstrating a traffic spike to 4 million visits on November 24:\n\nReports about other Bitcoin news websites – namely, CoinTelegraph, CoinDesk and NewsBTC – also surfaced, meaning essentially all Bitcoin news websites were hit if reports are true.\n\nFor Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, the sort of attacks suffered by the Bitcoin websites are not the kind an online business loses sleep over.\n\n“The attacks you worry about the most are those in which you don’t receive the extortion letter,” Powell explained. “These might be disgruntled clients, caught fraudsters, competitors or market manipulators – they would obviously have a motive other than extortion.”\n\nBitcoin, DDoS & Extortion\n\nExtortion is not foreign to the Bitcoin community. Recent examples include a kidnapping of a Hong Kong billionaire by a Taiwanese criminal gang which demanded HK$70 million (approx. 30,000 BTC at the time). Further, Ryan Piercy, kidnapped in Costa Rica on January 20, 2015, was held for five weeks. He was chained by the neck to a tree for most of his captivity before being released after partial payments were made. His kidnappers had demanded tens of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin.\n\nProtonMail, provider of an encrypted email service, paid 15 Bitcoins in November to stop a series of DDoS attacks.\n\nInstances of attacks on networks and systems in the public and private sector appear to be increasing, at least in Australia, according to Australian Cyber Security Centre.\n\nFor instance, a group that goes by DD4BC, which apparently stands for “Distributed Denial of service for Bitcoin”, forged a DDoS campaign against global financial institutions. The organization tried to extort Australian financial service providers.\n\n“Australia is experiencing increasingly sophisticated attacks on networks and systems in the public and private sectors, including the finance sector — if you are connected to the internet, you are vulnerable,” according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre coordinator Clive Lines said.\n\nHowever, as Motherboard reported in 2013, the so-called “Year of Bitcoin,” the cryptocurrency is not as anonymous as some think, meaning law enforcement, and/or vigilant Bitcoiners, could perceivably uncover the identities of Bitcoin extortionists.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'In today’s digital world, the way in which we do many things has changed dramatically. We rely on modern technology for all sorts of things these days such as for conducting business, staying connected with friends and family, entertaining ourselves, and even for practical things such as doing the shopping, enhancing our education and more.\n\nAnother way in which technology has helped to change our lives is through the way we conduct certain transactions. Over recent years, technological advancements have enabled us to enjoy the convenience and ease of online payments such as using credit and debit cards to make transactions online and even using payment services such as Paypal to send or receive money. However, more recently cryptocurrency has become an increasingly popular option and one of the best known ones in the world is Bitcoin.\n\nWhy has digital currency become so popular?\n\nBitcoin is one of the world’s best known digital currencies and has enjoyed huge success over recent years. This is a currency that has increased in value as well as in usage, and experts believe that this is for a number of key reasons. Bitcoin is classed as a safe, appreciating and decentralised digital asset, which has helped to aid its popularity as well as its value. The no-VAT ruling in Europe has also helped to enhance the popularity and value of this digital currency.\n\nOne of the key driving forces behind the increased value of Bitcoin is its widespread usage across the globe, with many now opting to make payments via Bitcoin rather than using other methods. For consumers, being able to use Bitcoin provides increased ease and convenience when it comes to online transactions with the added bonus of security and peace of mind – something that you do not always get when you use payment methods such as credit and debit cards due to the higher risk of fraud.\n\nAnother reason why usage has increased is because acceptance has also increased. There are now many places where consumers can pay by Bitcoin, as many companies now accept this as a method of payment. From eateries and coffee shops through to real estate companies and more, Bitcoin is now accepted in a wide variety of establishments.\n\nWith Bitcoin having become so popular, it is likely that the number of retailers and businesses that accept Bitcoin transactions will continue to rise. This in turn will further increase the usage of Bitcoin amongst consumers, which will have a knock on effect when it comes to the value of this digital currency. For example, Australia’s Lucky Nugget online casino and similar sites accept popular payment methods such as credit and debit card but in the future sites like this may also start to accept cryptocurrency, as its use becomes more widespread. This would make it even easier for customers to enjoy access to a range of slot and table games.\n\nOf course, for the foreseeable future there are many other payment types that will continue to be used by consumers around the globe in order to make purchases. Credit cards, debit cards, and online payment services like Paypal are still hugely popular payment methods. However, cryptocurrency is fast becoming a preferred option amongst some consumers.\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Bitcoin across the world, it looks as though this digital currency is set to enjoy continued success on a global basis with more and more people likely to take an interest in this form of currency.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not represent the views of NewsBTC or any of its team members. NewsBTC is not responsible for the accuracy of any of the information supplied in Sponsored Stories/Press Releases such as this one.', 'Dr Alessandro Arduino is the co-director of the Security & Crisis Management programme at the Shanghai Academy of Social Science (SASS) and was a visiting senior fellow with the China Programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.\n\nIn this article, Arduino addresses China\'s role in the global digital currency markets and how domestic investors and regulators could impact its development.\n\n2016 began in China with two sequential market crashes that forced the regulators to intervene in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.\n\nAs they did in response to the stock bubble that burst in 2015, Chinese regulators intervened to organise a centrally planned recovery. Despite a stimulus of US$20bn that the People\'s Bank of China (PBoC) pumped into the market during the 5th January market crash, the yuan kept weakening.\n\nGold, as the usual commodity of refuge for investors during uncertain times, started to gain momentum.\n\nAt the same time, the virtual currencies that employ heavy cryptography and blockchain technology, such as bitcoin, have increased in value thanks to Chinese investments.\n\nCryptocurrencies and capital controls\n\nCryptocurrencies – bitcoin in primis – are poised to increase vulnerabilities and uncertainty in the Chinese economy during 2016.\n\nThe security concerns for China are a broad threat spectrum. The immediate one is associated with increased capital flight that relies on bitcoin as a tool to avoid strict Chinese capital controls.\n\nAnother concern is over the possible collapse of virtual Ponzi schemes, based on the promise of easy profits in virtual currencies, which are increasingly attracting a cross-section of Chinese society along with their savings.\n\nThe collapse of one of these virtual pyramid schemes, that take advantage of the grey area in the Chinese financial regulations, could start a domino effect that within a few hours could consume the lifetime savings of un-savvy Chinese investors.\n\nThe collapse of these fraudulent schemes, or even the implosion of more legitimate funds linked to bitcoin, could ignite severe social unrest, greater than that witnessed during the October 2007 stock market crash.\n\nOver the long term, several other threats related to the use of bitcoin are expected to affect China’s security. These threats include the lack of accountability in China\'s growing shadow economy, as well as providing an additional tool for the financing of terrorism and illegal activities such as kidnappers\' rings.\n\nJust in the last months of 2015, a high-level case of kidnapping involving the Hong Kong tycoon Wong Kwan resulted in a bitcoin ransom demand.\n\nIn 2015, the Chinese government’s options in support of the stock market ranged from capital inflow restrictions to jail terms for short-sellers (traders who were betting against the market, thus profiting from the fall).\n\nIn 2016, these options are more limited due to the dwindling foreign trade account surplus and the risks related to the possible burst of the provincial government and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) bad loan bubble, which could very well absorb the remaining reserves.\n\nIn parallel with the yuan devaluation, the Chinese online bitcoin exchanges (such as OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC) are experiencing an increased spread in the BTC/USD exchange rate.\n\nA weaker yuan will attract an increasing number of Chinese to hold assets denominated in bitcoin.\n\nYuan and cryptocurrency links\n\nTo assuage the concern of several western countries, China needs to take additional measures to address the unregulated use of digital currency, particularly money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe anonymity that is at the base of cryptocurrencies is prone to abuse and must be taken into account when framing new regulations and policies.\n\nHowever, bitcoin does not need to be stigmatised as a ""terrorist currency"" as it is just a medium for value transfer. In this respect, calls to criminalize bitcoin are not substantiated and could be the same as a demand to stop using the US dollar since it is the preferred currency in global drugs and arms transactions.\n\nConsidering the role of the yuan with bitcoin, it is also possible to infer that future Chinese regulatory policies will have a greater influence on the bitcoin’s global value.\n\nWhile PBoC is currently focused on containing the volatility of the yuan, constraining additional capital outflows and limiting the pressure to depreciate the currency, there is an urgent need for a long-term Chinese approach in dealing with cryptocurrencies, particularly their use for illicit purposes.\n\nDue to the size of its economy, China now has an important impact on the global financial system. At the same time, the influence of China over the value of and use of bitcoin is growing rapidly.\n\nChina therefore also bears the responsibility to provide practical solutions that will enable and perhaps even regulate the legitimate uses of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis piece originally appeared as part of RSIS Commentary, a platform for provide policy-relevant commentary curated by S.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Helen Thompson is a writer for the SWIFT Institute, a forum for knowledge-led debate established by the SWIFT financial telecommunications network.\n\nIn this article, Thompson examines how financial services firms might benefit from blockchain technology and some pitfalls they need to avoid as they move towards adoption.\n\nMuch has been made of the blockchain, the name given to the underlying technology of the digital currency bitcoin, but these systems are not as novel as some believe.\n\nHaving built a shared distributed ledger system 20 years ago, professor Michael Mainelli, co-founder and chairman of the commercial think-tank Z/Yen and emeritus professor of commerce at Gresham College, London, can attest that this technology is most definitely not new.\n\nYet banks, discovering the existence of blockchain through bitcoin, have only recently started to realise the possibilities such technology can provide.\n\nMainelli contends that two concurrent developments have been occurring.\n\nFirstly, people have been coming to the realisation that there could be a multitude of ledgers responsible for a multitude of purposes, potentially in the several billions, due to the expected growth of the Internet of Things.\n\nSecondly, companies in the financial services industry have begun to grasp the fact that these systems are relatively easy to build, meaning that banks could construct a shared distributed ledger themselves thereby doing away with the role of a trusted third party.\n\n""Banks are on the cusp of change, but sadly what is driving them into this space is fear,"" Mainelli pointed out.\n\nLeda Glyptis, newly appointed director at business and technology marketing and consulting company Sapient, based in London, agreed.\n\n“In the past year we have seen the industry move from panic and disbelief to realisation that the technology is real and very powerful,” she said.\n\nAdjustments, however, need to be made to the original bitcoin code in order to make it work for applications in the financial services industry. It is not likely, for example, that banks would share information on a public blockchain. The assumption is rather that they would exist as gated communities.\n\nGlyptis pointed out that while established industry players are now much more comfortable in exploring the possibilities of blockchain, a short-term problem remains in the expense of running parallel infrastructures.\n\nBanks, eager to stay competitive, need to further explore where the line between the technology\'s utility (and its associated economies of scale) and its business value might lie.\n\nStandardisation\n\nIndustry consortiums are beginning to provide thought leadership on the topic, nevertheless, there will be limitations as to what can be achieved. In order to build a shared ledger, one has to share – which makes for cautious conversations.\n\nMainelli commented that whilst 30 banks had signed up to a recent, well-publicised cross-industry initiative, they had yet to decide upon any firm use cases.\n\nGlyptis noted that an agreement over a common architecture was ""not nothing"" and she feels it is right to have API standards driven by practitioners.\n\nShe said, however, that whilst standards are important, functionality of the system as a whole should first be determined before the drafting of specifications.\n\n\'Trust spectrum\'\n\nIs the blockchain limited to certain types of financial services transactions?\n\nGlyptis explained that we simply do not know all the different variations that a blockchain system could be used for, but warned that it is critical the industry should not cut corners when thinking through what future configurations might be needed.\n\n“We need to minimise technical debt, meaning we need to ensure that our chosen stack is not limited in terms of capabilities,” she said. “Some blockchain companies have gone down the route of designing capabilities to suit functions of today, but I feel that this approach would limit our imagination in terms of what we could eventually do.”\n\nMainelli explained the best way to approach the issue is by imagining a spectrum of trust with the left-hand side designated as ‘low trust’ and the right-hand side as ‘high trust’.\n\nOn the extreme left would sit a structure built on very low trust and open membership – representing bitcoin or Ripple. Other examples at this left-hand end of the spectrum include the open public-facing blockchain system, Ethereum. The project is currently trying to build in smart contracts and faster transaction times, however, this has proven expensive to maintain.\n\nIn high-trust environments, on the right end of the spectrum, players have historically gone to a central counterparty or exchange, which typically charge high fees for either membership or associated market data.\n\nWith the introduction of blockchain technology, however, no one body would own the data – rather it would be collectively owned, thereby reducing the potentially monopolistic position of a central counterparty.\n\n“So in answer to the question about the types of non-payment transactions that are suited to mutual distributed ledgers, it is most of them within regulated financial services,” said Mainelli. “For almost all non-payment transactions, eg: time-stamping, regulatory reporting, standing data updates, proof-of-identity, or even asset transfer (with payments separate), tokens are not needed.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Once you remove the tokens or coins, you realise there are enormous varieties of shared distributed ledgers. Without tokens, some of our ledgers can handle a billion transactions per day.""\n\nA tokenless future\n\nMainelli believes that the role of shared distributed ledger systems in financial services would be quite different to that provided by a cryptocurrency system.\n\nHe outlined the possible options for designing a blockchain system; for example, whether the system should (1) be open for reading or closed, (2) have permissioned or permissionless participants, (3) represent a fully or mildly distributed ledger, or (4) have a wide choice of validation mechanisms.\n\nIt is expected that the financial services industry would for the most part decide upon a closed, permissioned system – one that would exist within a regulated market with an identifiable regulator who would determine which players would be allowed to operate within that community.\n\nOnce these options were chosen, the idea of producing a proof-of-work validation mechanism – the equivalent of a cryptocoin (eg: a token) – would seem a bit redundant.\n\nParticipants would also have further options to consider; for example, the setup of a single party system with the regulator effectively becoming the master node, or the establishment of identity systems and voting mechanisms.\n\nEach shared distributed ledger could be set up with individual specifications, but it is clear that systems without a validation mechanism would be much cheaper to run because they would be based on simpler rules.\n\n“I don’t see why you would want to have this huge overhead if it’s not adding value,” Mainelli said.\n\nFurthermore, the role of a trusted third party would fundamentally change. While, from the outside, the system would appear to be accessed in a similar fashion to that of a central database, the data would actually be retrieved from completely different servers because the system would be technically decentralised.\n\nThe central party would therefore lose its control of the functions of storing data (preserve) and prevention of double selling (safeguard), but it would still maintain a role in validating transactions. It would follow that the regulatory role of a third party would remain intact, though the commercial element of selling market data would likely disappear.\n\n“Trusted third parties are having to think about the relative benefits of what they do; validate, safeguard, preserve,” maintained Mainelli. “It is similar to a central phone system moving onto a Skype platform.”\n\nHe went on to say: “The weight shifts from providing cable to building a community to chat with.""\n\nThis means a certain party would still need to hold responsibility for access to the community and would also need to verify the transactions on the ledger. As a result, identity services rise in importance.\n\nA trusted third party would be able to do this much more cheaply and quickly using a shared distributed ledger system than they have been able to in the past, he said.\n\nFifty-one percent\n\nOne aberration in the structure of the bitcoin blockchain is that, if one player were to gain over 51% of the computing power used to verify transactions, it would then have the ability to add on new, potentially invalid transactions. A disincentive, however, has been built into the system, because it is extremely costly to obtain this amount of computing power.\n\nYet if the validation mechanism were to be removed as advocated by Professor Mainelli, what would then prevent manipulation of the system?\n\nMainelli commented that, whilst the technology took away the ability to alter a historic transaction, risks still exist. A trusted third party would still be needed in order to maintain the integrity of the community in terms of preventing false new entries.\n\nGlyptis believes that it would be naive to assume that any system would be impervious to meddling. A blockchain system would be much harder to tamper with because it minimises the amount of time settlements would remain in limbo.\n\n“Once the design of the system would be more or less established, you could then build your security, assumptions, tests and harnesses around it,” she explained. “This process is part of discovery. It is something we have not done in this industry for a very long time.”\n\nNot a blockchain provider\n\nLooking forward, the development of blockchain technologies represents an opportunity for greater efficiency, transparency and democratisation. Reconciliation would become a thing of the past and regulatory transparency would be remarkably improved.\n\nMainelli is of the opinion that overall the banks would not do too badly from a switchover to blockchain systems, because they could still provide the valuable trusted third party role.\n\nGlyptis foresees the iteration of this maturity in that FinTech start-ups providing niche services to incumbents would no longer define themselves as blockchain providers, rather they would simply be leveraging the best-of-breed distributed ledger technology for functionality.\n\nShe speculated that this could prove to be the future tipping point for the large banks – when they realise that most of their technology providers have already moved to a distributed ledger capability, they might as well convert the rest of their systems.\n\nGlyptis concluded:\n\n“We are embarking on this journey because it has captured our imaginations. It is something that can change the way we live and it can actually bring the exchange of value back into the real world [in a way] that we have not had in over a century.”\n\nThis article was first published on 10th February by the SWIFT Institute.

In January 07 2016 monetary changes by the Peoples Bank of China – 0.51 percent yuan devaluation to 6.5646 against the US dollar – coincided with some of the highest volumes in BTCCNY – bitcoin paired with Chinese yuan. @BraveNewCoin reports that Saturday January 16 trades of 4.9 million BTCCNY are the pair’s highest 2016 volume to date:\n\n\n\nChart courtesy @BraveNewCoin\n\nChinese want to bring capital into other countries like Canada\n\nChinese want to bring capital to other countries like Canada. The problem of getting legitimately earned income out of China is not new. In November of 2011 china-briefing.com in their article “Getting Cash Money RMB Out of China” stated “China employs strict currency regulations that are designed to prevent large amounts of currency moving out of the country.” On January 14 2016 Bloomberg BusinessWeek ran the headline “Money is pouring out of China as rapidly as it once poured in.” Some observers believe that bitcoin is ideal for moving larger amounts of capital as long as you can spend it or convert into cash at the Canadian end.\n\n\n\nImage courtesy Pixabay.com\n\nCarry cash for immediate needs, use Bitcoin ATMs for the rest\n\nIt makes sense to carry just enough cash for your immediate needs, and to exchange bitcoin for Canadian dollars as needed at local bitcoin ATMs. This way you avoid most of the cross border pitfalls of bringing cash – plus you can withdraw only as much cash as you need. Avoid the hefty foreign exchange fees.\n\nPerhaps the only downside is you’ll need to exercise some patience waiting for the ATM to receive blockchain confirmations. Wait times at one British Columbia bitcoin ATM were observed as 20 minutes for your cash. Your mileage may vary.\n\nVancouver British Columbia Canada bitcoin ATM locations\n\n\n\nImage courtesy CoinATMRadar\n\nVancouver is the home of the world’s first bitcoin ATM. At the time of writing there are 9 locations exchanging bitcoin to fiat. One ATM in Richmond is closest to YVR Vancouver International Airport:\n\n\n\nImage courtesy CoinATMRadar\n\nConnect with Bitcoiniacs directly on their website: http://www.bitcoiniacs.com/. The Skytrain commuter rail system puts other ATMs in reach too.\n\nLack of capital controls\n\nThere is a huge flow of Chinese capital from China into Canada. Wealthy Chinese move their funds by cash into Canada, sometimes for schooling of their children, sometimes for real estate investment, and other lawful activities. These are entirely “okay” activities. The Government of Canada does not place restrictions on the capital you bring into Canada – provided your cash is legally sourced.\n\nPossible issues bringing cash across the Canadian border\n\nAccording to informed sources only one to five percent of all the Chinese cash brought into Canada is declared to Canadian border officials. The flip side is that over 95% is NOT declared.\n\nThis number of undeclared cash assets is surprising. According to Canadian law, visitors to Canada may bring in any amount but they must declare it. For example, if you brought CDN$ 100,000 in a suitcase that would be no problem – as long as you declared it to Canadian Customs officials at the point of arrival in Canada, and that your cash was lawfully sourced.\n\nOfficial focus on Anti money laundering (AML)\n\nThe concern of Canadian border officials is that your funds are lawfully sourced. Anti Money Laundering (AML) legislation in Canada was recently tightened in light of so called “terrorist” activities. The legal wording is stringent.\n\nLarge cash transfers\n\nIf you are bringing in a large amount – for example over $10,000 – then you must be prepared to supply proof of source. You may be required to prove that your funds are not obtained by illegal means. Ways of proving the source of your cash could be a bank statement, an inheritance will, or a valid official or verifiable document showing the source of the cash amounts declared on arrival.\n\nTypically it would make sense to buy bitcoin in China, then use an ATM on your arrival in Canada to withdraw cash from your bitcoin account. However situations like students temporarily moving to Canada for school, their need to buy cars, buy condos and what have you – these may legitimately require the transfer of cash from one point in China to another point in Canada. These types of activities are normal, expected, and entirely legal in Canada.\n\nLocate your bitcoin ATM before you leave\n\nCoinatmradar.com tells us there are plenty of other places to exchange bitcoin for cash in Canada besides Vancouver:\n\nCity / # of bitcoin to fiat ATMs\n\nVancouver 9\n\nCalgary, Alberta 4\n\nToronto, Ontario 9\n\nMontreal Quebec 7\n\n+ ATMs in other cities\n\nData courtesy CoinATMRadar\n\nDearth of bitcoin ATMs in Eastern Canada\n\nAt the time of writing there are no bitcoin ATMs in Newfoundland, which as the most easterly point in Canada is the trans-Atlantic stopover point for many international flights. Halifax Nova Scotia has only two; one of unknown fees at the university and the other only does fiat to crypto. Your best bet if arriving in Eastern Canada is to fly in to the crypto to fiat ATMs in greater Montreal, or metro Toronto.\n\nKnow the bitcoin rate you will pay beforehand\n\nMake sure you scope out your planned ATM stop well in advance, and have a backup location in case the ATM has moved. It’s also a good idea to know exactly what the withdrawl rate is at the exact bitcoin ATM you will use. The rates vary considerably – there’s no point paying more than you have to – and different ATMs could have different maximum daily withdrawl amounts.\n\nIf you’re withdrawing a large amount you could save by connecting with the local ATM provider beforehand and doing an over the counter trade, bitcoin for Canadian dollars, once you’re in the country.\n\nNot using bitcoin? Potential consequences\n\nIf you’re not using bitcoin there are possible consequences of bringing cash and not declaring it:\n\nfunds could be seized\n\nsubject to a $250 fine\n\nsent back to originating country, or country of birth\n\nasset seizure under AML\n\nIf you do NOT declare the amount of cash you have on arrival in Canada, your funds could be seized by Canadian border officials, you could be subject to a fine, and in a worse case scenario you could be sent back to your country of origin or your country of birth. If you cannot prove your funds were lawfully obtained they could be lawfully seized as proceeds from unlawful gains, based on Canadian anti money laundering (AML) legislation.\n\nThe fine\n\nThe fine for not declaring cash to Canadian border officials is currently CDN$ 250. After you pay the fine in most cases your cash is returned to you – if you can prove it is lawfully obtained.\n\nThere is some discretion in how these matters are handled. There are many possible variables including how many trips you have previously made to Canada, whether you are working or going to school, and whether you have previously run amok of the system on entry.\n\nA foreign national requesting entry has no rights\n\nAs a foreign national requesting entry you have no Canadian rights at the border. You will be totally at the mercy of border officials. It does make sense to cooperate with officials and to declare your cash assets on arrival. If you are arriving as a visitor, and are a non Canadian, then your status at the border is of a foreign national requesting entry to the country. Canadian officials have every right to turn you back, even if they only have reasonable grounds to believe that you are not being truthful. In essence, the officials have all the cards, and you have almost none. But you DO have a bitcoin wallet, don’t you?\n\nMobile phones source of information\n\nCanadian border officials can detain you on arrival for many hours. Officials may ask to see the contents of your mobile phone. If you refuse, depending on the circumstances, that could be grounds for reasonable belief that you are withholding information and or not telling all the truth. In an extreme case you might be put on a blacklist for seven years. It won’t be easy to get in that way.\n\nThere is, however, NO requirement that you disclose the private keys or passwords to your privileged assets if they do not come with you. Your personal financial assets are legitimately confidential information. If your assets are not physically crossing the border with you, then their existence is typically not a concern of overworked border officials.\n\nYour bitcoin wallet is as safe as a numbered bank account in Switzerland – actually safer since only you have the keys to your bitcoin wallet.\n\nNo communication over capital movement\n\nThere is no material communication between Canadian border officials and their border counterparts in foreign countries. For example, if funds are legitimately sourced, a Canadian border official will not tell Chinese border officials what funds Chinese nationals do or don’t bring into Canada. They don’t care. Canadian border officials do not care what the status of your funds is in China.\n\nCanadian interest in your cash starts and ends with AML\n\nCanadian officials are concerned that your funds are lawfully sourced. If you bring a large amount of cash you may be required to prove that the funds are lawfully obtained. Whatever the cash export controls are in your originating country are immaterial, irrelevant, and are not a consideration of Canadian officials who are primarily tasked with AML duties.\n\nBureaucratic issues of moving cash internationally\n\nWe’ve seen that going the traditional route of carrying cash between countries can have problems:\n\nexport controls at the source country\n\ncash conversion & routing fees for negotiable instruments & bank account transfers\n\nborder paperwork and interrogation at the destination\n\npossible hours of detention at the destination\n\npossible fee\n\npossible deportation\n\npossible blacklisting\n\nGot a bitcoin debit card?\n\nOne other way to move money internationally is to use a bitcoin debit card. The BTC debit card gives you even more flexibility than a bitcoin ATM with the comfort of a known reliable card. Make sure you check that your bitcoin debit card can be used in most point of sale (POS) systems. Not all cards are created equal – some cards have better network accessibility than others.\n\nAdvantages of traveling with bitcoin\n\nThe huge advantage of traveling with bitcoin is that you can completely avoid almost all of these possible issues – and arrive with your bitcoin intact. Actually there’s another plus – you save on foreign currency exchange expenses. Your only fee is the ATM exchange fee. Plus withdraw only as much as you need and enjoy the benefits of bitcoin:\n\ncompletely avoid almost all possible border issues\n\narrive with your bitcoin untouched & intact\n\nsave on foreign currency exchange fees\n\nwithdraw only as much as you actually need\n\nSummary\n\nCarry only as much cash as you immediately need. For the rest, use a bitcoin ATM machine or bitcoin debit card to enjoy the many benefits of bitcoin.\n\n“Have a nice visit eh?“', 'Global regulators may propose rules to prevent “fintech” innovations from destabilizing the broader financial system, the G20’s Financial Stability Board said on Saturday.\n\nFSB Chairman Mark Carney said in a letter to central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of 20 economies meeting in Shanghai that assessing the systemic implications of fintech innovations would form part of the task force’s core policy work this year.\n\nIt marks the first time that regulators at the global level have begun scrutinising fintech, a sector that includes blockchain, the distributed ledger technology underpinning bitcoin that proponents say could radically change payments systems.\n\nSo far regulators have been treading carefully as countries such as Britain are wary of crimping a sector that is still tiny compared with banking, but could create many new jobs in future.\n\n“The regulatory framework must ensure that it is able to manage any systemic risks that may arise from technological change without stifling innovation,” Carney said.\n\nThe FSB will discuss its findings in March and consider its next steps, he added.\n\nThe technology Reid Hoffman thinks will take over our financial future:\n\nCarney, who is also Governor of the Bank of England, said the more difficult economic and financial conditions since the start of this year partly reflect weaker growth prospects.\n\nBanking shares have come under pressure, reflecting concerns that lenders have to do more to adjust their long-term business models to a lower growth, lower nominal interest rate environment, Carney said.\n\nCarney said the FSB will report in September on whether there has been a reduction in market liquidity and, if so, its extent, drivers and likely persistence.\n\nBanks and central bankers have locked horns over why liquidity in secondary bond markets has thinned, with bankers blaming tougher regulation introduced by the FSB and others since the 2007-09 financial crisis.\n\nCentral bankers say much of the heavier liquidity in markets before the crisis was “illusory” with insufficient evidence so far to show that some of the new rules need rolling back.\n\nASSET MANAGERS IN SIGHT\n\nLinked to the liquidity issue is a worry that asset managers could not cope with heavy redemptions, or investors pulling money out of bond funds en masse.\n\n“We have prioritised work to analyse structural vulnerabilities in asset management activities and to identify risks that may merit policy responses in four areas,” Carney said.\n\nSilicon Valley’s $585 Billion Problem\n\nThe FSB, which sets global standards implemented by G20 member countries, will issue policy recommendations in September after looking at leverage in funds, and their operational risks and securities lending activities.\n\n“An over-optimistic ‘liquidity illusion’ may have been reinforced by the growth of investment products offering redemptions at very short notice,” Carney said.\n\nPolicies to reduce “fire-sale” risks in open-ended investment funds may also help, he said.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nCarney said IOSCO, which groups global securities markets regulators, will publish by December a “toolkit” of measures to promote proper conduct by individuals and firms in markets.\n\nGlobal regulators will also consult on more detailed rules to prevent clearing houses, which stand between two sides of a derivatives trade, from becoming “too big to fail” due to their size and reach, Carney said.']"
02/28/2016,"[""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Jameson Lopp is a software engineer at BitGo, creator of Statoshi.info and founder of Bitcoinsig.com. He enjoys building web services and is intrigued by problems of scale.\n\nIn this feature, Lopp examines the Lightning Network, a proposed solution for scaling the bitcoin network and enabling low-cost microtransactions, analyzing the potentially daunting challenges the initiative has ahead.\n\nThe bitcoin community has been discussing the concept of the Lightning Network for a year now. It is often cited in scalability debates as a solution to bitcoin\'s limited transaction throughput capabilities.\n\nHowever, it\'s a complicated concept and several parts of the implementation are still theoretical or in development.\n\nThis article will attempt to provide more insight into how the Lightning Network will operate and the challenges it will face. The following assumes you have a basic understanding of Lightning Network. If you’re new to this concept then you can check out this explanation in layman’s terms or read the technical details here.\n\nSince the Lightning protocol is in flux, some of my conclusions may already be invalid or may be invalidated in the near future. A variety of models and simulations will be presented throughout this article, but there is no guarantee that any of them will hold true – no amount of theorizing can substitute for real-world data once the network is operational. There are currently four different projects (Lightning, Blockstream, Eclair and Thunder Network) working on code for compatible implementations, but we don’t expect a minimum viable protocol until summer at the earliest.\n\nSome people like to call Lightning Network a caching layer, but it may be more accurate to think of it as a settlement deferral system. If you realize that a healthy economy has value constantly flowing back and forth amongst the participants (nodes) in the economy, you can see that many of the value transfers will actually cancel out and the net change in value distribution around the economic network will be much smaller than the total value transacted.\n\nIn order for Lightning Network to succeed, it will need to leverage this economic property – but it won’t be simple.\n\nAs a software engineer for a bitcoin wallet, I\'m fascinated by theories and proposals to improve the system. Once it’s clear that a proposal is on the path to becoming reality, implementation details become much more important.\n\nAfter spending countless hours soaking up all the information available about Lightning Network, I’m happy to report that its theoretical capabilities are quite convincing.\n\nHowever, scalability without usability will prevent us from transforming the theoretical into the concrete.\n\nMacro complexities\n\nWhile the Lightning Network white paper is quite clear about how Lightning payment channels will operate, there are still many questions regarding how the network itself will operate as a whole.\n\nOne of the biggest unknown questions is what the graph of the Lightning Network will end up looking like.\n\nTo be more specific: What will the proportion of highly connected nodes to sparsely connected nodes be? A network with mostly well-connected nodes will be more dense and allow traversal of the graph with fewer hops, which will be more efficient.\n\nA network with only a handful of ""hub"" nodes will be more spread apart, requiring users to either choose longer, less efficient routes through the network or to choose to go through the few well connected nodes. If users are incentivized to use a few well-connected nodes for payment routing, this poses privacy issues and creates more substantial targets for attackers to disrupt the network.\n\nHere is a simplistic example of potential graphs that the Lightning Network nodes may end up forming, courtesy of Paige at MaidSafe.\n\nI suspect that the network shape will be most like the second graph, with some noticeably well-connected nodes.\n\nThis is based upon the analysis of monetary flow within the bitcoin network in 2012 that you can read about in the paper ""A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names.""\n\nWhile bitcoin’s economic network is clearly much larger and more complex today than it was in 2012, the relationships between participants are probably still similar.\n\nWill the incentives of the network result in centralization around a relatively small number of highly connected nodes?\n\nWe may be able to predict some of the Lightning Network’s dynamics by examining Bose-Einstein Condensation in Complex Networks.\n\nThe gist is this: In networks where the nodes are competing for being the most well connected because it gives them an advantage over other nodes, phenomena such as “first-mover-advantage,” “fit-get-rich,” and “winner-takes-all” result in network centralization as a minority of nodes eventually capture a significant portion of the network’s links.\n\nAnthony Towns ran the above simulation of a simple Lightning Network that shows how value could end up being concentrated at routing nodes over longer periods of time.\n\nIt seems that there is an incentive, at least for routing nodes, to be as well-connected to other nodes as possible so that you can route the most traffic and thus extract the most fees. On the other hand, there is a disincentive to run a popular routing node because it would require a large amount of bitcoins to be both locked up in terms of liquidity and yet exposed in terms of private key security.\n\nIt remains to be seen where the equilibrium will settle between these opposing dynamics.\n\nIt seems likely that Lightning will exhibit a power law distribution of node connectivity that would give it properties of a scale-free network.\n\nThis may give us some insight into network\'s robustness to failure. In a scale-free network the most well-connected nodes are connected to slightly less well-connected nodes, and these nodes are then connected to other nodes with an even less connectivity, and so on.\n\nThis hierarchy enables a degree of fault tolerance.\n\nIf failures occur at random and the vast majority of nodes are those with low connectivity, the likelihood that a highly connected node would be affected is negligible. Even if a highly connected node fails, the network will generally not fracture due to the remaining highly connected nodes.\n\nOn the other hand, if many highly connected nodes fail simultaneously, the network can fracture into isolated graphs. Thus, the Lightning Network can have some centralization around highly connected nodes while still being tolerant of partial network collapse\n\nAnother reason why the shape of the network is important is that it could be possible for the network to become imbalanced.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Lightning Network takes advantage of the fact that the net value transfer around an economic network is miniscule in comparison to the total volume. Imagine what happens if a great deal of value flows to a poorly-connected area of the network (an “edge” on the network graph) – it would have nowhere to go.\n\nThis could occur if a service experiences a surge in popularity, such if it releases a new killer feature or announces a firesale. If a flood of value was sent to them, then it could unbalance many of the channels in the nearby vicinity, forcing them to either raise fees significantly or to close.\n\nIf the shape of the network is reasonably decentralized, then the rest of the network would remain unaffected by mass channel closures.\n\nHowever, if it looked more like a hub and spoke shape, the network could be severely disrupted. Mass channel closures during periods of low on-chain contention probably won\'t be a big deal because nodes can simply re-establish a closed payment channel with the same on-chain transaction that closes it.\n\nThis situation would be more problematic during periods of high contention for blocks, which we’ll explore later.\n\nQ: How does path discovery work on the Lightning Network?\n\nA: We don\'t know. It\'s a hard problem.#ScalingBitcoin — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 7, 2015\n\nThe dynamics of the Lightning Network will be further complicated by the fact that value transfers will not always take the shortest path between two nodes.\n\nThis is a result of the Onion routing being implemented due to privacy concerns. The specifics of how a node will find a path to route a payment through the network are not yet finalized, thus it’s hard to say what effect routing will have upon the network dynamics.\n\nIt sounds like the initial plan is to implement node discovery via IRC channels – the same way that the early versions of bitcoin performed node discovery. We may also see ""beacon nodes"" implemented which will facilitate path finding, and long term we may see paths stored in a distributed hash table.\n\nIf we\'re thinking adversarially, we may ask, \'Could a wealthy attacker open high-capacity channels on opposite ends of the network and route huge payments through the network, imbalancing many channels and forcing them to close while paying negligible fees to conduct the attack?\'\n\nThis is not particularly different than a similar attack that can be conducted on-chain with a wealthy attacker filling up blocks, though it could be cheaper to conduct on the Lightning Network.\n\nIt remains to be seen how robust the Lightning Network will be against denial of service attacks; it will depend upon how much liquidity is available from other nodes in the vicinity of a ""value flood"" and how intelligent the nodes are about adapting to such a flood and routing value around the network to rebalance channels.\n\nLightning developer Tadge Dryja noted that fees will increase asymptotically as channels become more unbalanced, raising the cost of routing through an imbalanced area of the network, causing it to become prohibitively expensive for someone to sustain a denial of service attack.\n\nIf a substantial portion of nodes fall off the network, how does the network heal?\n\nAs stated earlier, this would mainly be problematic if it is difficult to re-establish channels with on-chain transactions. The question of network health is tricky because the various teams now developing Lightning Network implementations are doing so with privacy in mind.\n\nAs a result, it probably won\'t be possible to systematically map the structure of the entire network. If this is the case, then it will also be difficult to develop tools that allow us to determine the network health in terms of the graph connectivity and channel balances. Thus we may only know that the network is being disrupted if the number of hops to route to a specific node suddenly increases or it becomes impossible to find a route to that node.\n\nThe ability for the Lightning Network to recover from partial network collapse (due to channel exhaustion) will depend upon the size of the network (the number of open channels) in relation to the number of on-chain transactions that the bitcoin network is able to accommodate.\n\nThe larger the Lightning Network grows in terms of number of channels, the less resilient it will be to network disruption due to events that force mass channel closures because of the limited capacity for the bitcoin network to support reestablishing the channels.\n\nIn a situation where many nodes are forced to reestablish channels but block contention is high, the channels will be essentially useless (unidirectional) until an on-chain transaction can be confirmed in order to re-establish the channel with a balanced value.\n\nIt may be advisable for network participants with a lot of liquidity to operate nodes in different parts of the network graph so that if such a situation arises, they can route money from the unidirectional imbalanced channels to their other node in order to rebalance some channels and mitigate the disruption.\n\nIf cascading channel imbalances coincide with high contention for block space, we will be forced to deal with the problem of lock times for revocation windows.\n\nIt has been theorized that in the event of full blocks, we could add logic such that a ""full block"" won\'t count toward the locktime, but at time of writing there is no foolproof way to designate which blocks are full. Blockstream co-founder and bitcoin developer Greg Maxwell has suggested that miners could set a flag, but this means it’s up to miners to agree how to designate blocks as full.\n\nIt seems unlikely that such a flag would be a consensus rule, thus its reliability would be limited.\n\nGuarding against these high-level network issues will require meticulous engineering, but there is no reason to believe that they aren\'t solvable.\n\nMicro complexities\n\nIt\'s clear from the white paper that a great deal of game theory goes into making individual payment channels and routing of payments across channels robust against counterparty theft. However, there will be even more complexity that will need to be handled at the individual node level in order to maximize long-term efficiency of the channels it is maintaining.\n\nUsers may be able to earn a return on their bitcoin by running a well-connected, reliable node and routing many payments through it.\n\nIt will likely be a brutally competitive fee market as barriers to entry are minimal and there is not much to distinguish one node from another other than the available liquidity and the fee charged. Think of it like bitcoin mining but even more competitive because you won\'t need custom hardware or lots of power, just an online computer and some bitcoin.\n\nNodes will want to keep the value in channels balanced in order to prevent them from becoming unidirectional, requiring closure of the channel onto the blockchain – a relatively costly operation.\n\nThe optimal fee schedule on a local and global scale is one where transfers that unbalance channels (lead to a more lopsided channel with one party having more than half the channel allocation) are charged a higher fee than those that help balance a channel.\n\nIn fact, if you are running a routing node and one or more of your channels has become unbalanced to the point that you may need to close it soon, it could make economic sense for you to offer a negative transaction fee to route a transaction that could rebalance the channel, thus preventing you from having to pay a much costlier on-chain transaction fee to close the channel.\n\nA lot of literature and presentations about Lightning Network tout that sequence number-based channels can remain open indefinitely.\n\nThis is true within the context of a single channel, but will probably not be true in the broader context of the entire network. This is because routing fees will degrade channels over time.\n\nImagine that you operate a routing node with multiple channels that have a total capacity of 10 BTC and you initially funded them with 5 BTC of the total value. If you collect a 0.01% fee on each transaction, you\'ll gain 5 BTC after routing 50,000 BTC and you won’t be able to collect any more fees for routing payments. You could still route payments for free or negative fees, but you’d likely want to close the channels and re-establish them in order to continue collecting fees.\n\nThere are also questions of liquidity given that Lightning users will need to determine (and preferably overestimate) the amount of value they want to dedicate to the network.\n\nThis will likely be dependent upon a number of variables such as the use case for each channel, whether or not the node will be routing payments, and the length of time the user is willing to keep a channel open.\n\nAnthony Towns predicts we’ll see something along the order of:\n\n$1-$10 for Internet of Things devices sending micropayments\n\n$10-$100 for routers/cloud computers\n\n$1,000-$5,000 for merchants doing reasonable volume\n\n$1,000-$100,000 for nodes operating as revenue generating investments.\n\nHow many payment channels will the average user keep open?\n\nThis is hard to answer because ideally, it will be handled under the hood by wallet software. To my knowledge, the logic behind how wallets will decide with whom to establish channels has not been explored. For ease of use, this would preferably be automatic, but then wallets would also need a way to find Lightning nodes that have bitcoins available with which to establish a new channel.\n\nIt\'s unlikely that we will see many high value channels with capacity greater than several thousand dollars – Lightning users who have a lot of value dedicated to the network will spread that value across many channels and possibly even multiple nodes in order to facilitate rebalancing.\n\nWhile payment channels are bidirectional, they need not necessarily be funded in a balanced fashion if the channel is not being operated by a routing node. Merchants and payment processors may be incentivized to establish many channels that are initially funded by other parties – these channels will only really be used for receiving funds.\n\nOn the other hand, consumers will mostly establish channels that are only funded by themselves and are primarily used for sending funds. Payment processors such as BitPay may end up opening many channels to receive payments and a few to send payments to other entities such as exchanges, but they may opt to not route payments due to AML/KYC concerns.\n\nAny of the above usage of the network would be suboptimal; it sounds like Lightning developers want wallet software to default to opening multiple channels and default to routing payments if possible, since it would be best for the network’s health. Tadge Dryja has noted that Lightning\'s implementation does not automatically match funding for an incoming channel by default. Without two-party cooperation, imbalanced channels are automatically created when a payment is sent.\n\nThere will also be interesting dynamics at play when an entity with multiple open channels is about to have one closed by the counterparty.\n\nWhen a channel is about to close, you will need to decide if you want to:\n\nTry to keep as much of your value still on the Lightning Network\n\nTake as much as possible off\n\nKeep the other channels as-is.\n\nIf a counterparty is closing a channel and you still have a fair amount of value in it that you want to retain, you may send it through them back to yourself on a different channel.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to close a channel and move as much value out of Lightning Network as possible, then you may send funds from another channel back to yourself onto the channel you’re closing.\n\nThere will be an incentive for operators of Lightning Network nodes to also run bitcoin nodes so that they can monitor the blockchain for revocation and sweep transactions. Otherwise, anyone who is participating in a Lightning Network channel is taking the risk that they will be defrauded by the channel’s counterparty.\n\nOf course, we might also see people using third-party services to manage Lightning Network payment channels on their behalf, which would include running a full node to monitor the blockchain.\n\nYou can give the sweep transaction to third-party companies and as long as they notice malicious activity by your counterparty and sweep on your behalf, you’re safe. You could further incentivize the third party to monitor the blockchain honestly by adding an output to the transaction that pays a fee to the third party.\n\nWill it be possible for third parties to manage payment channels in a non-custodial fashion? This is especially relevant for my employer, BitGo, because we consciously avoid custodianship.\n\nIt’s clear that it will be simple for third parties to trustlessly monitor the blockchain for commitment transactions on behalf of a Lightning Network user. It would be preferable if we can use multi-sig to facilitate updating the state of a Lightning channel, though latency requirements may pose an additional challenge.\n\nOn the bright side, according to Lightning developer Joseph Poon, it is theoretically possible to have a third party act as an escrow agent for a Lightning channel.\n\nHow will users operate payment channels if they’re not online 24/7? You could have a channel that you create for occasional payments and only hop online when you want to buy something. The trickier part is that if you want to receive a payment, you also have to be online.\n\nThis means that a Lightning node that is usually offline should not establish a channel with a node that isn’t constantly online. Will the inability to receive payments while offline result in users choosing to allow custodians to operate channels on their behalf? This remains to be seen, though the ability to run 2-of-3 multisig may make it a safe option.\n\nAs covered in a previous post, the cost of running a bitcoin node greatly affects how many users end up deciding to run one. There will be many complexities to running a Lightning node and developers should strive to abstract away as many of them as possible in order to maximize the ease of use and thus the time investment involved in operating a node.\n\nNew network, new dynamics\n\nWith a new complex system that has its own dynamics will come many unknowns, and people tend to fear the unknown. Some have argued that a successful Lightning Network will weaken the bitcoin network because it will ""steal"" fees from miners.\n\nThis stance seems short-sighted, however, because if Lightning Network allows a user to reduce their on-chain transactions by a factor of X, then it makes economic sense for a user to be willing to pay any fee that is less than AVERAGE_BITCOIN_FEE * X - AVERAGE_LIGHTNING_FEE * X.\n\nAlso, Lightning Network fees will “trickle down” into bitcoin fees. As mentioned earlier, fees collected by Lightning nodes that route payments will degrade the amount of value available to be routed through the channel until it is exhausted and must be closed.\n\nThe node will have to pay a bitcoin fee to do so, even if they use the on-chain transaction to re-establish a channel with the profits from fees reinvested back into the Lightning Network. Then if the node decides to spend the profits on the Lightning Network, this will generate Lightning fees on other nodes that will eventually trickle down into bitcoin fees when those channels are closed.\n\nFinally, a successful Lightning Network will enable completely new use cases that are not possible on-chain, bringing more economic activity (and mining fees) to bitcoin as users open and close channels.\n\nAn interesting result of Lightning’s reliance on on-chain transactions is that a wildly popular Lightning Network could create more demand for on-chain transactions than it offloads, drastically increasing the on-chain fees that users are willing to pay.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin users can protect themselves from exchange rate volatility by buying right before sending a payment and a merchant or payment processor can sell shortly after receiving it.\n\nIn the Lightning Network, users and payment processors will need to hold bitcoins for weeks or months. We\'ll likely see exchanges offer Lightning deposits in order to facilitate near-instant conversion. Another potential solution would be atomic cross-chain swaps to a fiat-based crypto asset.\n\nEarlier we noted the liquidity problem of needing to lock up bitcoins in a channel for an indeterminate period of time. What if you need to make an on-chain payment, but all of your coins are locked in the Lightning Network and you don’t want to close your channels? We’ll likely see people offering off-ramp services in order to solve this problem.\n\nYou could send a Lightning payment to service X and they’ll make an on-chain bitcoin transaction on your behalf.\n\nWe may also see ""liquidity provider services"" arise, probably also run by exchanges. If, for example, you have a Lightning channel open that has become unbalanced, you could send money out-of-band (such as via ACH transfer) to a liquidity provider and they’d route value to you over the Lightning Network to rebalance the channel.\n\nThis could save people the hassle of making as many on-chain transactions to close and reopen their channels, though it does involve trusting a third party to send the funds over Lightning Network. In fact, these liquidity providers may be crucial to sustaining balanced channels over long periods of time, according to further simulations conducted by Anthony Towns.\n\nIn each of the following simulations we have four people (A/B/C/D) who each buy a coffee each day from a random barista (E/F/G/H) via Lightning. In the first simulation, routing nodes are underfunded, A/B/C/D have no income received via Lightning, and E/F/G/H have no expenses they can pay for via Lightning.\n\nAs a result, network activity grinds to a halt when the routing nodes become unbalanced.\n\nIn the second simulation, routing nodes are sufficiently funded, A/B/C/D have no income received via Lightning, and E/F/G/H have no expenses they can pay for via Lightning.\n\nAs a result, network activity grinds to a halt when A/B/C/D go broke and E/F/G/H\'s wallets are full.\n\nIn the third simulation, routing nodes are sufficiently funded, A/B/C/D have no income received via Lightning, and E/F/G/H have no expenses they can pay for via Lightning.\n\nHowever, an exchange (node X) is added, and A/B/C/D sell fiat for more lightning funds when they come close to being broke, while E/F/G/H sell lightning funds for fiat when their channels become unbalanced in their direction.\n\nHaving a fiat exchange seems the most sustainable way to enable channel rebalancing by allowing income to enter and exit the Lightning Network.\n\nTheoretically, a complicated closed system (the baristas buy coffee beans from someone, who buys farming equipment from someone else, who buys hardware supplies from one of the people who drink coffee) could also work, but it won’t be feasible while the network is being bootstrapped.\n\n\n\nIt’s clear to me that an efficiently operating Lightning Network has huge potential, but there are many challenges that need to be surmounted in order to ensure that it is also robust and easy to use.\n\nThis is no different from bitcoin or even the Internet in their infancy.\n\nJust as with those other network technologies, we’re more likely to see adoption if the complexities are hidden from users under layers of software. As Lightning matures, I expect to see it enable new classes of economic interaction and usher in the dawn of yet another economic revolution.\n\nDisclosure: In an effort to improve the technical analysis, Lightning Network developers provided feedback on this article.\n\nElectrocution image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies. Interested in offering your expertise or insights to our reporting? Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'In late last year, Bitcoin surged past the established resistance to rise in value. In the month of August and early September, the digital currency was valued at around $200 plus with minimum volatility. However, thanks to the global economic conditions, bitcoin price picked up. The sudden increase in bitcoin price was attributed to multiple economic reasons.\n\nThe bitcoin price rise was inadvertently influenced by the economic slowdown suffered by Greece and China. The reports on US economy also influenced the increase in bitcoin price. Among all these things, the move to devalue Chinese Yuan turned out to be the major driving force behind increased demand for bitcoin.\n\nWhat Drove Bitcoin Demand in China?\n\nWith the devaluation of Chinese Yuan, people started looking for ways to move money out of the country to invest in assets that are not at the risk of losing its value. Thanks to strict capital controls, the only easy way to convert or move assets was in the form of bitcoins. This allegedly led to an increased demand for the digital currency, leading to a price surge.\n\nIn a brief period, the Chinese bitcoin exchanges registered record traffic and sale of the digital currency. During this time, one of the leading bitcoin platforms in the country, Huobi broke all its previous records by selling a huge volume of bitcoin in a day. While industry experts identified the cause for a sudden increase in demand and predicted the value of bitcoin to grow upwards, conventional economists and armchair finance gurus decided to draw the world’s attention away from the root cause by fabricating a theory.\n\nWhy did they do that? Only they can answer. But if we have to speculate, they did not want to accept that the well-established monetary system is in peril and they definitely didn’t want bitcoin to gain credit for being a savior to those who wanted to safeguard their savings and/or assets. In order to draw the world’s attention away from bitcoin and to make the developments sound trivial, they attributed increased bitcoin demand to a well-known Ponzi scheme run by a Russian ex-con. Mainstream media picked up the story of MMM-China investment scheme being responsible for the sudden increase in bitcoin demand and ran with it.\n\nIf we dig a bit deeper, we will realize that more people had a clear picture of what’s happening than it was earlier assumed. Going by a recent report on Zero Hedge, an online publication that covers cryptocurrency and global economy, many people including Mark Hart – a less known hedge fund manager who predicted the subprime crisis and US economic recession in the last decade used this knowledge to make the right investments. Mark Hart was seen sharing it on an interview with Raoul Pal on RealVision.\n\nThere is one conclusion to be inferred from these incidents. The world out there is not so kind towards bitcoin, for it challenges the very structure that was built to exert control over the masses by controlling one thing, money (finance). And, it is not going to change anytime soon, even as its adoption continues to grow.', ""The Blockchain has begun to disrupt not only the financial sector, but also the telecommunications sector. Looking to discover how the Blockchain might influence the sector, CoinTelegraph interviewed Blockchain developers, Jonathan Nelson and Derick Smith, the telecommunication expert, Lee Gibson Grant, and the businessman, Stephen Rowlison.\n\nMonopolies are in danger\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Jonathan Nelson, a developer at Butterfly Labs.\n\nCT: Are mobile operators in an ideal position to embrace Blockchain technology?\n\nJ.N: The app developers will be the implementers. Traditional client-based apps are decentralized. This is ideal for Blockchain applications. APIs are being created to handle PKEY identities. Mobile operators do not care and will end up getting left behind by mesh networks. Monopolies, like Comcast and AT&T, are in danger.\n\nCT: Which steps must mobile operators take to begin utilising this new technology?\n\nJ.N: APIs are needed to handle PKEY identities.\n\nCT: Since most governments now want to monitor mobile phones, could the Blockchain be advantageous to a customer who wants more privacy and security?\n\nJ.N: Yes, PKEY tech will help. MESH networks need to be implemented for privacy. MESH networks need to advance to increase bandwidth. There is no incentive for cell network providers to increase speed. Mesh Networks will also reduce costs.\n\nThe vision is that people will be able to buy a mini cell tower and join the network for free. They can also be the ISP for their neighbors to recover the costs. I could see a mid-range unit costing 3k.The ROI could be as soon as a few months depending on access in the current area.\n\nThe mathematics for the GEOlocation routing is being created. A series of Blockchains will run the routing.\n\nI also believe that this is critical technology for the Blockchain. A mesh network is the ultimate privacy.\n\nFirst Projects Will Tackle Cost Savings\n\nCoinTelegraph also spoke to Derick Smith, Chief Operating Officer at Blockchain Lab:\n\nCT: Are mobile operators in an ideal position to embrace Blockchain technology?\n\nD.S: All of them are, if they see the opportunities to use it. The question is rather whether they see the opportunities as desirable from their perspectives.\n\nCT: Which steps must mobile operators take to begin utilising this new technology?\n\nD.S: They will probably approach the Blockchain much like the financial service providers. They will conduct internal investigations and build out proofs of concept (POC) around any ideas they come up with. They may partner with one or more specialists in the Blockchain industry to help. The probable first projects will be in the area of cost savings, possibly in billing and provisioning, possibly in identity management and KYC compliance.\n\nCT: Since most governments now want to monitor mobile phones, could the Blockchain be advantageous to a customer who wants more privacy and security?\n\nD.S: There are existing, Blockchain-based secure messaging applications. The time-sensitive nature of voice calls do not lend themselves well to Blockchain technology, but key/identity-management is perhaps an option. There are existing cryptographic privacy solutions like Silent Circle.\n\nCT: Are there any signs that the 5G network will be involved with the Blockchain?\n\nD.S: Yes, the long term deployment of mesh networks may converge with 5G, but that is quite far in the future.\n\nNatural Evolution of the Sector\n\nCoinTelegraph sought the view of someone already in the telecommunications sector, so spoke to Lee Gibson Grant, an expert in telecommunications.\n\nCT: Are mobile operators in an ideal position to embrace Blockchain technology?\n\nL.G: Mobile networks are already embracing the technology indirectly when you look at businesses such as Bitpesa and other remittance corridors. They use Bitcoin converted into local mobile money services owned by networks such as Airtel Money, M-Pesa and MTN Money.\n\nCT: Which steps must mobile operators take to begin utilising this new technology?\n\nL.G: It would be a natural evolution by the telecoms sector when they find and define a relative use case to embrace Blockchain technology.\n\nCT: Since most governments now want to monitor mobile phones, could the Blockchain be advantageous to a customer who wants more privacy and security?\n\nL.G: It's a very touchy subject and must be looked at in various ways. For example, if a bomb or attack happens around you or your loved ones, you would be the first person to point fingers at the government for not preventing such a situation. However, on the other hand, increased security does mean espionage of your own personal rights and privacy.Therefore, due to technology advancements, we put our own privacy and security at risk.\n\nCT: How could the Blockchain disrupt the telecommunications industry?\n\nL.G: It is very hard to say how the Blockchain could disrupt telecommunications, as the Blockchain lives and survives over the telecoms networks, data centers and so on.\n\nThe real use case and disruption is not immediately obvious. Within the telecommunications sector endures across MNO, MVNO Tier 1 to Tier 3, down to the calling card companies and the Carriers Xchange Carrier otherwise known as Stealth Communications. This is where the real disruption will occur.\n\nOn 22-25 of February, there is a big event in Barcelona - the Mobile World Congress. There will be a discussion about the future of the mobile industry and a specific matter that is important is the SecureChain: A Blockchain-based security system for SDN networks. Using Reply’s expertise in the Blockchain technology and Software Defined Networking, Sytel Reply has created a brand new and powerful system to provide security, scalability and auditability to future networks.\u200b\n\nTo the Internet of Things\n\nLastly, CoinTelegraph reached out to Stephen Rowlison, the owner of SMSBitCoin company in Australia. He takes this view:\n\n“Disruptive innovation in Blockchain applications from the telecommunications industry might one day threaten banking. Consumers can expect better billing and reporting services, and perhaps even greater accuracy in news and information, financial or otherwise. Already, the ‘un-banked’ are benefiting from peer-to-peer payment systems which carry simple feature-based mobile phones. Short message service offers a viable alternative to expensive e-banking solutions. Perhaps one day also voice and data will be written to the Blockchain. Just as much as the Internet changed media, are there are use cases to be explored by telco's. Distributed telecom, anyone? One example of linking the Blockchain to telecommunications is being explored by Global Media and Equity, an Australian company and owner of SMSBitCoin. Their exchange services are integrated with the Blockchain and with two major ATM Networks, Westpac Banking Corporation and The Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Thanks to these Bank ATMs and their card-less features, the ‘un-banked’ get cash in or out using Bitcoins and a simple text message. Customer transactions are recorded on the Blockchain. The company’s equity can be purchased through a vending machine offered by CoinDaddy and even traded on a distributed stock exchange through open-source project, Counterparty.io. Dividends are paid to Investors via SMSBitCoin. Since their stock is also traded on the Blockchain, one can make the connection between transactions and profits with any phone.”\n\nIn real life, every chain ring interacts with chain rings from different systems. This is what the mobile industry should take into consideration. With open-minded people, the Blockchain could reform the I.T. service providers and become a beacon of decentralization for the Internet of Things."", 'When it comes to bitcoin\'s use as money, word-of-mouth has been its biggest asset.\n\nThe journey from Internet obscurity to interest from financial incumbents has been a long one, but it started with passionate users, willing to discuss its benefits with friends, and those friends, intrigued by the idea, began to explore – and spend – the currency themselves.\n\nBitcoin, because of its peer-to-peer design, thrives on connection.\n\nAs this conversation goes viral, talk of digital currencies is spreading across the globe, and one community that has been drawn to bitcoin (and the blockchain) is artists. To date, this includes big-name festival staple Imogen Heap and rappers-turned-venture capitalists Nas and 50 Cent, among others.\n\nThis may not be surprising. Prone to fringe and emerging ideas, it\'s a common belief that artists think differently, and bitcoin is certainly different. Plus, there’s the economic incentive as well. As Etsy can attest, many artists are small merchants hit hard by traditional transaction fees, and bitcoin presents a way to differentiate a product to earn sales.\n\nBut what is bringing this group to the conversation? And is this demographic becoming an active part of the digital currency\'s user base?\n\nInterviews with global artists suggest they\'re so far pulled in by bitcoin\'s excitement and mystery, but that so far, interest isn\'t translating into use or activism.\n\nThe importance of connecting\n\nLindsey Nobel, Poesy Liang, and Karen Zahray are three artists, all who learned about bitcoin the same way – through positive word-of-mouth.\n\nFrom a geographical perspective, the three artists span the globe, from Los Angeles to Malaysia to New York City, and from a style perspective, their artwork differs greatly. Yet each artist strongly believes in bitcoin\'s future.\n\n""I was down by Wall Street visiting an art collector of mine, and he told me about it,"" Nobel, a California-based multimedia artist recalls when asked how she first heard about bitcoin.\n\nFor Nobel, both her art and technology play an important role in allowing her to stay connected with the world. ""I see the world as a whole, not separated; even though we have borders, [humanity] is moving as one,"" she said.\n\nNobel creates work that explores the idea of the many connections that are experienced in one\'s lifetime, both within the human body and within outside communities. In her work, she has created a series of neuron paintings, utilizing dots, lines and drops of water to represent the nervous system and the transmission of signals within the body.\n\n""These connections are how everything works,"" she commented.\n\nThe web is as alive as the human body, she said, with ideas and currency being transmitted rapidly from one place to another, similar to the nervous system. Within the realm of bitcoin, she is intrigued by the ease of transferring the digital currency from one party to another.\n\nShe said:\n\n""Artists have always been interested in trading. I think it’s a fascinating way of moving money around. It’s faster, and it’s just more interesting than banks. And as an international currency, bitcoin is bringing us closer to a global society.""\n\nLiang specializes in different disciplines, including jewelry, fashion design and writing, but she also cited the role that personal connections played in her initial discovery of bitcoin. ""I\'m surrounded by many founders and startups. People talked about bitcoins, and I paid attention,"" said Liang.\n\nAvailable for purchase with bitcoin, Liang’s artwork is not limited to a single medium or style. Her cat paintings are cute and colorful, while her exploration of Chinese calligraphy displays an expertise in traditional methods.\n\n""Looking at everything I do, it all contributes to one big picture,"" she said.\n\nBig-picture believers\n\nInterviews suggest bitcoin may provide artists with the element of privacy that they are missing in other aspects of their life.\n\nZahray began to explore bitcoin upon being invited to participate in a money-themed group art show in Brooklyn held by a community of female artists in the city.\n\nHer final piece for the show, a watercolor titled ‘Value and Mystery’, included a bitcoin symbol in the middle of the frame and was available for purchase in bitcoin.\n\nZahray alluded to his fascination with bitcoin’s mystery.\n\n""The mystery of bitcoin is what initially interested me in the topic. I think people may see it as something very mysterious, but it’s so relevant to the way we live today. Everything happens online and it’s difficult to maintain privacy when everything’s so connected,"" she said.\n\nFor an artist, a social media presence can be extremely important in promoting their name and reaching a broader audience.\n\nLiang organizes her various interests, from jewelry-making to her artwork, in a series of Facebook pages. The tools available on Facebook have allowed her to reach at least 3,000 individuals worldwide and to feel a deeper connection with those followers.\n\nNobel commented:\n\n""We used to not want stalkers in our lives, and now, you make something and people follow you and you don’t even know who they are. Now, the world can be the judge of if my work is good or not.""\n\nShe’s excited to see what will happen with it in the future, from observing what new uses it might have to discovering the effects that it could have on the way people do business.\n\n""What interests me the most about bitcoin are all of the possibilities,"" said Zahray.\n\nFor Liang, bitcoin has allowed her to reach a demographic that she wasn’t typically reaching with her older followers. She sees more merchants accepting the currency in the future, especially those that already have an online sales platform, and encourages fellow artists to begin exploring.\n\n""The best way to learn about bitcoin is to jump right in,"" she said.\n\nTranslating interest\n\nDespite the interest that all three exhibit in bitcoin, however, only Nobel considers herself to be an active user of the currency.\n\nThe chatter about digital currencies in the art world may have resulted in increased curiosity, but actual usage still has room to grow and improve. The comments from those interviewed showcase that, while bitcoin certainly can capture your imagination, it doesn’t always end up in your wallet, so to speak.\n\nZahray only recently began taking a closer look into bitcoin and has not yet used it personally. She does have a wallet set up and plans on purchasing some to hold onto, citing an interest in seeing what will happen to its value going forward.\n\n""I will definitely use bitcoin if any opportunities comes up,"" she said.\n\n""I am not yet active, but I would love to be,"" commented Liang. While she is proud to be a trendsetter among artists by accepting bitcoin for her work, she wishes that there were opportunities within the art market to exchange bitcoin.\n\n""Word needs to get out more,"" she said.\n\nFor Nobel, her main goal in using bitcoin is to increase the overall strength of the bitcoin network. She agrees that the word needs to continue reaching the art industry, and she is doing her part to spread the message.\n\n""I hope to bring bitcoin to more artists, and I’m trying to get more art collectors involved as well,"" she said.\n\nTime will tell if the art world will see continued bitcoin adoption, but if it does, it may be an interest in connections that is drawing artists to the currency.\n\nImages courtesy of Karen Zahray and Lindsay Nobel\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Technical and sentiment analysis argue for a return to decline, and fundamental analysis shows that Bitcoin’s value is more fragile than many realize.\n\nThis analysis is provided by xbt.social with a 3-hour delay.

Going forward, technical analysis will be informed by the position of price in relation to this ceiling: if the market can successfully trade price above it, we can expect continuing advance. As long as price remains below it, we can expect another series of lower lows.\n\nShould price fall away from overhead resistance, the downside target is the 4hr 200-period moving average (red in the chart above).\n\nSocial Mood\n\nYesterday, sentimental analysis considered wider public interest in Bitcoin as reflected in Google search trends. Assuming that the majority of mainstreet uses Google as their go-to search engine, the frequency of searches for the term ‘bitcoin’ has been declining.\n\nSocial mood in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it was concluded, is negative. Factions have polarized on either side of the “blocksize debate” and discord is rife. The contentious actions of a few tear-away developers and exchange owners threatens the security and integrity of Bitcoin and renders the commodity money a risky investment vehicle and potentially dangerous to hold.\n\nStore of Value\n\nAn outcome of this fundamental insecurity that surrounds Bitcoin is that speculators and investors concerned with the faltering global economy are reluctant to utilize Bitcoin as a safe haven and store of value.\n\nIt can be concluded that Bitcoin does not, currently, enjoy much interest from the general public. Nor does it represent a sound store of value to the majority of investors and large investment institutions. Had there not been uncertainty surrounding the integrity of the blockchain – the prospect of a contentious and potentially borked hardfork – we might have seen Bitcoin’s fundamental value reflected in the price chart. Especially so, during the reeling markets of the past nine months.\n\nInstead, due to negative mood and uncertainty, we see a series of lower lows since late 2015. Yes, we will see a future rally driven by Bitcoin’s fundamental value, but while the block chain and its development is threatened by contention and strife, what motivation does a rational investor have to buy with conviction in the face of evident risks?\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price remains below a resistance ceiling. Public interest in Bitcoin is low. Negative mood and ecosystem discord has resulted in factionalism that threatens the integrity of the block chain. Bitcoin’s fundamental offerings include a convenient payment network with cryptographic security; programmable money; censorship resistance; and independence from central bank and government control. These benefits require only that we follow Bitcoin’s core rules of Consensus and Decentralization.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto’s sole stipulation is that proposed changes to Bitcoin should have “near-unanimous consensus”, and the protocol’s peer-to-peer design requires constant vigilance around the “degree of decentralization” of the network.

He said the first-ever wallet for Firefox is available as a direct download for Firefox browsers at jaxx.io Due to restrictions of the current build of Firefox, users will need to be running the Nightly (Developer) version of Firefox in order to run Jaxx at this time. Once Firefox adds full support for XPIs (currently slated for the second quarter of 2016), users will be able to use Jaxx on the main Firefox client.\n\nEthereumWallet noted on its website that EthereumWallet by Kryptokit beta is available, but cautioned users that bugs can still exist and formats can change.\n\nDefault Wallet For Bitcoin, Ethereum\n\nKryptokit claimed that since its establishment in 2013, it has not experienced any loss to hacking. The goal is to be the default wallet for bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nKryptokit downloads and installs in roughly zero seconds, CCN reported in 2014. KryptoKit includes a fully-functioning messenger, allowing easy and secure communication.\n\nThe Kryptokit team will launch Jaxx bitcoin and Ethereum wallets for Blackberry mobile, Windows desktop, Linux kernet and Apple desktop.\n\nThe Android tablet version launched this week offers an intuitive, simple, single-page user experience that enables bitcoin and Ethereum users to easily transact the two virtual currencies. The coding of these two wallets for iOS and Android applications are designed mainly for JavaScript to strengthen the applications’ simplicity and efficiency.\n\nThe Jaxx bitcoin and Ethereum architecture is similar to the approach of the Apache Cordova mobile application development framework. A thin JavaScript layer on its iOS and Android application processes all the wallet-side operations according to the Kryptokit team.\n\nCode Enables Client-Side Security\n\nThe Jaxx wallets use a cryptography library on the JavaScript side to maintain unity across implementations. The code enables the wallets to rely on a client-side security model, with private keys being locally hosted that are never sent to other servers. This reduces the risk of key compromise.\n\nFollowing the launch of Jaxx wallets across all targeted platforms, the Kryptokit team will integrate various technologies and software to optimize trading and user experience.\n\nDi Iorio said once the initial development stage completes, the team will integrate technologies like ShapeShift’s instant cryptocurrency exchange API to enable users to convert Ethereum to bitcoin and vice versa.\n\n“Phase 2 (integrations such as ShapeShift) is easily achieved once the groundwork of Stage 1 has been completed,” Di Iorio said. “Our goal is to become the default wallet for bitcoin and Ethereum. We believe Jaxx’s single page design-led UX, easy to deploy unified codebase, ability to pair on over a dozen devices, and unique messaging layer gives us an edge in appealing to the masses. I expect the integration phase to begin in March, and SS is first on the list.”\n\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift releases app for iOS\n\nShapeShift Integration\n\nShapeShift’s integration and the collaboration with its CEO, Erik Voorhees, will bring Jaxx wallets to a new level, by which users can trade freely and with minimal fees, directly from the wallets. Voorhees previously mentioned that ShapeShift will provide improved contract support for bitcoin and advanced Ethereum functionality.\n\nMore than 2,000 users have downloaded the Jaxx iOS and Android apps in just a few days following the launch.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Don’t we all remember Mt Gox, the Pompeii of bitcoin which almost burnt the cryptocurrency to ground? For those who don’t, Mt Gox was a Japanese Bitcoin Exchange which held the distinction of being the largest exchange in 2013. The exchange later shut down claiming its bitcoin reserves were stolen by hackers. Investigators are still trying to figure out what happened to 650000 of the 850000 bitcoins that were allegedly stolen from the exchange.\n\nThere have been multiple reports of bitcoin stolen from wallets and vaults of various bitcoin exchanges and wallet providers since the Mt Gox fiasco. Bitcoin has been a currency of interest for many hackers for multiple reasons. The digital currency is not easy to track due to its pseudonymous nature. Even though transactions are recorded in real-time on the blockchain, associating a wallet address to its owner’s real identity takes a lot of time and resources. It can be made even harder by using the right proxy and VPN services.\n\nIn addition, bitcoin transactions once executed can’t be reversed unless the recipient manually authorizes the transaction from his wallet. So, once the hacker transfers the bitcoin from his victim’s wallet, there is no way for the victim to claim the bitcoin back. At least, that was the case until now. It may soon be different if things go according to Professor Emin Gun Sirer’s plan. Prof. Emin from Cornell University has used the scripts available in the existing bitcoin protocol to create a vault that can prevent bitcoin owners from losing their bitcoins and also help them recover the stolen bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin Covenant Vault and Poison Transaction\n\nThe new vault, developed by Cornell University professor is called a Covenant and it uses the inbuilt bitcoin script to create special transactions. Users can transfer their bitcoin for safekeeping in a vault by using this special transaction protocol. The Covenant’s vault is similar to a regular bitcoin vault with recovery keys. However, unlike the conventional bitcoin vault, this one is more of a savings account than a deposit locker. All bitcoins in the Covenant vault are tagged by the protocol in such a way that any bitcoin spent over the blockchain from this vault can be recalled in no time. In addition, it also allows the user to burn the stolen bitcoin in case both his/her vault and recovery keys are compromised.\n\nBy default, vaults delay the transaction by enforcing a waiting period, giving ample time for the owner to take necessary remedial action in case of an unauthorized transaction. The owner can block the impending bitcoin transfer from the vault by using recovery key. The user can use this mechanism to thwart any number of attempts to transfer funds by the hacker. In a worst case scenario, when the hacker is in possession of vault key and recovery keys, the user can choose to initiate poison transaction which replicates a fraud attempt by splitting the block containing stolen bitcoin. This will then be detected by blockchain as a fraudulent transaction and the containing blocks will be disabled forever.\n\nThe Bitcoin Covenant developed by Prof. Emin also uses Bitcoin NG script and it can potentially be the solution to prevent criminals from stealing bitcoin. Once implemented, it will drastically reduce hacking attempts on bitcoin companies and wallets.', 'Russian Bitcoin and altcoin exchange YObit.net is facing some difficulties with users reporting that they are having problems withdrawing funds from the site and obtaining support services.\n\nFounded in January 2015, YObit.net differentiates itself by offering an extremely wide range of altcoins and allows altcoin makers to list their altcoins on the site, seemingly unchecked, with the ability for those altcoins to be featured on the site for a small listing payment.\n\nThe site also offers gambling services, including a lottery and online DICE game, along with an affiliate program for signing up new users, something not commonly seen with cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nA thread on the Bitcointalk.org forum titled “is yobit.net a scam” includes comments from a number of users saying they have had problems withdrawing funds from the site, although there is no confirmation at this stage that they didn’t eventually receive the funds, only that they were delayed.\n\nAnother user in the same thread also argues that the site is a scam due to their listing of ” fake altcoins under newbie accounts” that results in them making a profit/stealing from initial coin offerings.\n\nAltcoin developers are also complaining about a lack of support and issues in a separate thread, with some saying that they have had no response from the site for days after paying to have their altcoins listed on the site.\n\nGrowing pains?\n\nSomething is definitely going on at YObit.net, although what exactly isn’t clear at this point.\n\nThere’s no suggestion at this stage that it is an outright scam, or that we’re going to see yet another Mt. Gox, although their support for hundreds of unknown, new altcoins is itself a concern, given many of those unproven and unchecked coins may be scams themselves.\n\nWe did some digging into the site and our best guest would be that the problems appear to be one, or a combination of two things: growing pains and/or poor customer service.\n\nA thread on the review site Trustpilot lists two users in 2015 complaining that support is extremely poor, and with one that users who asked pertinent questions were actually banned from the support forum altogether.\n\nOur advice with the site, as it is with all small exchanges, is to tread carefully: don’t risk large sums of Bitcoin with them and only trade what you can afford to lose.\n\nImage credit: YObit.net/ screenshot', 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur.

02/29/2016,"['The success of cryptocurrency -- a medium for making and receiving payments over a network using digital bits and encryption -- is inevitable.\n\nThe reason is simple. The Internet has spawned a global electronic marketplace delivering unprecedented speed, choice and competitive pricing. Yet payments are still made using technology developed by banks to let their customers charge purchases at participating retail stores. Cryptocurrency eliminates the infrastructure and costs associated with storing physical money, authorizing credit and transferring funds between financial institutions in different countries. And cryptocurrency is arguably the solution to online credit card fraud.\n\nDoes that mean that the leading cryptocurrency, bitcoin, will be adopted by consumers? That is a more difficult question. A cryptocurrency must meet three requirements to gain consumer acceptance: 1. It must be easy to use, 2. people must see it as a reliable store of value, and 3. it must be supported by a critical mass of merchants.\n\nOne thing is certain: Bitcoin is an epoch-making invention with a fascinating history. Bitcoin’s decentralized public ledger, known as the blockchain, establishes instant trust between parties with no prior knowledge of each other. Blockchain enables Internet transactions to be executed directly between buyers and sellers without intermediaries -- much like paying in-person with cash. A significant amount of number crunching is required to verify and record transactions in the blockchain, and the people and businesses that perform this service (""miners"") receive transaction fees and newly generated bitcoins (the latter becoming harder to earn over time). Blockchain is a technological breakthrough in its own right that is being adapted to other applications requiring tamper-proof, shared records.\n\nBitcoin\'s advantages\n\nBitcoin has enormous advantages over credit cards. When purchasing something online with a credit card, an account number must be entered, encrypted and transmitted. When making a mobile payment with a smartphone, a single-use token is generated that points to a credit card account number stored in the cloud. A bitcoin is like a single-use token, except that it contains no reusable information.\n\nBitcoin eliminates the costs associated with building, maintaining and operating the infrastructure used to authorize and capture credit card payments. Bitcoin also spares small businesses the expense and trouble of complying with increasingly complex payment card industry (PCI) data security standards. Note that the chip cards now being introduced in the U.S. require new point-of-sale terminals but do nothing to make online credit card purchases more secure -- they only protect against in-person use of counterfeit credit cards.\n\nBitcoin even has advantages over cash. Physical money requires vaults, secure transport and the ability to make change. There are costs associated with printing bills, minting coins, and servicing vending machines and ATMs. While stolen cash can be spent by anyone, the money in a stolen bitcoin wallet can only be spent if the thief knows the password. If the content of a stolen wallet was properly backed up, then the user can restore the bitcoins and keys to another device.\n\nThese bitcoin advantages are already proving beneficial to specific applications. Bitcoin enables recent immigrants to send money back to their families without incurring hefty international wire transfer fees. Bitcoin also enables poor people in developing countries who can\'t get credit cards or checking accounts to receive and make payments.\n\nMobile payments have become very popular in parts of Africa. Customers load money in their phone accounts by giving cash to agents stationed at popular locations (such as grocery stores). This enables customers to send payments via text messages -- but only to users of the same phone service. Bitcoin could expand this system, enabling payments to be sent to users of other phone companies. And bitcoin can be used to top up mobile wallets (such as Neteller) and debit cards (such as Belize-based Advanced Cash).\n\nRather than permitting children to use their credit cards, parents can use bitcoin to give them fixed online spending allowances. Bitcoin is also a good solution for micropayments. Bitcoin can be used where minimum transaction fees make credit card use impractical, such as paying small amounts to play multiplayer games or to remove ads from a streaming music service.\n\nDonations for disaster relief made with bitcoin are received instantly. Bitcoin is an excellent solution for crowdfunding projects that pledge to only process received payments after announced goals have been met. Bitcoin can also be used by organizations to prevent embezzlement. For instance, bitcoins can be stored in wallets that require multiple signatures for payments, preventing misuse of funds by an individual.\n\nSupport for bitcoin\n\nNumerous companies and organizations support bitcoin. Firms such as BitPay, SpicePay and Coinbase offer tools that enable merchants to accept bitcoin. BitPay delivers integrated solutions for online shopping carts, traditional point-of-sale systems, mobile device-based point-of-sale systems and other platforms. Coinmap provides maps showing the locations of businesses that accept bitcoin. Trezor, Ledger Nano and KeepKey are bitcoin hardware wallets that range in price from $50 to $240. Retailers accepting bitcoin include Overstock.com, PayPal, Dell, Expedia, 1-800-FLOWERS, Newegg.com, TigerDirect, Gyft and Microsoft. Companies such as BitQuick, CoinCorner and LocalBitcoins exchange bitcoins for fiat currency. Others, such as Purse, enable users to make purchases using bitcoin at online businesses that don’t accept bitcoins directly.\n\nPeople will only embrace a new currency if they believe it is a good store of value. Although bitcoin has been somewhat volatile, The Wall Street Journal reported in 2013 that people in Argentina and Cyprus were buying bitcoins as a hedge against steep inflation and confiscatory taxes. People in those countries saw bitcoin as a way around unfavorable exchange rates, high fees and onerous regulations.\n\nBitcoin does introduce some new risks. In theory, there is the possibility that the same bitcoins could be used to make two purchases at the exact same time, a threat known as ""double spending,"" but in practice only one of the transactions will make it into the blockchain and the other will be discarded. For protection, merchants should wait for large transactions to be validated, which usually occurs within an hour, before delivering the goods or services. Consumers paying with bitcoin do not enjoy the additional refund protection offered by credit cards, but merchants must abide by their published refund policies in order to maintain consumer trust. And some people worry that government regulations could discourage bitcoin adoption. To alleviate these concerns, former Rep. Steve Stockman has proposed a five-year moratorium on bitcoin regulation in the U.S.\n\nBitcoin vendors can do more to spur adoption. For starters, they can make bitcoin use as painless as possible. Consumers should only have to know that bitcoin transactions are less expensive and more secure. Vendors should make purchasing and storing bitcoins, backing up bitcoin wallets and paying with bitcoin as simple and automated as possible. Bitcoin is strange and unfamiliar to consumers. A little hand-holding may be in order.\n\nMore should also be done to promote bitcoin use by merchants and banks. Let\'s see initiatives to share the cost-savings with consumers, build the micropayments ecosystem, and reward users for reducing online credit card fraud by using bitcoin.\n\nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?', 'Bitcoin wallet providers haven\'t focused on increasing privacy to promote consumer financial independence and safety over the last year, according to the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project’s (OBPP) second edition survey.\n\nAs no provider received a score of more than 50 out of 100, the OBPP suggests privacy work has stagnated within the bitcoin wallet industry and that improvements to these services are greatly needed.\n\nWhile new bitcoin wallet providers have begun adopting hierarchical deterministic (HD) architecture for advanced security, the OBPP contends that many privacy advances from 2014, including Tor support and stealth addresses, were not incorporated by wallet providers in 2015.\n\nThe project wrote in its latest analysis:\n\n""Wallets seem to be mostly in a holding pattern, waiting for their competitors to take the lead on innovating.""\n\nRanvier told CoinDesk that OBPP\'s criteria is designed to ""leave room for improvement"", but that he believes the low scores are a reflection of bitcoin wallet providers and their sometimes slow efforts to address privacy bugs and leaks.\n\nSince the first edition of the report, OBPP has increased the number of criteria it looks at when ranking wallets from 38 to 68 and doubled the number of wallets it reviewed from 10 to 20.\n\nThe report is a follow up to its first survey, released in May 2015 with the aim of improving financial privacy within the bitcoin ecosystem. Contributors to the open-source effort include Blockchain security engineer Kristov Atlas and Stash Crypto software designer Justus Ranvier.\n\nTop performers\n\nBitcoin hardware wallet provider Ledger took the top spot for most privacy-attentive wallet, scoring a 50 out of 100.\n\nThe company got high marks for having a variety of smartcard-based hardware wallets, including Ledger Nano. The USB stick wallet stores user\'s private keys and when inserted into a computer and validated with a PIN allows users to send and receive to multiple accounts.\n\nLedger\'s Chrome extension also outperformed its competitors due to an interface that moves users away from reusing addresses and allows for management of multiple accounts within a single wallet.\n\nThe extension was deducted points, though, for its lack of advanced privacy features including mixing.\n\nBreadWallet and Airbitz came in second and third, respectively.\n\nBreadWallet received high marks for its use of simplified payment verification (SPV), an option the OBPP lauded for eliminating potential data leaks when transmitting information between other wallet providers and mobile clients.\n\nLikewise, Airbitz was given praise as being one of the first wallets to provide HD architecture. Further, its transaction broadcasting is done through one or more Obelisk servers offering more privacy than the single server models most other wallets use, the report said.\n\nImprovements needed\n\nDarkwallet, which tied for first place last year, was ranked fourth this year with the same 45 out of 100 score. According to the OBPP, the wallet\'s offering remains strong, but it cautioned that there has been a lack of development on the release since February 2015.\n\nDarkwallet tied with Armory last year, but Armory’s ranking dropped to 13th this year with a score of 38 out of 100, a move that coincides with rumors about uncertainty regarding that project’s future.\n\nVenture-backed Coinbase, again, ranked last in the survey this year. OBPP explained that the company\'s custodianship of customer funds and stringent identification process were two reasons for the low score.\n\nAs a regulated entity, Coinbase must comply with know-your-customer (KYC) rules, although OBPP said the company could discourage bitcoin address reuse to enhance privacy without violating those guidelines.\n\nCoinbase recently published a Medium post explaining that it sees itself as more of a retail exchange than a wallet provider.\n\nStar ranking image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

if that doesn’t ring alarm bells you probably deserve at this point to lose your money to them.\n\nMMM MLM & Affiliate programs\n\nMMM Global/China isn’t simply just your based level Ponzi scheme, at least in its current incarnation, in that it offers both an affiliate scheme and multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme on top of the base offering.\n\nAn affiliate scheme is one where you obtain a “referral” bonus (usually a percentage or set amount) for doing certain things, and is a completely legitimate way to make money, at least when it’s not referring people to something that is illegal to begin with, and was popularized online by Amazon.com, Inc.\n\nWith MMM, those who sign up are able to obtain affiliate payments for referrals or for posting positive testimonials online, with users receiving 10 percent from what the company refers to as “all donations of the participants you invited.”\n\nA multi-level marketing scheme is a system where a sales force is given a commission not only for sales they generate directly, but a cut of the salespeople they have recruited make as well; while an MLM in and of itself is not illegal (Amway is the most famous MLM of them all) many MLM’s end up being illegal as they rely more on the revenues passed along via the “downline” (the path from original recruiter down multiple levels as people they have signed up sign up others, and so forth, often as far as 10 levels deep) than they do the original product they were allegedly trying to sell.\n\n\n\nThe MMM MLM involves power users becoming managers who create their own multi-level multi-level structure that offer tiered bonuses from all contributions of the members of their structures, which in this case is their downline.\n\nIs MMM Global/China legal?\n\nMMM claims among other things that it’s not a high-yield investment program (HYIP), and that it is legal, because it is a mutual benefit fund that sees people “help each other for free, and absolutely consciously … transfer money directly to each other, from one bank account to another, without any conditions, guarantees and promises.”\n\nThis is complete and utter rubbish.\n\nUltimately the test of any of these sorts of things is whether the company involved is actually offering a product, or simply relying on payments from new investors to fund the returns of existing investors, and that’s exactly what MMM Global does.\n\nA Ponzi scheme is most definitely illegal in all Western jurisdictions, and in countries like China is classified as an unlicensed investment organization, which also makes it illegal.\n\nIf I invest in MMM, will I get into trouble?\n\nThe obvious answer is not to invest in a scam like MMM Global to begin with, but lets just say you do, or already have.\n\nThere’s no clear answer here as it depends on the country you live in; ultimately authorities are primarily going to be interested in those running the scheme versus those sucked into it as investors (potentially victims).\n\nHowever, there is usually a distinct line between those who join, and those who actively recruit.\n\nIf you are recruiting people to MMM Global/China or any of its similar country based variants, you are promoting an illegal activity and you may well be liable to prosecution.\n\nA not to dissimilar Bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme ran through Hong Kong and Taiwan last year and in both countries those promoting it, that is not the founders but those who signed up then tried to sign up others, were arrested over their involvement.\n\nThere would be no difference in mainland China, or indeed any western country, should you be involved at this level.\n\nI’ve invested in MMM but can’t get my money out, what do I do?\n\nIf you’ve already invested not knowing what you were getting yourself into, the bad news is that it’s highly unlikely you’ll ever get your money back.\n\nHowever that doesn’t mean that you can’t do anything.\n\nReport the scam to local authorities, that may mean local or State police, or even Federal Organizations ranging from the FBI, through to securities bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the U.S., and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) in Australia.\n\nYou may have lost your money by investing in MMM Global, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help stop others getting caught up in the scam and assist in putting the people running it behind bars, where they deserve to belong.\n\nphoto credit: via photopin (license)', 'ADVERTISEMENTS\n\nShare with:\n\nLed by a duo of Blockchain experts, the open source dapp & custom blockchain platform Lisk will allow developers and programmers worldwide to build, publish, distribute and monetize their decentralized applications with ease.

But those plans face the same security challenges as any connected project, and the Austin-based data-security startup Factom is proposing a unique solution: using the digital currency network Bitcoin to reliably date-stamp and authenticate records.\n\nFactom has recently inked two development deals that will help it secure data for cities. One, announced last week, will see Factom working with the Chinese notarization service Ancun Zhengxin to build a data verification back end for companies. The second deal is with technology consultancy iSoftStone, which will work with Factom to directly apply Bitcoin-based data security to smart cities, also starting in China.\n\nAccording to the company, the need for its solution is particularly high there.\n\n“The thing to understand about China,” says Paul Snow, Factom’s chief architect, “is they have larger data integrity and trust issues than we have.” He points to the risk that contractors required to meet closely tracked goals could fake data in their reports to cities, a digital version of the kind of corruption that has led to a wave of infrastructure failures across China.\n\n“You don’t want to admit that traffic is slower than it’s supposed to be,” Stone says.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has been hailed primarily as the first reliable digital currency, it is at heart a uniquely secure database, with a subtle combination of cryptography and social engineering that makes the core network essentially unhackable.\n\nThe Bitcoin network, known as a blockchain, organizes thousands of independent computers that each host copies of a regularly updated transaction ledger. Those “miners” constantly check their copy of the ledger against others, ensuring that no single compromised ledger can impact the overall network.\n\nThe idea of using that scheme for digital records has been growing, and blockchain technology caught fire among banks in 2015 (even as the Bitcoin currency itself had a rough year). There’s also promise that the blockchain could finally provide truly secure and interoperable digital record-keeping for doctors.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin, watch:\n\nBut even within this growing sphere, Factom is somewhat unusual in relying on Bitcoin itself. Though Bitcoin has by far the most highly tested blockchain, many blockchain-based projects, such as the banking network Ripple, have chosen to build separate networks. That’s because Bitcoin has serious limits on both data storage and transaction volume–a particular problem for cities looking to verify a huge stream of data.\n\n“These cities, they’re talking about a hundred million transactions a year,” says Snow. “(That’s) way more space than Bitcoin has.”\n\nThose same data limits are behind internal strife that has roiled Bitcoin in recent months. But Snow and Factom have engineered a workaround by linking their own network to Bitcoin through small encrypted data packets that act something like digital anchors to keep records trustworthy.\n\nSnow emphasizes that Factom won’t add strain to Bitcoin, no matter how much data is processed, because full records and any accounting processes are kept “off-chain.” According to Tiana Laurence, Factom’s chief marketing officer, this system also helps users avoid regulatory entanglement with Bitcoin, whose legal status is still murky in many countries.\n\nSnow says that iSoftStone and Factom are still in the early stages of their collaboration, but he sees huge potential for his company to grow with the emerging universe of Internet connected devices.\n\n“There is no limit to the amount of data Bitcoin can secure.”', 'The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nFor investment banks, blockchain technology looks as much foe as friend. The use of multi-computer databases like that used by the cryptocurrency Bitcoin could cut costs, by automating labour-intensive tasks and stripping out other capital market intermediaries. But it may also eat into revenue.\n\nAt its essence, a blockchain is an immutable record of exchanges of data, money, goods or services that sits on a network of computers. This shared ledger is stored simultaneously on the computers involved, which must first validate and then agree to any changes. This makes fraud acutely hard to perpetrate without majority control of the network. And data security and privacy are enhanced through the use of two types of cryptographic keys: a public one that can be accessed by the computers identifying the transactions, and private ones that belong solely to the buyers and sellers involved.\n\nCapital markets banks see this as a big opportunity. In theory, blockchains could do away with much of the business performed by fee-charging third-party overseers like clearers and custodian banks. The former vouch for counterparties’ credit positions, while the latter transfer cash from one account to another.\n\nWith investment bank-run blockchains, these credit-checking, margin-call and settlement processes could conceivably happen automatically as part of the transaction itself. Instead of needing intermediaries to give it their blessing, the computers at the participating broker-dealers would be the sole signatories required. The main function of custody banks BNY Mellon and State Street would thus become redundant. Private sector clearing houses like LCH.Clearnet, CME Clearing Europe and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation could also conceivably lose business, though they might still be needed to sanction complex derivatives or multi-asset class transactions.\n\nBanks could benefit in other ways too. There would be less need for the thousands of middle and back-office staff that the typical broker-dealer employs. Deutsche Bank as of December employed as many as two-thirds of its 28,280 investment bank staff in such roles.\n\nAll of that implies big cost savings. Separate studies by consultancy Accenture and Spain’s Santander each reckon blockchain technology could save $20 billion in annual costs, although the management consultancy sees that total as applying for the whole securities industry and the Spanish lender views it as applying to just banks. Accenture also says that those cost savings could be as much as a fifth of banks’ IT expenses.\n\nEven so, the potential savings may not be all that material. Investment banks typically spend about a third of their total cost base on IT, including technologists’ salaries. That means blockchain-related savings could have pushed up the industry’s 2015 return on equity, excluding exceptionals, to 10.4 percent, according to Breakingviews’ calculations based on Coalition data. A handy bump, but only just above a cost of equity most analysts put at about 10 percent.\n\nBut with actual industry return on equity just 6.7 percent last year, according to Coalition, it is little wonder that bank bosses are suddenly interested. As many as 42 financial institutions have signed up to bank-funded blockchain development consortium R3. And hopes for blockchain fixes have helped former JPMorgan commodities head Blythe Masters raise $60 million for her Digital Asset Holdings startup.\n\nYet there’s also danger, however small, that other market participants could develop blockchain technology to the detriment of banks. Nasdaq Linq has already offered non-public equity securities on a controlled blockchain, while an Overstock bond has traded on the bitcoin blockchain. The likes of UBS and JPMorgan are rare examples of investment banks that have also managed to develop basic applications.\n\nMore generally, the more that is automated, the less investment banks will have to do. True, big money spinners like the buying and selling of highly structured derivatives may always need human brainpower, while mergers and acquisitions advisory is unquestionably a people business. But there’s no reason why much of the heavy lifting of secondary trading or even equity and bond issuance couldn’t be done largely on automated, blockchain-enabled platforms. Banks may be able to develop some of these trading systems themselves, while buying others. But they could struggle to charge as much for their use.\n\nIt’s hard to quantify how much the twin threats of lower fees and shrinking business could hurt banks. But imagine 10 percent of annual industry revenue vanishes. Even allowing for the potential savings, returns would barely improve from underlying 2015 levels, according to Breakingviews calculations.\n\nBankers disinclined to panic have some crumbs of comfort. There are several difficulties with getting blockchain adoption over the line. Propellerheads are yet to design blockchains that would resolve complicated ownership structures or even allow settlement in more than one currency, as TABB Group notes. Cross-jurisdictional claims also present a formidable legal obstacle. And the cost savings envisaged so far may be on the low side.\n\nStill, the technology seems at least as much as a threat as a benefit for investment banking. If the banks weren’t so desperate to bump up their returns, they might be keener to block blockchain’s advance – rather than help hook it up.', 'Image: Flickr/jazbeck\n\nOn Monday, bitcoin users were up in arms about their transactions taking a long time to be processed by the network, potentially foreshadowing dark, deeply annoying times for the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the past, network slowdowns were the work of hackers or other malicious actors. But this time, the reason for the frustration appears to be much more unsettling and banal. In the absence of any obvious spam transactions or attackers claiming responsibility, some users complained that the bitcoin network is slowing down simply because people are using it the way it\'s meant to be used.\n\n""I think the point is that this is not an attack,"" one Reddit user wrote in reply to a poster asking if a ""stress test,"" another term for a spam attack on the bitcoin network, was behind the slowdown. ""This is now normal.""\n\nTransactions are completed once they\'ve been verified by other users and uploaded to the central ledger, or blockchain. This happens in batches of transactions, called blocks. The current bitcoin protocol says blocks must be smaller than 1 megabyte, a hard-coded restriction that was recently the topic of heated debate in the bitcoin community. The plodding pace of transactions appears to be due to blocks reaching their upper size limit of 1 megabyte with more frequency, and unconfirmed transactions clogging up the ""memory pool,"" a distributed database that lives on every computer running bitcoin software.\n\nBitcoin blocks are fuller than ever. https://t.co/nEraQqztZT pic.twitter.com/ai53l7dmtr\n\n— Antoine Le Calvez (@khannib) February 27, 2016\n\nWhile the actual disruption was likely minimal—some users on Reddit reported waiting more than one hour for their transactions to be confirmed (the normal wait is 10 minutes)—the slowdown may indicate that some developers\' worst fears were coming true about the virtual currency\'s usability. If you\'re trying to buy a coffee with bitcoin, after all, you can\'t very well stand around for an hour in the shop.\n\nIn 2015, prominent bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen proposed increasing the block size, citing large-scale slowdowns as just one of the risks if the change was not made. This kicked off one of the largest and most divisive debates in bitcoin\'s history, causing Andresen to withdraw his proposal and longtime developer Mike Hearn to brand the cryptocurrency a failure.\n\n""[Slowdowns] will become the \'new normal\' increasingly frequently,"" Andresen wrote me in an email. ""A solution to the block limit problem should have been rolled out to the network last year.""\n\nAt the moment, it seems like an alternate proposal to increase the block size to 2 megabytes may succeed among the bitcoin community. But Andresen\'s original, more radical proposal is dead as bitcoiners continue to quibble over the future of the coin.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.
