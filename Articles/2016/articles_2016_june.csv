06/01/2016,"[""Bitcoin has come to be the known as digital gold – a new age currency whose value cannot be eaten away by the inflationary policies of the government. The two have shown divergent trends in May, with Bitcoin's value skyrocketing and gold declining.\n\nCauses for gold's decline\n\nGold is viewed as a safe haven for investment during periods of turmoil and tends to go up during times of crises. Gold also acts as a hedge against inflation and tends to rise when governments follow expansionary monetary policies.\n\nIncreasing interest rates tend to result in a fall in gold prices, because money flows from the bullion market to the treasuries market, resulting in lower demand for bullion. Gold's price has fallen below $1,200 an ounce, losing more than $100 in a month as the prospects of a US interest rate hike increase.\n\nWayne Gordon, ED at UBS Wealth Management, tells Bloomberg:\n\n“The key risk for me now is not whether they will hike once, but actually whether they will hike twice. As a house, we believe they will hike twice in September and December.”\n\nBitcoin's thrust upwards\n\nUnlike gold, Bitcoin's performance during the last week has been phenomenal. From $450 on 25-May, its price has increased by around 20% to $540 currently. The price increase has been attributed to increasing demand in China.\n\nChina has strict capital controls, which combined with a weakening Yuan, has resulted in people looking for ways to transfer value out of China. Bitcoin has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of this, resulting in its price skyrocketing.\n\nChinese investors have often shifted money between asset classes quickly in search of high returns and Bitcoin seems to be the flavour of the season. The impending block reward halving (in July 2016) which will result in a lower supply of new bitcoins hitting the market has also contributed to the positive sentiment.\n\nDu Jin, Chief Marketing Officer at Huobi, tells The Wall Street Journal that “there’s a lot of hot money in China that has to go somewhere.”\n\nBitcoin – more than digital gold\n\nBitcoin and gold have quite a few attributes in common, the chief being limited supply and being difficult to counterfeit. This is the reason why Bitcoin has been referred to as digital gold.\n\nHowever, unlike gold, bitcoins can be transferred across the world at a negligible cost. Import curbs and check-posts cannot stop the movement of bitcoins across national borders.\n\nThese attributes are the key reasons why Chinese investors have turned to Bitcoin rather than gold at this point in time."", ""The conversation that began with Bitcoin's rise has evolved from digital currency to the effects blockchains will have, and then into the value private blockchains will have within enterprises. We are just beginning to understand the implications of an immutable public register, but if you listen, there are echoes of the last game changing shift.\n\nThe arrival of the web in 1993 changed everything. The web browser was a graphical client in what had been a purely text world, and it swept up, or simple swept away everything that preceded it. Are you old enough to remember the web in 1998, five years after its creation? No Google , no YouTube, no Amazon, and your top Christmas wish might have been a 56k modem, which had just become available.\n\nWe can't predict precisely what comes next, but there are recognizable patterns in play. And Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) are in the air.\n\nBack in 2014, when Bitcoin was five, the split between that specific digital currency and the more general concept of the blockchain began. Now it is understood that digital currencies use blockchains, but blockchains are a product in their own right. The roar of hype around public, permissioned, and private blockchains is almost deafening. Every single company with a blockchain solution that is not using Bitcoin is trying to distance themselves from it.\n\nEarlier this month, I was at the Indus Entrepreneurs Conference, a technology event here in Silicon Valley. I heard someone speaking about blockchain at the KPMG booth. An Indian entrepreneur was discussing how Bitcoin was doomed to fail and that blockchain was the future. I asked him about nearly instantaneous payment settlements. He retorted that he had tried to run a Bitcoin wallet service, but chose to close down the service because they determined that Bitcoin would never be regulated and, as such, was doomed to fail.\n\nThis claim regarding regulation struck me as strange. A few months ago I hopped on a plane for Europe and spent the day with members of the European parliament, helping them draft a recently released resolution on virtual currencies, which would likely help to form European regulation, as part of a Bitcoin Regulation working group. My company, Bitwage, is also active with the Blockchain Alliance, which works directly with regulators and enforcement agencies from the United States and abroad, to help create unity between the bitcoin industry and governments.\n\nThis was not the first time I heard FUD coming from a non-Bitcoin blockchain technology company (see Tim Swanson of R3), but hearing this coming from an unknown blockchain company was quite startling. Or rather an instance of what is happening industry wide.\n\nThere are four main things driving the excitement about blockchains in the enterprise. These are: 1) Proof of Authenticity 2) Data Notarization 3) Data Aggregation and 4) Asset Settlement."", 'It looks like the Bitcoin market value got a sudden shot in the arm as Chinese investments have pushed the price up by almost $100 (see below). During a money laundering court case in Florida, an economics professor argued that bitcoins are “not money” by comparing the cryptocurrency to collectible baseball cards and comic books. In what makes the second largest auction of seized bitcoins, Australian officials will be selling off bitcoins as proceeds to a crime in Sydney to the tune of 24,518 on June 20.\n\nNot quite Bitcoin, but the Ethereum blockchain DAO (or Distributed Autonomous Organization or “The DAO”) has finished its crowdfunding round to become the largest crowdfunded project in history exceeding $167 million USD in funds. The DAO is also an experiment in company-as-code as the entire organization runs using smart contracts and computer code in order to codify its own corporate governance. Read below about the rise of this interesting new class of business, the way it works and the current fears critics have about the future of the project.\n\nThis past week Bitcoin market prices got interesting: the market value jumped almost $100 over the three-day weekend. BTC market value currently holds an average price of $536.50 USD (according to BitcoinAverage.com) compared to the $451 reported in last week’s Bitcoin Weekly. The market rise began just after May 25, 2016 and found its peak around May 30 around $550, with a trough and then an uptick.\n\nSpeculation contends that Chinese markets are behind this sudden rise in Bitcoin market value with investors coming back to the market once again.\n\nAll this and more in this Bitcoin Weekly.\n\nWall Street Journal reports Chinese influence on Bitcoin market leading to 20 percent rise\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin market value has seen an almost 30 percent boost and the Wall Street Journal is reporting (warning: paywall site) that the reason may be increased trading and investment from China.\n\nThe WSJ reports that two well known Chinese exchanges, Huobi and OKCoin, collectively represent 92 percent of global trading in bitcoin across the time of the price increase.\n\nOther factors may be involved in this value increase as the block reward for Bitcoin miners will be halved soon. In approximately five weeks, the reward for miners “discovering” a new block will reduce from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. As the total number of bitcoins available to be mined is predetermined, this event happens periodically until the reward will reduce to zero.\n\nAs this event will change the total number of bitcoins flowing in, and also affect the profitability of mining, it may certainly have a market effect.\n\nFor more information on “The Halvening,” Joseph Young at Bitcoin Magazine does an excellent job at describing the protocol phenomena and its potential effects.\n\nBitcoin described as “not money” in Florida money laundering case by economics professor\n\nThe debate over if bitcoins should be considered money or not money has constantly caught the attention of the Bitcoin community. The nature of bitcoins as a medium of exchange and store of value (properties of money) speak to the core of its use as a currency; but this also leads to questions as to how its trade will be regulated by governments.\n\nDuring a recent money laundering case in Florida, the defense for Michell Espinoza, accused of selling laundered $1,500 worth of bitcoins to federal agents, called upon Barry University associate economics professor Charles Evans who claimed that bitcoins are not technically money under local law.\n\n“Basically, it’s poker chips that people are willing to buy from you,” Evans testified.\n\nThe irony of this statement is reflected in the fact that Evans received $3,000 in bitcoins as his fee as defense witness.\n\nIn addition, Evans argued that no central bank or authority backs Bitcoin within the United States and that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers Bitcoin trading bartering in a commodity. He then went on to compare assigning worth to bitcoins as similar to how collectors determine the value of baseball cards or comic books for purposes of trade.\n\nAccording to the argument, if bitcoins are not legally money therefore trading in them cannot be money laundering and the defense wants the charges thus dismissed.\n\nA ruling is expected on the defense motion to dismiss in approximately two weeks.\n\nAustralia to auction off $11.5M in confiscated bitcoins\n\nApproximately $11.5M in confiscated bitcoins will be auctioned off in Sydney, Australia later this month in the first such auction outside of the United States and the second largest ever. The first largest auction of confiscated bitcoins happened in 2014 when the U.S. Marshals auctioned off over 144,000 bitcoins seized the Silk Road dark web marketplace across a series of auctions.\n\nAccording to CNBC, the sale will take place June 20-21 and involve 24,518 bitcoins. The bitcoins are the proceeds of a crime committed by an unidentified Australian man convicted of commercial drug trafficking in 2014. Australian department of justice officials declined to comment on the case except to confirm the seizure of coins in 2013.\n\nAccording to Phys.org, officials said registered bidders will be told the name of the person from whom the bitcoins were confiscated.\n\nBidders may register with Ernst & Young, the financial firm running the auction, until June 7 for the 48-hour sealed auction on June 20.\n\nThe lateness of this auction from the apparent confiscation is interesting, but not unknown in criminal trials.\n\nThe Ethereum DAO crowdfunding has ended and it is now up and running\n\nThe first Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO), a fully self-operating and self-governed organization that runs entirely on code and not the governance of people, is now running on the Ethereum blockchain after its initial crowdfunding round.\n\nThe crowdfunding round, which ran from late April to May 28, raised more than $167.93 million USD in funds by selling 1172.78 million DAO tokens (a cryptocurrency necessary for participating in the DAO itself) for Ether (ETH), the Ethereum blockchain cryptocurrency. This event makes the DAO crowdfound the largest cryptocurrency crowdfunding experiment ever. It even exceeds the current crowdfund investment in Star Citizen, which is one of the biggest crowdfunded video games in existence at $114.7 million and counting.\n\nThe Ethereum DAO is experimental and will be one of the first test cases in what it means to have a fully decentralized autonomous organization that can operate based on its own code, which generates the rules for interaction and governance via UI, computer protocol, programmable API and smart contracts.\n\nThe functionality of the DAO itself is quite complex and requires a bit of research to understand read this DAO 101 for details.\n\n“DAOs hold potential to create a new asset class in a new asset class,” said Charles Hayter, CEO of CryptoCompare (Crypto Coin Comparison LTD), “but it’s early days so caution on known unknowns and unknown unknowns has to be advised. Attack vectors to the code, or idealistic rather than practical tools for governance in its coded ‘Articles of Association’ and ‘Shareholders Agreements’ are not tried and tested.”\n\nDuring the DAO token sales, which were exchanged for ETH, the exchange rates for ETH saw a notable increase in both value and volume. Compared to the large crowdfunding for the DAO, this represents an increased interest in ETH during that period.\n\nHayter’s concerns about the unknown qualities of the DAO’s own coded governance nature have also been spreading through the media during the past week. Mere days after the initial launch of the DAO platform critics began to voice apprehensions.\n\nIn fact, May 30 articles appeared on Inverse, Quartz and CryptoCoinsNews voicing those concerns. The biggest on the block, research from cryptocurrency entrepreneur Dino Mark, Ethereum researcher Vlad Zamfir and Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer published on May 27, called for an immediate moratorium on the experiment.\n\n“In this paper, we analyze the rules of The DAO and identify problems with its mechanism design that incentivize investors to behave strategically;” the researchers wrote, “that is, at odds with truthfully voting to reveal their preferences. We then outline potential attacks against The DAO made possible by these behaviors.”\n\nThe paper then goes on to list nine causes that they expect would lead participants in the DAO to collude and commit to “strategic rather than honest behaviors.” This, the researchers fear, could lead to casual participants in the DAO, who do not vote but instead just want to invest and come along for the ride, to get colloquially taken for that ride.\n\nThe DAO is only days old and the functions that it can support and what it will do are still being formulated.\n\nPeople interested in becoming involved in the DAO now that the initial funding round is complete can still participate. People interested in having the DAO do something (i.e. produce a product, a service, whatever) can submit proposals and have their ideas evaluated for inclusion. Simon Dingle, a fintech podcaster, wrote a very good article on Medium describing this process and the DAO for beginners.\n\nCritics and investors still need to duke it out and the DAO has not yet evaluated or launched any projects using its proposal system. It will depend on the holders of the DAO tokens whether this experiment rises to expectations or smashes on the rocks.\n\nEither will progress expectations for future experiments and push the horizon for using blockchains and smart contracts for future autonomous organizations.\n\nFeatured image credit: Bitcoin Logo, https://www.flickr.com/photos/thelastminute/12350379324.', 'A member of the Barclays blockchain team has revealed to Business Insider he will be departing the UK banking giant to join a FinTech consultancy called 11:FS.\n\nSimon Taylor, formerly VP of entrepreneurial partnerships at Barclays, will depart the bank on 24th June. Taylor has long been one of the bank’s more outspoken members on matters relating to distributed ledgers and blockchain, frequently opined on the subject on social media and in published posts.\n\nTaylor told CoinDesk his role will be to consult and educate banks on blockchain tech and advising the company\'s planned investment fund.\n\nAt the firm, Taylor joins Financial Services Club (FSC) chair Chris Skinner; former head of digital banking at Gartner David Brear; and Mondo banking app co-founder Jason Bates.\n\nTogether, the team is seeking to raise $100m in part to build a portfolio of blockchain investments, as well as to provide consultancy and research services.\n\nThe fund has raised $5m as of April, and is hoping to raise additional capital from mid-sized banks. Skinner told CoinDesk Thomas Labenbacher, a veteran of Fidor Bank and Western Union will serve as managing director of the fund, while Brear will be its lead partner.\n\nIn statements, Barclays confirmed the departure, stating that ""no direct replacement"" had yet been named for Taylor.\n\nBarclays image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Santander U.K. has announced its introduction of blockchain technology for international payments through a new app that is currently being rolled out as a staff pilot. The bank plans to make the application, which is only available on Apple’s iOS, available to consumers after it completes the pilot program. The announcement makes Santander the first bank in the U.K. to use blockchain for international payments.\n\nThe new Santander app connects to Apple Pay, where users can confirm payments securely using Touch ID. It lets users transfer between £10 and £10,000, and payments can be made from British pounds to euros and U.S. dollars. Currently, payments made in euros can be sent to 21 countries and U.S. dollar payments to the United States only.\n\n“The need for finance has evolved from providing a physical pound in your pocket or card in your purse, where you pay at a till, to being seamlessly integrated into a new, always on, connected lifestyle,” said Sigga Sigurdardottir, head of customer and innovation at Santander. ""At Santander we work hard to ensure our banking is simple, personal and fair and believe new blockchain technology will play a transformational role in the way we achieve our goals and better serve our customers, adding value by creating more choice and convenience.""\n\nThe Santander app is powered by the blockchain technology implementation developed by Ripple, a company in which Santander Innoventures, the $100 million fintech venture capital fund of Santander Group, has invested. Working with Ripple builds on Santander’s philosophy of collaborating with the most innovative companies to consistently provide better services to customers. In June 2015, Bitcoin Magazine reported that, in a paper titled “The Fintech 2.0 Paper: Rebooting financial services,” Santander Innoventures issued “a call to action to banks, financial institutions and financial technology (fintech) businesses to work together to undertake a fundamental ‘reboot’ of the core processes, systems and infrastructure of the banking industry.”\n\nAccording to Ripple, its technology offers a real-time cross-currency settlement solution that is flexible enough to comply with the risk policy, privacy and compliance needs of banks. “It is architected to fit within your bank’s existing infrastructure, resulting in minimal integration overhead and business disruption,” notes the Ripple website.\n\n“Ripple is redefining the way that value moves around the world, and today we’re already enabling real-time, affordable international settlement between banks who have adopted our solutions,” said Ripple cofounder and CEO Chris Larsen. “As an early adopter and pioneer in the banking industry, Santander is the first bank in the world to transfer real funds externally. In doing so, they are creating a new, exemplary standard of service.” The Ripple announcement notes that security and regulatory compliance is central to all activity undertaken at Santander and their Ripple-powered app has already undergone the same rigorous testing all new technology goes through ahead of roll out.\n\nThe move is a much-needed response to the upcoming wave of digital payment providers that threatens to lure customers away from the banks.\n\n“Clearly, it’s an area where, as an industry, we don’t have as good a customer experience as we could do . . . there are a lot of pain points,” said Ed Metzger, head of innovation, technology and operations at Santander U.K., as reported by The Financial Times. “There’s lots of activity in international payments.” Metzger added that the reason why new digital players have been able to make progress is because “customer experiences through normal channels aren’t great.”\n\n“It’s the first time a U.K. bank has sent payments of this type via Ripple and launched it as a commercial service,” Metzger told Bloomberg News. “Many people are doing lab style experiments, the key difference here is about getting real people to send real money for real purposes. I just paid my wife, who is Spanish, some money to a Spanish bank account this morning.”\n\nBloomberg News notes that Santander is one of several major banks, including Citigroup, UBS and Barclays, striving to find ways to exploit the distributed ledger technology behind Bitcoin to cut costs and stay at the leading edge of modern fintech.\n\nIn April, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Barclays formed a partnership with “Bitcoin bank” Circle in a move that received welcoming support from U.K. authorities. Barclays Corporate Banking is providing the account that Circle needs to store sterling for consumers and the infrastructure to allow transfers from any U.K. bank account in and out of Circle. An interesting feature of the Barclays/Circle initiative is that it uses the standard, public Bitcoin blockchain, instead of an alternative implementation.', 'PayPal has filed a US patent application for a modular payment module that accepts Bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nThe application names Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin; and sets out the physical characteristics of the module.\n\nIt says: “The module includes a chassis which has a modular device connector. A payment database in the chassis stores funding source information and security information.”\n\nThe patent application also describes a “virtual currency wallet system”. This entails a card that includes a virtual currency wallet; a non-transitory memory including instructions to provide a virtual machine that is configured to provide access to the virtual currency wallet; and one or more hardware processors that are coupled to the card and the non-transitory memory.\n\nWhile nothing has happened yet, the interest in Bitcoin by a large company such as PayPal could be significant.\n\nMainstream moments?\n\nBitcoin has become a common sight under the spotlight.\n\nRecently, the world enjoyed (or suffered) some mystery and revelation when Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright claimed to be Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe European Commission (EC) wants to update the fourth Anti-Money Laundering directive so it also covers virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin. In the UK, the Treasury has followed suit by announcing plans to subject virtual currency exchanges to the same regulations as banks.\n\nAn opinion piece “Will regulation be a blessing or a blow for Bitcoin?” explored the implications of this directive.', 'In an announcement yesterday, Bitstamp has announced that clients can now trade Euros for Dollars, marking the bitcoin exchange’s entry into the biggest traditional currency trading pair in the foreign exchange market.\n\nBitcoin exchange Bitstamp has entered the largest and the most liquid trading market in the world, Forex, by enabling EUR/USD trading for its clients.\n\nThe foreign exchange market sees over $5 trillion in trading every day, easily dwarfing the likes of the Futures and the Equities market. That’s an average of over $200 billion, every hour.\n\nWhile the forex encompasses all world currencies, a few major currencies stand out as the most traded pairs. The US dollar makes up the majority of Forex transactions and the EUR/USD pair is unsurprisingly the most traded pair, due to the USD itself and the Euro, a currency backed by multiple member countries on a platform of easy trade.\n\nThe average daily trading in the EUR/USD stood at $241 billion, nearly double that of the next closest trading pair in USD/JPY. Amid market turmoil last year, the EUR/USD pair saw its heaviest volume since 2010, underlining the relevance of the two biggest currencies.\n\nBitstamp’s endeavor into the forex market to enable EUR/USD trading could prove to be substantial for cryptocurrencies. Traders and companies that routinely hold and transact with USD and the Euro now have an additional platform wherein they gain access to digital currencies.\n\nWith its announcement yesterday, Bitstamp stated:\n\nWe are excited to announce that our clients can now use our new EUR/USD trading pair. The new trading pair allows for better mobility of funds and new arbitrage opportunities.\n\nHeadquartered in Luxembourg after acquiring its license, Bitstamp had previously enabled bitcoin purchasing via credit and debit cards for users in Germany and Italy earlier this year.\n\nThe European exchange, which will soon become the first fully licensed bitcoin exchange in Europe – following a license granted by EU member Luxembourg – joins fellow European digital currency exchange BTC-e in offering EUR/USD trading.\n\nWhile it isn’t the first bitcoin exchange to introduce the all-fiat trading pair, Bitstamp’s license to operate as a payment institution across all 28 countries of the European Union will serve a far wider audience.\n\nBItstamp will charge a flat fee of 0.20% for EUR/USD trading. In comparison, BTC/USD and BTC/EUR trading sees fees between 0.10% to 0.25%, depending on the volume of currency traded.\n\nThe minimum allowable trade for any currency in the platform is $5.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'For some market observers, the embrace of Ethereum by exchange and wallet startup Coinbase was a long time coming.\n\nLast month, the co-founder of one of the most heavily funded bitcoin startups, Coinbase, announced that its digital currency exchange would start trading ethers, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. The move came after the startup hosted creator Vitalik Buterin at its headquarters for a presentation on Ethereum this March.\n\nYet, it was the way co-founder Fred Ehrsam released the news – with a complete rebrand to one of the company’s core products accompanied by a strongly worded blog post that warned of bitcoin’s susceptibility to Ethereum, that triggered a strong response throughout the digital currency community.\n\nCoinbase later said it accepted more than 2 million ethers in new deposits on its first day of accepting the digital currency. At the same time, critics of the move took to social media to voice frustration over what some perceived to be a betrayal of the company\'s initial user base.\n\nBut according to some industry observers, the decision was ultimately a practical one, following other startups in the bitcoin space that have begun developing products around Ethereum.\n\nA logical step\n\nGil Luria, head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, believes that Coinbase’s decision to enable Ethereum trades on its GDAX platform is in alignment with the company’s commitment to provide access to ""whatever cryptocurrency made the most sense for its users"".\n\nBut it is Ethereum’s potential use for managing smart contracts, prediction markets and decentralized organizations that Luria thinks most distinguished it for Coinbase.\n\nLuria told CoinDesk:\n\n""[Coinbase] avoided me-too altcoins such as Litecoin, but [it] looks like they believe Ethereum is different. Since Ethereum has the potential to add significant functionality that may not be available on the bitcoin network, and since there is clearly robust demand for ethers, it makes sense for Coinbase to expand into ethers.""\n\nAuthor Alex Tapscott argued that the reason Coinbase pursued an integration with Ethereum was because doing so offered both long- and short-term benefits.\n\n""Volumes are skyrocketing and so too will their fees, but more importantly putting a stake in the ground here is critical as I expect Coinbase will want to participate in the [decentralized applications] that get built on top of this new blockchain,"" he said.\n\nA chink in the armor\n\nAs can be expected, prominent supporters and participants in the Ethereum project were more bullish on the move.\n\nSpeaking with CoinDesk, Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio described Coinbase’s entry into the Ethereum marketplace as a ""no-brainer"" based on the number and range of third-party projects being built on the platform.\n\nDi Iorio, CEO of wallet software developer KryptoKit, said Coinbase\'s acceptance of another digital currency is the latest step in what he sees as an ongoing trend.\n\nDi Iorio said:\n\n""The more blockchains the better, the more competition the better. I think you’re going to start seeing every company turning into a multi-currency, multi-token system.""\n\nMeanwhile, Peter Luce, principal at blockchain consulting firm Ouroboros LLP, partially credited another Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for being ""somewhat of a benevolent dictator"", and driving the network\'s success in closing the gap with bitcoin.\n\nBut Luce also blamed a lack of direction in the bitcoin community that led to opportunities not only for Ethereum but Ripple, R3CEV, Hyperledger and others.\n\n""Bitcoin has failed to emerge as a fiat currency killer not because governments have succeeded at suppressing it,"" said Luce. ""But because its benefits for the average citizen are, today, not nearly compelling enough to lead to mass adoption.""\n\nDeveloper mindshare\n\nBut, not every market observer sees Ethereum beating out bitcoin\'s first-mover advantage.\n\nResearcher Spencer Bogart of investment bank Needham & Company called Coinbase’s decision to embrace Ethereum a smart way to diversify the company’s product offering, while still leveraging its existing digital currency exchange infrastructure.\n\nBogart, however, downplayed Ehrsam’s warning that Ethereum’s functionality, including a scripting language that makes it easier to build applications, was a possible threat to bitcoin’s first-mover advantage.\n\n""It doesn’t mean Ethereum will overcome Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage and succeed in attracting a critical mass of developer mindshare,"" Bogart said, adding:\n\n""In fact, everything I’m seeing shows that bitcoin still has significantly greater developer mind-share than Ethereum.""\n\nBy the numbers\n\nOpinions aside, markets for both digital currencies continue to attract attention.\n\nThe move by Coinbase to accept Ethereum came amid a period of heightened trade volume in both ether and bitcoins markets, the latter of which has seen accelerated price gains in recent days.\n\nWhile bitcoin enjoyed a relatively strong week last week – appreciating by about 4% prior to this weekend\'s price jump – the price of ether fell, tumbling roughly 14% in the seven days leading up to 27th May.\n\nAt press time, ether is trading at a price of roughly $14 on data from US-based exchange Poloniex, while the price of bitcoin is approximately $536, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin USD Price Index.\n\nLong-term market capitalizations highlight the trajectory of growth as well. At the time of the Ethereum crowdsale, which ended in August 2014, bitcoin\'s market cap was approximately $7.6bn, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.\n\nWhile bitcoin\'s market cap has largely remained the same, reaching more than $8bn today, Ethereum\'s market cap has climbed to over $1bn since inception.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In Dubai, for example, more than 30 regional startups, government agencies and regional enterprise businesses have come together so far this year to begin working on proofs-of-concept with the technology.\n\nRaza Rizvi, a UAE-based commercial IP lawyer with Simmons & Simmons, sees the development as perhaps more indicative of Abu Dhabi’s wider push to attract enterprise financial institutions, though he said the initiatives could prove synergistic.\n\n""No doubt the two independent initiatives will bring out the best in each other and enable the UAE as a whole to lead the way in the FinTech sector and usage of blockchain technology in the Middle East,"" he said.\n\nLaunched in late 2015, ADGM has been increasingly active in recent months, appointing a regulatory committee in January and signing an agreement with FinTech accelerator Flat6Labs earlier this week that will find the startup incubator working with the regulator on fostering innovation.\n\nThe efforts are seen as part of a long-term strategy to attract the financial services industry to the UAE capital with incentives including full foreign ownership and tax exemptions.\n\nImage credit: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""The Lightning Network is probably the most highly anticipated technological innovation to be deployed on top of Bitcoin. The payment layer, first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja about a year ago, promises to support a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions among users, at nearly no cost – while leveraging the security offered by Bitcoin.\n\nAt least three companies – Poon and Dryja's Lightning, Blockstream and Blockchain – are currently working on implementations of the technology. But few outside this small technological frontline fully grasp how the “future of micropayments” is set to boost Bitcoin’s capabilities.\n\nIn this three-part series, Bitcoin Magazine lays out the basic building blocks of the Lightning Network, and shows how they fit together to realize this upcoming protocol layer.\n\nThis first part of the series establishes the necessary building blocks, and shows how these can be combined to create “smart contracts,” which can be applied to realize the first requirement of the Lightning Network: a bidirectional payment channel.\n\n(Note: Anyone with a solid understanding of Bitcoin can skip the building blocks.)\n\nBuilding Block #1: Unconfirmed Transactions\n\nAt its heart, the Bitcoin protocol consists of transactions, that are typically linked to previous transactions, and potentially to future transactions. Each transaction contains inputs, which refer to addresses bitcoins are sent from, and outputs, which refer to addresses bitcoins are sent to. Additionally, inputs must include the requirements to send the bitcoins, like signatures that prove “ownership” of the input-addresses. Outputs, meanwhile, establish the new requirements, that must be included in the input of a subsequent transaction.\n\nAs one of its key features, the Lightning Network is built up from more or less regular Bitcoin transactions. It's just that these transactions are typically not actually broadcast over the Bitcoin network. Instead, they are stored locally, on the nodes of users - but they can be broadcast over the network at any time.\n\nBuilding Block #2: Double-Spend Protection\n\nThe second building block for the Lightning Network probably doesn't require much explaining, as it's arguably the raison d'être for Bitcoin itself: double-spend protection. If two transactions (or: inputs) rely on the same output, only one can confirm.\n\nThe important thing to keep in mind here is that even unconfirmed transactions can be conflicting, meaning only one can ever confirm.\n\nBuilding Block #3: Multisig\n\nThe third building block of the Lightning Network is also a straightforward one: multisignature (multisig) addresses. (Or more generally: P2SH-addresses.)\n\nMultisig addresses are Bitcoin addresses that – as the name suggests - require multiple private keys to “unlock” and spend bitcoins from. Multisig addresses can be set up under all sorts of conditions. For instance to require two out of three possible keys, or fifteen out of fifteen, or just about any other combination.\n\nThe Lightning Network often uses two out of two (2-of-2) multisig set-ups. Unlocking bitcoins from 2-of-2 multisig addresses requires two signatures, from two dedicated keys.\n\nBuilding Block #4: Time-Locks\n\nThe fourth building block is the time-lock. Time-locks can “lock bitcoins up” in an output, to make them spendable (to be included in a subsequent input) only at some point in the future.\n\nThere are two different types of time-locks: the absolute type, called CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV), and the relative type, CheckSequenceVerify (CSV). CLTV locks bitcoins up until a (more or less) concrete time in the future: an actual time and date, or a specific block height. CSV, instead, uses relative time. Once a CVS-output is recorded on the blockchain, it takes a specific amount of blocks from that point on before the bitcoins can be spent again.\n\nBuilding Block #5: Hash Values and Secrets\n\nThe fifth and final building block – cryptography - is the most fundamental building block of Bitcoin itself. But in the Lightning Network, it’s applied in a new way.\n\nIn short, a “value” or “secret” is a long and unique string of numbers that is practically impossible to guess, even for a computer with infinite tries. With a special calculation, this value (or secret) can be “hashed” into a different string of numbers, a “hash.” And here's the trick: anyone who knows the value can easily reproduce the hash. But this doesn't work the other way around; it's a one way street.\n\nThis trick can be utilized in Bitcoin itself, again to “lock bitcoins up.” (In fact, it's really how Bitcoin works.) For example, a hash can be included in an output, and require the subsequent input to include the corresponding value in order to be spendable.\n\nThe First Challenge: Bidirectional Payment Channels\n\nEven before the Lightning Network was presented, the concept of payment channels had been around for some time. Typical payment channels are useful for certain purposes, but also limited: they are one-directional. Alice can pay Bob several off-chain transactions, but Bob cannot pay Alice through the same channel at all.\n\nAs a key feature of the Lightning Network, Poon and Dryja proposed trustless bidirectional payment channels.\n\nOpening the Channel\n\nTo set up a bidirectional payment channel, both parties involved must first agree on an opening transaction. This opening transaction determines how many bitcoins each deposits into the channel.\n\nLet's say Alice wants to send one bitcoin to Bob. Since Alice and Bob expect to transact more frequently, they decide to open up a bidirectional payment channel, and use this to send the bitcoin. (Sending a whole bitcoin is probably a lot for a payment channel, as these might be more useful for micropayments – but it's perfectly possible.)\n\nTo open the channel, Alice and Bob each send five bitcoins to a 2-of-2 multisig address. This is the “opening transaction.” Bitcoins can only be spent from this address if both Alice and Bob sign a subsequent transaction.\n\nAdditionally, Alice and Bob both create a secret (a string of numbers), and exchange the hash.\n\nAlice now immediately creates a subsequent transaction from the opening transaction. This is a “commitment transaction.” With the commitment transaction, Alice sends four bitcoins to herself, and six bitcoins to a second multisig address. This second multisig address is a bit funky. It can be unlocked by Bob on his own, but only after 1000 extra blocks have been mined after it’s included on the blockchain; it includes a CSV-lock. Or, it can be opened by Alice on her own, but only if she also includes the secret for which Bob has just now given her the hash. (Of course, Alice has no idea what this secret is – she only knows hash – so there's no way she can make use of this option right now.)\n\nAlice signs her end of this commitment transaction. But she doesn't broadcast it! Instead, she gives it to Bob.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob does the same, but mirrored. He creates a commitment transaction as well, from which he sends six bitcoins to himself, and four to a funky new multisig-address. Alice can unlock this address if she waits an additional 1000 blocks, or Bob can unlock it with Alice using her secret.\n\nBob signs this half, and gives it to Alice.\n\nAfter all this exchanging of “half-valid” commitment transactions and hashes of secrets, they both sign and broadcast the opening transaction, to make sure it's recorded on the blockchain. The channel is now officially open.\n\nAt this point, both Alice and Bob could sign and broadcast the half-valid commitment transaction they got from the other. If Alice does, Bob gets six bitcoins immediately. If Bob does, Alice gets four bitcoins immediately. But whomever signs and broadcasts the transaction will have to wait 1000 blocks to unlock the subsequent multisig-address, and claim the remaining bitcoins.\n\nHowever, and this is the key trick of a payment channel: neither sign and broadcast their half of the transaction at all.\n\nUpdating the Channel\n\nA little later, Bob wants to send Alice one bitcoin back. They want to update the channel state, to make the balance five-five again. To accomplish this, Alice and Bob do two things.\n\nFirst, both repeat the process as described above (except that the opening transaction is already recorded on the blockchain; that part is skipped). This time, both Alice and Bob attribute themselves five bitcoins, and both attribute five bitcoins to funky multisig-addresses. The conditions for these multisig-addresses are similar, except that they require new secrets: both Alice and Bob provide each other withnew hashes. They both sign their new half valid commitment transaction, and give it to each other.\n\nSecond, Alice and Bob hand each other their first secrets, as used in the first set-up.\n\nAt this point, again, both Alice and Bob could sign and broadcast the new “half valid” commitment transaction they just got. Their counterparty would get five bitcoins immediately, while the broadcaster would have to wait 1000 blocks. As such, the channel is updated.\n\nBut what's stopping Bob from broadcasting the older commitment transaction instead? That commitment transaction led to a path that paid him six bitcoins, instead of five….\n\nWhat’s stopping Bob, of course, is his first secret, which he has now given to Alice.\n\nBob cannot safely sign and broadcast the older commitment transaction any more, because Alice now knows Bob's first secret. If Bob were to sign and broadcast that commitment transaction, he would immediately send four bitcoins to Alice... and he would have to wait 1000 blocks to claim his own six bitcoins. That's a problem, because now that Alice knows his secret, she could use this time to beat Bob to the punch, and claim the other six bitcoins as well!\n\nAnd since Bob has Alice’s secret too, this is just as true for the other way around. If Alice tries to sign and broadcast an old commitment transaction, Bob can steal all the bitcoins in the channel.\n\nThis of course means that both Alice and Bob are strongly incentivized to play fair, and only ever sign and broadcast the most recent state of the channel.\n\nNext, this bidirectional payment channel set-up needs to expand to allow payments over a network. This is covered in the second article of this series.\n\nThanks to Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon for added feedback.""]"
06/02/2016,"['Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex has settled with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) following an investigation into its financed trading activities.\n\nBitfinex settled charges that it offered illegal off-exchange financed retail commodities trading, as well as failed to register as a futures commission merchant. Bitfinex did not admit or deny the CFTC findings, the agency said today.\n\nAccording to an order published today by the CFTC, the issues arose owing to how Bitfinex held functional control over funds tied to leveraged or margin trading on the platform. The CFTC said that because no actual commodities were delivered by Bitfinex to its customers – the private keys tied to the applicable bitcoins remained under the exchange’s control – it was in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act.\n\nBitfinex will pay $75,000 in civil penalties, according to the order, and has moved to change its internal policies and avoid further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.\n\nThe CFTC said a statement:\n\n“The Order finds that from April 2013 to at least February 2016, Bitfinex permitted users to borrow funds from other users on the platform in order to trade bitcoins on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. The Order also finds that Bitfinex did not actually deliver those bitcoins to the traders who purchased them. Instead, Bitfinex held the bitcoins in deposit wallets that it owned and controlled, the Order states.”\n\nA futures commission merchant, according to the National Futures Association, is an entity that is authorized to sell or accept money for these kinds of financial products. According to the CFTC, Bitfinex did not register before offering this type of service.\n\nThe settlement comes months after rumors circulated that the CFTC was investigating Bitfinex.\n\nIn September, an anonymous tipster posted on social media about the then-rumored investigation, sharing a link to an email attributed to CFTC trial attorney Michael Frisch. Frisch’s name appears among the CFTC staffers listed on the agency’s press release regarding the settlement.\n\nIt was around this time that the exchange first contacted the CFTC, according to the order. The agency went on to say that the company was proactive in its cooperation.\n\nBitfinex, which according to data from Bitcoinity is the largest bitcoin exchange by US dollar trade volume, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement posted to its website, the exchange outlined the settlement and said that it had moved to address what the CFTC was investigating.\n\n""In response to these constructive discussions with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, BFXNA has made significant changes to the way in which US customers engage in financed trading on Bitfinex. Bitfinex remains committed to continually improving its customers’ experience while complying with applicable laws and regulatory requirements,"" the company wrote.\n\nIn September, the CFTC moved to assert its jurisdiction over bitcoin and digital currencies, classifying them as commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act.\n\nThe full settlement order can be found below:\n\nBitfinex Order\n\nThis report has been updated.\n\nImages via Shutterstock, CFTC\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Blueshyft\'s technology already allows customers to connect in-store with the bookmaker Ladbrokes, among other services.\n\nAccording to Rupert Hackett, general manager of Bitcoin.com.au, the joint venture should help promote trust in Bitcoin, which doesn\'t exactly have the best reputation as a reliable place to put your money.\n\nBy going in-store, they hope to inspire trust by providing a tangible experience. ""It\'s hard to trust the current Bitcoin exchanges because the process is very vague to the consumer,"" he told Mashable Australia. ""We believe that through this retail partnership, we\'re offering proper branding that will give a lot of trust to the consumer.""\n\nAn iPad in the newsagent will allow punters to make the transaction, and the companies will take a four percent commission on sales.\n\nAs of writing, one Bitcoin was worth A$744.24, which seems like a lot to hand over at your local newsagency. However, Hackett said people would be able to purchase portions of a Bitcoin. To begin with, they\'re aiming for an average transaction of A$150 to A$200.\n\nThe minimum transaction will be $50, but Hackett said they\'d like to drop that further and lower the barrier to entry.

Share it in the comments.', ""PayPal has been forced to cease operations in Turkey. The shutdown will go into effect on June 6. Turkey recently denied PayPal of a new license, which is required to operate within the country. According to TechCrunch, the reason for the denial was that PayPal does not localize all of their IT infrastructure inside of Turkey.\n\nTo get a clearer picture of what’s going on in Turkey, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Emre Kenci, CTO and co-founder of BTCTrader, which owns and operates Turkish Bitcoin exchange BTCTurk.\n\nWill Other Online Payment Providers Leave Turkey?\n\nAccording to Kenci, PayPal’s reasons for leaving Turkey may also apply to other payment providers. Then again, others are able to earn exemptions. “Businesses like Western Union have been exempt from the law,” said Kenci.\n\n“If the business is holding funds on behalf of the consumer, for the purpose of allowing the consumers to transfer money to other consumers or businesses, then the business needs an electronic money license,” explained Kenci. “If the business does not hold any consumer funds but allows businesses to accept payments, then they need a payment processor license. Electronic money license holders are allowed to operate as payment processors. So the latter license is a subset of the former. Each business is evaluated by the regulator on a case-by-case basis.”\n\nKenci also noted the regulation goes far beyond the reported requirement to keep all IT infrastructure within the country’s borders. “Everything from the organization chart to the CV of the CEO, from the paid capital of the business to how funds are held in bank accounts, [and] financial and security audits are within the scope of the regulation. And there are specific rules for each,” he explained.\n\nKenci added that all of these requirements create a barrier to entry for small businesses who wish to experiment with new, innovative ideas.\n\nIn terms of Kenci’s own business, he holds the view that the activities of BTCTurk do not fall within the scope of this law. “The regulation's scope is holding and allowing the transfer of funds in currencies recognized by the central bank of Turkey,” he explained. “The regulator has deemed that bitcoin is out of this scope.”\n\nCan Bitcoin Help for International Transfers?\n\nAlthough there has been a large amount of hype around the use of Bitcoin for international money transfers and remittances, real data on this sort of use case is not yet widely available. According to Kenci, SWIFT is the most popular method of sending money abroad, especially for amounts larger than $1,000.\n\n“The banking infrastructure in Turkey is quite efficient, the digital channels (mobile, web) work well, and the transfer costs are below international rates,” explained Kenci. “Remittance companies, such as Western Union, are also well established and are available as embedded services in almost every bank.”\n\nWhere Can Bitcoin Help?\n\nAccording to Kenci, PayPal was mainly helpful for transfers of small amounts of money and digital payments in Turkey. “We believe that this presents a good opportunity for Bitcoin,” he added.\n\nAlthough Kenci said the recent PayPal news has helped with the PR presence of Bitcoin in Turkey, he also added that the maturity of Bitcoin services in Turkey and the rest of the world are not yet at a level where the technology can fill a void left by PayPal. Having said that, he also noted, “It is certain that the Turkish user base of PayPal will struggle to find a direct replacement.”\n\nIn terms of where Bitcoin is useful in general, Kenci explained, “The interest in Bitcoin, as we saw in Greece via our partner BTCGreece, increases when the existing financial infrastructure does not function, when there are strong capital controls or when people lose trust in national currencies as we currently see in China.”\n\nAccording to Kenci, the financial infrastructure is strong in Turkey, and despite having weakened in the last year and a half, the Turkish lira continues to instill trust in a large part of the population as a store of wealth."", 'Blockchain, the world’s leading provider of Blockchain tools and software, has announced that the first usable implementation of the Lightning network, Thunder, has been released as an alpha.\n\nLightning networks\n\nLightning networks, as explained on the Lightning Network webpage, are dependent upon the underlying technology of the blockchain.\n\nBy using real Bitcoin/Blockchain transactions and using its native smart-contract scripting language, it is possible to create a secure network of participants which are able to transact at high volume and high speed.\n\nEssentially, they are designed to reduce the volume on the Bitcoin blockchain by transferring transactions, and microtransactions in particular to a sidechain that syncs with the main blockchain at regular intervals.\n\nThunder alpha release\n\nIn this alpha release, Blockchain’s implementation of the Lightning network, Thunder has both a node and a wallet present. Blockchain also claims that the network can achieve “better-than-Visa scale (100,000 TPS) with only a few thousand nodes.”\n\nAccording to Blockchain.com, Lightning networks have been purely conceptual until now. With the release of the alpha version of Thunder Network, the company makes it the first usable implementation of the Lightning network for off chain bitcoin payments that settles back to the main Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThus, Thunder has the potential to “facilitate secure, trustless and nearly instant payments, unleash the power of microtransactions, allow the network to handle heavy loads, and increase user privacy.”\n\nBlockchain also says that, due to the free market in an open and permissionless network, fees will be significantly lower than with on-chain payments. In addition, for those interested in security, Blockchain encrypts all communications between nodes and wallets using AES-CTR and only allows them to take place after completing authentication.\n\nThunder is said to relay payments over multiple nodes in the network automatically, using encrypted routing, which basically means that no one knows who made a payment, allowing for more privacy.\n\nMats Jerratsch says about the release:\n\n“Off-chain payment networks are, at this point, highly experimental. However, it’s important to begin these projects and collaborate with the community, because our ability to scale bitcoin or another virtual currency depends on a launch and learn approach.”\n\nBlockchain CEO Peter Smith concluded by saying:\n\n“Blockchain is committed to bringing our blockchain technology and the power of open finance to every corner of the world. This release takes us one step closer to realizing that ambition.”\n\nTransactions not currently enforceable\n\nHowever, one very important note is that until both CSV and SegWit are implemented on the Bitcoin blockchain, transactions are not enforceable at the bitcoin protocol level.\n\nTherefore, Blockchain says that “the current Thunder prototype is best suited for transactions among a trusted network of users and should not be used for real payments.”', 'This is quite surprising news, considering how several Bitcoin exchanges in the country have shut down in 2015.\n\nConsumers in Canada are looking for alternative payment options, as they seem to grow tired of cash payments. Contactless payments are doing quite well so far, and online payments are booming. But what is of real interest is how the usage of Bitcoin has doubled in 2015.\n\nSimilar to most countries around the world, Canadian consumers are flocking to cashless payment options. That being said, the usage of cash is starting to decline in the country, albeit it is not going at a fast pace. This does not come as a complete surprise, considering there are so many retailers where consumers are used to paying with cash, rather than cards or mobile solutions.\n\nCanada Likes Contactless And Bitcoin Payments\n\nA recent report, titled Canadian Payments Forecast – 2016, indicates the growth of contactless payments increased by as much as CAD 30 billion last year. Moreover, the report also mentions how there were over 1.2 billion contactless transactions in Canada alone in 2015.\n\nIt is well worth noting that individual merchants in Canada will not deal with contactless payment support just yet. Despite the growing demand by customers, these places have put up signs explaining they do not accept those types of transactions. If it were up to consumers, especially grocery stores, and supermarkets should embrace this payment solution, but they are the ones holding out the longest on doing so.\n\nContrary to most other countries in the world, five in six people with access to contactless payments in Canada use the option whenever they can. To put that into perspective, the monthly usage average is still only three times per month. Contactless payments still have a long way to go in this regard, but there is a noticeable trend.\n\nBut the most important finding of this survey is how Canadians seem to be warming up to the usage of Bitcoin as well. In fact, the study shows how usage of Bitcoin has doubled in Canada throughout 2015. This is rather surprising news, considering how several Bitcoin exchanges in the country have shut down in 2015. Cointrader closed its doors last year, and CaVirtex was acquired by Kraken several months ago as well. Additionally, Vault of Satoshi had to shut down as well due to profitability issues.\n\nThis news goes to show there is an increased demand for frictionless payment options in Canada. Bitcoin offers users exactly that, and at much cheaper rates than competing services. It is too early to tell if the usage of Bitcoin will continue to increase in Canada, but given the current price increase, that is not unlikely.\n\nSource: TSI Global Net\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Coinbase has introduced Coinbase Buy Widget to make it easier for users to buy bitcoin, the company announced in a blog. The hosted widget can be embedded and is configurable.\n\nThe widget enables users to buy bitcoin using debit cards, delivers bitcoin to a specified address instantly, and provides a seamless user experience.\n\nUsers can have bitcoin sent directly to the address the app provides.\n\nNew And Existing Users\n\nThe widget offers a debit card form and an easy way to create a Coinbase account that will be especially helpful to new users.\n\nExisting Coinbase users will be able to make purchases more easily.\n\nDevelopers will be able to allow their users to purchase bitcoin into their apps using a couple of code lines rather than a full-blown “OAuth” integration.\n\nThe widget gives new users an easy way to try more applications. It helps developers grow their communities, and it helps novel bitcoin-use cases succeed.\n\nHow To Set It Up\n\nIn initiating the widget, the user is greeted with an email field. The user is asked to log in or sign up with Coinbase.\n\nTo set up the widget, users can embed it into their own application with Coinbase’s Javascript SDK, or use a direct link and open it in a separate web view in either a new browser tab or in the web view on a mobile app.\n\nThree Partners Join Coinbase\n\nPartnering with Coinbase on the widget are Brave Browser, Hammercoin and PopChest.\n\nBrave users will be able to purchase bitcoin to support their preferred websites. Brendan Eich, CEO of Brave Software, said the company’s goal is to increase browsing speed and safety for users while supporting content creators. Brave wants users to bring their own bitcoin to self fund their wallets and micropay their preferred websites. He said the widget will make it easy for Brave users to purchase bitcoin.\n\n(The Brave browser blocks unwanted web ads and replaces them with Brave-generated ads, with the goal of making browsing easier, allowing users to see ads they are more likely to want to see, and to enable all parties to receive revenue in the process, CCN reported in January.)\n\nHammercoin, which makes BitQuest, a minecraft server with a bitcoin-denominated monetary system, believes the widget will provide a new minecraft experience. Cristian Gonzalez, CEO of Mego Games, a game creator, said the most commonly asked question about Hammercoin is how to get bitcoin. He said the widget provides a way to address this user need.\n\nPopChest is a new monetization model for video producers that has Coinbase-powered micropayments. Valerian Bennett, CEO at PopChest, said Coinbase opens micropayments to a whole new audience. He called the widget a game changer for PopChest since its viewers can immediately get the benefits of bitcoin without already being familiar with cryptocurrency.\n\nPopChest wants to make it easy for content developers to offer video in exchange for micropayments as opposed to only relying on advertising. “We don’t force viewers to watch commercials before seeing the video they really want,” he said.\n\nAlso read: Brave browser seeks to revamp web ad revenue model using cryptocurrency\n\nMore To Come\n\nThe widget is currently limited to customers in the United States using debit cards. To allow instant buys with limited KYC, the widget supports purchases up to $5 per day. Each user has a lifetime limit of $50, then they are asked to set up a Coinbase account. Coinbase will adjust the limitations and add more payment methods to increase limits in the future.\n\nCoinbase is seeking input from developers interested in working with the widget.\n\nImages from Coinbase.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A money-laundering case in Miami is expected to determine what the future of Bitcoin in the U.S. will be.\n\nA 32-year-old Florida man is charged with attempted money-laundering after illegally selling $1,500 in Bitcoins. The essential question is: was it really money he was laundering?\n\nThe verdict of Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler may serve as a landmark of what Bitcoin actually is from the US law’s viewpoint. It’s the fact that this is the first case of its kind which makes it so special.\n\nWhat are you Bitcoin?\n\nThe actual history of Bitcoin use and officials’ attempts to regulate it, is, to express it mildly, a mess. Some see Bitcoin as property, others as money, and even more as something in-between. Thus, the Internal Revenue Service in March 2014 issued the statement that “virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes”.\n\nIn line with that, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission found in September 2015 that “Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities.” However, in December 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its charges against two Bitcoin mining firms, described Bitcoin in the same way as U.S. dollars.\n\nBetween money and property\n\nOn the other hand, as long ago as March 2013, FinCEN suggested that an exchanger or administrator of some mysterious “virtual currency” which wasn’t referred to by name is an MSB (Money Service Business) under FinCEN’s regulations. That means these exchangers and administrators are subject to MSB registration and reporting regulations etc., while just “users” of MSBs are free of those. Only the line between the exchangers and users appears to be drawn in the sand.\n\nOn June 20th, the first Bitcoin auction in Australia is taking place in Sydney. Around 24,500 Bitcoins seized in late 2013 from a Melbourne drug dealer are going to be on sale. Auctioning Bitcoin off suggests that local authorities in Australia view Bitcoins as property, not money. While on the other hand, for instance, Japan does officially recognize Bitcoin and other virtual currencies as money.\n\nComic books for Professor Evans\n\nThis time around, the fate of a Florida man and the destiny of Bitcoin seem to be on a different set of scales. The defense and the prosecution have differing arguments over the cryptocurrency. Last Friday, Barry University economics Professor, Charles Evans, appeared in court as a defense witness testifying that Bitcoin isn’t really money, but rather something equivalent to poker chips or comic books.\n\nHowever, as the prosecution points out, one can pay with Bitcoins in some restaurants as you can do with money, but this is obviously not possible with comic books or poker chips. This would seem to suggest that Bitcoin is more equal to money. Professor Evans himself was even paid for attending court in Bitcoins.\n\nWhether Bitcoin will be defined as money in Florida or not – the verdict will play a noticeable role in future definitions and usage of Bitcoin. It seems as if something so big is going on that it is hard to predict what kind of movement the decision will cause around the world. Either way, it is going to add its own spice to the realm of uncertainty that envelops Bitcoin.\n\nRead more here.', 'Venture Capitalist firms have taken a liking to Bitcoin and invested millions of dollars into the industry in 2015, including some of Silicon Valley’s best-known venture firms.\n\nThe question is: Has there been a Bitcoin trickle down effect? But, first, let’s define a Bitcoin trickle-down effect. It’s not like Reaganomics, in the low tax, political sense.\n\nRather, a Bitcoin trickle-down effect is whatever the opposite of a few people accumulating and controlling all the coins and never spending them on anything that’s a net positive for anyone other than themselves.\n\nWith few people holding onto the greatest hoard of bitcoins, do those coins ultimately find their way in the hands of Bitcoin’s “poor? (who are probably actually quite rich all things considered). In other words, are those users who do not have a bunch of coins truly making considerable money or are the Bitcoin riches being enjoyed solely by VCs, owners and so on.\n\nThe data is scarce. What I can find is only anecdotal, having spoken with numerous people who work in the space. Most people are indeed receiving money from their own projects, the entrepreneurs. But, in terms of those people looking for gigs and jobs, the workers, Bitcoin velocity is slow.\n\nIt seems that there is no trickle down effect in Bitcoin thanks to Gresham’s Law, an economic principle that states: “When a government overvalues one type of money and undervalues another, the undervalued money will leave the country or disappear from circulation into hoards, while the overvalued money will flood into circulation.” People want to send PayPal payments instead of Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThis is, even more, the case when the price of Bitcoin rises, which leads people to hold onto bitcoins as opposed to spending them.\n\nSome posit that, because Bitcoin is innately deflationary, people with the most Bitcoin will automatically become richer meaning “they won’t have any reason not to” give back. This will depend on the individual, and time will tell how the percentages of altruistic vs. selfish Bitcoin whale’s plays out. Remember, Bitcoin is a taxless system. In the absence of taxes, a community must choose a charity, value exchange and employment or stall and be overtaken by other players.\n\nFor the poor bitcoiner, who cannot hold onto bitcoins for long enough to enjoy the theoretical appreciation, the deflationary nature of Bitcoin means nothing.\n\nMost startups fail within 18 months, even if they get money. The money misallocated and eventually many startups go bankrupt. In a lot of cases, unless the startup pays very well, the only ones who benefit monetarily from the failure of the startup are the investors and owners. With this in mind, there’s no “trickle-down” Bitcoin-style.\n\nFor now, those who enter the Bitcoin space are dependent upon those who have already been in the space. These so-called “workers” depend on the holders of Bitcoin to pay liquid Bitcoin (or fiat in many cases as ironic as that may be) while you’re working on building out the ecosystem (or not) in whatever way that may be. For all the discussion that Bitcoin is going to replace the traditional banking system, it’s hard to ignore that the Bitcoin money velocity is not overwhelming – that Bitcoin is hardly a competitor. What’s more accurate is Bitcoin is a harbinger for projects emanating from banking.\n\nAcademics Dániel Kondor, István Csabai and Gábor Vattay of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, and Márton Pósfai of Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest demonstrated that Bitcoin’s automatic evolution will likely benefit most the Bitcoin rich.\n\nThus, the fate of Bitcoin is up to those capstone wallet holders.

Ping21 sells uptime monitoring data, and can be run simultaneously, generating multiple income streams from a single device. “The Ping21 and Sensor21 releases are designed to get developers excited about future applications with the 21 library and marketplace,” Pate explains.\n\nOther than the hardware, a little coding knowledge is the only barrier to entry in order to make these projects work. They're as easy to deploy as simply adding the hardware, typing a few commands, and then choosing your price for the data.\n\nOnce a device is at full capacity a user can always add more inexpensive DIY 21 devices, or simply upgrade to a more powerful platform. The 21 operating system is already compatible with Mac OSX and Debian-Linux based systems. The company says that Windows, Android, and iOS are all in the works too.\n\nHowever, as there are currently only 83 apps in the entire decentralized marketplace, generally supplying one or two types of data, the pricing structure and viability of earning an income have yet to be proven.\n\nPate refers to the new data type being sold as “graph data,” which is, unlike cloud data, generated in a distributed manner. “Moving the collection of data from centralized organizations to individuals who can capitalize on geographic advantages is such a powerful concept,” he explained. “Eventually, the sensors themselves become commoditized, but the geographic location of the sensor holds all the monetary value.”\n\n- Tyler Pate\n\nGathering this kind of data may be core to 21 Inc.'s status as an Internet of Things hardware company. The Bitcoin incentive layer makes it much more likely that a large sampling of users will generate the data and sell it in an efficient manner. A peer to peer network with peer to peer money enables this level of data distribution, Pate explained, which opens up new doors and use cases we haven't imagined before.\n\nWith such a low barrier to entry, a range of new markets may arise “Take a use case where a car manufacturer like Tesla wants to get more information on usage of their vehicles,” Pate theorized. “A consumer could opt-in to anonymized data collection on usage statistics, and the car manufacturer can exchange this data for a small amount of bitcoin. It's very valuable data for training self-driving car algorithms, for example.”\n\n“This use case becomes so much more powerful when parking meters are also bitcoin enabled, and your car can then use the bitcoin earned to autonomously pay a parking meter to use the parking space,” says Pate.\n\n- Tyler Pate\n\nBefore graph data becomes big business, far more people will have to join the marketplace. One possible way that could happen is for entrepreneurs to sell appliances that are fully pre-configured, allowing anyone to plug them in and generate many small bitcoin income streams with no effort besides keeping them powered and online. “I could see this happening in the future,” Pate told BraveNewCoin.\n\n-Tyler Pate"", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

06/03/2016,"['The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ordered Bitfinex, a Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange, to pay $75,000 for offering illegal, off-exchange, financed retail commodity transactions in cryptocurrencies, and for failing to register as a futures commission merchant (FCM) as required by law, according to a CFTC press release.\n\nThe order requires the exchange to cease and desist from future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).\n\nCFTC Cites Dodd-Frank Act\n\nFrom April 2013 to at least February 2016, the CFTC found Bitfinex allowed users to borrow funds from one another to trade bitcoins on a margined, leveraged or financed basis. The commission further found the exchange did not deliver the bitcoins to the traders who bought them. Instead, it held the bitcoins in wallets that it owned.\n\nThe order noted that under the Dodd-Frank Act, financed commodity transactions must be conducted on an exchange unless the entity offering the transactions can establish that actual delivery of the bitcoins results within 28 days.\n\nThe CFTC cited a federal court ruling recognizing that “actual delivery” requires a transfer of “possession and control” of the commodity and providing “real and immediate possession to the buyer or the buyer’s agent.”\n\nFurther Violations Cited\n\nBy offering to enter into, execute, and/or confirm the execution of off-exchange, financed, retail commodity transactions, Bitfinex violated the requirement that such transactions must be conducted on a derivatives transaction execution facility or designated contract market.\n\nBecause the transactions did not result in actual delivery of bitcoins, Bitfinex could not rely on an exception to the CFTC’s jurisdiction over such transactions permitted under the law.\n\nCFTC further found Bitfinex accepted orders and received funds in connection with retail commodity transactions without being registered as an FCM, as required by law. FCMs include all persons engaged in soliciting or accepting orders for retail commodity transactions or who accept money in connection with such transactions, the order noted. Bitfinex has never been registered in such a capacity.\n\nAlso read: CFTC: BTC is a commodity\n\nCFTC Oversees Bitcoin Futures And Options\n\nThe CFTC last year recognized bitcoin as a commodity when it settled with a bitcoin exchange for trading option contracts after an enforcement case against a bitcoin operator, CCN reported in September. CFTC has the authority to oversee cryptocurrency futures and options. Bitcoin derivatives and futures platforms must register as a swap execution facility or designated contract market.\n\nThe CFTC recognized Bitfinex’s cooperation with the Division of Enforcement’s investigation. Bitfinex also voluntarily made some changes to its business practices to comply with the CEA, the order noted.\n\nThe CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Susan Gradman, Melissa Cavers, Scott Williamson, Michael Frisch and Rosemary Hollinger.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The price of bitcoin surged nearly 20% during the week ending 3rd June, rising to its highest point in 20 months. But what was the cause of the increase?\n\nMainstream media sources have largely attributed this sharp increase to demand from the Chinese market, prompted by yuan devaluation. But not everyone agreed with this explanation, as some market experts asserted that the rally was tied to other developments both within and outside of the digital currency ecosystem.\n\nXu Qing, a spokesperson for Huobi, painted a different picture. Though Xu represents one of the largest bitcoin exchanges by volume, accounting for 41.91% of this week’s trades, he saw the movement as part of a broader series of stresses on the Chinese financial markets.\n\nXu told CoinDesk:\n\n""The devaluation of RMB has some influence [on bitcoin’s recent rally]. [But] the domestic stock market has been weak since last September. A convenient alternative investment like bitcoin is easy to be accepted by the traders.""\n\nStill, other market observers were quick to stress that this was the predominant factor.\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, voiced support for the idea that concerns about yuan devaluation helped drive bitcoin prices higher, as panicking Chinese market participants bought into bitcoin to avoid losses.\n\n""The fears of a sharp yuan devaluation are rising. It was set off by the People\'s Bank of China weakening the yuan to the lowest levels since March 2011,"" Hayes told CoinDesk.\n\nCrying foul\n\nHowever, the developments in the Chinese markets seem to have once again opened a continued subject of debate in the bitcoin trading community, the perception that Asia-based exchanges are using unfair or illegal tactics to drive market activity.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations at bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk that in his view, this correlation with the yuan is being used to sell headlines, and that it may not paint a portrait of what is happening on the ground.\n\n""The theory that the Chinese are buying bitcoin due to yuan devaluation is a nice story to tell, but is in our view incomplete,” he told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n“Bitcoin is a speculative asset and Chinese residents who are looking to preserve the value of their holdings can turn to USD or EUR, which are much more stable currencies.""\n\nZivkovski said that he believes the bigger story is not negativity to the yuan, but rather improved market sentiment toward bitcoin. Data provided by Whaleclub suggests 94% of volume – as measured by position size – was long.\n\nIn other words, Zivkovski said that members of the largest trading community in bitcoin are increasingly optimistic bitcoin’s price will rise. Adding evidence to this claim is that the digital currency’s price broke through the psychologically important $500 level on 29th May, reaching its highest since August 2014.\n\nThese gains took place as Whaleclub data suggested long-short ratios surged to record levels of 15:1, which indicates market sentiment is bullish.\n\nEther attraction\n\nStill, there were other theories, including one that finds traders once again looking analytically at the relationship between bitcoin and ether, an alternative digital currency that has fast gained favor with traders due to the strength of its technology.\n\nJoe Lee, founder of derivatives trading platform Magnr, for example, said that he doesn’t believe China is more active in the bitcoin markets, and that ""interest in ether"" caused most of bitcoin’s weekly price increase.\n\nLee emphasized the relationship developing between the two assets, stating that ""bitcoin is now seen as a safe hedge and cash out mechanism for Ethereum investors."" He also described bitcoin as ""the main on-ramp to owning Ethereum and the most liquid trading pair into the new currency.""\n\nDaniel Masters, chief investment officer at Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund Plc., was more skeptical of this explanation, noting that those who buy bitcoin to purchase ether still need to offload the asset, which then depresses its value.\n\nAs far as the data goes, ether transaction activity fluctuated significantly during the week, as 24-hour volume reached a high of $292.7m, nearly four times as much as the closing value of $76.7m, CoinMarketCap data reveals. In addition, this volume dropped more than 30% week-over-week.\n\nPath ahead\n\nAs for the path ahead, there were observers who voiced a belief that bitcoin could enjoy further price increases in the short term amid bullish sentiment.\n\nHowever, the recent price increases could simply reflect a period of heightened volatility and could therefore fail to hold up.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, emphasized that he expects traders to perhaps begin looking for opportunities to short the market, or that pessimism may creep back into the minds of traders.\n\n""Going forward, I would expect bitcoin to test $500 on the downside before we get real stability,” he concluded.\n\nCharles L.

And that’s just scratching the surface: Worldwide, counterfeit fashion is estimated to be a $600 billion industry, and if U.S. customs figures are accurate, about 40% of all counterfeit goods are sneakers. That makes counterfeit kicks a $240 billion problem to sneaker makers like Nike, Adidas, Converse, and more.\n\nSo if you’re a small brand like Brooklyn-born Greats, and you’ve convinced NFL superstar Marshawn Lynch to endorse a pair of your sneakers, how do you prevent the $149 design from being counterfeited? You embrace technology popularized by Bitcoin to create 3-D printed smart tags that can track any pair of the new Greats x Beastmode 2.0 Royale Chukkah sneakers back to the factory–and which are impossible to fake.\n\nAnti-counterfeiting technology in the fashion world has traditionally relied on two things. First, manufacturing process: The more complicated it is to manufacture something, the harder it is for counterfeiters to duplicate that process cost effectively. But material science also plays a factor. Take Nike’s Flyknit shoes. The result of four years of research and development, Nike required entirely new machines to be built to Flyknit pairs of sneakers like socks. Consequently, Flyknits are right now pretty much the only sneakers on the market that experts can tell apart from a quality pair of counterfeits.\n\nBut in both material science and manufacturing, time is ultimately on the side of the counterfeiters. Any pattern that a licensed Chinese factory can mass produce, a counterfeit factory can also eventually make just as well, and at a cheaper price, since they don’t need to recoup marketing or R&D expenses. This makes counterfeiting in the sneaker world is particularly damaging, since the market puts such a premium on vintage kicks–shoes that are trivial for counterfeiters to fake after years of advances in material science and manufacturing.\n\nCompanies have tried to give buyers an assurance that they’re buying the real thing through elaborate seals and certificates of authenticity, but these too can be faked.\n\nTo break this pattern, Greats turned to two companies, Chronicled (a sneaker and fashion software authentication company) and Origin (a San Francisco 3-D printing manufacturer), to design smart tags for their new Beast Mode sneakers.\n\nEach 3-D printed smart tag has a unique identifying code stamped into it, linking it to a specific pair of shoes, but it’s what is inside this smart tag that really counts: a small encrypted NFC chip like the one found inside a modern passport, which can be tracked just by scanning it with your phone. Because this chip is baked into the smart tag during the 3-D printing process, it’s impossible to break it out of the plastic without destroying it. But none of this would matter without the software.', 'What is arguably the most exclusive blockchain industry conference, the Blockchain Summit, sponsored by the BitFury Group and MaiTai Global, kicks off its second annual event this Saturday on long-time innovator, futurist and entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson’s Necker Island in the Caribbean.\n\nI was honored to have been asked to moderate a panel there, with my lodging paid for by the BitFury Group.\n\nWhen I told some sources I was going, they said, “That officially makes you Bitcoin illuminati.”\n\nI’ll be using my access to the Bitcoin illuminati to launch a new Forbes podcast called “Unchained: Big Ideas From The Worlds Of Blockchain And Fintech,” which will release its inaugural sessions on Tuesday, June 14 and be available on iTunes.\n\nThis year, the notable attendees of the Blockchain Summit include Marietje Schaake, a member of the European Parliament whom the Wall Street Journal called “Europe’s Most Wired Politician;” Jim Newsome, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the New York Mercantile Exchange; and Beth Moses, aerospace engineer for Virgin Galactic.\n\n“Our emphasis for this year’s gathering is to bring some of the world’s top thinkers from diverse backgrounds – civil society, NGOs, business, technology, government – to this extremely special place known for free thinking and cutting-edge innovation to foster out-of-the-box thinking, imagine new frontiers and form new partnerships, projects and initiatives that will drive the future of this transformational technology,” BitFury chief executive officer Valery Vavilov said in a statement.\n\nThe agenda for the weekend is broken out into three main themes — finance, security and other blockchain applications. Jamie Smith, BitFury’s global chief communications officer, says, regarding the finance theme, “I use that term quite loosely, because I don’t just mean Wall Street, London or Hong Kong. I mean the movement of currency around the world and how that will affect that way people are brought into the larger economy and out of the shadows of being unbanked.”\n\nThe security theme will also look at issues of privacy and identity, and the applications beyond will include everything from land titles to voting to civil society to better governance to music rights, etc.\n\n“There’s a lot of time purposely built into the agenda for free discussion and not hard-core panels, but for people to spend recreational time together and talk,” says Smith. “It’s an intimate setting that allows people a wonderful opportunity to collaborate and share their ideas and have that beautiful ‘what if’ moment.” Some of the recreational activities include lemur feeding, kite surfing and snorkeling.\n\nLast year’s summit received some criticism for a heavily male attendance. This year, the organizers pushed for diversity, not just in gender but a variety of areas including professions, geography and industry. Other attendees include Zoe Keating, cellist and blockchain advocate; Katie Haun, assistant U.S. Attorney and digital currency coordinator for the U.S. Department of Justice, Sandra Ro, executive director and digitization lead at CME Group ; Mariana Dahan, senior operations officer at the World Bank; Matthew Roszak, cofounder of new enterprise blockchain company Bloq; Brian Forde, director of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative; and Laurent Lamothe, former prime minister of Haiti.\n\nLast year, one of the main outcomes from this gathering was the formation of the Blockchain Alliance, a forum for engaging law enforcement to help fight criminal activity on the blockchain. Director Jason Weinstein has told me previously the idea for the Alliance came from lessons learned from the development of the internet — that criminals adopt new technology first.\n\nThe Blockchain Alliance, which counts among its industry participants major Bitcoin and blockchain startups such as Coinbase and Circle, was an opportunity for the companies to show law enforcement that they are serious about compliance. Part of the alliance’s mission is also to educate law makers about the technology, and Weinstein and Alan Cohn, counsel for the Alliance, say that within just the last year, law enforcement has gone from approaching blockchain technology with trepidation to understanding how to use it for law enforcement.\n\nWe’ll see what new ideas and developments arise out of this year’s gathering. I’ll report back — and you can get a taste of life on a private island by listening to my first podcasts from Necker.\n\nUpdate, 9:45pm EST, June 3, 2016: This post has been corrected to show that aerospace engineer Beth Moses is not also an astronaut.', 'Dave Kleiman made a name for himself as a computer forensics expert before being claimed as co-inventor of Bitcoin by Craig Wright, the Australian recently verified by Gavin Andresen and Jon Matonis as Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe veteran Kleiman, if he were co-inventor of bitcoin, never used the fortune that would be his. His home was in foreclosure when he died.\n\nOf course, when Wright refused to verify cryptographically his place as Nakamoto, everything had been thrown into question.\n\nOf Wright, Andresen insisted: “He fits the style of person I was working with,” he said. “He can also say things that sound, at first, ridiculous…After spending time with him I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt: Craig Wright is Satoshi.” The Economist, one of the chosen papers, left room for doubt in Wright’s claims.\n\nRegardless, this gives us a chance to look closer into the life and career of Kleiman.\n\nAlso Read: Post-Mortem Of A Con: To Be Satoshi Nakamoto Or Not Be\n\nBorn in 1967, Kleiman was an adoptee and interested in computers and technology as a child. Despite acute knowledge of computers in the nineties, he worked in law enforcement in Florida. A 1995 motorcycle accident turned him further towards computers.\n\nHe appeared on various media programs and penned books about passwords and digital security. By the beginning of the 21st century, he wrote for the same security mailing list Satoshi Nakamoto used to introduce Bitcoin.\n\nGizmodo obtained an email in which Wright seemingly asks Kleiman to co-author the paper. “I need your help editing a paper I am going to release later this year. I have been working on a new form of electronic money. Bit cash, Bitcoin…” it reads. “You are always there for me Dave. I want you to be a part of it all.”\n\nKleiman’s friends are by no means convinced their friend and partner helped create Bitcoin. Though, both say he had the talents.\n\nGizmodo reportedly obtained “an unfinished draft of a trust contract showing Wright entrusting Kleiman with 1.1 million bitcoins in 2011.” That sum, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, was to be returned to Wright down the road.\n\nIn the following video, Kleiman appears on an ABC affiliate in Florida regarding a computer security breach in Florida. Two employees were charged with filing false claims of a security breach on a public system. Kleiman found that there was no unauthorized access and the employees who made the claims were fired.\n\nIn the following CNN interview, Kleiman discusses how common hacking is in reference to the Sarah Palin email hacking case in which her e-mail account had been compromised. Kleiman, an expert in password security, notes how common such breaches are.\n\nIn the following video, Kleiman was featured on CNN to discuss Facebook hacking in regards to a murder trial.\n\nIn the following video, Kleiman discusses copy machine hacking. He explains how each copy machine has a hard drive on the inside which contains all the documents which had ever been scanned. It is not all too uncommon for this to be stolen.\n\nDave Kleiman passed away as a result of MRSA. That, along with the disappearance of Wright, means the world may never truly know. His friends say that, if Kleiman was truly Nakamoto, they would not even bother trying to crack the security protecting his share of the Nakamoto fortune.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'European Parliament members (MEPs) voted to take a hands-off approach to regulating blockchain technology, Ars Technica reports. Following the vote, unnamed sources told Ars Technica that European Commission staffers are working hard to understand the distributed ledger technology behind virtual currencies ? seven years after the launch of Bitcoin, with venture capital investments now totalling more than €1 billion.\n\nThe MEPs voted in a proposal, set out in a resolution (a short summary is also available) drafted by Jakob von Weizsäcker, which suggests that a new task force, which would be overseen by the European Commission, should build expertise in the underlying technology of virtual currencies. The proposal, which was passed by 542 votes to 51, with 11 abstentions, will now be sent to the European Commission.\n\nThe original title of the EU Parliament’s press announcement ? “MEPs call for virtual currency watchdog to combat money laundering and terrorism” ? seems to indicate that the MEPs voted in favor of a heavy-handed approach to blockchain technology regulation. But, as rightly noted by International Business Times, the title is misleading. The press announcement combines two different initiatives. One is the creation of a Virtual Currency Task Force, and the other is the inclusion of virtual currency exchanges within the scope of the European Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Neither of these implies the creation of a new regulator as such.\n\nThe proposal clearly states that distributed ledger technology should not be stifled by regulation at this early stage. The new task force would also be tasked with recommending any necessary legislation, but the text warns against taking a heavy-handed approach to this new technology which, it says, can offer significant opportunities for the consumer and economic development.\n\n""To avoid stifling innovation, we favor precautionary monitoring rather than preemptive regulation. But IT innovations can spread very rapidly and become systemic. That\'s why we call on the commission to establish a task force to actively monitor how the technology evolves and to make timely proposals for specific regulation if, and when, the need arises,"" said von Weizsäcker.\n\n“What we advocate in the report is not to stifle innovation by regulating now, but instead to closely monitor what is going on by the creation of a task force which we suggest should be created at the level of the commission, and then to regulate ? if and when the time is right to do so and if and when the structures to do so are in place,” reads the short version of Weizsäcker’s report. “That of course doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t do anything right now. For example, in the report we greatly welcome the suggestion of the commission to apply the Anti-Money Laundering Directive immediately for virtual currencies.”\n\n""The starting point is not to regulate ? although you\'d be forgiven for thinking it was [to regulate] when you read the headline from the press release,” Siân Jones, of the European Digital Currency and Blockchain Technology Forum, told International Business Times. ""You might think here is Europe stepping in to regulate stuff, but actually if you read the report then you will realize that it\'s highly supportive. It\'s not proposing a watchdog body in the sense of a quango [quasi-autonomous, nongovernmental organization] or some other agency. The report definitely doesn\'t call for that kind of a body. The report is saying the EU is not trying to regulate virtual currencies in a day-to-day sense, but rather to allow the technology to continue to innovate.""\n\n“I agree that this is both an important and exciting area, and I welcome the very balanced approach to keep an eye on developments, embrace the opportunities, but be alert to the dangers,” said Finance Commissioner Jonathan Hill. “In recent months we have accelerated our work to examine whether it could be linked to funding terrorism activities.” Hill added that the EU Commission plans to set up a fintech task force.\n\nLike many official documents issued by EU authorities, this resolution has a relatively high degree of purposeful ambiguity, and can be interpreted in different ways. It appears that the EU authorities intend to keep all doors open at this moment, in such a way as to keep the EU innovation engine running while at the same time developing options to intervene rapidly in case of need. In fact, the resolution emphasizes the differences between smart regulation and a hands-off approach.\n\n“The key to smart regulation in such an environment of dynamic innovation is for the regulator to develop sufficient capacity, including technical expertise,” reads the full version of Weizsäcker’s report. “Preemptive and heavy-handed regulation that would stifle growth should and can be avoided. But such a smart regulatory regime based on analytical excellence and proportionality must not be confused with light-touch regulation. Rapid and forceful regulatory measures need to be part of the tool kit in order to address risks before they become systemic if and when appropriate.”\n\nPhoto David Iliff / Wikimedia', 'Microsoft has announced that it is collaborating with Blockstack Labs, ConsenSys and developers across the globe on an open source, self-sovereign, blockchain-based identity system that allows people, products, apps and services to interoperate across blockchains, cloud providers and organizations.\n\nThe United Nation\'s Sustainable Development Goals include giving everyone a legal identity by 2030. As a first step, the U.N. wants to develop scalable identity systems by 2020. The inaugural ""ID2020 Summit ? Harnessing Digital Identity for the Global Community,"" held at the United Nations headquarters in New York on May 20, brought together policymakers and technology companies to develop an action plan.\n\n“While we don’t profess to have solutions to these overwhelming problems today, we can start where the open source community is best: collaboration,” said Yorke Rhodes III, blockchain business strategist at Microsoft. “To progress toward these goals, we have been working with partners to address identity using the self-owned or self-sovereign qualities of blockchain technology.”\n\nThe Microsoft strategist said that the Redmond, Washington, giant is working with Blockstack Labs and ConsenSys to leverage their current Bitcoin and Ethereum-based identity solutions, Blockstack and uPort. Through this open source collaboration, Microsoft and its partners intend to produce a cross-chain identity solution that can be extended to any future blockchains or new kinds of decentralized, distributed systems. In the coming weeks an open-source framework for developers will be made available on Azure.\n\nBlockstack ? an open source blockchain application stack ? permits building decentralized, serverless apps by plugging into Blockstack\'s services for identity, naming, storage and authentication.\n\nAccording to the Blockstack team, Blockstack is the largest, most popular blockchain identity system, with 50,000 registered identities that come with profiles and globally unique names. Identities can be registered for people, companies, websites, software packages and more. Profiles can contain both private and public information, which is attested to by the user and can be verified by peers and select authorities.\n\n“Microsoft will make it easy to deploy new Blockstack servers and infrastructure on the Azure cloud and plans to integrate Blockstack with some internal systems for identity and authentication,” notes the Blockstack blog. “With the Blockstack technology users are in complete control of their usernames and data and don’t need to trust any third party for their information. We appreciate Microsoft’s committed to making the internet a more secure and user-centric place and to promote open-source software development.”\n\nIn November Bitcoin Magazine reported that Microsoft had partnered with ConsenSys, a blockchain startup focused on Ethereum technology, founded in October 2014 by Ethereum Foundation’s co-founder Joseph Lubin. In December, Microsoft and ConsenSys announced Ethereum Blockchain as a Service (EBaaS) on Microsoft Azure, to provide a single-click cloud-based blockchain developer environment to Azure Enterprise clients and developers.\n\nIn October, ConsenSys revealed that it was working on an identity management system called uPort . “[We] have started to integrate an ID and persona construct across all of our dApps,” noted the ConsenSys blog. “Soon a uPort persona will enable access to any dApp ConsenSys or other developers build. ConsenSys has begun efforts to work with various partners towards standardization of these components.” The company added that user-owned ID and data will be crucial for realizing the compelling vision of Web 3.0.\n\n“We’re also collaborating with ConsenSys on a cross-blockchain solution for global namespaces,” notes the Blockstack blog. “We believe that a global identity system should not be dependent on any particular blockchain and users should be able to migrate from one blockchain to another, if needed. Along these lines, we plan to work with ConsenSys to add Ethereum support to the Blockstack server.”\n\nRedmond Magazine notes that there are many unofficial identity systems in the social media world, including the systems operated by Google, Facebook and Microsoft itself, as well as various emerging blockchain-based platforms that have been proposed for the online world. But the U.N. and the companies that participated in the inaugural ID2020 Summit are more ambitious: They want to develop globally recognized identity systems for the real world.\n\nOne-fifth of the world’s population ? one and a half billion people ? are without proper identification, and 50 million children are born every year without a birth certificate and a legal identity. These numbers are growing, which underlines the importance of the U.N. goal of giving everyone on the planet a solid and tamper-proof digital identity based on common, interoperable standards. According to John Farmer, director of technology and civic innovation at Microsoft, blockchain technology can offer three key features to an identity system: It\'s an immutable, trustless, and transparent agreed-upon network.\n\n“[We] can imagine a world where an individual can register their identity in a cross blockchain fashion, providing a single namespace for lookup regardless of blockchain of choice,” concludes the Microsoft announcement. “[We are] excited by the potential societal benefits that can be derived from an identity that transcends borders, blockchains, organizations and companies.”', 'Uphold’s recent decision to enable Ether trading on its platform marks another sign of recognition by both the financial and the open source developer communities’ of Ethereum’s unique potential.\n\nCCN on Wednesday reported that Uphold users can now buy or convert fiat currencies (USD, EUR, and GBP) or other digital currencies, including bitcoin, to Ether, the token value of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWith its inclusion, Ether is now among 30 other currencies supported by the Uphold exchange. Uphold also announced a partnership with payroll service startup Bitwage to allow users to receive their wages in Ether.\n\nUphold’s Unique Offering\n\n“Uphold members can fund their accounts via bank transfer or credit/debit card (if using USD, EUR or GBP) – or from another member, instantly in any of the 30 currencies we support, even bitcoin, Litecoin or Voxel, directly between accounts,” Jorge Pereira, Uphold’s executive vice president and chief product and engineering officer, told CCN in interview. “After funding your account, you can create your own personal Ethereum money card and convert the amount you wish from the card of your choice.”\n\nUphold is the only platform that enables the free convertibility of bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.\n\nWhy Uphold Chose Ethereum\n\n“We chose to support Ether as a new cryptocurrency because of its growing popularity in the developer and open source communities as well as with financial traders and enthusiasts,” Pereira said. “We strive to create a seamless and inclusive financial platform where it’s free to hold, move, convert and transact in any form of currency or commodity.”\n\n“That’s why this year so far, we’ve already launched support for the Voxel, the in-game currency for VR (virtual reality) content platform Voxelus, as well as Litecoin in addition to Ethereum,” Pereira added.\n\nMore Innovation Coming\n\nUphold embraces the underlying principles of innovation, such as open source development, bitcoin and other blockchain-based technologies, such as Ethereum, he noted. “We believe in their potential for disruption in the financial sector. While there are no immediate plans we can share just yet, we continue to look into new ways to offer our members every conceivable form of currency.”\n\n“Uphold is reimagining the world of money and finance from the ground up,” said Anthony Watson, Uphold CEO. “We want to change and transform the splintered world of finance – from basic banking needs, payments and money transfer to the global financial ecosystem itself.”\n\nAlso read: Uphold partners Bitwage to enable Ether payroll\n\nWhy Bitwage Chose Ethereum\n\nThe Uphold-Bitwage partnership will offer users the option to obtain payroll payments in Ether, with no bank account information nor employer sign up necessary.\n\nJonathan Chester, president of Bitwage, gave CCN his perspective on the respective uses for bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n“For the time being, workers who want Ethereum are all speculators who want to become a part of the smart contract and decentralized autonomous organization revolution,” Chester said. “This represents a stark contrast to bitcoin users, who are either speculating on bitcoin as being a new reserve currency or actually leveraging bitcoin for faster, cheaper international payrolls, where the user ends with local currency. That last use case is actually currently a majority of Bitwage’s volume.”\n\nBitwage utilizes Uphold’s open API, so when Uphold went live with Ether, “the gates of Bitwage also opened for this function,” Chester said. However, leading up to the launch, both Uphold and Bitwage have had continuous requests to support Ether from their respective members.\n\nThe choice between bitcoin and Ether would be by request from the employee, not the employer, Chester said.\n\n“It is easy for the employer to comply as Bitwage is simple and easy for any company to implement through compatibilities with most payroll, such as ADP and gusto, and freelance marketplaces, such as upwork,” he said. “Bitwage benefits employers through reduced payroll costs, increased transfer speeds, especially in the cases of international wage payments, and a trackable payroll process for employers and workers.”\n\nIt is less likely that an employer will require an employee to be paid solely in bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency via Bitwage, Chester said. However, Bitwage also supports local currencies, other than bitcoin and Ether.\n\nBorderless Payroll?\n\n“We envision a world of low cost, fast, borderless payroll where, with Bitwage Cloud Savings, employees and contractors all around the world can avoid the limitations enforced by the traditional banking infrastructure by harnessing the efficiency and freedom of bitcoin held in the currency of their choosing,” Chester noted in an earlier blog post.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Uphold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Anthony Di Iorio was a founding member of the team that built Ethereum, a network similar to bitcoin but with a Turing-complete coding language that has jumpstarted a still-nascent ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nIn those early days, the founders already had aspirations to someday convert the Ethereum Foundation that helps oversee the codebase into the ultimate decentralized group, better known nowadays as a distributed autonomous organization, or DAO.\n\nBut now that DAOs are real – and one has raised more than $150m worth of the cryptocurrency ether – Di Iorio says he has no plans to convert his own company, Decentral, into this kind of organization.\n\nDi Iorio told CoinDesk:\n\n""I think that this structure is very bold and it’s not something I would be doing with my company. I believe actually in leadership. I believe you need to make quick decisions.""\n\nGovernance questions\n\nInstead of a single leader, decentralized autonomous organizations are essentially bundles of smart contracts capable of automatically executing whatever digital commands are encoded into their makeup.\n\nAnyone can become a voting member of the DAO by buying tokens in exchange for ether that gives them a say in the decision a DAO makes, ranging from allocating resources to splitting off into a new organization. The largest of these, called simply The DAO, has raised funds and distributed tokens to 23,000 different voting addresses.\n\nDi Iorio believes that a system of widely dispersed voting rights granted based on whoever is willing to spend the most on tokens — 50 addresses own 41% of the tokens, according to public data — isn’t the most efficient way to run a company.\n\nHe\'s not alone. Last month, prediction market startup Gnosis proposed rebuilding The DAO’s governance model to give experts the ability to vote based on their confidence in an outcome inspired by a model called Futarchy.\n\nShortly thereafter, another governance-focused startup, Backfeed, also submitted its own reimagined DAO voting structure, which it dubbed a “social operating system” designed to help large groups collaborate more effectively.\n\nThis concern appears to extend to vote-holders of The DAO itself. At the top of the recently released DAO.report data website, which showcases funding proposals in order of popularity, is an ongoing vote for a moratorium on further proposals until the governance model is “upgraded”.\n\nHybrid model\n\nBut Di Iorio’s objections to the DAO model go beyond the technical components of the governance model.\n\nIn addition to legal and regulatory concerns he has about the model, Di Iorio, who earlier this year started a new position as the chief digital officer of the Toronto Stock Exchange, believes companies should work together in-person.\n\nDi Iorio told CoinDesk:\n\n""I think working in one room is very important. Working all at the same time is very important, we’re extremely efficient and we’ve shown that we can create products.""\n\nDi Iorio says he\'s moving to put these thoughts into practice. He expects Decentral will begin work on a project to merge the DAO model with a more traditional leadership-based model following a string of product launches expected to culminate on Wednesday.\n\nStill in its early planning phases, the Collaborative Leadership Intensive Organization (CLIO) is expected to be a hybrid organization designed to provide a “gradual” transition to distributed governance models where stakeholders have more control over decisions. At the same time, final decisions will still fall to a single chief executive.\n\nIn spite of his skepticism about launching a DAO himself, Di Iorio calls the idea “fantastic” and is moving to integrate aspects of the project through Jaxx, the cryptocurrency wallet software his company produces.\n\nLater today, the wallet is expected to integrate support for the vote tokens tied to The DAO, in addition to bitcoin and ethers. Next week, developers plan to offer greater functionality that lets Jaxx users view DAO proposals and vote on those proposals from within the app itself.\n\nDecentral team image via Facebook\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

06/04/2016,"['As the block mining reward halving event approaches, many people in the bitcoin space are excited because of the potential for an increase in the digital currency\'s price.\n\nOne miner, though, has expressed serious concern that, when the drop in the block subsidy occurs, it could trigger a chain of events that could lead to an inevitable hard fork.\n\nChandler Guo is the co-founder of Bitbank, a China-based digital currency company that runs one of the largest mining operations in the world, BW. On average, BW.com accounts for approximately 10% of the total hashrate, an impressive feat considering it launched only two years ago.\n\nGuo said he fears that if the price of bitcoin does not appreciate significantly before or immediately after halving, too much hashrate will drop off the network due to unprofitable mining, making transaction verification virtually impossible.\n\nHe said:\n\n“If the price doesn’t go up very quickly, up two times, it means a lot of the older machines will be shut down. They must shut down.”\n\nBitcoin halving is a roughly once-every-four-year event whereby the consistent supply of bitcoin released is cut in half. When pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin in January 2009, each block generated a reward of 50 BTC. On 28th November, 2012, nearly four years after the bitcoin blockchain was first launched, the reward subsidy fell by half to 25 BTC.\n\nSatoshi added halving so that the code could continue to provide fresh bitcoins as the network scaled, but would also phase out the production of new bitcoin as it approached the maximum cap of 21 million. However, that sudden drop can shock miners that operate with low profit margins.\n\nGuo believes that miners using less efficient hardware will be forced to drop off the network when the subsidy falls.\n\n“There will be 300 petahash of older machines that shut down immediately. They don’t need to work anymore; they just shut down,” he said.\n\nHe went on to explain:\n\n“When halving come[s], for the Avalon A3, Bitminer S3, the cost of the electricity is the same, so it must shut down. For example, the S3 is working 24 hours, they cost $1, for example, and they can mine $1. So if mining equipment can only mine the electricity payment, they don’t need to work.”\n\nHardfork for difficulty\n\nMiners make money by generating more income than they spend on electricity and the associated costs of running a network of machines that are always churning away. Maximizing profit in bitcoin mining is all about how much hardware someone can throw at trying to solve the next block.\n\nThe more hashing power, the more likely a miner is going to succeed on a regular basis.\n\nTo solve this problem, Nakamoto included a difficulty equation in the code so that every 2,016 blocks, the code analyzes how much hashing power is on the network and increases – or decreases – the difficulty. Over the past year, the difficulty has increased significantly as more hardware was added to the network.\n\nThe reason Guo is so concerned is because of the hard coded time by which difficulty is calculated. If more hashing power was added to the network tomorrow, blocks might be found sooner, increasing profitability for miners and speeding up the time at which difficulty is recalculated. However, if hashing power were to be removed, the opposite occurs.\n\nGuo explained that if a large number of miners are taken offline, it will reduce a significant amount of the total hashing power which, in turn, will slow down when the next difficulty event occurs.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“When the difficulty doesn’t change, but the hashing power shuts down immediately, there will be no next block. If, after the halving, the price does not go up, but the prices goes down, [there] will be heartache. It means no next block, no blockchain, all of the blockchain will be shut down immediately.”\n\nIn other words, because the difficulty won’t change for 2,016 blocks, if 300 petahash were to drop off the network, that would slow down the time between each block.\n\nThat slowdown could translate into slower transaction times, creating major headaches for people looking to broadcast transactions. In one worst-case scenario, this situation would lead to a crisis of confidence in the digital currency, potentially resulting in a sell-off. Lower bitcoin prices could result in even more miners shutting down their hardware, sparking a vicious cycle.\n\nTo get around this, Guo believes that there will need to be a hard fork to essentially reset the difficulty.\n\n“Some mining pool, together, will change to another chain, to change the difficulty to another chain. [A] hard fork is coming, it’s bad news and the price will crash down again,” he said.\n\nSkepticism of severity\n\nThere are others in the community, however, who are not nearly as concerned about the halving as Guo. In their eyes, because a halving event has already occurred once without destroying the network, they feel comfortable heading into this next event.\n\nEric Lombrozo, a contributor to the open-source Bitcoin Core developer team and founder of Ciphrex, told CoinDesk:\n\n“I do not believe the halving will have nearly as big an impact on the network as some have predicted. We’ve already had a halving in the past…and we’ve also seen significant sudden drops in bitcoin price – both of these situations imply lower short-term miner revenue. In neither case did we see a significant drop in hashrate.”\n\nThe idea is that miners have enough financial dry powder that they can stomach any drops in the block subsidy as the market tries to determine the new price of bitcoin with supply cut in half.\n\nBobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, which runs the third-largest bitcoin mining pool with approximately 16% of the hashrate, agrees that there will be a drop in hashrate. However, he doesn’t believe it will be as significant as Guo predicts.\n\n""After mining, for sure the hashrate will come down a bit, it will probably come down by 5-10%. It won’t come down by more than 30%,"" he told CoinDesk. ""We’ve seen it in other cryptocurrencies that at a block halving, the hashrate does come down. That’s expected.""\n\nHe went on to explain that he doesn’t see this as any sort of existential crisis for bitcoin and compared it to Donald Trump, the controversial American businessman who is currently seeking the US presidency.\n\n“For people who dislike Trump, they think it’s a huge crisis. But after a few weeks, it calms down,” he explained.\n\nBitFury, a mining company with approximately 10% of the hashrate, said that as a company, it\'s not concerned about the halving.\n\n""The important point is that the hashrate decline will not compromise the security of the network and will not make it susceptible to attack. We also firmly believe the upcoming halving event is good for the industry because it will motivate Bitcoin companies to innovate,"" said Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury, referencing the Lightning Network, Segregated Witness, and sidechains as recent developments.\n\nOthers believe that hashrate will actually increase soon after halving, leading to a more difficult mining environment.\n\nTerrence Thurber, co-founder and CEO of Oregon Mines, a bitcoin mine hosting provider, explained that he agrees that the hashrate could drop by 10% immediately after halving, with up to a 30% drop in the short-term. But in the long term, he said, newer equipment will make up for that lost capacity.\n\nHe said:\n\n“New generation equipment, such as Bitmain’s model S9, has the ability to quickly add hashrate which, absent changing other factors, would increase difficulty to the point where older generation miners are no longer profitable at most electricity price points.”\n\nNo concerns – if the price rises\n\nObviously, none of this is a problem if the price were to rise heading into the subsidy halving, because more miners would maintain profitability even if the number of bitcoins generated by each block drops by half.\n\n""After halving, it will be difficulty if the price does not go up,"" said Guo. ""Today, it is still perfect. It’s an old story and when the price goes up, it will be the next story.”\n\nThurber told CoinDesk that, if bitcoin behaves like other commodities, the price should increase as the supply decreases. If this is the case, then the price would increase enough to offset the loss in supply and even out overall demand.\n\n“Using traditional economic theory, the combination of bitcoin price and difficulty should balance out to basically return the market to the same position it was immediately prior to halving. Thus, if difficulty remained constant, the pre-halving price would double,” Thurber said.\n\nAt the same time, Thurber tempered that theory by saying that the final outcome might be entirely different, concluding:\n\n“Of course, bitcoin is a new commodity and doesn’t fit traditional models well.”\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Right now, we look at them as akin to remittance companies,” Espenilla said.\n\nThe Philippine central bank revoked the license of Philrem Service Corporation, a remittance company that anti-money laundering investigators said was used to transfer some of the $81 million hackers looted from the Bangladesh central bank.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Council issued a complaint against Philrem on April 28, accusing it of hiding the money trail via a web of transfers and currency conversions through Philippine bank accounts, before moving the cash through casinos in Manila and junket operators.\n\nPhilrem has denied any wrongdoing.

The last 10 daily candles are impressive and suggesting that the BTC bulls are in control. The price broke an important resistance area near $550, which may now act as a support area if BTC/USD moves down from the current or higher levels. As mentioned, there is a bullish trend line formed on the daily chart (data feed from Bitstamp) of BTC/USD, which acted as a reason for the upside surge.\n\nNow let us look at how far the price can move? I think there are high chances of the price breaking the all-important $600 level. If we look at the last wave, then the 1.618 extension of the last drop from the $500 high to $295 low is around the $625 level. So, I think the price may test the mentioned extension, and may even break it in the near term.\n\nThe price is also well above the 100-day simple moving average, which is a bullish sign and may lift the market sentiment further.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\nDaily MACD – The MACD is strongly bullish and calling for more gains in BTC/USD.\n\nDaily RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is around the overbought levels, which may ignite a minor downside reaction as a correction.\n\nMajor Support Level – $550\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $600\n\nCharts from Bitstamp; hosted by Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Read more...\n\nThe Bitcoin community across the world is currently witnessing the rise of Bitcoin for the second consecutive week now. Bitcoin price has increased by from somewhere around $450 per bitcoin to close to $600 per bitcoin in the past two weeks. The upward movement of bitcoin value has increased confidence on the digital asset among investors.\n\nThe increased confidence is not only visible in the trade volumes of the digital currency across various exchanges but also in the current demand for bitcoin liked assets. One of the well-known bitcoin-linked asset, GBTC which happens to be the share of Greyscale Venture’s Bitcoin Investment Trust has seen a significant increase in the value, thanks to the surging bitcoin price. According to market data, the value of one bitcoin, based on the underlying bitcoin per share ratio stands at around $933.50, which is 60 percent higher than the actual market rates of bitcoin.\n\nThe current value of GBTC signifies the willingness of investors to bet heavily on the digital currency which has had its ups and downs in the past and known for its price volatility. GBTC is Bitcoin Investment Trust’s publicly quoted security, the first of its kind which is solely invested and derived from the price of bitcoin.\n\nWith GBTC, investors gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin through a traditional investment vehicle, which is a perfect combination for those who believe in old school ways of investment. GBTC further removes the challenges that come with buying, storing and securing the digital currency itself. Each GBTC is worth about 0.0948 bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust’s securities are available for trade on OTC Markets, under the OTCQX marketplace. The OTCQX marketplace uses Alternative Reporting Standards, allowing investors to trade the securities using brokerage accounts at market prices. Accredited investors, on the other hand, can buy share shares directly from Bitcoin Investment Trust at a daily Net Asset Value (NAV) which is close to the actual price of bitcoin at that time.\n\nThe trading price of GBTC on OTC Markets is currently the highest, the bitcoin-linked investment vehicle has ever seen since it was released for public trading in the month of April last year. According to the stocks quote on Wall Street Journal, GBTC currently has a market capitalization of $123.39 million with total outstanding shares of over 1.4 million.\n\nWith bitcoin price expected to continue on an upwardly trend, we can expect more interest among traditional investors to but GBTC assets. Those willing to look beyond the traditional investment game will probably make a switch from GBTC to actual bitcoins.', 'It seems people are speculating on the current location of the missing in action Bitcoin developer and creator of Dark Wallet Amir Taaki. The British-Iranian Taaki has been somewhat of a legend within cryptocurrency circles for his work on the project as well as his views of crypto-anarchy. Recently it has been suggested that Taaki is running with an Anarcho-socialist group called “Rojava The Plan.” The organization’s mission is to create a self-sufficient socialist coop with a 1-year goal to finish “26 projects and advance Rojava’s decentralized economy.”\n\nAmir Taaki is considered a misfit when it comes to the Bitcoin community due to his strong beliefs in left-anarchism and his critical opinions against the growing industry. He is very well known for starting the project Dark Wallet with the help of Cody Wilson founder of Defense Distributed. Taaki was the original creator of Bitcoin BIP proposals, and the first one was a description of the GitHub plan which is a request to make changes to the code. Taaki also created the bitcoin protocol named libbitcoin, and worked on the bitcoin client Electrum among many other projects within the cryptocurrency community. In 2014 Taaki was one of the top 30 Forbes entrepreneurs named that year but soon after he left the Bitcoin community and seemed to want nothing to do with it. Taaki told Bitcoin Magazine journalist Aaron van Wirdum in October of 2014:\n\n“Well, a lot of people within the Bitcoin-community care about mass adoption way too much. They want to reach it at any and all cost. It doesn’t matter to them how much compromise we need to make, because they think Bitcoin will hit some critical point where – BAM – everything is revolutionized. This kind of quick fix mentality is very easy for people to grasp, but is not based around real social change. It’s an illusion.”\n\nMany in the industry have distanced themselves from his name and not just because of his anarchist beliefs. Taaki was suspected of being involved with the Bitcoinica hack that resulted in the loss of a lot of Bitcoins in July of 2012. Taaki has denied being involved in the theft and even said he warned people about the problems before hand. In Nathaniel Poppers popular book Digital Gold mentions Taaki but the author revealed a lot was taken out of the story in regards to the misfit hacker as told in the Motherboard column “The Anarchist Hacker Bitcoin Would Rather Not Talk About.”\n\nFor a while now Taaki has gone missing and has ducked out of the media spotlight. Dark Wallet has been left unfinished, and many wondered what the hacker has been up to. The last sighting of Taaki was last year and said he resided in an anarchist squat in the former G8 HQ building in London. Now skeptics believe he is helping Rojava The Plan with their decentralized economy mission. The goals of the group are being crowdfunded which include organic fertilizer production, a revolution media outlet, an internet and telephone infrastructure, natural medicine, 3D printing for the wounded, and Kurdish Ubuntu among others on the roadmap.\n\nIt’s not confirmed whether Amir is backing this project or volunteering his efforts towards it. However, the project is very much aligned with his Anarcho-socialist ideology and goals towards genuine decentralization in this world. Interestingly enough a hacker group just made headlines for sending “stolen Bitcoins” to the Rojava organizations donations. The hackers did not reveal who the victims were but call themselves the “Gamma Group.” Rojava received €10,000 (about £8,000) and Gamma Group called the autonomous region “one of the most inspiring revolutionary projects in the world today.”\n\nTaaki will always be known as a revolutionary spirit by those who agree and even disagree with his ideology. Rojava seems like a project he would back and it is unclear if he will come out of hiding and tell his location and show his latest efforts. There are not too many individuals like Taaki as he is unique and to some very inspiring. One thing is for sure He doesn’t fit with the current “banks love blockchain” mentality that’s risen in popularity throughout 2015. As the developer explained in 2012:\n\n“I’m not a business guy, I’m a coder.”\n\nSource: Reddit, Bitcoin Magazine, Motherboard and Wiki Commons\n\nImages: Motherboard, Wiki Commons, and Rojava The Plan', 'SatoshiLabs newly-announced TREZOR Password Manager will store and manage passwords securely and is available for public beta testing for all TREZOR hardware owners, the company announced on Medium. A Chrome extension is available.\n\nThe new password manager uses advanced cryptography. A user can encrypt each password entry using their personal TREZOR device. The password manager automatically uploads the encrypted data to the user’s private cloud storage, where it is available as needed.\n\nNo Master Password\n\nTREZOR now addresses the most pressing flaw in password managers, the chance that the master password will unlock the entire database. An attacker can gain access to stored data in the password manager should there be keylogger malware running on someone’s computer. Stolen login credentials are often sold on the black market.\n\nSecond-factor authentication via an email or an app provides an extra security layer, but this can cause discomfort. Biometric authentication can be dangerous. Should a fingerprint be compromised, an attacker can use it repeatedly without the possibility of change.\n\nThe TREZOR device itself acts as a second-factor authenticator. It unlocks the passwords without any need for third party authentication apps or access to email or a mobile phone. Rather than typing a master password to unlock the password database, the user simply “unlocks” the device using a secure PIN entry that is protected from keyloggers.\n\nThe PIN additionally prevents improper physical access.\n\nStored Passwords Stay Safe\n\nEven in cases where a Dropbox account is hacked, it is nearly impossible to read the stored passwords. TREZOR provides still another security layer by encrypting the password entries one by one with a unique encryption key derived from TREZOR.\n\nThe password manager serves as a showcase for approaching individual cloud storage security.\n\nThe password manager automatically syncs each password entry to a user’s private Dropbox account. This provides availability from any online computer. More cloud storage options will slowly be added.\n\nTREZOR devised an easy way to securely and privately back up the device. The user, during initial setup, is prompted to record and store a backup sentence consisting of 24 words.

Many debates about the nature of smart contracts are really just contests between competing terminology.\n\nThe different definitions usually fall into one of two categories. Sometimes the term is used to identify a specific technology – code that is stored, verified and executed on a blockchain. Let’s call this type of definition “smart contract code”.\n\nOther times, the term is used to refer to a specific application of that technology: as a complement, or substitute, for legal contracts. Let’s name these “smart legal contracts”.\n\nUsing the same term to refer to distinct concepts makes answering even simple questions impossible. For instance, one question I’m often asked is simply: what are the capabilities of a smart contract?\n\nIf we are talking about smart contract code, then the answer depends on the capabilities of the language used to express the contract and the technical features of the blockchain on which it operates.\n\nBut if we are asking about using that technology to create a binding legal agreement, or an effective substitute for a binding legal agreement, the answer depends on far more than the technology. This answer depends on existing legal doctrine and how our legal, political and commercial institutions decide to treat the technology. If businesspeople don’t trust it, the legislature doesn’t recognize it and the courts can’t interpret it, then it won’t be a very practically useful “contract”.\n\nIt would be futile to try and change the way people use the term already. Practically speaking, we are probably stuck using – or at least reading – the term “smart contract” for now. This makes it essential for anyone interested in this space to understand the different ways the term is used and be able to distinguish clearly between them.\n\nSmart contracts as smart contract code\n\nBlockchains can run code. While the first blockchains were designed to perform a small set of simple operations – mainly, transactions of a currency-like token – techniques have been developed to allow blockchains to perform more complex operations, defined in full-fledged programming languages.\n\nBecause these programs are run on a blockchain, they have unique characteristics compared to other types of software. First, the program itself is recorded on the blockchain, which gives it a blockchain’s characteristic permanence and censorship resistance. Second, the program can itself control blockchain assets – i.e., it can store and transfer amounts of cryptocurrency. Third, the program is executed by the blockchain, meaning it will always execute as written and no one can interfere with its operation.\n\nTo developers and others working directly with blockchain technology, the term “smart contracts” is most often used to refer to this blockchain code. You’ll see this use of the term in the Ethereum documentation, on stackexchange and in technically minded articles. The term has been particularly associated with the Ethereum project, whose primary purpose is to be a platform for smart contract code. But today, the term is used generically across the community to refer to any complex program that is stored and executed on a blockchain.\n\nCalling these programs contracts is helpful in that this code is governing something important or valuable. We only go to the trouble of creating a binding contract when it’s important that we be able to enforce the terms. Similarly, we only use smart contract code when the code controls something important, like money or identity.\n\nThat said, smart contract code need not resemble anything we would ordinarily think of as a “contract”. While the code could articulate a conditional financial transaction (“send 1 BTC from Alice to Bob on July 1, 2016”), it could also be a governance application that controls account permissions (“if Alice has voted yes, remove Bob’s voting rights over Application X and notify the following accounts…”).\n\nIn many cases, smart contract code is not used in isolation but as a small piece in a larger application. Every DApp, DAO, or other blockchain-based application is built using smart contract code to perform operations on their chosen blockchain. Any Ethereum application that you’ve read about – like Augur, Slock.it, or Boardroom – is made out of smart contract code.\n\nImperfect, misleading, and someday outdated\n\nThe term receives a lot of valid criticism. Relying on the metaphor of a “contract” is misleading because it emphasizes a single narrow use case. The term fails to capture one of the key capabilities of blockchain programs: that they have a kind of independent agency.\n\nSmart contract programs can themselves hold balances of cryptocurrency, or even control other smart contract programs. Once they are created, they can act autonomously when called to perform an action. For this reason, many prefer the term “smart agent”, analogous to the more general concept of a software agent.\n\nEventually, this use of the term may simply fade from use as blockchain technology matures.\n\nDevelopers will be more likely to refer to a specific language (“Let’s look at your Solidity code”) or platform (“Our application runs on Eris.db”) that they are working with, as opposed to a generic term that could describe any complex operation on a blockchain.\n\nThe capabilities and purpose of smart contract code as distinct from other code may simply become clear from context, without requiring the use of a clumsy analogy like “contract”. It might end up being more similar to how we speak of HTML and JavaScript today, without having to think about how the former is a “markup” language, playing a distinct role from JavaScript in the overall web application.\n\nSmart contracts as smart legal contracts\n\nAmong those who work in finance or law, the term “smart contract” is often read quite differently than the definition above.\n\n“Smart contract” here refers to a specific use case of smart-contract code – a way of using blockchain technology to complement, or replace, existing legal contracts. This is the definition of the term I considered in my last piece: the use of code to articulate, verify, and enforce an agreement between parties. A smart legal contract.\n\nThese smart legal contracts would most likely be a combination of smart contract code and more traditional legal language. For instance, imagine a supplier of goods enters into a smart legal contract with a retailer. The payment terms could be defined in code and executed automatically when delivery is made. But the retailer would likely insist the contract include an indemnity clause, whereby the supplier agrees to indemnify the retailer against claims flowing from a defective product. There would be no point representing this clause in code, since it is not something that can self-execute – it exists to be interpreted and enforced by a court in the case of litigation.\n\nCommercial agreements are full of boilerplate clauses that protect parties from various edge-case liabilities, and these are not always suitable for representation and execution through code, meaning that smart legal contracts will require (at least for the foreseeable future) a blend between code and natural language.\n\nThis is the basic idea behind Eris Industries’ dual integration system, Primavera de Fillipi’s proposed Legal Framework for Crypto-Ledger Transactions, and R3’s Corda smart contracts system.\n\nCould smart legal contracts ever be considered legally enforceable? Probably. Despite what many think, the conditions under which an agreement becomes a legally enforceable contract are flexible and attuned to the underlying relationship between the parties, rather than dependent on the form the contract takes. Anything from a verbal agreement to an email conversation can become a contract at law, if the basic elements of a contract can be found.\n\nMany contracts, many use cases\n\nThe category of smart legal contracts is complicated by the fact that there are many different types of contracts in the world, only some of which are obvious candidates for use as “smart contracts”. A legal contract could be anything from a verbal agreement for someone to paint your house to a derivative traded electronically in financial markets.\n\nSince early 2015, the use cases attracting the most attention are smart legal contracts as smart financial instruments like shares, bonds, or derivatives contracts. Articulating these contracts in code could allow financial markets to become more automated and simplify many process-intensive systems related to trading and servicing of financial instruments.\n\nThese “smart financial instruments” do not exist at scale today, although many people are working to build them. R3’s recently announced Corda platform is designed to facilitate this type of smart-contract. Digital Asset Holdings recently acqui-hired Elevance, a Swiss firm that has developed a way to model financial agreements in code. In April, Barclays’ revealed details of a scheme, in cooperation with R3, to represent ISDA agreements in smart contract code.\n\nFinancial instruments are just one type of contract that could benefit from blockchain code. As the technology matures, other assets – e.g. real estate, or intellectual property – may be stored and traded over blockchain systems. As new asset types go “on-chain”, the agreements used to govern those assets in the world today (like a mortgage or licensing agreement) may benefit from blockchain-based analogs.\n\nAlternatives to traditional legal agreements\n\nMany advocates for blockchain technology see larger possibilities. Rather than merely imitate or complement the legal contracts we use today, perhaps smart contract code could be used to facilitate new types of commercial arrangements.\n\nWe might even call this a third definition of the term: using smart contract code to create novel, alternative forms of agreements that are nonetheless commercially useful. Let\'s call these ""smart alternative contracts"".\n\nThis approach takes a broader view of the real-world problem solved by contracts. Commerce depends on individuals being able to form stable, predictable agreements with one another. Contracts, along with a strong legal system, are the primary mechanisms we use to shape each party’s incentives to the point where they have sufficient confidence in their relationship to engage in the risky business of trade.\n\nBut perhaps legal agreements are not the only solution to this general problem. Smart contract code offers a new set of tools to articulate and enforce terms, and they can be used to create systems of incentives that may be sufficient to make commercial relationships possible.\n\nThe most widely discussed opportunity of this type is machine-to-machine commerce. The growing ecosystem of smart devices – particularly those that are in some fashion autonomous – will eventually need a way to engage in basic commercial interactions with one another. For instance, a washer that buys its own detergent or a car that can pay to recharge itself.\n\nThese transactions still require a minimum level of trust to be commercially viable, but are ill-suited for legal contracts, which are comparatively expensive and require the involvement of legal persons like a corporation or human. Smart alternative contracts might enable an entirely new type of commerce carried out between our computers, cars, phones, and appliances.\n\nThere probably are – or will be – other types of commercial interaction that aren’t well suited to traditional legal contracts. New markets, suddenly made possible by technology, but which are underserved by legal tools that are slow to innovate and adapt.\n\nSmart alternative contracts might let us stretch the web of trust out a little further, a little faster, beyond the reach of the legal system, where they can enable new forms of commerce not possible today.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe lack of clear terminology in this field is an unfortunate reality. Those of us who work in the blockchain space should be mindful of how the term is being used in different communities, and be prepared to ask a series of annoying, though necessary, clarifying questions when asked about the nature and potential of “smart contracts”.\n\nThe different uses of the term illustrate a broader challenge in our industry. The interdisciplinary nature of blockchain technology, and “smart contracts” in particular, lead people to see the technology as primarily belonging to their own discipline, at the expense of the others.\n\nLawyers often look at smart contracts and see marginally improved legal agreements, without appreciating the fuller potential of blockchain-code to extend beyond law’s reach.\n\nDevelopers, on the other hand, consider smart contracts and see the limitless possibilities of software, without appreciating the subtleties and commercial realities reflected in traditional legal agreements.\n\nAs with any interdisciplinary field, both must learn from the other.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

But the Internet\'s nasty elements and incursions on your privacy don\'t take vacations.\n\nA megabreach of MySpace served as a reminder that even services you\'ve forgotten about may hold your private data and leave it vulnerable— and that was just one of a string of data dumps offered by a single shady dark web data dealer. Yahoo became the first company to reveal it had received National Security Letters without having to duke it out with the government in court. Facebook introduced a new method of showing ads across the web that calls for some tweaks to your privacy preferences. Google\'s Android security team are trainingintelligent computers to help in the fight against malware. Speaking of the fight against malware, we explained what ""fuzzing"" is and why it matters. We introduced you to a Romanian hacker who is using his skills for good, not evil. Security researchers showed that five of the most popular computer makers leave their machines open to malicious updates from hackers. And another team of researchers proved that it\'s possible to hide a hackable backdoor in a processor that consists of only one single, microscopic component out of a billion.\n\nBut—unfortunately—there was more: Each Saturday we round up the news stories that we didn’t break or cover in depth at WIRED, but which deserve your attention nonetheless. As always, click on the headlines to read the full story in each link posted. And stay safe out there.\n\nMyspace, it seems, was only this week\'s first reminder of the dangers of stale, insecure data. Collections of millions of stolen passwords from Tumblr—taken in a 2013 compromise of the site—and the dating site Fling also showed up in dark web data sales. In fact, the MySpace, Tumblr and Fling data was all offered for sale by the same data broker, someone going by the name peace_of_mind, who last week put up for sale the fruits of a giant, if outdated, breach from a 2012 hack of LinkedIn. In total, the collection of breached passwords for sale has now risen to 642 million—not a number the information security industry can be proud of. All of that should serve as a reminder of account security basics: User two-factor authentication whenever possible to protect your online accounts, choose strong passwords that can\'t easily be cracked if they\'re breached in a cryptographically ""hashed"" form, and don\'t reuse passwords between services.\n\nJust when the week of megabreaches seemed at an end, breach-monitoring service Leaked Source discovered an apparently hacked collection of as many as 127 million accounts, including hashed passwords, from the UK-based social networking service Badoo. Badoo, however, denies having been hacked, and the source of the megabreach remains unconfirmed for now.\n\nThe FBI is building a mega-collection of Americans’ biometric information, from DNA profiles to facial recognition data. And perhaps unsurprisingly for a project with such privacy invasive potential, the bureau wants to exempt that database from a key privacy regulation. In early May, the FBI filed a proposal to create an exemption in the Privacy Act for its so-called Next Generation Identification System, a collection it’s building of biometric data from more than 70 million criminal records and 38.5 civil ones, including state motor vehicles departments, visa applications and welfare screenings. That exemption would free the FBI from the Privacy Act’s requirement that federal agencies share the data collected about individuals with them and give them a legal right to determine its accuracy. A group of 45 civil society groups issued an open letter opposing the move, including the ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Amnesty International and even Lyft and Uber.\n\nWhen the drug market Sheep Marketplace went offline in 2013, it told people that it had been hacked by one of the site’s users and its entire cache of bitcoins stolen. The site’s users mostly assumed that Sheep’s own administrators must have run off with their coins instead, a so-called “exit scam.” But now a forfeiture agreement in a Florida criminal case reveals that two men, 24-year-olds Nathan Gibson and Sean Mackert, did in fact hack Sheep Marketplace and made off with 5,400 bitcoins worth close to $6.6 million at the time, which have now been seized by law enforcement. Mackert and Gibson allegedly made a rookie mistake that led Department of Homeland Security investigators to their doors: they apparently forgot that bitcoin is far from anonymous by default. By taking their stolen coins directly from Sheep to the bitcoin service Coinbase, the DHS investigators were able to track the heist in bitcoin’s public ledger known as the blockchain and subpoena Coinbase for their identities.\n\nIran’s theocratic government, like that of so many other repressive regimes, remains locked in a cat-and-mouse struggle with the country’s online population who seek to circumvent its draconian control of the Internet. Now the country has made a drastic move in that battle for digital control: It’s required all social media services with Iranian users to host their servers within the country’s borders. That stricture would make it far easier for Iran to censor and surveil services like Telegram, which is used by close to a quarter of all Iranians. The country is giving those services a year to comply. Those that don’t will no doubt end up on the country’s list of banned services, which already includes Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.\n\nThe bad news: Researchers have found a “several versions” of malware that closely resembles Stuxnet, the “digital weapon” that attacked an Iranian nuclear facility several years ago. The slightly better news? It only works within a simulated Siemens control system environment, and it’s been given a cool-sounding name: Irongate. Like Stuxnet, Irongate focuses on a single, specific control system process. And similarly to how Stuxnet avoided antivirus detection, Irongate can evade being spotted in sandbox environments. It doesn’t pose any kind of specific threat—the key word is “simulated”—but it’s at least a reminder that Stuxnet wasn’t a one-off, and defenses against something else like it still aren’t up to snuff.', 'Technological growth, quest for change, rapid evolution, pursuit of relevance and maturity, are among the many factors which have seen the Blockchain ecosystem experience a season of partnerships and collaboration within the past few months.\n\nVery often, crypto users awake to news of new partnerships and strategic promises. Is it a booming trend of 2016? And what’s behind it?\n\nVanbex partners with Shanghai Blockchain\n\nIn one of these developments, the professional services firm specializing in all aspects of the Blockchain industry, Vanbex has announced a strategic partnership with Shanghai Blockchain Network Technology Co. Ltd., parent company of one of China’s largest Bitcoin exchanges, 19800.com.\n\n19800.com, officially opened on 15th March 2016 and within one month it reached 20,000 registered users with an average daily trading volume of more than US $1.5 million.\n\nKevin Hobbs, Vanbex Group director, says:\n\n“With their lineup of online products, Blockchain-based products and services, 19800.com is already a highly active player in the market and we believe it’s only a short time before they are global leaders within the industry.”\n\nShanghai Blockchain (19800.com) will also be sponsoring the d10e Conference in July with the help of the Vanbex Group, providing virtual reality technology developed by Time Technologies (Canada), an affiliated partner of Shanghai Blockchain.\n\nThe quest for change and the pursuit of relevance\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph on the factors which could have been responsible for the prevailing trend in partnerships, Lead developer of Expanse and President of Borderless Charity, Inc. Christopher Franko says:\n\n“Ideally the partnerships that we see today are because people really want to change the world, and want to use the Blockchain to do it, because the Blockchain is great for lowering costs, liabilities, and enhancing trust.”\n\nHowever, Franko expresses fear that some companies may just be trying to be relevant/trendy and ""innovative"" by simply capturing buzzwords.\n\n“I’ve experienced the latter multiple times when consulting with clients. They want to be able to say ""we are a Blockchain company"" but don\'t really believe in the historical ethos of Blockchain tech, like being decentralized, open-source and disruptive.”\n\nFranko explains:\n\n“Now it feels like it is all about the money, all about selling tokens, all about ico\'s and less about being a positive force in society. There are some projects that still stick to the Blockchain chivalrous code, but our numbers are reducing drastically by the day. Some say money and power corrupt, but really it just reveals who people really are. That is what we are seeing come to fruition in the Blockchain ecosystem.”\n\nRapid growth and industrial maturity\n\nAnari Sengbe, Founder at ProducTank attributes this trend to rapid growth in technology.\n\nSengbe says:\n\n“I think a consolidation of talent could be the reason. I don\'t think there\'s ever been as rapid changes in technology as we\'ve seen in crypto. It\'s tough to think in two Blockchains, we\'ve spent years become experts in Bitcoin, now you have ether and teams need to understand both.”\n\nDavid Mondrus sums up his opinion towards this development in one simple phrase, saying:']"
06/05/2016,"['American Express (NYSE:AXP) has released a report written by financial columnist Frances Coppola called “Bitcoin and the Future of Blockchain in International Payments Systems” which discusses the implementations of the Bitcoin blockchain and its use cases within financial markets. The article gives detail into the processes involved with the cryptocurrency and also calls Ethereum a challenger within the new digital currency landscape.\n\nFrances Coppola is a regular writer for the Financial Times, Forbes and other publications. In this particular paper written for the multinational financial services corporation American Express (AMEX) she covers the very basics of Bitcoin technology, mining, anonymity, and as an international payments system. Coppola notes that the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin gained a lot of attention after the 2008 financial crisis. The author also mentions that people at the time used the currency for illegal activity with websites such as the Silk Road referring to it as the “criminals’ currency” during this time period. The author explains the initial beginnings of Bitcoin in the AMEX report stating:\n\n“In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin’s transparent peer-to-peer nature appealed to people weary of broken banks. Computer-literate people adopted Bitcoin as the symbol of the new technology that would save a failing financial system. Investors worried about inflationary consequences of the central banks’ quantitative easing valued its gold-like nature: since no more than 21 million bitcoins could ever be mined, there was no risk of value destruction through hyperinflation. And because Bitcoin is neither issued nor controlled by governments, it attracted those who did not trust government – or wished to avoid government attention.”\n\nNow Coppola explains the cryptocurrency is “becoming more respectable” and used for legitimate purposes. Unfortunately, the author mentions the defunct Mt Gox exchange as a place that has appeared for the purchasing and selling of Bitcoins but fails to mention the exchange has gone insolvent. She says as an international payments system the cryptocurrency has a “dilemma” and gives some example to the current scaling debate taking place within the community. The further the report goes into explaining Bitcoin the more obfuscated the article becomes and shows the research done must have been written hastily. This is especially apparent when the author discusses the scaling of the network section and stating Ethereum has anonymous capabilities which is not the case.\n\nThe report written for AMEX says banks are looking into the Ethereum protocol, and it may be a competitor to the Bitcoin currency. Coppola also explains that these cryptocurrencies have also “attracted the attention of regulators concerned about money laundering, tax evasion, and fraud.” She mentions that some countries have not established the cryptocurrency as money within particular regions of the world. Also Coppola notes there are a few countries that have banned Bitcoin outright such as Ecuador.\n\nCryptocurrency supporters and Bitcoin enthusiasts probably will agree Banks like American Express need better consultants when it comes to emerging digital currencies, Blockchain technology, and these protocols. Unfortunately, papers like this may not give a solid understanding of Bitcoin because it was reported on by someone with very little knowledge on the subject. As usual, the cryptocurrency itself is downplayed, and the author’s opinion is that “Blockchain technology is set to revolutionise international payments.”\n\nSource: AMEX\n\nImage: AMEX, and Pixabay', 'Steam, a platform that offers instant access to games globally, is no longer accepting bitcoin in Russia, according to customers in the country.\n\nThere was nothing about the change in policy for Russia on the company’s website at the time of this report.

For a year, the team of researchers worked on a project to verify digital credentials using the Bitcoin Blockchain and Mozilla Open Badges.\n\nThe MIT Researchers say the Bitcoin Blockchain is the ‘most tested and reliable blockchain to date.’\n\nThe team of researchers from MIT have released the code to this open source project to make it easier for people to build similar applications. The project was conceived because of the belief in the importance of immutable digital credentials. The paper details a previous post written by J. Philipp Schmidt proposing that the certificate concepts could replicate the days in the past when “journeymen carpenters carried around their books of stamps and references.” Throughout the paper, the authors say they have learned quite a bit about blockchain technology and even the “hype.” MIT Media Labs report recognizes there is a lot of attention aimed at distributed ledger technology but it’s not entirely simple. The MIT blog post written by Juliana Nazaré, J. Philipp Schmidt, and Kim Hamilton Duffy explains:\n\n“One important takeaway for us has been that the blockchain is a lot more complicated than most people make it out to be. Building applications on top of it–which is what we did–is getting easier, but there are still very few people who deeply understand its inner workings (and we don’t consider ourselves part of that group). The blockchain is not a simple solution that will fix everything that is wrong with today’s credentials. But it does offer some possibilities for improving the system we have today–and that’s what we are excited to explore.”\n\nLinks to the source code and discussions about the project can be seen here and the team says the certificate architecture is “fairly simple.” The digital certificates framework includes the following repositories Cert-schema, Cert-issuer, and Cert-viewer which work together to broadcast the data into the Bitcoin blockchain. The paper also mentions the Ethereum blockchain saying that when they started the programmable currency was in its infancy and the Bitcoin Blockchain is the “most tested and reliable blockchain to date.”\n\nThe researchers at MIT also use public/private key cryptography to authenticate issuers and recipients of the digital certification. The application also has a revoking feature to remove a certificate but it is not an actual deletion because the original information can never be deleted from the blockchain. The blog post notes the Bitcoin distributed ledger is open and immutable but the authors recognize people still have a concern for privacy. The report explains:\n\n“Some of our colleagues at MIT are working on systems that will provide more sophisticated ways of managing private data, but these are still in the early development stages. In our current solution, we try to balance obfuscation with usability so that institutions or learners that lack advanced technical sophistication will not be prevented from using the credentials. We do this by hashing the certificate and only placing the hash on the blockchain. If someone wants to verify the validity of a certificate, they need the learner to disclose both the certificate itself and where the hash of the certificate is located on the blockchain.”\n\nThe right to curation is an important measure to the authors for people who like to pick and choose what certificates they would like to be publicized. The group says it is entirely up to the curator on how much they would like to share about themselves. For instance with the MIT blockchain verified certification an educator may want to look at a student’s academic records. The teacher could try and search for the students employment certification but “the content of these certificates will be encrypted.” Although the researchers say there are “shortcomings” and they are trying to make traceability harder with future implementations.\n\nThe project is currently available for testing the application at the researcher’s new digital authentication MIT Media Lab web site. The creators of the projects say if people are experimenting with this type of technology they should join their GitHub repository. Overall the MIT researchers seem pleased with the work they accomplished and look forward to continuing the project. MIT has a strong influence when it comes to digital currency and blockchain solutions with backing from its very own Digital Currency Initiative. It’s good to see such innovation coming out of the Boston school as they seem to be embracing the subject head on.\n\nSource: MITMediaLab\n\nImages: MITMediaLab & NewsBTC', 'Bitcoin is emerging as a unique asset class, according to a recent report by Chris Burniske, blockchain analyst and products lead at Ark Invest, and Adam White, vice president of business development and strategy at Coinbase.\n\nIn their report, titled “Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New Asset Class,” the authors argue that bitcoin is investable but differs significantly from other assets in its politico-economic profile, price of independence, and risk-reward characteristics. They believe cryptocurrency’s open source software will differentiate it further from other asset classes. They believe it could grow to substantial market capitalization.\n\nAsset Class Characteristics\n\nAsset classes are viewed in different ways. Oftentimes they are seen in terms of investability. They also differ in their politico-economic features and their correlation of price movements and risk-reward profiles. Burniske and White explore bitcoin in the context of all four criteria.\n\nThe authors believe an asset class must be investable, providing opportunity to invest and ample liquidity. It should also have a politico-economic profile based on governance, value and use cases. In addition, its market value should fluctuate independently of other assets and exhibit a low correlation of returns.\n\nThe three characteristics noted above should provide a differentiated risk-reward profile that can be measured in volatility and returns, a fourth characteristic.\n\nBurniske and Adams, by analyzing bitcoin’s behavior based on these four criteria, attempt to determine its merit as a bellwether for cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin Versus Other Assets\n\nCryptocurrency as an asset class cannot be considered unique without observing its behavior in relation to traditional classes of assets: bonds, real estate, equities, energy products, precious metals and fiat currencies.\n\nIn examining bitcoin’s investability, bitcoin’s average daily liquidity in a three-month period nearly matched the SPDR Gold Shares ETF and was three times that of the Vanguard REIT ETF.\n\n“In our opinion, equal or superior volume with a fraction of the assets under management underscores that bitcoin is punching significantly above its weight,” the authors noted.\n\nInvestability To Improve\n\nThe authors believe it is likely that as cryptocurrencies mature, bitcoin holders will expand and provide a positive tailwind for investability.\n\nCharacteristics of bitcoin’s investability include its censorship resistance and its permissionless and distributed blockchain. As the network’s infrastructure grows, bitcoin could become the most accessible and secure asset available to the public.\n\nWhile bitcoin is not widely held or the most liquid asset, the authors believe its fringe status is overstated. An institutional infrastructure is emerging for bitcoin with products such as TeraExchange Bitcoin forwards, exchange-traded funds, the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust, and XBT Provider’s exchange traded notes on Nasdaq Nordic in Stockholm.\n\nPolitico-Economic Profile\n\nThe politico-economic profile for an asset is driven mainly by its governance, basis of value and use cases. Bitcoin is distinct from major asset classes.\n\nBitcoin’s basis of value is unique, but its governance is more of an anomaly. Its transactions are verified through an open and decentralized network of computers called miners.\n\nBitcoin supply is mathematically metered by its software and will converge on a fixed 21 million units in 2140. Its supply characteristics contrast with fiat currencies, which are governed by monetary policies that often lead to supply shocks.\n\nNo asset has evolved from concept to billions of dollars in stored value as fast as bitcoin. Nor has any asset followed such a predictable supply trajectory.\n\nIn comparing bitcoin’s trading volume to its transactional volume, bitcoin’s use as an investment medium is expanding faster than its transactional applications.\n\nTransaction/Trading Balance\n\nWhile some are alarmed by bitcoin’s use as a speculative instrument compared to fiat currencies, bitcoin strikes a close balance between transacting and trading.\n\nWhen people use bitcoin, they are more likely to use it to transmit value for goods and services than as a speculative investment. Coinbase and ARK view bitcoin’s increased trading volume as a healthy sign for decreasing volatility, further catalyzing transactional volume.\n\nBitcoin trading in the more regulated currencies has been rising at the same rate as its transactional volumes.\n\nThe authors noted that bitcoin’s price movements have been distinct from other asset classes in the last five years. Bitcoin is the only asset that maintains low correlations consistently with every other asset: gold, S&P 500, U.S. bonds, U.S. real estate, oil and emerging markets.\n\nRisk-Reward Profiles\n\nIn examining risk-reward profiles, the authors noted bitcoin’s volatility has declined. At the start of May 2016, bitcoin’s daily volatility was about a third of that of five years ago and 24% less than early May 2015. The volatility decline is due to stable and liquid spot exchanges, more regulatory approval, broader ownership and more reliable price discovery data.\n\nAbsolute Returns\n\nIn examining absolute returns, the authors noted bitcoin has provided investors returns beyond that of any other asset class. They recounted the history of bitcoin’s price changes.\n\nThey noted that neither absolute return nor volatility is a sufficient indicator of good investment. An investor must adjust absolute returns for the level of risk.\n\nAlso read: Is BTC a safe asset?\n\nA Unique Asset Class\n\nBitcoin demonstrates characteristics of a unique asset class. It meets the bar of investability, and it differs significantly from other assets in price independence, politico-economic profile, and risk-reward characteristics.\n\nAs the analysis encompasses five years, the authors noted it will be important to monitor bitcoin’s behavior in relation to the broader markets.\n\nAs the asset’s open source software evolves, bitcoin will distinguish itself further from other asset classes. Innovations like segregated witness can catalyze bitcoin’s more innovative uses cases. Sidechains and smart contracts could allow new financial services such as liquid private markets and peer-to-peer loan issuance.\n\nCoinbase and Ark view bitcoin as the first in a new type of asset class. Because cryptocurrencies are subject to network effects of developers and users, they could submit to a “winner takes most” model, unlike equities and bonds. The cryptocurrencies that foster the flywheel of developer and user engagement can expand to formidable market capitalizations.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As the risk of having your password leaked is rather high nowadays and millions of reported cases are not resolved yet, every Bitcoin and other digital currency users should remember to improve his or her account’s security.\n\nCoinTelegraph has looked into the best of ways to secure your Bitcoin Wallet and made a list of tips to follow.\n\nRecent setbacks\n\nLast month, CoinWallet.co announced the closure of its platform primarily because it suffered a data breach on the 6th of April.\n\nIt says:\n\n“This incident prompted us to reassess the viability of running coinwallet.co and it was decided it is just not viable taking into consideration the risk, costs and time involved.”\n\nThe same hacker who was selling the data of more than 164 million LinkedIn users later claimed he had 360 million emails and passwords of MySpace users, which would make it one of the largest leaks of passwords ever.

However, it is still a good while off its historical highest point of 13.8 billion dollars of November 2013.\n\n9 billion dollar market capitalization\n\nOn Saturday, June 4th 2016, Bitcoin surpassed the 9 billion dollar market capitalization mark for the first time since February 2014.\n\nAlthough this was only a temporary change, it is testament to the rising acceptance of the cryptocurrency and its associated rising price.\n\nHowever, as Reddit user, /u/chuckymcgee, pointed out in a Reddit thread discussing the 9 billion dollar market capitalization, “the true market cap is actually smaller than $9 billion because of millions of lost coins. Bitcoin\'s a baby and has much more room to grow than even a relatively small ""$9 billion"" cap would suggest.”\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin’s market capitalization sits at $8,877,114,177.\n\nMarket capitalization milestones\n\nAt its highest point, Bitcoin’s market capitalization stood at around 13.8 billion dollars, in November 2013.\n\nHowever, following the closure of the biggest Bitcoin exchange at the time, Mt Gox, the price plummeted to an all-time low of 2.8 billion dollars, a milestone from which it is still recovering. The year of 2015 was not kind to the cryptocurrency as the price stalled and even decreased, but 2016 is proving to be quite the savior, with the current surge only serving to cement this viewpoint.', ""On Saturday afternoon, a massive DDoS attack hit BitGo, a service that describes itself as the most secure Bitcoin wallet solution available today.\n\nThe attack lasted between four and five hours and brought down the company's servers completely. BitGo didn't react to the incident until an hour later, tweeting out apologies to its clients.\n\nUsually, Bitcoin users have to wait hours before a Bitcoin transaction is approved. Over the past few years, BitGo has built a ground-breaking and extremely secure platform for powering near-instant Bitcoin transactions.\n\nBitGo DDoS takes down several other services\n\nBecause of its unique offering, the service has gathered quite a following in the Bitcoin world, either through its own wallet service or via its API, integrated with companies such as Wirex, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Unocoin, and Kraken.\n\nThese services integrate BitGo in order to provide immediate Bitcoin transactions without requiring users to wait hours for the operation to go through.\n\nAs soon as the DDoS hit, many of these companies faced issues as well, not being able to provide immediate resolutions for some of their transactions.\n\nRecently, Wirex has integrated BitGo as the go-to solution to power its Bitcoin-based debit cards. The DDoS attack on BitGo brought down its service, and the company sent out an email message to all of its customers telling them to avoid making transactions until they received confirmation from BitGo that its service resumed.\n\nDDoS attacks on Bitcoin sites are a lucrative business\n\nDDoS attacks on Bitcoin portals is nothing new. Some hackers make a living just from renting their services on the Dark Web and then launching on-demand DDoS attacks on Bitcoin payment portals.\n\nBesides DDoS attacks, Bitcoin services have been at the heart of numerous security-related incidents that have often ended in Bitcoin theft. Some of the services that have recently seen data breaches include Gatecoin, Shapeshift, CoinWallet, BitQuick, Cryptsy, and LoanBase.\n\nBitGo customers - We apologize for the issue, but we're under DDOS attack at this moment. We're working on it and will keep you updated. — BitGo (@BitGo) June 4, 2016"", 'It’s no secret that, in an effort to ease the concerns of global regulators and secure lucrative partnerships in the IT and banking sectors, the “bitcoin industry” has over the last year been on a steady campaign to rebrand as the “blockchain” or “digital asset” industry.\n\nBut as much as the bitcoin industry would like to distance itself from associations with drugs and crime, the technology still remains both popular with, and popularly associated with, those involved with such activities.\n\nIn process of writing a forthcoming book, I embarked on a 48-state research effort last summer to learn more about money and finance. Far from the headlines, I would meet only a handful of people that used bitcoin.\n\nAnd nearly every time it was for drug sales, both legal and illegal.\n\nIn South Carolina, a man who camps out during the week behind a hostel struck up a conversation, drawn by the bitcoin decal on my car window. Sure enough, Dave, a married man in his 30s, didn’t learn about bitcoin in The Wall Street Journal. Dave sells Kratom, a tropical Southeast Asian plant known for its opiate-like effects for pain and anxiety relief, online in exchange for bitcoin.\n\nSimilar to the emergence of salvia in the US nearly a decade ago, the psychoactive plant has been banned in several countries, and in the US many states have legislative proposals to ban the substance in various forms of development.\n\n(Kratom is currently legal in 45 states, excluding Indiana, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Alabama and Vermont, and legislation is pending in other states after several government agencies issued alerts and guidance.)\n\nIn South Carolina, Kratom, while a gray area, remains legal. But, the example shows that bitcoin’s most impactful use cases today are operating in the gap between what’s legal and what’s frowned upon by regulators.\n\nBitcoin seems just as popular as a payment method for marijuana purchases in Colorado. According to an associate at a dispensary in Colorado Springs, a city that only allows medical marijuana sales, one customer comes in weekly and purchases marijuana using bitcoin.\n\nAnother sales associate was unclear what merchant processor the dispensary uses to accept the bitcoin payments, but she said that there’s a $10,000 limit for bitcoin transactions per month.\n\nNotably, she said the customer routinely spends this amount in a given week.\n\nBitcoin ATMs\n\nAs cryptocurrency becomes more popular, online bitcoin brokerages and exchanges have certainly gotten more stringent as it relates to regulatory compliance. While it used to be possible to purchase bitcoin while providing few personal details, a know-your-customer (KYC) check has become an industry standard for these companies.\n\nBut bitcoin is still an open platform, and the protocol makes no distinction between users. On the bitcoin blockchain, an address is an address, regardless of who owns it and how they intend to use any bitcoins they might possess.\n\nBitcoin ATMs, which operate like traditional cash dispensers, may play a role in keeping bitcoin the quick and accessible payment method as it was originally touted.\n\nAt one bar and restaurant in the US, owners told a story about how a customer knocked on the door of the establishment after hours asking servers to use the bitcoin ATM. When the servers said that the ATM shuts down when the restaurant does, the customer told them he’d give them $100 if he could still use the machine.\n\nThe situation highlights one of the reasonable grounds to suspect a money laundering or terrorist financing offense, according to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). Offenses like these are a red flag and must be reported.\n\nStories like this seem more commonplace than acknowledged.\n\nIn Atlanta last year, a Lamassu Bitcoin ATM was stolen by two culprits brandishing a handgun from a smoke shop. While it’s unclear how much the robbers knew about bitcoin, there was speculation that they thought bitcoin could be extracted from the machine or that large sums of cash were inside, which is not always the case.\n\nWhatever they were looking to achieve, it’s safe to say that they most likely weren’t looking to purchase bitcoin to investigate how it could cut costs in the back-end of their business.\n\nImproving the system\n\nBitcoin ATMs were seen as transformative for consumer acquisition of bitcoin when the devices first appeared on the market, but they’ve become less fashionable over the past year because of complicated user experiences and compounding regulatory pressure.\n\nLike most parts of the bitcoin economy’s infrastructure, bitcoin ATMs are evolving, and operators in the industry are looking to identify and correct these issues, while still enabling buyers to access bitcoin conveniently.\n\nAaron Williams, founder of Coinnections, is one entrepreneur who is seeking solutions to ease the KYC requirements bitcoin ATM owners would need to implement. Currently developming the beta for an anti-money laundering software product for cryptocurrency businesses, Coinnections’ creator believes US consumers will prefer bitcoin ATMs over bitcoin exchanges in the future.\n\n“Bitcoin ATM operators benefit from their small size in that they can implement a true risk-based AML program,” Williams has said. “A true risk-based AML program can allow for lower identification thresholds while still allowing the user to buy a useful amount of bitcoin. ATM operators can also benefit from not having to comply with multiple regulatory regions.”\n\nThough it might seem that the use of these machines has slowed, several Bitcoin ATM operators who wanted to remain anonymous said they’re still pulling in large amounts of cash from underbanked minorities.\n\nGil Luria, an analyst focusing on bitcoin and blockchain at Wedbush Securities, believes that bitcoin ATMs may play a key role in other less controversial gray areas of the financial system, such as helping the underbanked and migrant workers.\n\n“The main use case for a bitcoin ATM is a consumer that wants another level of anonymity since linking bitcoin wallets to a bank account or credit card defeats the purpose. Funding a bitcoin wallet with cash may be helping these consumers maintain their privacy,” he said.\n\nHow the bitcoin ecosystem will develop along this fine line remains an ongoing narrative in the industry, though it’s one that, for now, might not have the benefit of venture capital or big bank investment.\n\nOut of this association with crime has come the “blockchain without bitcoin” movement that has found regulated, risk-averse financial institutions and enterprises opting to build their own blockchain protocol without the bitcoin currency riding on top.\n\nBut whether or not bitcoin is used for the gray areas of commerce, it still stands as the only blockchain project that is currently in the wild and innovating on the clunky traditional payments process.\n\nBailey Reutzel is a veteran finance reporter, most recently covering the intersection of tech and finance for PaymentsSource.\n\nHer latest project Moneytripping is a Gonzo-style journalism project focused on exploring money, politics and finance in America.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The US central bank has had over 50 cyber security breaches in a span of 5 years. Read more...\n\nThere have been concerns about the security vulnerabilities faced by Bitcoin exchanges and how people may end up losing money by investing in digital currencies. The governments and central banks across the world have also issued circulars en masse couple of years ago declaring Bitcoin and other digital currencies as high-risk investments and also warning people about various security risks. Also, attacks on Bitcoin exchanges and wallet services have received widespread media coverage in the past.\n\nWhile the governments and banks continue to convince people that fiat currency and banking institutions are the most reliable and secure components of the monetary system, the recent report based on information obtained through the Freedom of Information Act has revealed that the cyber security of US Federal Reserve doesn’t even come close to that of many Bitcoin exchanges operating today. The report has revealed that the Federal Reserve has faced over 50 security breaches during a span of 5 years.\n\nWhile there is no information about whether the hackers were behind money or financial information, these hacks between 2011 to 2015 have uncovered a chink in the armor of what is supposed to be one of the most secure entities. The information reported by Reuters has got the US Congressional Committee launching an investigation into the serious lapse of security.\n\n“These reports raise serious concerns about the Federal Reserve’s cyber security posture, including its ability to prevent threats from compromising highly sensitive financial information housed on the agency’s systems,”\n\n– states a letter from the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.\n\nUnlike digital currency exchanges, the banking system holds lots of confidential financial as well as personal information. Any security breach is most likely to compromise much more than money in these cases. While most of the incidents involving cyber-attacks on Federal Reserve or any other banking institution for that matter go unreported, the recent theft of over $81 million belonging to the Central Bank of Bangladesh from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York made it to the news.\n\nThe banking system has been heavily dependent on legacy systems and SWIFT network for a long time. A flaw in the SWIFT has been detected and according to its CEO, it may take years for them to upgrade their cyber defenses. Which means, the users have to put up with the risk of losing money for a couple of more years.\n\nBitcoin platforms, more secure than the Federal Reserve and other banks\n\nThe conventional banking system has also failed to keep up with evolving security standards as well. According to recent reports, many ATMs connected to the banking network are still running on outdated Windows XP operating systems. All these things when considered makes one think of Bitcoin to be the most secure option available out there at the moment.\n\nWith Bitcoin, at least one doesn’t incur more debts while losing personal information due to credit card frauds, or just have the bank lose your money. Even though online bitcoin wallets and exchange services are not completely fool-proof at least one has the option to distribute their digital currency holdings across different wallets or store it on their computer or even better, create paper wallets. One can easily store 100 bitcoins on a single piece of paper but keeping an equivalent value in bank notes is much difficult.\n\nAs for the Federal Reserve incident, complete details about the security breaches may be made public in the coming days as the Congressional Committee has asked for unredacted reports on the security issued to be made available for review and inquiry.', 'Bitcoin was created with an intention of saving people’s lives from being ruined by the centralized monetary system and flawed policies framed by governments and central banks. When Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper on Bitcoin, no one imagined that it may literally save lives in the long run.\n\nAs developers continue to unearth new applications of Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology, one of the major breakthroughs of its application is in the field of drug development and testing process. Drug development is a costly and time-consuming process. Even though the in silico protein and drug modelling processes have considerably reduced the time taken for the development of a new drug, it still takes years, if not decades to launch a new drug into the market. In order to launch the drug, it has to first pass stringent trials on both lab rats and humans. Only upon review of these trials will the concerned regulatory body, like the FDA approve it for sales.\n\nEven though a drug may do its job very well in curing the disease it is designed to treat, it may also present some really nasty side effects resulting in other serious health issues, which may even prove fatal. The clinical trials are conducted to monitor not just the effectiveness of the drug but also to check for any side effects and weigh the pros and cons of both. However, the pharmaceutical companies and scientists working on these drugs may selectively share only the positive effects of the said drug while conveniently ignoring any side effects, like in the case of an anti-depressant Paroxetine which was reported to be effective in treating patients with depression. However, it turned out to be not so effective in the later studies. Instead of addressing the issue, Paroxetine was found to increase suicidal behavior.\n\nRecording clinical trial protocols on the blockchain\n\nIn order to prevent the pharma companies and researchers from fudging the data, a researcher and doctor at the University of Cambridge, Greg Irving has created a blockchain based system to record and independently verify the clinical trial protocols as specified by those conducting the study. The immutability of Bitcoin blockchain has been put to use by Greg Irving and his study has been published in F1000 Research along with co-author John Holden.\n\nThe whole purpose of this proof of concept created by Greg Irving is to ensure that the pharma companies or researchers are not deviating from the actual trial by making modifications to the actual trial protocol after conducting a clinical trial to match with its outcome. As a part of the proof of concept, Greg Irving has used an entry of a study protocol from the ClinicalTrials.gov site. He has created an unformatted text file containing the pre-specified endpoints and planned analysis as described by the uploader. The data from the unformatted text file is then converted into an SHA-256 digest using Xorbin SHA-256 hash calculator. The resulting SHA-256 hash was then used as a private key for a Strongcoin Bitcoin wallet, followed by the creation of a public key to enable transactions. This was followed by an arbitrary bitcoin transaction form a second wallet to the one with the newly generated SHA-256 hash as a private key. This transaction recorded the public key on the blockchain, making it easily verifiable over the blockchain.\n\nNow, anyone with the unformatted text containing clinical trial protocol can follow the same steps to generate a public key, corresponding to the one that was initially generated and verified over the blockchain by making an arbitrary transaction. If the public key in both the cases matches, then it not only proves the existence of the document with a time stamp but also verifies that the document has not been changed in any way. In case of any changes, the SHA-256 hash created will be different from the original one, resulting in a different public key.\n\nGreg Irving describes the whole process to be cost effective, as the bitcoin used to confirm the document’s existence can be retrieved from the wallet while maintaining the integrity of clinical trial protocols. While Greg Irving took a manual approach to create the proof of concept, the same thing can be automated and made publicly available. Any changes made to the protocol can be recorded as a separate entry, with a corresponding private and public key of its own, and can be verified in a similar fashion.\n\nGreg Irving and John Holden’s work is in line with the Helsinki declaration that requires all clinical trials to be recorded and published on a publicly accessible database while preventing data manipulation practices like outcome switching, dredging and selective publication that undermines the integrity of published research.\n\nRead full paper on F1000 Research.']"

This sideway movement is a rebound towards the upward trend, after which there will be a chance for the price to reach the $640 mark.\n\nAn exit from the flat can provoke an impulse\n\nThe advantage remains with the bulls. That is indicated by the behavior of the price at key levels. Upward rebounds at the level of $563.7 show that there is enough support for a future trend. If that short-term flat is a part of a larger movement, the following growth dynamic is quite likely to reach $640, the next long-term resistance line.\n\nBut the situation could change. If Bitcoin is going to be traded for a long time near $563.7, it could influence the majority of the traders, and the bears will take the advantage. In that case, there will be a deeper downward correction. The level of the flat and the diagonal channel serve as support lines for the upward trend. If a turn to decline doesn’t form at that point, the structure of the movement toward $640 will remain intact.\n\nThe structure of the upward trend could be disrupted at the $563.7 resistance line.', 'The Decentralized Autonomous Organization is a venture capital firm, like Andreessen Horowitz or Kleiner Perkins. It chooses new ideas and businesses to invest in. But the DAO isn\'t run by rich white Silicon Valley dudes. It\'s run by a network of machines that operate according to the same basic principles that drive the bitcoin digital currency. If you put money into the DAO, these machines let you vote on which new ideas it should invest in. The more money you put in, the more votes you get.\n\nBy the time the deadline for investing in the DAO arrived late last month, about 10,000 people had anonymously poured more than $168 million into this new online creation. That makes it the largest crowdfunded project ever. Now, it\'s time for the DAO to start accepting pitches for all those anonymous people to vote on, bringing a new kind of democracy to the iconic flavor of capitalism that delivers so much modern technology.\n\nJust one problem: So far, all the pitches are suggestions for changing the DAO.\n\nA few hours before the investing deadline, a group of computer scientists described what they believe are fundamental flaws in the DAO, both security holes and flaws that discourage participants from voting honestly. The group called for a moratorium on pitches, and now, the DAO is effectively on hold as the community decides whether these flaws exist and how to fix them.\n\nFor sure, even some of the DAO\'s biggest critics say it\'s a wonderful idea—a way of eliminating the kind of good ol\' boy network that often drives not only VC firms but so many other kinds of corporations. But like so many projects that have sprung from the ingenious, decentralized creation that is bitcoin, the DAO is still very much a work in progress, a technology run by an insular community that\'s still a long way from changing the world. ""The DAO represents a promise and a dream,"" says Emin Gün Sirer, a Cornell researcher in self-organizing systems like cryptocurrencies and the ""smart contracts"" that underpin the DAO. He\'s also a co-author of the paper that laid out the flaws. ""The question is: Will it be up to snuff? Will it uphold that dream?""\n\nTrying to build companies in an entirely new way doesn\'t come without risk. But no one expected the DAO to raise $168 million. That\'s risk on an enormous scale. ""This was very sloppily done and hastily done,"" says Patrick Murck, a lawyer and fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. ""That\'s unfortunate, because there is definitely something to the idea.""\n\nAnatomy of The DAO\n\nYes, this is an insular community. The DAO is based on Ethereum, an online system billed as an improved version of bitcoin, and many of the prominent figures in the Ethereum community are also working on the DAO, including some of the ""curators"" who decide which pitches get sent to the community. What\'s more, the project was created by European company, Slock.it, that hopes to use it to fund a separate project involving Ethereum and ""the Internet of Things."" When the first real pitch comes in on the DAO, it will be from Slock.it.\n\nBut first, the community has to fix it. Sirer says the DAO\'s biggest problem is that it doesn\'t encourage honest voting on new pitches. When a pitch comes in—asking for a certain amount of funds for a particular project and promising a certain return for each community member—anyone in the community can vote yes or no, or abstain. If you\'ve invested more money, your votes carry more weight. The trouble, Sirer and his co-authors argue, is that voting on a project also freezes funds you\'ve put into the DAO—even if you vote no. You can\'t withdraw funds while a vote is in progress, and if voters approve a project, that\'s where your funds go, regardless of how you voted. So if you don\'t believe in a project, you\'re better off abstaining than voting no.\n\nIn theory, software developers could build any kind company in this decentralized way.\n\nAs a result, all projects are more likely to gain approval—people just won\'t have the incentive to vote no. ""It\'s biased toward funding,"" Sirer says. ""That makes the DAO a very dangerous vehicle.""\n\nNow Vlad Zamfir, one of Sirer\'s co-authors and a prominent member of the Ethereum community, is helping pump the brakes on the DAO. Zamfir is one of the system\'s curators, chosen by Slock.it engineers to ""whitelist"" pitches before they go before the broader community. Zamfir is calling on all curators to refrain from whitelisting until the DAO\'s makers solve any fundamental flaws. But fixing the DAO would have to be every bit as democratic as investing with it. And democracy is messy.\n\nDemocratic Disarray\n\nLike bitcoin, the DAO is open source. The code runs across a network of independent machines, and anyone can change the code, provided the community agrees to the changes. A majority of the DAO\'s ""voting power"" must vote to approve a particular change, with voting power determined by how much money a voter has invested. That is part of the power of the system. ""I appreciate so many people looking at this—because so much money was raised,"" says Christoph Jentzsch, the CEO of Slock.it and one of the original authors of the code.\n\nAbout half of the $168 million came from about 70 addresses.\n\nBut that kind of collectivism can also be a real hindrance. The bitcoin project itself has experienced enormous tumult—with one prominent community member calling it ""a failure""—because contributors to the code couldn\'t agree on the project\'s direction.\n\nJentzsch says that changes to the DAO could happen fairly quickly—that the community just needs to agree on what should happen. But Sirer believes months or even years could go by. Predicting the outcome is difficult, since no one really knows who has poured so much money into the DAO or what their motivations are. Investments arrived from about 22,500 different Internet addresses, but the same people could be using multiple address. Jentzsch guesses about 10,000 individual investors in all have contributed to the project. A few individuals seem to have an especially great interest in the project: About half of the $168 million came from around 70 addresses.\n\nThe DAO\'s Insecurities\n\nBut even if the DAO overcomes flaws in its structure and code, it still has other problems. Like, it might be illegal. Murck, the Harvard lawyer, says that the DAO is trading in securities and that it hasn\'t received proper approval from regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Administration. ""There is clearly a concern when it comes to securities law,"" he says. ""I don\'t think the SEC would have trouble attaching liability to someone involved."" That liability might not be limited to Jentzsch and the other creators of the DAO, but also extend to curators and even investors.\n\nThat doesn\'t bother Jentzsch. While acknowledging that he\'s not a lawyer, he argues that shares in the DAO are not securities. And it doesn\'t bother Paolo Anziano, who has invested the equivalent of $7,000 in the project. ""This is technology that will change the shape of the financial process,"" he says.\n\nBut like the other apparent flaws in the DAO, legal uncertainty could keep this big idea from spreading. Like a lot of other self-organizing systems, the DAO just isn\'t that well-organized. At least, not yet.\n\nCorrection: This story orginally said that DAO token holders could not simultaneously vote on multiple projecys. They can.', 'BUSINESS\n\nA word of warning to Bitcoin portals: No one is safe.\n\nSeveral media outlets reported that BitGo, a bitcoin wallet service, was hit by a “massive” distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack last Saturday. The attack, which lasted between four to five hours, caused the company’s servers to completely crash, according to Softpedia.\n\nThe bitcoin wallet addressed the attack—an hour after it happened—by tweeting out: “We apologize for the issue, but we’re under DDOS attack at this moment. We’re working on it and will keep you updated.”\n\nBitGo claimed to be “the most secure” bitcoin wallet solution in the market today. Bitcoin users normally have to wait several hours before their digital currency transaction is approved, but BitGo said it has developed a “ground-breaking and extremely secure platform” that allows “near instant Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe wallet service, thanks to its unique offering, has gathered a following in the cryptocurrency sector, with companies such as Wirex, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Unocoin, and Kraken making use of the BitGo platform. So it doesn’t come as a surprise that the weekend DDOS attack has caused a ripple effect in many of these companies.\n\nWirex, a bitcoin debit card company, has already sent out emails to warn its users to hold off on any digital currency transaction until the company receives a confirmation that the issue has been dealt with.\n\nWhile unwelcome, DDOS attacks on Bitcoin portals is nothing new. The virtual currency space already has a bad rap following the infamous Mt. Gox case, which filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after claiming it had lost $450 million worth of bitcoins to hackers.\n\nLast May, Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Gatecoin was forced to shut down its service and ports after discovering a “potential leak” on its hot wallets. The company lost as much as 185,000 ethers and 250 bitcoins, worth an estimated $2.14 million.\n\nThe price of bitcoin already breached the $580 mark on Monday morning, hitting a high $585.99 with 173.57 million bitcoins in circulation.\n\nComments', ""Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain, and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin, and for what.\n\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors – to name some examples.\n\nAdditionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted,” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.\n\nBut there are potential solutions to increase privacy, and improve fungibility.\n\nA solution that has been around for a while is CoinJoin.\n\nBackground\n\nAt its heart, the Bitcoin protocol consists of transactions. All these transactions are completely public on the blockchain, which means that anyone can see which addresses sent bitcoins to which addresses. If some of these addresses are linked to real world identities, it can reveal who transacted with whom ? or what for. This is at odds with privacy and – in particular ? fungibility.\n\nAdditionally, each particular transaction spends one or several “inputs,” referring to the addresses bitcoins are sent from. (These inputs are spent to “outputs,” referring to the addresses bitcoins are sent to.) This poses another challenge to privacy and fungibility, since all input-addresses would typically belong to the same user: the sender of the transaction. If even one of all clustered input-addresses can be linked to a real-world identity, all of them are.\n\nCoinJoin – proposed in 2013 by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Gregory Maxwell – is designed to solve both these problems. It obfuscates the trail of bitcoins and breaks the assumption that all input-addresses belong to the same user.\n\nThe Idea\n\nThe CoinJoin concept is fairly straightforward.\n\nEssentially, CoinJoin lets multiple users combine all inputs and outputs from several transactions into a single, big transaction. This single transaction spends bitcoins from different addresses to different addresses – and since none of the sending addresses pay none of the receiving addresses specifically; there's no link between any of them.\n\n(This can be compared to a group of people who throw their cash together and go shopping. While everyone could make sure no one spends more than they should, the shoppers wouldn't necessarily spend the exact bills they originally put into the shared wallet themselves.)\n\nIn Bitcoin, this can be accomplished perfectly securely. All inputs require a corresponding signature from their respective owner, while the content of a transaction cannot be changed after a signature is added. As such, participants of a CoinJoin transaction simply announce which inputs and outputs they want to include in the transaction, and sign the aggregate only if these inputs and outputs are correctly included. Once all participants have signed (and only once they have signed), the transaction is broadcast.\n\nA key feature of CoinJoin: once the transaction is broadcast and included on the blockchain, there is no way of knowing which bitcoins went where; not even the recipients of the transaction will know from which addresses they got paid.\n\nAdditionally, CoinJoin improves privacy even of those who don't use it at all. Since a combination of inputs no longer necessarily means that all of the input-addresses belong to the same user, clustering has become a less powerful analytics tool in general.\n\nIn Practice\n\nCoinJoin does not require any changes to the Bitcoin protocol, and there are several implementations of it already. The main difference between some of the versions out there is how the CoinJoin transaction is created.\n\nThe easiest way to create a CoinJoin transaction is through a dedicated server. Anyone who wants to use CoinJoin would simply connect to the server to indicate which inputs and outputs the transaction should include. The server then creates a big aggregate transaction, and sends this back for all participants to sign. DarkWallet – the privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet that seems stuck in its alpha phase – employs a server-based model, as does the popular Blockchain web wallet, though its effectiveness has been questioned in the past.\n\nThe main problem with the server-based model, is that whoever controls the server would typically have access to the data provided by the individual participants. As such, this server presents a single point of failure from a privacy and fungibility perspective. There are potential solutions to cryptographically mask transaction data even from the server, but this is still theoretical for now.\n\nThere are also decentralized CoinJoin solutions, that construct CoinJoin-transactions peer-to-peer, or at least without any particular central intermediary. There have been several attempts in this direction, including Coinmux, Coinjumble, CoinJoiner and former DarkWallet developer Amir Taaki's CoinJoin tool. But none of these are widely used, and therefore not very useful – “coinjoining” makes sense only when there's someone to join with.\n\nA more recent take on the CoinJoin strategy that intends to tackle this problem is JoinMarket: a marketplace for CoinJoin transactions. Users can offer a spot in a CoinJoin transaction in return for a small fee – or buy access to a CoinJoin transaction themselves. The creators of JoinMarket believe that the incentive to mix coins in return for fees should generate enough liquidity to make the market a success – while the competitive nature of it should keep fees low. Indeed, JoinMarket is relatively well used compared to alternatives, and the order book (at the time of writing) offers thousands of bitcoins to mix with.\n\nLastly, another privacy-focused wallet, Samourai Wallet, currently includes a type of CoinJoin imitation, designed to throw off whoever is analyzing blockchain data. This option makes transactions appear like CoinJoin-transactions, while in reality all inputs and outputs belong to the same user. (Samourai Wallet plans to expand build-in and cross-wallet mixing options later this year, which might also utilize CoinJoin functionality.)\n\nDownsides and Trade-Offs\n\nWhile CoinJoin can be useful – it's not perfect.\n\nMost important, while CoinJoin does a great job at mixing inputs and outputs, this is not sufficient if the amounts are revealing. If one input sends 4.9 bitcoins, another input sends 2.7 bitcoins and a third inputs sends 0.8 bitcoins, while one output receives 4.9 bitcoins, one receives 2.7 bitcoins and a third receives 0.8 bitcoins, then it's simple to connect inputs to outputs.\n\nA potential solution to this problem, of course, are Confidential Transactions. Since Confidential Transactions mask the amounts sent (but not the inputs and outputs), CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions are a potentially powerful combination.\n\nAnother risk is that of Sybil attacks. Seemingly multiple participants in a CoinJoin transaction can really be one and the same entity, monitoring a particular participant.\n\n(If nine-of-ten inputs and outputs belong to a single NSA-agent sending bitcoins to himself, he would know which remaining output sent bitcoins to which remaining output.)\n\nThere is no easy solution for the problem of Sybil attacks, but as more genuine users mix their coins, it does become significantly harder to pull off successfully.\n\nWhich brings us to the next point: CoinJoin is still a hassle. Almost no wallets have it built in, and those that do aren't used a lot (and rely on a central server.) JoinMarket is probably the most successful implementation to date, but still requires special software and additional fees (though small).\n\nBut an interesting development on the horizon might skew these incentives: Schnorr signatures. Enabled by Segregated Witness, Schnorr signatures could allow for the aggregation of all signatures in a CoinJoin transaction into a single signature. This efficiency should result into lower transaction fees per input, and perhaps stimulate use of the most private and fungibility-friendly solution.\n\nThanks to Gregory Maxwell for added feedback."", 'A class action lawsuit filed against troubled bitcoin startup KnCMiner is proceeding despite a recent legal setback and a bankruptcy filing by the firm.\n\nAccording to emails provided to CoinDesk, lawyers representing the most prominent of several class action lawsuits filed against KnC have entered a claim against its bankruptcy estate in Sweden. Further, they indicated the group has provided information to local law enforcement in an attempt to ensure the firm can provide customer reparations.\n\nAn email to class action participants reads:\n\n""We have handed over all claims with the verifications to the criminal authorities for them to initiate the process of freezing KnC assets to cover your claim.""\n\nThe legal move comes amid what appear to be continued efforts by claimants after a verdict was rendered that KnC customers were businesses, not consumers, a finding that prohibited class action participants from obtaining consumer protections and reimbursement.\n\nAt the time of KnCMiner’s filing, management claimed that it would no longer be able to compete in the race for bitcoin rewards following an upcoming network rule change. Notably, the firm is not insolvent and it remains unclear if the bankruptcy will mark the end of the company\'s operations or if it will restructure.\n\nCalled a \'halving\' event, the upcoming change will find the amount of rewards paid to new miners dropping from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC, a 50% decrease in potential profitability should the price not rise to offset the loss.\n\nOnce one of the larger bitcoin mining firms, KnC raised $32m in venture funding for its mining hardware products.\n\nHowever, the company faced continued customer criticism for allegedly defective products and shipping issues that eventually forced it out of the business-to-consumer hardware market.\n\nRepresentatives from KnCMiner did not respond to requests for further details.\n\nBusiness meeting image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He is also an advisor to the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the world’s largest trade association representing the digital asset and blockchain industry.\n\nIn this op-ed, Batteh offers a perspective on the recent settlement between Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nBusinesses may loathe burdensome regulation, but they almost always welcome regulatory certainty, even if they are certain they don’t like the particular regulation. Regulatory certainty is predictable and allows businesses to comply with rules, to plan, and to avoid risks, like the risk of the government deciding to shut down their business.\n\nMany of my clients tell me they would rather know what the rules are, even if they are bad rules, than operate in an uncertain regulatory environment with the threat of a costly enforcement action looming.\n\nTrading in digital currencies or “tokens” – including bitcoin – is becoming more commonplace.\n\nToday, bitcoin, ether and hundreds of other tokens are traded on global exchanges. While we can all be certain that digital currencies are here to stay, regulatory certainty around the exchange trading of digital currencies is lacking in many jurisdictions.\n\nExchanges play an important function in the blockchain ecosystem because they provide a place for price discovery of digital tokens, which is one of the key components of secure and successful blockchains.\n\nHaving regulatory certainty around the exchange trading of digital currency is a prerequisite to further mainstream investment in blockchain technology. Businesses want to know that there are regulated, well-run exchanges for the trading of digital tokens which support the blockchains they use.\n\nLatest settlement\n\nLast week, the CFTC took yet another step in providing greater regulatory certainty for participants in digital currency markets when it announced its latest bitcoin enforcement case against Bitfinex.\n\nBefore discussing the significance of this case, it is helpful to understand the evolution of CFTC regulation in this area.\n\nLast year, the CFTC affirmatively planted a flag in the world of digital currency when the agency stated, in two separate enforcement actions, that digital currencies are “commodities” for the purpose of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA” or the “Act”).\n\nThe two settlement orders stand for the proposition that digital currencies are encompassed in the definition of, and properly defined as, “commodities,” within the Act. Accordingly, digital currencies are subject to the applicable provisions of the CEA and its attendant regulations. This is particularly important to keep in mind in the context of trading digital currencies on exchanges.\n\nThe CFTC has a long history of aggressive enforcement in the area of retail foreign currency (“forex,” or “FX”) and commodity trading on so-called “spot” exchanges. Spot trading occurs when two parties buy and sell a commodity, “on the spot,” and the exchange occurs instantly; by analogy, think of cash on the barrel. This type of trading is largely outside the jurisdiction of the CFTC.\n\nA short review of CFTC cases highlights many enforcement actions involving fraudulent schemes whereby individuals or companies acted as brokers or exchanges offering spot forex trading to retail customers. Offering parties in these cases told investors that they could control large positions with a small initial investment (i.e., leveraged trading).\n\nUnbeknownst to the customer, there never was any foreign currency. The fraudsters would solicit customers to place buy and sell orders, but there was never any counterparty to buy or sell the commodity.\n\nIn fact, there was nobody on the other side of the trade: just the fraudster who would abscond with the customer’s funds. The traded commodity was never actually delivered to the customer, and instead, it was either held by the operator of the scheme or non-existent. By the time the fraud was realized, the investor’s money was long gone.\n\nWhile the CFTC was sometimes successful in bringing these “boiler room” cases, the jurisdictional hurdle of proving that these so-called spot contracts were actually futures contracts within the CFTC’s jurisdiction was high.\n\nAgency response\n\nIn response to these scams, the CFTC did two things: 1) it began to aggressively pursue enforcement cases against these bad actors, shutting down their businesses and obtaining civil monetary penalties (“CMP”), disgorgement of ill-gotten profits, and in some cases, compensation for customer losses whenever possible; and 2) it obtained a legislative change via Section 742 of the Dodd-Frank Act, by adding Section 2(c)(2)(D) to the CEA in 2010.\n\nThis amendment makes it easier for the CFTC to shut down these types of exchanges. The statutory change provides the CFTC the authority to bring a cause of action against unregistered operators offering leveraged, margined, or financed trading of commodities (like bitcoin or other digital currencies).\n\nCEA Section 2(c)(2)(D)’s jurisdictional provision applies broadly to any agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodity that is entered into with, or offered to (even if not entered into with), a retail customer on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis.\n\nThe Section further provides that such an agreement, contract, or transaction is subject to Sections 4(a), 4(b), and 4b of the Act “as if the agreement, contract, or transaction was a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery.”\n\nIn layman’s terms, in most cases, if you are offering trading in leveraged commodity contracts, you have to trade them on a registered futures exchange such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Intercontinental Exchange. Bye bye margin trading on unregistered digital currency exchanges. But wait! There is an important exception.\n\nSection 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(III)(aa) excepts from the CFTC’s jurisdiction, a contract of sale that results in “actual delivery” within 28 days …” The term “actual delivery” is clarified somewhat in an interpretive guidance issued by the CFTC in 2013. Under the guidance, unless the commodity is delivered to the customer in full, including the leveraged or financed portion of the trade, actual delivery will be deemed to have not been made.\n\nArguably, the Bitfinex settlement touches on all of these issues. The CFTC alleged that Bitfinex offered financed bitcoin trading without actually delivering bitcoins to the customer in certain instances.\n\nInstead, according to the CFTC, Bitfinex held customers’ bitcoin at the exchange. In response to discussions with the CFTC, Bitfinex made changes to its offering to come into compliance with the CEA. While the concept of delivery is evolving and novel in the digital token space, given that Bitfinex still offers financed trading, one can assume that Bitfinex has received an overt (or at least tacit) blessing from the CFTC to continue financed trading.\n\nWhile no company wants to be hit with an enforcement action, the outcome of this case is notable and somewhat remarkable. As part of the settlement, Bitfinex agreed to a CMP of $75,000 for alleged violations of the CEA.\n\nMajor takeaways\n\nA $75,000 CMP might seem like a big number, but in the world of CFTC enforcement settlements, this is tiny and the equivalent to a slap on the wrist or a speeding ticket. Let’s unpack how the CFTC got to this relatively low civil penalty.\n\nFirst, the CFTC went out of its way to acknowledge Bitfinex’s cooperation and the fact that Bitfinex affirmatively contacted the CFTC before the Coinflip settlement was issued (i.e., before the world knew for certain that the CFTC views bitcoin as a commodity).\n\nBased on the facts set out in this order, it appears that Bitfinex tried to be a good corporate citizen and to affirmatively seek regulatory clarity from the CFTC. Bitfinex actively cooperated with the CFTC and provided information to the CFTC on a voluntary basis.\n\nSecond, almost as important as what is in the order, is what is not explicitly stated in the order. There is no allegation of fraudulent conduct on the part of Bitfinex (i.e., they were not running a pump-and-dump scheme or misappropriating customer funds). Bitfinex was not cheating customers. They were just trying to navigate regulatory uncertainty.\n\nThird, Bitfinex took affirmative, remedial steps to make sure their activity comported with the delivery requirements of the CFTC before the CFTC asked them to do so. As noted above, the order acknowledges that Bitfinex made changes to its offering to attempt to come into compliance.\n\nWhile Bitfinex avoided a crushing blow from the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, other exchange operators should consider themselves on notice.\n\nIt is very likely that the CFTC will take a much more punitive approach to exchanges that continue to offer leveraged trading that does not comport with the letter and spirit of the delivery requirements. A digital currency exchange operator that does not comply with the leveraged commodity trading rule can expect to be the subject of an enforcement proceeding – which will likely entail a costly investigation, a hefty CMP, and the possibility of being shut down.\n\nA trader trying to decide where to trade digital currency should strongly weigh the exchange’s history and its willingness to engage with regulators. While a CMP levied by a regulator won’t affect the funds of the trader, one must consider the exchange’s long-term ability to operate and to remain solvent if it were to be hit with a sizable fine.\n\nIn the end, this settlement should be seen as a positive development for all exchanges, traders and the miners who are the backbone of blockchains.\n\nGreater regulatory certainty will lead to stronger and more secure blockchains by ensuring that businesses can invest in blockchains knowing that they have a robust, regulated market for price discovery, and that miners are fairly compensated for their efforts with fairly priced digital currencies.\n\nAuthor's Note: I acknowledge the help of Kwon Y.

06/07/2016,"['The Winklevoss Twins have described Bitcoin as better than gold because it experiences ‘a lot less volatility’ and is a better store of value at the moment. They cited a Wall Street Journal story in May which described how the virtual currency has been more stable than gold over the last 28 days.\n\nTyler Winklevoss said:\n\n“So I think investors who have gold in their portfolio and other precious metals have started to look to Bitcoin as a better store of value. It’s got better characteristics than gold itself. So it’s actually better at being gold than gold. We are seeing investors recognise that and that’s what the idea would germinate into.”\n\nHe added the need to ensure that licenses are regulated and there is compliance with exchange high capitalization requirements.\n\nStore of value\n\nSpeaking on Bloomberg TV, the two co-founders of Gemini Trust, say they see Bitcoin as a digital gold or a better version of gold as a store of value which reacts particularly in situations where there is a crisis or when people want a safe haven for their wealth.\n\nCameron Winklevoss says:\n\n“Historically, when there’s been a crisis, interest in Bitcoins and these types of assets increases naturally because of their fixed supply.”\n\nOn their expansion to Canada, they say the country has been watching the space very closely after a related paper had been written by the Senate Committee on Banking about a year ago.\n\nCameron added:', 'Digital currency Bitcoin is variously promoted as an alternative to gold, a good way to make international transfers, or the future of e-commerce. New research suggests that companies are now stockpiling Bitcoin for a different reason: so they can pay up quickly if their data is held ransom by malicious software.\n\nRansomware, as it is called, has locked up the data of huge numbers of individuals and businesses in recent years. Many of them, including police departments and hospitals, have opted to pay up to get their data back.\n\nA small survey by corporate networking company Citrix indicates that some IT professionals are even stockpiling bitcoins so they can pay up quickly in the event ransomware strikes their network. Out of 250 IT and security workers at U.K. companies with more than 250 employees, a third said they were stockpiling the currency. A researcher at Cornell recently tweeted that the university’s treasurer created an account with the Bitcoin exchange Coinbase so as to be ready if ransomware struck.\n\nAlmost half of respondents in the Citrix survey said that company data was not backed up at least daily. Security experts advise that backups are the best defense against ransomware and generally discourage paying off ransomware, since it encourages the industry.\n\nHolding Bitcoin in reserve could help a company without backups get back online faster. Most companies have no reason to have a Bitcoin account otherwise. Having one ready to go could save precious time during which a company can’t operate as normal.\n\nJust how many companies are setting aside ransom money in advance is probably hard to know because it’s something they may be loath to advertise. Acknowledging that you are ready to pay—and perhaps don’t have a good backup system—could attract the attacks this policy is designed to handle.\n\n(Read more: “With Hospital Ransomware Infections, the Patients Are at Risk,” “Holding Data Hostage: the Perfect Internet Crime”)', ""Banks know Blockchain is a threat to the linchpin of their economics: the customer relationship, and the $1.7 trillion they made in 2014 from global payments revenue which is a massive 40% of their annual profits.\n\nHistorically the banking industry has provided three main services: financing, investment and transactions. And now they seem to dismiss Bitcoin publicly and highlight the distributed ledger or Blockchain.\n\nDo we really need a middleman?\n\nThe customer relationship is the glue that binds the banking institutions together and keeps this type of profit rolling in. Although after taxpayers taking the hit to their pocket over the recklessness of bankers’ decisions which caused the global recession in 2008 and the introduction of a decentralised global currency that removes the need for middlemen and expensive fees, does the customer really trust or even need banks in their current state anymore?\n\n2014 was an extraordinary year for the global payments industry with even the most optimistic expectations clearly exceeded and revenues growing by double from 4% in previous years to 9% in 2013 to 2014, taking their profit from $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion and global payments increasing its share of the total bank revenue from 38% to 40%.\n\nAccording to a report by McKensie, this revenue from global payments is set to continue to rise at a relatively stable annual rate of 6% during the next 4 years, exceeding $2 trillion by 2020.\n\nWill the banks rivals survive this time around?\n\nWhile banks have always faced competition, history has shown that most of their rivals rarely gain a solid footing. During the dot com boom of 1997 to 2000, less than 10% of payment startups survived, with PayPal being the most notable.\n\nHowever, the majority of experts are expecting this time around to be different.\n\nNever before have banks had competition from the largest and most valuable companies in the world such as Apple, Samsung, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Alibaba.\n\nThese companies have loyal and highly engaged user bases, are integrated into many aspects of their customers’ lives and have massive cash reserves. Combine this with them having the benefit of revenue streams beyond payments and you have formidable competitors.\n\nSmartphones with smart payments services\n\nAndroid Pay means more Android platform users for Google; AliPay means more e-commerce sales for Alibaba; Apple Pay means more iPhones are sold, enabling them to reap value from the existing payments value chain and upend pricing models by providing payments services either free or for significantly below-market prices.\n\nGlobal smartphone penetration by population is expected to exceed 50 percent by 2017 and as more users become accustomed to how they can accommodate a variety of their everyday needs, there will be a shift from the use of bank apps to third party financial service apps by a segment of users.\n\nIn the United States, 33% of millennials aged between 15 and 33 believe that within the next five years they will not need a bank at all.\n\nRemember even though Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and AliPay can offer cheaper transactions for the reasons stated above, there is still the Visa, American Express and MasterCard fees which take a chunk out of retailers’ profits.\n\nThe biggest threat of all to banks profit\n\nThis is where the biggest threat of all to banks profit in payment revenue comes in as the digital currency Bitcoin. It eliminates the need for banks, credit and debit cards completely, offering secure, global and instant payments with practically no cost to the payer or receiver.\n\nFinancial institutions, central banks and payment processors know that the Blockchain is the greatest technological innovation in generations and it makes their existing systems seem outdated and will eventually make them obsolete.\n\nThey know with the rising adoption of smartphones and non-bank based payment applications, and the technology behind Bitcoin simplifies for users over time, their trillions in profit of payment revenue every year is in danger of disappearing.\n\nThey can’t take control of it, they don’t even know how to regulate it, and they are fully aware that at this stage they can’t even stop it.\n\nBitcoin vs. Controllable Blockchain\n\nTheir only option is to ignore the word, dismiss it as tainted and try and hoodwink mainstream society into the trend of using a new buzzword like Blockchain or distributed ledger while convincing them of the benefits of their Blockchain which they can control and at the same time retain some profits from.\n\nWhen you realise that this is a fight for $1.7 trillion a year in profit, which is 40% of the bank's total global revenue, you can understand why they prefer to use the term Blockchain instead of Bitcoin.\n\nIn the long run I don’t think the name used will matter much as the honey badger of money is still on an unstoppable journey to mainstream adoption over eight years later with transactions and trading volume at all time highs."", 'The National Front wants to preserve cash and ban Bitcoin, which it sees as an unsafe form of payment. The EU has yet to legislate on the subject. EURACTIV France reports.\n\nIn its economic policy, the extreme-right National Front (NF) is often radical and unconventional. The party’s position on electronic currencies is no exception: it simply wants to ban them.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the party’s president, published a press release in May, in which she called on French citizens to reject what she called the “alienation” brought about by virtual currencies and the decline of cash.\n\nIn the same statement, she attacked Bitcoin and the European Central Bank’s decision to stop printing the €500 note.\n\n“The survival tactics of the financial oligarchs are to avoid any possible leakage of their clients’ money through massive withdrawals outside the banking system. Cash, notes and coins, become the enemy,” Le Pen wrote.\n\nThe NF is also a harsh critic of the progressive disappearance of cash payments, for which the limit in France was reduced from €7,500 to €1,000 in 2015.\n\nSuspicious bank notes lead to Luxembourg One third of all cash in circulation in the eurozone is now in the form of €500 notes. Suspicions have been raised over Luxembourg, which prints double its GDP in banknotes each year. EURACTIV France reports.\n\nAccording to the MEP Bernard Monot, the National Front’s economic specialist, the party would ban the use of virtual currencies, but would not completely eradicate them.\n\n“If we were in power, the only legal tender would be the new French Franc, which would have an equal value to the ECU, the euro currency that would remain. Because we want to keep a common euro currency on an international level,” he told the French newspaper le Figaro.\n\nIn his latest “economic bulletin” video, Monot said Bitcoin was a subject that had to be taken very seriously.\n\n“The most worrying thing is that this currency, which has appeared out of nowhere, is not legal tender and has no guarantee. It is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme,” he said.\n\nA Ponzi scheme is an investment scam whereby investors receive returns paid with the capital from new investors, rather than legitimate profits.\n\nMonot argued that the blockchain mechanism itself, a public record of all Bitcoin transactions and their beneficiaries, should be saved as it might have other legitimate uses, but that the use of the virtual currency should be banned.\n\nBundesbank unsure about phasing out €500 notes Germany’s central bank has cast doubt on what impact abolishing the €500 note would have on money laundering and the financing of terrorism. EURACTIV Germany reports.\n\nThe European Parliament adopted a report on virtual currencies on 25 May, which called for a “proportionate regulatory approach” from the Union, taking care not to stifle innovation and generate unnecessary extra costs.\n\nThe Commission has been examining the subject for some time, but has yet to make any concrete proposals.', 'The head of a major far-right political party in France has called for ending the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies in the European country.\n\nIn a note published last last month, Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front and its expected candidate in the 2017 French presidential election, accused world leaders of seeking to create a world with no cash and positioned bitcoin as an effort fueled by Wall Street power brokers.\n\nLe Pen wrote:\n\n""The powerful business lobby Wall Street banks (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs) relayed by the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2016, sold two ideas to states and institutions like the EU: virtual currencies or cryptocurrencies (the best known is the bitcoin) and a cashless society.""\n\nLe Pen went on to write that her party believes that a currency is a ""national public good, given [to] the sovereign people"", and that the digitization of money will result in broader financial monitoring by the world’s governments.\n\n""Therefore, in the context of the implementation of its model of economic patriotism, [the National Front] will prevent the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in France,"" she wrote.\n\nWhether the National Front, which maintains a small presence in the country’s legislature, could enact this policy goal remains to be seen.\n\nRecent polls suggest that the National Front could capture a significant number of votes in the presidential election, with the first round set for April of next year followed by a run-off in May among the top two candidates.\n\nLe Pen is expected to face off against sitting French president Francois Hollande as well as Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France who was unseated by Hollande in 2012.\n\nImage Credit: Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The ledger is made up of blocks of transactions linked in a chain, forming the widely touted technological breakthrough, the Blockchain.\n\nIndividual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid, Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function. This process is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult, and the protocol provides a block reward to incentivize miners. The reward is also a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.\n\nThe block reward currently supplements transaction fees, paid at the user's discretion. As more users send bitcoin transactions, and blocks become full, those transactions with the highest fees will be included first. This guarantees a swift transaction for users willing to pay more, and is designed to eventually fund the entire process of mining. However, transaction fees are currently average less than half a bitcoin per block.\n\nWhile the reward currently supplements the fees, the amount of bitcoins rewarded is designed to reduce over time, halving every 210,000 blocks. With fewer than 5000 blocks remaining till the next halving event, predicted to occur on July 10th this year, the reward is poised to decrease from 25 bitcoins per block, to 12.5.\n\n- The Bitcoin Foundation\n\n\n\nWhile the event, and the mechanics that drive it, are well documented and understood, the potential ramifications are hotly debated. What the greater bitcoin mining community will do in response is currently impossible to know.\n\nSimple arithmetic would seem to indicate that miners with less-efficient mining equipment may be inclined to shut down their operations. Large mining operations often have several locations, with hundreds or thousands of mining 'rigs' at each. Aside from the initial setup costs, the main ongoing expense is electricity.\n\nChandler Guo, founder of Chinese multi-service bitcoin banking platform Bitbank fears that the reduced reward may lead to fewer miners. “When halving comes the cost of the electricity is the same, so it must shut down,” Guo explained. “If mining equipment can only mine the electricity payment, they don’t need to work.”\n\nThe problem that Guo points out is Bitcoin's difficulty rate. To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running mining operations, the proof-of-work difficulty number is determined by a moving average, targeting an average of six blocks per hour. If blocks are generated too fast, the difficulty increases, and vice versa. This re-balancing occurs every 2016 blocks, roughly every two weeks, and has the effect of ensuring that miners produce the right number of blocks. According to Guo, it might also have more scary effects under a halving condition.\n\nDuring an interview with CoinDesk, Guo made the bold claim that the blockchain could shut down;\n\n- Chandler Guo, Bitbank Founder, speaking to coindesk.\n\nWhile Guo highlights a worst case scenario for the fledgling alternative financial system, he also highlights the systems saving grace; the value of bitcoins on the open market. Miners pay their bills in fiat currency.\n\nImmediately after the 2012 halving, there was a month or so of downward price movement, and then 2013 then became one of the most bullish and exciting years in Bitcoin's history. So the question becomes whether or not the 2012 block reward halving was one of the causes of that bullishness. Many feel that it was not; the market price reflects the event well in advance.\n\n- TheHalvening.com\n\nThe price of bitcoin rose gradually over the six-month period leading up to the 2012 halving, more than doubling in price between June and November 2012\n\nThis effect could easily be explained by traders preemptively pricing in increased scarcity. Bitcoin developer David Perry pondered this issue in his last-minute blog post preceding the 2012 event. A poll of the community showed that far more people believed the value of bitcoin would rise more after the halving, but they didn't seem to consider it priced-in before the event. The debate and theoretical discussion continue to this day.\n\nOther than the previous bitcoin reward reduction, the closest thing we have to another halving happened on the Litecoin blockchain, last August. TheHalvening.com website states that, “a wild speculative rally took the price from 2$ to more than 8$, before crashing back to 3$,” two months prior to the event. It is now starting to look like Bitcoin's price may be headed in the right direction to match the doubling in time as well.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has nearly doubled over the last six months\n\nWhile commentators can only speculate what the price will be on block 420,000, the trend is certainly headed higher, with Bitcoin approaching $600.\n\nIf the price at halving is $600, miners will effectively be earning the same reward as they did with bitcoin at $300 - a price point that the cryptocurrency was below for much of 2015. The hashrate increased 78% in 2015.\n\nIf the price were to go above $700 before the halving, an amount that is double where we were six months previously, then miners would be compensated at roughly the same rate after the halving event as they were in February. Not only would that defeat the purpose for Guo's concerns; it would also be the best evidence yet for the popular theory that doubling happens in advance of halvings. More importantly, however, it is an indicator that miners will be able to stay profitable in the long run."", 'Bitcoin (BTC) is a virtual currency, using encryption algorithms and priding itself with anonymity of transactions and low fees. Since its development, back in 2009, it managed to rise from 20-30 USD, to over 580 USD for one BTC, nowadays. This huge increase also attracted traders interested to gain from the fluctuations. But how profitable really is the BTC trading?\n\nLet’s start with one characteristic that impacts significantly the trading process: liquidity. Or the lack thereof. While not being controlled by any central bank or authority, the bitcoin is not that liquid, and the actual amount of BTC is limited. It reached, now, some 15 millions, with an expectancy to get to 21 million in several decades. This low liquidity is the root of all evils, but most of all, it brings high volatility. A small amount of BTC sold over less significant business news can move the value downwards, or in return, a buying spree can up the value without a concrete reason. In an attempt to go around the lack of liquidity, and maybe limit volatility, exchanges came up with a palliative solution: BTC holders can, let’s say “borrow” them to those in the market who want to trade BTC, but do not have enough. The borrower pays back the borrowed amount at a fix date and with a specific interest.\n\nNot many leveraging solution\n\nMoreover, if other markets allow you to leverage your positions, the BTC trading is rather poor in such solutions. The system is quite limited. For instance, hedging is somewhat restricted to miners – those who keep track of BTC and add them to the block chain. Thus, the main characteristic of a futures contract, for example, is blocked: in order to hedge against potential losses, you need for others to continue trading. But if no one else does, then your contract is useless, and you need to keep it until trading picks up. Not a good opportunity in a low liquidity market.\n\nMore profitable investment options in stock exchange\n\nUnder these circumstances, you may need to look elsewhere on the market for your trading needs. For instance, a better solution than trading BTC would be contract for difference (CFD). Let’s take CFD on shares. CFD is an instrument that follows a certain asset, in this case, a share. The CFD holder does not have to buy the actual shares, but the contract that allows him to cash in if the respective shares go up. This instrument offers high leverage. Depending on the broker, you CFD may come with stops or limits. And maybe some very important features: no trading fee with the brokers and no expiring date. For instance, a 5% margin to start a trade, let’s you cash in 100% ROI provided the respective share increases by 5%. And with a huge market such as the stock exchange, the opportunities are considerably higher compared to BTC trading. And with lower capital.\n\nAll in all, the bitcoin trading can offer some investment opportunities, but it also limits the options. The lack of liquidity is a major setback in the evolution of this digital currency.', ""As blockchain fever is taking hold of prominent financial industry firms around the globe, two men from Kentucky believe to have found the key to rewire international supply chain infrastructure.\n\nFluent cofounders Lamar Wilson (CEO and developer) and Lafe Taylor (CDO) recently unveiled the Fluent Network, a blockchain-based financial operating network to streamline supply chain finance. And they've got $2.5 million in seed funding to back their efforts.\n\nFrom Pheeva Wallet to Blockchain Startup\n\nWilson and Taylor, who previously founded the Pheeva Bitcoin wallet for iOS, are not your typical Stanford-dropout fintech architects.\n\nFar removed from both the old money in the incumbent financial sector, as well as the new money in Silicon Valley, Wilson and Taylor met at their high school in Lexington, Kentucky. Having first discovered Bitcoin back in 2011, the two founded the Pheeva wallet in 2014, the only iOS-compatible Bitcoin wallet throughout Apple's anti-Bitcoin era.\n\nIn that same year, 2014, Wilson and Taylor also increasingly shifted their focus to Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain. And – like many others – they became convinced that the innovative distributed ledger technology could fuel a parallel revolution to Bitcoin's: a revolution specifically geared toward removing friction from the existing financial infrastructure.\n\nBuilding on this vision, Wilson and Taylor founded their second venture, Fluent. And, after months of research, they pinpointed a niche they believed could be significantly improved by blockchain technology: supply chain finance. Mirroring logistical supply chains, often composed of dozens or even hundreds of production steps, supply chain finance consists of a long series of ledgers and processes maintained by individual operators.\n\nThis is an inefficient infrastructure, ripe for disruption, according to Taylor:\n\n“Most financial supply chains right now consist of very siloed and opaque systems, which is tremendously inefficient. And, to make it worse, large companies at the head of these supply chains typically push out payment terms as far as possible to increase their cash flow. This puts a lot of pressure on suppliers in particular; they need the cash as fast as they can in order to pay their employees, buy raw materials, and other expenses.”\n\nThe solution, Wilson and Taylor believe, is blockchain technology.\n\nIn particular, the Fluent Network benefits from the introduction of tokenized invoices. Tracking and approving invoices on a blockchain prevents them from being refinanced (“double-spent”), but perhaps more important: significant stages of the payment process can be automated and harmonized.\n\nWilson:\n\n“Buyers, for instance, approve of invoices on the Fluent Network once they consider goods delivered to be satisfactory. The buyer of a good on the due date can automatically pay the invoice directly to whomever owns the invoice even if it has been partially financed by multiple parties or subsequently purchased by other finance providers. A single platform with cryptographically verified invoices, instant settlement and low operating costs benefits all parties on the system. It’s a win-win-win for the buyer, supplier and financier.”\n\nA Blockchain on Top of Banking\n\nThe Fluent Network's blockchain is largely based on Bitcoin's architecture, but purpose-built for global supply chains with specific focus on invoicing and payments. It is perhaps best described as a blockchain layer on top of the existing banking infrastructure. The actual funds – typically U.S. dollars – remain in custody of banks at all times, though they are tokenized and represented on the blockchain, too. The network is to be rolled out among financial institutions, as well as global enterprises that take part in the supply chain.\n\nUnique to the Fluent Network, the custom-built private blockchain is comprised of a hybrid consensus model, with both a federated system as well as proof-of-work security. The proof-of-work security – SHA-256 – works similar to the way it does in Bitcoin, but with one great difference: mining is not an open process anyone can participate in, but a closed circuit where participants are permissioned by Fluent.\n\n“Participants of a supply chain, including financial institutions, can sign up to become a node and miner on the Fluent Network,” Taylor explained. “As a federated system, participants do require permission to mine; we know who the miners are, as does the rest of the network. But within this permissioned infrastructure, we solidify the core with a proof-of-work system. Think of giving permission to your neighbors to come to an open house but locking up the good China for extra security. Also, because we know who the miners are, we don't need nearly as much hashing power as you would on a permissionless blockchain.”\n\nAnd while miners on the network – the financial institutions and other companies – can't earn a native token by mining, the Fluent team believes securing the network should be incentive enough.\n\nAccording to Wilson, “This could prove to be an important step in opening up and connecting to trustless value chains in an industry 4.0 economy. Blockchains, at the end of the day, are fantastic tools with a specific purpose. We plan on using the best tool for the job.”\n\nWilson and Taylor are not the only ones to think so. Fluent closed a pre-seed financing round last year, raising a total of $875,000, followed by $1.65 million in seed funding in 2016 in a round led by ff Venture Capital, with participation from institutional investors including Tim Draper's Draper Associates, Thomson Reuters, 500 Startups, UMB Bank and SixThirty. The platform is now being tested, with participants including a top-ten bank on Forbes’ 2015 America’s Best Bank list. Fluent will be presenting a demo of the Fluent Network at next week's Distributed: Trade conference in St. Louis hosted by BTC Media, Bitcoin Magazine's parent company."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

06/08/2016,"['Editor’s note: The quote “It is not possible to start running a contract on Counterparty testnet with the current node” has been edited to reflect that it is “now possible” to run a contract on the testnet with the existing code.\n\nCounterparty, the technology for decentralized financial tools on the Bitcoin blockchain, has started running Ethereum smart contracts by porting the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to its codebase.\n\nIn late 2014, Counterparty added their support to execute the Ethereum smart contracts platform on Bitcoin; however, at that time, Ethereum was in its pre-alpha stage of development, with its first major release, Frontier, not yet being announced. Of course, with both Frontier, and later, the release of Homestead in late February, the developers at Counterparty have witnessed the EVM growing nicely. The end result was to create a contract that would work with Ethereum, Counterparty, and Bitcoin, which they seem to have achieved, according to Counterparty Core Developer, Ruben de Vries. He stated:\n\nIt is now possible to start running a contract on Counterparty testnet with the current code.\n\nSpeaking to CCN, director of the Counterparty Foundation, Trevor Altpeter, said that Ethereum’s added functionality on the Bitcoin blockchain means that Counterparty’s EVM can do everything that Ethereum is able to do except it occurs on the Bitcoin blockchain instead.\n\nThe only differences are Bitcoin specific such as longer block times compared to Ethereum,” he said. “Counterparty’s EVM port will allow users to create and deploy decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), DAPPS, and smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSince its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin has been the most widely used digital currency, the most valuable digital currency, and the most secure blockchain. Naturally, then, Ethereum’s added functionality on the blockchain means that the security provided by the digital currency is one of the largest benefits relative to any other existing blockchains.\n\nAnother benefit is the fact that Counterparty uses Bitcoin addresses directly, which is “the logical progression given Bitcoin’s currency dominance in cryptocurrency,” said Altpeter. “It has the added benefit of limiting the number of blockchains, private keys, and various coin specifics that must be managed when interacting with one or more alternative blockchains.\n\nPut simply, this means you can hold Bitcoin, Counterparty (XCP), and Counterparty assets in the same Bitcoin address where they can all share one private key making key management and security much easier.\n\nPorting the EVM permits Counterparty to facilitate Ethereum style smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. This is because the smart contracts on Ethereum and Counterparty share a common coding language called Solidity. It is this ability to use the exact same coding language for the smart contracts that enables developers who are able to make use of Ethereum to make use of Counterparty’s EVM too.\n\nCounterparty is more interested in working with Ethereum than causing hostility,” said Altpeter. “This ultimately means an increased amount of developers who can take advantage of these new features.\n\nHe adds:\n\nIf Bitcoin experiences more long-term success than Ethereum some developers may choose to use Counterparty’s EVM on Bitcoin instead, but if Ethereum is ultimately unsuccessful, which is not what we are hoping for, developers familiar with Solidity can keep moving forward.\n\nCounterparty EVM Benefits\n\nThe benefits of Counterparty’s EVM port regarding Bitcoin is the ability to execute smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain, whereas specific to Counterparty, the benefits extend to the use of Counterparty assets within the EVM.\n\nCounterparty assets can be used as access tokens, in-game currencies, or cryptocurrencies in their own right, such as Storj, which was launched via Counterparty and is a decentralized cloud storage service that is currently a part of Microsoft’s Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform,” said Altpeter. “Most use cases for Counterparty assets and smart contracts are likely yet to be discovered due to how new this technology is.\n\nOf course, from the perspective of a Bitcoin user, this port is important for the long-term health of Bitcoin. Every project lost to Ethereum due to Bitcoin’s technical limitations constitutes a loss of developer talent, users and, critically, Bitcoin transaction fees.\n\nCounterparty Smart Contract Hype\n\nRecently, there has been a lot of hype surrounding smart contracts, but Counterparty’s view is that it will take some time for smart contracts to reach their full potential, similar to the trajectory of Bitcoin. It is important to understand that most uses for smart contracts rely on the ability to escrow value and since Bitcoin is the most valuable blockchain by a substantial margin it is the only blockchain that currently accommodates this niche.\n\nUse cases for smart contracts that involve escrowing value are dependent on Bitcoin and Ethereum continuing to increase in value,” said Altpeter. “If these cryptocurrencies continue to grow in value, you will see smart contract uses grow in tandem.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Counterparty.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Having launched alongside bitcoin in 2009, the blockchain is now guaranteeing everything from diamond trading to bets on prediction markets iStock/mustafahacalaki\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeanne Kemp is using the blockchain in an unconventional way: to fight crime. The system created to run the bitcoin cryptocurrency has often been associated with less than reputable activities – from drug trafficking to ransomware payments – but Everledger is using the blockchain for good. Kemp’s London based firm tracks diamond ownership, helping traders and insurers monitor the provenance of jewels and spot stolen or conflict zone diamonds.\n\n\n\nSo far, 858,890 diamonds have been entered onto the firm\'s ledger. Each gem is scanned to glean forty unique points that are condensed into what Kemp calls ""the diamond’s digital thumbprint"". This is then attached to the smallest quantity of bitcoin available (a satoshi, in homage to the cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous creator) transforming the coin into a stand-in for the diamond on a blockchain ledger. The unique ID moves every time the diamond changes hands, leaving an unalterable digital trail of ownerships back to its origin. Everledger also built a smaller, private blockchain for transactions within the industry. The company has so far received £500,000 in funding.\n\nKemp, who has a background in both technology and jewellery, thinks the model could be adapted for items other than diamonds, from art to watches and even luxury cars. Finding a surefire way to confirm something’s provenance has far-reaching implications. “The question of authenticity is key because, for instance, counterfeit goods are funding terrorist activities,” Kemp tells WIRED. “We can apply this technology to solve very big problems: ivory poaching, blood diamonds, all these big ‘blood problems’ that are helping cartels, terrorists and criminals.”\n\n\n\nWhen Kemp first heard of bitcoin she didn’t care about its potential as a new form of money. What piqued her interest was the computer-powered infrastructure where the “digital gold” was being exchanged: the blockchain. “When I saw bitcoin, for me, it was just natural that you could decouple currency and ledger,” she says. The bitcoin-mania that propelled it to a peak value of £625 in November 2013 has faded in the face of the cryptocurrency’s volatility and limited scalability. But in its place is the promise and potential of the blockchain.\n\n\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin in 2008, his anarcho-libertarian idea was to let people directly exchange electronic money. His model removed the need for central banks, governments, or PayPal-like corporations to act as guardians and enforcers of financial transactions. Bitcoin’s guarantor is the blockchain, a ledger of every transaction that is distributed across a vast network of computers or nodes.\n\n“We can apply this technology to solve very big problems: ivory poaching, blood diamonds, all these big ’blood problems’ that are helping cartels, terrorists and criminals” Leanne Kemp, CEO and founder, Everledger\n\nRead next Bitcoin\'s scaling problems mean it won\'t make it as a currency Bitcoin\'s scaling problems mean it won\'t make it as a currency\n\nThe ledger is public, available for anyone to check, and its content is updated collectively by thousands of computers. Some of these computers invest considerable amounts of power to cluster transactions into time-stamped blocks, a process called mining. While the system was devised for payments, its features – security, decentralisation, transparency – have piqued interest in a myriad of other industries. And from Greece to Estonia, governments are looking at how the blockchain could make bureaucratic tasks quicker and tamperproof.\n\nA 2016 report by the UK government’s chief scientific advisers claimed the technology had the potential to help governments collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries and “in general ensure the integrity of government records and services”. And now banks, the intended victims of the blockchain revolution, are asking firms such as R3 to create private, closed ledgers that borrow some elements of the technology to streamline inter-bank cross-border transfers.\n\nThe failure of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange MtGox led many to question the cryptocurrency\'s future YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe growing interest in blockchain has morphed its concept into something new. Before, the blockchain was simply the spine of the bitcoin network, but today the technology is being used on a burgeoning list of distributed ledgers with varying degrees of openness, security and complexity.\n\nAs Everledger shows, there are some companies that are still using the original bitcoin blockchain, and in innovative ways. Israeli company Colu, for instance, has specialised in ‘colouring’ coins – that is, inscribing metadata on minuscule amounts of Bitcoin in order to transform them into representations of real-world assets (the ownership of a car, the copyright on a song, etc.). Amos Meiri, founder of Colu, says this system could be used “for a bunch of applications, from speeding up financial trading, to making management of music copyright transfer much easier.”\n\n\n\n“We are also increasingly focusing on digital local currencies,” he says. “We have worked together with Barbados to issue ‘digital dollars’ on the blockchain.” Although bitcoin transactions are slower than on banking systems in developed countries, they represent a sea-change in areas such as the Caribbean.\n\nRead next Psychology explains why your friends can\'t shut up about bitcoin Psychology explains why your friends can\'t shut up about bitcoin\n\nFor some, the blockchain isn’t capable of powering its own revolution. Ethereum, a public blockchain platform created by Russo-Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin, builds on Nakamoto’s premise but proposes to do away with middlemen everywhere, not just in finance.\n\n“What’s happened over the last months, is this explosion of startups proposing different blockchain applications to a vast range of areas” Jamie Burke, founder, Outlier Ventures\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum is a blockchain on steroids designed for more than trading cryptocurrency units or ‘coloured’ assets: developers can use it to build programs that interact with the world based on public rules enshrined in so-called smart contracts. Think of a software application that runs a fleet of self-driving cabs and automatically calculates the price of each ride according to some criteria. These criteria are predetermined in the software’s contract and known to all customers.\n\nSuch rules cannot be circumvented – not even by the person who has written the code – and, if they are changed, it will be immediately visible. Users will not have to just hope the company does not swindle them: they know everything it is programmed to do. This is not only about transparency: other smart contracts could allow the cars to pay for their own maintenance and fuel; if its shareholders decide the company needs a new logo, it could follow the rules set up in another contract to launch a competition and outsource the final decision to a service like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. A company governed by a cluster of smart contracts could essentially run itself.\n\nLike bitcoin’s ledger, the software’s code and data are not hosted on any particular server, but scattered across all the computers running Ethereum. This makes it impossible to take down. Uber meets Skynet.\n\nRead next A new cryptocurrency won\'t solve Venezuela\'s economic crisis A new cryptocurrency won\'t solve Venezuela\'s economic crisis\n\n“The industrial revolution allowed us, for the first time, to start replacing human labour with machines,” 22-year-old Buterin wrote in Bitcoin Magazine in 2013. “But this is only automating the bottom; removing the need for rank and file manual labourers [...] Can we remove the management from the equation, instead?”\n\nHis creation might allow for the rise of a legion of fully transparent, self-managing, immortal companies (nicknamed decentralised autonomous organisations, or DAOs), and trigger the decentralisation of the internet on the side.\n\n\n\nConceived of in 2013 and launched in its initial version in 2015, Ethereum has already caught the attention of the likes of Microsoft, IBM and Deloitte. In May, The DAO, a stateless, decentralised venture capital firm whose investments are entirely decided by its shareholders, became one of the first ether companies. The firm raised capital of $168 million from cryptocurrency donations, setting a world record for a crowdfunding campaign.\n\n\n\n“This is a company whose governance is entirely transparent,” says Stephan Tual, chief operating officer at blockchain firm Slock.it and one of the people who worked on The DAO’s framework. “It’s entirely controlled by its users, by those who have invested in it. In a normal company the governance rules, the way decisions are taken are hidden by power plots, intrigues, lies. Here we have code – and rules cannot be changed.”\n\n\n\nHow The DAO invests its money will not be decided by a board, but by its shareholders, who have up to two weeks to vote for or against a proposal. Once the vote has closed, changes are implemented by The DAO. This could be problematic: some have raised doubts as to whether a stateless company’s actions would have legal value under the national laws of the countries where it invests.\n\nSupporters of bitcoin argue the blockchain technology that underpins it will usher in a new era of decentralised systems PHILIPPE LOPEZ/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne of the first investment proposals The DAO will assess is Tual’s own firm. Slock.it is working on applying blockchain technology to the internet of things. Based in Mittweida, Germany, Slock.it has developed a physical smart lock that abides by Ethereum contracts. Ownership and control of these locks would be managed on the blockchain. Want to unlock a bike or an apartment door? You’ll need to make a payment through the blockchain.\n\n\n\nRather than relying on companies such as AirBnB to rent out rooms or apartments, individuals could use the blockchain to capitalise on unutilised space through peer-to-peer blockchain payments. Tuals calls this scenario the “atomised sharing economy.” In Tual’s ideal world, people would be able to rent out their possessions – a drill, a lawnmower, a car – for a couple of hours and get paid for it.\n\n“In a normal company the governance rules, the way decisions are taken are hidden by power plots, intrigues, lies. Here we have code – and rules cannot be changed” Stephan Tual, chief operating officer Slock.it\n\n“If you were to look at the blockchain startup environment only one year ago, finance would have dominated three quarters of it. That is natural, as bitcoin was the blockchain’s first child,” says Jamie Burke, founder of blockchain-focused investment firm Outlier Ventures. “What’s happened over the last months, is this explosion of startups proposing different [blockchain] applications to a vast range of areas.”\n\nFrom prediction markets Augur to digital democracy project BitVote, the blockchain is expanding. In the health sector, Healthchain is letting patients monitor who has access to their medical records. “Many of these projects are very obvious,” says Burke. “But right now it’s not really about coming up with new ideas – it’s all about building the one that works best.”\n\n\n\nAccording to the investment firm’s database, there are currently 878 blockchain startups worldwide, many of which were founded over the last two years. Burke estimates that 70 per cent of them will fail within a few years. Within this group the main distinction is between companies that believe in open source, public blockchains – such as Ethereum and bitcoin – and those that are working to create permissioned ledgers, accessible only to a certain number of known parties. The latter approach is preferred by consortiums of banks and financial organisations, which put a premium on privacy and speed and are generally mistrustful of the bitcoin environment.\n\nThis rift in the nascent cryptocurrency industry is being compared to the early days of the internet when companies relied on closed intranets for internal communications. But, over time, the internet opened up. If analogous to cryptocurrency, this hints that banks – the greatest of all middlemen – will eventually embrace Satoshi’s transparent utopia.\n\n\n\n“What we learnt back then is that intranets are useful for specific, narrow things, and they become less secure and less innovative over time,” says Bitcoin-expert-cum-evangelist Andreas M Antonopoulos. “Systems that live on the internet are constantly exposed to attacks, and become more robust. In other words, what we discovered with the internet is that closed and controlled system are not more secure – open systems, open blockchains, are.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdated 09.06.16: The headline of this article has been updated for clarity', 'With Turkey residents losing a convenient option for sending and receiving payments online, the country’s online payment sector is gradually yielding to a free control market with the uptake in Bitcoin use.\n\nWhy there is no more PayPal in Turkey\n\nPayPal no longer operates in Turkey after June 6 following the non-approval of its license by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency. Its operation in Turkey was reportedly shut down on the grounds that the American company had failed to comply with stipulated laws.\n\nHowever, an existing Bitcoin exchange in the country has claimed it recorded a higher trade volume in the days of the week after the PayPal announcement. Between May 28th and June 3rd, BTCTurk claimed an unprecedented 4696 BTC, or roughly $2.7 million in total volume, according to BTCTurk’s Twitter page.\n\nThe upsurge will likely continue as the market opens up for more players to capture.\n\nNew payment services step in\n\nPayment service provider Bitwala has joined in, filling the inherent gap to be created by Paypal’s exit from Turkey by offering free bank transfers along with Bitcoin services.\n\nBitwala explains to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“As Bitwala is a company build by bitcoiners, we understand the importance and the need for a super convenient, lighting-fast, and low cost way of making payments. We also understand that with PayPal out of the picture, there is a void in options for digital payment that we believe could be filled with the help of Bitcoin. This is why we are offering free transfers to our Turkish users. We believe that people, not the government, should have full ownership and control of their money and have the freedom to choose how they want to handle their financials. We would like to help our users in reaching that goal through the help of our services.”\n\nThe free transfers for Turkish users does not have a specific timeframe, it says, as it was aimed at enabling Turkish users to benefit from using Bitcoin without any form of control by the government.\n\nBitwala adds:', 'The future of money is wedged between a churning fountain drink machine and a few dozen cases of Coca-Cola at The Brown Derby Superstore on the corner of Tulane Avenue and Jefferson Davis Parkway. At least that is how Bobby Sharp sees it.\n\nSharp is co-founder of Coinsource, a Texas company that operates a national network of ATMs dealing in the virtual currency Bitcoin. He spent Tuesday morning (June 7) inside the convenience store feeding $5 bills into its newest machine to demonstrate the basics.\n\nThe ATM is one of the first in Louisiana to cater to Bitcoin users, who Sharp said comprise a small, but growing group in the city. It works similar to a traditional ATM, except, in this case, people instantly turn their cash into virtual currency, he explained.\n\n""This Brown Derby just got really modernized,"" Sharp said grinning.\n\nThe Brown Derby on Tulane Avenue gets a Bitcoin ATM 3 Gallery: The Brown Derby on Tulane Avenue gets a Bitcoin ATM\n\nTwo years ago, Bitcoin captured media fascination thanks to its wild swings in valuation, a growing group of retailers large and small accepting the virtual currency, and questions about its mysterious creator. The buzz has since died down, but techies, early adopters and day-traders continue to tout the currency.\n\nBitcoin is entirely digital. There is no single source or manager of the currency. Transactions are peer-to-peer and recorded in a public digital ledger. You can\'t physically hold Bitcoin, but you can use it to pay for in-store or online purchases from merchants that accept it.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, a single Bitcoin was worth $581.28, more than double its June 2015 value. Bitcoin ATMs like those Coinsource installs allow people to insert as little as $1 to buy fractions of the digital currency.\n\nWhy put a Bitcoin ATM in a Tulane Avenue convenience store? Sharp said the company was getting regular calls from Bitcoin users in New Orleans asking if the company had plans for local ATMs.\n\nSharp said Coinsource typically puts Bitcoin ATMs in centrally located stores with 24-hour access. The Brown Derby, which fronts a bustling ExxonMobil gas station in Mid-City, fit the bill and the store owners were open to the idea.\n\nSharp sees the Bitcoin ATM as the ultimate ambassador in getting more people comfortable using the currency.\n\n""People feel safer about watching the money go into a machine and seeing it happen right before them live,"" Sharp said.\n\nThe Brown Derby is technically the second New Orleans merchant to boast a Bitcoin ATM.\n\nGreg Hill, owner of Cafe Luna, a mellow, oak-shaded coffee shop and cafe on Nashville Avenue, had a Bitcoin ATM installed at his business in April. He worked with locally based Blue Flag Acquisitions to get the machine.\n\nHill uses Bitcoin himself and started accepting the virtual currency at Cafe Luna a year or so ago. He said he does ""a couple hundred dollars"" worth of sales in Bitcoin each year, mostly to a handful of regulars who, like him, are early adopters of the currency.\n\nHill likes the fact Bitcoin can be used anywhere in the world. Unlike credit cards, merchant fees on Bitcoin purchases are less than 2 percent. He can also earn money on the changing value of the digital currency. He said rising Bitcoin values more than covered the taxes he paid on Bitcoin sales last year.\n\n""The global economy is where we\'re headed,"" Hill said. ""This is the ground floor.""\n\nConcerns continue to hang over the digital currency. In its early days, Bitcoin rose to notoriety as the currency of choice in the online black marketplace. The U.S. government and countries around the world have raised alarm about Bitcoin being used to back international criminal activity.\n\nIn May, an Australian tech entrpreneur told BBC News that he had used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto to invent Bitcoin with the help of others in 2009. Craig Wright said he went public to stop the spread of ""misinformation"" about Bitcoin and blockchain, the technical innovation that makes the currency possible.\n\nHill said having a Bitcoin ATM in a New Orleans coffee shop shows everyday people use it.\n\n""It brings it out of the shadows a bit,"" he said.\n\nStill, he has run into the darker side of the currency. A few people with questionable amounts of cash have walked in to use the ATM. Recently a woman entered the shop. Her identity had been hacked and the hacker wanted her to send payment in Bitcoin to relinquish control of her accounts. The woman was upset and convinced Hill was in on the scam.\n\nThe ATMs at The Brown Derby and Cafe Luna are one-way machines, meaning users can purchase Bitcoin but cannot convert the digital currency into cash. Hill\'s machine is limited to $3,000 a day in transactions.\n\nSharp acknowledged a Bitcoin ATM on Tulane Avenue could raise local brows. The corridor, while rapidly changing, brings a recent history as a hub for prostitution and crime. He said he sees a neighborhood attracting a younger, urban crowd, the type who might be willing to give Bitcoin a try.\n\nHe noted Bitcoin users have to give over a lot of information before completing a transaction. Transactions as low as $1 require a telephone number, a unique personal identification number and connection to a digital wallet.\n\nCoinsource red flags users who complete several thousands of dollars of transactions in a short period of time, he said. The company also has a compliance team to make sure the company meets anti-crime standards, including those outlined by Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists.\n\n""We don\'t want this industry to continue to get hit and have black eyes,"" Sharp said.', 'REFUGEES FROM WAR-TORN NATIONS often give up everything they have in an attempt to create a better future for themselves and their families. But in addition to the jobs, property and relations they leave behind, these migrants give up something far more fundamental: their legal identity.\n\nAs they leave their country of origin, refugees will often have their government IDs confiscated and their bank accounts wiped out. Without proof of citizenship, legally speaking, they cease to exist. This loss of identity is compounded...', 'Members of the MIT Media Lab have related in a Medium post what they have learned from designing a system for issuing academic certificates using bitcoin blockchain technology.\n\nThe team released version 1 of its code under its open source license to allow others to experiment with similar ideas. The lab wants to share its ideas behind the design.\n\nThe team members who authored the blog include Juliana Nazare, a graduate student in the Program in Media Arts and Sciences at the lab, Kim Hamilton Duffy, a principal engineer at Learning Machine, and J. Philipp Schmidt, director of learning innovation at the lab.\n\nA Sharing Approach\n\nThe team learned a lot about the way technology can shape socioeconomic practices around the concept of credentials. By sharing its experiences, the team thinks it will help institutions and other developers make use of blockchain architectures.\n\nThe team noted that the most interesting challenges were not technical in nature, but they could not separate the challenges from the technology since small design decisions can impact behavior. Hence, the team took small steps, tested the system with users, and made changes based on what it learned. The team noted the blockchain is still a new technology and the long-term effects of design decisions have to be carefully considered.\n\nThe certification architecture’s design is fairly simple. An issuer signs a digital certificate and stores it hash in a blockchain transaction. The recipient receives a transaction output.\n\nVersion 1: Starting Point\n\nVersion 1 is considered a starting point for other researchers. Institutions seeking to introduce digital credential systems are encouraged to wait for version 2. The MIT team has begun a redesign and will release future versions under the same license.\n\nThere are three repositories in the digital certificate architecture.\n\nCert-schema refers to the digital certificate data standard. Such a certificate is a JSON file with the required fields for the cert-issuer code to put on the blockchain. The team attempted to keep the schema close to the open badges specification as much as possible. They expect the next specification version to be even more closely aligned.\n\nCert-issuer takes a JSON certificate and creates a hash, which is a short string used to uniquely identify a larger file of the certificate. The issuer issues a certificate by broadcasting a bitcoin transaction from the issuer’s address to a recipient’s address with the hash embedded in the OP_RETURN field.\n\nCert-viewer displays and verifies digital certificates after issuance. The viewer code gives the ability to users to request certificates and create a new bitcoin identity.\n\nCurrent Shortcomings\n\nThe team’s interest in designing new solutions is motivated by limitations in current approaches. Certification systems, when not working well, are not only inefficient due to an expensive and cumbersome process of requesting a university transcript. They can also be disastrous, like when a refugee cannot provide a certificate of completed study and therefore cannot continue their education. Digital systems can address such situations.\n\nIn the year the team has worked on the project, blockchain-based certification systems have gained a lot of attention.\n\nA key takeaway for the team has been that the blockchain is more complex than most people realize. Developing applications on top of it is getting easier, but there are few who deeply comprehend its inner workings. It is not a simple solution that can fix everything wrong with credentials. This is what the team is excited to explore.\n\nWhy Not Ethereum?\n\nWhen the project began, Ethereum was barely an idea, which explains why the team did not use it. In addition, bitcoin has been the most reliable and tested blockchain to date. And the robust self-interest of miners, along with investments in bitcoin, make it likely it will continue for a long time.\n\nThe team’s solution is not tied to a particular blockchain. The credentials can be published to other blockchains.\n\nFor most of what MIT is doing, the bitcoin blockchain continues to be efficient. The team is discussing the potential for Ethereum-based side chains to cut transaction cost and grow functionality.\n\nThe system uses public/private key pairs to authenticate both issuer and recipient. Certificate recipients, like workshop participants or graduates, could ideally create their own key pairs and share the public key to request a certificate.\n\nHowever, the scope of technical sophistication needed to accomplish this makes a widespread roll-out prohibitive.\n\nAt present, being able to share a simple link to a certificate is convenient. In the future, the team will want better ways for non-technical users to develop and manage their own keys.\n\nWallet Solution Ideal\n\nThe ideal solution would be a wallet for academic credentials that functions like bitcoin wallets. An alternative would be a paper-based system of sharing and pre-creating keys, then destroying them. This option requires a lot of trust in the issuing entity.\n\nThe team wanted to maintain the chance to revoke a certificate, in part because people are concerned about it, and because they worried they would miss a fundamental flaw in the design and have to invalidate initial attempts.\n\nRevoking version 1 is not a deletion since no information can be deleted from the blockchain. However, it is a flag that the issuer or the recipient can set to signal they don’t recognize the certificate as valid. The team creates two outputs containing 1 cent, with one output assigned to the issuer and the other to the recipient.\n\nTo revoke a certificate, one of the parties spends the output they control. In such a sense, it works like a convention that all users must agree on.\n\nThe viewer code follows the convention and checks to see if the revocation flag is set. Other viewers might choose to ignore it. This is a design choice the team is considering. For version 2, the team is exploring other revocation approaches that might cut the ability for viewers to validate or show revoked certificates.\n\nOne direction is “versioning,” following a chain of spends to the certificate’s most current version, which seems tedious. A revocation list, however, is a common pattern with other certificate issuers like X.509 certificates and open badges.\n\nCertificates can only be useful when tied to a person. Hence, protecting private data is critical.\n\nCertificates Must Be Useful\n\nLearners have to be able to show evidence they received a certain certificate. They should also be able to disclose the information to an employer without needing to share it with every other employer.\n\nSome MIT colleagues are working on solutions to provide more sophisticated ways to manage private data. Such initiatives are in early development.\n\nThe current solution attempts to balance obfuscation – making it difficult for unauthorized users to find the information they should not have access to – with usability so learners or institutions lacking advanced technical sophistication will not be prevented from using the credentials. This is accomplished by hashing the certificate – which has a learner’s personal data – and placing the hash on the blockchain.\n\nShould someone seek to verify the certificate, the learner has to disclose where the hash is located on the blockchain as well as the certificate itself.\n\nHow Much Control Should Learners Have?\n\nShould learners choose the aspects of their history to share with others? They can construct different narratives for different purposes with traditional certificates. Someone interested in writing and food can highlight certain experiences when seeking a particular job while highlighting another set of qualifications for another job.\n\nSome employers might seek stronger transparency requirements. In most cases, however, there is no reason to require the learner to share all accomplishments in the same way. Minus better safeguards to protect sharing of such information, the risks of requiring disclosure outweigh the benefits.\n\nSome individuals choose to broadcast their academic history while others do so only as needed. The MIT team wants to provide them similar flexibility in using digital credentials. It is possible for an employer to search the blockchain for other certificates the learner has, but the certificates’ content will be encrypted.\n\nAlso read: Engineering school simplifies verifying certificates using the blockchain\n\nDesign Has Shortcomings\n\nThe design has shortcomings. Should an issuer issue one type of certificate, it is possible to find all transactions the issuer made on the blockchain and determine who else might have received them. This is why the team is working on a technical change in version 2 – to make traceability more difficult.\n\nThe team sees a lot of potential in tracking the use of credentials to document value to the individual, but it does not yet have a clear design proposal. If there were a public record of degrees employers pay attention to, it would help students decide what programs to enroll in.\n\nThere are two solutions to extend the architecture, “transactional disclosure” and “disclosure by proxy.”\n\nTransactional disclosure deploys the certificate disclosing process as a transaction that is publicly recorded and generates data others can use. Disclosure by proxy relies on users verifying certificates via a third party that records the disclosures. The team is thinking about these options for version 2.\n\nVersion 2 On The Way\n\nThe team is focusing on deployment and documentation in version 2 to make it easier for other institutions to begin. The key technical change is the way the certificate data is stored.\n\nIn version 1, every certificate corresponds to a bitcoin blockchain transaction. In version 2, the team will store certificate data in a Merkle tree, which is a cryptographic construct allowing more efficient storage while preserving users’ ability to point to their certificates without having access to other certificates. The bitcoin blockchain will still record the Merkle root to maintain the benefits of using a blockchain.\n\nMerkle trees are more likely to be maintained by issuing entities than by recipients, but a wallet-based approach to managing credentials will still provide recipients full control over credentials.\n\nThe project home will be at http://certificates.media.mit.edu. There will be links to the source code, example implementations and documentation.\n\nThose experimenting in the space should consider joining the Github repository for the issuer functionality, cert-issuer. This is where the team plans to move most of the version 2 technical discussion. For bugs, project specific features requests and other issues, the team recommends opening a Github issue against the project or sending a pull request.\n\nFeatured image of MIT Lab from Flickr/ Knight Foundation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Federal Reserve’s Janet Yellen reportedly bolstered financial technology with her colleagues and a group of digital currency and blockchain advocates this past week. An event that took place in the Eccles Building had an audience of central banking authorities from 90 countries learning about fintech, Bitcoin, and blockchain.\n\nThe conference at the Federal Reserve in Washington called “Finance in Flux: The Technological Transformation of the Financial Sector,” had industry members from many firms within the fintech space including a keynote speech from the CEO of the blockchain-based company Chain. Adam Ludwin, the chief executive officer of Chain, gave the Federal Reserve’s Chair and her associates a description of distributed ledger technology and how it will transform banking today. According to Bloomberg he told the central bank attendees:\n\n“The real golden opportunity, the thing you should be working toward, is central bank digital currency, the development of the Internet and microprocessors had crucial government support. That’s where blockchain is today. At the infrastructure stage, it’s almost always the government that plays a leading role as the creator or backer of the technology.”\n\nIn a press statement from the Chamber of Digital Commerce Ludwin also stated that Blockchain technology would provide officials and central bankers new tools that will benefit the financial markets when it comes to safety. Financial institutions would “gain real-time transparency to measure systemic leverage and monitor compliance.” The Chain CEO also alluded to the central banks issuing digital currencies creating new payment networks with superior security, settlement time, and new innovative concepts.\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce founder Perianne Boring told the central banking audience the great attributes of blockchain technology as well during the event. Boring encouraged the attendees to focus on distributed ledgers and said, “we believe blockchain technologies are capable of providing the Fed and other regulators with next generation tools to fulfill their mission of monitoring the safety and soundness of the financial system more effectively,”\n\nBitcoin developer and CEO of Bloq Jeff Garzik met with the group of banking executives as well describing the many benefits of immutability and cryptography. Garzik told the crowd, “Some of the greatest potential benefits of blockchain technology are going to be first seen and actively leveraged in emerging nations.” The Chamber of Digital Commerce press release states the blockchain advocate group was pleased with the outcome, and senior officials showed a “high level of interest in blockchain technology.”\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is no stranger to Bitcoin as she has said in the past the central bank has no authority over the cryptocurrency. While testifying before the Senate Banking Committee Ms. Yellen stated, “The Federal Reserve simply does not have authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin in any way, this is a payment innovation that is taking place entirely outside the banking industry and to the best of my knowledge there is no intersection at all.” Last week’s event reportedly had the Federal Reserve official talking cryptocurrency again as well as distributed ledger technology. Perianne Boring told American Banker:\n\n“The fact that the words bitcoin and blockchain were spoken by Chairwoman Yellen in a positive context highlights the importance of emerging financial technology,”\n\nSource: Chamber of Digital Commerce, Bloomberg, and American Banker\n\nImages: Chamber of Digital Commerce, and Wiki Commons', 'Exponential Finance celebrates the incredible opportunity at the intersection of technology and finance. Watch live as hundreds of the world’s leading investors, entrepreneurs and innovators gather in New York to define the future of the way we do business.\n\nIn Bitcoin’s early years computer scientists and early adopters were running the show. Now, a new community of academics, entrepreneurs, and economists, are working with cryptocurrencies and blockchain to bring the technology to a new set of diverse applications.\n\nFrom building peer-to-peer networks for secure data computation and storage to decentralized content management systems that give patients access to health-care records across hospital databases, blockchain and digital currencies are starting to rewrite the rules of the 21st century transaction.\n\nBrian Forde, director of digital currency at MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative and former senior advisor for mobile and data innovation at the White House, is at the heart of this work. Forde believes that, in time, blockchain and digital currencies will impact society to the same degree the Internet has.\n\nForde says, “The Internet has exponentially increased the frequency of our communication, cryptocurrencies will exponentially increase the frequency of our transactions with others.”\n\nForde is particularly concerned with the implications of digital currencies in developing countries, where factors like costly third parties, proof of credit, and lack of credit card infrastructure block many from making basic financial transactions.\n\nForde is speaking this week at Singularity University’s Exponential Finance Summit, and in this interview, he explains how digital currencies could allow developing nations to “leapfrog” current tech infrastructure and shows where the technology stands and where it may be heading.\n\nWhat is a digital currency application that’s being developed at MIT (or external to MIT) that you’re most excited about?\n\nThere are a lot of great digital currency research projects being worked on at MIT. Three projects that we’ve publicly talked about are MedRec, Enigma, and academic digital certificates.\n\nMedRec is built on a private Ethereum network and is a decentralized content-management system for patients’ health-care data, which empowers patients to have access to their records across health-care providers. The average American has 16 doctors in their lifetime, which means you probably have 16 different healthcare records in siloed databases. This is a great example of how you might create a protocol to unify those records and share the combined data with your doctors or family members.\n\nEnigma is a peer-to-peer network being built by MIT students that uses secure, multi-party computation to enable different parties to jointly store and run computations on data while keeping the data completely private. This will enable developers to build “privacy by design,” end-to-end decentralized applications, without a trusted third party. This is a great example of how you can reap the benefits of sharing your data while maintaining your privacy.\n\nVerifying certificates (like university degrees) can be a slow, complicated, and unreliable process. A group in the MIT Media Lab is creating a digital infrastructure for certifications, Digital Certificates, in order to improve this burdensome analog process. This is a great example of how to quickly and digitally verify academic credentials for potential employers or for grad school applications.\n\nHow can digital currencies help developing nations “leapfrog” their current tech infrastructure over the next 10 years?\n\nMost developed nations have a strong network of credit card point of sale devices and relatively easy access to ATMs. In developing nations, credit and debit card infrastructure is less developed as is the issuance of cards.\n\nIf you think about it, it’s a bit ridiculous that two people with smartphones in their pockets have to take a piece of plastic out of their wallet, connect a dongle to their phone to transact, and then pay up to a 3.5% fee for the pleasure.\n\nHaving peer-to-peer transactions, free of dongles, free of plastic, with significantly lower transaction fees, and without the requirement of having a bank account deemed creditworthy, makes a lot more sense.\n\nThis can be done with smartphones or feature phones and smartphone adoption and cell coverage is increasing rapidly in developing countries.\n\nYou’ve compared the potential impact of blockchain to the impact that the Internet has had on society. For the global economy, what might it look like once the technology begins to disrupt traditional financial services and markets?\n\nSimilar to how the Internet has exponentially increased the frequency of our communication, cryptocurrencies will exponentially increase the frequency of our transactions with others because they enable peer-to-peer transactions without costly third parties.\n\nAn article in The Atlantic asks the question, “Is Bitcoin really the best way to think about establishing a digital commons for financial transactions?” What’s your stance on this? How can Bitcoin move past its early struggles?\n\nLike any emerging technology, there are an abundance of challenges that may impact the success of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These challenges include scalability, regulation, adoption, among others.\n\nEarly on, the people working on advancing bitcoin were mostly computer scientists and libertarians. Since then, the community has dramatically expanded to include a more diverse set of people drawing upon their unique set of experiences and developing new ways to use the technology.\n\nUltimately, we need to continue to increase the diversity of people working on cryptocurrencies while supporting the original folks who have an unparalleled understanding of the limits of the technology.\n\nThere’s a lot of media hype around security and privacy concerns with cryptocurrencies. What is a real one that we should be focusing on?\n\nIf a company’s website or database gets hacked we don’t say the Internet is insecure, we say the company who runs the website or database needs to improve their security.\n\nSimilarly, the bitcoin blockchain, for example, is the most secure blockchain in the world. When we hear about security breaches, similar to a company’s database being compromised, the cryptocurrency company needs to improve their security.\n\nMining bitcoin, which is kind of like payment processing and validation, secures the blockchain. The most important aspects to keep an eye on are the quantity, diversity, and compute power—or “hash rate”—of independent miners competing to do this every 10 minutes.\n\nThe greater the diversity, quantity and compute power, the lower the likelihood that the bitcoin blockchain ledger can be compromised. Muneeb Ali from Blockstack Labs wrote a good blog post asking whether Bitcoin is bigger than Google.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock', 'BITCOIN\n\nNo country, except for Russia, has explicitly said that it doesn’t want bitcoin. Until France, that is.\n\nA major right-wing political party has recently taken an aggressive stance towards virtually currency, announcing that it wants to ban all forms of cryptocurrency—including bitcoin—in the European country, should it get into power.\n\nIn a note published in late May, the Front National political party declared that virtual currencies should be considered a “serious threat” to the country’s “real economy.” Front National leader Marine Le Pen, who is expected to run in the 2017 French presidential election, accused world leaders and Wall Street power brokers of positioning bitcoin to create a world devoid of cash.\n\nShe wrote: “The powerful business lobby Wall Street banks (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs)… sold two ideas to states and institutions like the EU: virtual currencies or cryptocurrencies (the best known is the bitcoin and a cashless society.”\n\nMember of the Parliament Bernard Monot, who helped write the statement, told French media digital currencies—which came as “a result of capitalism running on its last legs”—are putting the traditional financial systems at risk.\n\n“Overthrowing the financial ecosystem is not the right way forward. Cryptocurrencies are an incentive for consumers to empty their bank accounts out of fear for negative interest rates,” Monot said, according to French national paper Le Figaro.\n\nMonot said virtual currencies are not meant to pay for a baguette—only to be played with, just like Monopoly money.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin is basking under the warm reception of many European countries, especially now that the European Union is considering revising the existing EU payments laws “in light of the new possibilities afforded by the new technological developments.” The Front National’s announcement might be the proverbial rain on digital currency’s parade—though the news shouldn’t come as a surprise particularly if we take into account the 2015 Paris attack in which hackers claimed the terrorists used bitcoin to fund the operation.\n\nThat being said, there’s still some time left before the 2017 French presidential election. Still plenty of time for the Front National to change its mind.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of bitcoin continues to its upward trend this week, hitting $581.88 on Wednesday with about 15.63 million bitcoins in circulation.\n\nComments', 'Bitcoin price has pulled out of its downward correction but is now in a twilight zone between the advance high and a potential trend breakdown.

If price continues lower, then the 1-hour 200MA (red) will be a target. This level was touched in some exchange charts, but not yet in the Bitstamp chart. Below it lies the $550 level where a Fib line should offer support.\n\nIf price forms another wave to the upside then the present move is unlikely corrective and we will most probably see another attempt on $600 (Bitstamp). The gray channel lines may delineate an ending diagonal move to $600, after which a correction to at least $550 (or lower) will unfold – if an ending diagonal is indeed the game.\n\nSlumping buy volume throughout 2016 remains a concern. It may pick up, however the overall impression of the frequently strained advance since February is that it is a base wave for the reward-halving advance – and not, yet, the reward-halving rally itself.\n\nSummary\n\nThe bitcoin price chart shows the market’s indecision. It is best to wait for either a breach of $600 (above which waits $680) or a break lower accompanied by sell signals in most timeframes. If the past several months’ labored price action has been a base wave for advance, then we can expect it to retrace 50%-90% of its height from $350.\n\nBitfinex Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin-price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

06/09/2016,"['As stakeholders in the world\'s largest decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) descend into forums to debate its future, concerns are emerging about what the success or failure of The DAO could mean for Ethereum, the blockchain platform that enabled its creation.\n\nFront and center for those invested is the idea that the fate of one of the technology\'s most visible projects could create a lasting impression among potential users and the public, and the fears are not without precedent.\n\nWhile bitcoin continues to face difficulty with regulators and banks, Ethereum has so far been able to build public bridges with the mainstream financial world. Tests were run by 11 banks on a private version of the network in January, and invitations for its creator to help inform the work ongoing at Hyperledger and R3CEV have so far followed suit.\n\nIn contrast, bitcoin\'s network has secured billions of dollars in funds for years, but its reputation was shaped early on by events like the shutdown of online black market Silk Road, the rapid price fluctuations of its token and the collapse of its once-largest exchange, Mt Gox.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, those close to the project are beginning to see The DAO as Ethereum’s ""flagship application"", one that they believe could hold the key to ensuring a lasting, favorable impression for Ethereum\'s technology, or scar its reputation.\n\nStephan Tual founder of Ethereum startup Slock.it which created the code on which The DAO is built told CoinDesk:\n\n""You don’t want a bad story about Ethereum. If [The DAO] were to crash, people would compare it to Mt Gox.""\n\nReality check\n\nBut why is so much riding on The DAO?\n\nA decentralized autonomous organization that lets its members vote on how to fund projects and direct operations, The DAO has so far amassed $160m in consumer funds in exchange for voting rights in the way it spends money, prompting mainstream media attention.\n\nCurrently, those funds amount to about 14.4% of all the ether in circulation and with a mandate to invest in Ethereum startups The DAO has the potential to exercise considerable influence on the ecosystem.\n\nBut shortly after the organization successfully raised the funds its design was challenged with the publication of a critical report authored by three computer scientists who specialize in blockchain. The report advocated for further development of The DAO to be halted until certain issues they claimed to have found in the governance model were fixed.\n\nOne possible mechanism to help solve those issues is built into the The DAO\'s voting mechanism. While the organization’s mission is to fund other Ethereum projects the method of selecting those projects can also be used to vote on internal changes, including to its own code.\n\nAt the moment, each of the top three proposals for funding from the DAO would redefine how it operates. The moratorium proposal is the most popular to date, followed by a proposal to change the deposit required to make a proposal and a method for returning DAO tokens accidentally sent to the project. Several others are specifically aimed at the governance model.\n\nBut, it\'s not just entrepreneurs who are concerned either. Six of the top 10 most discussed threads on The DAO forum pertain to changing The DAO itself, ranging from giving it a new name, to changing the requirements for submitting a proposal, and concerns about the way decisions are made.\n\nLearning from the Mt Gox implosion\n\nAt its peak, Mt Gox accounted for an estimated 80% of all bitcoin trading volume in the world.\n\nWhen the exchange collapsed in February 2014 losing an estimated $350m worth of bitcoin, many heralded it as one of the many so-called deaths of bitcoin. With a current market cap of over $9bn and a 20% price increase last month, bitcoin clearly hasn’t gone anywhere, but its reputation has visibly suffered.\n\nAt the time of the Mt Gox collapse, Tony Sakich was just getting started in the industry at his first job with a bitcoin company, BitPay. Now an Ethereum consultant with blockchain services firm Vanbex Group, Sakich told CoinDesk the reason bitcoin is thriving in spite of the collapse of its largest exchange is that so much activity existed in other areas of the bitcoin economy, a point he says the Ethereum community could learn from.\n\nTo help lead the development of the Ethereum ecosystem, investment firms which have traditionally focused on bitcoin startups — such as Blockchain Capital and Digital Currency Group — have recently begun evaluating Ethereum startups as potential portfolio members.\n\nIn April some of that research culminated in a $775,000 investment in Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood’s operation Ethcore, led by Blockchain Capital and Fenbushi Capital. Other firms such as Trust Stamp have also begun to receive VC investment.\n\nWhile The DAO is naturally attractive to Ethereum entrepreneurs looking for funding, Sakich said investments from outside the organization also need to increase.\n\n""I’m hoping that developers don’t hear all this about The DAO and stop there and think that’s their only way to get an Ethereum project done,"" Sakich said, adding:\n\n""To have a strong ecosystem in Ethereum you need projects outside of The DAO and there needs to be as many projects as possible.""\n\nDangers of parallelism\n\nWhile the Ethereum ecosystem appears to be growing into a resilient group of companies, there’s still danger of what blockchain consultant Taylor Gerring calls ""parallelism"" in the industry.\n\nGerring, who works closely with the non-profit Ethereum Foundation that helps support the network, told CoinDesk that the risks of another blockchain being tainted by a massive collapse early in its development remains a concern for the wider industry.\n\nIf The DAO were to collapse, he believes, the side-effects could go far beyond just having a negative impact on Ethereum, but might spill over into blockchain technology generally speaking.\n\nGerring told CoinDesk:\n\n""We should try to draw the comparison and try to ensure we’re not making the same mistakes from the past. If we make the same mistakes we could end up in a situation where there’s negative implications to all blockchains.""\n\nThat said, Tual noted that he sees differences in the architecture of The DAO and Mt Gox that could lead to different results, even in the case of a project failure.\n\nShould The DAO invest solely in firms that go bankrupt, Tual argued the project will have made a positive impact on the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nUnlike Mt Gox, which resulted in the loss of customer funds and years-long legal disputes, a total collapse of The DAO, he argued, would leave for its legacy the jobs it created and this industry-wide dialogue.\n\nBreaking the Mt Gox precedent\n\nYet, to keep The DAO from capsizing, Tual said he thinks members need to accomplish three objectives – rounding out its list of curators, amending its governance model to see after the concerns of voting members and investing in sound business ideas.\n\n""Obviously, choosing a winner is never easy. [But The DAO is] not a crowd of people, it’s a crowd of experts,"" said Tual. ""These are smart guys, they aren’t sheep.""\n\nTo help see to the governance issues Tual said the team at Slock.it has begun work on a proposal framework that would act as a ""stopgap solution"" to prevent an entirely new version of The DAO code from forming so early in its development.\n\nUnder the terms of the new proposal, voters would have a right to remove themselves from The DAO after a project is passed, but before it is formally implemented. In that situation members would hold onto dividends to be paid out from previous measures in which they were involved.\n\nWith the person or people who formally launched The DAO using Slock.it’s open-source software still unknown, Tual and his fellow co-founders have become the public faces standing in for who members of the forum call DAOtoshi Nakamoto.\n\nFor his part, Tual said critics of The DAO need to also recognize that with this much money on the line projects will move slowly. But he adds that the critics themselves are very welcome.\n\n""If you look at the criticism it stems out of concern because they want it to work,"" said Tual, adding:\n\n""We all want Ethereum to be a success and we all know a failed DAO would be bad.""\n\nImage via YouTube\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The company further said that Luyitong paid roughly ¥1bn (approximately $152m) in cash, and issued 81 million shares at an average price per share of ¥24.57 ($3.74), representing an additional ¥1.99bn (roughly $303m).\n\nCanaan said that its strong sales projections fueled the valuation, and that it anticipates a net profit of $27m for 2016, with expectations of $39m and $53m in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\nBig numbers aside, the deal isn’t yet complete.\n\nThough both sides have signed an acquisition agreement according to Canaan, the Chinese government still has to greenlight the purchase as it involves a domestic firm with a publicly listed stock. Canaan said that while it expects the deal to go through, regulators in the country will have the final say over whether the purchase will pass review.\n\nIf approved, Canaan will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Luyitong, and all current staff members would continue working for the firm, including founder and CEO NG Zhang.\n\nZhang told CoinDesk:\n\n""This deal is a vote of confidence in the three years of products and services we invented and released. From the first FPGA-based hardware the Icarus and Lancelot, continuing to the Avalon6 blockchain hardware miners, this acquisition and investment provides us the necessary resources and autonomy to make even better products and innovations that our customers expect.""\n\nOne of several companies worldwide to work on an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for bitcoin mining, Canaan’s Avalon was the first consumer-grade mining product to hit the market. Bitcoin mining is a process by which entities compete to validate transactions and add blocks to the bitcoin blockchain in exchange for a 25 BTC reward.\n\nHowever, the sale comes amid a time of transition for the bitcoin mining industry ahead of an upcoming decline in the network subsidy paid to miners, which is expected to fall from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC sometime in July.\n\nIn recent weeks, KnCMiner had a less successful end to its operations ahead of this transition, filing for bankruptcy, and many industry observers believe more volatility in this industry sector lies ahead.\n\nCoinDesk will continue to follow this developing story.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Thirty-six percent of respondents with 250 and 500 employees, and 57% with between 501 and 1,000 employees, indicated that they had bought bitcoins for possible ransomware events.\n\nLarger companies appear to be less willing to actually stockpile bitcoin for this purpose. Eighteen percent of businesses that employ more than 2,000 people said they had taken a similar approach to the issue, though 35% told Citrix and Censuswide that they’d be willing to pay a data ransom if required.\n\nDespite the small sample size – only 250 specialists within the UK were surveyed – the results suggest that at least some companies are preparing for the worst.\n\nMeanwhile, ransomware events continue to make headlines.

The group represents the blockchain industry and is the world’s largest trade association in the space.\n\nThis year’s gathering specifically focused on financial technology or fintech and with the aptly titled event “Finance in Flux: The Technological Transformation of the Financial Sector.” The theme of this year’s conference was on bitcoin’s underlying technology – blockchain and the FinTech sector.\n\nWhile the event was closed to the press, the CDC, in a press release, revealed that Janet Yellen, the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Fed Reserve, urged her fellow central bankers to study new innovation in the financial industry.\n\nNotably, she mentioned bitcoin and blockchain specifically as innovations that needed to be understood by central banks. Stating that the global financial system had undeniably benefited from fintech, she encouraged central banks to ‘do all they can to learn about financial innovations including bitcoin, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies,’ the press release revealed.\n\nYellen has, in a stance that benefits bitcoin and blockchain innovation, stated that the Fed Reserve does not have the authority to regulate the cryptocurrency. At a hearing in Congress in early 2014, an event that was streamed live to a worldwide audience, Yellen stated:\n\nBitcoin is a payment innovation that’s taking place outside the banking industry. To the best of my knowledge there’s no intersection at all, in any way, between Bitcoin and banks that the Federal Reserve has the ability to supervise and regulate. So the fed doesn’t have authority to supervise or regulate Bitcoin in anyway.\n\nIn a statement included in the CDC press release of the recently concluded event, Bitcoin Core Developer and Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik added:\n\nSome of the greatest potential benefits of blockchain technology are going to be first seen actively leveraged in emerging nations.\n\nWhile addressing the assembled group of central bankers, he reportedly spoke about the characteristics of blockchain technology. Ironically, the features he discussed included decentralization while talking to central bankers, cryptography, immutability, trust shifting and other features.\n\nCDC Founder and President Perianne Boring joined Yellen in urging the Federal Reserve and other central banks to embrace blockchain technology.\n\nShe outlined the reason in a statement that said:\n\nWe believe blockchain technologies are capable of providing the Fed and other regulators with next generation tools to fulfill their mission of monitoring the safety and soundness of the financial system more effectively.\n\nFeatured image from Wikimedia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price might be in for a larger drop based on the short-term reversal formation but technical indicators are giving a different signal.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price seems to be having trouble sustaining its climb, as it started forming lower highs so far this week.\n\nA head and shoulders pattern seems to be forming, indicating a potential reversal if price breaks below the neckline around $570.\n\nIf that happens, bitcoin price could drop to the next visible support around $540.\n\nBitcoin price might be in for a larger drop based on the short-term reversal formation but technical indicators are giving a different signal.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is still to the upside. This suggests that the rising support level around $570 might serve as a floor, especially since it lines up with the 200 SMA dynamic support.\n\nRSI is pointing up and might be ready to head north so bitcoin price could follow suit. Stochastic is indicating oversold conditions so sellers might need to take it easy from here and allow buyers to take control. If so, bitcoin could head back to the latest highs at $595.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe weak NFP report has weighed on the US dollar at the start of June, leading traders to price in lower odds of Fed tightening this month or the next. However, the safe-haven currency has managed to regain ground at the start of this week, possibly as risk-off vibes have remained in the financial markets.\n\nFor one, the looming EU referendum could have traders flocking to other fiat currencies such as the US dollar and away from European currencies. Still, other investors might be more interested to move their funds to alternative assets like bitcoin and other virtual currencies, which are not influenced by monetary authorities.\n\nIn addition, downbeat CPI results from China could once again spur speculations of yuan devaluation and drive more Chinese investors towards bitcoin. Recall that these factors were one of the main reasons for the sharp surge in bitcoin in late May. The FOMC statement next week could be crucial for determining dollar direction and therefore bitcoin price action so be on the lookout for potential breakouts or rallies.\n\nCharts from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Just recently the company implemented the DAO’s native token to the wallets application and also presented the first multi-functioning Ethereum/Bitcoin wallet for iOS devices the week before. Now the company has just announced integration with Coinbase directly within the app itself.\n\nCurrently, Jaxx developers are working on integrating Coinbase’s “Buy Widget” into the Jaxx user interface allowing the purchase of cryptocurrency as “convenient and painless as possible.” Decentral explains that online exchanges offer digital currency purchases for users but often there can be long waits and “friction points” along the way. This includes banking routing numbers, registration, and other tedious aspects. With Jaxx, the process will be seamless and allow users to get instant gratification by increasing their holdings within an easy to use interface. Decentral’s announcement states:\n\n“In recognition of the fact that the space requires new, faster and more convenient ways for users to purchase cryptocurrency with cash, we’re excited to give the community a sneak peek at our planned integration of Coinbase’s “Buy Widget” directly within Jaxx.”\n\nThe designs shown for the new feature are in its initial concepts and may look different with the end concept, but Decentral claims Jaxx developers are speedily working on the integration. Decentral says that Coinbase approached the Toronto-based company in regards to adding the buy feature. Coinbase affiliates told the company they were big fans of Jaxx, so the Decentral is working out the best approach to implementation for its growing user base. Decentral explains they are all about “increased collaboration between companies in the wallet space, and this is a particularly exciting prospect for us for that reason.”\n\nPartnering with the San Francisco-based exchange will allow Jaxx users within the United States to simply add a debit card number and purchase Bitcoin directly from the Jaxx wallet. The company has been told that Coinbase will be connecting additional coins to the buy feature in the near future. Decentral is working through the nitty-gritty of logistics and the user interface within the application such as “customizing the widget’s functions and design to match the current Jaxx aesthetic.” Alongside this, the firm is also researching purchase options for international users.\n\nDecentral looks forward to working with Coinbase and Shapeshift.io to allow anyone the ability to purchase Bitcoin easier and more fluidly. The integration with Coinbase will require a registrant’s name, email address, and debit card information but Decentral says all of this data is funneled through Coinbase’s end. Information is never stored by Jaxx and the business states they are committed to not holding funds or user information with the Jaxx application. Decentral wants everyone to use the wallet service and hopes to be the premiere portal for anyone’s digital currency needs.\n\nSource: Decentral\n\nImages: Decentral', ""Experimental male contraceptive project Vasalgel received a Bitcoin donation attempt valued at $13,000 last month.

A decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic currency and payment system all in one. It’s secure, enables anonymity, and is censorship resistant. One of its most disruptive features is that it passes control of currency away from government and central banks to individuals. We the people, are no longer dependent on governments and their central banks for our currency.\n\nBitcoin enables anonymity and avoids dependence on trusted third parties. However, the majority of Bitcoin based systems in place today, do not follow these same principals due to attempts at regulation and the lack of fully decentralized solutions.\n\nMany services allow you to buy and sell bitcoin, but they are regulated. These services enact money-laundering restrictions which require you to reveal your identity and record every one of your transactions. Bitcoin exchanges require your funds to flow into and out of exchange owned wallets, which require your trust and are frequently mismanaged – think of Mt.Gox. So while bitcoin is fully decentralized, most currently established bitcoin related services are fully centralized and designed to be trusted third parties. Effectively removing the intrinsic benefits of the Bitcoin system.\n\nI was excited to learn of Bitsquare, an open-source, peer-to-peer (P2P) application that allows anyone to buy and sell bitcoin in exchange to national (fiat) currencies or alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitsquare is unique in that it is fully decentralized and censorship resistant employing protection mechanisms such as:\n\n• escrow transactions employing 2-of-3 multi-signature addresses\n\n• security deposits to incentivize following the trade protocol\n\n• a decentralized arbitration system to help resolve disputes\n\nBitsquare protects individual privacy by using a custom P2P network over Tor, in which every user is a participating node. Bitsquare is a cross-platform application that runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows operating systems that provides an easy-to-use, intuitive user interface.\n\nBitsquare is a P2P bitcoin exchange. You can buy or sell bitcoin in exchange for other crypto-currencies or national (fiat) currencies. For example, ether, (the Ethereum crypto-currency) can be exchanged for bitcoin. If you want to buy ether, you sell bitcoin. If you want to sell ether, you buy bitcoin. Bitcoin is always on one side of a trade-able pair.\n\nMy primary interest is in trading crypto-currencies, and I was really excited to hear about the new Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model popularized by Ethereum. One really interesting aspect of the DAO model involves expanding this new digital economy, beyond just crypto-currencies, to include what I refer to as, cryptoequities.\n\nSince DAO tokens are similar to equity shares, I asked myself, why couldn’t we exchange DAO tokens for bitcoin using the Bitsquare application? So I contacted Manfred Karrer, the founder and lead developer of Bitsquare, and asked him if he could add The DAO and Maker DAO (MKR) tokens to Bitsquare for trading. This resulted in the release of Bitsquare version 0.4.8 that now supports crypto-currency and crypto-equity trading.\n\nI see this new DAO model as an improvement over the traditional organizational structures formed for investments purposes. How easy is it for someone in the USA to directly purchase common shares in a company based in another country? How many middlemen must one go through to do so? How many regulations exist that prevent you from doing so? Equity stakes through DAO tokens, provide a much more efficient and effective approach to equity investment on a global basis.\n\nI noticed a question in The DAO forums where an individual asked: if DAO tokens were held by an exchange, could the exchange vote those tokens on The DAO proposals rather than the individual who ultimately owns the tokens? This would not be an issue on Bitsquare because the trader/owner never transfers tokens to the exchange. Tokens are only transferred as a result of a change in ownership (the way it should be). Traders actually trade P2P on Bitsquare.\n\nThis is a first of it’s kind!\n\nSummary of Bitsquare benefits:\n\n• It’s free.\n\n• It’s secure.\n\n• It’s open source.\n\n• You don’t have to sign-up.\n\n• You don’t have to reveal your identity.\n\n• Your identity is protected on the network through Tor hidden services.\n\n• There is no transaction trail for anyone (including the IRS) to follow.\n\n• Trading fees are low.\n\n• You always maintain complete control of your funds.\n\n• It provides a fully distributed arbitration system for dispute resolution.\n\nBitsquare enables financial freedom and financial privacy for individuals on a global basis while significantly reducing counter-party risk. My hope is that Bitsquare will provide a fully decentralized reference model for others to imitate as they deliver crypto-asset related services.\n\nI encourage interested readers to visit the Bitsquare web site at https://bitsquare.io to learn more about the software, read the white-papers, interact with the community in the Bitsquare forum, download the free software, then start experiencing the real free market.\n\nAbout the Author: Crypto-currency entrepreneur and investor currently focused on Bitcoin, Sidechains, and Ethereum, Doug is a contributor to the Bitsquare project.\n\nEditor’s Note: This is a derivative work from an article of the same title by the same author, who kindly made few changes to the original article upon request to avoid duplication on the internet.

06/10/2016,"['The story behind the world\'s newest and potentially most powerful currency.\n\nEditor\'s note: This film is no longer available online. Scroll for our bitcoin timeline.\n\nFilmmaker: Nicholas Mross\n\nDaniel Mross is a computer programmer from Pittsburgh, who - along with balancing work, marriage, and raising three boys - spends much of his time involved in everything related to Bitcoin.\n\nWhen he discovered the crypto-currency in 2011, it opened up an uncharted world of new possibilities for him to explore.\n\n""It\'s fascinating to imagine what it means to have global decentralised money,"" he says.\n\nIn this two-part documentary, we go inside the complex world of Bitcoin to explore the social and political impact of an open-source digital currency and ask if it could create a monetary paradigm shift that will forever change the world.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin and who invented it?\n\nBitcoin, much like the internet in 1994, is not easily explained or understood. Its advocates compare the technical innovation with that of the World Wide Web. But while the internet changed the way people communicate, Bitcoin changes the way people view and use money.\n\nMy concern is how the governments will react. They can\'t kill or stop Bitcoin, but they could impede it and they could get in the way of its development. Erik Voorhees, Bitcoin entrepreneur Bitcoin was created to provide an alternative to the banking system. It is an open accounting system that allows thousands of computers from around the world to track ownership of digital tokens - the Bitcoin - as part of a purchase transaction. All transactions are visible to Bitcoin users and, once verified, are logged in a public ledger called the ""blockchain"". The ""blockchain"" records every Bitcoin transaction since the launch of the system and every user has a copy of the transactions. This is the primary difference between Bitcoin and the current finance banking system. While physical currency is issued through a central authoritative agency, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system. Bitcoins are awarded to ""miners"" - computers specialised in processing and verifying Bitcoin transactions - as a reward for their work. This is how new Bitcoins are released into circulation. Satoshi Nakamoto is the founder of Bitcoin. An online profile with a currently unconfirmed physical identity, Nakamoto first announced the development of the Bitcoin system in an online forum in late 2008. Despite his cryptic online presence, programmers and developers around the world immediately recognised the intelligence behind Nakamoto\'s peer-to-peer design, and worked with him to further develop Bitcoin. In October 2009, a first exchange rate was published, listing the value of 1,309 Bitcoins at $1. Bitcoins were cheap and throughout the following year they continued to trade for fractions of a cent. The first known transaction with Bitcoin occurred in 2010 when a Florida resident offered 10,000 Bitcoins to anyone who would order him a pizza. One user in London agreed, making a long-distance phone call to a Papa John\'s and cementing the first Bitcoin transaction in history. Bitcoin was gaining momentum, but in order for it to thrive, the coins needed to be more widely accessible. Tokyo-based Mt Gox was the first Bitcoin exchange on the market. By November 2010, four million Bitcoins had been mined. The exchange rate briefly spiked to 50 cents a coin. The market awoke and Bitcoin started to look as if it had real potential as a global currency. WATCH PART TWO:\n\nThe renegade currency Just a month later, the Bitcoin community received the attention it was looking for, albeit in all the wrong ways. As WikiLeaks released top secret US diplomatic cables to the world, and major financial institutions proceeded to block all transactions to WikiLeaks, one news article suggested that Bitcoin would be the perfect solution to the blocked donations.\n\nI don\'t know how the government will react to Bitcoin. But I spend thousands of dollars on lawyers every day just to make sure that I\'m not going to go to jail. Charlie Shrem, CEO BitInstant\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto slowly disappeared from all forums - and was never heard from again.\n\nJust months later, the Silk Road anonymous market was launched. This was an online black market dealing in highly illegal substances, including drugs and other illicit goods. Silk Road dealt exclusively in Bitcoin, taking advantage of the near impossibility of tracking transactions.\n\nThe Bitcoin exchange price continued to climb. By February 2011, it reached parity with the US dollar, sparking an influx of new users and speculators.\n\nIn June 2011, after hitting $31, Bitcoin exchange dropped dramatically. The Mt Gox system was hacked, driving the price even further into the ground. As the value of Bitcoin hit the $2 mark, speculators labelled it the end of the dream.\n\nBitcoin today and for the future\n\nIn 2012, after months of stagnation, hacks and online theft, Bitcoin slowly climbed its way back on to exchange market boards.\n\nBy 2013, recognised websites such as Reddit and WordPress announced Bitcoin as legitimate means for transactions.\n\nMonths later, as Cyprus suffered the biggest financial crisis in its history and banks withdrew money from account holders, Bitcoin thrived. Bitcoin ATMs were set up around the island, validating Bitcoin evangelicals\' faith in the currency.\n\nBut while Bitcoin seemingly ensures users\' privacy and offers a more democratic financial alternative to conventional banking, the same privacy offers anonymity to illegal activity - such as the Silk Road market.\n\nRegulators at the US Treasury have been wary about the possible dangers of Bitcoin, including possible funding of armed groups and money laundering - claims that are countered by many in the Bitcoin community and considered a means to control and suffocate the currency.\n\nSo, will Bitcoin weather the storm or fall victim to the ""system""?\n\nTIMELINE: The rise and rise of bitcoin\n\nSource: Al Jazeera', ""Toronto-based Bitcoin consultancy and software development company Decentral has announced the integration of its Jaxx line of blockchain wallets with digital currency exchange platform ShapeShift.io.\n\nThe integration of ShapeShift with Jaxx wallets will enable users to convert between bitcoin, ether and DAO tokens directly within the Jaxx wallet. It will also support any tokens that Jaxx and ShapeShift integrate in the future.\n\n“Jaxx and ShapeShift together will, without doubt, be the easiest solution for buying ether with bitcoin (and vice versa) ? and it’s done right in your Jaxx wallet!” said Anthony Di Iorio, CEO and founder of Jaxx and Decentral.\n\nAccording to Erik Voorhees, founder and CEO of ShapeShift, ShapeShift’s API was designed with the purpose of making cross-cryptocurrency conversions easier.\n\n“We built ShapeShift's API for this very reason — to enable other services in this ecosystem to leverage it for the benefit of their users,” Voorhees said. Converting blockchain assets should be as easy as clicking a button, and Jaxx's integration of ShapeShift demonstrates this principle.”\n\nHow It Works\n\nExplaining how the process works in a blog post, Di Iorio said that to start a conversion users first need to select their Bitcoin wallet and open the “send” tab, select the ShapeShift icon and enter the bitcoin amount they would like to shift, then confirm the transaction. Ether will show up in their Ethereum wallet when the transaction is completed.\n\nThe process for buying bitcoin with ether or DAO is the same. Users just need to start with their Ethereum or DAO wallet instead. The Jaxx wallet also displays the current conversion rate and minimum/maximum deposit amounts for the shift.\n\n“This method is far simpler than going to the ShapeShift site, as you don’t need to enter deposit or return addresses. It all gets automatically done in Jaxx using your built-in Bitcoin and Ether wallets,” Di Iorio said.\n\nSpeaking on the partnership with ShapeShift, Di Iorio said that the integration of ShapeShift’s API with the Jaxx wallet will help the company in realizing its vision of becoming the industry’s default blockchain wallet.\n\n“The Jaxx\xad ShapeShift integration is one of many partnerships we anticipate with companies around the world,” Di Iorio said. “We believe our single code base and the ability to deploy in minutes across all platforms and devices gives us a huge advantage towards becoming the industry’s default blockchain wallet.”\n\nAs of now, interoperable versions of Jaxx are available on nine major platforms. The company also recently announced a preview of integrating Coinbase’s “Buy Widget” with Jaxx wallet to enable users to buy coins and tokens from the wallet itself."", 'Chinese bitcoin mining firm Canaan Creative (more commonly known by its brand Avalon), is being acquired for a reportedly princely sum of ¥3.06bn, approximately $466 million.\n\nIt makes for a notable business deal in the bitcoin mining industry, perhaps the most notable yet. Beijing-based Canaan Creative, known for its bitcoin mining chip brand Avalon is being acquired for a reported ¥3.06bn (approximately $466 million) in what clearly sets a milestone as the biggest acquisition in the industry to date.\n\nCanaan Creative will be acquired as a whole by electronics manufacturer Shandong Luyitong (LYT), in a cash and stock deal, according to rumors.\n\nN.G. Zhang, Founder and CEO of Canaan Creative confirmed the speculation on the firm’s website, stating:\n\nYes, it is true. Canaan is being acquired by LYT, an electronics company. This deal is a vote of confidence in the three years of products and services we invented and released. This acquisition and investment provides us the necessary resources and autonomy to make even better products and innovations that our customers expect.\n\nThe major acquisition comes during a time when the bitcoin block reward halving is fast approaching, an event which is now less than 40 days away.\n\nWhile details remain scarce, Zhang added that the 100-strong and “growing” team of employees at Beijing-based Canaan will continue to work on new products. This implies that Canaan’s staff will presumably remain with their jobs whilst acquired by LYT.\n\nWhile the Chinese bitcoin mining firm enjoys a new boost of investment and backing with its acquisition, other bitcoin miners haven’t been as fortunate, ahead of the halving. In anticipation of the halving event, Swedish bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner declared bankruptcy toward the end of May. The company had reportedly laid off workers and was in the process of winding down operations in the months leading up to the upcoming halving. The firm will close its mining operations by July 10th.\n\nEarlier in May, Israeli bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer Spondoolies-Tech also announced that it would shut down operations that month after payroll concerns amid a lack of interest from creditors. Notably, fierce competition by Chinese bitcoin hardware manufacturers was seen as the reason for Spondoolies-Tech’s curtain call.\n\nA representative for Canaan Creative was not immediately available for comment at the time of publishing. CCN will report on this story as more details emerge.\n\nFeatured image from Canaan.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It makes sense for both companies to venture into the Malaysian market, as there are plenty of opportunities to explore.\n\nMalaysia seems to be warming up to the concept of Bitcoin and Fintech as of late. Thanks to a new partnership between Bitspark and Vitaxel Group, Bitcoin remittance will be coming to the Malaysian market very soon.\n\nMost people active in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency will have heard the name Bitspark before. The company has been making a name for itself in the remittance sector by leveraging Bitcoin and blockchain technology.

Vitaxel Group is the parent company of the first MLM from South East Asia to focus on travel, entertainment, health, and lifestyle products. All of their offerings are available on an ecommerce platform, as well as its own shopping mall.\n\nIt makes sense for both companies to venture into the Malaysian market, as there are plenty of opportunities to explore. At the same time, Malaysia will only be the first of many stepping stones as this partnership seeks to tackle all South East Asia markets over the coming years. With the rise of mobile banking and smartphone usage, reducing costs in cross-border trade is well worth exploring.\n\nBitspark CEO George Harrap told the media:\n\n“We are delighted today to begin our cooperation with such a distinguished company as Vitaxel and who are a natural fit with their experience in the eCommerce and payments space already and are confident together we will be able to offer market leading services to both individuals and companies alike in Malaysia.”\n\nRemittance payments in Malaysia are becoming a big business opportunity. Over US$2bn in funds is transferred to Indonesia annually. However, there is always room for more effective technology, to deliver the best value to consumers. This is where Vitaxel Group comes into the picture, as they believe the collaboration with Bitspark will be a game changer.\n\nFurther discussions regarding this partnership will be conducted over the next few weeks, and more information will be made available in the future. Bringing the benefit of blockchain technology to remittance in Malaysia will be a challenge, but it is also an excellent opportunity for Bitcoin to gain more positive attention.\n\nSource: Finextra\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Who will be responsible for any financial losses?\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to key speakers John Jegutanis and George Papageorgiou at the 2nd Athens Summit - The Evolution of Commerce and the Digital Finance Forum 2016 about Blockchain and its contribution to the evolution of commerce.\n\nAdoption of Blockchain and Bitcoin in Cyprus and Greece\n\nJohn Jegutanis, Founder of Coinomi, caused a sensation with his speech at the 2nd Athens Summit - The Evolution of Commerce conference.\n\nHe gave a presentation about digital wallets and their principal codification (BIP32/BIP39/BIP44), since it is compatible with Coinomi and other wallets, after their analysis technology of transaction sequence where the chain created “blockchain”.\n\nJohn Jegutanis: There was the risk of the public to lose interest if more delve into technical details, such as proof-of-work of Bitcoin. Although the Bitcoin and his blockchain has pulled the attention because of his continuity from 2009 and significant price increase against the traditional currencies.The questions I received focused on the important issue of the legal framework and what might happen if there will be a problem in the cryptocurrency software. In the end who will be responsible of any financial loss.\n\nCT: The Greek government will inevitably attempt to pass parliamentary bills concerning the incorporation of digital payments systems. Can we expect similar bills for cryptocurrences?\n\nJJ: Mostly the economic model of cryptocurrency works backwards from the traditional way. The user controls the private keys of the his wallet. This is a headache for the credibility of the banking system, because it is easy for the user to lose money through carelessness or malicious programs, so we conclude that we need more education for the ordinary user in cryptocurrency. If it is to legislate the issue of cryptocurrency, it will have to do with the identification information (Know Your Customer - KYC), which will involve the exchange and the companies that manage the conversion of cryptocurrency to traditional currencies and remittances to them. Simple wallets like Bitcoin Core, Coinomi, Mycelium, Trezor, and others where the user has 100% control of the private key will be very difficult to control.\n\nCT: Would it be more wise to follow the example of Japan in the regulatory sector, or will we have to wait for the EU parliament in September to pass a bill for all EU members?\n\nJJ: Surely there must be some future movement, but requires the separation of service, it depends where you will have the money as a user, even in the exchange, but again if you want to submit account freeze, will do perhaps only at the exchange not possible to happen in personal wallet of the mobile or the computer of each user.\n\nCT: Do you think there is a real danger of account freezing of digital credit cards bearing the Visa or MasterCard brand?\n\nJJ: Yes there is such a risk, but only for the part of the conversion of cryptocurrency to traditional currency, as happened in Cyprus and Greece, any cryptocurrency will not be lowered. This is the main reason that makes banks to worry, because in the long term will remain outside of the game, if all citizens understand the power and ease enables the use of digital currency. This is a road that will be followed by banks with the use of technology to create their own digital chain system (Blockchain). And we as a company want to have some connection to our digital wallet with credit or debit card of a Greek bank in the near future.\n\nDigital revolution in Greece\n\nGeorge Papageorgiou, a Bitcoin expert and developer of the world's first university course on Decentralized Digital Currencies, by UNic, spoke about the digital changes in banks, insurance companies and the capital market in his presentation at Digital Finance Forum 2016.\n\nGeorge Papageorgiou: The Digital Finance Forum 2016 held on May 31 in Athens, proved once more the need for innovation and the opportunities that digitization can offer to incumbents. Unfortunately it became more apparent than ever, that these exact opportunities can swiftly change be commercial fulcrums for fintech startups that can create competitive advantages with less operational and regulatory costs, and more scalability.\n\nEveryone may be watching, but not everyone in Greece appears capable to act in the same pace as the disruptors, which habitually come from abroad, with the exception of very few cases (here's looking at oSeven.io and CodeBurrow).\n\nEven though every other speaker mentioned blockchain as a distant challenge in some capacity, they need to realize that this is not some Sci-Fi future, but it is actually changing the world as we speak, and in the increasingly globalized market, it is coming for them, whether they're ready or not.\n\nThe result usually is which the impact on society of Greece will have the digital revolution; if our country will be running last to incorporate these innovations could save not only the €1.4 billion per year as stated in the study of the Athens University of Economics in 2017, but multiples. This will have some benefit to the economy.\n\n- George Papageorgiou""]"
06/11/2016,"['With the price of bitcoin at 20-month highs, market observers are beginning to assert the digital currency\'s strength could be drawing the interest of new global traders.\n\nWith many market participants struggling to get returns from more traditional asset classes, investors are now being prompted to look at investments they would not have considered before, such as digital currency, they argue.\n\nAccording to Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment fund EAM, the price rally the digital currency enjoyed just weeks earlier can be attributed, in part, to investors\' thirst for yield.\n\nEnneking told CoinDesk:\n\n""People haven’t been making strong returns in any standard investment class for a while now. They are searching farther afield to find them.""\n\nElsewhere, Joe Lee, founder of derivatives trading platform Magnr, pointed to macroeconomic uncertainty, stating that it has led casual investors to begin exploring options outside the traditional currency and bond markets.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, bitcoin prices enjoyed a sharp rally early in the week, rising from an opening price of $538.14 on 3rd June to a 20-month high of $591.03 at 09:45 UTC on 4th June, the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals.\n\nThese price fluctuations took place amid highly bullish sentiment, as Whaleclub data reveals that the long-short ratio – as measured by position size – reached 88% and 87% on 3rd June and 4th June, respectively. Confidence, which refers to the percentage by which a particular day’s position sizes were larger than average, reached 69% and 61% on these two days.\n\nBitcoin by the numbers\n\nAs in recent weeks, the bitcoin markets provided ample volatility for traders.\n\nHours after surging to the highest point since August 2014, bitcoin prices fell to $563.15, a price reached at 17:15 on 4th June.\n\nThe digital currency then mounted a recovery, rising to $582.83 at 02:15 UTC on 5th June, according to additional BPI figures. Bitcoin prices experienced further gyrations throughout the week, once again breaking through $590 at 12:45 UTC on 7th June.\n\nHowever, the narrative that bitcoin is appealing to new traders hits a stumbling block with other aspects of the data.\n\nThese price fluctuations took place amid modest transaction volume, as market participants traded 9.42m BTC during the seven days through 12:45 UTC on 10th June, Bitcoinity data reveals. OKCoin was responsible for 5.13m, or 54.47% of transaction volume, while Huobi accounted for 3.23m, or 34.30%.\n\nThese weekly figures fell short of many weeks so far earlier this year, when bitcoin’s trading volume was roughly 30m.\n\nEther optimism\n\nOf course, the recent price movements have also taken place as attention is drawn to ether, the digital currency that appreciated more than 1,000% in Q1 of 2016.\n\nEther’s price movements were also relatively modest this week, however, as this digital currency appreciated 4% from an opening value of $13.83 to a closing value of $14.38 during the week, Poloniex figures reveal.\n\nThe digital currency rose to as much as $14.75, 6.65% higher than the opening price. Still, market participants traded $105m worth of ether during the week, which was light compared to weeks in May.\n\nGoing forward, the developments that helped drive bitcoin’s weekly gains could help create a very promising situation for both digital currencies, and the general lack of appealing investment opportunities could certainly help fuel greater demand.\n\nAt the same time investors are feeling more open to less traditional assets, digital currencies are being seen more and more as a ""strong investment class,"" Lee told CoinDesk.\n\nThis shift represents a sea change for some.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is ""approaching more widespread adoption,"" and some of its naysayers have been forced into hiding, Lee said.\n\nCharles L.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Blockchain technology could bring $20 trillion worth of capital into the world economy and help lift people out of poverty, according to a plan by economist Hernando de Soto and Peruvian presidential candidate Keilo Fujimori. Their videoconferenced presentation was one of many highlights of Sir Richard Branson’s second annual Blockchain Summit on Necker Island, which recently hosted 40 bitcoin “Illuminati,” according to Forbes.\n\nThe Forbes article was written by Laura Shin, the author of the eBook, “The Millennial Game Plan,” and co-author of “Money Hacks.” Shin attended the event, and disclosed that she owns a small amount of bitcoin.\n\nThis year’s gathering differed from last year’s in that the attendees included a diverse group ranging from authors, musicians, government officials, scientists and entrepreneurs. Last year’s inaugural event was more tech- and startup-focused.\n\nA Diverse Attendee List\n\nThe attendees included an aerospace engineer, a musician, a derivatives specialist, the founder of a Chinese fintech museum, and former Pentagon and CIA and Department of Homeland Security officials. Sponsors included MaiTai Global, a non-profit event organizers, and BitFury Group, a bitcoin blockchain services and chip manufacturing provider and miner.\n\nDe Soto has long advocated using the blockchain to provide land titles to allow people in certain countries to build credit from resources on their land. In Peru, a better-organized system for managing land titles would alleviate the poverty of people living in shantytowns, people who represent 70% of the country’s population. The poor have no running water since piping water requires knowing who is responsible for the water bill, which requires having a land title.\n\nAnother problem it would alleviate is the rapes that occur when women have to go to outdoor bathrooms at night since there is no electricity.\n\nDe Soto said people from 43 European political parties have asked him how his plan could help address the migration caused by terrorism. He noted people don’t realize ISIS protects poor peoples’ homes. He noted that technology can counter poverty and violence in a way people can understand.\n\nBusiness Mixed With Pleasure\n\nPrior to the presentation by De Soto and Fujimori, the summit attendees spent two and a half days snorkeling, kite surfing, watching tennis matches, attending a concert by technologist/cellist Zoe Keating, and dipping in the hot tub. There were also references to “blockchain babies” that referred to startups that came out of last year’s gathering, such as Bloq, the blockchain company started by Matt Roszak and Jeff Garzik.\n\nOne of the most engaging exchanges occurred when Jamie Smith, global chief communications officer at BitFury, challenged the group for ways to describe the blockchain. This was a fitting question given the diverse makeup of this year’s gathering.\n\nMuch of the conversation focused on spreading the technology’s passion beyond existing adherents.\n\nGlobal Blockchain Council Announced\n\nBitFury announced the Global Blockchain Council to help companies adopting blockchain technology by offering a forum for innovation and collaboration. The council will work with the Chamber of Digital Commerce. In April, the chamber announced the Global Blockchain Forum to guide global blockchain policy.\n\nChallenged to describe bitcoin blockchain security in two minutes, one entrepreneur got teased for using terms like “merkle trees” and “petahashes.”\n\nSmith asked attendees to describe blockchain in 30 seconds or less, drawing responses about “galaxy of computers,” “ledger” and the efficient and secure movement of assets. Respondents offered terms like “censorship resistance,” “freedom” and “trust.\n\nBlockchain Poetry\n\nA poem to explain blockchain went as follows: “In blockchain we trust, people trusting people, moving goods and services verifiably and reliably.” Karen McArthur, an attorney who advises Canadian venture capital firms, added: “From the bottom up.”\n\nMessaging issues came up for discussion, such as the appropriateness of explaining blockchain without mention bitcoin. Kathryn Haun, an assistant U.S. attorney and U.S. Department of Justice digital currency coordinator and Stanford Law School lecturer on digital currencies, advocated pointing out that criminals use all kinds of great technology, including the Internet, in addition to bitcoin.\n\nBill Tai, co-founder of MaiTai Global, discussed the trajectory of his career in the Sunday morning opening session. Noting five technology waves starting with chips, moving to PCs, the Internet, mobile interfaces and data science, he envisions a sixth wave of marketplaces enabling asset movement. He noted the need for technology layers to build upon blockchain code to develop interfaces equivalent to technologies that made the Internet ubiquitous.\n\nRegulatory Challenges Addressed\n\nVinny Lingham, co-founder of the blockchain-based technology company Civic, wondered about how to work with the government given how long it takes the government to act. The federal officials in attendance noted that the government is cultivating startups and said it is best for companies to start with ground-level managers who might benefit from blockchain in their own work.\n\nAlex Tapscott, co-author of “Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World,” described how blockchain can support financial inclusion. This led to a discussion on the cost of remittance services. One attendee said she pays $30 to send $100 to Jamaica.\n\nElizabeth Rossiello, CEO of BitPesa, the sub-Saharan African foreign exchange and payments company, said traditional remittance providers offer near monopolies in certain countries.\n\nAlso read: Bitland blockchain initiative seeks to create reliable land titles in Africa\n\nPersonal Empowerment\n\nBrian Forde, the MIT Media Lab director of digital currency, discussed how personally empowering the blockchain can be. He said people who rely on companies to manage property don’t actually control it. A resale site sold tickets to a Lakers game but took them back when Kobe Bryant announced it was his last game, raising the prices by 664%. A blockchain-based ticket resale site would have allowed the purchaser to remove the tickets from the site’s possession.\n\nDuring a fintech panel, a regulation debate ensued. Lingham said regulations are not needed for databases, a position that placed him at odds with regulators in the room.\n\nMarietje Schaake, a European Parliament member, said citizens cannot use blockchain identity to claim their pensions if a state does not recognize it.\n\nBlockchain As A Security Tool\n\nIn two security-focused panels, a lead prosecutor who investigated government agents who stole bitcoin during an investigation said the blockchain made it possible for her to do her investigating. She supported crowdsourcing for solving crimes using the blockchain and letting friendly hackers try to hack the bitcoin blockchain to improve its security.\n\nPanels about music featured a Skype session with Imogen Heap, a musician who launched Mycelia, a foundation for developing a database for music creators that utilizes micropayments. She wondered about the possibility of transactions being so frictionless that we would not have to think about money just as we never think about tap water.\n\nOne challenge to such a system would be determining who created the work, an attendee noted. A existing Sound Exchange that disburses royalties from digital performances to creators has millions left over annually since the organization can’t identify the rightful recipients.\n\nImages from Blockchain Summit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price continues slowly losing altitude below $580 (Bitstamp).

CoinTelegraph spoke with the company’s CEO Bobby Lee about their current projects and his vision of the company’s future.\n\nLeader in China Bitcoin Ecosystem\n\nBTCC was originally founded in China in 2011. In a period of five years it has succeeded in occupying a leading role in every segment of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Let’s take a quick look at how the steel was tempered.\n\nIn 2013, two years after being established, the company raised $5 million in Series A funding from Lightspeed China Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which made BTCC the first among Bitcoin Exchanges to acquire venture capital investment. In April 2014 BTCC introduced the first Bitcoin ATMs in China and a few months later it launched its own Bitcoin mining pool. In April 2016 BTCC announced that the mining pool was to be made available internationally.\n\nSuch a rapid expansion has allowed BTCC to become a Bitcoin company with the widest range of services to offer. The diversity of services and products provided by BTCC allows its customers from more than 100 countries to engage in all aspects of the digital currency spectrum in one integrated platform.\n\nBobby Lee said to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“We are proud to have come such a long way. But looking at it today, it seems such a short distance in the larger scale of things. We are also proud to have extended the property from offering exchange services to payment processing, wallet services, mining pool, and Blockchain engraving. We are the first Bitcoin exchange in China and will continue to expand globally, improving our services.”\n\nLaunch of Physical Bitcoins\n\nTo celebrate its fifth anniversary BTCC introduced a set of physical Bitcoins struck in pure titanium. The reverse side of each Five Bitcoin coin is inscribed with the words ‘FIVE’ in 21 major languages. The inscriptions are bound by a solid round line symbolizing the universality of Bitcoin.\n\nBobby Lee explained:\n\n“We made the Five Bitcoin coin to honor the trust and support that our customers have shown us over the past five years. We are now the longest-running Bitcoin exchange, and our longevity reflects the unwavering confidence people worldwide place in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.”\n\nBTCC’s COO, Samson Mow said:\n\n“The BTCC brand is now synonymous with global excellence in the provision of Bitcoin services. The Five Bitcoin reflects BTCC’s position as the most trustworthy Bitcoin company.”\n\nAll Roads Lead to Asia\n\nDiscussing the company’s biggest achievements and challenges on the way to success, CoinTelegraph was also interested in knowing more about the overall climate within the Bitcoin ecosystem in China. Apparently, the interest in Bitcoin is expanding and even though the acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment is still limited, there are numerous possibilities for it in terms of payments, investments and the exploration of other use-cases.\n\nThere is an opinion that Asia is by far the best place to set up a business within fintech, including the Bitcoin business. The relative simplicity of getting funding for a project and the friendliness of the regulatory framework certainly accelerates the establishment and development of businesses.\n\nBobby Lee shared his perspective with CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Asia provides a compelling logic point for Bitcoin companies. Obviously, the Bitcoin property is large in Asia, just as it is in the US and Europe. However, European and US regulation is much stricter. Countries like Japan and China have adopted regulation that is more appropriate for the development of Bitcoin businesses.”\n\nDigital Currencies to Replace Cash\n\nThe potential for cryptocurrencies is recognized by the authorities. Recently, the governor of The People’s Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, expressed his opinion that digital currencies will inevitably replace cash. But governments will regulate and control any digital currencies which are used as legal tender.\n\nThe PBOC has been researching Blockchain technology and digital currencies for quite some time. Besides the aforementioned, it has spent a lot of effort researching other technologies related to digital currencies, such as mobile payments, controllable cloud computing, cryptographic algorithms and secure chips. Through this research the PBOC seeks to optimize the technological framework for digital currency’s issuance and circulation, finding ways to predict and address the risks that may emerge during the circulation of the currency.\n\nZhou Xiaochuan shares his positive view on wider adoption of digital currencies:\n\n“History shows that currencies evolve as technologies and economies develop. Cash, which is the current version of currency, is low-tech. It is therefore inevitable that cash will be replaced by new products and new technologies that have greater security and lower costs.”\n\nZhou Xiaochuan is certain that the rapid development of the internet and global payment systems make it necessary to issue and circulate digital currency, and he believes that it would improve financial infrastructure, economic quality and efficiency.\n\nChina has the world's largest population and an enormous economy. According to PBOC’s governor, it might take years of co-existing before digital currency will eventually replace cash in China. However, it seems that the country stepped into the future much earlier than a number of other states where the development of digital currencies is hindered. Shouldn’t they learn from China?"", 'The revelations of the last four months surrounding Craig Steven Wright – who claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin – have shed perhaps a new light on the early beginnings of Bitcoin. When Wright first made his claims, he implicated his deceased friend David Kleiman as co-founder of Bitcoin.\n\nIf this is true, when paired with Hal Finney, then the two disabled men would have played an instrumental role in changing the future of banking systems – and, indeed – many systems that make up our way of life today.\n\nWhen Wired and Gizmodo first broke Wright’s identity, and his claims regarding the beginning of Bitcoin, the latter publication focused in on Kleiman, who has a litany of certifications in cyber-security.\n\nHe had suffered a motorcycle accident that left him handicapped. Oftentimes, when people tried to analyze the writing of Satoshi Nakamoto, they would note how it seemed, sometimes, the writing style changed. If Kleiman indeed played an early role, then two of the earliest Bitcoiner – he and Hal Finney – would have both been wheelchair-bound.\n\nAfter his accident, Kleinman’s dedication to computers grew, and he became an elite specialist. He contributed to many of the same mailing lists Satoshi Nakamoto did. While his friend’s doubt that Kleiman helped invent Bitcoin, they admit he certainly had the skills to do so.\n\nHal Finney, who lived far from Kleiman’s Palm Beach County residence in Los Angeles, California, received the first ever Bitcoin sent from Satoshi Nakamoto as a test. Long before receiving that, he was a respected figure in the cryptography community. He ran the first cryptographically secured anonymous mailer in the 1990s. Hal explained his situation on BitcoinTalk:\n\nWhen Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.\n\nFinney mined bitcoin with CPUs\n\nHe mined bitcoins with CPUs, when this was possible. After having mined several blocks, Hal turned the mining off, because the noise bothered him and it made his computer hot. In retrospect, Hal admits, he wishes he had kept it on, while acknowledging how lucky he was to be there at the beginning.\n\nDespite his disability, Finney looked at the bright side: “I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It’s very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I’m working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ‘Trusted Computing’, to harden Bitcoin wallets. It’s almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.”\n\nHal pondered bitcoin, even in its very earliest days:\n\nThinking about how to reduce CO2 emissions from a widespread Bitcoin implementation — halfin (@halfin) January 27, 2009\n\nAndy Greenberg interviewed Hal, this theory was largely put to rest. The interview was conducted the only way Hal could towards the end of his life: a raise of the eyes for yes, and a lowering for no.\n\nGreenberg asked Hal if he was involved in the creation of bitcoins. With his eye movement, Hal says he was not. Greenberg reformulated the question:\n\nI sat next to Finney again and asked him if, in [the] sense of open-source contribution, he did consider himself one of the creators of Bitcoin. He raised his eyes and eyebrows. Then I asked him if he was proud of that work. Finney raised his eyes again, and he smiled.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Voilà une monnaie bien intrigante. Au début de 2013, elle s’échangeait à moins de 14$. Moins d’un an plus tard, le bitcoin s’approcha des 1000$. Comment ne pas laisser sa curiosité être piquée, lorsque l’on assiste à une croissance de 70 fois en aussi peu de temps?\n\nEn 2015, la dégringolade qui s’enclencha après le sommet atteint en 2014 se poursuivit. Le bitcoin s’effondra aux alentours de 215$, pour ensuite rebondir. Aujourd’hui, il s’échange à 585$. Avait-on affaire à une aubaine?\n\nL’Oracle d’Omaha, Warren Buffett, s’est déjà prononcé sur la question. En mars 2014, il ne mâcha pas ses mots lorsqu’il s’exprima ainsi dans les studios de CNBC : «Gardez vos distances! En gros, c’est un mirage!». Il expliqua que le bitcoin s’apparente aux autres modes de transmission d’argent, comme les chèques et les mandats-poste. Ces modes de paiement ne comportent aucune valeur en eux-mêmes. Par exemple, un chèque de 100$ permet de transférer 100$. Le chèque en question ne confère point une valeur additionnelle parce qu’il permet de déplacer des fonds d’un compte à un autre. Par conséquent, le bitcoin constitue un mode de transmission d’argent, qui peut et va être répliqué de différentes façons dans le futur. «L’idée qu’on lui attribue une quelconque valeur intrinsèque s’avère une farce selon moi», avait-il ajouté.\n\nNous partageons l’opinion de M. Buffett sur cette nouvelle devise, et hormis sa nature spéculative, nous y voyons peut-être un inconvénient non négligeable pour ceux qui l’acceptent comme mode de paiement en échange de produits ou services.\n\nUn inconvénient à considérer\n\nIl y a plusieurs années de cela, nous avions rencontré un individu qui nous présenta un système d’échange d’unités «troc», qui s’avérait fort populaire. Les inventeurs de ce système offraient aux commerçants et travailleurs autonomes de participer à ce réseau, moyennant le dépôt d’une certaine somme d’argent. Cette dernière leur permettait d’acheter des unités pour pouvoir commencer à effectuer des transactions. Les participants devaient également payer un frais mensuels pour couvrir les frais administratifs. Ces frais étaient évidemment prélevés en dollars, et non en unités. En outre, chaque transaction comportait un frais payable aux gestionnaires du réseau.\n\nLes participants espéraient accroître leur clientèle, et ainsi se faire connaître. Puis, en recevant des unités, ils pouvaient les dépenser chez d’autres participants. Tout le monde semblait y gagner. Toutefois, certains d’entre eux ont vite réalisé à quel point les ventes effectuées à l’intérieur du réseau pouvaient épuiser rapidement leurs liquidités. Prenons les restaurateurs comme exemple.\n\nVous possédez un restaurant, et vous vous enthousiasmez à l’idée d’assister à une hausse de la clientèle grâce à ce réseau. Après tout, si cela n’avait pas été de ce dernier, ces clients ne seraient jamais venus prendre un repas chez vous. Or, vous recevez 100% de vos revenus en unités, mais toutes vos dépenses doivent demeurer en dollars! Vos employés n’accepteront pas de recevoir des unités plutôt que de l’argent, vos fournisseurs non plus. C’est encore plus vrai avec le gouvernement : vos impôts doivent être réglés en argent «réel».\n\nDonc, ces restaurateurs se retrouvaient à «acheter» une quantité impressionnante de monnaie virtuelle. Si vos marges de profits sur vos dépenses variables s’élèvent à 40%, le 60% restant constitue l’équivalent d’un achat d’unités, comportant en plus un frais d’échange à payer. Le bitcoin, s’il n’est pas accepté par toutes les parties, pose le même genre de problème, sans toutefois le frais administratif. Si sa valeur croît ou demeure stable, on peut facilement le liquider. Dans le cas contraire, certains détenteurs développeront le réflexe de le conserver en espérant un rebond. À la longue, s'ils sont à cours de liquidités, ils devront le vendre à perte.\n\nBref, que vaut le bitcoin? Il vaut ce que les acheteurs sont prêts à payer pour l’acquérir. Étant dans l’impossibilité de deviner les intentions futures de ces acheteurs, nous préférons demeurer à l’écart.\n\nAu sujet des auteurs du blogue: Patrick Thénière et Rémy Morel sont analystes financiers et propriétaires de Barrage Capital, une firme montréalaise de gestion d'actifs. www.barragecapital.com"", 'TOKYO\n\nIl nome è brutto, il progetto molto interessante. «Mufg coin» (acronimo di Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Grop) promette di popolarizzare il ruolo delle monete virtuali nella transazioni finanziarie: sarà la nuova criptovaluta che Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ufj (di cui Mufg è la casa madre) si appresta a lanciare, prima per le transazioni bancarie interne e poi per i consumatori.\n\nSarà il primo grande gruppo finanziario a cavalcare un trend al quale ha fatto da battistrada Bitcoin, che proprio in Giappone ha prima trovato la maggiore piattaforma di sviluppo e poi una grave crisi di immagine. Con il crollo, due anni fa, della Borsa virtuale Mt.Gox, il cui capo, il francese Mark Karpeles, è stato incriminato. La principale banca giapponese sta puntando molte carte sul «FinTech», cercando di sviluppare prodotti e servizi che combinano finanza e information technology, come del resto stanno facendo varie istituzioni europee ed americane, sollecitate dal proliferare di start-up che rischiano di diventare seri concorrenti.\n\nUna differenza con Bitcoin è che il prezzo della criptovaluta Mufg non tenderà a essere volatile: una unità sarà convertibile in uno yen, commerciabile attraverso gli smartphone con una app riducendo le commissioni per una serie di transazioni. In fondo si tratta di una evoluzione delle carte elettroniche prepagate e ricaricabili di amplissima diffusione in Giappone, che però finora non consentono il trasferimento online di fondi. Un utente potrà, ad esempio, prelevare soldi dal suo conto bancario convertendoli in Mufg coins per poi trasferirli online ad altri: sarà più facile, ad esempio, dividere il conto per un pranzo tra amici. Meglio ancora sarà poter trasferire denaro virtuale e poi convertirlo in valuta estera all’arrivo all’aeroporto di un Paese straniero (evitando il latrocinio delle commissioni dei cambiavalute ordinari). Le fonti indicano che comunque Mufg coin arriverà solo nell’autunno del 2017.\n\nNel frattempo, secondo indiscrezioni, la People’s Bank of China sta lavorando a un piano simile. E non è detto che non arrivi prima.\n\n© RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA', '', 'Walmart Canada stores will stop accepting Visa cards as the credit card provider charges merchants “unacceptably high” fees, the retailer said on Saturday.\n\nWalmart has been unable to agree with Visa on an “acceptable fee,” and will no longer accept the company’s credit cards starting July 18, it said in a statement.\n\nThe move will not affect the U.S. stores of parent Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).\n\nA Visa (V) spokeswoman said in a statement it offers “one of the lowest rates available to any merchant in the country” and said Walmart Canada’s decision will have a negative impact on shoppers.\n\nRepresentatives of Walmart Canada and Visa declined to address questions on specifics of payment terms.\n\nA Walmart Canada spokesman said the retailer pays more than C$100 million ($78.27 million) in credit card fees every year, but specific transaction fees are part of “confidential agreements.”\n\nCanadian retailers have long complained about what they call the high interchange fees they pay credit card companies.\n\nIn 2014 Visa and MasterCard (MA) said they would trim Canadian transaction rates to an average effective rate of 1.5%, after complaints about their fees almost resulted in government intervention.\n\nUnlike American Express (AXP), which typically negotiates a flat fee with every merchant, Visa and MasterCard have variable fees based on the status of their different cards.\n\nSmall retailers, which usually have less power to negotiate transaction terms, have said that hurts them as they are never sure of the exact rate they will be billed between 1% and 3% on any given transaction.\n\nWalmart Canada said stores in Thunder Bay in the northwestern part of the Ontario province will be the first to stop accepting Visa cards, and the change will then be rolled out “in phases” to the rest of the more than 370 Canadian Walmart stores.', 'Schools must brace themselves for an onslaught of new cyber attacks. Today’s most pervasive cyber threat is “crypto-ransomware”, a type of malware that encrypts and scrambles files (usually in the form of confidential data) to hold them for ransom. As a recent victim of ransomware, Horry County Schools, the third largest school district in South Carolina, was forced to shut down more than 100 servers to stop the malware from spreading.\n\nThe devastating impact of ransomware leaves schools in a predicament. Once infected, organizations face two hard choices: spend multiple days offline attempting to recover the files, or pay the ransom. In the case of Horry County Schools, the data on 25 servers was rendered inaccessible and the school district had no choice but to pay the hackers $8,500 for the encryption key.\n\nWhile $8,500 may not be a significant amount to some organizations, it’s a hefty sum for educational institutions, where budgets are always a topic of discussion. With ransomware rapidly evolving, districts can only expect outbreaks to increase, both in frequency and cost of ransom.\n\nNetwork architectures leave schools vulnerable\n\nSchools are highly vulnerable to ransomware attacks. Because educational organizations typically share the same network architectures, they’re tied to the same network weaknesses that offer hackers economies of scale. Schools often place public computers (like library and classroom workstations) on the same networks as administrative computers, meaning that even an unsuspecting student could be the targeted victim.\n\nOnce infected, it’s easier for schools to experience the domino effect of ransomware, spreading from one computer to the next and ultimately locking down an entire district. More alarmingly, schools upgrade their systems less frequently than businesses and are less likely to keep their software up to date. Seeing as they are also less likely to have backups, hackers are well aware that these educational institutions will be more likely to cough up the ransom. But paying up is by no means the only option.\n\nSolidifying defenses and fighting back\n\nThe FBI often advises paying ransoms in crypto-ransomware cases, but giving into the demands of a cyber-criminal is often neither quick nor painless. Acquiring the Bitcoin currency in which hackers want to be paid can be difficult, and even then, paying the ransom is no guarantee of getting files back. Even if successful, the victim still needs to wipe and restore each of the infected computers to remove all traces of the virus, which results in even more downtime. But if an institution hasn’t been backing up its computers, paying will be the only option.\n\nWith backups in place, restoring from those backups can be a viable alternative to paying ransoms. But the restoration process can still be very time-consuming. A cloud backup provider, Carbonite, reports a restore rate of 10 Mbps, which means a 50 GB file archive would take around 12 hours to recover per affected endpoint.\n\nWith the right file management system in place, it’s possible to minimize the effects of ransomware attack from a major disaster to a mild disruption. Look for services that provide two key capabilities: First, look for systems that back up files in real time, and that allow users to easily and instantly roll back their files to any date and time, so as to easily restore files to their pre-infected state. Second, users need to be able to access their files from the cloud via unaffected alternate devices, even while IT is wiping and restoring the infected computer. Accessing corrupted files through other devices on the same network will only spread the malware. Having a system with these two capabilities in place before an attack will facilitate business continuity during a crypto-ransomware outbreak, and allow schools to continue to run smoothly without paying the hacker a dime.\n\nPutting ransomware in detention\n\nUnderstanding what actions to take immediately in the event of a ransomware attack is vital to stopping the outbreak. If a computer is discovered to have ransomware, it must be immediately isolated from the rest of the network. Since ransomware can easily extend to an entire network, it’s not only one staff member brought to a standstill but possibly the entire administration.\n\nIn short, much of an organization enters into a holding pattern while IT rebuilds the computers and restores their files from backup (if available). Even if they can access their files through alternate devices, the files themselves are encrypted and therefore unusable. The restoration process isn’t quick – arecent survey of nearly 300 IT experts showed that 72 percent of crypto-ransomware victims lost access to their files for at least two days, with 32 percent losing file access for five days or more.\n\nRansomware isn’t going anywhere and ransomware hackers have a “spray and pray business model” – meaning that organizations of all sizes as well as individuals are susceptible. It’s no longer a matter of if you’re going to get attacked, but when, it’s imperative for school districts to start the conversation on ransomware. They can implement the necessary technologies and practices to properly mitigate irreparable losses before they happen.\n\nJonathan Levine (@JonMLevine) is the CTO of Intermedia.']"
06/12/2016,"['Of all the rules in bitcoin\'s code, few are as revered as the hard limit of bitcoin production.\n\nThe code dictates that 21 million coins will be released over the course of bitcoin\'s lifecycle. By limiting the total amount of bitcoins that could be created, Satoshi Nakamoto was able to establish a defined amount of available data, a revolutionary accomplishment in and of itself.\n\nThe limited production of bitcoins was, in a way, aimed at counteracting the endless printing of paper currencies.\n\nNakamoto compared it to the discovery and mining of gold in the original Bitcoin white paper, writing:\n\n""By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.""\n\nBut in the actual code, there is actually no “constant of amount of new coin.”\n\nInstead, there are rules in place that dictate how much bitcoin will be released and when and how that supply is reduced overtime, ultimately leading to a time during which there will be no new bitcoins released.\n\nEach time a new block is added to the bitcoin network, freshly minted bitcoins are rewarded to whichever miner discovered the valid block. This reward, initially set to 50 BTC, fell to 25 BTC in late 2012. Sometime next month, this number is expected to fall to 12.5 BTC. This event is known as a ""halving"".\n\nBitcoin halving in the code\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin Core Client, main.cpp, the initial nSubsidy was 50 * COIN, which is the constant 100 million satoshis.\n\nIn the code, there is a line that says:\n\nConsensus.nSubsidyHalvingInterval = 210000;\n\nThis dictates that every 210,000 blocks, the amount of new coin released should suddenly cut in half. As the code runs, it continues to calculate how many blocks have been solved. When the number hits 210,000, the first halving event takes place.\n\nWhen the 210,000th block was hit, the number of bitcoin released was 50 * COIN divided by 2, which is 2.5 billion satoshi or 25 bitcoin.\n\nOn line 1574, the code specifies how the maximum number of bitcoin is reached. It says:\n\nIf (halvings >= 64)\n\nreturn 0;\n\nThis means that once there have been 64 halvings, there should be no further nSubsidy released. In other words, after 50 has been divided 64 times, the last bitcoin will have been released into the market and the total 21 million supply will be in circulation.\n\nUnlike with other perceived deflationary assets, it is crystal clear in the code that there will be a maximum number of bitcoin – and it is through this halving process that this state of affairs is achieved.\n\nBitcoin halving and miners\n\nMiners, as one can imagine, stand to be impacted the most when the next halving event takes place.\n\nIn the white paper, Satoshi explains that the addition of bitcoin comes at the expense of CPU time and electricity. Miners have special-purpose pieces of hardware that are constantly running in a bid to discover the next block, using a constant flow of electricity along the way.\n\nThey make money when the revenue generated through mining those bitcoins exceeds the cost of running the mine, which in addition to electricity also includes personnel overheard, insurance and any other charges that come along with powering a high-intensity data center.\n\nBut with the halving, miners stand to see their revenue fall by a commensurate amount, bringing with it a significant impact on their business.\n\nAccording to the CoinDesk Bitcoin USD Price Index, the price of bitcoin averaged $577 as of 12PM EST on 10th June. If the 420,000th block were to have been sealed with the market at that price, the amount of revenue denominated in US dollars that a miner could expect to receive would have fallen from $14,425 to $7,212.50 in an instant.\n\nLosing 50% of revenue could result in some bitcoin miners having to shut their operations down. At least one miner has moved to pull the plug ahead of the halving.\n\nHowever, there has been rigorous debate over how much of a concern the halving will be, given that the event is pre-programmed in the code and miners have likely been preparing for the event. Unlike with gold or another precious metal where a new, big discovery can happen at any time, miners know exactly what to expect and when.\n\nSome argue that miners don’t necessarily have to lose 50% of their revenue simply because their income is going to drop by half. As the argument goes, prevailing demand for bitcoins will stay constant, forcing the price higher once fewer bitcoins are being generated on a day-to-day basis.\n\nFor example, if miners were selling all 25 of their bitcoins per block to pay their bills, this would be an introduction of 25 new bitcoin into the market roughly every ten minutes (though this can fluctuate depending on network variance).\n\nIf the price were to stay constant at $577 even with these new bitcoins being added, that means there is $14,425 of available demand for every given block.\n\nIf the number of available bitcoin released every ten minutes were to fall by half to 12.5 BTC, the price of bitcoin will have to increase to make up for the $14,425 in available demand. Therefore, just because a miner sees its subsidy drop from 25 bitcoin to 12.5 doesn’t mean the revenue in USD will drop as well.\n\nHalving in the Real World\n\nFortunately, the bitcoin network has been through this situation before, albeit with a much smaller mining presence and less overall market activity.\n\nBitcoin experienced its first halving event on 28th November, 2012, the subsidy falling from 50 to 25 bitcoins per block.\n\nAt the time, the network hashrate was approximately 25,000 GH/s – a far cry from where it is today. A month later, the network hashrate dropped to approximately 20,000GH/s, a 20% drop. By February 2013, however, the hashrate had returned to its previous high and continued to rise from there.\n\nAt halving, the price for a bitcoin was approximately $12.25, which meant that miners received approximately $612.50 per sealed block. By February 2013, the price had actually increased to approximately $30. Miners had lost half of their bitcoin subsidy, but the price had increased enough to more than offset this. By April 2013, the price had increased to approximately $181.\n\nBut there is a big difference between a hashrate of 25,000GH/s, when the average person could run a bitcoin miner at home, and today, when industrial-grade mining farms in China, Iceland, the northwest US and the Republic of Georgia make up the bulk of mining activity seen today.\n\nToday, the network hashrate stands at 1.4 exahash at the time of this writing. For context, that is 1.4 billion gigahash per second. If July’s halving mirrored the last one, the hashrate could drop to approximately 1.12 exahash.\n\nFortunately, miners can look to litecoin for insight into what might occur at halving.\n\nThe hashrate right before Litecoin’s halving took place was approximately 1.19 TH/s. On August 25, 2015 Litecoin’s halving occurred. Over the next few days, the hashrate dropped from 1.19 TH/s to 1.11 TH/s.\n\nThe reality is that the hashrate only dropped by about 80 GH/s, which was only about a 7% drop.\n\nCharlie Lee, Director of Engineering at Coinbase and Litecoin’s Satoshi Nakamoto, offered the following theory as to why the hashrate didn’t really drop:\n\n""The hashrate dropped a little but then climbed back up pretty quickly to the previous level. That\'s really unexpected, but I think I have an explanation. I talked to some Chineses miners at Scaling Bitcoin and learned something interesting. Most miners have found electricity for free or close to 0 cost.""\n\nEssentially, because the cost of electricity was so low, miners didn’t see any reason to shut their hardware down that they had already paid for. In other words, while profit did drop, it was all profit at electricity rates.\n\nWith a significant percentage of mining taking place in locations that already provide cheap electricity, the outcome could be similar when the number of new bitcoins introduced falls: the hashrate may drop, but it might not be as significant a drop as it was the first time.\n\nThe exact impact on the network – and the price – remains to be seen, and the weeks leading up to the event will likely see no shortage of commentary and speculation as to the outcome.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The tone of the lawsuit makes it seem that the money manager was so confident in his investment at the time that he assured Darren McFadden, a running back for the Dallas Cowboys and rising star in professional American football, that:\n\n[Michael Vick] promised to pay back Plaintiff any funds that Plaintiff invested in such business venture. Instead, consistent with Plaintiffs recently-revealed pattern and practice Defendant Vick used Plaintiff’s fund to start this bitcoin “business”, including using all of Plaintiff’s monies to purchase all the necessary infrastructure and materials, only to retain all the revenues generated or derived from the “business” along with all the corresponding business assets purchased with Plaintiffs money.\n\nMichael Vick the financial manager should not be confused with the shamed dog-fighting Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, although they perhaps share a penchant for money making schemes which are less than honest.\n\nMcFadden recently came to the realization that the man he put in charge of “safeguarding his use of cash to protect his earnings” was in fact squandering it on pointless schemes, more than just the business of Bitcoin mining, which has been rocked by so more scandals than one article can possibly cover. In total, the Bitcoin operation, which is only vaguely referenced in the initial filing, only represents a fifth of the alleged $15 million which Vick is said to have burned. Due to the exhortations of the supposed white collar scam artist, McFadden was compelled in August, 2008 to vest the advisor with power of attorney over much of his assets, a move which essentially gave the manager unlimited authority where McFadden’s monies were concerned.\n\nOther failed investments were not specified, leading one to wonder if the use of the term “Bitcoin” is meant to herald its traditional negative connotation in a court environment. In any case, the complaint, filed in Pulaski County, Arkansas, outlines a con artist much more successful than most the Bitcoin world has yielded. Other businesses, besides the supposed Bitcoin mining operation, were all used to directly funnel money to Vick himself. One might conclude that the mining operation never actually existed, or worse the $3 million was invested into a “virtual mining” pyramid scheme such as the one Josh Garza is believed to have run in recent yearss.\n\nThe actual details of the mining venture will not be available until the case proceeds, and Michael Vick may decide to settle rather than work it out through the justice system, but it would seem a wise move on the part of Vick to convert a fair sum of his misbegotten gains to Bitcoin if he was sure his scheme would eventually be discovered.\n\nThe case cites Arkansas law which requires certain behavior from financial managers, advisors, and accountants, and alleges numerous counts of fraud, totaling a sum much greater than $15 million if a jury and judge are to decide. Vick could be paying McFadden for the rest of his life, but for McFadden and his attorneys, the case seems to be more about the dishonorable nature of Vick’s activities. McFadden says that Vick was a family friend, and the complaint states:\n\nAs a fiduciary, Defendant should be held liable for his conduct which did not meet the requisite standards of fair dealing, good faith, honesty, and loyalty and which constitutes self-dealing.\n\nRequest for comment was not returned by McFadden’s attorneys in time for publication, it being a weekend, but CCN will continue to inquire as to the precise nature of the alleged Bitcoin mining failure. It certainly is an increasingly unprofitable business, mining bitcoins, with difficulty at a near-all-time high on the currently (near) 1.7 million TH/s network. New financial technology is always a good place to hide impropriety, but Vick will be forced to prove in court (should he decide to fight rather than settle the case) that he sincerely believed in the investment, and then will still most likely be compelled to make McFadden whole for his financial injuries.\n\nFeatured image f\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""John Biggs is CEO of stealth bitcoin startup Freemit and a former editor at TechCrunch. His work has appeared in publications such as The New York Times, Gizmodo and Men's Health.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Freemit CEO John Biggs casts a critical eye on the current state of the FinTech industry today.\n\nWhat we’re experiencing in FinTech is a Cambrian explosion of personal and B2B financial apps and services. From wealth-advising robots to cheap equity trading platforms to mortgages in minutes, we are facing a world in which middlemen and women are being replaced by code.\n\nBut this code has creaky foundations. Zenefits was built upon – and was sued by – an old-guard payroll company. Many modern financial companies are still sending CSV files to central repositories using arbitrarily secure systems. Hackers stole $80 million from SWIFT – a platform that banks use to move money overseas – and were only caught because a human middleman noticed a spelling error.\n\nTalking to modern FinTech startups is like talking to the King of Swamp Castle.\n\n“When I first came here, this was all swamp,” they say. “Everyone said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built in all the same, just to show them. It sank into the swamp. So I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. And that's what you're going to get, lad, the strongest castle in all of England.”\n\nBut why do we have to keep building our castles on swamps?\n\n***\n\nConnecting modern apps to old foundations is a chump’s game. Forcing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to play nicely with established players in any real sense is a pipe dream akin to Linux on the desktop. Banks will let crypto in on their terms and as long as it benefits them directly. There is no fighting it, no matter how many ramparts you charge and flags you wave.\n\nThe answer, then, is to create new land. That is happening now, but in a very sneaky way.\n\nThe “it’s just a blockchain!” crowd have shut up for now because they’ve realized that appeasement doesn’t work. Ethereum, like Hansel, is so hot right now but no one outside of enthusiasts understand it.\n\nThen we have the die-hards. These big, Bitcoin-centric companies are shipping small ideas. We need to remember that 21 Inc, a company funded to the tune of $116 million, has released a single flagship product: a Raspberry Pi connected to a fan.\n\nWhat happened to moving heaven and earth to make Bitcoin real? What happened to the endless dream of a united, incorruptible currency? Did it die with hunt for Satoshi?\n\nEither the cryptocurrency industry – and not just the mass of enthusiasts – bands together to drain the swamps or finds new, solid lands on which to build. Either way, we’re at a standstill until this thinking changes.\n\nWe need fiat money to start behaving like bitcoin. We need these new FinTech apps to work across borders, for money to be “interoperable,” transactions to be fair and fast, and ensure that regulations are adhered to, globally. We are working on a way to connect FinTech apps together, to create a network. You can read our white paper here.\n\nBut we’re not alone. We’re one of several networks with the potential to bring about a true Internet of Value on new land: Stellar, Ripple, Ethereum, and of course Bitcoin, but the way we merge crypto with fiat is the key.\n\nWe have our own approach and we don’t know who or what is going to emerge as dominant. The paper is a description of what we intend to add to the global conversation. What we do know is that we’re experiencing three major trends at once – a multi-polar world, a FinTech app explosion and massive broadband/smart-phone penetration – and there is an opportunity to take advantage of them all, not just for the success of a company, but truly for the benefit of humanity.\n\nWe have to stop thinking like the King of Swamp Castle. Repetition while expecting a different result may have worked for the King, but it doesn’t work for businesses.\n\nThe entire industry needs to finally move off the swamp or else the entire industry will burn down, fall over and then, obviously, sink.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Rivalizálnak a bitcoin-appok fejleszt?i, s néhányan közülük egy új pénznemhez dezertáltak. Az Ethereum-alkalmazások lehet?vé teszik a kistermel?knek, hogy közvetlenül értékesítsék terményeiket a fogyasztóknak.\n\nVannak, akik úgy jellemzik az Ethereumot, mint Bitcoin 2.0. A hírek szerint harcok törtek ki azok között a szoftverfejleszt?k között, akik Bitcoin-alapú appokat terveznek, és ez lelassította a Bitcoin-tranzakciókat, néhányan pedig egyszer?en dezertáltak, hogy elkezdjenek egy más virtuális pénznemmel dolgozni. Az Ethereum, – pontosabban a mögötte álló szoftver, – ugyanis a szakért?k szerint többre képes, és hatékonyabban, mint a Bitcoin: online piacokat tud létrehozni és programozható tranzakciókat hajt végre, amiket “okos szerz?déseknek” is neveznek.\n\nA bitcoinnal ellentétben -melyet a titokzatos Satoshi Nakamoto indított el 2009-ben, az Ethereum transzparens módon keletkezett. A 21 éves orosz származású kanadai Vitalik Buterin alkotta meg miután otthagyta az ontariói Waterloo Universityt, s hét másik személlyel együtt írta meg a szoftverprogramot. A csapat 2014-ben 18 millió dollárt szerzett az Ethereum eladásával, a pénzb?l megalapították az Ethereum Foundationt, ami a szoftver fejlesztését segíti. A társalapítók egyike, Joseph Lubin Brooklynban m?ködteti a ConsenSys nev? céget, ahol 50 ember szorgoskodik az Ethereum fejlesztésén.\n\nAz Ethereumot létrehozó szándék az volt, hogy lehetséges legyen jogilag kötelez? érvény? megállapodásokat belesz?ni a Bitcoin-rendszerbe (amit egyébként meglep? dolgokra lehet használni.) Ez annyit tesz, hogy két ember például fogadhat egy sportmérk?zés kimenetelére, s ezt beprogramozhatják a rendszerbe, akárcsak a tétet, amit egyikük vagy másikuk megnyer. Azt is megállapítják el?re, hogy mely forrásból fogadják el a meccs eredményét. Ugyanakkor arra is jó szolgálatot tesz, hogy támogassa a helyi termelést: az egyik alkalmazás például lehet?vé teszi a mez?gazdák számára, hogy az internetre tegyék terményeiket és közvetlenül kereskedjenek a fogyasztókkal. Már most több tucatnyi app m?ködik Ethereummal, és így menedzselik az áramfogyasztást, a sportfogadást, s?t még piramisjátékokat is. habár a szakemberek szerint az Ethereumra több kibertámadás vár majd, mint ami eddig a bitcoint érte, mert szoftvere összetettebb, a nagyvállalatok mégis komolyan érdekl?dnek a technológia iránt.', 'Kurs bitcoina stale ro?nie. 50% w 2 tygodnie\n\nNastroje inwestorów na rynku stale rosn? a wraz z nimi kurs. Przez ostatnie 2 tygodnie kurs BTC zyska? ju? 50% osi?gaj?c cen? 650$ (na polskich gie?dach 2550z?). Rodzi si? teraz pytanie co dalej?\n\nTak jak pisali?my jeszcze w kwietniu, obecny intensywny wzrost nie powinien dziwi?. Dzieje si? tak zwykle po d?ugim okresie konsolidacji (tworz?cym na wykresie charakterystyczny trójk?t) na rynku i swoistym gromadzeniu energii, gdzie wystarczy jedna iskra, aby kurs eksplodowa?. Gwa?towny ruch kursu by? wi?c dosy? ?atwy do przewidzenia, kierunek zawsze przewidzie? ci??ej, jednak w tym przypadku wygra?o zdarzenie bardziej prawdopodobne. Kolejne ruchy kursu to ju? prawdziwa loteria.\n\nCzego mo?emy wi?c spodziewa? si? w najbli?szych dniach/tygodniach/miesi?cach?\n\nKorekta\n\nJak zawsze po du?ym wzro?cie kiedy? musi nadej?? jego korekta. Jest to zjawisko ca?kowicie naturalne i wynika z ogólnego wra?enia inwestorów o mo?liwym przewarto?ciowaniu kursu. Inwestorzy nie s? przyzwyczajeni jeszcze do takich poziomów cenowych, wielu skorzysta z okazji do sprzeda?y po nowym wysokim kursie. Jest te? zapewne wielu inwestorów, którzy licz? na jeszcze wy?sze poziomy wstrzymuj?c si? ze sprzeda??, a jeszcze inni dopiero zaczynaj? inwestowa?.\n\nTo jak g??boka b?dzie korekta zale?y od proporcji tych grup. Je?li liczba inwestorów licz?cych na wy?sze poziomy i nowych inwestorów jest du?a, korekta powinna by? do?? ?agodna. W przeciwnym wypadku mo?emy liczy? na g??bsz? korekt?. Trzeba pami?ta?, ?e korekta zawsze wyst?pi pr?dzej czy pó?niej, gdy? jest to zjawisko naturalne, jednak nigdy nie wiemy z jakiego poziomu. Mo?e to by? kwestia godzin, dni jak i tygodni.\n\nPo korekcie jak zwykle prawdopodobnie przyjdzie chwila na konsolidacj? kursu i przyzwyczajanie si? inwestorów do nowych poziomów cenowych. Je?eli dany poziom cenowy si? obroni i kurs na nim pozostanie, mo?na za?o?y?, ?e czekaj? nas kolejne wzrosty. W przeciwnym wypadku, chwilowy trend mo?e sie odwróci? i kurs zacznie systematycznie spada?.\n\nTrzeba równie? pami?ta?, ?e korekty dla kursu s? zdrowe pod warunkiem, ?e nie s? przesadnie g??bokie. Du?y i sta?y wzrost kursu, bez korekt zazwyczaj ko?czy si? tragedi?. Wyst?puje wtedy zjawisko p?kni?cia ba?ki.\n\nW tym przypadku i przy wzro?cie kursu o 50%, nale?y spodziewa? si? równie du?ej korekty, nie wiemy jednak kiedy i z jakiego poziomu si? zacznie.\n\nCo dalej?\n\nGdy korekta ostatnich wzrostów w ko?cu nadejdzie staniemy przed trudnym wyborem - co robi? dalej? Wiele b?dzie zale?a?o od g??boko?ci tej korekty. Je?li b?dzie p?ytka trend wzrostowy, który trwa od kilku miesi?cy prawdopodobnie dalej si? utrzyma. Je?li korekta b?dzie g??boka, obecny trend mo?e si? prze?ama?. Dalsze przewidywanie kursu jest w tej chwili naprawd? ci??kie. Portal Bitcoin.pl nie podejmie si? tego wyzwania, gdy? jego misj? nie jest przepowiadanie przysz?o?ci. Mo?emy jednak przeanalizowa? sytuacj? i przedstawi? wam pewne fakty, które mog? okaza? sie pomocne przy tworzeniu W?ASNEJ strategii.\n\nTrend\n\nOd stycznia 2015 roku, trend kursu ca?y czas pozostaje wzrostowy. Dodatkowo przebili?my ostatni szczyt z listopada 2015, co mo?e potwierdza? jego kontynuacj?.\n\nTrend d?ugoterminowy liczony od pocz?tku istnienia bitcoina równie? zostaje wzrostowy.\n\n\n\nJednak ?aden trend nie trwa wiecznie i kiedy? mo?e si? odwróci?, niekoniecznie teraz a w przysz?o?ci. O tym jak zwykle dowiemy si? po fakcie.\n\nPrzypominamy te? jedn? za najwa?niejszych zasad inwestorów: ""Z trendem si? nie walczy""\n\nBitcoinowe schematy\n\nBitcoin istnieje ju? od 7 lat, przez ten czas zauwa?y? mo?na by?o pewne schematy. Jak ka?da nowa i rewolucyjna technologia tak i Bitcoin podatny jest na ba?ki spekulacyjne. Ba?ki powtarzaj? si? okresowo i mog? si? powtarza?, a? do osi?gni?cia przez rynek odpowiednio du?ej masy. Du?a liczba inwestorów na rynku, wysoki kurs a co za tym idzie du?a kapitalizacja z czasem sprawi?, ?e du?e ruchy cenowe a co za tym idzie równie? ba?ki spekulacyjne b?d? zdarza?y si? coraz rzadziej lub wcale. Czy Bitcoin osi?gn?? juz wystarczaj?c? mas?, aby wykluczy? potencjaln? kolejna ba?k?? Pytanie zostawiamy czytelnikom.\n\nBitcoin w swojej historii mia? ju? 3 ba?ki spekulacyjne. Pierwsza 32$, druga 266$ i trzecia 1063$ (bitstamp). Wykres kursu z poszczególnych okresów ba?kowych jest do siebie tak zbli?ony, ?e mo?na nazwa? go pseudo-fraktalnym.\n\nZasada pozostaje niezmienna. Ba?ka ro?nie, potem p?ka, nast?pnie szybko pojawia si? korekta spadku a po niej d?uga fala spadkowa zako?czona do?kiem kursu. Nast?pnie przychodzi d?ugi czas konsolidacji kursu zako?czony du?ym ruchem cenowym i wszystko zaczyna si? od nowa. Obecnie jeste?my po d?ugim okresie konsolidacji po ostatniej ba?ce. Czy tym razem schemat znów si? powtórzy? Czy kurs pójdzie schematem powtarzaj?cym si? od lat? By?oby bardzo naiwnym my?le?, ?e zawsze tak b?dzie, ale nie wiemy te? kiedy schemat przestanie by? aktualny. Tu trzeba zachowa? szczególn? ostro?no??. Nie radzimy równie? inwestowa? swoich ?rodków wy??cznie na wierze w now? ba?k? spekulacyjn?!\n\nProblemy z przepustowo?ci? sieci\n\nGdyby okaza?o si?, ?e ba?ka jednak nast?pi i stanie si? to szybko, jest niemal pewne, ?e sie? zacznie si? zapycha?. Czy jest to du?y powód do zmartwie??\n\nZapychanie si? sieci, b?dzie skutkowa?o zwi?kszeniem prowizji za przelew. Nie oznacza to, ?e wszystkie transakcje b?d? potwierdza?y si? d?u?ej. Bardzo du?? cz??? transakcji w sieci stanowi? transakcje z bardzo ma?? prowizj? czy te? bez prowizji i takie transakcje, b?d? d?u?ej zatwierdzane. Przeci?tny u?ytkownik, który zap?aci sieci odpowiedni? prowizj?, prawdopodobnie nawet nie odczuje, ?e sie? jest zapchana.\n\nZapchanie si? sieci nie oznacza wi?c katastrofy pod warunkiem, ?e b?dzie to sytuacja tymczasowa. Ju? nied?ugo przepustowo?? sieci zwi?kszy si? o nawet 70-100% dzi?ki wprowadzanej w?a?nie zmianie - Segregated Witness. W tym momencie wszystkie transakcje wykorzystuj? ?rednio 60-90% przepustowo?ci sieci.\n\n\n\nBitcoin - inwestycja wysokiego ryzyka\n\nPami?tajmy, ?e mimo bardzo pozytywnych sygna?ów, trendu wzrostowego i wzrostu kursu, Bitcoin nadal jest inwestycj? wysokiego ryzyka. W jednej chwili mo?e zyska? 50% a w drugiej tyle straci?. Inwestuj wi?c m?drze i z g?ow?, nigdy nie przeznaczaj na inwestycje wszystkich ?rodków! Zawsze tylko tyle, ile mo?esz pozwoli? sobie straci?. Nie ulegaj zbiorowej euforii ani panice, my?l ch?odno bez emocji. Je?li zdecydujesz si? mimo wszystko zainwestowa? w Bitcoina, staraj si?, aby by?a to inwestycja d?ugoterminowa na lata. Je?li za? chcesz zarobi? szybko na wahaniach kursu, licz si? z powa?nym stratami. W ten sposób zarabiaj? tylko nieliczni, wi?kszo?? traci.

Sin embargo, hace referencia directa a OneCoin, un sistema de estafas piramidales que se hace pasar por una criptomoneda.\n\nEl Universal es uno de los diarios impresos de mayor circulación de México, actualmente está celebrando su año centenario y en el 2008 tuvo una refundación que lo llevó a expandir su difusión en Internet. Precisamente en su versión en línea, apareció el artículo con información de riesgo al cual hacemos referencia.\n\nEl artículo también ha sido replicado por otros medios en Internet, mencionando la llegada de OneCoin a Querétaro y las supuestas ventajas que supone el uso de esta “criptomoneda” o moneda digital.\n\nUn nuevo timo a la prensa no especializada\n\nNo es la primera vez que la prensa no especializada en Bitcoin y las criptomonedas publica información errada sobre la naturaleza, funcionamiento, uso y demás detalles sobre el tema. Sin embargo, nos llama la atención este caso puesto que se está promoviendo a OneCoin, un sistema de estafas piramidales ampliamente denunciado por la comunidad de criptomonedas en todo el mundo.\n\nSi bien El Universal de México ha publicado anteriormente información relacionada a Bitcoin y las criptomonedas, e incluso publicó un reportaje exclusivo en su edición impresa, ninguna entrega había supuesto un riesgo para la seguridad financiera de los lectores, tal como sí lo es en este caso donde se presenta a OneCoin como criptomoneda.\n\nDada la importante reputación que posee el diario en todo México y la vasta experiencia en periodismo de la institución, en CriptoNoticias preferimos inclinarnos a que el artículo no fue más que un engaño por parte de las personas interesadas en promover OneCoin, quienes han venido vendiendo este esquema fraudulento como una criptomoneda y utilizaron el alcance del diario El Universal para su promoción.\n\nAun así, en CriptoNoticias tenemos la responsabilidad de alertar a los usuarios, empresas y demás personas relacionadas de una u otra forma con Bitcoin y las criptomonedas, de la información dudosa y/o malintencionada que mucho se promueve en los medios para lograr estafar utilizando el nombre de criptomoneda.\n\nOneCoin, un sistema de estafas que crece peligrosamente\n\nOneCoin ya ha sido denunciada muchas veces y en muchos países por diversos medios de importancia del mundo de las criptomonedas, además está registrado en portales especializados en scams o estafas como Badbitcoin.org y las conversaciones en foros de Bitcoin y criptomonedas están repletas de testimonios de personas estafadas, alertas y denuncias.\n\nRecientemente la página de OneCoin en Wikipedia fue bloqueada para la edición, debido a que varios usuarios han querido remover la información negativa que le permitiría a la “criptomoneda” seguir dando una falsa apariencia de confiabilidad en la web. No obstante, a pesar de las numerosas denuncias y casos de estafas ya confirmados, OneCoin busca expandir su esquema fraudulento a lugares donde no ha sido conocido aún. Siendo Latinoamérica uno de estos lugares, es de suma importancia para el equipo de CriptoNoticias alertar a los lectores y desmentir la información engañosa al respecto.\n\nLos creadores de OneCoin han estado envueltos en distintos casos de estafas en el pasado. Su dueña y directora ejecutiva es la búlgara Ruja Ignatova, quien según la página oficial de OneCoin posee diversos grados académicos en leyes, administración y negocios; pero ninguno ha sido corroborado. Luego están Sebastien Greenwood y Nigel Allan, quienes estuvieron involucrados en las estafas de Unaico y Crypto888 respectivamente.\n\nJustamente el esquema piramidal de Unaico fue denunciado por las autoridades gubernamentales en Pakistán, llegándolo a calificar como un “sistema de mercadeo multi-nivel ilegal” y del cual publicaron una advertencia a la población de no participar y/o invertir en dicho esquema fraudulento.\n\nOneCoin no es una criptomoneda\n\nLas criptomonedas poseen muchas características técnicas que las califican como tal, siendo las principales la utilización de criptografía para la seguridad de los usuarios, algoritmos avanzados para la minería de las monedas, diversas casas de cambio que comercien las monedas y la existencia de un libro de acceso abierto a los usuarios donde se registran las transacciones. OneCoin no cumple con ninguno de estos requisitos.\n\nLos promotores de OneCoin se dedican a vender “paquetes financieros” donde a través de una inversión en dinero fiduciario los usuarios podrán recibir una cantidad determinada de monedas que podrán usar luego para comprar bienes y servicios, así como para fines de ahorro e inversión. Ninguna información oficial de OneCoin habla del proceso de minería de forma detallada, de la configuración de las carteras digitales o siquiera del registro abierto de transacciones realizadas por los tenedores de las monedas.\n\nAl usar la palabra “criptomoneda” e información de las nuevas tecnologías financieras, OneCoin se aprovecha para atraer a personas, convencerlas de invertir en el esquema y posteriormente estafarlas. Al mejor estilo de estos esquemas piramidales, los clientes son engañados al hacerles parecer que realmente reciben monedas digitales en sus carteras, lo cual les permite mantener la ilusión y la confianza en el proyecto.\n\nDe forma similar que otros esquemas de estafas piramidales -como MMM Global, LTCgear, etc- los usuarios son atraídos a ellos a través de promesas de jugosas ganancias, ventajas financieras y premios por el desempeño exitoso dentro de la plataforma. A pesar de que algunos casos los usuarios se les permite realizar retiros de las supuestas ganancias para seguir creando el ambiente de confianza, generalmente estos esquemas congelan los fondos de los usuarios una vez que han depositado fondos.\n\nLos usuarios siempre son siempre forzados a mantenerse en estos esquemas fraudulentos en los cuales el dinero invertido no puede ser retirado de forma rápida como sí ocurre con una criptomoneda real. Mas bien son engañados con excusas de políticas internas, limitaciones técnicas u otras; hasta que al final, cuando la estafa ha sido descubierta, los responsables desaparecen con el dinero de todas las personas que fueron estafadas.\n\nAlerta con las estafas en Latinoamérica\n\nEstos esquemas de estafas nacen y crecen en todo el mundo, pero a medida que van siendo descubiertos en algunos países los responsables trasladan su foco hacia lugares donde no son conocidos. Este es el caso de OneCoin, descubierto de forma plena en Europa y los Estados Unidos pero que ahora apunta hacia el mercado latinoamericano.\n\nSegún reflejan medios locales en Querétaro, los representantes de OneCoin se han reunido con miembros de la cámara de comercio local. Si bien este tipo de movimientos puede generar confianza a las personas para invertir en alguno de los paquetes financieros que ofrece OneCoin, en CriptoNoticias alertamos a los usuarios y les invitamos a revisar minuciosamente la información en Internet relacionada con esta supuesta criptomoneda.\n\nLa tecnología de Bitcoin sin duda alguna es innovadora y ya está cambiando la forma en que se mueve el dinero en el mundo. Además, al ser de código abierto, cualquier persona puede modificar el código y crear criptomonedas alternativas como ya ha sucedido con Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Lisk y muchas otras. No obstante este nuevo ecosistema se presta para que muchas personas malintencionadas lleguen a construir esquemas piramidales fraudulentos que sean vendidos como una nueva criptomoneda.\n\nEn CriptoNoticias nos enfocamos en difundir información confiable sobre Bitcoin, las criptomonedas y la tecnología blockchain; es por ello que presentamos esta alerta a los lectores no solo de México, sino de toda Latinoamérica para que se dediquen a investigar propiamente antes de invertir su dinero en dudosos esquemas financieros.', 'ADVERTISEMENTS\n\nShare with:\n\nLaura Shin from Forbes was lucky enough to land a writing gig at Richard Branson’s second annual Blockchain Summit on his private Caribbean hideaway Necker Island, and weaved some great coverage from the event.\n\nThe attendees included an aerospace engineer, a musician, a derivatives specialist, the founder of a Chinese fintech museum, and former Pentagon and CIA and Department of Homeland Security officials. Sponsors included MaiTai Global, a non-profit event organizers, and BitFury Group, a bitcoin blockchain services and chip manufacturing provider and miner.\n\nThe second annual Blockchain Summit — an event considered so exclusive that, as I noted in a previous story, some sources had joked that my attendance this year officially made me “Bitcoin illuminati” — was reaching its culmination. On Monday night, about 40 people were scattered on Balinese and Javanese teak and bamboo furniture in a room with soaring ceilings decked out with a bar, a pool table, bembe drums and ocean views on three sides. Golden light bathed everything, an easterly wind blew and seagulls glided above the water, but the gathering didn’t notice the setting sun from their tastefully appointed perch on Sir Richard Branson’s Necker Island. They were all fixated on a large screen, on which renowned Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto was presenting, via videoconference, a plan he and Peruvian presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori are proposing to help citizens title their property, such as land and automobiles. If such systems were rolled out worldwide, De Soto believes they would help bring $20 trillion of dead capital into the world economy and help lift people out of poverty globally. He told tales of how the lack of land titles or a well-organized system for managing them kept citizens in certain countries from building credit or profiting from, say, oil, gas and gold rights on the land. He said it has also contributed to 70% of the Peruvian population living in shantytowns without running water, because piping water in requires knowing who will pay the water bill — and that can’t be determined without a title. And, he added, the majority of rapes of women in shantytowns occur when they go to outdoor bathrooms in the dark of night because there is no electricity.\n\nBitFury announced the Global Blockchain Council to help companies adopting blockchain technology by offering a forum for innovation and collaboration. The council will work with the Chamber of Digital Commerce. In April, the chamber announced the Global Blockchain Forum to guide global blockchain policy.\n\nRead more of Shin’s great coverage from the event here.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPocket\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMore\n\nEmail\n\nGoogle\n\n\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\nSkype\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n', 'Die neue digitale Währungsplattform ermöglicht zuverlässige Fiat-Transfers über die Blockchain und dezentralisiertes Crowdfunding im Kickstarter-Style.\n\nPressemitteilung (WAVES):\n\nBitcoin und die hintergründige Blockchaintechnologie haben ein enormes Interesse im Finanzdienstleistungssektor und von Staaten geweckt, da diese die Vorteile des Archivierens von Informationen auf einer dezentralisierten Blockchain entdeckt haben. Jedoch hat bis heute der Bitcoin seinen absoluten Durchbruch nicht geschafft. Dies, obwohl Bitcoin optimal ist für das grenzenlose und kostengünstige Transferieren von Geld. Einer der Gründe für das Fehlschlagen ist die Volatilität: Der Bitcoin schwankt mehrere Prozentpunkte pro Tag in Wert, was ihn zu einem schlechten Instrument zur Wertaufbewahrung macht. Ausserdem erhöht dies die Einstiegsbarrieren zur Adoption, wie zum Beispiel im Markt der Geldüberweisungen, welcher USD 600 Milliarden gross ist. Bitcoins Status ausserhalb des Bankensystems hat Fragen aufgeworfen hinsichtlich Geldwäscherei und Kriminalität, was finanzielle Institutionen davon abschreckt, sich direkt mit ihm zu beschäftigen. Als Alternative beschäftigen sich diese Institutionen immer mehr mit geschlossenen, zentralisierten Blockchains, welche sicherlich Vorteile bieten, vermutlich aber nicht für die 2.5 Milliarde Menschen ohne Zugriff auf Bankenservices.\n\nBanking-Zugang, Transfers über die Blockchain\n\nWAVES hat einen anderen Ansatz gewählt als die meisten bereits bestehenden Plattformen. WAVES ist so aufgebaut, das es einerseits das Transferieren von Fiat-Währungen, wie USD, EUR, CNY und GBP, sowie andererseits das Überweisen von Kryptowährungen über die Blockchain ermöglicht. Tokens, welche diese Währungen auf der Blockchain darstellen, werden von vertrauenswürdigen Gateways, typischerweise Banken oder andere Finanzunternehmen, ausgegeben. Diese Tokens können anschliessend zwischen Nutzen, verteilt über die ganze Welt, transferiert werden. All dies schnell und zu günstigen Konditionen aufgrund der Effizienz der Blockchain. Durch die selben Gateways können die Tokens wieder in das traditionelle Bankensystem ausgezahlt werden.\n\nDieser Vorgang ermöglicht es Finanzorganisationen im Einklang mit den rechtlichen Anforderungen zu bleiben, da sie alleine verantwortlich sind für die Einhaltung von KYC und AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) Richtlinien. Trotzdem können sie die vollen Vorteile der Blockchain wie Geschwindigkeit, tiefe Kosten und Transparenz geniessen. Währenddessen können Endnutzer ihre Gelder transferieren ohne sich Gedanken über Volatilität zu machen und müssen ihre persönlichen Angaben nur bei einem Gateway hinterlegen, sollten sie ihr Geld von der Blockchain wegtransferieren wollen. Dies ist ein markanter Unterschied zu den bisherigen Ansätzen wie zum Beispiel Ripple: Nutzer müssen dort ihre KYC-Informationen einer zentralen Autoritätsstelle übermitteln, welche von der Plattform selbst betrieben wird.\n\nEine neue Art von Crowdfunding\n\nDie Möglichkeit, Fiat-Währungen über die Blockchain zu verschicken, öffnet das Tor zu dezentralisiertem Crowdfunding mit einer Serie von weiteren Vorteilen. Gelder können gesammelt werden mit der Option der automatischen Rückvergütung an Investoren sollte ein gewisses Minimum nicht erreicht werden. Dies komplett ohne einem einzelnen Administrator vertrauen zu müssen. Des Weiteren können die erworbenen Tokens, welche einen Anteil an einem Projekt darstellen, in einem sekundären Markt vor der Projektlancierung gehandelt werden. Dies erlaubt es Investoren, ihr Investment zu verkaufen sollte der Bedarf dazu da sein.\n\nDie WAVES Plattform selbst wurde durch einen solches Crowdfunding auf die Beine gestellt. Anstatt private Investoren zu suchen, zielte WAVES auf die breite Masse von Investoren ab. Rund 5‘800 Leute investierten ein Total von mehr als 29‘000 Bitcoins mit einem aktuellen Wert von über USD 15 Millionen um die Entwicklung und das Marketing zu finanzieren. 100 Millionen WAVES Tokens, der ‚Treibstoff‘ für die Plattform, wurden nach dem Crowdfunding an die Investoren verteilt. Da diese Tokens für jegliche Interaktion mit der Plattform gebraucht werden, hoffen Investoren von der steigenden Nachfrage in Folge Adoption zu profitieren. Weitere Features, welche im Verlauf dieses Jahres implementiert werden, sind eine dezentralisierte Asset Exchange (auf welcher Währungen gekauft und verkauft werden können) sowie ein Wahlsystem.\n\nÜber Mark Preuss Mark Preuss ist Gründer und Geschäftsführer von BTC-ECHO.\n\nNach seinem Wirtschaftsstudium in den Niederlanden und in China führten ihn verschiedene berufliche Stationen im Finanzwesen zunächst in die Schweiz und schließlich nach Düsseldorf.

06/13/2016,"['Anxieties about the unsustainable runup in Chinese corporate debt sparked a massive rally in bitcoin that sent the price of a single virtual coin to its highest level in more than two years.\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin broke above $700 on Monday for the first time since early February 2014, just before the failure of a prominent bitcoin exchange ignited a years-long selloff.\n\nBeginning around 5 p.m. Eastern on Saturday, bitcoin prices shot higher, rising from around $580 to more than $700 in trading midday U.S. time Monday.\n\nChinese buyers were behind the bulk of the rally, trading volumes show, with nearly 85% of transactions conducted in yuan, according to data from CryptoCompare.\n\nOne bitcoin recently traded hands at 4,756 yuan, according to CryptoCompare, a 1% premium to the price measured in dollars, at $714.\n\nCryptoCompare A chart showing bitcoin prices over the past three years.\n\nPeople who monitor trading in the cryptocurrency market said this most recent rally was sparked by comments from the International Monetary Fund’s No. 2 official about the systemic threat posed by China’s massive pile of corporate debt.\n\nDavid Lipton, IMF’s first deputy managing director, said during a conference in China on Saturday that the worsening corporate problem in the world’s second-largest economy needed to be dealt with urgently.\n\nThe IMF is set to conclude its yearly assessment of the country’s economy on Tuesday. Their analysis is expected to focus on the country’s debt issue.\n\nChina’s total debt of around 225% of gross domestic product isn’t particularly high by global standards, but its corporate debt pile, equivalent to 145% of GDP, is high, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAnxieties about China’s massive pile of risky corporate debt have escalated over the past year as Chinese officials slashed capital reserve ratios for the country’s banks. Doing so theoretically makes it easier for banks to lend and, thereby, boost declining economic growth rates.\n\nBy one measure, the country’s debt bubble is larger than the one that preceded the U.S. financial crisis.\n\nCharles Hayter, the chief executive of CryptoCompare, said some Chinese investors, anxious to protect their assets as the threat of an economic disaster, have sought succor in bitcoin.\n\n“Bitcoin fits the bill perfectly as a conduit to evade capital controls, and as a hedge against depreciation,” said Charles Hayter, the founder of CryptoCompare.\n\nBitcoin prices have been rising steadily since late last year. Over the past month, bitcoin prices have risen 51.5% in dollar terms, and 58% when measured in yuan, according to data provided by Cryptocompare.\n\nBitcoin prices haven’t been this strong since early February 2014, before Mt. Gox, one of the first and formerly one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, abruptly halted bitcoin withdrawals, blaming a bug in the bitcoin software that allowed for the manipulation of transaction data.\n\nThe firm eventually admitted it had been hacked, and that millions of customer bitcoins had been stolen. It quickly filed for bankruptcy, and investors’ claims to recover some of their lost coins are still working their way through Japanese bankruptcy courts.\n\nThe selloff that followed undid most of a speculative runup in bitcoin that occurred during October and November of 2013. Prices eventually peaked at an all-time high of $1,242 a coin in late November of that year.\n\nIn January 2015, nearly a year after the Mt. Gox troubles began, prices bottomed out at below $200 a coin, the weakest level since before the latest price runup began in late 2013.\n\nInvestors bid up bitcoin ahead of ‘the halving’\n\nInvestors are also bidding up the currency in anticipation of a phenomenon that will cut the digital currency’s rate of inflation in half, according to several market experts.\n\nThe event, which cryptocurrency enthusiasts call “the halving,” should happen in about 26 days, judging by the current rate at which bitcoin blocks are mined.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin miners — users who are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins for donating computer power to the network — receive 25 new bitcoins every time they successfully mine a new block. After the halving, that number will drop to 12.5.\n\nThe mechanism behind the halving was written into the bitcoin protocol to manage the supply of bitcoin over the long term.\n\n“This halving is basically the monetary policy of bitcoin,” said Erik Voorhees, chief executive of ShapeShift. “Everyone whose using this money knows what the money supply will be in four years or fifty years.”', 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York state’s financial regulator on Monday approved a license for bitcoin company Ripple Labs Inc, allowing it to offer digital currency services in the state.\n\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services said the company had cleared a review of anti-money laundering, capitalization, consumer protection, and cyber-security standards.\n\n“DFS is pleased to continue to foster the growth of the New York virtual currency marketplace,” Acting Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo said in a statement.\n\nBitcoin is a Web-based “cryptocurrency” that enables users to move money around the world quickly and anonymously without the need for third-party verification. Despite being championed by some as the digital money of the future, it is often dismissed as a currency that is too volatile to invest in.\n\nRipple’s service and currency, known as XRP, is for financial institutions and companies, such as banks, that provide liquidity for foreign exchanges.\n\nLast year, New York became the first U.S. state to issue extensive rules for virtual currency companies. The guidelines, aimed at consumer protection and prevention of money laundering, require companies to obtain what is known in the state as a “BitLicense.”\n\nRipple filed for the license under its corporate name, XRP II LLC, a venture backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures and IDG Capital Partners.', 'Hong Kong: Bitcoin surged to a two-year high amid expectations supply of the digital currency will shrink next month.\n\nThe cryptocurrency rallied to $696.5 on Monday in Hong Kong, the highest since February 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was trading at $689.23 as of 3:50 pm in Hong Kong, up 19% from Friday.\n\nProfits from mining bitcoins will be reduced in July, a process that’s written into the code to limit supply, according to Chinese exchanges OKCoin and Huobi. Increased attention from venture capitalists and banks on blockchain, the technology of digital ledgers, has boosted bitcoin’s legitimacy, Jack C. Liu, chief strategy officer at OKCoin, said in Hong Kong.\n\n“The halving of the supply of Bitcoin is attracting many retail investors,” Liu said. “More broadly, we continue to see follow-through from the blockchain hype cycle translating to interest in bitcoin the asset.”\n\nThe price of bitcoin has mostly recovered following a steep decline to less than $200 in January of last year from more than $1,000 in December 2013.\n\nBitcoin’s rebound is coinciding with weakness in the yuan, which fell the most in two months on Monday in Shanghai. Losses have accelerated in recent weeks as the dollar strengthened and China’s economic outlook deteriorated. Data on Monday showed industrial output rose 6% in May from a year earlier, while fixed-asset investment increased 9.6% in the first five months of 2016, missing all 38 economist forecasts.\n\nCapital outflows\n\n“What we’ve seen over the weekend is more of the same: Chinese fear of a slowing economy and the yuan potentially looking to make another move lower,” said Ryan Rabaglia, head of wholesale product management at ANX International in Hong Kong. “Each time we see yuan weakening we tend to see a triggering of capital outflows out of China, and bitcoin has been on the winning end of that.”\n\nThe yuan is trading near the five-year low it touched in January, while the Shanghai Composite Index is this year’s worst performer among 93 global stock measures. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned this month that the yuan weakness may trigger capital outflows and increase bets on a one-off devaluation.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2008 under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, a programmer or a group of programmers, and does not operate through a central bank. Rather a network of volunteers validate transactions via their computers, which require encrypted electronic signatures, and in return earn fees based on market prices.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2016, venture capital investment in startups commercializing blockchain reached $1.1 billion, according to industry researcher CoinDesk. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission officially classified bitcoin as a commodity in 2015.\n\n“The halving of production has fueled expectations of supply reduction,” said Li Lin, founder of Huobi. “Use of bitcoin has become more common among the public, giving its development a more favourable social environment.” Bloomberg', 'Bitcoin has broken $700!\n\nThe digital currency has gone on a wild streak over the weekend, peaking above $700 on Monday, and is currently hovering around that point — $700.58 as of writing.\n\n(All figures come via bitcoin news site CoinDesk\'s price analysis tool.)\n\nIn the space of a month, bitcoin\'s value has jumped by more than 30% — from around $450 (£317.38) in mid-May to the $700 mark it is hovering around today.\n\nThis is the highest bitcoin\'s price has been in around two years — it last broke the $700 mark back in February 2014, when it was trending downwards following all-time highs of more than $1,100.\n\nBitcoin is infamously volatile. This time last year, it was just a third of its current value, around $230. But it has slowly regained value since, gathering pace over the last few weeks.\n\nThe price surge comes ahead of a ""halvening"" or ""halving"" later this month . This is a reduction in the amount of bitcoins produced by mining — the process whereby computers dedicate processing power towards creating new bitcoin. When it hits, the amount of bitcoin being introduced in a set time period will halve. As you\'d expect when supply is about to be constrained, the price is spiking.\n\nPrevious recent surges have also been driven by Chinese investors as the yuan at a time of a weak yuan.\n\nHere\'s the price of bitcoin over the last month:\n\nAnd here is the price of bitcoin since its inception:', 'Bitcoin startup 21 Inc announced it had open-sourced its software this weekend, a move that finds it following through on statements by the firm\'s co-founder and CEO, Balaji Srinivasan, at CoinDesk\'s Consensus event last month.\n\nThe release coincides with a stronger presentation of the company\'s long-term vision, one that will find it seeking to enable micropayments via APIs services for developers as part of a broader transition it calls the \'third web\'.\n\nThis terminology, the company argues, helps articulate the transition from the World Wide Web of documents and hyperlinks, to the social web, to one where economics are now involved because of bitcoin.\n\nThe company wrote:\n\n""You couldn’t really have had a Machine-Payable Web before bitcoin, because the ability of a machine to possess, send and receive currency autonomously depends critically on the nature of bitcoin private keys as bearer instruments.""\n\nAs we reported in May, the software can be used to connect any device to the 21 network and 21 Marketplace, capabilities that were previously only available to owners of the 21 Bitcoin Computer.\n\nAfter installing 21\'s software, users can get bitcoin on any device in ""almost any country"" without a bank account or credit card, build micropayments into apps, and earn bitcoin with HTTP requests, the company states.\n\nThe third web\n\n21 also continued to emphasize how its products could be used, which follows its recent trend of releasing proofs-of-concept that help contextualize its vision.\n\nIn the new blog, 21 Inc suggests that the machine-payable web would enable people to, say, avoid irksome paywalls and manually entering credit card details by clicking a link and automatically sending some digital currency.\n\nThus, the firm says, bitcoin is ""uniquely suited"" for handling machine-to-machine payments, allowing developers to access paid web services ""as easily as they link to new websites"".\n\nA quick guide to the new software package can be found on 21 Inc\'s website.\n\nNodes visualization via 21 Inc\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The ASX is investing in it. Politicians have talked it up.\n\nYou may not have heard of it, but earlier this month representatives from the worlds of politics and finance (including a member of European Parliament and the US Justice Department\'s digital currency coordinator) met on Richard Branson\'s private island in the British Virgin Islands to discuss its revolutionary potential.\n\nThe revolutionary potential of what exactly?\n\nBlockchain. It\'s the technology that bitcoin uses to facilitate transactions. Whether or not bitcoin ultimately succeeds as a currency, there\'s a lot of excitement that the architecture underpinning it could completely transform the way we do banking, cyber security and even democracy.\n\nYou still haven\'t told me what it is…\n\nBlockchain was invented at the same time as bitcoin — in 2008 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, who may or may not be Australian.\n\nIt\'s basically the register of all bitcoin transactions, like a bank ledger.\n\nWhen you make a transaction using traditional money, bank ledgers are updated to reflect where the money has come from and where it\'s gone. Similarly, when you spend a bitcoin (or a fraction of one), the blockchain is updated to reflect this.\n\nBut there are a few innovations that differentiate the blockchain.\n\nTo prevent abuse of the system, all bitcoin transactions need to be confirmed by the peer-to-peer bitcoin network before they can go ahead; and once a transaction has been verified, through a secure cryptographic process, it\'s added to the blockchain in a process that can\'t be reversed.\n\nWhat\'s more, there\'s only one blockchain, and it\'s public — meaning every transaction ever made is visible to everyone.\n\nSo, no double-spending, no need for a bank to act as a middleman on transactions, and it\'s all transparent.\n\nAnd this is important why?\n\nFinancial commentator John Lanchester, writing for the London Review of Books, says blockchain technology could change just about everything when it comes to money:\n\nA decentralised, anonymous, self-verifying and completely reliable register of this sort is the biggest potential change to the money system since the Medici. It\'s banking without banks, and money without money.\n\nIt\'s this idea of ""banking without banks"" that has naturally got the interest of … banks.\n\nIf blockchain poses a threat to banks, why are they so excited about it?\n\nThat\'s the great irony. Bitcoin found a way to eliminate the role of banks in transactions. But now these same banks want to use blockchain technology to beef up security and make their processes more efficient.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank is one of dozens around the world currently experimenting with the technology via the firm R3.\n\nLate last year, the bank\'s chief information officer David Whiteing said:\n\nBlockchain has the potential to transform banking in the way that the internet transformed how we buy music and watch movies.\n\nReserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens is watching the blockchain project with interest, telling the Australian Financial Review that he thinks it\'s ""the really clever bit"" of bitcoin.\n\nThe shadow minister for financial services, Jim Chalmers, is also on board, saying:\n\nThere\'s little doubt that blockchain will have huge implications for the way we transact in the digital economy.\n\nThe potential doesn\'t end with banking, either: it\'s been suggested that blockchain could be used for collecting taxes, issuing passports, registering land, and selling shares (the ASX is already an investor in blockchain).\n\nWhat was that you said about democracy before?\n\nSome enthusiasts think blockchain could even be a game changer when it comes to elections.\n\nThe dilemma for online voting has always been this: how do you protect the privacy of individual voters while also ensuring (and proving) that the overall outcome is correct?\n\nDevelopers and entrepreneurs — including a start-up from Perth — are looking to blockchain to help find a solution.\n\nBut Dr Vanessa Teague, an expert in this field from the University of Melbourne, says we shouldn\'t count on them having any success.\n\nFirstly, she points out that blockchain isn\'t invulnerable from attack. That\'s because the integrity of blockchain is contingent on the computational power behind it being distributed. So if you had enough computational power, you could alter the results.\n\nDr Teague says that\'s a big problem:\n\nThink about the financial resources devoted to winning even an Australian election. Are you really sure that similar resources couldn\'t upset the blockchain ledger?\n\nShe points out that:\n\nyou can already use a cryptographic voting system without using blockchain\n\nmany of the problems with online voting have nothing to do with the type of ledger used, like how to ensure there hasn\'t been coercion at the voter\'s end, and how to authenticate voters in the first place.\n\nSo while you can expect to see blockchain technology used at your bank, it looks like it\'s not about to replace the ballot box.\n\nTopics: business-economics-and-finance, banking, internet-technology, science-and-technology, australia\n\nFirst posted', 'Akin Fernandez is the owner of bitcoin voucher service Azteco and an active technology blogger going under the nickname \'Beautyon\'.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Fernandez offers a critique of a presentation given last week at the US Federal Reserve to an audience of 90 central bankers, and explains why he believes the event didn\'t properly represent the technology.\n\nAround 100 central bankers and regulators from around the world came to the Federal Reserve (the organization that inadvertently caused the creation of bitcoin) last week in Washington, DC, for an event titled ""Finance in Flux: The Technological Transformation of the Financial Sector"".\n\nJointly hosted by the IMF and World Bank (two organizations participating in the global fiat money Ponzi scheme), the event shows bitcoin is no longer regarded with any doubt by people at the top of democracy. Everyone who was saying that it works completely as described is now 100% vindicated, and all the people who said it did not work are humiliated.\n\nWhat these bank men are doing is reacting to this clear and present threat to their role as monetary intermediaries. Blockchain startup Chain wants to be the vendor of choice for the software providing the middleman services to these central banks, and CEO Adam Ludwin made a sales pitch at the event without explicitly asking: ""Who is going to write this software for you?""\n\nAs I have said before, you cannot have blockchain without bitcoin, and this article by professor Saifedean Ammous, published in the prestigious American Banker, expounds this fact nicely.\n\nMen who try and separate blockchain from bitcoin are inevitably software vendors desperately trying to sell their services, trying to separate the inseparable because they can’t come up with business models where they interact directly with bitcoin. They also tend to be statists with a fervent belief in the absolute authority of government and implicit legitimacy of the money it mandates everyone accept in payment.\n\nThese people have a problem explaining this software plainly, and sometimes they just make things up. Talking about ""blockchain architectures"" could actually be a codeword for ""MySQL"". Everything that these vendors offer can be done in a MySQL database centrally controlled and secured with GPG. I have described how this would work in a previous essay.\n\nWhat these vendors are leveraging is computer illiteracy. It\'s a safe bet that none of the attendees listening to this talk understood a single software concept that was presented to them; they were there merely to represent their organizations.\n\nAgainst the state, not for the state\n\nThe perspective Ludwin gives in his talk is misleading and troubling.\n\nThe true background story of bitcoin is a deep dissatisfaction with the fiat currency system that steals money from the poor, fuels war and destroys economies. It is the state and its fraudulent money that was the sole driving force behind the creation of bitcoin, and a search for a solution to the double-spending problem had been ongoing for more than 20 years before Lehman Brothers collapsed; the idea that bitcoin’s creation had anything to do with Lehman Brothers is goldfish memory in full effect.\n\nMen who understand what money is fully expected collapses like Lehman Brothers, and the inevitable hyperinflation event that is coming to the US dollar.\n\nEconomists from the Austrian School successfully predicted the housing collapse also:\n\nThese are the true origins of bitcoin and everyone knows it. Bitcoin is a solution to the problem of the state having absolute control over the form and supply of money and the regulation of banks. That is why it is so powerful; it solves two difficult problems at once, and offers an unimaginable number of secondary uses that are tangential to the money use of bitcoin.\n\nThe Federal Reserve ""stimulus"" programmes, secret bailouts and money creation that have destroyed the value of the US dollar are well understood by anyone familiar with the Austrian theory of money and even socialists understand that the Federal Reserve is acting against the interests of anyone that is forced to use its money:\n\nThis is the true perspective behind bitcoin, not some sugar-coated false history of why Satoshi Nakamoto created it.\n\nBitcoin was created by anarchists who understand Austrian monetary theory, which limits money supply deliberately because it understands that in order for money to be sound, its supply must be fixed.\n\nProponents of this system understand that money should not be in the control of the state, but should be solely a product or service produced by the market. These facts are missing from Ludwin\'s talk, and the omission is deliberate. He knows how to speak to these bankers, and he knows their severe limitations when it comes to computers and software.\n\nThey work primarily on instinct and emotion in this area; any mention of the Austrian school, the reasons for the limited money supply, Anarchism or the anti-Fed animus built into bitcoin would cause these people to reject the idea he is selling, no matter what it is worth or its capabilities.\n\nRole reversal\n\nThis is why, for many years, people simply did not accept that bitcoin did what its proponents claimed it could do, despite the software being available and examinable.\n\nThese people don’t understand anything connected with the computer world; they are leaves in the wind, where the wind is coming from a hand-held blower, wielded by software vendors.\n\nEvidence that Ludwin has dumbed down his talk to suit his audience’s capacity is found in his use of the phrase, ""In an obscure corner of the Internet"". There are no ""obscure corners of the Internet"".\n\nAll parts of it are equally accessible to everyone. This is the sort of descriptive language that is needed to explain bitcoin, but which simultaneously plagues it, because many of the men trying to contextualize it don’t have the eloquence to make a good job of clarifying and simplifying its true nature.\n\nIts also interesting that the widely cited “Bitcoin white paper” now universally held in the highest regard (even by people who know nothing about software, maths or economics) is entitled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”, but these crony capitalists choose to deliberately focus only on the means by which a P2P electronic cash system was achieved, not the idea of a new way of managing and accounting for tokens.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and central bankers believe that only they have the right to issue money. Bitcoin, explicitly created to issue a new form of money, cannot have its name or true purpose associated with blockchain vendors, because the threat to them is implicit in bitcoin’s genesis and operation. More on this later.\n\nLudwin says that the bitcoin network has proven to be robust. Bitcoin has always been robust, was never a Ponzi scheme, fraud, about to collapse or any of the other lies spread about it by computer illiterates.\n\nWhy exactly Ludwin asserts that it is resilient now, and why anyone should believe him over anyone else is not fleshed out in his talk. There is no more reason to think that bitcoin does what its creators claim it can do now than at any time during the vicious, brainless, evidence-less attacks on it by academics, journalists, economists and other assorted idiots.\n\nThis controversy that Ludwin mentions was a tissue of lies from the beginning. Unfortunately, we must all deal with a world populated by men who cannot and who refuse to think, and this talk at the Federal Reserve and their inadvertent anointing of bitcoin will greatly strengthen the perception of bitcoin globally. This is the only thing we have to be thankful for from this meeting.\n\nNow, no one will be able to lie about bitcoin in any serious publication. The same software that the blockchain-not-bitcoin vendors are trying to sell powers bitcoin. If the latter works, the former must work, and anyway, ""The Federal Reserve said it works"".\n\nPower of open-source\n\nOn top of this new faith in bitcoin are the extensions and features that are being added by Bitcoin Core that increase its capabilities. It is impossible for any single government or corporation to out innovate an open-source software project with many developers working on the same system.\n\nLinux is the living proof of this; no one can come close to the amount of genius being poured into Linux.\n\nThat is why it is everywhere, in billions of devices, and increasingly on desktop computers. Bitcoin domination, even as a universal financial backbone, is inevitable and there is nothing anyone can do to stop it.\n\nBitcoin did not create a new asset class. Bitcoin is money, in the same way that fiat cash is used as money, or metal buttons stamped in Birmingham in the late 1700s were money.\n\nInstitutions are buying software from hungry vendors because they do not want to be left out of the latest innovations. The vendors sell them snake-oil solutions to problems that they don’t have, and because they don’t have any understanding of computers, cryptography or economics, they buy these systems and pilot them so as to appear cutting edge.\n\nAs an example, there is no such thing as ""digitizing existing asset classes"".\n\nDatabases hold entries that are text. That is all that they do, and bitcoin is nothing more than a write-once, read-many database. What is happening now with the bitcoin-not-blockchain vendors is a direct mirror image of the intranet fad that happened in the 1990s\n\nThe computer illiterates of that era, were sold the idea of private networks based on a series of false assumptions and an inability to understand what they were working with. Vendors set up a compelling story, and sold them expensive bespoke systems.\n\nThe idea of an “Intranet” which sounds like “Internet” was an easy sell.\n\nMuch less sexy is “local network” which is exactly what these intranets are, and today they work on standard protocols, not bespoke systems. The blockchain-not-bitcoin people are creating the same worthless intermediary step to total Internet acceptance that the Intranet vendors did in the 1990s.\n\nThreat of a FedCoin\n\nOf course, they are free to do this, but because the function of money is what bitcoin is replacing, and because the Federal Reserve and the other central banks have the entire force of government behind them, this will not be like Intranet vs Internet and private protocols vs open protocols debate. If the central banks try and release their own cryptocurrency altcoin, they will anoint it and supercharge it with legal tender status.\n\nThat means that it will be illegal for anyone to refuse to accept their altcoin for settlement of debts.\n\nEssentially, they will move their Ponzi scheme from one set of databases that they have exclusive access to, to another database they own where all market participants have direct access to the generated tokens. That is the only change that will happen; the fundamental and unethical nature of the money will remain unchanged. It will be imposed by force, and its supply will be managed by a secret process. It will be as unreliable as all fiat currency ever was. This is the very definition of lipstick on a pig.\n\nAll asset classes like shares, are already held in databases. What Ludwin is trying to sell in a ""bait-and-switch"" is a new form of database where he claims layers of trust are removed. The switch comes where layers of trust are reinserted because what he is selling is a “permissioned” database requiring trusted parties.\n\nOmitted from his model is that in bitcoin, no one needs to be trusted; all bitcoin-not-blockchain vendors must break the trust model of bitcoin to re-assert the control that the Federal Reserve and NASDAQ (for example) have over who gets to control the money supply and who authorizes shares to move respectively. There is no place in the bitcoin world for the Federal Reserve; bitcoin was designed to destroy it.\n\nThis is the real reason these institutions are testing new networks.\n\nLudwin said that the blockchain is designed to issue and transfer bitcoins. This is true, but bitcoin can be used to transfer any good, tangible or intangible. How is this doable? Stocks and all other assets are serialized.\n\nAll stocks come with a serial number that is unique to the share. The same is true of bonds and even paper fiat money. It is trivial in software terms to attach a stock to a bitcoin transaction – instead of having a printed serial number, a bitcoin transaction can be assigned to the share.\n\nThe people behind \'coloured coins\' have been working on precisely this way of representing and managing real-world assets.\n\nProblematic presentation\n\nIn other words, this problem has already been solved, where you have all the now admitted resilience and reliability of bitcoin and the ability to “attach” real-world certificates of ownership to entries in the bitcoin database.\n\nThere is no need whatsoever to create a bespoke, private, illegitimate Federal altcoin, unless your aim is to sell software services.\n\nThis diagram from Ludwin’s talk shown above makes no sense. The yellow circle represents the founding of bitcoin. It then splits into two parts, ""bitcoin and altcoins"", and ""blockchain"". The problem here is that there is no blockchain without bitcoin.\n\nThe downward fork from the ""bitcoin innovation” bubble has an intermediary step called ""create digital money by digitizing existing assets"". This is hand-waving nonsense. The only thing that can be offered here is serializing assets against a database and nothing more.\n\nNote also how the upper terminating bubble says ""no network operators"" which makes is seem like it\'s a dead end of sorts.\n\nOf course, the exact opposite is true; the bubble actually contains everyone on Earth who has a computer; they can all access the bitcoin network as peers and use it as money without permission of ""FIs or central banks"". This is a very problematic diagram, whose effect is to mischaracterize the difference between the bitcoin network and the blockchain-without-bitcoin snake oil being offered.\n\nThe yellow circle in the previous diagram contains bitcoin as an innovation. The big idea of bitcoin is that it is money out of control of the Federal Reserve and the central banks. Its big idea is that the nature of money is not subject to twisted inhuman and destructive fantasies like Keynesianism.\n\nThe big idea of bitcoin is that money is forever fixed in its supply and that it can never be revoked or replaced with bad money.\n\nUsing music and movies as an analogy to bitcoin is helpful when talking about the disruptive effects of software, but in the case of bitcoin, the disruption is not in the manner that Ludwin and the Federal Reserve would like. Converting music and books into data has meant that no one ever need pay for music or books again, unless they choose to. The market structure of the music and movie industry has been transformed by force, and there is nothing that the state can do to stop people copying music and movies. This is an absolute, indisputable fact.\n\nThe losers in the music and movie industries are the companies that used to sell physical products to consumers that contained their intellectual property. Now that music and movies have been dematerialized, the losers are the music and movie businesses and the winners are the public.\n\nThe same will now happen with the dematerialization of money. The central banks and the state will be the losers, and the winners will be the public, as people move to private (in both senses) monies like bitcoin, completely cutting out the central bank’s fraudulent fiat currencies. There are only advantages to switching to bitcoin, and no downsides.\n\nWhen everyone runs their own bank, with global access to send and receive money without permission, in any amount, you will never again see people complaining that a bank where they had an account has shut off their access to their own money.\n\n\'The Transformation\' comes\n\nAll the artificial rules and restrictions of the central bank-licensed banking system evaporate in bitcoin.\n\nBecause it is frictionless and feels extremely satisfying and empowering compared to banking, bitcoin will transform the world at a rapid pace, and anyone using it will be able to move faster than other market players.\n\nThey will have a built-in advantage when they use bitcoin; word of this will spread and The Transformation will be unstoppable like nuclear fission.\n\nBitcoin is not a simple transition to a new medium. It is a paradigm shift. Every assumption about what money is, how it is stored, who should control its production, how it is transmitted and managed is turned on its head in bitcoin. This is not a simple matter of moving from Oracle to MySQL; this is the equivalent of computing without computers.\n\nIts something that is very hard to accept for people inured to the idea that the state should be the sole provider of money; bitcoin is money without the state. It is banking without banks. Its wire transfer without wire transfer services. It destroys everything that the 100 people at this meeting rely upon and take for granted. It ends their world forever.\n\nBitcoin is not a bearer instrument. It is not like a silver certificate dollar from the time before the dollar became entirely illegitimate.\n\nA bearer instrument is, as this $5 note is, a certificate redeemable by someone for something of value. In the past, everyone knew that the paper money was not valuable in itself; it was only a placeholder for real money held by the bank, which was either gold or silver. Everyone knew that if they wanted to, they could redeem the paper for actual money and so they were willing to conditionally and temporarily accept the paper tokens in lieu of real money for their daily transactions.\n\nThat is the true nature of a bearer instrument; it is a document or note backed with a legally binding promise and guarantee from an institution, redeemable on demand to whoever has the note in their hand – the ""bearer"".\n\nBearing this in mind you can see immediately why bitcoin is not a bearer instrument, quite apart from the technical reality of bitcoin that it never moves from one place to another, and is never borne by anyone. It is not backed by any institution, is not redeemable for anything and has no promise, guarantee or contract of any kind from anyone anywhere on Earth attached to it.\n\nAnd this is the incredible breakthrough of bitcoin.\n\nNot only has the double-spending problem been solved, but the problem of relying on a trusted issuer has been eliminated. Now, everyone in the market is the entity that promises to return goods of any kind in return for bitcoin. Instead of a money backed by gold and silver, bitcoin is backed by all the goods on Earth.\n\nMoney is the market\n\nAnyone with anything to sell for bitcoin is acting like a guarantor of the value of bitcoin. Instead of a central bank guaranteeing to give you silver for your certificate, each market participant guarantees to deliver you goods of any kind for bitcoin, on demand.\n\nThe idea of central bank silver-backed money has been turned on its head, disintermediated and decentralized.\n\nNow, the source of the value of fiat currency, in this case bitcoin, is distributed and pushed into the market itself. Now money is not separate from the market, it is part of the market at a purchase by purchase level. It is so fine-grained that it is hard to grasp its size and impossible to measure its complexity.\n\nAll goods and money are one in the new economy; ""The Transformation"". In the light of this, the idea that anyone should rely on a state issuer of an altcoin for money is absurd.\n\nA key principle of a bearer instrument is that you do not have to rely on anyone to spend it. You can steal a $20 note, wave it around and claim that you are the owner, but that would be a lie.\n\nAll you are doing by waving that stolen note is showing that you posses it, not that you are its owner. If you hand that stolen note to someone else, you are trafficking in stolen goods, and the recipient is no more the legitimate owner of it than you the thief are.\n\nHaving control of a thing does not mean you are the owner of a thing. Subtle matters of rights are absent from the thinking of anyone who believes that the Federal Reserve and its funny money are something to look up to and preserve.\n\nDuring his talk, Ludwin sent some bitcoin to the Wikimedia Foundation, whereupon he claimed that, ""it is as if I handed them cash"". Of course, this is not at all true. What really happened is that nothing moved at all. He signed a transaction on the bitcoin database, assigning a portion of existing bitcoin to the Wikimedia Foundation’s private address, using their public key to lock the data to them.\n\nHe did not ""transfer"" anything, and sending bitcoin is nothing like handing over cash. Unfortunately, when you are trying to describe what bitcoin is to men who think a computer’s CPU is the fan, you are very restricted in the analogies you can use.\n\nMoney over IP\n\nBitcoin is not money. Its function and use should not be subject to any law that covers money, and it is no different to any other software that is in use today. Bitcoin is a digital messaging system. It is a messaging system that relies on cryptography rather than trusted intermediaries. It is a messaging system, and nothing more.\n\nIt can be used to send and store any sort of message, but it is best at simulating money. That is the truth.\n\nThe goal of the blockchain industry is to sell its software to computer illiterates. Its goal is not greater efficiency, transparency or integrity; all of those things are gained from bitcoin, and are negated by running private ""permissioned"" databases.\n\nIn his analogy, Ludwin likens the blockchain industry to having a dollar to make a settlement, but this analogy is flawed; there is only one issuer of dollars, and what blockchain industry vendors are offering are not a single trusted, best, infallible authority as the US was when it issued its gold certificates, but counterfeit bitcoin.\n\nMoney over IP is a neat way of describing bitcoin, but the TCP/IP and all other protocols are global and standardized. You do not have separate Internet network protocols for each nation on Earth; they are all on the same protocol by default. That is why they are interoperable.\n\nFedCoin interacting with EUCoin interacting with RubleCoin interacting with IranCoin, where each one has a separate incompatible blockchain, each with a different money supply and policy is a non-interoperable model. Bitcoin, if it is the TCP/IP of money must be a global standard, with a set of rules that are unbreakable.\n\nIf you do not want to participate in bitcoin (the Internet) then you are free to decline the offer, but you cannot impose a broken standard on the entire globe. This is what Ludwin is advocating.\n\nUnderstanding bitcoin is hard. Not only do you need to throw away years of training but you need to have an understanding of computers and the nature of data. Not many people have these attributes.\n\nLudwin claims that bitcoin works because you can transfer a ""digital object"" without copying it. This is false. Bitcoin doesn\'t have anything to do with objects. It works by digital signatures. Saying ""it works by digital signatures"" by itself cannot convey what a digital signature is, but that doesn\'t matter right now. What matters is that Ludwin does not know what a digital signature is, and if he does, he failed to explain it to the central bankers at this meeting.\n\nYou can call bitcoin “digital bearer instruments”, but someone else could call them another thing. Why should your definition be the default that everyone is forced to live by and adhere to by law? And if you convince a great number of people that your description is appropriate, why once again, should anyone be forced to operate by it?\n\nImperfect definitions\n\nNo single man or group of men has the right to define what software is or the sole legitimate purpose of it. These people do not have the right to fence in software and compel everyone to operate by their rules.\n\nNo one needs perfect analogies to describe bitcoin; the use cases and products come from software engineers and entrepreneurs only and not from bureaucrats, journalists and busybodies.\n\nCredit where credit is due; Adam’s description here is perfect:\n\nBut then he goes on to claim that “we can put many different types of assets on blockchain networks,"" which is not true.\n\nBitcoin only stores signatures, and nothing else. Nothing can be put on to it, and there can be no “blockchain networks” just as there can’t be more than one Internet. There can only be one bitcoin, and you do not control it. Bitcoin tagged to shares can be traded without counterparties, but that cuts out the state and its mechanisms.\n\nA first big attempt at doing it is The DAO, and this idea has been floating around for some time. All the best models see the state and actors like Ludwin as a threat, because they are courting the State to make it harder for people to enter the market. They want to close off software developer’s access to the people. It is unethical and evil, and they cannot ever win. How do financial assets get on the network? They don’t.\n\nBitcoin exists only to fulfill its purpose; to show which keyholder controls which database entries, and that is all. It does nothing else, and that is sufficient for it to act as an intermediary in all transactions for goods and services.\n\nYou do not need to “put an asset on the network”. All you need bitcoin for is a means of accounting for something. Once again, this idea of ""putting assets on the network"" is an example of computer illiterates trying to find a use case for something designed to a job that they do not believe needs to be done. None of these people believe that there was a need for bitcoin before bitcoin existed; they were all happy with the Federal Reserve and its fiat currency, inflating money supply and all the ills that were borne of it.\n\nThey had no interest in cryptography, privacy and especially financial privacy, which they believed was inherently criminal and they still do.\n\nPlato\'s cave\n\nNow a tool emerges that solves problems they did not even know they had, and they cannot accept that they have been wrong about something central to their existence and identity their entire lives: money.\n\nRather than accept that their eyes have been opened and they are now free to emerge from Plato’s cave, they stamp their feet and like a spoiled child say NO!\n\n""We are going to re-purpose this tech for something else; we are going to ensure the continued existence of this dark cave by adapting bitcoin to the Federal Reserve, where we feel safe!""\n\nUnfortunately for them, staying in the cave is not an option. Millions of people are going to escape, and because bitcoin will absorb all the money and assets on Earth, they will not be able to eat falafel without touching bitcoin in some way. Today, you cannot buy or sell oil in anything other than US dollars. Iraq was destroyed because it tried to denominate its oil in a currency other than the dollar.\n\nIn the future, all commodities will be denominated in bitcoin. No one will accept any fiat currency for real-world goods, because the the emperor will be stripped naked; everyone will understand that fiat currency is fraudulent and insecure (in more ways than one) and the only acceptable money for international trade will be bitcoin.\n\nA FedCoin will not be accepted globally for several reasons. First, it will be technically inferior from a monetary theory perspective and a privacy perspective. Second it will have the taint of the US government on it, making it unpalatable to many countries on Earth.\n\nOnly bitcoin, the neutral, technically superior, apolitical, global cryptocurrency will be universally acceptable. It is policy neutral, ethical, untainted, reliable, fungible and the most secure. It cannot be revoked, changed, restricted and very soon, spied on. Bitcoin respects your human rights; this is something that the Federal Reserve and the central banks can never offer, because they are wedded to Keynes, the childless, ""the future doesn\'t matter"" wealth destroyer and his demonstrably false economic theory.\n\nInternet of Things\n\nThe “Internet of Things” fad is fascinating, but it is not needed to make bitcoin more exiting. What is exiting about bitcoin is the complete transformation of society from fiat currency to irrevocable sound money.\n\nBitcoin is not needed to open your car door, or do some other Heath Robinson function. Bitcoin is transformative enough as a single use tool. Its effects will be unprecedented and global. The petty, unimaginative, low horizon scenarios where bitcoin is stuffed into 20th century business models are quite frankly, boring.\n\nAnyone is free to develop whatever software they like, of course, but this FedCoin proposal is unethical because it will have the force of law behind it in the form of Legal Tender laws.\n\nIn a properly operating market, these ideas would die because they are bereft of merit.\n\nIn a world where there is a monopoly of force in the market, bad ideas can be made to appear to succeed, which is absolutely unnatural; as unnatural as the idea of ""issuing dollars onto the network"".\n\nThis statement betrays a fundamental misunderstanding, and if not misunderstanding a wholesale rejection of the raison d’être of bitcoin.\n\nThe diagram above is completely absurd. The word “trust” appears above the central bank, which is in fact the very fount of distrust, deception and theft. If the central bank is the seed of this diagram, everything that flows from it is fundamentally flawed and tainted.\n\nThis is precisely the present fiat currency system, only transposed to bitcoin. It is exactly the trusted central bank element of this diagram that bitcoin was designed to exterminate. The funny money, worthless, backed by nothing, multi-colour Jefferson note is now a symbol of fraud, not trust, and this shocking realization is spreading globally.\n\nEven the repulsive “IS” knows that the US dollar is the enemy of all living men and they are doing something about it.\n\nThe fiat dollar coming from this trust box, of course, will not be a limited supply currency, but a fraudulent digital currency guided by Keynesianism, whose parameters will be secret and whose operation will also be hidden on private servers.\n\nThis is an absolute requirement by government, as seen in the video above of Bernanke being grilled by socialist Bernie Sanders. The Federal Reserve and other central banks use secrecy as a governance and policy tool. The radical transparency of bitcoin is anathema to them, and they will never accept that everyone everywhere on Earth will be able to audit them by downloading and querying their private blockchain.\n\nCan you imagine a tool like OXT showing all the Federal Reserve’s manoeuvres in real time? It even makes me shudder.\n\nBlockchain pipe dreams\n\nCentral bank digital currencies are a non starter.\n\nFirst of all, in order to launch one, it would de facto mean invalidating all existing digital balances and paper dollars on Earth. You could not have two systems, a digital altcoin dollar and the old Oracle, paper systems running in parallel. Additionally, it would be like the Federal Reserve or central bank offering consumer banking services direct to the public.\n\nWhy would anyone need a Chase account if they can get their FedCoin and its iPhone wallet directly from the Federal Reserve? Furthermore. there would be no way to stop people developing software to send and receive these coins anywhere in the world, and of course, to secure the network, they would have to employ the hash power of people outside the government, which would limit the amount of control they had.\n\nThe bitcoin network is the most secure because it is big and mined by different self-interested parties. Any network that is small can be attacked; you can’t expose your digital tokens to the public and also maintain complete control. You either have an intranet where its trusted nodes and users, or you have an Internet where trust is moved from the center to the peers.\n\nThere is no halfway measure in this; it\'s one or the other.\n\nCentral bank digital currencies are not ""a better model"" they are a disaster. Just ask the Canadian Royal Bank about their doomed Mint Chip project.\n\nBased on many of the false assumptions and hubris we see in the central bank’s approach to bitcoin, Mint Chip was doomed from the beginning because it did not take into account the reality of what money should be. They worked from an incorrect set of assumptions, and built a product to a specification that was entirely in error. Bitcoin on the other hand, was built from entirely correct assumptions and observations about how central bank issued fiat currencies work.\n\nThat is why it is so powerful; it is fundamentally correct.\n\nThat anyone can claim that a FedCoin is good because it is ""backed by the full faith and credit of the US government"", shows they either know nothing about the true nature of government fiat currency or they are being sarcastic.\n\nFull faith and credit is meaningless. The destruction of the US dollar is proof of this:\n\nThis same organization, that oversaw the obliteration of the value of the US dollar, is now, for no reason, going to be trusted with the creation of an altcoin that is to replace bitcoin? Surely this is a joke.\n\nAll the elements proposed to make this FedCoin digital currency a reality were invented by the free market. From the idea of wallets on phones onward, none of it has come from the state. That everyone should now just give up their liberty to accept a FedCoin is a risible idea.\n\nNeutral economic ground\n\nThere is no way this is going to happen, and if it is mandated in the USA, it will be GSM vs CDMA all over again, and the USA will be forced to capitulate. No one on Earth will accept the domination of a US controlled altcoin as the global reserve currency.\n\nOnly a neutral, global, ethical, unmalleable, transparent and stateless digital currency, bitcoin, will be acceptable to everyone as the keystone money of the Earth. What the Esperanto people failed to do with language, bitcoin will succeed with money! What does the future hold for central bankers and regulators? The answer to this is nothing.\n\nThis is the explicit purpose of bitcoin: to eradicate the central banks and put the money function out of reach of regulators permanently. People are asking the wrong questions about bitcoin.\n\nOne of these wrong questions is “What role should we (the state) play in the emerging digital asset economy?” The answer is you have no role to play.\n\nYou are now nothing more than peers on the network at best. You will only be tolerated if you provide a useful service. Any anti-bitcoin action you take will be rejected by the network’s users.\n\nYour only option now is to capitulate gracefully and set up a mining farm. Perhaps you could set one up in Fort Knox, which would be an appropriate site. Or perhaps you could repurpose your redundant, obsolete and repugnant Internet espionage centre in Utah.\n\nWho knows? Who cares? You people are finished as players in the money business and that is an entirely good and exiting prospect.\n\nFive imaginary roles for pre-transformation actors:\n\nYou can initiate and operate a network, but it will be worthless because it is not bitcoin. You can issue assets onto it, control who has access to it, write your own rules, create products and services that run on your network, but it will never be bitcoin, will never have the commercial advantages or global network effects of bitcoin, and there will always be a better competitor on the bitcoin network that offers products without hassle or intrusions into user privacy.\n\nThe DAO is a good example of this. No one knows who is investing in it and it has raised $180 million in ""ether"" coins. There is no requirement to identify yourself to The DAO; the network takes care of identity, which is folded into who controls the private keys.\n\nEveryone who can think wants a system like this, and the more systems like The DAO succeed, the more popular they will become.\n\nA FedCoin cannot ever keep up with open-source free market innovations and products. They can barely understand the first generation that now exists. They have no hope of competing, not only because they have a technology deficit, but because they are competing against the network – the entire global network.\n\nBlockchain pipe dreams\n\nBitcoin provides protections for privacy. You may have a tool to measure the system, but you will be powerless to interfere in its operation.\n\nCompliance is set to become a thing of the past. You will not be able to ever again answer questions about collateral ownership and anything else to do with what people are doing on the market. Central bank digital currency will never replace bitcoin, it will never power international settlement, and the system will operate with no counterparties.\n\nPolicy makers are going to be made redundant. Their means for influencing liquidity will be permanently disallowed and banished. This is the true face of the future staring central bankers in the face; absolute annihilation and obliteration.\n\nImaginary “blockchain networks” will not lead to a safer and better payments system; that system already exists, and has a seven-year service record of uninterrupted and perfect performance: bitcoin. Central bank altcoin currencies will not be the foundation of a global system; they will be exposed as fraudulent in the white light, white heat of bitcoin.\n\nThe rate of innovation in bitcoin will outpace any central bank offering, and the vendors relying on Bitcoin Core’s software who may be statists cannot control the new features being added to it. Bitcoin is being developed for the people of the world, not the benefit of central banks.\n\nPublic sector leadership\n\nGovernments have played no role at all as inventors or funders at the infrastructure stage of a bitcoin. It is a perfect Black Swan emerging from Pandora’s Box.\n\nBitcoin exists at a time where decentralization and disintermediation are the most powerful forces on the market.\n\nJust as telephony, photography and news dissemination have changed forever, money is last piece of the puzzle because it was the hardest to solve. It has now been done, and there is no reason why government should be involved in it, just as they were not involved in the switch from nitrocellulose film made by Kodak to digital cameras.\n\nBitcoin is no different to digital photos, it\'s just another data service, and the state has no special privilege or right to control it.\n\nYour offer of a FedCoin will be rejected by the market. There is no way you will be able to stop bitcoin. In the end, bitcoin will dominate. You will offer yourselves as consultants, guardians, guarantors and arbitrators.\n\nThe answer to all of your offers will be: no thank you.\n\nGame over image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles. As such, the opinions expressed in this article are the author\'s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nFor more details on how you can submit an opinion or analysis article, view our Editorial Collaboration Guide or email news@coindesk.com.', 'Analytics provided by BBA\n\nWelcome to the all new CoinTelegraph Weekly Market TA Report presented by BullBear Analytics. The timing of this new partnership could not have been any better given that it appears as though bitcoin is on the cusp of challenging price levels not seen in more than two years. While the trek up to the psychologically important $1000 mark will remain volatile, this will pale in comparison to the moves we will see if the ATH’s above $1200 are broken. That said, there remain some significant areas of resistance between current levels and 1K so we would steer clear of FOMOing into the market on either the long side or the short side.\n\nWe like to begin our correspondence with a quick market summary such as the one above, however the main focus of these reports is the market action itself. The charts tend to tell the story in cryptocurrency for a myriad of reasons, and we can use these tendencies to our advantage. So what are the charts telling us about the state of the market right now?\n\nIf we take a look at the weekly chart of BitStamp below we can see that market structure and market symmetry are painting quite a bullish picture. Following the recent weekend breakout above $600, price is now at the top of a supply area and bull trap top that goes back to June 2014. While this should be rather significant resistance, price seems to be reacting favorably at these elevated levels despite what should be an increase in sellers in here.\n\nWhy would we see more sellers? In the Spring of 2014, we saw a countertrend move that took price up to a $683.26 which was the last truly bullish move before the crash down into the $100’s & $200’s. What this means is that many traders that entered the market on that rally expecting new highs will be itching to take those chips off the table at breakeven, which is why resistance around here should be quite strong. Additionally, regarding momentum we can see RSI is now sitting over 80, which puts it in overbought territory, while the short term moving averages begin to accelerate to the upside. As far as volume, the A/D line is slowly trending to the upside indicating continued accumulation even at these levels, exchange volumes are low despite impressive price action which tells us that there is currently a seller’s strike generally speaking, and volume profile is thin to the upside but overall looks fairly healthy.\n\nIn terms of the longer term health and sustainability of this bitcoin bull market, we think that the technicals are telling an encouraging story. Not only that, but given the upcoming halving, scaling improvements, and increase legitimacy of bitcoin as a financial asset, we think there is substantial upside potential over the next 3 to 6 months. Having said that, if the past is any indication of the future, then we should expect bouts of extreme volatility on both the upside and downside as the market explores new areas. In fact, given the recent run from 450 to 675 $, we think at least a brief correction and consolidation is in order. 600 $ and 520 $ are now key support levels to watch.\n\nIn future weeks we will explore the details of the lower timeframes, but for now there is not much to do other than sit back and enjoy the show until the bulls run out of steam.\n\nDisclaimer: Please always do your own due diligence, and consult your financial advisor.

It’s not rocket science, it’s not revolutionary and it’s not even that smart. And it’s not going to change the world.\n\nAnyone who has worked on payment systems – as I have – knows that a payment system consists of two essential components: a ledger, and a means of sending and receiving messages. In a minimalist world, that is all a payment system needs. The rest of the complexity in payment systems arises from incomplete networks, imperfect information and - above all - the need to protect against human fraud and error.\n\nBlockchain is a stripped-down payments system. It consists of a distributed ledger and peer-to-peer messaging. Ok, so the private keys stuff is smart – though it is not without its problems. But it is still essentially a protected messaging service. It is not rocket science.\n\nTo show this, let’s consider a basic human face-to-face trade involving old-fashioned money. You know, the paper stuff. Or, to make this really old-fashioned, gold coins.\n\nSo, I go to the market to buy a sword. (I like Game of Thrones….) I haggle with the trader about the value of the sword, and eventually we agree on a price. We shake on the deal, I hand over my coins to him and take possession of the sword. What is the payment system in this transaction?\n\nFirstly, there are two ledgers involved, one registering coins and the other registering swords. (Did you know that the “suits” in a pack of cards are ledgers? Two of the four suits in Italian cards are coins and swords.) Secondly, there are a LOT of messages. Trade involves far more than simple exchange.\n\nAt the start of the transaction, I have a quantity of coins in my wallet. He has a sword, but no coins. For the purposes of this discussion we are going to ignore the swords ledger, though it is of course a measure of wealth. A sword, if it is tradable, is an asset – a store of value. But as in the Italian card game Scopa, coins are what we really want to measure.\n\nThe haggling process does not affect our ledger balances. But it does affect our messaging. We are establishing a relationship of some kind of trust. If we don’t trust the other person – for example, if the trader thinks the coins are debased, or I suspect the sword has been stolen (and I think the real owner might turn up to claim it) – we are unlikely to agree to trade. Money issued by a trusted source reduces the need for personal trust: if the trader trusts that the money is real, he may agree to sell me a sword even if he suspects I am a jihadi. (I am not advocating this, by the way). But even so, he isn’t going to hand over the sword until he knows for certain that I have the money to pay for it. And I am not going to buy the sword until I am satisfied that I really want it – so I need to see it, and maybe get an independent opinion of its quality and its value. It’s all looking pretty complex, isn’t it?\n\nBlockchain handles NONE of this. All it does is register the final handshake and hand over the coins, and (in the future) it might also register the change in ownership of the sword. The rest is entirely human negotiation. And marketing, of course. Never forget about marketing.\n\nIn my sword-versus-coin example, the exchange is instant: I hand over my coins, the trader hands over the sword. There is no distance and no delay. If all transactions were like this, there would be no need for intermediaries. But of course most transactions are not face-to-face. They are at a distance. The parties may never meet, and their means of establishing sufficient trust to trade may involve third parties, such as guarantors and credit scoring agencies. ALL distance contracts, without exception, involve some form of credit, simply because there are inevitably delays between agreeing to the trade, receiving the payment and supplying the goods. Using trusted intermediaries such as banks (yes, I know….) mitigates the risk that the payment and/or the goods may never arrive. The “letter of credit” revolutionized international trade.\n\nThis is where blockchain adds value. Blockchain eliminates the problem of incomplete information (you don’t know what I have in my wallet, and I don’t know what you have in yours). And since transfers are near-instant, it also reduces the problem of uncertainty in payment. This makes distant peer-to-peer exchanges possible without intermediaries, significantly reducing the complexity – and the cost – of international payments. No wonder there is a lot of interest in blockchain technology, with or without its accompanying cryptocurrency.\n\nBut blockchain doesn’t fundamentally change how payments work. When I pay for my sword, I remove gold coins from my wallet, reducing the balance in my wallet: I hand them over to the trader, who puts them in his wallet, increasing the balance there by the same amount. If I pay for my sword with Bitcoin, blockchain technology removes bitcoins from my wallet, reducing my balance, and puts them in the trader’s wallet, increasing his balance. The fact that I don’t have to physically hand over bitcoins to the trader, because blockchain does it for me, obviously makes it a lot easier to buy my sword from a trader in China. But it is not revolutionary.\n\nAnd it doesn’t eliminate the need for trust. At a conference in Ireland back in February, I moderated a panel on Bitcoin and blockchain. One of the panel members sent another panel member speaker half a bitcoin. “Did you get it”? he asked. “Yup”, said the other.\n\nWhy did that panel member feel he needed to ask whether the half bitcoin had arrived? Because – whether he realises this or not - he does not entirely trust blockchain. He needed confirmation from the recipient that the transaction was complete. Traditional payment messaging systems include some kind of payment confirmation. So do less traditional ones such as Paypal, which sends an email when the transaction completes. But blockchain aficionados seem to think such niceties as payment confirmations are unnecessary. Trust the technology. It will never let you down.\n\nThough it can, of course. No technology is completely foolproof. Among other things, blockchain potentially has serious capacity issues. At present, transaction volumes are relatively low, but they are rising fast. As volumes increase, we can expect that speed will be degraded, rather in the way that travelling at 70 miles per hour is fine at 4am when the road is clear but becomes impossible at 8 am when the road is clogged with rush-hour traffic. And when transaction speed is degraded, there will be delays to payment and rising mistrust of the technology. “Why hasn’t my payment arrived? I thought this was supposed to be instant. Has blockchain lost it?”\n\nBlockchain supporters dismiss the capacity problem by appealing to Moore’s Law. They may be right. But the trust issue remains. I doubt if mass use of blockchain would realistically be possible without some confidence-enhancing inefficiencies such as payment confirmations, or perhaps – better - a fun tracking device so you can see where your payment or shipment has got to and what is holding it up. People are much more tolerant of delays if they know why they have happened and how long they will take to resolve.', ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. telecommunications rivals Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc are set to go through to the third and final round of bidding in the auction for Yahoo Inc's core internet assets, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAfter holding a board meeting to review second-round offers, Yahoo will start reaching out to bidders as early as Monday to notify them whether they will make it to the next round, one of the people said.\n\nVerizon, the biggest U.S. wireless carrier, is seeking to challenge AT&T, the second largest U.S. wireless provider, in the third round of bidding, even though its latest offer was at the low end of the $3.5 billion to $5 billion range of the second-round bids that came in last week, the people said.\n\nYahoo hopes to conclude the auction by next month, according to one of the people.

""The Halving"" Is Coming Bitcoin reached its highest price in more than two years on Monday. What gives?\n\nOn Monday, bitcoin hit its highest price in more than two years — reaching $719 at its peak — and prices continued to hover near $700 on Tuesday. It’s a marked jump from even last week, though bitcoin prices have been rising since the end of May. By Monday night, the price of bitcoin has jumped more than 21 percent from the start of the weekend.\n\nThe spike might be due to an impending event in the world of bitcoin that is about as game-changing as its name — the halving — suggests.\n\nThe bitcoin system, unlike typical currency, only exists in a finite supply. So in order to keep bitcoin from being “mined” too quickly by those who discover a block of transactions in exchange for a bitcoin reward, the founder built in a series of events called halvings. Each time another 210,000 blocks are released, the value of the reward will be cut in half. According to Coindesk, that’s slated to happen 64 times before the system will run out of new bitcoins.\n\nBut so far, only one halving has occurred since bitcoin launched, causing the bitcoin reward to fall from 50 to 25 four years ago. That halving had little effect on the bitcoin price —but 2012 was a different era for bitcoin, when the average price was only around $13. The next halving is slated to happen in July, when the bitcoin reward is expected to fall to 12.5.\n\nAs the date of the halving approaches, it seems like at least part of bitcoin rally can be explained by pre-event jitters. The decreased value of mining should be a jolt to the currencies markets, since the supply of bitcoin will probably drop in response.\n\nOther experts have pointed to global instability as another driver of the spike. According to MarketWatch, nearly 85 percent of the bitcoin transactions during the rally were conduced in yuan —suggesting that concerns among Chinese elite about a destabilizing economy might be pushing some to invest more intensely in the currency.\n\nMeanwhile, in Europe, the possibility of a Brexit is fueling uncertainty in the global markets that could be spilling over into bitcoin trading.', 'BITCOIN\n\nArrived late to the bitcoin party? Fret not, because 2017 might be your year.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, the price of bitcoin has already soared by more than 30 percent—from around $450 in May to $690.41 on Tuesday with an estimated 15.66 million bitcoins in circulation. This is the highest value the digital currency has been since September 2014, when the cryptocurrency went on a free fall from its all-time highs of more than $1,000 per single bitcoin.\n\nExperts, like bitcoin entrepreneur Henry Brade, believes this is the best time to invest in the virtual currency, especially since the halving process—which reduces the amount of daily bitcoin created every day from 3,600 to 1,800—is due to start on July 10. Brade expects “the next six months or so” will be crucial for bitcoin as it starts “a new phase of massive price increase” by as much as 10 times.\n\nBut what if you don’t want to shell out $700 for a bitcoin? Well, Japan may soon offer a cheaper alternative.\n\nJapanese newspaper The Asahi Shimbun reported the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. is gearing up to launch its own digital currency as early as autumn 2017.\n\nThe virtual currency is called MUFG coin—short for the bank’s parent company, the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. Sources familiar with the matter told the newspaper that the cryptocurrency will help “facilitate currency conversions to foreign currencies and exchange” with the Japanese yen.\n\nOne unit of MUFG coin will be equal to 1 yen, according to the publication, and users will be able to withdraw money from their bank accounts into a smartphone app. The money, in turn, will be converted to the cryptocurrency. The MUFG coin system is expected to draw in Japanese prepaid electronic money users, such as “Suica,” with its low commission fees for remittance.\n\nNews that the bank was developing the MUFG coin surfaced in February, following a trial run that began in late 2015.\n\nJapan is one of the handful of countries that have taken a favorable stance towards digital currencies, such as bitcoin. Recently, the Japanese Diet enacted a bill that would regulate virtual currency exchanges and their operators in the country, as well as allow digital money to be used not only to buy goods and services but also as an alternative for legal tender through purchases and trades.\n\nComments', 'The price of ether, the native digital asset on the Ethereum blockchain, neared $20 for the first time ever on 14th June, approaching the milestone as it appeared to break out of its old trading patterns.\n\nIn recent weeks, market observers asserted that ether had been displaying a negative correlation with the older, more established digital currency bitcoin. However, the two currencies failed to exhibit this relationship during today’s session, as ether saw price growth that happened in spite of declines in the price of bitcoin.\n\nEther’s price fluctuations also notably took place amid generous trading volume, as 24-hour transaction activity reached $62.7m at one point during the day, coming close to the record daily high of $65.3m reached in March, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.\n\nEther surged to $18.95 during the session, reaching a new all-time high, data from leading Ethereum exchange Poloniex reveals. This daily peak, reached at 04:45 UTC, was roughly 10% higher than the session’s opening price of $17.25. Ether hit this level amid a 24-hour volume of $45.5m, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBut, when ether reached its new high of $18.95, bitcoin was trading at $692.80, roughly 2% below the currency’s opening price of $705.62, figures provided by CoinDesk’s USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) reveal. Later in the session, bitcoin fell to a low of $661.60, a roughly 6% decline from the opening value.\n\nIf bitcoin and ether were displaying a negative correlation, the drop in the former should have caused a rise in the latter. However, when bitcoin hit its daily low, ether had fallen to $18.04, according to additional Poloniex figures.\n\nAs bitcoin has long been the dominant digital currency (it was the first public blockchain to operate at scale and gather a wide user base), traders continue to watch for signs ether is emerging as a viable alternative investment, one that moves based on different stresses and factors than bitcoin.\n\nToday’s price movements should go a long way toward helping ether strike out on its own.\n\nCharles L.

Today, MGT added serial industry entrepreneur Erik Voorhees as an inaugural member of the board.\n\nWhile banks and other financial institutions have been adopting blockchain technology because of its increased transparency and efficiency, McAfee said the board, and an entirely new soon-to-be launched division at the company, are aimed at making the technology more secure.\n\nMcAfee told CoinDesk:\n\n""[Blockchain] is extremely insecure from a hacking standpoint, and that’s my specialty.""\n\nMcAfee said that he believes blockchain technology creates a more secure way to ""verify transactions"", but that the recent hack of cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift and the high-profile case of defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox show that businesses built on top of the technology are still vulnerable to attacks.\n\n""I’m horrified when I see people on their smartphones with their wallet. In 10 minutes if you give me their cell phone, I could have all their money,"" McAfee said.\n\nMcAfee was appointed as chairman and CEO of MGT Capital in May, causing a brief 1,000% surge in the publicly traded company’s stocks. Formerly a fantasy sports enterprise, the firm is in the process of being rebranded as John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc following McAfee\'s addition to the team.\n\nToday, the company\'s stock is trading at $2.63 a share, valuing the company at $59m.\n\nRebuilding a new company\n\nGiven McAfee\'s history with new technologies, the move has already sparked speculation in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.\n\nMcAfee is perhaps best known as the founder of McAfee Associates in 1987, a company would come to be synonymous with online security. In 2010, Intel purchased the firm for $7.6bn.\n\nBut, as for how the new advisory board will assist in MGT\'s positioning in the blockchain space, members were less clear.\n\nVer told CoinDesk meetings will occur at least on a quarterly basis. Voorhees says he expects to take ""several calls per year"" with MGT\'s cryptocurrency advisory board and affiliated companies. According to Voorhees, McAfee ""rightly"" views cybersecurity and cyrptocurrency as ""intertwined"".\n\nHe said:\n\n""Blockchain assets change the nature of cybersecurity from protecting personal information, which is now less important, to protecting digital wealth, which is increasingly important. I’m excited to see what he’s up to and to contribute to the project.""\n\nBut, the Cyrptocurrency Advisory Board is just part of what McAfee describes as a soon-to-be launched cryptocurrency division that would sit alongside new divisions dedicated to areas in military and other forms of security.\n\nIn addition to the Cryptocurrency Advisory board, MGT on Friday announced the creation of a Hacker Advisory Board to steer technology development aimed at protecting against cyberthreats. Founding members include Chris Roberts, Bryce Case and Alexander Heid.\n\n""I’ve identified over a dozen super high-tech products that we’ll be building into MGT over the next six months,"" said McAfee.\n\nStill, McAfee has proven eclectic in his recent project choices.\n\nEarlier this year, he ran for the Libertarian Party’s presidential candidacy before he was appointed chairman and CEO of MGT Capital in May.\n\nImage via Wikipedia\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

On Monday, the price peaked at $719 — far, far above the $200-mark it was languishing at in August 2015. (As of writing, it sits a little below this week\'s high, at $690.\n\nThis bullish period — which comes shortly before the supply of new bitcoin is due to be halved due to a programmed rule — is making a lot of bitcoin-owners very happy, with the value of their holdings increasing by significant double-figures percentage-points. The value of the digital currency hasn\'t been this high since February 2014, when it was trending downwards from all-time highs of around $1,100. (All data comes via CoinDesk\'s price analysis tool.)\n\nBut few people are likely to be profiting more (on paper, at least) from the price spike than Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin — whoever Satoshi is.\n\nNakamoto disappeared from the scene years ago, back when the digital currency was still in its infancy, and his or her (or their) identity has never been ascertained. Theories abound, from the relatively credible (Nick Szabo, a veteran developer in the digital currency space) to the totally outlandish (Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese-American collector of model trains). But consensus about Satoshi\'s true identity has never been reached, and there\'s no indication Satishi will ever come forward to solve the mystery.\n\nBut if Satoshi were to come forward, what would happen?\n\nFor starters, they would have an awful lot of bitcoin to play with. Bitcoin is anonymous, meaning you don\'t know who holds which bitcoin — but you can track the path of every bitcoin through the network, via a public ledger called the blockchain.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the first person on the bitcoin network and the first person to ""mine"" for bitcoin (the process by which new bitcoin are created) is guaranteed to have very substantial holdings. Bitcoin developer Sergio Lerner estimated back in 2013 that Satoshi may have around 1 million bitcoin.\n\nAt $700 per bitcoin, that translates to a fortune worth around $700 million.\n\nWhat\'s also significant is the sheer scale of Satoshi\'s holdings relative to the total number of bitcoin. Because of the way the digital currency is coded, there will only ever be a maximum of 21 million bitcoin. Right now, there are 15.6 million bitcoin in circulation.\n\nThis means Satoshi holds 6.4% of all bitcoin in currently in circulation. And he will hold 4.8% of all bitcoin created, ever.\n\nTo put that latter figure into context: As of June 1, 2016, there is $1.46 trillion in circulation, according to the US Federal Reserve. It\'s the equivalent of one person holding $70.1 billion in USD cash (rather than tied up in stocks, property, and theoretical wealth).\n\nHowever, the Satoshi\'s mountain of bitcoin might not actually be worth that much. Because if they were to start selling off their holdings, it would drive down the price of bitcoin due of the sheer scale of the holding. It\'s like flooding the oil market with a fresh supply of oil: No-one expects it, and it will reduce demand relative to supply — pushing down prices.\n\n@aantonop The current price is relatively fragile and it seems to price in those coins being effectively lost. Do you disagree? — Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) May 2, 2016\n\nWe also don\'t know if Satoshi still has access to any of their bitcoin fortune. It\'s possible to effectively ""destroy"" bitcoin, by destroying all record of the digital wallets they are in. Without the appropriate cryptographic key, the bitcoins are rendered permanently unusable. If Satoshi decided that they never planned to spend their bitcoin fortune after retiring from public life, it\'s not inconceivable that they did this, to ensure they couldn\'t be used at a later date.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto might even be dead, and the cryptographic keys lost with them. One theory is that Hal Finney — the second person to use bitcoin after Satoshi, was in fact Satoshi himself. Finney suffered from ALS, or Motor Neurone Disease, and died in 2014.\n\nThe return of Satoshi would also have significant non-financial implications. As the father (or mother) of bitcoin, Satoshi carries significant moral weight. There has been debate between bitcoin users and miners about the future of the digital currency and potential technical changes to help the network scale up to meet demand. If Satoshi came out unequivocally on one side, they would likely have a powerful influence.', 'Image: Flickr/Judit Klein\n\nThe only thing more uncomfortable for friends and close relations than filming your marriage proposal and putting it online is being really, really into bitcoin.\n\nOn Tuesday, somebody decided to go all-in on both of these modern horrors and became the latest person to propose using the bitcoin blockchain, the publicly viewable ledger that\'s stored on every bitcoin user\'s computer forever and ever.\n\nThis decision could have very easily ended up being nothing more than a permanent digital reminder of one of life\'s more depressing failures, but thankfully for everyone involved she said yes, god help both of these people.\n\nThe initial message was added to the block reward (a handsome 25 bitcoins, or $17,182 USD by today\'s price) sent to Chinese bitcoin company HaoBTC because they\'d successfully ""mined"" a block of bitcoin transaction data and uploaded it to the blockchain. It read: ""Sun Chun Yu: Zhuang Yuan, will you marry me?"" The response, which came in the next block mined by HaoBTC, was: ""Zhuang Yuan: YES!""\n\nIt\'s worth noting that this tale of crypto-love might be too good to be true. The messages were added by HaoBTC itself—both the proposal and the response. Either two people working at the company are about to get hitched, or the whole thing was cooked up by HaoBTC itself to promote its new mining pool, which people can join for a fee and get a cut of the reward coins.\n\nHaoBTC has not responded to Motherboard\'s request for comment.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time that somebody has included a message with a block of transaction data and stored it for posterity on every bitcoin user\'s machine. Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin\'s anonymous inventor, used a similar method to include some text in the first batch of coins ever generated in what\'s known as the ""genesis block."" The message read: ""Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."" Not very romantic.\n\nWhatever happened in this situation, an apparent love story come true is even more pleasant news for bitcoiners, as the currency\'s value continues to soar ever closer to its all-time high of over $1,000 USD per coin—right now, the value of a single coin is nearly $700.\n\nBaby, it\'s the blockchain of love.\n\nUPDATE: HaoBTC confirmed with Motherboard that the marriage proposal came from inside the company, since the mining pool agreed to give each member one chance to sign the ""coinbase,"" which new coins emerge from when a block reward is generated, with a message. In this case, the message was a marriage proposal from a member of the pool.', 'Ethereum holds a top position among the promising blockchain platforms being investigated by R3, the financial innovation consortium that includes more than 50 of the world’s leading banks. Recently R3 commissioned Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin to write a report on Ethereum design, upcoming technical developments and applications in private systems. Buterin’s report, titled “Ethereum: Platform Review - Opportunities and Challenges for Private and Consortium Blockchains,” is online on R3’s website.\n\nButerin’s 44-page report gives a detailed overview of Ethereum’s overall architecture and technical design, current status and development roadmap. Ethereum 2.0 is expected in late 2017 and Ethereum 3.0 in late 2018. These labels don’t have much information attached, but indicate that the developers are pushing ahead at full speed. The report has a special focus on financial applications. In particular, the report provides useful directions to financial firms intending to build private blockchains with Ethereum technology.\n\nR3 Senior Strategy Associate Kathleen Breitman and CTO Richard Gendal Brown wrote an executive summary of Buterin’s report. “In R3’s assessment of cryptographic currencies and ledgers, we evaluate each solution in terms of technical scalability, privacy and the ability to introduce automation into business processes through smart contracts,” notes the executive summary. “There are many attractive features of the [Ethereum] platform: Ethereum natively supports Turing-complete smart contracts and the scripting language is user-friendly.”\n\nThe first part of the executive summary, written by Breitman, summarizes the main points of Buterin’s text from R3’s perspective. Breitman notes that scalability is a key outstanding question for distributed ledger solutions in capital markets, and blockchain technologies are still very much behind, by orders of magnitude, the transaction throughput of mainstream financial networks. Ethereum developers are exploring two solutions to enhance the network’s throughput: sharding and state channels.\n\nIn current Ethereum (and Bitcoin) networks, all transactions are replicated by all nodes, which limits the throughput of the entire network to that of one single node. A sharded network would be partitioned into different subnetworks, or shards, with transactions processed only by the subset of nodes in a shard. State channels ? a generalization of the Lightning Network concept in Bitcoin ? would permit conduct of most transactions off-chain, between parties directly, using the blockchain only as a kind of final arbiter in case of disputes.\n\nPrivacy is another important issue. R3 is not concerned with privacy in the libertarian, crypto-anarchic sense, but with the standard privacy requirements of financial markets. “In capital markets, it’s non-negotiable that the open interests of all parties are adequately concealed,” notes Breitman. Buterin notes that implementing privacy schemes is in the Ethereum roadmap, and in the meantime the developers of private Ethereum networks can go ahead and implement custom privacy-preserving solutions.\n\nButerin outlines the financial applications of Ethereum technology to use cases including blockchain-based processing of financial contracts and derivatives, other financial instruments on the blockchain, digitization of real-world assets, blockchain-based contracts for difference (CFDs) enforced by smart contracts, and collateral management. Some nonfinancial applications, such as identity verification, are useful in financial applications. Other important applications combine payments with nonfinancial services. For example, Ethereum smart contracts could permit creating decentralized versions of services such as Uber and handling the payments without the need for a company in the middle.\n\nThe second part of the executive summary, written by Brown, conveys R3’s point of view. “We view Ethereum as a guide for new ways of thinking about distributed systems, as well as an excellent prototyping and simulation platform,” he says. “As with all new technologies, extensive analysis and simulation will be required.”\n\nBrown questions the suitability of adding scalability, privacy and business logic to an existing platform instead of having those built-in from the start. He says that R3 will continue to explore which aspects of existing platforms can inspire solutions to financial services problems and which aspects should be considered as not appropriate for R3’s members.\n\n.', '3:38\n\n\'The Shape of Water:\' The Creature Feature That Goes All the Way\n\nCan an audience suspend disbelief and believe that a human and a creature can fall in love; both emotionally and physically?

06/15/2016,"['Microsoft today unveiled a new project designed to make it easier for businesses across a wide range of industries to build consortiums that better take advantage of blockchain technology.\n\nSince a distributed ledger technology is only as powerful as the number people or companies that use it, Microsoft intends this new suite of tools to help build those networks.\n\nTo date, a number of blockchain consortiums have been formed to test the technology, with the most notable including banking consortium R3CEV, the Post-Trade Distributed Ledger Group (PTDL) and Dubai\'s Global Blockchain Council (GBC). In statements, Microsoft’s director of business development and strategy, Marley Gray, spoke to the need for a technology that could continue to support such collaboration.\n\nGray said in a statement:\n\n""Project Bletchley is a vision for Microsoft to deliver Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) that is open and flexible for all platforms, partners and customers.""\n\nThe project will be open to multiple blockchain protocols, providing support to unspent transaction output (UTXO) protocols such as Hyperledger, and account-based protocols like Ethereum, with others added as they are developed.\n\nRooted in Azure\n\nNamed after Bletchley Park where Alan Turing famously helped break the German Enigma code during World War II, Gray says that Project Bletchley is a response to working with the existing members of Microsoft’s Blockchain-as-a-Service platform on Azure.\n\nLaunched last November, that platform now hosts a wide range of open-source tools built by Tendermint, Augur and more, and lets users build and experiment in a “sandbox” environment to identify use cases and see how well prototypes function.\n\nMicrosoft built Project Bletchley as an ""open, modular blockchain fabric"" interacting with identity and key management, the ability to rapidly scale, and to help construct ""members-only, permissioned"" consortium blockchains, which Gray says have been deemed ""ideal"" by early adopters across industries.\n\nIn a white paper also published today, Gray described what he termed an “Enterprise Consortium Node”:\n\n""A modular framework will allow consortiums to pick the best of breed components and build their distributed applications regardless of the detail underneath.""\n\nBlockchain middleware and cryptlets\n\nAs part of the Project Bletchley announcement, Microsoft also introduced what it calls two “new” concepts: blockchain middleware and cryptlets.\n\n""Blockchain middleware will provide core services functioning in the cloud, like identity and operations management,"" wrote Gray. ""In addition to data and intelligence services like analytics and machine learning.""\n\nThe blockchain middleware is designed to help users take advantage of the increased security of blockchain and its immutable record of transactions, while at the same time delivering business intelligence in the form of reports required by regulators and others.\n\nCryptlets, on the other hand, only come into play when blockchain users need additional transaction information such as date and time in order to execute a contract.\n\n""Cryptlets, a new building block of blockchain technology, will enable secure interoperation and communication between Microsoft Azure, ecosystem middleware and customer technologies,"" wrote Gray.\n\nThe entire white paper is available here and more information about Project Bletchley will be disclosed at Microsoft\'s World Wide Partner Conference from 12th to 16th July in Toronto, Canada.

The publication cited sources who revealed that the bank will publicly issue the digital currency in autumn 2017.\n\nWithout revealing any details nor official announcements, the bank’s spokesman did not give much away. Still, he stated:\n\nHowever, we can only stay that it’s true that MUFG is conducting demonstration experiments on the ‘Coin’ within the company [by] utilizing block chain technology.\n\nMUFG, or Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., is the parent company of the bank.\n\nThe rumored details of the bank-issued digital currency shows some insight into the financial institution’s plans for its own token currency.\n\nMost notably, the conversion rate of one MUFG coin will be equal to one Japanese yen, a measure that will be known for its simplicity when the coin goes public. Users will be able to withdraw money from their bank accounts through an app on a smartphone. They money will then be converted to the coin token.\n\nThe bank knows there is competition via existing prepaid electronic money platforms who are already operating in the country. It aims to beat them all by offering significantly lowered commission fees for remittances of any kind.\n\nThe report from the Shimbun also revealed bitcoin ATMs developed by the Japanese megabank, primed for launch in Spring 2018. Users will also be able to convert MUFG coins to fiat currency using the ATM, the original report revealed.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', 'The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) has submitted comments to the IRS that seek to encourage the US tax agency to provide additional clarity as to how bitcoin and digital currency users should report their handling of the technology for tax purposes.\n\nThe comment, submitted on 10th June 2016, asserts that the lack of specificity in the tax treatment of virtual currency has become a ""concern"" for tax professionals, and details 10 areas where the 400,000-member organization believes improvements can be made to the original guidance.\n\nThe comments come more than two years after the IRS issued a notice indicating that it would tax digital currencies as property, meaning that users had to report profits and losses, even when using the technology for everyday payments.\n\nIn multiple sections, the lack of clarity as to how the everyday use of digital currency is meant to be accounted for was the main subject of focus.\n\nLewis wrote:\n\n""Taxpayers are required to specifically identify which virtual currency lot was used for each transaction in order to properly determine the gain or loss for that particular transaction.

The bank has over half a million customers around the world, enabling them to make real-time deposits from bitcoin transfers into 18 local currencies currently offered by WB21.\n\nWB21 will be using leading bitcoin payment processor BitPay to enable the feature. In essence, it is very likely that customers will be able to deposit bitcoin with zero confirmations, quickening the process to gain funds into their checking accounts.\n\nFor a digital bank, accepting the biggest cryptocurrency of them all was a relative no-brainer.\n\n“A bank accepting bitcoin is quite unusual, however it makes total sense for us and provides huge benefits to our clients,” stated WB21 founder and CEO Michael Gastauer.\n\nGastauer highlighted the advantages of accepting a cryptocurrency that scales beyond borders and regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe problem some of our clients face is to make deposits if we don’t maintain a local account in their country. By accepting bitcoin, our customers can instantly transfer funds to their WB21 account from any country in the world. As soon as they send bitcoin to our address, we credit the value in the currency the customer has selected to their checking account.\n\nThese funds are available instantly in the customer’s WB21 account, which can then be transferred via wire transfers or used to load up a WB21 debit card.\n\nHe further added:\n\nThe process to convert bitcoin into cash on a bank account is the fastest I am aware of. For us, the acceptance of Bitcoin is a great way to support our global roll-out and improve customers’ fund depositing experience.\n\nWhile not a “legacy” bank, WB21 is still a licensed financial institution with a monthly payment volume of over $400 million transacted by some 700,000 customers across 180 countries.

They check with the counterparties whether the trade has happened, make the payment instructions, etc.\n\n“Using blockchain, real-time, the two brokers inform the exchange of the trade, which can be validated, and immediately the transfer instructions go to the bank or the settlement depository. You can transfer the money and the stock. So, technically, this data is stored with the broker, the exchange, the depository, the clearing agents on a private blockchain; so everyone knows what trade has happened,” Nandwani said.\n\nThis shared database (or distributed ledgers) on the blockchain enables every party involved to individually verify the transaction, and hence reduce the chances of fraud.\n\nUK-based Global Markets Exchange Group (GMEX Group), a derivatives exchange mostly for interest rate swaps, is the first to integrate uClear in its subsidiary GMEX Technologies.\n\nIn a press release, uTrade said the first stage of adoption will be in over-the-counter segments and will bypass existing central clearing infrastructure such as foreign exchange and the fixed income securities markets.\n\nGlobally, exchanges have only begun experimenting with blockchain to speed up the settlement process in securities transactions, with the International Organisation of Securities Commissions and the World Federation of Exchanges studying the new technology.\n\nLinq, the blockchain ledger technology at Nasdaq, made its first successful transaction last December. Tallinn Stock Exchange (Estonia) and Australian Securities Exchange are making their proof-of-concept trials with this.\n\n“There are issues of privacy and confidentiality with using blockchain in exchanges,” a senior stock exchange source told BusinessLine, “and we don’t know how hack-proof this technology is; a private blockchain, which most clearing organisations would probably use, also makes it more vulnerable to attacks. Generally, blockchain technology has proved its safety with bitcoin currency transactions but it has not been tried on this scale (of a securities market) yet, especially without the central banks also endorsing the use of distributed ledger technology for funds transfer. We also don't know how the legal system would deal with blockchain, when it comes to disputes resolution and thefts.”\n\n(This article was published on June 15, 2016)"", ""WAVES, a decentralized platform \u200bwhich uses custom Blockchain tokens to represent value, has finished ICO, raising over $16.000.000 USD in Bitcoin.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to Alexander Rugaev, Chief Business Development Officer at WAVES, about the features of the platform, Yobit failure and the Wave coin soon to be available on exchanges.\n\nCT: How much Bitcoin was raised?\n\nAlexander Rugaev: WAVES finished ICO in June 2016 and raised over $16.000.000 USD in Bitcoins. It is considered to be the biggest amount in BTC even compared to Ethereum.\n\nCT: How does the Waves platform work?\n\nAR: Put simply it’s like combining Ripple with Next and Tether. In future the banking finance sector will have token gateways which will implement USD, EUR, GBP, CNY. This is the first priority of the team and we hope it will be done by September at the latest, but in a stable decentralized trading system on top the Wave platform.\n\nThe second priority is the decentralization of crowdfunding. We want to make it possible for those people without bank accounts to easily transfer money. We believe that stable coins could be crypto analog for bank accounts.\n\nHowever, all the fiat operations will be AML/KYC compliant and the financial gateways will be similar to Ripple. We would also like our partners to issue Waves-linked debit cards by 2017. This way it will be possible to trade any asset pair in future.\n\nCT: How will the Waves platform assure users of the stability of the fiat tokens?\n\nAR: Every issued token will be backed up by the same amount of fiat currency at gateways bank account, plus a few layers of security, combined with multi-signatures to issue and redeem tokens and regular or real-time audit.\n\nSo the amounts of tokens will always be equal or less than the amount of fiat collateral, like Tether. It will be like digital cash.\n\nCT: Has what happened with Yobit led to second thoughts from investors?\n\nAR: We have written a message on our blog and forums regarding this issue. Yobit don’t have any tokens and didn’t respond to us. Maybe they bought tokens on the ICO, and hoped they could deliver or return the BTC to the investors, otherwise it’s a huge problem for them. We made that clear the minute we were informed.\n\nCT: When can we expect to see Wave coin on exchanges?\n\nAR: We have a large list of them. However, the integration process is not fast now that we have to pay out the ICO coins to user's Wallets. After that we will start with the exchanges.\n\nJune 14 was the last day for users to collect their coins.

However, several market observers asserted this decline was only temporary, and that the price could push its price higher in the coming weeks.\n\nExperts pointed to a number of factors, including rising volatility, the coming decline in bitcoin rewards, falling bond yields and the looming possibility of a \'Brexit\'.\n\nCombined, market observers believe that bitcoin prices have only experienced a \'temporary pullback\', and that future price appreciation remains a strong possibility.\n\nSupport persists\n\nThough hovering at a press-time total near weekly highs, the price of bitcoin has been on the move over the past few days.\n\nThe digital currency fell to a low of $661.60 on 14th June, after reaching $719.85 the day before, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index data revealed. This represented a decline of more than 8%, just short of the 10% drop required to signal a correction.\n\nHowever, this $661.60 low seems to have represented strong support, as bitcoin prices then began a steady climb, hitting an intraday high of $691.70 by 20:45 UTC, according to BPI figures.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk that he believes this action has established $660 as a key price indicator.\n\nZivkovski told CoinDesk:\n\n“$660 is now very ‘hot’ support.

06/16/2016,"['TORONTO/OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada is experimenting with a payments system based on the technology behind the bitcoin virtual currency, the central bank said on Thursday.\n\nBank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said the central bank has been working with commercial banks to build the experimental interbank payment system.\n\nThe goal “is solely to better understand the technology first-hand,” she said in a statement. “Other frameworks need to be investigated, and there are many hurdles that need to be cleared before such a system would ever be ready for prime time.”\n\nWilkins, expected to speak further on the issue on Friday, said the experiment is among many financial technology research projects. Such experiments, she noted, are not aimed at developing central-bank issued e-money\u200e for use by the general public.\n\nDetails of the project, which uses the distributed-ledger technology associated with web-based currency bitcoin, were revealed at a payment-technology event in Calgary on Wednesday that was closed to media.\n\nKyle Kemper, an entrepreneur and head of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, who was present at Wednesday’s event, said the experiment is called “Project Jasper” and involves blockchain technology.\n\nBlockchain’s distributed-ledger system allows users to conduct secure transactions with each other without the need for middlemen or central oversight, unlike traditional electronic funds transfers.\n\nA slide from a presentation at the event seen by Reuters details how the banks in the experiment would pledge cash collateral in a pool that the Bank of Canada would convert into a digital version.\n\nThe digital currency would then be used as a medium of exchange and could be converted back to cash.\n\nWhile long known as the backbone of bitcoin, launched under a pseudonym, blockchain has garnered the attention of large financial institutions in recent years.\n\nR3, a New York-based research consortium that includes all of Canada’s major banks, is a partner in the Bank of Canada’s project, along with Payments Canada.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada, CIBC, TD Bank and Payments Canada declined to comment.', 'It feels like we only hear about Bitcoin when the price is either tanking or skyrocketing. And, since it’s currently skyrocketing, let’s talk about Bitcoin!\n\nAs of writing, Bitcoin is hovering around $745 per coin. It has only been worth this much twice before – once on the way up to the height of the Christmas 2013 bubble, and once on the way down.\n\nBut since trading at lows of around $230 one year ago, the price has been slowly increasing until a few weeks ago, when it started going crazy.\n\nSo of course everyone wants to know why. But like any public market, there really is no way to possibly know what is actually driving the price up. But we can guess, so here are a few things that could be behind this price spike.\n\nThe Halving\n\nEver heard of the halving? Well if you follow Bitcoin and haven’t, get ready for it to soon dominate the cryptocurrency news cycle. Let me explain. Bitcoin was designed as deflationary currency – there will ever only be 21 million coins in existence, and fewer and fewer will be mined as time goes on.\n\nThis is because Bitcoin’s core code dictates that every 210,000 blocks mined, the mining reward is halved. So it started at 50 BTC per block, in late 2012 fell to 25 BTC per block, and is expected to half again to 12.5 BTC per block in about three weeks.\n\nSince miners will soon essentially see their profits cut in half, this price increase could just be the Bitcoin economy’s natural (and designed) reaction to compensating for that.\n\nBitcoin Core Updates\n\nBitcoin Core is the code that powers bitcoin. It is maintained by a trusted team of Bitcoin Core developers who are responsible for the direction of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs we discussed last week, the team is working on a few major updates mainly related to increasing the capacity and speed of the network so more transactions can be confirmed faster. While the details are pretty technical, just know that one possible cause of the price increase is excitement about new Core technologies that will soon be rolled out.\n\nWider Economic Uncertainty\n\nThe last option is that there are events happening in our world economy that are bringing uncertainty to the markets. A potential Brexit, the U.S elections, and potential stagnation in Asia are all making both individual and institutional investors wary.\n\nWhen there is economic uncertainty, people usually move their money into safe stores of value like Gold, which is trading at six-month highs. While Bitcoin isn’t typically thought of as a stable and safe investment, that could be changing, especially as Chinese investors are looking for places to put their money that is out of reach of the Chinese government’s strict regulatory environment.\n\nStay Calm\n\nOne last parting piece of advice – as exciting and tempting as it is to watch any form of real money appreciate so quickly, remember to remain rational.\n\nAlmost anyone who has ever been involved in Bitcoin is probably kicking themselves right now for not stocking up a year ago or even a week ago. Others may feel a temptation to stock up right now because they think the price is only going up. This is probably an awful idea. As we’ve learned, Bitcoin is its own beast, and will do what it wants. If you try to time any public market you most likely are going to lose a lot of money.\n\nBecause Bitcoin will go up, Bitcoin will go down, and we will all survive.', ""The price of bitcoin broke $750 today, building on recent gains to hit a 28-month high.\n\nBitcoin prices reached $750.37 during the day's session, the highest since 7th February, 2014, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'By\n\nWe told our readers and subscribers earlier this month that MGT Capital Investments Inc (NYSEMKT:MGT) was locked in a bull/bear battle. Well, after a few days of sideways action, the bulls have emerged victorious and shares of MGT are climbing again. As the old saying goes, “what can’t go lower, must go higher.” This adage is certainly holding true and comes as John McAfee positions MGT to be a major player in the Bitcoin space. Judging by Bitcoin’s recent move higher, we certainly agree with this move and proves that McAfee is proving to be a wily adversary for the bears.\n\nMGT Capital Investments is in the process of acquiring a diverse portfolio of cyber security technologies. With cyber security industry pioneer, John McAfee, at its helm, MGT Capital is positioned to address various cyber threats through advanced protection technologies for mobile and personal tech devices, including tablets and smart phones. The Company is currently in the process of acquiring D-Vasive, a provider of leading edge anti-spy software, and Demonsaw, a provider of a secure and anonymous file sharing software platform. MGT Capital intends to change its corporate name to “John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc.” upon closing of the D-Vasive transaction.\n\nThe focus on bitcoin is a smart move because of current global uncertainties. Investors are concerned over Brexit, Fed rate hikes, a strengthening yen, rising gold prices, and the upcoming US Presidential election. As a result, there’s been a rush to safety and Bitcoin is benefiting. MGT got the ball rolling when it appointed Roger Ver as the Chairman of the Company’s newly formed “Cryptocurrency Advisory Board.” The goal of the Cryptocurrency Advisory Board is to ensure that MGT remains current in the protection of this critical field and provide the most state of the art products to its customers.\n\nVer is certainly the right man to lead these efforts. He was an early investor in Bitcoin currency and his venture MemoryDealers.com, a website that sells discounted computer parts, was the first mainstream business to accept bitcoins as payment. He has since helped seed approximately a dozen different businesses involving bitcoin and actively promotes the currency, earning him the nickname the “Bitcoin Jesus.” John McAfee said:\n\n“Roger and I both understand that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and that the greatest risk to cryptocurrency users is the uneven security surrounding these currencies. Even the most experienced Bitcoin user, for example, risks financial loss if a clever hacker targets them. Key loggers and screen capture spyware – which can easily be planted on mobile device or laptops by simply visiting a website, among other simple means of infiltration – can override most security features of existing wallets. If these types of cyber threats are not remedied, the world risks financial chaos as cryptocurrencies are widely adopted.”\n\nMGT followed up Ver’s appointment by quickly adding Erik Voorhees and Bruce Fenton to its Cryptocurrency Advisory Board. Erik Voorhees is a highly recognized serial Bitcoin advocate and entrepreneur. Currently, he is the founder and CEO of the instant bitcoin and altcoin exchange ShapeShift.io. ShapeShift provides APIs and Web plug-ins that allow users to exchange a wide variety of cryptocurrencies and easily convert from one cryptocurrency to another. Previously, Voorhees co-founded the bitcoin company Coinapult, a cryptocurrency wallet and broker, which allows users to buy, sell, send and receive bitcoin all in one place. He also served as the Head of Marketing at BitInstant, an online payment processor that facilitates the transfer of funds between Bitcoin exchanges. Voorhees was the founder and partial owner of SatoshiDICE, the leading bitcoin gambling website in terms of amount wagered.\n\nBruce Fenton is currently the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, and founder and CEO of Atlantic Financial. He is a leading economic strategist and advisor with a focus on the changing global economy. Fenton is a specialist in emerging technology such as digital currency and emerging markets. Fenton also advises U.S. and global investment clients and provides consulting and project based services to banks, financial organizations, charitable organizations and families. He has worked with a major leading U.S. based private equity and investment firm, one of the world’s largest global charities and several other families and foundations.\n\nCurrently trading with a market cap of $75 million, MGT is one of the most exciting and compelling stories trading today. It has attracted a mix of believers and haters. As we’ve said before:\n\n“Investors are focusing more on what McAfee plans to accomplish with MGT rather than the issues the bears have raised. While we can’t say we disagree with everything the bears are saying and there are some red flags with MGT and upcoming dilution, Mr Market is telling us that they are wrong and Mr Market wants to go higher. We have found that it’s much easier to make money going with the trend rather than trying to fight it.”\n\nRemember, the trend is your friend. Don’t fight the trend!

The application and technology has been developed following a partnership with Californian Bitcoin security firm BitGo, an early developer of the multi-signature bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe app brings together elements of a social messaging platform infused with remittance via bitcoin. The app enables users to gain a bitcoin wallet immediately after downloading the application. A user will simply need to link his or her mobile number to the application without any KYC (know-your-customer) guidelines, thus enabling users to send or receive bitcoin in seconds.\n\nThe Global Findex, compiled by the World Bank totals nearly 50% of the Caribbean population as unbanked. Although that number is declining each year, the bitcoin wallet app would bring welcome respite.\n\nAlso read: Bitt Launches the Blockchain Barbadian Digital Dollar\n\nThe long-term goal, as Caricoin sees it, is to help enable financial inclusion for the unbanked and anyone across the Caribbean with a singular currency, with bitcoin being the obvious choice.\n\nIn a statement via a press release, Caricoin CEO Karsten Becker stated:\n\nMuch in the way email changed the world by making communication fast and cheap, bitcoin is changing the world of digital finance and reshaping how we perceive, manage and store our money.\n\nFurthermore, the Caricoin wallet will also provide users the added benefit of topping-up their mobile phones with minutes, a feature certain to be popular in the developing region where prepaid mobile connectivity is favored.\n\nZero-Cost Remittance, via Bitcoin\n\nNotably, Caricoin is also working toward the development of a zero-cost remittance solution that would be included within the application. When activated, members of the Caribbean community working elsewhere can send money back home without having to incur a fee. Currently, it is estimated that remittance fees alone in the Caribbean region amount to over $800 million dollars, as revealed by a World Bank report [PDF].\n\nThe feature will see users buying bitcoin from the Caricoin wallet before sending the cryptocurrency to the recipient. Caricoin wallet users will also be able to pay bills with the transferred funds or cash them out locally in the Caribbean.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Caricoin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The government of Sweden is testing a system for registering and recording land titles that utilizes blockchain in a bid to digitize real estate processes.\n\nLantmäteriet, or the Swedish National Land Survey, revealed today that it is working with blockchain startup ChromaWay, consulting firm Kairos Future and telephone service provider Telia on a proof-of-concept that investigates how blockchain tech could reduce the risk of manual errors while creating more secure processes for transferring documents.\n\nFor the proof-of-concept, ChromaWay CEO Henrik Hjelte indicated that Telia’s technology was used to verify the identity of users registered on a new smart contract system developed by his startup. The demo serves as the first showcase for ChromaWay\'s technology, which it said allows smart contracts to be used with any underlying blockchain, be it bitcoin, Ethereum or a private network.\n\nKairos Future, in turn, managed the process and coordinated an accompanying report, while Lantmäteriet provided feedback and sponsorship for the effort.\n\nKairos Future senior consultant Magnus Kempe indicated that he believes the biggest benefit of the project is the transparency that the blockchain-based system could provide, and how it could position Sweden as a leader in working with the nascent technology.\n\nKempe told CoinDesk:\n\n""What we’re focused on here is the smart contract controlling and making the process visible and transparent.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - The price of bitcoin surged 8 percent to $750 on Thursday, its highest since early 2014, as jittery investors sought shelter in the web-based currency, once considered too volatile to invest in, let alone at times of market stress.\n\nWorries that Britain will vote next week to leave the European Union, as well as concerns over global growth, have pushed down stocks and oil prices, while low-risk assets such as gold and top-rated government debt have risen.\n\nAlong with those conventional safe havens, investors have also turned to bitcoin.\n\nThe “cryptocurrency”, which can move money across the globe quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority, has climbed almost 70 percent over the past four weeks on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. Gold, by comparison, has rallied almost 5 percent during the same period.\n\nDaniel Masters, a former commodities trader who runs Jersey-based bitcoin hedge fund Global Advisors, said he had started to see commodity trading advisors put bitcoin into their portfolios “over the past month or two”.\n\n“Bitcoin is a global, frictionless, instantaneous form of currency, and it has a fixed supply. In this day and age, that ... is becoming very appealing,” Masters said.\n\nOther currencies had been weakened by the huge money-printing programmes implemented in recent years by central banks. With the yuan hitting a five-year low on Wednesday , bitcoin traders said demand from China was also driving up the cryptocurrency.\n\n“If you’re a Chinese investor ... you’re looking at two things: you want to buy something that has momentum, and you want to buy something that in the current environment in China, with a devaluing currency, a shaky stock market, a very shaky real estate market and a very weak credit market, is truly uncorrelated,” Masters said.\n\nAround 95 percent of bitcoin trade is via Chinese exchanges, according to industry website Coindesk, so any increase in demand from China tends to have a significant impact.\n\nBitcoin’s lack of central authority makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as those in China.\n\n“Although Bitcoin is nascent, it fits the bill as a form of digital gold and as a route to evade capital controls,” said Charles Hayter, CEO of London-based digital currency analysis website CryptoCompare.\n\nAnother reason given by bitcoin experts for the currency’s latest surge is that on July 10, the number of new bitcoins that are added to the system every day will be halved. That slower growth in supply should raise the currency’s value. (Reporting by Jemima Kelly, editing by Larry King)', 'The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has published an article in the Finance and Development magazine that looks at how Bitcoin and blockchain technology has the ability to rewrite the financial sector.\n\nWritten by Andreas Adriano, a senior communications officer in the IMF’s communications department, and Hunter Monroe, a senior economist in the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department, the article, “The Internet of Trust,” [PDF] focuses on the history of Bitcoin, its blockchain technology and how it can be used to benefit the financial sector.\n\nWhen it was first introduced Bitcoin became the perfect avenue to provide an alternative to banks and central banks; however, with Bitcoin’s relative anonymity and its ease of trading it attracted criminals, causing it to have a bad reputation as law enforcement cracked down on it during 2013 and 2014.\n\nIt wasn’t long, though, before people started to realize that there was more to Bitcoin than people originally thought, according to the authors.\n\nTech entrepreneurs and the financial industry soon realized that the real news was under the hood – Bitcoin’s underlying distributed ledger technology. Essentially, this is a technology for verifying and recording transactions on a peer-to-peer basis without a central authority. It upends a very basic tenet of payment systems: having one central, independent, and trusted bookkeeper that stores and validates all transactions – a role often played by central banks.\n\nWith Bitcoin, everyone on the Internet can validate and record transactions in their own copy of the ledger.\n\nBank Trust\n\nDespite the fact that banks have tried to solve the problem of creating trust by acting as a trusted intermediary between individuals and companies, allowing them to pay the banks to make the transactions, this only works out well for the banks.\n\nThe authors state, that according to a McKinsey&Company report, banks extract a $1.7 trillion a year, 40 percent of their revenue, from global payment services. Not only that but despite the technological innovation, the cost of financial intermediation in the U.S. has not moved forward a great deal since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nBlockchain to Change the Way of Banks?\n\nWhile the article seems to focus on being more for guidance, it does provide a good overview as to why blockchain technology is viewed as a revolution with many benefits for the financial sector, quoting the likes of Marc Andreessen, who founded Netscape, while still in college in 1992.\n\nMany advocates of Bitcoin’s blockchain technology believe, though, that it can be used to transform the financial sector.\n\nWhile the article ends by stating that it is probably too early to say whether blockchain is ‘the next Internet’, the authors agree that “the blockchain game is only beginning.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Since launching its Azure Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) last November, Microsoft has worked with partners to understand core industry scenarios, and to develop the technologies to bring blockchain to enterprises, governments, and individuals.\n\nProject Bletchley is Microsoft’s vision for an open, modular blockchain powered by Azure, according to Marley Gray, director of blockchain business development and strategy at Microsoft, in an Azure blog. That vision, articulated in a white paper on Github, includes new elements the company believes to be key to enterprise blockchain architecture.\n\nBletchley represents Microsoft’s approach to an enterprise consortium blockchain ecosystem. It marks an attempt to bring distributed ledger platforms to create solutions to business problems in an open platform.\n\nProject Bletchley themes include:\n\n• Platform openness\n\n• Privacy, identity, key management, security, operations management and interoperability\n\n• Scale, performance, support and stability\n\n• Consortium blockchains – members-only, permissioned networks for members to execute contracts\n\nAzure serves as the cloud platform where distributed applications are created and delivered. Its availability in 24 regions, hybrid cloud capabilities, extensive compliance certification portfolio, and enterprise-grade security allow blockchain adoption, particularly in regulated areas such as government, financial services and healthcare.\n\nIt will be open to various blockchain protocols and support simple, unspent transaction output-based protocols such as Hyperledger; sophisticated, smart contract-based protocols such as Ethereum; and others.\n\nProject Bletchley introduces two concepts: Cryptlets and blockchain middleware.\n\nBlockchain Middleware\n\nBlockchain middleware will offer core services that function in the cloud, such as operations management and identity, along with data services such as machine learning and analytics. Such technologies can ensure the secure operation blockchain provides. They can also provide the reporting and business intelligence capabilities regulators and businesses require.\n\nNew middleware will work with existing Azure services such as Key Vault and Active Directory and other blockchain ecosystem technologies to offer a set of solutions and a holistic platform.\n\nCryptlets Concept\n\nCryptlets are a new blockchain technology to allow secure communication between Azure and Microsoft. Cryptlets function when additional information is required to execute a transaction or a contract, such as time and date. Cryptlets will be a critical component of high-level blockchain systems, allowing all technology to work together in a scalable, secure way.\n\nProject Bletchley will deliver blockchain as a service (BaaS) that is flexible and open to all partners, customers and platforms.\n\nOpen source technologies will be this ecosystem’s building blocks. The key to establishing trust within the larger ecosystem and accelerating innovation is supporting open standards for protocol level deployments of P2P/networking, database, consensus and virtual machines.\n\nCore/Kernel/Universal Protocol\n\nAzure will remain open to all consensus algorithms, protocols, databases and virtual machines. But Bletchley will launch a modular framework allowing users to decide what combination of technologies best fits the business domain they wish to address. Since each distributed ledger will ensure that all nodes on that network agree, there will be many ledgers by default.\n\nPublic blockchains such as Ethereum, bitcoin and others will define their protocol stacks, but consortium (a new way to refer to private, permissioned blockchains) distributed ledgers will specify their networks based on the business they address.\n\nIn financial services, for instance, a distributed ledger meeting the privacy, security, performance, functional and regulatory requirements for a derivative contract will differ from one handling cross-border payments. There will have to be separate distributed ledgers operating the networks. It will not need a 1-1 mapping between blockchain and product because similar products can reside on the same distributed ledger.\n\nA modular framework will permit consortiums to choose the best components and create their distributed applications regardless of the supporting detail. It will also permit the components to change barring dependencies developed above the core layer.\n\nCryptlets are the main building block for launching a secure blockchain middleware tier to the architecture. Given blockchain’s distributed nature, the middleware functions naturally as a service in the cloud such as AWS, Private, Google and Azure/Azure Stack.\n\nIn what is referenced as blockchain 1.0 and 2.0, if external events or data based on market conditions or time need to interact with the blockchain, an “oracle” is needed. There is not a standard way to supply “oracle” data securely. It can rapidly become an issue in multi-party smart contracts. Calling data or code outside a smart contract or a blockchain in general breaks the trust, compromising the authenticity of the transactions that depend on it. Cryptlets provide this functionality.\n\nCryptlets are off-chain code components written in any language. They execute within a trusted, secure container and communicate with secure channels. They can be used in UXTO systems and smart contracts when additional information or functionality is required and given using an adapter or “CryptoDelegate.”\n\nA CryptoDelegate is the function “hook” in the smart contract virtual machine that calls the Cryptlet from the smart contract code that extends the authentic and secure envelope for transactions. They are registered at the attested host^1 and automatically created or referenced by developers.\n\nTwo Main Cryptlets\n\nThere are two main Cryptlet types; contract and utility.\n\nUtility Cryptlets have their own identification and signatures registered for use in the cloud. They make up the bulk of blockchain middleware and provide horizontal services such as encryption, time and date events, external data access and authentication services. Developers can find and enlist Cryptlets into their smart contracts to build more trusted and robust transactions.\n\nContract Cryptlets are full delegation engines acting as a smart contract surrogate off the chain. These provide the execution logic, and they securely store the data in the smart contract. They are bound to their smart contract and they are created on the fly when the contract is deployed to the blockchain. Since contract Cryptlets don’t execute in the virtual machine, they don’t operate on all nodes in a blockchain. They can run in parallel and execute on vertically-scaled systems for better performance.\n\nContract Cryptlets can act as bots or autonomous agents, interacting off the chain while maintaining the integrity of the smart contract and the blockchain. They are desirable to consortium blockchains where smart contracts are signed by known counterparties and there is no need for execution of the logic to run globally. This will permit smart-contract-based blockchains to scale computational power and overall performance.\n\nWhen a smart contract has to use a Cryptlet, a CryptoDelegate is called that uses aspects within the smart contract language, such as Solidity. Attributes can be put in the code to indicate the execution of logic at the attribution point is delegated through the CryptoDelegate. For instance, if a property in a smart contract has to be encrypted and only visible to counterparties to the contract, such an attribute can be applied.\n\n[encryptField=”ContractSignersOnly”]\n\nuint public trade_amount = 0;\n\nThe attribute will indicate the field is to be encrypted, but not how. That gets determined at runtime based on a policy that is set in the cloud. The registration of Cryptlets is maintained by a blockchain for the network and it links to a policy stored by Bletchley.\n\nBy using Cryptlets via the CryptoDelegate, the security envelope extends from the smart contract on the blockchain using secure communications (HTTPS/SSL), key verification, attested hosting, and signature recording in the smart contract by the Cryptlet that provides the service. Optional attributes can also allow process isolation for additional security levels.\n\nCryptlets and/or their Cryptlet container can also include digital signatures from or be signed by identities that the Cryptlet could work “on-behalf of.”\n\nFor instance, a user can create a Cryptlet and sign it with a digital signature and perform actions as an agent for the user in a business process.\n\nThe addition of this middleware tier can be considered as Blockchain 3.0; logic and data on a chain with Cryptlets called by a CryptoDelegate from a smart contract for off-chain functionality.\n\nBecause a distributed ledger network’s value is multiplied by its number of participants, consortiums will dominate. This requires interoperability. It also requires management, operations, key management, privacy, identity, and an enhanced execution model.\n\nBlockchain middleware is basically an enterprise consortium distributed ledger fabric that will feel and look like traditional middleware, but it would span the globe functioning primarily as Platform as a Service or APIs.\n\nAlso read: Microsoft partners block chain firms to develop legal-ID system\n\nCore Services Provided\n\nIt will provide the following core services:\n\nIdentity and Certificate Services: This is functionality found in Key Vault and Azure Active Directory to provide PaaS services for authorization, authentication, storage, key issuance, access and lifecycle management. Giving Cryptlet registration and policy and establishing an identity for organizations, people, contracts, key transactions and other things, the service can serve as a platform for others to create vertical services such as asset registration, know your customer service, etc.\n\nEncryption Services: Partial payload encryption, or field level encryption for blockchain transactions with encryption schemes (threshold, homomorphic, etc.) to make secret values that should only be seen by regulators, counterparties and the owner.\n\nCryptlet Services: Attested hosting for Cryptlets to be invoked securely by CryptoDelegates in smart contracts or UTXO adapters. Services such as trust validation, location and secure isolated containers will give the runtime for Cryptlets written in any language to be executed deterministically. Specifications for Cryptlets, CryptoDelegate and Adapters will be provided to the community using an open source so they can be deployed in other distributed ledgers.\n\nBlockchain Gateway Services: Interledger-like services to enable tokenized objects and smart contracts to be passed between different ledger systems. Such a service can give transactional integrity to inter-ledger transactions such as the transfer of financial instruments in a supply chain that spans a number of blockchains.\n\nData Services: Key data services such as distributed file systems (Storj, IPFS, etc.) of off-chain data referenced by public keys. These include advanced analytics, auditing, dashboarding and machine learning services for smart contracts, consortia, blockchains and regulators.\n\nManagement and Operations: Tools for management, deployment, and operations of enterprise consortia distributed ledgers will deliver the enterprise maturity that is lacking in today’s market.\n\nThe base platform tier can be any smart contract or UTXO implementation. If the platform selected supports the Bletchley model, the underlying modules can be exchanged out for partner offerings such as Intel’s POET and Tendermint.\n\nThe middleware tier can be consumed by any consortium node by direct integration of the CryptoDelegate in the UTXO Adapter or VM, regardless of the node’s location (private data center, Azure, AzureStack, AWS, etc.).\n\nMiddleware is needed to provide the common enterprise consortium blockchain fabric for vertical solutions. The integration of existing tools can expose distributed ledger capabilities to end users in a way with which they are familiar.\n\nNew Categories To Emerge\n\nEntire new categories can be developed within the marketplace. Cryptlets, base platform components, new distributed middleware services and full smart contract libraries can be developed, bought and used within the tools end users use every day.\n\nA bank can generate a certified commercial loan smart contract and list it on the marketplace and be paid for each instance created. A small business owner can select an open project funding request smart contract to crowd source a project. A developer can discover a KYC Cryptlet to meet requirements for an application and a consortium can find the next best consensus algorithm to improve performance.\n\n\n\nConsortiums will form and settle into networks. The networks will interoperate with each other with transactions, ownership transfers and value along with provenance and lineage tracking over ecosystems. With machine learning observing these distributed ledgers, no one knows what will be discovered.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and GitHub.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'BTCS, the Bitcoin company is seeing the price of its stocks plummet to an all time low.

06/17/2016,"['The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a radical experiment in crowdsourced investing, and it raised over $150 million in ether, a cryptocurrency that’s starting to rival bitcoin. The funds were stored at an address on the ethereum blockchain (the protocol underpinning ether) where they would sit until members of the DAO decided how they wanted to spend these funds, by collectively voting on proposals put before them.\n\nBut about nine hours ago (from the time of publication on June 17), chunks of ether started getting transferred away from the DAO’s address. As recently as an hour ago, the transfers were still taking place. All told, during that period the DAO’s balance fell by 3.7 million ether, worth $79.6 million at the time. As the hack was discovered, however, the price of ether itself has plunged by 27%, from being worth $21.50 each to $15.59 at its lowest. The price of bitcoin has also fallen by about 6% this morning, putting the brakes on a white-hot bull run.\n\n(Coingecko)\n\nIt’s no surprise that cryptocurrency markets are in a panic. Funds invested in the DAO represents more than 10% of all the ether in circulation (81.8 million ether are in circulation, worth about $1.7 billion before the hack). A massive hack on the DAO’s holdings would be roughly equivalent to a successful heist at a major financial institution. The hack was first reported by Business Insider.\n\nCoincidentally, there’s a pretty good fiat-currency analogy to the DAO hack. The Bangladesh central bank had $81 million stolen from it in an online heist in February, after the SWIFT messaging network, which connects the world’s major financial institutions, was exploited by attackers.\n\nWhile the Bangladesh heist only came to light in March, as government officials began pointing fingers, the DAO theft can be watched in real-time. Here’s the DAO’s address on an ethereum blockchain explorer called Etherscan, and here’s the address to which the apparent hacker is transferring funds. You can see the inflow of DAO funds into the attacker’s wallet on this list. The last transfer, for 258 ether, took place about 90 minutes ago.\n\nCryptocurrency heists happen fairly regularly. Most famously, Mt. Gox, once the biggest bitcoin exchange in the world, saw hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin vanish, leading to its collapse in 2014. But the DAO hack is significant for its size, and the fact that it has shaken the markets’ confidence in the security of the fundamental tools used to build on the ethereum protocol, which Wall Street sees as the blockchain’s “killer app” for its potential to automate routine contracts. While the code governing the ethereum blockchain doesn’t appear to have been compromised, the fact remains that the defenses of one of its largest pool of funds was breached.\n\nIt’s not currently clear how the DAO’s funds were accessed. The DAO community is congregating on its message board, and in a Slack group, to try to answer that question. “Well I think the DAO is now finished,” wrote one poster in the emergency thread created to marshall defenses against the attack.\n\nOthers aren’t so sure. Stephan Tual, a co-founder of a startup called Slock.it, which helped create the DAO, says there’s one way to fix the problem and boost the ethereum economy’s robustness. Ethereum’s miners, who decide what transactions form the cryptocurrency’s permanent record, can collectively agree to do a “rollback”, rewinding the ethereum blockchain to some point before the hack happened. The transactions for the stolen funds would effectively be nullified and wiped from the record. “It shows the community can work together for the benefit of the common good,” says Tual.\n\nThis isn’t as crazy as it sounds. Bitcoin miners have performed at least one rollback, in 2010, to fix a technical glitch. But bitcoin was trading for pennies then, a far cry from the $11.5 billion-worth of bitcoin in circulation today. Ether at current prices is already worth serious money. All the ether in circulation today is valued at around $1.3 billion, at current prices.\n\nAnother question is whether a rollback dangerously undermines a cryptocurrency designed to be decentralized and beyond the control of any single party or group. Tual has an argument against that too. “You need to compare this to a central server of a bank, where they can just change numbers without anyone being aware,” he says. “In this case, it’s completely different. If all the miners come together and [do a rollback], it’s a community action. And it’s transparent, completely transparent.”', 'As Bitcoin sees a stratospheric rise over the last few days, increasing by $100 in just a day, users have noted a corresponding increase in transaction confirmation delays.\n\nMore than 250,000 bitcoins were waiting to move at one point yesterday, according to tradeblock, currently valued at almost $200 million. Tradeblock’s mempool, which tracks confirmation delays, reached an all-time high (ignoring last summer’s capacity tests) of 45MB. Tens of thousands of transactions and hundreds of thousands of bitcoins continue to be stuck for hours or days.\n\nBitcoin users took to reddit en-mass to complain and seek information. At one point, the whole front page was covered by the topic with seemingly new Bitcoin users asking for help. Some, however, maintain that the hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin are all just spam or, in some way, some sort of attack.\n\nHashrate Increase Briefly Increased Capacity\n\nThe Bitcoin network has been running at full capacity for the past six months due to demand seemingly surpassing an artificial transaction cap of approximately 250,000 transactions a day or around 2-2.5 transactions a second.\n\nAn increase in hash-power last month by almost 30% or more increased capacity for a few weeks, allowing the network to run at an all-time high of four transactions per second without any significant delay. During the same period price rallied by almost $300, primarily due to China and the expected halving.\n\nThe brief respite in transaction capacity has now ended as difficulty adjusted to account for the new hashpower, returning Bitcoin blocks to their normal distribution of approximately one block per ten minutes, but the network continues to run at almost four transactions per second, thus creating the all-time high backlog.\n\nProposed Solutions to Full Capacity\n\nOne proposed solution is Segregated Witnesses, which is undergoing final review to provide, amongst many other things, a small capacity increase to 1.5 – 1.8 MB. Activation is expected in early Autumn at best as binaries have not yet been released, with further potential delays from wallet providers and businesses, all of which need to upgrade.\n\nAlternatively, or in combination, a maxblocksize increase through a system wide upgrade is back on the table as, in a surprising move, F2Pool signalled support for 8MB, a number all major miners agreed to last year, but failed to implement.\n\nAn increase of maxblocksize may be further supported by Jihan Wu, founder of Bitmain which, in combination with F2pool, controls almost half of the Bitcoin network. Jihan Wu has recently been very vocal and publicly stated:\n\n“Block should not be too full to stop people using Bitcoin with good user experience.”\n\nHowever, they do not seem to be proposing any action until, at least, next month, due to seemingly being bound by an agreement which states:\n\n“We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production, for the foreseeable future.”\n\nFew, therefore, hold any hope that this situation will be resolved any time soon after almost a year of seemingly never ending debate, but the reaction of Bitcoin’s price now that the hash induced boost to transaction capacity has subsided will be closely watched.', ""In my last post, I alluded to the fact that blockchain (specifically, public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) has capacity issues. This is not surprising, since a public blockchain records every single transaction since its inception. While it has a relatively small number of users and volumes are low, ever-increasing computing power is more than capable of accommodating the rising block size. But if the likes of Bitcoin were ever to become mainstream, handling the number of transactions that (for example) Visa handles every day, either performance would be degraded so much that people would abandon it, or it would become prohibitively expensive. Recording every single transaction on the blockchain is simply not efficient.\n\nOne of the proposals to deal with Bitcoin’s capacity problem is called Lightning. It is being seriously considered by Blockchain.com, which is currently alpha testing its own version. Predictably, Blockchain’s version is called Thunder. It doesn't appear to differ materially from Lightning.\n\nLightning’s proposal would enable small frequently-occurring transactions (Pay Per View, for example) to be taken off Bitcoin’s main (public) blockchain, by (effectively) combining it with any number of permissioned (private) blockchains. A private blockchain would record all the transactions between (say) two users: periodically the net balances would be posted to the public chain and verified in the usual way. Access to the private blockchains would be limited to their users.\n\nThese would, of course, still be bitcoin transactions. All Lightning does is create something all too familiar to anyone who has worked in the head office of a bank: a general ledger/subledger structure.\n\nA GL/SL structure works like this. Individual divisions have their own subledgers, which record all transactions across customer accounts. Periodically, the subledgers broadcast the customer balances to the general ledger. The transaction details remain in the subledger: the general ledger simply records the net amount at the point when the broadcast is made.\n\nNow, of course, Bitcoin is not a bank (or is it?). And Lightning is not creating a customer accounting system. Rather, it is creating something much more like a trust. Lightning itself says these “subledgers” are like “Fidelity bonds”.\n\nLightning’s White Paper uses the notorious Alice and Bob to explain how this works. Alice and Bob together enter into a contract. Each contributes capital to an escrow account, from which either can draw funds in accordance with the terms of the contract. Periodically, the balance on the escrow account is broadcast to the main blockchain, where it is subject to the usual community verification. There is some clever stuff to prevent Alice or Bob stealing the money or broadcasting an out-of-date balance, involving harsh penalties for breaking the rules.\n\nNow, this sounds very like an online prepayment card. You load up the card with money, then use it for transactions until the balance is exhausted. You can top it up whenever you want, even automatically: you can check your balance whenever you want, too. If you no longer need it, you can close it down. Anyone who has used London Transport regularly will be familiar with this arrangement - it's how the Oyster card works. An online equivalent is the Dart charge prepayment account for the Thames crossing at Dartford, Kent. I am less familiar with the US, but no doubt there are similar arrangements there too. Bitcoin may be more advanced technology, but the set-up is hardly innovative."", 'Bitcoin is the financial asset that’s performed better this year than any other currency, commodity or asset in general. Several factors are helping with this, and many sources reported that 2016 could actually have the perfect setting for this cryptocurrency to break its record price of over $1,100, recorded on November 2013.\n\nInvestment in digital currencies, especially Bitcoin, constitutes a new niche that is driving major innovations in the financial sector. These currencies are able to serve as an alternative to the global monetary chaos – with the potential to include the 4 billion people that are currently prevented from accessing traditional financial services. But Bitcoin’s value usually fluctuates a lot, and is currently a bit far from that record, so is it still a worthy investment?\n\nThe answer is a clear yes, and for a number of reasons. For starters, as said before, everything tells us that the value of Bitcoin should keep rising. However, there is no guarantee about when that will happen, so let it be said that this kind of investment is only for people who are not looking for an immediate return, as this is an investment in a medium and long term.\n\nMost of the hype surrounding Bitcoin was created by the overwhelming media coverage, which helped to inflate its real value. Now, as the dust is settling, Bitcoin’s value is its own, not influenced by huge external factors. This makes it easier to measure the real value of this digital currency.\n\nAlso, it is now easier to obtain Bitcoin that it was in the beginning – now we can even buy Bitcoin with PayPal. At the same time, mining Bitcoin is now harder than in the early days. It can still be profitable, but it requires spending some money on hardware, which is itself an investment. Be aware, though: the competition is fierce, with huge Bitcoin mining farms being reported in China.\n\nStill, what really makes Bitcoin unique is the two major disruptions in relation to conventional currencies: mobility and security. Sending and receiving bitcoins is very simple, fast and cheap. On the other hand, the security of this transaction, supported by a decentralized and fraud-proof network, is extremely high.\n\nAnd this is exactly why the financial market itself can no longer look away and disregard Bitcoin, based on the performance that this cryptocurrency has presented. This is so true that there already exist funds created specifically for those who want to invest in bitcoins, such as GBTC.\n\nThe interest of people and the financial market around Bitcoin seems to be coming out of the initial “illusion zone”, and is now reaching fertile land. With more and more regulations and acceptance targeting it, Bitcoin becomes more legitimate and the technology behind it gets even better. With people having increasing concerns about privacy and some fear about the strength of the traditional financial market, Bitcoin’s value should keep rising, which makes a great investment to consider.', ""A bank accepting Bitcoin is unusual but one has just sprung up. Digital bank WB21 says it will be using BitPay’s Bitcoin payment processor for its addition of Bitcoin as a method for its over 650,000 customers.\n\nA major problem this addition would solve, according to the bank’s CEO, Michael Gastauer, is WB21 not maintaining a local account in the countries of some of its customers.\n\nGastauer explains:\n\n“By accepting Bitcoin, our customers can instantly transfer funds to their WB21 account from any country in the world. As soon as they send bitcoin to our address, we credit the value in the currency the customer has selected to their checking account. The funds are instantly available on the account and can be sent out by wire transfers or spent with a WB21 Debit Card.”\n\nBitPay to handle the security of Bitcoin transactions\n\nThe WB21 team told CoinTelegraph via email:\n\n“We are doing a full KYC check for any customer opening an account with us. Once a customer passed the screening, they get access to their accounts and can start using the Bitcoin feature. BitPay is handling security on the Bitcoin transaction side.”\n\nBitPay randomly associates a payment protocol -enabled Bitcoin address to every new invoice created by WB21 customers in the top-up payment process. This ensures that customers can know exactly who they are paying when they transact.\n\nIf they are using a payment protocol-enabled wallet, the system can also automatically collect a Bitcoin refund address in case something goes wrong with the transaction.\n\nA Bitpay spokesperson explains to CoinTelegraph that once WB21 receives Bitcoin funds through BitPay, it is able to instantly credit the user's account in any of 18 different currencies. BitPay settles to the merchant for all Bitcoin transactions received in the merchant's own local currency.\n\nBitPay's Chief Commercial Officer Sonny Singh says:"", ""The Lightning Network is probably the most highly anticipated technological innovation that will be deployed on top of Bitcoin. The payment layer, first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja about a year ago, promises to support a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions among users, at nearly no cost – while leveraging the security offered by Bitcoin.\n\nAt least three companies – Poon and Dryja's Lightning, Blockstream and Blockchain – are currently working on implementations of the technology. But few outside this small technological frontline fully grasp how the “future of micropayments” is set to boost Bitcoin’s capabilities.\n\nIn this three-part series, Bitcoin Magazine lays out the basic building blocks of the Lightning Network, and shows how they fit together to realize this upcoming protocol layer.\n\nThe first part of this series covered basic building blocks, and explained how these are used to establish bidirectional payment channels. The second part explained how a network is formed, and how Hash Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) link different channels in the network together. This third and final part of the series explains how HTLCs are placed inside bidirectional payment channels to ensure transactions can occur fully off-chain.\n\nThe Lightning Network\n\nSo far, Alice and Bob opened a bidirectional payment channel, which they both funded with five bitcoins. They've made two transactions back and forth, and at the current channel state, both Alice and Bob can claim five bitcoins for themselves by “dropping the channel” on the blockchain.\n\nNow, they want to include an HTLC in the channel. This is to ensure that if Carol claims a bitcoin from Bob in return for her value, Bob is guaranteed a bitcoin from Alice in return.\n\nLike the previous step, Alice and Bob start by creating a new commitment transaction each. In many ways, these commitment transactions are very similar to previous commitment transactions. They include a normal output, and an output to a funky multisig-address with a CSV (CheckSequenceVerify)-timelock and a special hash-lock. Likewise, as in the previous step, Alice and Bob exchange their old secrets, to effectively invalidate the old channel. And, once exchanged, both Alice and Bob can sign their halves of the commitment transactions and potentially drop them on the blockchain at any time.\n\nAll familiar territory. Except for one change. Both Alice’s and Bob's commitment transactions now include one new output, worth one bitcoin. (This makes the balance 4-5-1; four for Alice, five for Bob, one for the new output.)\n\nThis new output is essentially the HTLC. And it's even funkier than all other outputs so far, because there are three ways to unlock it.\n\nFirst, the new output (in both Alice’s and Bob's commitment transactions) releases the bitcoin on condition that Bob's signature and the value is included in the subsequent transaction. As such, regardless of whether Alice or Bob signs and broadcasts the commitment transaction, only Bob can unlock this output – if he includes the value. But there is one small difference between the two commitment transactions: if Bob drops the channel, there is a CSV-timelock involved. He will need to wait 1,000 blocks. (If Alice drops the channel he can claim this bitcoin immediately.)\n\nThe reason Bob has to wait 1,000 blocks if he drops the channel is very similar to what we've seen before: It allows Alice to take this bitcoin in case Bob ever tries to sign and broadcast an old channel state. That's where the second way to unlock the output comes in. Alice can “steal” the funds if she provides Bob's (newest) secret.\n\nTwo can play this game: If Alice ever tries to cheat and broadcast this channel when it's already outdated, Bob can claim this bitcoin using Alice’s secret. (He wouldn't even need to provide the value.)\n\nAnd third, as with any other HTLC, both commitment transactions also include the usual CLTV time-out fall-back for Alice. If Bob does not include the value in - say - two weeks (for instance because he didn't get it from Carol), Alice can claim her bitcoin back. Again, whether Alice or Bob drops the channel doesn't matter for this option.\n\nSo where did all this get us?\n\nBoth Alice and Bob hold a half-valid commitment transaction. If Alice drops her commitment transaction on the blockchain, she immediately sends five bitcoins to Bob. Additionally, she can wait for 1,000 blocks, and claim four bitcoins for herself. Plus, Bob has two weeks to provide the value, and claim the bitcoin in “HTLC output.” (If he doesn't provide the value in two weeks, Alice can claim this bitcoin back.)\n\nBob, meanwhile, can drop his commitment transaction at any time as well, and immediately send four bitcoins to Alice. Then, he'd have wait 1,000 blocks to claim five more bitcoins from one address, and another bitcoin from the HTLC output if he provides the value. (If he doesn't provide the value in two weeks, Alice can reclaim it.)\n\nAnd of course, if either Alice or Bob tries to cheat at any point in the future, and sign and broadcast this channel when it’s outdated, both can completely block the other, and steal all bitcoins in the channel.\n\nSettling the Status\n\nAt this point, Bob is guaranteed to receive a bitcoin in exchange for the value (assuming he has it). All he has to do is sign and broadcast the commitment transaction he got from Alice, include the value in a subsequent transaction, and sign and broadcast that as well.\n\nAlice knows this. There is no way she can cheat Bob out of his bitcoin – not even if she found out what the value is through some other means.\n\nAs such, the two might as well just “settle” outside of the channel. Bob can simply give the value to Alice, and Alice can agree to update the channel status to the more normal state without the HTLC and the time-out deadline.\n\nAssuming both parties want to keep the channel open, that's what they would naturally do: it's less of a hassle than having to drop the channel on the blockchain.\n\nClosing the Channel\n\nAnd finally, here's the real power of the Lightning Network: Almost everything described in these three articles will typically never need to hit the Bitcoin blockchain at all.\n\nIf both Alice and Bob want to close the channel “peacefully” they can simply create a transaction from the original opening transaction to override everything that happened since the opening transaction. From this closing transaction, they send themselves their fair share of the channel, as represented by the most recent channel state.\n\nConcretely, this means that if Alice wants to close the channel, she can at this point simply create a transaction paying herself four bitcoins and Bob six, and ask Bob to sign and broadcast the transaction. Since there is no reason for him not to, he will probably cooperate and close the channel.\n\nIn the end, only two transactions will have been broadcast over the Bitcoin network and included in a block: the opening and the closing transactions. That will hold true even if Alice and Bob transact a million times in between, therefore unloading a huge burden away from the blockchain.\n\nThanks to Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon for information and added feedback."", 'Bitcoin and ether both surged this week, the former hitting a 28-month high and the latter surpassing $20 for the first time. The combined rally of these two digital currencies from 10th June to 17th June helped shed further light on their relationship, a matter that has frequently drawn the attention of market analysts.\n\nTo date, the price of bitcoin and ether have correlated positively at some points and negatively at others. Since the two both surged in value in the week ending at 12:00 UTC on 17th June, their correlation was positive during the period, though on closer inspection this relationship is more inconclusive.\n\nThis situation contrasts significantly with the times when bitcoin and ether moved in different directions, which prompted some analysts to portray them as competitors. Sometimes, this negative correlation coincided with market observers highlighting bitcoin\'s challenges and ether\'s perceived flexibility.\n\nBut recently, the two have pushed higher in tandem, experiencing a positive correlation at a time when several developments have been grabbing the attention of market observers.\n\nThe upcoming halving on the bitcoin network and economic uncertainty in China all came up as factors that helped influence bitcoin markets.\n\nBitcoin climbed 33% during the seven-day period, opening at $576.45 on 10th June and closing at $767.45 on 16th June, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals. This sharp rally took place amid modest trading volume, as market participants traded 12.8m BTC in the week ending 17:00 UTC on 17th June, according to Bitcoinity figures.\n\nEther rose even more, enjoying a 42.6% week-over-week gain, Poloniex data shows. This climb took place amid highly erratic transaction activity, as daily trading volume ranged from as little as $11.3m on 10th June to as much as $64.4m on 14th June, according to CoinMarketCap figures.\n\nThis higher figure came very close to the all-time daily high of $65.3m that ether reached in March.\n\nGrowth begets volatility\n\nOverall, the two digital currencies experienced sharp fluctuations during the week, as bitcoin started climbing sharply higher at 22:30 UTC on 11th June, resulting in the digital currency rising roughly 25% to $719.85 at 14:45 UTC on 13th June, BPI data shows.\n\nAfter climbing to this high, bitcoin fell more than 8% to $661.60 at 14:45 UTC on 14th June. These losses were quickly recouped, as bitcoin rose to a closing value of $767.45 on 16th June.\n\nEther experienced even sharper gyrations, surging more than 30% from its opening price of $14.38 to $18.94 at 11:20 UTC on 14th June, Poloniex figures show.\n\nThe currency then fell by roughly 20% to $15.18 by 16:55 on 14th June, before surging to an all-time high of $21.10 at 19:15 UTC on 16th June.\n\nBefore the week ended, ether dipped slightly to open 17th June at $20.51, and later in the day, its price would decline sharply on negative news stemming from ongoing issues at one of its signature projects.\n\nUncertainty ahead\n\nGoing forward, developments such as the halving, economic uncertainty in China and the latest news surrounding The DAO will likely help draw attention to both digital currencies.\n\nThe halving of rewards on the bitcoin network, in particular, has been prompting market experts to give their two cents on the future of the value of tokens on the network. Rik Willard, founder and managing director of Agentic LLC, has forecast that bitcoin prices will enjoy a “pop” following the halving, as it will reduce the amount of new bitcoins generated daily.\n\n""The halving should spur more commercial blockchain applications which should spur price,” he said.\n\nNot everyone provided a bullish point of view, as Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, told CoinDesk that he thinks ""bitcoin prices will experience some softness after the halving"".\n\nHe emphasized that bitcoin has ""more than doubled"" from when it was ""hovering below $400,"" but predicted that this upward climb will not continue.\n\nAs a result, Enneking told CoinDesk he ""would be very wary of making major long bets going forward"".\n\nHowever, whether ether will be affected by this remains to be seen, and doubtless its reaction to bitcoin\'s halving will prove to be another important data point in understanding how these markets are correlated.\n\nCharles L.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', ""Once the “little fork that could,” Bitcoin Classic has stalled and begun to fall, reducing hope for an increased block size limit anytime soon. In the meantime, Bitcoins problems with overloaded blocks and high transaction fees continue to worsen.\n\nDuring March of 2016, the number of Bitcoin Classic nodes surged past the number of Bitcoin Core nodes (2,875 for Classic at its peak versus 1,642 for Core), and the percentage of Classic blocks mined peaked at 7%, or 70 of the last 1,000. However, progress against Core stagnated over the next few months as Classic’s node count steadily diminished after April, and the percentage of blocks mined stalled, eventually falling sharply during June. Currently, 563 Classic nodes operate (compared to 2,887 for Core), and only 25 of the last 1,000 blocks mined were of a 2MB limit.\n\nDivisive approach\n\nWall of Coins CEO Robert Genito believes this failure of Bitcoin Classic to raise the block size limit revolves around a divisive approach taken, including name branding which inaccurately suggests that it is a return to Bitcoin’s original form rather than an evolution. According to Genito, “that's the last thing the Bitcoin ecosystem needs.”\n\n“I can understand why people would disagree with me, and that's ok. The problems are real, and I feel good that the ecosystem will solve it better when they work together--instead of dividing themselves.”\n\nChances for a raised block size limit soon seem slim\n\nMeanwhile, the problems raised by a 1MB block size limit persist. The average block size has grown dangerously close to the limit. ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees pointed out via Twitter on Wednesday that block #416439, at that time the most recent block, had an average transaction fee of $0.55. Gavin Andresen commented in the /r/BTC subreddit that the block size limit should be eliminated altogether:\n\n“Yes, let's eliminate the limit. Nothing bad will happen if we do. And if I'm wrong, the bad things would be mild annoyances, not existential risks, much less risky than operating a network near 100% capacity.”\n\nReddit censorship?\n\nReddit users in the /r/BTC subreddit are claiming censorship in the main /r/Bitcoin subreddit, saying that every recent post related to the Bitcoin mempool, block size limit, increased fees, or transaction delays has been deleted by moderators."", 'Gold’s breakout to above $1,310 Thursday is the direct outcome of global jitters relative to sovereign bonds and the world economy. Whereas the “flight to safety” of the last four years was uniformly perceived to be U.S. bonds, the real negative yields (though nominally still at 1.6 per cent for the ten-year U.S. treasury) has catalyzed a sell-off in bonds and U.S. stocks. Investors worldwide have lost faith in the Fed and other central banks to be a guiding force, and instead view them as ineffective and reactive, fighting a rearguard action against debasement with ineffective tools.\n\nThe writing is on the wall: the only way out of the global liquidity flood that is the equivalent to a global currency hyperinflation is to monetize the debt at the expense of savers. The “financial repression” described by IMF economist Carmen Reinhart et al is underway, and the wages of out-of-control Keynesian liquidity creation are now being paid by investors in sovereign debt.\n\nListen to a podcast interview with Golden Predator’s Bill Sheriff discussing gold.\n\nDown here on the street, we’re not really directly affected by the demise of the bond market, except that we must now look to our own defences as the currency rout begins to undermine G20 purchasing power as part of the hyper-inflationary endgame.\n\nThere are now two paths to choose from in protecting your wealth in the event of a global currency reset: one proven, one novel and untested.\n\nGold, and silver, are proven havens of value protection in times of monetary turbulence, as we are now witnessing.\n\nBut what about bitcoin? Does it actually qualify as a real asset? Or is it just another form of fiat currency, whose value is dependent upon a mutual willingness to accord it value?\n\nMore importantly, what would the purchasing power parity of bitcoin be like in a world where currencies are in a hyper-inflationary? What would benchmark its value?\n\nBitcoin’s value proposition is similar to gold’s. More can only be created by mining. And similarly to gold, mining bitcoin is limited to the rate at which the underlying equations and algorithms yield more bitcoin. It’s reliant on computing power.\n\nAnd that’s where the similarities between precious metals and bitcoin ends.\n\nYou cannot create more gold by adding more digging and processing power. Deposits are discrete and finite, and every time one is exhausted, the value of gold, if not the price, is increased in real terms.\n\nAll currencies are referenced to gold as the historical benchmark, or reference asset, throughout human history. Except, of course, for momentary lapses in collective human sanity when we allow ourselves to be boondoggled by bankers into thinking that a piece of paper – or series of electronic ones and zeros – could be worth more than gold or silver.\n\nApparently, this is the lesson we are unable to learn.\n\nThe bankers, century after century, are able to inculcate successive generations of academics to mount the podiums in universities the world over again and again to brainwash — or should I say, indoctrinate…or oops, that’s not right either: they prefer the term educate — the masses into accepting their fiat product in preference to gold.\n\nAnd century after century, we experience the hyperinflationary collapse of fiat currencies.\n\nWhat is happening now is exactly that historical inflection point, where the modern currency of the day is revealed to be a manipulated sham that is the device by which the elite maintain dominion over the masses. If that seems simplistic, the best explanations always are.\n\nBitcoin’s mysterious founder who operates under the pseudonym “Saitoshi Nakamoto” – published a mission statement at the outset of his bitcoin adventure back in 2008.\n\nHe wrote that bitcoin would be “a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash (that) would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”\n\nWhile the “financial institution” may have been disintermediated, the software and hardware, and the internet, act in a not dissimilar way to financial institutions, where discrete agents with variable access levels transport information that constitutes the infrastructure of the transactional marketplace from a to b.\n\nJust as the human beings in the infrastructure can be motivated by self-interest to defeat the integrity of the whole, so too can software, hardware, and the plumbing of the internet itself be compromised toward non-ethical purposes, as was seen in the debacle that was Mount Gox.\n\nTo me, bitcoin is just a technology-based fiat currency. If the blockchain technology’s only true innovation is to replace financial institutions with technological institutions, I’ll stick with gold, thank you.\n\nGold, as Rick Rule of Sprott USA is fond of saying, “Gold isn’t somebody’s promise to pay – it’s payment.”\n\nJames West is an investor and the author of the Midas Letter, an investing research report focused on Canadian markets.

06/18/2016,"['Sometime in the wee hours Friday, a thief made off with $50 million of virtual currency.\n\nThe victims are investors in a strange fund called the DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, who poured more than $150 million of a bitcoin-style currency called Ether into the project.\n\nCode was supposed to eliminate the need to trust humans. But humans, it turns out, are tough to take out of the equation.\n\nThe people who created the DAO saw it as a decentralized investment fund. Instead of leaving decisions to a few partners, anyone who invested would have a say in which companies to fund. The more you contributed, the more weight your vote carried. And the distributed structure meant no one could run off with the money.\n\nThat was the plan, anyway.\n\nThe DAO is built on Ethereum, a system designed for building decentralized applications. Its creators hoped to prove you can build a more democratic financial institution, one without centralized control or human fallibility. Instead, the DAO led to a heist that raises philosophical questions about the viability of such systems. Code was supposed to eliminate the need to trust humans. But humans, it turns out, are tough to take out of the equation.\n\nA Never-Ending ATM\n\nDAO developers and Ethereum enthusiasts are trying to figure out how they might reverse the theft. The good news is that time is on their side. The thief transferred the stolen funds into a clone of the DAO that likely includes code that, as in the original system, delays payouts for a few weeks.\n\nStephan Tual, the COO of Slock.it, the company that built the DAO, says the thief probably never expected to be able to spend the ether. Each unit of ether is unique and traceable. If the hacker tries to sell any of the stolen ether in a cryptocurrency market, the system will flag it.\n\n""It\'s like stealing the Mona Lisa,"" he says. ""Great, congratulations, but what do you do with it? You can\'t sell it, it\'s too big to be sold.""\n\nThe DAO is a piece of software known as a ""smart contract""–essentially an agreement that enforces itself via code rather than courts. But like all software, smart contracts do exactly what their makers program them to do—and sometimes those programs have unintended consequences.\n\nIt\'s not clear yet exactly how the hack worked, says Andrew Miller, a PhD student at the University of Maryland who studies smart contracts and helped audit Ethereum\'s code last year. But he says the attacker probably exploited a programming mistake that\'s exceedingly common in smart contracts.\n\nLet\'s say you have $50 in the bank and you want to withdraw that from an ATM. You insert your card, punch in your PIN number and then request that $50. Before the machine spits out the cash it will check your balance. Once it spits out the cash, it will debit $50 from that balance. Then the machine asks you if you\'d like to process another transaction. You tap ""yes"" and try to take $50 again. But the ATM sees that your balance is now $0 and refuses. It asks you again if you want to process another transaction, so this time you say ""no."" Your session ends.\n\nNow imagine that the ATM didn\'t record your new balance until you ended the session. You could keep requesting $50 again and again until you finally told the machine you didn\'t want to process any more transactions—or the machine ran out of money.\n\nThe DAO hacker was probably able to run a transaction that automatically repeated itself over and over again before the system checked the balance, Miller says. That would allow anyone to pull far more money out of the fund than they put in.\n\nThe programming language that Ethereum developers use to write smart contracts, Solidity, makes it really easy to make this sort of mistake, says Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell University computer scientist who co-authored a paper earlier this year pointing out a number of potential pitfalls in the DAO\'s design. Others have previously spotted places in the DAO code that would have made such a theft possible. Sirer says the DAO developers have tried to be vigilant about preventing such flaws, but because it\'s such an easy mistake to make, it\'s not surprising that instances of the bug escaped notice.\n\nAll Too Human\n\nAs bad as the bug was, Sirer still thinks that both the DAO and Ethereum are worthwhile experiments. The DAO helped raise awareness of the idea of smart contracts, which Sirer thinks will eventually become extremely important to how the world conducts transactions. The project has also called attention to some of the biggest technical challenges.\n\n""This is a rite of passage for the project,"" he says.\n\nThe Ethereum team is now debating how, and whether, to refund the stolen funds. Ethereum works much like Bitcoin does: the system records each transaction in a global ledger that resides on every Ethereum user\'s computer. The Ethereum team could release a new version of the software that tweaks this ledger to essentially reverse all of the DAO heist transactions. If enough people installed this version, it would be like the hack never happened. That\'s exactly what many people in the community, including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and the Slock.it team would like to see happen.\n\n\'No one wants to see this fail.\'\n\n""Fourteen percent of all ether is in the DAO,"" Tual says. ""No one wants to see this fail.""\n\nBut others think that reversing the transactions could have a damaging effect on people\'s perceptions of ether an cryptocurrencies in general.\n\nAlex Van de Sande, a user experience designer who has contributed to several Ethereum-related projects, and who put money into the DAO, says he believes other ways exist to retrieve the missing funds. Because the thief transferred the pilfered ether into a clone of the DAO, de Sande points out, it may well have the exact same security vulnerability as the original. Developers could just steal the ether back.\n\nThe idea behind Ethereum, much like Bitcoin, was to create a computer system that facilitated transactions using the immutable rules of mathematics. The code would eliminate the need to trust anyone. If people can simply reverse transactions they didn\'t mean to make, it proves that people, not mathematics are really in charge of the system, de Sande says. If the code did something people didn\'t mean it to do, then people will have to live the consequences.\n\nThe fact that a fork is being discussed at all proves that despite the Ethereum team\'s best efforts, machines will always be subject to the messy politics of the human world. But that also might end up saving the project. The heist has divided people and exposed the inevitability of human weakness. But it\'s also bringing people together to fix things. Humanity is making that possible, not mathematics.', 'Bitcoin Classic, a fork of Bitcoin with a doubled two-megabyte block size limit, appears to have failed. Now, many in the Bitcoin community have voiced fears that, with a continued one-megabyte limit, transaction confirmation times and fees will increase to the point where Bitcoin itself is untenable, potentially dooming the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, Steven Zeiler, Software Architect at Zen Software and former software architect for Ripple, holds a different view. He feels that the block size limit is at present a non-issue, and that the Bitcoin economy continues to work relatively seamlessly, with no major threats on the horizon from the one-megabyte limit.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to Zeiler about why the state of Bitcoin is strong despite block size limit challenges.\n\nBlock size limit issue\n\nCoinTelegraph: Do you view a 1MB block size limit to be an issue?\n\nSteven Zeiler: I spend Bitcoin nearly every day for regular purchases, using a variety of wallets, services and exchanges, and in my experience the payment network is functioning exceptionally well. Yes, a cap on the block size will eventually raise the fees per, but I\'m confident transaction verification won\'t be too poorly affected, since most merchants don\'t ever wait for a confirmation anyway.\n\nThe merchants I\'m setting up all use BitPay, which seems to have algorithms for confirming transaction validity instantly with a high degree of certainty. The agorists and smaller businesses I deal with who use regular wallets also aren\'t usually aware of the ""block confirmation"" timescale and simply count the bill as paid when they see the transaction has been broadcast.\n\nI did have one issue last year because my wallet didn\'t have adjustable fees and a payment to a Coinbase merchant online was stalled, and I had to deal with customer service, but since then most wallets I use have corrected the problem by offering dynamic fees.\n\nThough I haven\'t analyzed the blocks, my hunch is that most blocks have lots of room for transactions with reasonable fees, and we will simply see low-fee transactions crowded out. At the end of the day, with services like Purse.io and Airbitz I can save 5-10% or more on nearly everything I need to live, so a 10 or 25 cent transaction fee doesn\'t even register as important to consider in my mind.\n\nConfirmation times\n\nCT: Do you think higher transaction volume will ever make confirmation times an actual issue? Weeklong-plus confirmations, for example.\n\nSZ: Everything being equal, more Bitcoin payments might lead to higher confirmation times, but the trend I see is wallets and payment processors researching and implementing technology to increase confidence. The market for wallets is heating up, and the ones with the best confirmation experience and technology will win greater share.\n\nUltimately confirmation comes down to trust, do you trust the person paying you isn\'t going to double-spend? If so your confirmation time is equal to the transaction broadcast propagation time, ie almost instantaneous. When shopping locally, I feel a high degree of trust with my neighbors so trust isn\'t a limiting factor. Chances are that if a transaction makes it into the mempool, it is going to become part of the blockchain.\n\nCT: You mentioned increased fees not being an issue because of discounts from using Bitcoin. What about with merchants that offer no discount?\n\nSZ: For me, the transaction fee is the cost of doing business, and currently that cost is extremely low. For example I bought two water bottles the other day at Bikram Yoga Portsmouth with Bitcoin, and paid a fee of ten cents on five dollars. That\'s still only 2%, whereas credit cards would be higher. But if I was paying my monthly dues of $100 the fee would still be only ten cents, only 0.1% of the bill much lower than credit cards. Though fees aren\'t a pain, one we are experiencing is lack of a recurring billing protocol for Bitcoin, which would help our yoga studio save money.\n\nPotential from increased volume\n\nCT: At what rate, in your opinion, would Bitcoin fees become a problem?\n\nSZ: Higher fees have marginal disutility, so as they increase, fees become a problem for more, but different, people. For me, fees have never been a problem. If I hold Bitcoin worth $1,000 and in a year or two it is worth $2,000 because of increased demand and decreased supply, then I don\'t really care how much I\'ve paid in fees. Honestly, the actual amount of the fee has never even registered with me. I do always make sure I pay enough of a fee to go through, though. Maybe if fees go over $1 it will impact day to day use, but that is speculation.\n\nIt makes sense that miners would ultimately want to maximize the amount of money they make, and given the market size of the entire world population, it seems that an increase in the block size will ultimately yield them more profits than simply raising fees. I believe the potential for fees from increased transaction volume vastly outweighs the potential for higher fees on the same transaction volume, and miners will tend to act like other economic players and maximize for profits. Higher fees very well may prevent poorer people for using Bitcoin, but I\'m interested in using Bitcoin here in New Hampshire, one of the wealthiest places in the world, in an effort to ditch the Federal Reserve system.\n\nCompetition with fiat\n\nCT: Do you see confirmation times and higher fees making Bitcoin lose ground to another cryptocurrency competitor or, worse, to fiat money?\n\nSZ: That\'s a great question. I would love to live in a world where the general public is actively discriminating between crypto currencies based on their fees and confirmation time. To answer the question in a word, no, if Bitcoin fails to gain market share against central bank money it is because people like you and me aren\'t talking about the benefit of Bitcoin to their neighbors and friends, to the girl at the coffee shop and the mechanic fixing your car. It\'s our responsibility to teach people that they even want better money. Deep down most people know there is a problem with their money but don\'t even know they have options. For instance, three people this week said they were interested in Bitcoin but couldn\'t afford to buy a whole coin! They aren\'t even aware that you can have $20 worth instead of $750.\n\nAs far as losing share against other crypto currencies, confirmation time seems less important than fungibility and privacy since Bitcoin was created by anarchists for anarchists who often value anonymity. When I worked at Ripple, we were measuring something like 200 transactions per second with a final confirmation time of three to five seconds. Why then did libertarians and Bitcoin fans hate Ripple so much? Because their system is designed specifically to not be private and anonymous, so no real people (other than bank employees) use Ripple even though it has superior confirmation time, fees and throughput.', 'The bitcoin price holds sideways in pattern suggesting advance.

The implication is that price is now free to advance again. The top of the rising channel, near $820, is an evident target but bitcoin price has shown on many occasions that it can use a narrowing channel as a cannon to blow it into a parabolic price path.\n\nStupendous advance becomes a reasonable expectation during a bitcoin price rally. Yet, as traders we should always keep healthy account of risk scenarios in the chart. In this case, we see that a break below the lower rising trendline will open decline to the often-mentioned $680 level. This level should offer strong support since it held during several penetration tests around 14 June, and the level is also being bolstered by the 1hr 200-period moving average (200MA, red line circled in red).\n\nxbt.social traders are currently waiting for a specific combination of indicator signals at several timeframes before starting to build their positions for the next wave of advance. The signals occur before every advancing wave in the bitcoin chart and they’re so simple that a child can spot them. The secret is not in complex indicators or fundamental insight or even correct prediction – its simply to have the discipline to wait for the simplest signals to invite you to trade the move.\n\nTo anticipate the market is to gamble. To be patient and react only when the market gives the signal is to speculate. – Jesse Livermore\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price is evidently preparing to move. Weekend trade could see strong directional price action, and two likely levels are explored in the chart analysis above. Advance should make its first stop at $820 (in USD exchanges) and – if a bout of weekend profit taking grips the market – decline should hit a floor at $680.

The partners described a concerted effort to see if they can make fiat currencies like the British Pound Sterling work over a blockchain.\n\nThe experiment created a proof of concept cryptocurrency that offered a “single shared view of transactions,” explained PwC in a release, “allowing every participant simultaneous access to a shared view of information.”\n\n- Nick Bouch, PwC financial services data leader and partner\n\nOn the same day the Bank of England\'s governor, Mark Carney, announced that the Bank is “examining how the technology behind bitcoin can improve central banking services, and is at the early stages of examining a digital currency.” The digital currency aspect is only one of the uses for their experimentation, however, and settlement systems appear to be the main focus of their initial explorations. “The prospect of a central bank digital currency for the UK, in my view, [is] still some way off,” Carney said.\n\nNo more specific details about the inner workings of the blockchain that they created were given, only that the partnership resulted in a successful exploration of the potential opportunities and challenges of using distributed ledger technology for payments and settlement.\n\nThe news of their partnership comes at a time when many governments are starting to show demand for blockchain-based fiat currency. The Bank of Canada is the latest to claim that they are considering using blockchains for their own currency, which they are calling ‘CAD-Coin.’\n\nSeveral other major banks including the Royal bank of Canada, the Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Scotiabank and TD Bank, are involved in the project, as is the banking consortium startup R3CEV. For now CAD-coin remains in the experimental stage only.\n\nCoincidentally, Canada was also the first government to attempt to create a digital currency that citizens could trade with each other, although it wasn’t using an actual blockchain. In 2012 the Royal Canadian Mint developed a USB drive-based currency called the “Mint chip,” but they never perfected it. By 2014, the Canadian government scrapped the program and sold all of the hardware for it at auction.\n\nOn the day before Canada announced their CAD-coin, the largest Japanese financial group announced a similar program that is further along, although the official word is that it is still in testing and isn’t officially in production yet. Mitsubishi UFJ is building a digital Yen on a blockchain that is to be used on a swipe card, modeled after the popular Suica swipe cards that they use there to pay train fares.\n\nThe Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank, released an annual report on 16 March in which they speak of “DNBCoin,” their own ""prototype coin based on blockchain technology."" Their report discussed how blockchain tech could improve their core business, but gave no details on the project\'s release or full objectives, other than putting it in a section marked ""aims for 2016.""\n\nThe historic first instance of a government giving their approval to use a blockchain-based fiat currency occurred near the end of February in Barbados. Caribbean bitcoin exchange Bitt launched a mobile wallet complete with a digitized version of the Barbadian dollar, using the Bitcoin blockchain to keep track of this digital fiat currency. Impressively, this digital Barbadian Dollar has the full backing of the Central Bank of Barbados, a first of it\'s kind for Bitcoin.\n\nThe bitcoin exchange has even received $16 million USD in funding from Overstock.com’s CEO Patrick Byrne, with the goal of modernizing trade in a region of the world whose money has been balkanized. Getting Barbadians to adopt the new form of currency is an ongoing process which has yet to gain much ground.\n\nFriday’s news is unique in that such large players as the Bank of England and PwC have partnered together, but independently, each has been heavily involved in blockchain research before.\n\nThe Bank of England has made the news consistently since early 2013 weighing in its’ opinions on blockchain technology, from the time that they speculated about creating a digital currency themselves, to another time when they considered the harm cryptocurrency would do to the lending industry. Mostly, however, they have talked about and experimented at great length with the Real-Time Settlement aspects of cryptocurrency.\n\n- Bank of England News Release\n\nIn fact, the former executive director of the Bank of England, Sir David Walker left the bank in December to become the chairman of the board at blockchain startup SETL which competes with R3 CEV, although it is primarily focused on settlement.\n\nPwC, one of the four largest professional services firms on Earth, has been hard at work studying blockchain technology for years. The firm released a series of reports outlining the benefits of the tech, and in January opened an office in Northern Ireland for the Digital Technologies team, dedicated “to exploit and commercialise blockchain, the technology that powers the crypto-currency, Bitcoin.” It would be difficult to find a more suitable partner for the Bank of England to work with during their attempt to put the Pound on a blockchain.\n\nThe British megabank’s Chief Information Officer, Rob Elsey, was optimistic about the outcome of the tests and hinted that they’ll be able to deploy similar fiat-over-blockchain networks much faster next time.\n\n- Rob Elsey, Bank of England Chief Information Officer', 'Barron’s report highlights a trio among the “winning” portfolio of 2016 : gold, treasuries and bitcoin.\n\nEd Yardeni, a highly respected economics and investments researcher, recently observed that the technology behind bitcoin has shown the potential to have a wide-ranging impact on financial markets, Dieterich wrote.\n\nRecent developments in the financial markets have not bolstered confidence in government-sponsored currencies, Yardeni observed. Bitcoin and gold, which attract people who are wary of traditional financial institutions, have rallied.\n\nBitcoin A New Asset Class\n\nYardeni noted research papers have cited bitcoin as a new asset class. In addition, financial institutions are exploring ways to use blockchain technology to reduce costs and improve security.\n\nYardeni’s most dramatic observation about the cryptocurrency is the way it has been used to digitize currency in Africa, allowing people to store it on their cellphones without having to open a bank account.\n\nBlockchain To Aid Financial Markets\n\nReferring to blockchain technology as “blocktrade,” Yardeni said the technology has the potential to have a more wide-ranging impact on financial markets. He noted that banks and brokers have started to explore how “blocktrade” helps to track trades and cut trading costs.\n\nA niche ETF company, Ark Invest, last year bought units of the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) and made one of its ETFs the first to own some form of bitcoin, Yardeni noted. Admitting that he was skeptical at the time, Yardeni said he hedged his skepticism by saying to treat bitcoin as a lottery ticket.\n\nHowever, this past week’s bitcoin surge brought the GBTC price up 34%, leaving the ARK Invest ETF with about 3.5% of its weight in the BIT. Yardeni noted that ARK Invest published a report this month with Coinbase that calls bitcoin a new asset class.\n\nThe GBTC has almost doubled over the past month, he noted.\n\nAlso read: The gold standard: BTC price stability at its best since 2010\n\nGold Fund Rises\n\nYardeni also observed that the SPDR Gold Shares exchange-traded fund is up 23%, this year pulling in more than $10 billion in new assets.\n\nThe gold and Treasury bond assets have been driven by fears that central banks cannot improve the economy. Also pushing the assets are fears that a United Kingdom referendum will undermine the European Union.\n\nAs for Treasury bonds, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF is up 14% in 2016, the highest level in a year.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Walmart chain in Canada has announced that it will not be accepting VISA powered credit cards at its outlets from next month. Read more...\n\nWhenever there is an issue regarding fiat currency, bitcoin is sure to have the last laugh. Bitcoin has been around for about 8 years as an alternative digital currency, which is perfectly capable of operating of ensuring transfer of value without the intervention of an organization or a government as the trusted third party. The decentralized, open source, peer to peer transaction protocol allows people who are part of the network to act as a third party to facilitate transactions.\n\nWhen it comes to fiat currency, the story is completely different. Every organization, starting from the government appointed Central Bank to the local bank branch or the payment gateway service provider wants to act as the gatekeeper for their customers’ funds and charge a hefty sum for doing so. Customers end up unnecessarily paying for these services which may not even be beneficial for them.\n\nDissatisfaction among customers is a common occurrence in the fiat industry. Recently, Walmart in Canada made its displeasure towards the payment processing giant VISA by announcing that it will not be accepting VISA powered cards anymore from its customers. While the ban is expected to come into effect from July 18, Walmart Canada is not the only store that is pissed off with the credit card provider. According to reports, many medium and small businesses are also facing the same issues where VISA is charging an unacceptably high processing fee for transactions on its cards.\n\nWalmart Canada’s move will translate to an effective ban on the cards at over 400 locations across Canada. For the first time, Walmart’s move has received widespread support from small businesses which otherwise do not see eye to eye with the retail giant. few of these small businesses have even decided to follow Walmart Canada’s suit and stop accepting VISA from their merchants too. This has definitely started a debate in the Canadian government circles, with bureaucrats trying to find a solution for the high processing fee.\n\nIn this fight, the small businesses and customers are the ones to lose out the most. While small businesses depend on their clientele, rejecting some of them for using VISA will definitely drive away the customer. At the same time, credit cards are supposed to make transactions more convenient, but now it turns out that you should have the ‘right’ credit card to enjoy the convenience.\n\nBitcoin for Visa, a great trade-off\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, can effectively put an end to the whole confusion. It is a well-known fact that the digital currency transactions are faster and cheaper. It ideally doesn’t require any third party payment gateway or processing service either. For few pennies as mining fee, transactions can be easily executed over the bitcoin network. Even these businesses have an added advantage compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world. Canada is known to be favorable towards bitcoin and the regulatory support offered by the government make the transition much smoother,\n\nWill the Canadian merchants continue to fight with the credit card majors or adopt a much better payment method in the form of bitcoin is something that only time will tell. Till then, happy shopping.', 'The Stock Market, Iron Ore, Bitcoin – Is Silver Next For Chinese Momentum Investors? by John Lee, CFA\n\n\n\nThe roulette game all started in the fall of 2014, about 2 years after Chairman Xi Jinping came to power and became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.\n\nXi Jinping had campaigned for socialist economic reform, including a sweeping anti-corruption drive, cutting excess production capacity, tightening of housing credit, and clamping down on gaming in Macau. Public feedback was initially positive. However, largely as a result of those policies, Beijing was facing an increasingly grim economic growth outlook which was the worst in more than two decades*. Manufacturing activity in China slowed along with the global economy and the construction sector stagnated.\n\n*Source: Tradingeconomics.com\n\nIn late 2014, the light bulb came on – someone in the higher echelon ranks thought the stock market could be a penicillin to the economic and social malaise. The stock market is easily accessible to the public and can serve to fill/occupy their free time. A rising stock market provides a desirable savings vehicle (as opposed to low yield bonds), enables listed companies to raise capital and invest, while local governments and banks can piggy-back on the taxes and fees generated.\n\nAs reported by China Daily Asia on September 5, 2014:\n\n“State-run media in China are trying to do something the securities industry has failed to accomplish for much of the past three years: get the world’s biggest population to buy more stocks.\n\nThe Xinhua News Agency published at least eight articles this week advocating equity investing after similar stories appeared in the People’s Daily newspaper and on State-run television last month, part of what Everbright Securities Co said is an increased government push to bolster the market.

All this did was drive speculators away from the market with volumes collapsing.\n\nIn early 2016, as Chinese economic growth and fundamentals continued to worsen, the government turned back to what had worked during the 2009 slump: aggressive lending in the property and infrastructure sectors in Q1 2016 provided relief, and revived the housing market and construction industry. It also sparked speculation away from the stock market and into the iron ore/steel commodity sector.\n\nAccording to an article in the Financial Times:\n\n“The commodities futures market is the most equal in China,” avows one successful trader, before admitting to one drawback: “It’s difficult to meet women.”[2]\n\nTrading commodities in China — also the world’s biggest consumer of raw materials — is relatively straightforward.\n\nTo set up a commodity futures brokerage account in China, an individual needs to provide their identity, in some cases with a video verification, and bank details.

Not only was it the highest daily turnover on record, it exceeded the entire amount of physical iron ore imported by China over the past year.\n\nIn the 12 months to February, China imported a total of 962.6 million tonnes of an iron ore, the largest year-on-year total on record.\n\nIf the level of turnover recorded in Dalian futures on Wednesday was to be replicated over the course of any one typical trading year, it would equate to around 240 billion tonnes of ore.”[3]\n\nThe annual world production of iron ore was 3.22 billion tonnes in 2014, according to Wikipedia.\n\nThe government stepped in, and since May, has raised margin requirements, increased trading fees, and imposed daily movement limits. Excessive speculation on property and commodity sectors, and the undesired restarting of marginal iron ore mines and steel mills have prompted the government to issue a warning on the state-owned People’s Daily which said, on Monday, May 9, that China’s economic trend will be “L-shaped”, rather than “U-shaped”, and definitely not “V-shaped”. Speculators promptly retreated from the iron ore market resulting in crashing price and volume.\n\nThe following chart shows where speculators turned to:\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAccording to a Bitcoin Magazine article dated May 31, 2016:\n\n“Huobi and OKCoin, the two largest Chinese exchanges that now account for some 92 percent of Bitcoin global trading by (self-reported) volume, both reported almost double the usual trading volume over the past weekend. BTCC, China’s third largest exchange, also reported a surge in bitcoin trading volume, setting a new record on its Pro Exchange.”[4]\n\nHuobi’s CEO, Leon Li said that: “More and more Chinese investors and their hot money need a new investment market, and a convenient alternative investment like Bitcoin is easy to be accepted by the traders.”[5]\n\nGiven its impossible to curb bitcoin trading, and with limited bitcoin supply, I would not be surprised at all if Bitcoin approach US$1,000+/BTC in the near term.\n\nCuriously, if a crypto-currency without intrinsic value can muster such popularity, why not speculate on gold and silver? Particularly silver, as it stands out as a “poor man’s gold”, ideal for action seeking, trigger-happy Chinese investors.\n\nIndeed, open interest in silver on the Shanghai Futures Exchange has been steadily increasing this year, with open interest now roughly equal and equivalent in size to that of COMEX.\n\nShanghai Futures Exchange Silver contract open interest:\n\nSource: http://www.shfe.com.cn\n\nThe contract size is 15kg, roughly 500oz, or 1/10 of the COMEX silver contract size (5,000 oz). The open interest ballooned from less than 200,000 contracts in 2012 to over 600,000 since April 2016.\n\nCOMEX silver open interest (‘000)\n\nSource: www.goldchartsrus.com\n\nChinese Momentum Investors\n\nWhat is the take-away?\n\nThe world is welcoming a new class of investors numbering in the tens of millions with hundreds of billions in speculative dollars. Those investors may prefer metals over stocks and bonds. When those finicky investors arrive, they will create a torrential wave.\n\nThey may not arrive at silver this month or the next, but I soon suspect they will buy into this compelling, easy-to-understand investment choice. I own physical silver and manage a company engaged in silver exploration.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nSilver traded today at 18 months high.\n\nJohn Lee, CFA\n\nExecutive Chairman, Prophecy Development Corp.\n\n[email protected]\n\nAbout John Lee, CFA\n\nJohn Lee, CFA is an accredited investor with over 2 decades of investing experience in metals and mining equities.

Als er 1994 geboren wird, ist die Welt bereits seit fünf Jahren im World Wide Web. Buterin fängt früh an, selbst zu programmieren. Später schreibt er für einen Blog und wird dafür mit Bitcoins bezahlt. Weil ihm die Digitalwährung jedoch zu viele Schwachstellen hat, entwickelt er seine eigene. Er nennt sie Ethereum. Und er erkennt, dass man mit der Technologie, die hinter Digitalwährungen steckt, sehr viel mehr machen kann. Mit nur 22 Jahren wird Buterin so zum Vorreiter einer neuen Bewegung. Einer Bewegung, die Experten zu Superlativen verleitet. Goldman Sachs spricht vom „Megatrend“, die Bank of England von einer „echten Innovation“. Twitter-Investor Marc Andreessen meint gar: Das sei die größte Erfindung, seit es das Internet gibt.\n\nBlockchain ist die Technologie hinter der Digitalwährung Bitcoins\n\nDie Rede ist von der Blockchain. Das ist die Technologie, die hinter Bitcoins steckt. Und die nun auch jenseits der Digitalwährung zum Einsatz kommen soll. Bislang brauchte jeder, der Geld überweisen wollte, eine Bank. Sie wickelt die Zahlung ab und prüft, ob alle nötigen Daten stimmen. Die Blockchain-Technologie macht jedoch genau dasselbe – nur vollautomatisch, schneller und billiger. Sie ersetzt somit die Bank. Und wie bei der Überweisung funktioniert das auch bei anderen Geschäften. Neben der Bank kann die Blockchain auch den Stromanbieter ersetzen, den Musikkonzern oder den Immobilienmakler. Denn wie man Geld über diese Technologie hin- und herschicken kann, kann man per Blockchain auch Strom, Musik oder Immobilien kaufen und verkaufen – und zwar ohne dass ein Konzern dazwischengeschaltet ist.\n\nVorstellen kann man sich die Blockchain wie eine Art Superdatei. Sie erfasst alle Transaktionen von allen Beteiligten, die über ihr System abgewickelt werden. Das Besondere: Statt auf einem zentralen Server wird sie gleichzeitig auf den Rechnern aller Teilnehmer gespeichert und dort laufend aktualisiert. Die Folge: Statt von einem Großrechner wird die Transaktion von jedem einzelnen Computer überprüft, der ans Netzwerk angeschlossen ist. Wissen und Verantwortung werden also an Maschinen delegiert und geteilt. Manipulation soll auf diese Weise kaum möglich sein. Denn Kriminelle müssten sich dazu nicht nur in einen, sondern gleich in alle angeschlossenen Rechner hacken.\n\nDie Blockchain ist ein intelligentes Kassenbuch\n\nWie die Blockchain konkret funktioniert, wird am Beispiel der Geldüberweisung klar: Will Person A Geld an Person B transferieren, werden diese Daten verschlüsselt an sämtliche Rechner im Netzwerk übertragen. Die Rechner gleichen die Daten automatisch mit den Informationen ab, die bereits in der Blockchain gespeichert sind. Sie prüfen zum Beispiel, ob das Konto, von dem Person A Geld überweisen will, tatsächlich A gehört. Geben alle Rechner ihr Okay, wird die Transaktion durchgeführt und als Information der Superdatei hinzugefügt. Diese Superdatei ist also nichts anderes als eine ellenlange Kette (Chain), der immer wieder neue Informationen (Blocks) hinzugefügt werden. So entsteht ein riesiges, intelligentes Kassenbuch.\n\nDass manche die Entdeckung der Blockchain als Revolution beschreiben, liegt daran, dass sie Aufgaben übernimmt, von denen man bislang glaubte, für sie eigene Institutionen zu brauchen. Doch mit der Blockchain benötigt man eben keine Bank mehr, um Geld zu überweisen. Man braucht auch keine Börse mehr, um Aktien zu kaufen. Keinen Notar, um ein Testament zu vollstrecken – stattdessen wird den Erben das Geld automatisch überwiesen. Selbst Tech-Firmen, die erst in den letzten Jahren entstanden sind, würden überflüssig. Man bräuchte kein Uber, um einen Taxifahrer zu finden. Keine Firma wie Airbnb, um Mieter und Vermieter von Ferienwohnungen zusammenzubringen.\n\nBanken forschen auch selbst an der Technologie\n\nDer Gedanke, dass man für all diese Geschäfte keine Helfershelfer mehr braucht, sondern nur eine schlaue Superdatei, ist zunächst verstörend. Die Deutsche Bank spricht von einem Paradigmenwechsel. Denn nimmt man die Blockchain ernst, muss man Wirtschaft neu denken. So glauben die Wirtschaftsprüfer von Deloitte auch, dass es weniger eine Frage der Technik ist, ob sich die Blockchain durchsetzt. Stattdessen hänge es zu 80 Prozent davon ab, ob Menschen bereit seien umzudenken. Ob sie einer dezentralen Technologie ebenso viel Vertrauen schenken können wie einer zentralen Institution – etwa einer Bank.\n\nDie Geldinstitute nehmen die Blockchain dennoch ernst. Schließlich wären sie die Ersten, deren Service die Technologie zumindest in Teilen überflüssig machen könnte. Bei der Deutschen Bank heißt es: „Die Blockchain-Technologie ist eine der ersten wirklich disruptiven Ideen aus dem Fintech-Bereich.“ Um nicht abgehängt zu werden, forschen die Geldhäuser deshalb selbst an der Technologie. Sie hoffen: Wenn sie als Banken die Blockchain selbst bereitstellen, könnte sie das retten. 42 Großbanken haben sich unlängst zu einem Konsortium zusammengeschlossen, das in New York und London die Blockchain erforscht. Die Firma trägt den unscheinbaren Namen R3. Doch die Liste der Institute, die mitmischen, liest sich wie das Who’s who der Finanzwelt: Neben Deutscher Bank und Commerzbank machen etwa Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays und UBS mit. Auch der IT-Konzern Microsoft ist dabei.\n\nParallel arbeiten fast alle Finanzinstitute an eigenen Blockchain-Projekten. JP Morgan soll zum Beispiel derzeit mit über 2000 Kunden das Hin- und Herschicken von Geld zwischen London und Tokio per Blockchain testen. Citigroup hat eine eigene Digitalwährung namens Citicoin entwickelt, um Zahlungen zu vereinfachen. Die Kreditkartenfirma Visa arbeitet daran, Überweisungen von Migranten in ihre Heimat zu erleichtern – was teure Transferdienste wie Western Union überflüssig machen könnte.\n\nAuch die Energieversorger befassen sich mit der Blockchain\n\nUnd das ist erst der Anfang, denn die Blockchain ist nicht nur etwas für die Finanzindustrie. Neben Banken sind es die großen Energiekonzerne, die sie fürchten. Denn mit der Technologie kann man auch mit Strom handeln – ohne dafür einen Energiekonzern zu brauchen. Dass das funktioniert, haben gerade zwei Amerikaner bewiesen: Einer hat dem anderen per Blockchain Strom verkauft, den er mit einer Solaranlage auf seinem Dach generiert hat. In Berlin arbeitet ein Team der Firma ITB seit Februar bereits an einem ähnlichen Projekt.\n\nAuch die großen Energieversorger befassen sich mit der Blockchain. Vattenfall lädt am Montag dafür Experten nach Berlin ein, um über Anwendungsbeispiele zu sprechen. Manager Claus Wattendrup sagt: „Wenn diese neue Technologie Realität wird, hat sie das Potenzial, die Energiewirtschaft zu revolutionieren.“ Konkurrent RWE will die Blockchain zum Beispiel bei Elektroautos einsetzen. Weil es an den Ladestationen anders als an einer Tankstelle keine Kasse gibt, ist das Bezahlen des Stroms noch immer ein Problem. Meist müssen die Fahrer der Elektroautos extra einen Vertrag mit einem der örtlichen Stadtwerke schließen. Dank der Blockchain-Technologie könnte das sehr viel einfacher gehen: Über einen Chip im Auto könnte das Geld nach dem Tanken einfach automatisch vom Konto abgebucht werden.\n\nButerin träumt von der Software, die alle Welt benutzt\n\nSetzt sich die Blockchain in der Breite durch, wird einer davon besonders profitieren: Vitalik Buterin. Der 22-Jährige hat eine Stiftung gegründet. Die stellt anderen die Technologie bereit, damit sie auf Blockchain-Basis neue Anwendungen entwickeln können. Funktionieren soll das nach dem Vorbild von Apple. Der Konzern hat mit iOS ein Betriebssystem fürs Smartphone entwickelt – und dann andere Programmierer eingeladen, dafür Apps zu erfinden. Wie einst Apple-Gründer Steve Jobs träumt Buterin von der globalen Software, die alle Welt nutzt. Noch hat er einen weiten Weg vor sich.', 'Udost?pnij:\n\nPolub:\n\nBitcoin na dobre sta? si? cz??ci? pejza?u Internetu, a stoj?ca u jego podstaw technologia ?a?cucha bloków (blockchain) znajduje zastosowanie ju? nie tylko w kryptowalutach – do?? powiedzie?, ?e nawet Microsoft przygotowa? ostatnio zestaw narz?dzi dla biznesu, które pozwol? na ?atwe wdra?anie technologii wykorzystuj?cych rozproszone rejestry.

Na najwi?kszej polskiej gie?dzie Bitcurex.com, cena 1 BTC zbli?a si? ju? do 3000 PLN. Czy to kolejna ba?ka spekulacyjna, czy te? potwierdzenie przez rynek realnej warto?ci tej cyfrowej „monety”?\n\nTo najwy?sze notowania od 28 miesi?cy, kiedy to w lutym 2014 roku kurs wymiany si?gn?? tysi?ca dolarów ameryka?skich za bitcoina, by pó?niej gwa?towanie zanurkowa?, wraz z towarzysz?cymi temu jak zawsze deklaracjami mediów o rych?ym ko?cu tej kryptograficznej waluty, przypominaniu historii o cebulkach tulipanów i tym podobnym opowie?ciom. O ile jednak cebulki tulipanów okaza?y si? mie? ograniczon? u?yteczno??, a po p?kni?ciu ich ba?ki w 1637 roku nigdy nie zdo?a?y zbli?y? si? do u?amka warto?ci swojej szczytowej warto?ci, z bitcoinami najwyra?niej jest inaczej. Niezale?nie od aktualnego kursu, ta cyfrowa waluta staje si? coraz bardziej zaawansowana technicznie, a liczba firm akceptuj?cych p?atno?ci w bitcoinach przekroczy?a w zesz?ym roku ju? 100 tysi?cy, w?ród nich s? linie lotnicze (w tym nasz LOT), sklepy z grami (Steam!), platformy blogowe (WordPress!) i wiele innych.\n\nKurs bitcoina do dolara w ostatnich tygodniach, wykres z serwisu cryptowat.ch\n\nTen szybki wzrost warto?ci bitcoinów, który rozpocz?? si? z pocz?tkiem czerwca, nie wzi?? si? tylko ze spekulacji na gie?dach, lecz wydaje si? by? uzasadniony sytuacj? polityczno-ekonomiczn? na ?wiecie, jak równie? kwestiami technicznymi. Oto pi?? czynników, które wydaj? si? najbardziej wp?ywa? obecnie na kurs bitcoina:\n\nr e k l a m a\n\n1. Zmniejszenie o po?ow? nagród dla górników. Obecnie górnicy, czyli podmioty przetwarzaj?ce transakcje w sieci Bitcoin, za rozwi?zanie kolejnego bloku z transakcjami otrzymuj? sta?? nagrod? w wysoko?ci 25 BTC (plus skromne prowizje z op?at za transakcje).

Przypominamy, ?e finalnie na ?wiecie b?dzie 21 mln bitcoinów, a do tej pory wydobyto ich ponad 15,6 mln.\n\n2. Rosn?ca popularno?? rozproszonych rejestrów finansowych. Na Wall Street terminy takie jak „blockchain” i „distributed ledger” sta?y si? modne, a warto?? firm z sektora FinTech, oferuj?cych takie rozwi?zania bankom i gie?dom, w ci?gu roku wzros?a kilkukrotnie. Pojawiaj? si? te? ci?gle nowe pomys?y na wykorzystanie ?a?cucha bloków, np. do zabezpieczenia cyfrowych praw dystrybucji mediów czy zapisywania za ich pomoc? publicznych ksi?g wieczystych. Wszystko to tworzy pozytywn? atmosfer? wokó? najwi?kszego i najcenniejszego dzi? z rozproszonych rejestrów, czyli ?a?cucha bloków sieci Bitcoin.\n\n3. Brak silnego konkurenta dla bitcoina. To prawda, w ostatnich miesi?cach sporo si? mówi?o o kryptograficznej, programowalnej walucie Ethereum, ale wczoraj mogli?my przekona? si?, na jak kruchych nogach st?paj? inne kryptowaluty. Jeden skuteczny atak hakerski na organizacj? DAO, zbudowan? wokó? Ethereum funkcjonuj?cego w niej jako programowalne akcje, pozwoli? na wykradzenie równowarto?ci ponad 50 mln dolarów, drastycznie obni?aj?c warto?? Ethereum i zaufanie inwestorów. Druga wa?na kryptograficzna waluta, Litecoin, pod wzgl?dem innowacyjno?ci tak wiele na rynek nie wnosi, na zawsze chyba b?dzie skazana na bycie „srebrem dla bitcoinowego z?ota”.\n\n4. L?k przed Brexitem. Wielu analityków finansowych zauwa?a, ?e na dobry kurs bitcoina wp?ywa coraz wi?ksze prawdopodobie?stwo wyj?cia Wielkiej Brytanii ze struktur Unii Europejskiej. Niepewno?? wzgl?dem tego, co stanie si? z walutami europejskimi po Brexicie zach?ca inwestorów do poszukiwania takich form inwestycji, które b?d? odporne na rozmaite dziwne pomys?y w?adz (pami?tamy, co sta?o si? z oszcz?dno?ciami ludzi, którzy trzymali swoje pieni?dze w bankach Cypru).\n\n5. Niepewno?? co do dalszych losów chi?skiej gospodarki. Mi?dzynarodowy Fundusz Walutowy zaczyna otwarcie mówi? o zagro?eniu ze strony gwa?townie rosn?cych d?ugów korporacyjnych Chin, które mog? wywo?a? systemowy kryzys gospodarczy. Ju? dzi? szacuje si? je na 145% chi?skiego PKB, tymczasem w?adze Chin niewiele robi?, by to zmieni?, i to z ca?kiem prostego powodu: bez nieustannego stymulowania gospodarki w ten sposób niebawem odnotuj? znaczne spowolnienie. W najlepszym razie Pekin zamierza po prostu pozwoli? upa?? instytucjom finansowym, które przesadzi?y z nierozs?dnymi po?yczkami. A trzeba pami?ta?, ?e Chi?czycy maj? spore oszcz?dno?ci – i w obecnej sytuacji intensywnie poszukuj? alternatyw do inwestowania. Gie?dy kryptowalut, g?ównie bitcoinów i litecoinów, odnotowa?y w ostatnich miesi?cach wzrost wp?ywów chi?skiego renminbi o kilkadziesi?t procent.\n\nIle wi?c ostatecznie mia?by kosztowa? 1 bitcoin? Zapewne na 3 tysi?cach z?otych si? nie sko?czy, sytuacja jest daleko inna, ni? dwa lata temu. Mamy ju? gwarancj? Europejskiego Trybuna?u Sprawiedliwo?ci, ?e bitcoin nie mo?e by? obj?ty podatkiem VAT. Sama bran?a znacznie ulepszy?a te? procedury samoregulacyjne. Przyk?adowo, jak ustalili?my, we wspomnianym Bitcurexie dzia?a dzi? wydzielony zespó? Compliance, tak jak w ka?dej du?ej instytucji finansowej – gwarantuj?c zgodno?? z regu?ami AML (przeciwko praniu brudnych pieni?dzy) oraz KYC (weryfikacji to?samo?ci klienta), na poziomie, który zadowala banki.', 'We are near the end of the mandated period for Ticketmaster to notify beneficiaries of a $400 million class action settlement reached last month. And since the settlement applies to anyone who purchased tickets on Ticketmaster’s website between October 21st, 1999 and February 27th, 2013 – a group that totals around 50 million people—there’s a good chance you’re a lucky winner.\n\nOr, to be more precise, a lucky victim. The suit, Curt Schlesinger et al. v. Ticketmaster, claimed that Ticketmaster’s fees during the period were deceptive and misleading. Specifically, Ticketmaster’s Order Processing Fee and UPS delivery fees were found to be unrelated to the actual costs of those services, but merely, as described by the firm administering the claim, “profit generators.”\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThe involvement of UPS shipping for tickets hints at just how old this litigation is—the suit was initially filed more than a decade ago.\n\nThough the settlement’s small-dollar rebates initially inspired some ire, it looks like class members will also be getting free vouchers for tickets—one pair per purchase during the settlement period. The tickets will be good for shows at venues owned or operated by LiveNation, which merged with Ticketmaster in 2010. Both vouchers and tickets should be reflected automatically in the Ticketmaster/LiveNation accounts of eligible customers.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how useful the free ticket vouchers will really be, though. They’ll only be redeemable, according to Billboard, if class members don’t redeem their discount codes in sufficient numbers in the coming year. Even when they’re activated, the tickets will only be good for a limited selection of events, though the settlement requires that they cover 60% of events in LiveNation operated amphitheaters.\n\nFor more on Ticketmaster, watch our video.\n\nAs Slate previously reported, even this modest, complicated payout may be among the last of its kind. Companies have overwhelmingly adopted the practice of including arbitration clauses their terms of use agreements with customers, prohibiting them from pursuing restitution through the court system. Ticketmaster itself implemented such a clause in 2011.\n\nThe impact of the settlement (which you can read here) on future customers isn’t exactly mind-blowing. When Ticketmaster charges a processing fee from here on out, it merely has to inform customers that it “may include a profit” for the company.']"
06/19/2016,"[""Griff Green, a spokesman for Slock.it, the team which founded the DAO, says in an interview with CoinTelegraph that he is privy to some of the pool operator’s discussions and they “very much back the soft fork.”\n\nHowever, he doubts pool operators are willing to go on record and publicly support the fork.\n\nResponding to potential suggestions of negotiation with the attacker, Green stated:\n\n“I'm not personally open to negotiations because with a hard fork we can get all of the ETH back to the people who were attacked.”\n\nHe further added: “I think there is a general consensus in the Ethereum community that a soft fork is easy” and “[t]he Ethereum community has banded together to make this happen.”\n\nWe have received only one response from pool operators, Dwarfpool, which, in reply to our question on whether they support the fork proposed by Vitalik Buterin, Dwarfpool’s Admin stated: “We are still learning about DAO incident.”\n\nIn providing a time estimate of when we are to expect the fork to merge and activate, Green stated:\n\n“The code is written and being tested as we speak for multiple clients including the geth client which is the one used by 85% of the miners (or more). Parity was the first to do it and Gavin Wood has been working tirelessly to make this all right. I estimate a few days or a week.”\n\nThe Ethereum community is running to a tight deadline following one of the biggest hacks in the digital currency space. A recursive call bug was exploited to appropriate 3.6 million ethereum, sending the price crashing down by almost 50% for Ethereum and almost 70% for the DAO.\n\nVitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, proposed a soft fork to freeze the DAO to be followed by a hardfork to send all the funds to a new contract address where token holders can withdraw their balance.\n\nGreen states:\n\n“The hard fork would fix this completely without affecting the rest of the ecosystem, the Ethereum blockchain chain is structured differently then Bitcoin's; we do not have to undo unrelated transactions. Since no ETH that the DAO received ever exited the system of DAOs that were created (a genius security precaution by Christoph Jentzsch) the DAO Token Holders would be able to get back their stolen funds without affecting the rest of the ecosystem one iota.”\n\nOpinion is split on the fork proposal, with 52% of 600 polled CoinTelegraph readers stating they in favour and 48% against. To sway opinion, the alleged DAO attacker has stated that he will offer miners one million ether through a smart contract to oppose the fork.\n\nHowever, the majority of ethereans seem resolute in backing Buterin and the wider etherean development community in what will most likely be a defining moment for Ethereum and an event that will shape its future.\n\nGriff Green Fails to Take Responsibility in Full Interview Transcript\n\nThe following interview took part yesterday with Griff Green, a spokesman for Slock.it, the team that founded the DAO. Any modifications are only cosmetic.\n\nAndrew Quentson (AQ): Hi, any update? Have you/eth devs entered into any negotiations with the hacker?\n\nGriff Green: Nope. Philisophically I believe all criminals were victims first and we (Slock.it) are looking for solutions. Not more victims.\n\nAQ: What sort of offer would you make them?\n\nGG: I'm not personally open to negotiations because with a hard fork we can get all of the ETH back to the people who were attacked.\n\nAQ: I've emailed some pool operators, not sure if or when they'll respond. Do they back the fork?\n\nGG: I am privy to some of their discussions and they for the most part are taking a calm analytical approach. They very much back the soft fork and will talk about the hard fork over the next week.\n\nAQ: They willing to go on record?\n\nGG: I doubt it. But I think there is a general consensus in the Ethereum community that a soft fork is easy.\n\nAQ: Any time estimate for the soft fork upgrade?\n\nGG: The code is written and being tested as we speak for multiple clients including the geth client which is the one used by 85% of the miners (or more). Parity was the first to do it and Gavin Wood has been working tirelessly to make this all right. I estimate a few days or a week. The Ethereum community has banded together to make this happen. After that the hard fork discussion will continue.\n\nAQ: You taking any action to protect the remaining ether?\n\nGG: Our security guys, Lefteris and Colm are working with some Curators and community members to make sure that if the DAO starts leaking funds again they will be recoverable, but in the interest of security for their operation that's all I can say. Sorry I'm on a train going thru the German countryside my wifi come in and out\n\nAQ: No worries. This was just published, a lot to take in I'm sure, but once you read it, what are your comments on it?\n\nGG: I didn't read it but I would not be surprised to see people wanting to take credit for the heist.\n\nAQ: I know you're still trying to resolve the situation, but what do you honestly and genuinely think went wrong?\n\nGG: The hard fork would fix this completely without affecting the rest of the ecosystem, the Ethereum blockchain chain is structured differently then Bitcoin's; we do not have to undo unrelated transactions.\n\nSince no ETH that the DAO received ever exited the system of DAOs that were created (a genius security precaution by Christoph Jentzsch) the DAO Token Holders would be able to get back their stolen funds without affecting the rest of the ecosystem one iota.\n\nI gotta go. Thx for the chance to answer some awesome questions.\n\nAQ: I believe you claimed there was an audit.\n\nOk, just wanted to ask, I mean I can tomorrow as well, but many people are criticising the slock.it team, what do you have to say to them?\n\nAQ asked earlier today “[J]ust wondered if you wished to answer those last three questions?”, but has not received a response."", ""The June 2016 edition of the IMF's quarterly magazine, Finance & Development, features a very pro-blockchain article called “The internet of Trust,” which explains Bitcoin in great detail, expanding on the benefits of the blockchain impressively.\n\nReminiscent of The Economist's iconic twin articles from October last year titled “The Trust Machine” and “The great chain of being sure about things,” this new article makes perfectly clear the benefits and disruptive properties of an immutable ledger system.\n\nThis time, however, the article is from the IMF itself. Andreas Adriano, the Senior Communications Officer in the IMF’s Communications Department, and Hunter Monroe, a Senior Economist in the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department, together wrote the four-page comprehensive report.\n\n- Adriano and Monroe\n\nBeing careful to cover the benefits of the technology without ignoring the highly disruptive nature of it to their industry required a lot of care. The duo effectively explained what the technology does without getting too technical, and all of the damaging implications that blockchain could have for their own industry were fully exposed.\n\n- Adriano and Monroe\n\nThroughout the article, the authors referred primarily to Bitcoin itself, and had a good grasp on what makes bitcoin's token valuable. “Completing the block for a period requires some computational work,” they explained, “with a reward in bitcoin—so the people competing to complete blocks are called “miners.” Thus bitcoin, by combining a peer-to-peer approach with cryptographic security, became the first successful digital currency, after several decades of failures,” the authors concluded, showing why bitcoin works as a currency, not just a blockchain.\n\nImage from the IMF magazine article depicting a blockchain replacing banks and even the central bank too.\n\nThe authors then made the case that suggests blockchains will be beneficiary and bitcoin will not likely become a competitor to banks. “Created to avoid banks,” the article's subheading reads, “bitcoin’s blockchain technology may end up helping them.” Several interviews from executives were referenced in the article, all with the opinion that banks are in no danger from bitcoin.\n\n- Adriano and Monroe\n\nFinance & Development, the half-century-old magazine with global distribution that the report is featured in was produced and published by the IMF directly, and it primarily explores issues of monetary policy and economic development. For the quarterly magazine to feature an article about Bitcoin and blockchains makes evident their importance to international monetary policy.\n\nThe IMF itself has already hinted at the importance of digital currencies before. In January, IMF Director Christine Lagarde made a presentation titled “Virtual Currencies and Beyond: Initial Considerations,” at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The invitation-only annual meeting brings together world leaders from the 189 member countries, and CEOs from its 1,000 member firms, as well as selected representatives from academia, NGOs, religious leaders, and the media.\n\nLagarde presented her paper during a panel called “Transformation of Finance.” Her speech and the accompanying document provided an overview of virtual currencies, how they work, and how they fit into monetary systems, both domestically and internationally.\n\n- Christine Lagarde, IMF Managing Director\n\nAlthough most of her report dealt with proposed regulation and policy changes that would be needed to accommodate digital currencies, madame Lagarde did not shy away from them altogether, taking the time to point out examples of their benefits.\n\nRemittances, land and credit registries, payment and settlement infrastructure for transactions in existing currencies, securities, and other assets that would all be improved with the use of blockchains were among many of the examples she listed. “Virtual currencies' technologies hold promise of greater financial inclusion and lower remittances costs,” Lagarde stated in her speech.\n\nThe IMF isn't the only senior financial institution talking about blockchain adoption lately. Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen recently held a fintech event and encouraged her fellow central bankers to accelerate their studies of new financial technologies, specifically mentioning bitcoin, the blockchain, and other distributed ledgers.\n\nJens Weidmann, the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank and Chairman of the board of Directors at the BIS commented on bitcoin during Bundesbank's annual report this spring too. The President of the Deutsche Bundesbank noted that blockchains are a 'key innovation.'\n\n- Jens Weidmann, Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Bank for International Settlements\n\nHe doesn't sound as enthusiastic about Bitcoin, however, calling it and other digital currencies a 'challenge.' “I can also well imagine that it will soon be possible to use digital currencies, such as bitcoins, which are based on this technology,” he continued, “to trade in financial products, such as shares, bonds or derivatives in decentralised systems. This would, of course, present a challenge for the existing payment and settlement systems.”\n\nThere can no longer be any doubt that the top organizations and offices in the world that Bitcoin could disrupt are fully aware of it and how it works. However, with the warm reception from the IMF, and overall positive opinion of blockchains industry-wide, it appears that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been given a pass and granted more time to grow before resistance is formed."", 'Quoine, a Singapore-based Bitcoin exchange, has closed a $20 million funding round led by JAFCO, leveraging off the large opportunity for Bitcoin in the Japanese market, with participation from venture capitalists (VCs) and other strategic investors.\n\nIn addition to the funding, the company has appointed Ken Mazzio as head of compliance and information security. Its last funding round was a $2 million angel investment in December 2014.\n\nThe latest investment will see it shift its headquarters to Tokyo from Singapore. The Singapore office will remain as a subsidiary.\n\nMike Kayamori, co-founder and CEO of Quoine, in an interaction with Bitcoin.com, explained that it would continue to maintain an Asian focus, given that Asia trading exceeded expectations.\n\nThis is part of a series of investments closed by Japanese bitcoin exchanges this year. bitFlyer closed a $27 million investment in April 2016 and Zaif raised $6.5 million in May 2016.\n\nThis pattern in funding, with increasing involvement in bitcoin investment by corporates, is reflective of how all of 2015?s largest blockchain and bitcoin deals involved corporates and strategics, with 2016 maintaining this trend. This comes at a time when financial institutions and corporates are grappling with the association between bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nAlso Read: India: Bitcoin wallet startup Zebpay raises $1m Series A funding\n\nBitcoin prices to hit roof in 2016 with slower growth in money supply\n\nThe Bitcoin scene\n\nBitcoin is a decentralised digital asset, digital commodity money and payments system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. It operates via peer-to-peer (P2P) networks in a manner similar to the BitTorrent network. In terms of transactions, users are pseudo-anonymous and can make transactions securely and at little cost in a minimal amount of time.\n\nIt is strongly deflationary, given that the supply of bitcoins is finite and capped at 21 million bitcoins. Inflationary until this hard cap, growing adoption will see bitcoins preserve their value relative to fiat currencies, where increases in money supply lead to inflation that devalues them and decreases their purchasing power.\n\nLaunched in June 2015, the bitcoin exchange taps on the potential of Japan for cryptocurrencies and bitcoin. The third largest economy in the world and second largest in the Indo-Asia Pacfic, the Pacific island state has introduced regulations for bitcoin exchanges, in a bid to regulate and legitimise trading in the cryptocurrency.\n\nLate last year, the European Union’s Court of Justice ruled that bitcoin exchange transferring conventional currencies such as euros or Swedish krona into bitcoin for a fee are exempt from value-added taxes.\n\nThis will have a net positive effect on the crytpcurrency sector as a whole, as this will see cryptocurrencies digitally transferred and used as means of payment for goods and services with Japan legitimately and will see a reduction in the rate of casualty in the market caused by fraud due to strict law and regulation in the market.\n\nIn an interview with The Japan Times, former CEO and current President, Mario Gomez Lozada stated: “When we thought about it, Japan is the third-biggest economy in the world, huge economy, huge market . . . nobody was really tapping that market from a bitcoin perspective.”\n\nWhile it may take time to build a customer base, Lozada is confident of attracting Japanese consumers to Quione, as he states it is built based on his experience ad knowledge of working with traditional banking systems. In fact, much of the core management team have worked with the likes of Merrill Lynch, UBS, Credit Suisse, HSBC and SoftBank.\n\nA core part of bitcoin is the blockchain, a core technology that function as an public ledger that recorded every transaction of the currency since inception. In an interaction with DEALSTREETASIA, Kayamori commented that he foresaw banks automating through the public ledger via the use of smart contracts.\n\nSpeaking on the topic of the digitisation of currencies and how regional currencies could develop, Kayamori shared with DEALSTREETASIA: “The Euro was an excellent thesis, but the implementation was wrong. Each country cannot control their own money flow. The global currency is the Bitcoin cryuptocurrency and it’s driven by supply and demand, much like other fiat currencies.”\n\nWith the bitcoin network maintained by miners – who use extremely powerful computers checking on whether people are attempting to alter the records kept by the blockchain – who are incentivised by the receipt of bitcoins as a reward for keeping the ledger accurate – this enables it to operate as a legitimate and decentralised currency platform without a central authority, given its ‘trustless’ nature.\n\nIncreasingly, many large financial services firms and institutions, as well as large corporate strategic investors, are focusing their attention on bitcoin and the associated blockchain technologies.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin can be risky business in India: Nilam Doctor, GreenCoinX\n\nDanish co Coinify teams up with Bitcoin Vietnam to launch blockchain payment processing platform\n\nCurrent trends\n\nWhile noted for its high volatility in its early days, particularly in the 2013/2014 period, bitcoin has since stabilised as it matures, arguably becoming as stable as gold.\n\nIn a NASDAQ opinion piece, former FX trader and finance journalist Martin Tiller opines: “As I said, I still believe that we are in a disruptive period for Bitcoin in a positive way. The increase in projects using blockchain-like systems is bringing some reasoned coverage and many more are beginning to understand what bitcoin is and how it can be a force for good.”\n\n“The price of bitcoin really doesn’t matter much when it is viewed from an historical perspective, nor is a drop to $300 an existential threat. The volatility that we are seeing, however, when taken as a whole, could easily steer bitcoin away from what I believe to be its true function, that of a currency rather than an investment,” Tiller concluded.\n\nElaborating on Japan’s investment space, in his interaction with Bitcoin.com, Kaymori highlighted how online currency trading, store loyalty point cards and mobile game tokens were popular forms of speculative investment in Japan. When coupled with deflation and a cultural aversion to investing in stock markets and funds, Japanese retail investors tend towards investing in the forex markets.\n\n“From a liquidity and volume perspective, I think Japan is going to be larger than China. When you look at retail FX, you don’t need any explanation. Japan’s retail FX liquidity already dwarfs any other country in the world,” said Kayamori,\n\nMindful of this, Quoine is adopting a business-to-business (B2B) trajectory that will see it position itself as an “exchange for exchanges” offering liquidity to established brokerages. These brokerages will be able to explore and leverage on the possibilities presented by cryptocurrency trading for further revenue growth.\n\nIn statements to DEALSTREETASIA in relation to the investment, Kurt Hanson, an angel investor in Quoine, said, “The $20 million in new investment is a vote of confidence in Quoine. With the funds I’m looking forward to seeing the company greatly accelerate and expand its business in Asia and taking bitcoin mainstream. I see Quoine continuing its amazing growth over the next 5 years, especially in the remittance market of developing countries of Asia.”\n\nHanson continued, “And the company is working on what it calls Banking 3.0, which will turn it into a virtual bank available to one and all – sort of the Uber and AirBnb of banks. The bitcoin market will continue to grow at a slow and steady pace, the challenge will be to convince the average consumer that bitcoin will be of benefit to them.”\n\nAlso Read:\n\nBitcoin has a governance problem, no matter who created it\n\nBitcoin finds room in small funds; large institutions still on sidelinesSTORY\n\nIceland’s Genesis launches first bitcoin mining fund\n\nFiverr secures $60m Series D investment, to integrate Bitcoin in payments\n\nCan Singapore lead the Bitcoin evolution in Asia ?\n\nSingapore-based Bitcoin brokerage Coin Republic acquired by Mexico’s meBXT', 'Jane Wild JUNE 20, 2016 2 It is a technology so new that many people in finance cannot explain what it is or what it might be able to do — yet they know they might have to worry about it. Demand from professionals for learning about blockchain, the technology that powers the virtual currency bitcoin, is so great that Cambridge university plans to offer courses to executives about its disruptive potential this year. Blockchain has been the subject of a significant amount of hype over the past year as institutions ranging from banks, exchanges, insurers and governments have rushed to work out how blockchain could be used, by them or rivals. The technology deployed is known as a distributed database, which runs from many computers and needs no central authority. Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finance, based at its Judge Business School, will be the first in the UK to teach the subject, with demand coming mainly from employees of global banks. “Nobody wants to be Kodak,” says Robert Wardrop, executive director of the school’s centre for alternative finance, comparing the film-maker’s failure to adapt to the digitisation of photography to the change in the banking sector. “They [bankers] all know their industry is being digitalised, how you develop a competitive response\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that is the challenge,” Mr Wardrop says. “Do you do nothing, collaborate or compete?” Advocates believe that though blockchain is at an early stage in its development, it has the potential to disrupt many sectors. This is because it is transparent, indelible and tamper-proof and is jointly run by several parties. It could be used to keep records such as on a person’s complete health or insurance history, for example. Or it could be used for cross-border clearing and settlement. Cambridge’s teaching about blockchain and digital currencies will be a core part of its educational programme on fintech, which is being developed by the Centre for Alternative Finance. Professors will also cover peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, alternative investments and new forms of credit analytics. The material will be included in the university’s master of finance programme this summer. The introduction of the Cambridge course comes after several US universities that had added bitcoin to their syllabuses in 2014 shifted their attention to blockchain. David Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, says there is great interest in the quandaries posed by emerging technology to regulators. “There are huge challenges for most governments around the world because they assume the current law will deal with a lot of blockchain issues,” he says. “But it is a totally different animal.” Professor Yermack predicts that a technological evolution will shrink the size of the industry’s workforce overall, but in doing so it will create many specialist tech jobs. [Bankers] all know their industry is being digitalised, Do they do nothing, collaborate or compete? Stern School will teach its MBA students about digital currencies, blockchains and their growing place in the financial services industry from next spring. It also plans a course for executives. At Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, emphasis has also shifted away from bitcoin. Duke says its innovation and cryptoventures course, which is part of the MBA, has been heavily oversubscribed and is aimed at students who want to create their own blockchain start-ups. Campbell Harvey, finance professor at Fuqua, says: “Now it’s the general technology called blockchain. There are apps that go with it, bitcoin is one of them.” Universities are mostly teaching the basics of blockchain: the context of how the technology came about, its mechanics and how people are trying to commercialise and innovate with it. Garrick Hileman, who teaches blockchain and virtual currencies at Cambridge, says that for more than two years he has seen “tremendous” interest from companies. He has been called in to teach executives informally about bitcoin and other virtual currencies such as ether, and more recently, blockchain. “Many people are still trying to understand the basics,” he says. Blockchain’s reputation has suffered from its association with bitcoin, which has been tarnished by the collapse of Mt Gox — a prominent exchange, with the disappearance of $500m worth of customers’ bitcoins — and the closure by US authorities of the Silk Road website, which facilitated the sale of illegal drugs. But part of what attracted executives to the potential of distributed databases was seeing how well bitcoin performed as it attracted users around the world. Launched in 2008, bitcoin’s market value now stands at more than $10bn, according to Coindesk, which tracks bitcoin data. While the new Cambridge course will teach key concepts — such as what blockchain is and how it is being experimented with — it will not go in depth into the complex cryptographic processes that would be more suited to a computer science course. Manfred Alfonso Dasenbrock, an executive at Brazilian co-operative Sicredi, who attended a fintech course at Cambridge in September, says: “The way we do banking business will not be the same in a few years.” Sign up to the weekly Business School email One-Click Sign Up  to Business School', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

As the Brexit vote approaches, China’s woes are heavily weighing down markets, and socialist regimes failing daily investors worldwide are discovering the cryptocurrency’s value. Very well known economists and researchers are discovering Bitcoin’s potential to be a top asset for the future up there with gold, bonds, fine art, and real-estate.\n\nJust recently economist and author Ed Yardeni has written an investment report for the newspaper Barron’s. The news outlet is a weekly publication that covers financial information, market developments, and relevant statistics and is owned by Dow Jones & Company. Yardeni says in his editorial the winning portfolio to have in 2016 is “gold, treasuries and Bitcoin.” The economist explains that “Recent developments in the financial markets have done little to bolster confidence in government-sponsored ‘fiat’ currencies.” However, Yardeni details Bitcoin and gold two assets that live outside the stranglehold of government intervention are seeing significant gains. The Barron’s researcher states in the recent report:\n\n“Research papers are declaring bitcoin a new asset class, while Wall Street and other financial institutions are looking at how they can harness blockchain to cut costs and bolster security. Perhaps most dramatically, people in Africa are digitizing their currency and storing it on their cell phones without ever opening a bank account. We’ve maintained that while Bitcoin attracted much attention, it’s really the technology behind the currency, blocktrade, that has the potential to have a more wide-ranging impact on the financial markets. Banks and brokers have begun looking at how blocktrade could be harnessed to track trades and lower trading costs.”\n\nBarron’s isn’t the only financial publication writing about Bitcoin’s potential. According to the trading magazine, The Street, Bitcoin will rally with other investments such as SolarCity and the Swiss Franc. Alongside this, a recent report from Coinbase and ARK Investment Management LLC (Ark Invest) also has called Bitcoin a new asset class to watch. The paper written by Ark Invest’s, Chris Burniske, and Coinbase’s, Adam White, details the many properties Bitcoin has as a new investment opportunity like no other. In “Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New Asset Class” the two co-authors say:\n\n“Bitcoin exhibits characteristics of a unique asset class—meeting the bar of investability, and differing substantially from other assets in terms of its politico-economic profile, price independence, and risk-reward characteristics.”\n\nAs well as Ark Invest’s report, The Street, and Barron’s editorials the financial markets and investment publication Market Watch has also explained Bitcoin as a top hedge in this turbulent economy. In a report written on June 17 in Market Watch called “Bitcoins are the best investment in my retirement account” author Jack Tatar is pleased with his investment in the cryptocurrency at the moment. The writer explains the road the digital currency has traveled throughout his portfolio investment and in the end, he notes it has been successful. Author Jack Tatar writes:\n\n“Six months into 2016, I’m reporting back to you that, as of this writing, Bitcoin is over $700, and GBTC is trading over $100 a share. It has clearly been the best investment in my retirement account. Do I wish that I bought more? I based my initial investment on an allocation as an alternative investment in my portfolio and thus a smaller position that my equity holdings, so I’m content that these returns came within the context of, what I consider was based on a prudent asset-allocation strategy. At this point, the time has come to finally declare that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be considered investment options for investors.”\n\nThese types of reports can be found in a wide array of investment publications at the moment as venture capitalists and investors see Bitcoin’s worth as an asset class. Even Investopedia writes, “Further, the rising demand for alternatives to fiat money continues to bring Bitcoin under the spotlight. Unlike gold, the other popular alternative to government controlled legal tender, Bitcoin can be transferred globally in minutes, with no intermediaries. After a positive and relatively stable 2015, the virtual currency stands on a stronger footing in 2016.”\n\nThis type of research and reviewing is clearly “ringing the bell” in investment-land as legitimate, well-known economists and investors explain in greater detail the attributes of the new cryptocurrency asset class.\n\nOne thing is for certain is investors are reading these well-known publications opinions and are learning about the new asset class of the 21st century.\n\nSources: Ark Invest, Barron’s, Money Watch, The Street, and Investopedia\n\nImages: Barron’s, Ark Invest, Money Watch, Investopedia, and Pixabay', ""Gabrielle Patrick is a UK and US lawyer specializing in cryptofinance and distributed ledger technology. She is the co-founder and general counsel of Epiphyte, a startup enabling instant settlement of trades and transactions using distributed ledgers.\n\nIn this feature, Patrick discusses the balancing act regulators face in such a fast-changing technological environment, and describes the issues raised at a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on the subject this week.\n\nToday, regulators face the challenge of delicately balancing innovation enablement and avoiding premature and overly burdensome regulation.\n\nOn the one hand, they are expected to ensure market stability and ensure public trust and confidence, yet on the other they are being asked to spur innovation.\n\nThis all comes at a time when technology is advancing much faster than laws can adapt and when the bitcoin blockchain network offers a fundamental shift in how we transact value instantaneously and how money supply management can be improved.\n\nThe opportunity for regulators seems clear: an ability to regulate with enhanced transparency, with access to the best data in real time with regulatory features built into the infrastructure itself (eg: monitoring transaction flow end to end in real time with built-in settlement and compliance functionality).\n\nSo why aren't regulators jumping at this opportunity?\n\nRegulators’ questions\n\nEpiphyte was invited to address 25 central banks at the ECB this week to discuss the FinTech impact on payment and settlement systems, and the regulation of digital innovations. The discussion was dominated by the impact of the bitcoin blockchain network.\n\nSome of the topics raised were:\n\nthe pros and cons of closed loop vs permissioned and open distributed ledgers\n\ncross-border flows and how to avoid systemic risk if adoption of bitcoin significantly increases\n\nglobal blockchain standards and ensuring that all proprietary systems are built with interoperability\n\nthe scalability of the bitcoin blockchain network and liquidity\n\nresource savings using distributed ledgers, resource intensity of maintaining multiple databases and using distributed ledgers as an enhanced sharing mechanism\n\nthe lack of incentive of large banks to progress instant settlement solutions\n\ncapital efficiency and reduction of (capital, market and counterparty) risk.\n\nInstant settlement solutions\n\nFocus was also placed on settlement cycles versus assets using the blockchain. Presumably, if using the network, the settlement cycle is significantly reduced. This would not require regulatory change, but a change in settlement asset, such as bonds issued on a distributed ledger, would trigger a regulatory change.\n\nAnother major point raised was the premature exposure of systemically fundamental systems to distributed ledgers.\n\nSince central banks must rely on mature and resilient systems, the introduction of base money on a distributed ledger at this time may be premature.\n\nDigital identification\n\nPerhaps one of the most interesting discussions was on identification and the need to address digital ID as part of the essential fabric of an evolved financial services ecosystem.\n\nIn the current system, ID frameworks still remain primarily paper based, and the process of onboarding into the financial services system is riddled with inefficiencies, friction and expense.\n\nA transformation to digital ID is long overdue, taking the Estonian example, whereby an electronic national ID card provides the user with legal picture ID in addition to use for digital signatures and for proof of e-access generally.\n\nAt the ECB meeting, the open-source standard Epiphyte has been developing was also discussed, whereby ID can be ported using a multi-signature key mechanism with different schemes and different layers of access being created for different views of subject data.\n\nWhat about RegTech?\n\nWhile regulatory interest continues worldwide, perhaps regulators should pay more attention to how they can leverage the advantages of distributed ledgers themselves to help firms better understand and manage their risks.\n\nAfter all, RegTech is the new FinTech.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Alongside BOE’s new accelerator program they have also partnered up with PricewaterhouseCoopers to research blockchain innovation.\n\nThe Bank of England is starting to believe in the financial technology revolution taking place around the globe. The recent announcement of a new fintech accelerator program confirms all the rumors of the central bank investing its time into this space. BOE Governor Mark Carney seems to be very interested in the innovative phenomena happening worldwide as central bankers everywhere are hearing about the vast opportunities of blockchain solutions and melding tech together with finance. BOE Governor Mark Carney states in his recent address:\n\n“Our Fintech Accelerator has already carried out initial work in the areas of data anonymisation, cyber security, and distributed ledger technology. Other areas of potential future interest for the accelerator include, finding new ways to structure and analyse large datasets, machine learning, particularly in relation to anomaly detection and pattern recognition and the protection of the Bank’s sensitive data”\n\nThe very same day as BOE’s fintech program announcement, the multinational finance firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) told the world PwC’s Northern Ireland technologies team with collaboration from BOE will work together on a “major project” concerning distributed ledger technology. PwC states it’s “decision to focus on blockchain technology in its Northern Ireland headquarters represents a major step in the firm’s move towards developing and exploiting fintech.” Rob Elsey, Chief Information Officer for the Bank of England, believes the “proof-of-concept” will greatly enhance the central bank’s research of emerging blockchain technology. Elsey states in the announcement:\n\n“With PwC’s support, the Bank’s developers used the latest techniques and software to deliver this POC and have gained further skills that will enable additional rapid Proof of Concepts in the future.\n\nCentral banks lust for learning about cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and financial tech, in general, has become apparent. Live Bitcoin News was one of the first to break the news about Mark Carney taking a liking to distributed ledger technology research. Following Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen getting some education on the subject.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Bitcoin plays a role in this world of privatizing blockchains and so-called central bank coins coming into the mix. Another question is with the current failure of the DAO how many will pull the plug on concepts like Smart contract style blockchains? Investors are starting to realize bitcoin network is reliable, and the most tested blockchain holds weight amongst competitors.

A team of technology players is working with the country’s land registry on a system that could possibly go live this fall, according to Reuters.\n\nChromaWay, a Swedish blockchain company, consulting firm Kairos Future, and telecommunications service provider Telia, have developed “proof of concept” demonstration of how the Swedish land registry would work.\n\nBlockchain Brings Benefits\n\nThe blockchain ledger can allow clearing and settlement on one database that provides an easier-to-use and more reliable system than the existing method.\n\nOnce a buyer and seller agree on a contract, a transaction gets recorded on the blockchain, said Magnus Kempe, director of retail and finance at Kairos Future. All parties to the transaction – the buyer, seller, broker, bank and government – can then track its progress.\n\nThe blockchain could shorten the transaction process, which currently takes months to complete once an agreement is made.\n\nA demonstration is available on the ChromaWay website.\n\nPhase Two Begins\n\nKempe said the process has already been tested with some banks as the project’s first phase. “Now we’re on the second phase of the project where we will test in a full-sized environment,” he said. He said the project could go live in the fall.\n\nMats Snäll, head of development of real estate registration at the Swedish Land Registry, said digital documentation of property transfers allows all parties in a transaction to confirm an agreement with the highest security level.\n\n“Being able to assign pending title deed is also something of value for all parties,” he noted. “Everyone will benefit from this.”\n\nThe parties agreed that the blockchain system is more secure, faster, and far less prone to error than the existing method.\n\nThe blockchain can control and regulate the workflow, the land registry noted, reported arstechnica.co.uk.\n\nAlso read: Ubitquity LLC uses block chain to secure real estate titles\n\nDigital Fingerprint Technology\n\nThe blockchain verifies the document is correct, along with the rules and order of authorization using digital fingerprint technology. Fingerprints are unique for each document, registration and process step, creating a verification that is similar to a human fingerprint.\n\nDigital contracts minimize the risk of registering incorrect information and the inability to secure the title deed and the confirmation from the land registry of the land ownership.\n\n“The proposed solution would make Sweden the front runner in this field,” the land registry noted.\n\nChromaWay specializes in identifying ways to store assets such as property and shares on the blockchain using colored coins.

A new decentralized and autonomous future was promised with smart contracts, DAOs and a sharing economy. People flocked in tens of thousands, raising more than $250 million at its peak to only see it crash and burn.\n\n“There are so many attack vectors some of them cancel each other out” said Emin Gün Sirer weeks prior to the spectacular theft of more than $50 million with the rest up for grabs. In contrast, Stephen Tual, one of the founders of the DAO, stated just days before the hack that the recursive bug “is NOT an issue that is putting any DAO funds at risk.” Praising the team as “blessed” with the “Father of Solidity” acting as an advisor, Tual stated in a post titled “No DAO funds at risk”:\n\n“We promptly circumvented this so-called “recursive call vulnerability” or “race to empty”.”\n\nOne month prior to the crowd sale, Tual posted the results of a DAO audit by “Deja Vu Security” which he praised by stating that “to say the quality of their work is top notch is an understatement.” He concluded:\n\n“[N]o stone was left unturned during those five whole days of security analysis.”\n\nWe now know that many bugs were hiding under many unturned stones. There were warning signs which, with the benefit of hindsight, should have been highlighted more strongly. Particularly the Slock.it proposal, which had as good as no content, with the text presented in a large font size and lacking any numbers.\n\nTheir painting of Zamfir or Sirer as out to get the DAO, or Tual’s and his team’s dismissal of their warning as “a curator going around saying the DAO is broken,” instead of seeking their counsel and taking urgent measures under their direction and in collaboration, should have sent alarm bells.\n\nThey fully dismissed the concerns, responding to our question of what was going on with a meme which read “curators” while ignoring further questions:\n\nThat said, the curators are not without blame. Gavin Wood, resigning as a curator on May the 13th, half-way through the crowdsale with tens of millions raised, stated that “[t]he “curators” are not founders and being a “curator” should not be taken as an endorsement of the DAO.”\n\nSuggesting that at least some may have seen the stellar line up as a comforting sight and may have assumed that the curators had carried out full analysis. Wood admits as much, stating that “the use of the term “curator” is rather misleading” after arguing that his understanding of the role of the curator was limited to only “identity verification primarily because it is autonomous: it needs nothing more!”\n\nWe now know that it needed a lot more and that at least one of the curator had probably not even looked at the code. Responding to Tual criticizing his call for a moratorium, Vlad Zamfir stated:\n\n“After the DAO’s crowd funding event became unexpectedly large and I could no longer ignore it, I started doing due diligence.”\n\nUndoubtedly such due diligence would have assisted prior to the crowdsale, instead of being published a day before it ended. The same, however, can be said of the 20k users who entrusted more than 12 million Ether to a brand new and highly experimental concept in a 30 days frenzy without carrying due diligence. The same can be said of all Ethereans and the wider digital currency ecosystem who said nothing until the sale was over.\n\nIn a way, this was a collective failure and we are all to blame. Some more than others, but, with hindsight, few escape the pointed finger. Although some will accuse the slock.it team of undue motives, it may well be the case that a dream got out of hand and everyone was caught off-guard like a rabbit in the headlights with their primary mistake being a failure to put a cap which turned the project from a slockit DAO to a conceptually completely new and previously unanalyzed semi-decentralized venture capital fund with a bug bounty in the hundreds of millions waiting to be claimed by anyone in the entire world.\n\nThat everyone wanted a part of slockit or the ethereum computer is hardly a mortal sin. That everyone was busy with other projects instead of carrying out audits of the DAO is hardly blameworthy.\n\nBut it is a wake-up call and perhaps it is time that we in the entire digital currency community finally learn the lesson and say: Never Again. That we will not tolerate amateurism with our money. That we expect the highest scrutiny with security audits from acknowledged experts in the digital currency field. That we expect professionalism at all levels, including accountability to the media instead of ignoring tough questions.\n\nWe should take time to reflect on the hard learned lessons and channel any anger that there may be towards building structures for a better future where such things can be avoided by rewarding a professional approach while strongly criticizing any sign of amateurism with our hard earned money.\n\nThe usual way that is done is by the digital currency industry forming a self-regulating body, thus avoiding primary regulations from legislators which, depending on how the situation will be resolved, may now be looking to see whether they should intervene. Such a body would only be advisory, laying down guidelines and scrutinizing projects that request its endorsement, setting audit and disclosure standards. As it would be voluntary, there aren’t many downsides and although it certainly won’t prevent all failures, it may prevent at least some or the more spectacular crash and burns.\n\nThis isn’t 2010 or 2013 anymore. We are on the world stage now with billions on the line. It is time for the entire system to grow up and mature from its toddler years and turn this potential tragedy into an opportunity to build a much stronger ecosystem.\n\nA few M per year for basic research on blockchains seems like a small price now, doesn't it? — Emin Gün Sirer (@el33th4xor) June 17, 2016\n\nImages from Shutterstock and DAO.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:""]"

That move came months after tech publications Gizmodo and Wired published reports in December connecting Wright to the Satoshi identity.\n\nThe story contains a number of interesting facts and anecdotes, including the claim that Wright lost funds in the collapse of Costa Rican digital currency firm Liberty Reserve and once had a face-to-face meeting with Ross Ulbricht, the convicted operator of the Silk Road online dark market. It also offers new details on Dave Kleiman, who was reportedly an early force in the project before passing away in mid-2013.\n\nOne running theme of the story is Wright\'s effort to patent aspects of the technology underlying bitcoin as part of a reported deal with a company called nTrust, which offers a money exchange app and, according to the LBR report, had struck the foundations of a deal that would see the filing of a number of patents related to the blockchain and digital currency under the auspices of a new firm, nCrypt.\n\nThe patent development process appears to have been driven by a desire to sell big – and soon. According to the LBR, ""the hurry for the patents was to help with the giant sale to Google or whomever"".\n\nWork, the story outlines, had already begun at a new research center based in London, and movements toward meetings with Google and Uber had begun, nTrust executives told the publication. O’Hagan spent months working closely with Wright for his story depicting the run-up to the big reveal, and at one point Wright asserts that there had been hundreds of bitcoin and blockchain-patents waiting in the wings.\n\nHe told the publication:\n\n""We have hundreds of patents and papers in progress – research from the beginning – and in the next year we’re going to start releasing them.""\n\nPerhaps most importantly, part of the deal entailed Wright proving that he was actually Satoshi Nakamoto. The company was the driving force behind the process, with nTrust spearheading the effort to source public relations staffers and journalists to manage the reveal.\n\nAs part of the deal, nTrust would settle Wright’s problems with the Australian Tax Office, which had launched an investigation into Wright and his business holdings after he sought business tax credits. In the wake of the December publications, Australian authorities raided his home in the country as part of that investigation.\n\nYet those efforts were scuttled by Wright’s aborted reveal, the LBR report shows. After Wright’s initial reveal sparked broad criticism about the signature details published on his personal blog, the plan shifted to one that would see the alleged bitcoin creator move a stash of early bitcoins from one address to another. Former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen would act as recipient, according to O’Hagan’s report.\n\nThis plan, too, would fall apart, after Wright published a terse, final blog post stating that he would not provide any further evidence to bolster his Satoshi claim. This was reportedly the final blow to any deal between Wright and the nTrust team.\n\nBut a new report from Reuters suggests that the patent effort explored in O’Hagan’s story isn’t finished.\n\nAccording to the news agency, a business venture called EITC Holdings Ltd that is tied to Wright has submitted 50 patent applications in the UK related to digital currencies and blockchain tech, and that it may seek to submit as many as 400 total.\n\nData provided by the UK Intellectual Property Office shows that the EITC has submitted a range of patent applications focused on the technology filed this year, including ones for ""implementing logic gate functionality using a blockchain"", an ""operating system for blockchain IOT devices"" and ""methods and systems for the efficient transfer of entities on a peer-to-peer distributed ledger"".\n\nImage via BBC\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He went on to explain that investors should consider diversifying into bitcoin despite gold’s strong performance so far this year. Unlike gold or fiat currencies, bitcoin isn’t connected to one macroeconomic factor.\n\n“When you look at the global markets, there’s lots of fear, uncertainty and doubts. You’ve got people worrying about the equity markets [and] you’ve got people fleeing into bonds… While gold has had a bit of a run in 2016, over the last five year period it’s been a terrible performing asset,” he said.\n\nOf course, investing in bitcoin isn’t without its own set of risks. Burniske explained the upcoming halving of bitcoin mining rewards on July 9th and the community’s internal debate on how to scale bitcoin. Related to the halving of rewards is the potential risk to the security of bitcoin’s network.\n\n“Part of the concern around the upcoming block award change is that if those miners make less money, then they are less incentivised to throw machinery at the network to secure it,” said Burniske.\n\nBitcoin price today hovered around $740 USD as of 5:17 PM UTC on the CoinDesk BPI exchange, down from yesterday’s close of $764.05.\n\nImage courtesy of ARK Invest', 'More than $19m worth of bitcoin is now being sold at auction in a public sale overseen by professional services firm Ernst & Young.\n\nAnnounced on 30th May, the auction finds E&Y auctioning 24,518 BTC (worth roughly $19m at press time) over a 48-hour period that began at 12:01am AEST today.

Right now, getting any access where you can buy bitcoin without a huge premium is an advantage.”\n\nSources suggested OTC buyers are now paying as much as 2% above market prices, meaning at $748, bitcoins sold off exchanges would be trading at above $760.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has seen rapid appreciation in recent weeks ahead of a long-planned network change called the halving.

If Walmart were to accept Bitcoin it would come at a fitting moment for the company as it drops Visa as a payment method due to the high fees associated with it.\n\nNot only that but in recent weeks the value of Bitcoin has been rising making it almost impossible to ignore the digital currency as an alternative payment method.\n\nEasy Availability\n\nSince Bitcoin came on the scene in 2009, it has grown exponentially with its market cap now larger than the total valuation of Western Union or Twitter.\n\nIts growth has meant that it is now possible for people to purchase bitcoins in storefronts across the country, making it readily available to people who want to use the digital currency as a convenient form of payment.\n\nCanadian decentralized technologies hub, Decentral, announced at the beginning of the year that Canadians will be able to readily purchase the cryptocurrency, enabling those who aren’t tech-savvy to have an easier way of paying for everyday purchases at stores such as Walmart.\n\nBitcoin ATM manufacturer, BitAccess, is another company that is also stepping up to the challenge by revealing that bitcoin can be purchased at 6,000 retail storefronts in Canada, via a Flexepin voucher that works similar to a store card.\n\nAccepting Bitcoin\n\nOf course, what remains to be seen now is what will happen when the number of signatures required has been met. At the time of publishing, there were 64 signatures out of the 100 needed on the Change.org petition.\n\nHowever, if Walmart were to start accepting Bitcoin they would have nothing to lose, and it would help to boost the adoption rate of digital currency in the U.S. and Canada, and will only help to attract positive attention to the digital currency.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The wallet has been developed in partnership with Palo Alto-based blockchain security company BitGo.\n\nAccording to a press release by the company, the wallet will provide a mobile money solution to users in the Caribbean where access to traditional banking is limited. The wallet combines elements of social messaging platforms with remittance via Bitcoin. It allows senders and receivers to chat with each other and also comes with the ability to top-up mobile phones with prepaid minutes anywhere within the Caribbean.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Karsten Becker, CEO of Caricoin, said wallet was developed as an alternative to the traditional banking services for the Caribbean where, according to World Bank 2015 Global Findex Report, nearly 50 percent of the population is unbanked.\n\n“Access to banking services in the Caribbean is difficult at best” Becker said. “The KYC [know-your-customer] process is extremely difficult and antiquated, and out of reach of most people, and the process for small businesses to open a account can take up to 90 days.”\n\nBecker said that unlike traditional banking services where opening an account can take days due to the KYC regulations, the wallet allows anyone to instantly open an account and make digital payments.\n\n“In comparison to banks and the mobile money platforms which are struggling to take off due to over-regulation, we make it extremely easy for anyone to open a account ? all you really need is a mobile phone with an internet connection,” Becker said.\n\nHe also added that the wallet will help users in the rural areas of the Caribbean where people currently have to travel to pay their utility bills by allowing them to pay bills from within the wallet.\n\n“In some areas of rural Jamaica it can cost more than the amount on the utility bill just to travel to go and pay the bill,” Becker said. “Making payments easier without the red tape is just one of the ways our wallet can help people in the Caribbean, something that saves money for both the people and the companies they support with their hard work.”\n\nAdditionally, the company is also working on developing a zero-cost remittance feature to be included in the wallet. According to a world bank report the remittance fees alone in the Caribbean region amount to over $800 million dollars per year.\n\nBy allowing users to easily buy and sell bitcoin from within their wallet this feature will allow members of the Caribbean community working overseas to send money back home without having to incur a remittance fee.The transferred funds can be used to pay utility bills or be cashed out to local currency using bitcoin ATMs.', 'The potential for the technology behind Bitcoin, commonly called blockchain, to transform financial services is becoming somewhat well-known. However, fewer people are aware that the technology could also transform governance to make it more transparent.\n\n“Blockchain has the potential to be the killer app for corruption,” says Tomicah Tillemann, director of the Bretton Woods II Initiative at New America, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that bridges the gap between technology and policy.\n\nFor that reason, New America, blockchain company the Bitfury Group and the non-governmental organization the National Democratic Institute announce today that they have formed the Blockchain Trust Accelerator Initiative, which aims to connect governments with technologists and funders to hasten the adoption of the technology for social good and governance.\n\n“There’s a tremendous amount of capital flowing into blockchain applications in the fintech sector, and that’s fantastic. It’s an indicator of the potential and power of this technology,” says Tillemann, a cofounder of the initiative. “But Bitfury, New America, NDI and all of our partners want to ensure that the transformational potential of the blockchain is used to make people’s lives better in addition to making people money.” (So far, $1.2 billion in venture capital has poured into blockchain startups, with the majority of that going to financial services companies.)\n\nBitfury cofounder and chief executive officer Valery Vavilov said in a statement, “I grew up in Latvia – a small country of roughly two million people that was part of the Soviet Union until 1991 and now is now a proud member of the European union. When I was young I saw members of my family lose so much — their pensions, their life savings, their dreams – all in the face of systems and institutions that were not designed to work for the people. … Blockchain can make the world better and The Bitfury Group is dedicated to doing our part to ensure its success – for everyone.”\n\nNoting that the accelerator will select projects “focused entirely on global change for good,” Tillemann and cofounder Jamie Smith, Bitfury’s global chief communications officer, say potential applications for blockchain in governance include ensuring citizens have access to land titles, tracking the provenance and delivery of vaccines, securing citizens the right to vote, and giving people access to a legal identity.\n\n“The sad truth is that legacy technologies have unfortunately failed in delivering serious solutions to every single one of those challenges,” Tillemann says.\n\nAs an example, a blockchain-based voting system would solve several problems — starting with the fact that it’s time-consuming for many people to even get to a polling place. “That’s time that, if you’re a working mother or an hourly wage earner, is not easy to sacrifice, and in too many instances, individuals without the luxury of a few hours they can dedicate to waiting in line at a voting booth suffer disenfranchisement,” says Tillemann.\n\nSecond, once a vote is cast, citizens of many countries don’t always trust that the vote was recorded accurately or that the central election authority will respect the ballots. But because blockchain technology creates a transparent, immutable ledger, “no government can alter the results of an election without leaving totally transparent evidence of what has happened,” says Tillemann. “The ability to ensure that level of accountability and security in an election process is something the world has never had before.”\n\nSmith adds, “If we are moving in a direction where we will, in the coming years, have global wifi and, undoubtedly, most people will be able to have some type of inexpensive phone, now that there’s this secure system that allows this transaction process, what that means for the future of democracy and good governance is indescribable.”\n\nThe initiative’s first pilot is a land titling system created by Bitfury using blockchain technology in the Republic of Georgia announced in April. Beginning in July, the accelerator, which will establish a board of directors, will begin soliciting proposals through an online portal and vet them for feasibility, partnership opportunities and potential to expand from pilot to broader option. Top proposals will then be matched with governments and funders to begin implementation.\n\nSmith says they will be “reporting out to the world what we’ve learned on various projects to be a resource in what is working and what may not be working so other institutions can piggyback off those efforts.”\n\nThe project has already attracted a fair bit of interest from notable organizations. Among the attendees at the Monday roundtable will be representatives from the White House, the Omidyar Foundation, the AFL-CIO and the Sunlight Foundation, and about 50 organizations are expected. The accelerator plans to have such roundtables monthly and Smith says, “we invite anyone who cares about this type of work to be part of this process.”\n\nThe accelerator was born out of Smith’s and Tillemann’s working relationship over almost 15 years in democracy and governance. Smith has worked for former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, President Obama and Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, and Tillemann for Secretaries Clinton and John Kerry. Tillemann, whose portfolio at the State Department consisted of working with new democracies to help them put in place accountability and good governance systems, says, “In so many countries, the underlying infrastructure they had to wrestle with was so bad, the underlying processes were so bad, that even when you had very well-intentioned officials, it was impossible for them to run efficient, effective, corruption-free institutions.” He realized that “if you could provide a platform that would provide similar levels of efficiency and transparency without the massive investment in infrastructure, you could change the world and the way citizens engage with the state. And the more I learned about blockchain, the more I realized that it was that system.”\n\nPlans for the accelerator were finalized at the recent 2016 Blockchain Summit on Sir Richard Branson’s Necker Island in the Caribbean.\n\nBitfury started as a company focused on Bitcoin mining and chip manufacturing but has recently expanded to blockchain services, beginning with the land titling project and now the accelerator. Smith says the company’s work with blockchain will be focused on governance and social good.\n\nUpdate 12:48pm EST June 20, 2016: The amount of venture capital invested into Bitcoin and blockchain startups is $1.2 billion, not $1.2 trillion as initially reported.']"
06/21/2016,"['Imagine a $50 million diamond heist that isn\'t investigated by any police body, and more than four days later, the broken vault that made the whole thing possible remains unfixed and suffers follow-on attacks by a group of marauding copycats. In essence, that\'s what\'s happening to an elite group of investors holding Bitcoin rival Ethereum, and the events threaten the very survival of the fledgling cryptocurrency.\n\nThe ransacked jeweler in this parable is The DAO, a crowdfunded investment fund that relies on highly specialized computer code and Ethereum to automatically execute investment decisions made by its members. On Friday, thieves exploited a software bug that allowed them to transfer more than 3.6 million ""ether""—the base unit of the Ethereum currency—out of The DAO\'s coffers. The digital loot made up more than a third of The DAO\'s 11.5 million ether endowment. The seized booty is valued at anywhere from $45 million (based on the plummeting value of ether following the attack) to as high as $77 million (based on pre-attack exchange rates).\n\nIn the days following the theft, there have been at least a half-dozen copycat attacks (for instance, as documented here and here) that combined have purloined more than 785 ether. While the smaller attacks don\'t pose the same devastating blow, they underscore a problem that\'s vexingly hard to fix. As long as the flaw remains active, The DAO and the Ethereum currency are at risk of additional attacks that could further sink its viability. (Note: as this story was close to going live, there were indications that at least some of the follow-on attacks were being carried out by whitehat hackers who in essence are attempting to save Ethereum from itself.)\n\nThe bug resides in software functions individual investors use when cashing out of the fund. The attackers on Friday figured out that when a function called splitDAO() was called, it could be invoked again and again before setting an existing user\'s balance to zero. Exploiting the flaw allowed attackers to repeat the process 30 times, effectively allowing an account with 50 shares to balloon to 1,500 shares. The attackers exploited a second bug that let them to repeat the attack over and over. As Martin Koeppelmann, an entrepreneur and developer of an Ethereum-based startup called Consensus Systems, explained here:\n\nThe attacker managed to combine 2 exploits. The first exploit was to call the split DAO function recursively. That means the first regular call would trigger a second (irregular) call of the function and the second call would trigger another call and so on. The following calls are done in a state before the balance of the attacker is set back to 0. This allowed the attacker to split 20 times (have to look up the exact number) per transaction. He could not do more—otherwise the transactions would have gotten too big and eventually would have reached the block limit. This attack would already have been painful. However—what made it really painful is that the attacked managed to replicate this attack from the same two addresses with the same tokens over and over again (roughly 250 times from 2 addresses each). So the attacker found a second exploit that allowed to split without destroying the tokens in the main DAO. They managed to transfer the tokens away before they get sent to address 0x0 and only after this they are sent back) The combination of both attacks multiplied the effect. Attack one on its [own] would have been very capital intensive (you need to bring up 1/20 of the stolen amount upfront)—the attack two would have taken a long time.\n\nExistential threat\n\nThe hacks pose an existential threat not only to The DAO but to the entire Ethereum currency. To avert the crisis, Ethereum officials have proposed rolling back the blockchain in a way that would invalidate the stolen ether. Such a ""soft fork"" of the Ethereum protocol would have to be approved by 51 percent of Ethereum miners in the form of a software update they would install on their servers. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has said he supports such a plan, but in the same statement, he also recognized it would have to be supported by a majority of the miners, meaning it\'s out of his hands.\n\nThe proposal has set off howls of dissent among some Ethereum proponents. They point out that Ethereum was designed to work with its own dedicated programming languages that allow it to work seamlessly with ""smart contracts."" Such software-driven contracts allow for the automatic payment of funds when a set of detailed conditions are met. Fork opponents say the entire appeal of Ethereum is its decentralized nature that by design is supposed to be immune to control by banks, governments, or other powerful groups.\n\n""If you have a mechanism for generic blacklists, you will see \'blacklist subpoenas\' very soon,"" Bitcoin observer Andreas Antonoopolous wrote on Twitter. ""It\'s a power that will be abused.""\n\nSecurity researcher Rob Graham put it this way in a blog post published over the weekend: ""I\'m a crypto-anarchist. The entire point of cryptocurrencies [is] to get around corrupt humans. And that\'s what trying to repair this problem is—corruption."" He went on to compare a rescue of The DAO to the taxpayer bailouts in 2008 of Wall Street financial institutions on the basis that they were considered too big to fail.\n\nKoeppelmann, the Ethereum-based developer, said the attacker had the ability to deplete The DAO\'s entire fund but stopped around the same time Ethereum officials went public with the theft. The attacker appears to have stopped by choice and not because of any technical consideration in the hack.\n\n""We can assume that the hacker stopped for strategic reasons to make a community decision for a fork less likely,"" Koeppelmann wrote. ""However—the attacke[r] voted in other fork proposals as well—for more details have a look here.""\n\nSo far, there\'s no indication of how many miners support the proposal to soft fork the Ethereum protocol. Whichever path they choose, it seems likely that the crypto currency has suffered a critical blow. If the rollback goes through, it will be hard for Ethereum proponents to argue that the currency is as decentralized or inviolable to self-interested meddling as was once claimed. And if the fork doesn\'t happen, it\'s anyone\'s guess how well a currency still in its infancy will fare when one of its biggest hoards was amassed in such an unethical and unseemly way.', 'Barney Jopson in Washington JUNE 21, 2016 12 A powerful club of US regulators has warned that the growing popularity of bitcoin and other digital currencies is posing potential financial stability risks as it revealed they are being put under closer scrutiny. A group that includes the Treasury department, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission used an annual report on the biggest threats to the US financial system to highlight concerns about digital currencies for the first time. Bitcoin has thrived as an alternative to currencies that are managed for governments by central banks, because it functions as a decentralised, or distributed, database for trusted transactions with no governing institutions. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, the group of regulators, said in its annual report on Tuesday: “Like most new technologies, distributed ledger systems also pose certain risks and uncertainties which market participant and financial regulators will need to monitor.” It noted: “Market participants have limited experience working with distributed ledger systems, and it is possible that operational vulnerabilities associated with such systems may not become apparent until they are deployed at scale.” Some bitcoin fans have worried that the cyber-currency could be thwarted by action by governments concerned about it becoming the currency of choice for terrorists and criminals. In bitcoin’s early days, US regulators insisted that processors install anti-money laundering checks, but otherwise indicated they were content to let the experiment continue. The regulators’ report noted that bitcoin advocates say it can improve the efficiency and transparency of currency systems and reduce risks stemming from transactions being channelled through a small number of institutions. FSOC officials said they were laying down a marker about the nascent technology and seeking to be vigilant about trouble that could lie ahead, but also acknowledged there was no certainty of big problems arising. The FSOC, which is also responsible for overseeing banks and insurers deemed as potential systemic threats, noted that bitcoin had experienced “dramatic” increases in trade delays and some transaction failures in recent months. Related article Handled right, blockchain could help banks and their customers Despite the hype, there are several misconceptions about the technology, writes Huw van Steenis These occurred because “the speed with which new bitcoin transactions are submitted has exceeded the speed with which they can be added to the blockchain”, the regulators said, referring to the record book of all bitcoin transactions. Rather than depending on a central middleman to process transactions, bitcoin relies on a combination of encryption, algorithms and crowdsourcing to create a self-maintaining system of record. Although bitcoin-like systems are designed to prevent fraud by a single party, the regulators noted that “some systems may be vulnerable to fraud executed through collusion among a significant fraction of participants in the system”. Noting its members’ own responsibilities, FSOC said “regulators will need to adapt to the changing market structure” if bitcoin-like systems ultimately reduce the importance of traditional centralised intermediaries. “Since the set of market participants which makes use of a distributed ledger system may well span regulatory jurisdictions or national boundaries, a considerable degree of co-ordination among regulators may be required to effectively identify and address risks associated with distributed ledger systems,” it said.

But, by 13:45 UTC, the digital currency had fallen to $649.47, more than 10% below the day’s opening price.\n\nStill, while the outage at a high-profile exchange likely contributed to the day\'s developments, others described a more complex situation in which key price indicators proved vulnerable to changes in perception.\n\nShifting indicators\n\nOne such change came in the form of a change in the outlook for the ""Brexit"", the nickname for the ongoing debate over whether the UK should succeed from the European Union.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by market research firm Survation on 17th and 18th June, 45% of British voters want their nation to stay in the EU, while 42% want it to leave, findings that signified that sentiment seems to have shifted in favor of staying in the EU.\n\nThe drop in the number of respondents favoring a Brexit helped more traditional investments see a ""relief rally,"" Hayes told CoinDesk.\n\nWhile he maintained that bitcoin prices have benefited lately from heightened fears about the “global macroeconomic outlook,” these concerns may have softened somewhat now that the Brexit appears less likely.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, also spoke to the Brexit and its impact on bitcoin.\n\nHe emphasized that the possibility of the UK leaving the EU was “on the table” up until recently, but that, with this event looking increasingly unlikely, bitcoin\'s ability to serve as a safe asset would decline.\n\nZivkovski told CoinDesk:\n\n""The UK will probably remain in the EU, hence strengthening fiat and weakening bitcoin\'s [use] case of escaping capital controls.""\n\nDAO confusion\n\nThe recent compromise of customer funds associated with the distributed autonomous organization The DAO may also be affecting bitcoin prices, according to Chris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest.\n\nWhile The DAO is built on ethereum, an alternative blockchain platform, Burniske said that he has received correspondences from investors who confused issues with the DAO as representing a ""weakness in bitcoin\'s underlying technology"".\n\n""People who are not well versed in Ethereum, bitcoin and blockchain technology can get easily confused and become gun-shy by bad news,"" he said, adding:\n\n""And there is plenty of bad news surrounding The DAO at the moment.”\n\nAt press time, this situation was still evolving, with customers funds being moved in an apparent rescue attempt initiated by developers.\n\nBitfinex trading outage\n\nOnce bitcoin’s price began falling sharply, this helped fuel a “powerful long squeeze"" that drove prices down further, said Zivkovski. As a result, he posited that ""a snowball effect ensued"".\n\nMax Boonen, founder of market maker B2C2 Ltd, also weighed in on bitcoin’s sharp drop, stating that the outage affected traders who held short and long positions.\n\n""The lower the price went after the outage, the larger the margin calls on Bitfinex when they would reopen,” he explained.\n\nStill, after suffering these declines, bitcoin prices are in good shape to recover, Whaleclub data suggested. Whaleclub’s long-short ratio was 1.5:1 at the time of report, pointing to bullishness, and short interest had failed to become significant, Zivkovski said.\n\n""Most traders are opting to ‘buy the dip’ and are reopening long positions at these lower prices, albeit less confidently,"" he said.\n\nSuch an opinion was also echoed by investor Vinny Lingham, who predicted this decline in prices would not persist.\n\nLingham told CoinDesk:\n\n""The market should rebound pretty quickly.""\n\nCharles L.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'For the last month, attackers have used a combination of phishing and typosquatting to carry out a campaign aimed at stealing Bitcoin and blockchain wallet credentials.\n\nMore than 100 phony Bitcoin and blockchain domains have been set up so far, many which mimic legitimate Bitcoin wallets. Most of the sites were registered on May 26 and more continue to pop up daily suggesting the campaign is still in the early goings.\n\nArtsiom Holub, Dhia Majoub, and Jeremiah O’Connor, researchers with OpenDNS’ Security Labs, traced connections between IP addresses, name servers and Whois indicators over the last few weeks in order to determine the scope of the campaign.\n\nCyren, an Israeli cloud-based security firm, spotted the first signs of life from the campaign in early June when it observed the domain blocklchain[.]info spreading through a pay-per-click advertising scam via Google AdWords. If a user was tricked into visiting the site – a replica of the real deal – and actually logged in, they would have handed their Blockchain credentials over to attackers.\n\nA day after Cyren posted its research, OpenDNS went further down the rabbit hole and noticed a phishing attack at blockchain-wallet[.]top. Like the site Cyren found, the one OpenDNS found looks startlingly similar to the actual Blockchain.info site, the popular transaction database for Bitcoin. The site, which even shares the same logo and teal-colored navigation bar, is still active but Google has since branded it as a deceptive site, warning users attackers may be using it to get users to reveal personal information.\n\nOpenDNS detected a similarly obfuscated URL, blolkchain[.]com connected to the same IP a few days later, on June 13, which prompted researchers to look into the IP and similar IPs in that range. They found dozens of suspicious looking sites, including multiple Blockchain spoof sites like blokchain-wallet[.]info and localbitcons[.]com.\n\nBitcoin addresses have to be Base58Check-encoded in order to avoid confusion between similar looking characters like capital “O” and the number zero. As the researchers point out, that’s why the phishing domains they found rely so heavily on typosquatting, or when Internet users input a website address into a web browser, make typographical errors, and get brought elsewhere.\n\n“From these examples, it’s clear the attackers have a solid understanding of protection mechanisms used by Bitcoin addresses and are trying to defeat them,” the researchers wrote Monday.\n\nLooking at the IPs further the researchers discovered they all shared a provider that’s had three different names over the last year and has been previously called out for hosting what OpenDNS refers to as “criminal and toxic content.” Three anonymous offshore hosting companies have utilized the company’s IP space to peddle child pornography, child modeling, fake merchandise, and a smattering of phishing sites, Blockchain and iCloud-related.\n\nOriginally Ecatel, the service used to be based in the Netherlands before it changed its name to QUASINETWORKS and moved offshores to Seychelles in December 2015. It changed its name to Novogara in April of this year.\n\nResearchers cross-referenced hosted domains and Whois registration for the IPs to identify six different emails used to register – and still being used to register – blockchain spoof domains\n\n“Investigating IP space, name servers and Whois indicators sheds light on how frequently criminal actors recycle their infrastructures and resources, and makes evident just how heavily they rely on bulletproof offshore hosting providers to deliver their malware and phishing campaigns,” the researchers said in a blog entry.\n\nOpenDNS said it blocked the malicious IP ranges for its customers and that going forward wallet companies should strengthen their security in order to prevent phishing and typosquatting attacks similar to ones used by the campaign.\n\nThe news comes at a time when interest around the cryptocurrency is burgeoning. Bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed over the past several months, a trend many have tied to an influx of ransomware. When victims are hit by the ransomware attackers usually demand payment in Bitcoin. In situations like this users are often supplied with instructions on how to purchase Bitcoin using a credit card in exchange for a decryption key.\n\nThe cost for keys runs the gamut from low to higher figures. For instance the ransomware RAA, discovered last week, asked users for as much 0.39 BTC ($ 250) while another strain of ransomware, Black Shades, uncovered earlier this month, only asked users to pay up 0.07 Bitcoin, or $30, to unlock their files.', 'Over a year after being voted in as the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, Bruce Fenton is closing his term, with a relatively unknown South African venture capitalist, Llew Claasen, primed to take over.\n\nAs a bitcoin advocacy group and trade organization, the Bitcoin Foundation will see a new executive director in Llew Claasen, a Cape Town-based venture capitalist.\n\nThe South African is a managing partner at Newton Partners, a venture capital firm and investor with a focus on internet and mobile technology. Claasen will commence duties as executive director on July 1, after being elected in by the board of directors at the Bitcoin Foundation on June 14.\n\nWhile details of the new director are scarce, foundation board member and Lyft co-founder recused himself from the vote, having had a business relationship with Classen in the past. Classen’s appointment was voted for unanimously by the remainder of the board.\n\nIn statements, Classen said:\n\nI’m looking forward to leading the Bitcoin Foundation going forward. There is an amazing opportunity for the organization to help the Bitcoin ecosystem. In the coming weeks, I’ll be working closely with the board, membership, transition team and various stakeholders to create the best plan for success possible.\n\nSuccess would bring welcome respite for the advocacy body that has run into significant monetary issues, to the point where its very existence was at stake. In a board meeting in December 2015, outgoing executive director Bruce Fenton revealed that additional funding was required to retain employees at the foundation. As of November 30, 2015 the foundation’s total assets stood at $12, 553.06. In 2014, the foundation had blown through 5800 bitcoins, resulting in $4.6 million loss the same year.\n\nIn a post on Reddit, Fenton underlines his tenure as director as a success, stating that the foundation had “been through some very tough times with its very future in doubt” when he took on the job. He added:\n\nIt was perhaps it’s darkest hour. Today, as I leave, the foundation is a the best it’s been in years, possibly ever.\n\nHe cites certain factors behind the implied change in fortunes since he took over. Chief among them was the call to cut expenses by 94% from peak spending every month. He also pointed to increased transparency with the foundation, along with a new mission statement that sought to foster bitcoin core development.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Bitcoin price has been one of the hottest topics in the entire investment world this month, whether within mainstream circles or within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin started the month trading at under $530 USD, and within two weeks surged to as much as $780 USD, before leveling out at their current levels, about $200 USD ahead of May’s price.\n\nThe heat in the Bitcoin market\n\nAs we head to the halfway point of probably the most important year in the digital currency’s history, BitPay CCO Sonny Singh discussed the main reasons for the heat in the Bitcoin market before the days of summer.\n\nRegardless of one’s previous investment portfolio, anything that grows over 40% in a couple of weeks is going to draw even a mainstream crowd. Bitcoin is entering its halving event in less than three weeks, so now is the time to expect great volatility.\n\nSingh has submitted the following analysis in regards to the global Bitcoin markets as of late. Not surprisingly, it all starts in Bitcoin’s largest mining and exchange market. “China,” says Singh to Bloomberg West.\n\nHe continues:\n\n“There’s been a lot of activity having China’s (Yuan) price run up about a month ago, and the Yuan was starting to be devalued, and capital controls were starting to go into effect. The people were using (Bitcoin) as a way to get some money into a currency that is not being depreciated.”\n\nBrexit, gold, silver and Bitcoin halving\n\nSingh also made sure to note that Bitcoin was up over 35% in 2015. In comparison, the U.S. Dollar rose less than 10% last year.\n\nNext up is the Brexit vote this week. As seen last summer during the “Grexit” fiasco, Singh suggests Bitcoin could be seen as an international investment ‘safe haven’ in this time of national and regional economic uncertainty, on par with precious metals like gold and silver, and the facts back up his claim. Since June 1st, silver is up about 10% and gold is not far behind. Other countries like Brazil and Venezuela, with faltering economies, are also increasing Bitcoin usage year by year, buoying trading value.\n\nThe easy answer is the Bitcoin halving, currently scheduled for July 10th. Singh confirmed with Chinese exchanges that the halving is fuelling speculators in China to move in on Bitcoin this month, hoping the value increases later this year.\n\nOddly, Bloomberg host Cory Johnson called the buying strategy “stupid,” comparing the Bitcoin halving to the value of one large potato chip having more value than two small potato chips.\n\n70% of Bitcoin transactions are international\n\nSingh says that the fourth reason, which he thinks is the most exciting, is that the Bitcoin adoption is growing globally.\n\nHe explains:\n\n“Two years ago, when the price was over $1000 USD, the number of Bitcoin transactions per day were only 50,000 (now, the number has grown to 5X that amount, daily) (and) 70% of our (BitPay) Bitcoin transactions were happening domestically in the United States, and today that has completely reversed! Now, 70% happen internationally and 30% domestically.”\n\nTo further that point, since the close of Mt. Gox, major companies like Microsoft, Expedia and the gaming platform Steam, recently added by BitPay, have adopted Bitcoin, increasing its global appeal.\n\nBitcoin works well in major markets, like India, which may not have credit cards made for online gaming, so Bitcoin can be a preferred international payment avenue.\n\nThe coming weeks in Bitcoin may be very volatile and CoinTelegraph will keep you up to date on the market changes, so bookmark us for the latest Bitcoin price news.\n\nImages provided by Goldprice.org\n\n- by Evander Smart', 'Singapore-based bitcoin exchange Quoine has raised $20 million from venture capitalists, building on a $2 million angel investment in December of 2014, according to dealstreetasia.com. The exchange will move its headquarters to Tokyo, while keeping its Singapore office.\n\nQuoine is one of several bitcoin exchanges serving Japan to secure investments this year. Zaif raised $6.5 million in May while bitFlyer secured $27 million in April.\n\nCorporate Bitcoin Investment Rises\n\nExpanding investment by corporations in bitcoin marks a continuation of a 2015 trend.\n\nData from CB Insights cited by dealstreetasia indicated that the top five largest bitcoin and blockchain investments have totaled $131 million in 2016 to date, of which only $4 million did not come from corporations. In 2015, corporations invested a total $298 million. Funding in 2014 was $161.5 million, of which none was from corporate sources, while 2013 witnessed $54 million, none from corporate sources.\n\nQuoine launched in 2015, tapping the Japanese potential for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Japan, the world’s third largest economy and the Indo-Asia-Pacific region’s second largest economy, has regulated bitcoin exchanges in order to both regulate and legitimize cryptocurrency trading.\n\nJapan: Third Biggest Economy\n\nMario Gomez Lozada, current president and CEO of Quoine, told The Japan Times that Quoine saw Japan as the third biggest economy that no one was tapping from a bitcoin perspective.\n\nLozada believes the company will attract Japanese consumers based on his knowledge from working with traditional banking systems. Much of the company’s core management team has worked with UBS, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and SoftBank.\n\nMike Kayamori, co-founder and CEO of Quoine, said he envisions banks using the public ledger’s smart contracts to automate. He said the Euro was an excellent thesis, but its implementation was wrong. He said each country cannot control its own money flow. The global currency is bitcoin, which is driven by supply and demand, like fiat currencies.\n\nBitcoin And Blockchain Potential\n\nMartin Tillier, a finance journalist and former FX trader, noted in a recent Nasdaq opinion piece that bitcoin is still in a disruptive period in a positive way. The growth in projects using blockchain-like systems is delivering reasoned coverage about bitcoin, causing more people to understand what bitcoin is and how it can be a positive force.\n\nKamori noted that loyalty point cards, online currency trading and mobile game tokens were all popular speculative investments in Japan. When coupled with a cultural aversion to investing in stock markets and deflation, retail investors in Japan tend to invest in forex markets.\n\nHe said Japan will be larger than China from a liquidity and volume perspective. Japan’s retail FX outsizes all other countries, he said.\n\nAlso read: Digital Currency industry in Japan awaits regulation\n\nQuione Positions For B2B Market\n\nQuoine is adopting a business-to-business (B2B) trajectory to position itself as an “exchange for exchanges” that offers liquidity to established brokerages that will be able to leverage cryptocurrency trading possibilities for further revenue growth.\n\nKurt Hanson, an angel investor in Quoine, said the $20 million represents a vote of confidence in Quoine. He said he is looking forward to seeing the company build its Asian business and take bitcoin mainstream. He said Quoine will continue its “amazing growth” for the next five years, particularly in the remittance market of Asia’s developing countries.\n\nAfter working on what it calls Banking 3.0, Quoine will become a virtual bank to everyone, like the Airbnb and Uber of banks, Hanson said. Bitcoin will grow at a steady pace. Convincing the average consumer it will benefit them will be the challenge.\n\nQuoine, as part of its 3.0 strategy, will spin off some of its technologies like the loan platform and work with exiting fintech companies to provide services via mobile app by tapping into APIs, Hanson said. The goal is to offer a full banking solution that ranges from interest earning accounts, basic deposits and fund transfers (via blockchain wallet technologies) to more advanced features like investments, loans, wealth management and trading.\n\nQuoine announced in March that it was launching Ethereum trading. The company noted users can trade ETH versus any of 10 supported fiat currencies. It noted it would make ETH/BTC available. Quoine is not licensed to operate in the U.S.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Blockchain is already a huge phenomenon. But it has issues. Can blockchain fulfill its promise? Can it have a big impact on financial services, healthcare and perhaps other industries? You betcha! Here\'s how.\n\nBlockchain is big\n\nFirst it was BitCoin. Now it\'s blockchain, which is what people call the ""underlying technology"" of BitCoin. Although that\'s about as accurate as calling the combustion engine the underlying technology of the car, only leaving out the gas tank -- it won\'t work!\n\nIn any case, expectations among investors are riding high. Here\'s a snapshot of investor interest:\n\nObstacles to blockchain\'s success\n\nProbably the biggest problem with blockchain is that it\'s just a kind of database with a peculiar set of characteristics. Just having a database doesn\'t make everyone involved in a problem suddenly decide to digitize everything in the same format, make the same calls to the same API\'s and respond to everything appropriately. So the problem is often one which blockchain simply doesn\'t solve.\n\nThere\'s also a deep obstacle. It\'s one that is obvious to any technical person and makes common sense, but for reasons that elude me, is rarely discussed among blockchain investors and enthusiasts. The problem is the community validation protocol that assures the integrity of the ledger. As part of BitCoin, the problem is cleverly solved by miners, who are incented to provide this service by being paid in BitCoin. When you take BitCoin out of ""blockchain"" and apply blockchain to other applications, you take away the payment mechanism for miners to do their job. This fact alone has a long string of ramifications, among which is the integrity and security of the ""distributed ledger.""\n\nHistory of other advanced technologies\n\nThe obstacles to success for blockchain are serious. I wonder what we could learn from looking at history? Perhaps there are other abstruse, advanced technologies that also overcame serious obstacles and became smashing successes. Maybe we could learn from them and see how blockchain could similarly enjoy the great success that is so widely predicted for it.\n\nThere are several historical parallels that could be applied to block chain. One that seems relevant is neural networks.\n\nHNC Software was started in 1986 to exploit the incredible power of neural networks. ""Neural,"" like what\'s in your brain, get it? It\'s like smart computers! The bright boys of HNC got contracts and were solving all sorts of important problems in multiple fields. Sort of. Around 1990, the CTO of a credit card company, Household International, brought them in to solve his company\'s fraud problem. After a while, with the data and help of Household, they got something good going.\n\nHousehold let them get data from other card companies to make their models even better, and soon HNC was rocketing. They went public, became the card industry\'s standard solution, and eventually merged with FICO.\n\nI was active in the card industry when they were rapidly growing, and I knew a couple of the people whose names were on the patents. Everyone accepted that HNC\'s solution trumped everyone else\'s because, after all, it was based on that amazing new technology ... neural networks!\n\nLooking under the covers\n\nIf you took off just the top sheet, you would see that HNC had devised carefully controlled training protocols to overcome the over-training that frequently hobbles neural networks. Clever!\n\nBut seeing what was really going on was an eye-opener. Underneath all the neural net stuff was a large and growing body of ... get ready ... human-created rules! Little snippets of code, each of which would identify a certain pattern of fraud. As new fraud was discovered, humans at HNC (mostly) would add a new rule to the set of (when I last saw it) thousands of rules. The latest set of card transactions, both legit and fraud, would then be run through the training system, and the neural network would be trained to balance the output of all the rules and combine them into a single probability score.\n\nNet-net: the rules did the fraud recognition, the neural networks weighted the rule outputs into a combined final score for a given transaction.\n\nThe message of HNC and the understanding of the market was clear, however: the HNC solution was better than anything else, it was based on near-magical neural networks, and life is good.\n\nApplying the lesson\n\nHNC provides an excellent model for how blockchain can succeed in the market. They\'ll do it the same way neural networks did. Investment and attention will go to important problems; the problems will get solved by stubborn, hard-working people who are motivated to get something that works, and don\'t really care about the extent to which what people call blockchains are involved. The marketing people will promote the magical elixir of blockchain, everyone will ohhh and ahhh, and no one will care what\'s under the covers, so long as it works.\n\nIt worked for neural networks and HNC, and genuinely frustrated the fraudsters. The same pattern can work for blockchain.', 'BITCOIN\n\nBlockchain’s fan base has just gotten bigger.\n\nTwo more countries are set to adopt the technology that supports the popular digital currency bitcoin into their own banking systems, albeit with different goals.\n\nThe Bank of Canada announced last week that it is testing how the blockchain technology can be used for interbank payments. But the Canadian central bank stressed that “it has no plans” to come up with a digitized version of the Canadian dollar.\n\nBlockchain, as we all know, makes use of cryptography to create a distributed ledger system to hold and spend money in a more open, transparent and flexible manner compared to the traditional bank or credit card companies.\n\nSo far, the Bank of Canada has taken up a proof of concept experiment with New York-based start-up R3 CEV, Payments Canada, and several Canadian commercial banks.\n\nBank of Canada Senior Deputy Gov. Carolyn Wilkins hinted that this could be the first of many experiments involving digital currency technologies, telling The Wall Street Journal: “Other frameworks need to be investigated, and there are many hurdles that need to be cleared before such a system would ever be ready for prime time.”\n\nSweden is also testing the blockchain technology, but for a different purpose: land registry.\n\nThe Scandinavian country is working with several blockchain-related firms—blockchain company ChromaWay, consulting firm Kairos Future, and telecommunications service provider Telia—to place Sweden’s land registry on blockchain, Reuters reported.\n\nThe experiment, which is in the proof of concept stage, involves putting real estate transactions on the ledger system, where anyone from banks, the government, brokers, sellers and even buyers can keep track of the progress of the deal.\n\nMagnus Kempe, director of retail and finance at Kairos Future, told Reuters the project is already on the second phase of testing—one that involves “a full sized environment.”\n\nThe project will put Sweden on the blockchain map as the first country to have a distributed ledger-based land registry.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price and transaction volume\n\nThe price of blockchain’s digital currency dipped slightly on Tuesday—mainly due to Bitfinex exchange’s unscheduled downtime—when it registered at a low $698.52, with 15.68 million bitcoins in circulation.\n\nComments']"

As more disenfranchised laborers disappear into the underground gig economy, exchanging their skills for money, bitcoin offers them a convenient end-around for the traditional income reporting demanded of employees and independent contractors.\n\nIndividuals who sell illegal drugs online or engage in other illicit activities, such as completing math homework or writing term papers for other students, now regularly request payment in bitcoin and filter their communications through encrypted e-mail networks such as Tutanota.\n\n""It\'s a very easy way to optimize your wealth,"" explained a computer programmer who supplements his day job by doing computer science projects for college students. ""They tell me what they need, I deliver the service, and no paper trail is created. I use Blockchain for payments and, really, I\'m at a point where I could quit and do this full-time.""\n\nIn addition to turning thousands of middle-income people into professional tax evaders, bitcoin could theoretically allow wealthy speculators to complete complicated commercial transactions, such as tax-exempt stock and gold-swapping trades that involve buying agents acting as ""straw men"" by using local currencies to facilitate the exchange.\n\nSo far, there are no particularly effective enforcement mechanisms that would allow state and federal revenue services to track the online movement of bitcoins. This creates a tremendous opportunity for tax evasion: cryptocurrency advocate Trace Mayer estimated that if even 1% of funds currently sitting in offshore accounts were transferred to bitcoin, the value of this virtual currency could increase substantially. Since the number of Bitcoins in circulation is currently capped at 21 million, if these billions of offshore dollars migrate to that cryptocurrency, the worth of a single bitcoin could rise from $580 to nearly $3 million.\n\n\n\n""Although some people might think that stockpiling bitcoins is a shrewd strategy, behaviors such as underreporting income, not reporting income, and living well beyond one\'s means can trigger a tax audit, and huge investments in bitcoin wouldn\'t be easy for corporations to make without facing government scrutiny,"" tax attorney Aaron Richter told Motherboard. ""Furthermore, the actual IRS treatment of bitcoin is not especially favorable if you are reporting it as income and paying income tax withholding and payroll taxes, which you must do if you receive bitcoin in exchange for work.""\n\nI never signed or accepted the Constitution, but bitcoin is real.\n\n\n\nBitcoin, often treated as a cash substitute in under-the-table sales, is regarded by the Internal Revenue Service as a capital asset, meaning it is subject to the same rules that govern stock and barter transactions when it is finally exchanged for dollars. This is a raw deal for someone being paid in bitcoin who is actually reporting the payment, since they could be taxed on $500 of income only to have the bitcoin they received depreciate significantly in value before they can redeem it.\n\nFor bitcoin users who prefer to trade on the black market, the position of the IRS regarding the currency is irrelevant. ""As a steroid dealer and user, and somebody who was influenced very much by [objectivists] Ayn Rand and Mike Mentzer, I think of bitcoin as the solution to the problem of illegal tender, our so-called \'paper money\' economy,"" said a personal trainer who accepts the cryptocurrency as payment for his pharmaceutical services.\n\nWhen informed that the 16th Amendment allows the federal government to tax all income from whatever source derived, the trainer shrugged.\n\n""I don\'t believe in that because it\'s fictional. I never signed or accepted the Constitution, but bitcoin is real. It\'s real money and it can\'t be stolen from me.""', 'This April 3, 2013 file photo shows bitcoin tokens in Sandy, Utah. (Photo: Rick Bowmer, AP)\n\nIt\'s not only Chinese retail investors who\'ve gone bullish on new digital payment systems and currencies such as bitcoin.\n\nLarge firms there are also making sizable investments in the blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin, which hit a two-year high Monday on demand in China, then plunged 10% Tuesday.\n\nA consortium of technology and financial firms in China has made a $60 million investment in the Chinese unit of Circle, a U.S.-based blockchain-payments startup.\n\nThe firms include Baidu (BIDU), the Chinese search giant; CICC Alpha, a growth-investing unit of the China International Capital Corp.; the private-equity arm of China EverBright Investment Management Ltd.; CreditEase, an online lender owned by Yirendai (YRD), a Chinese financial services firm traded in the U.S., and IDG Capital Partners which led the round, according to a draft copy of an upcoming blog post from Circle that I\'ve seen.\n\nCircle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who also founded video-advertising startup BrightCove (BCOV), which went public in the U.S. last year, and had a previous software company acquired for $360 million, confirmed the investment in a phone interview.\n\nThe Circle funding round was led by IDG Capital Partners, one of the first U.S. venture capital firms to invest in China, and also included existing Circle investors Breyer Capital and General Catalyst Partners.\n\nThe funding round, Allaire says, like the huge bitcoin trading volumes in China that have come amid stock-market volatility there, shows how the world\'s most populous country is well ahead of the U.S. in adopting digital payment systems.\n\n""If you look at the trends, China very well could be the driver of the adoption of block chain consumer services,"" says Allaire, whose self-named company was acquired by Macromedia in 2001.\n\nDigital payment services, such as Alipay (a former unit of Alibaba that\'s still used on the giant\'s e-commerce sites) and a rival used on the WeChat messaging service owned by Tencent, already have hundreds of millions of users.\n\n""That\'s why we\'re not trying to compete with them,"" Allaire told me.\n\nWhile those services process payments made within popular messaging services in China\'s currency, known as the yuan or renminbi (Rmb), Circle runs what is essentially a global Internet exchange bank based on the blockchain, the digital ledger that records bitcoin transactions.\n\nCircle, which operates in the U.S., U.K. and Europe, and hopes to open soon in China, processes those transactions within and between traditional currencies, including the British pound and the U.S. dollar, and digital currencies, including bitcoin rivals such as Ether and Ripple.\n\n""We use the block chain to share value just like Internet protocol lets us share communication,"" he says. ""Our goal is to build a global, international bank that is instant, global and free. Sending payments should be as easy as sending an email,"" Allaire says.\n\nIn December, the investment bank Goldman Sachs, which is an investor in Circle, told its clients in a report that the blockchain ""could disrupt everything.""\n\nThis week, the price of bitcoin soared above $700 amid heavy volumes in China. While many have pointed to the action as evidence that Chinese consumers are taking money out of the country, Allaire says there is another driver.\n\nChina investors are getting more sophisticated and diversifying their asset base, says Allaire, who owns bitcoins in his own investment portfolio and who sold his first company just before the dotcom bubble burst.\n\nThis column is not written as an endorsement to buy bitcoin, which is volatile and may or may not survive as a currency. Bitcoin has a finite number of currency units, or coins, that must be \'mined\' by solving difficult computer problems requiring expensive resources.\n\nThe run-up in the price also comes before a planned change in the technology which will make mining bitcoin less profitable.\n\nBut it\'s worth noting that a growing number of major global investors are betting that the technology behind bitcoin will have enduring value, and that China is at the forefront of investing in and using bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nJohn Shinal has covered tech and financial markets for more than 15 years at Bloomberg, BusinessWeek,The San Francisco Chronicle, Dow Jones MarketWatch, Wall Street Journal Digital Network and others.

Too much knowledge was demanded of the developers whose ideas were behind the explosion of ethereum-based app development.\n\nWhile ethereum’s digital currency-powered blockchain, combined with a Turing-complete programming language, promised to let developers easily construct distributed applications (dapps), according to Todd, the skill to actually deliver on that promise might be higher than expected.\n\nThough it takes more work using bitcoin’s scripting language to accomplish the same tasks as with ethereum’s Solidity, it\'s also easier to see the problems, Todd argued. The very nature of the bitcoin scripting language means that each of its different states can be analyzed in isolation. With Solidity on the other hand, the problem is essentially a moving target.\n\nTodd likened it to making a sandwich. With ethereum, the sandwich would require instructions on where to place the knife on the bread before applying mustard, and how many times to spread the condiment.\n\nWhereas with bitcoin, developers order the ingredients themselves.\n\n""You say, I want this on my sandwich, go make that happen,"" said Todd. ""And you will get predictable results because you’re at the right level of abstraction.""\n\nChristopher Allen, principal architect at bitcoin development startup Blockstream, put the sandwich metaphor differently:\n\n""[Ethereum] is like if you were given a pig and some wheat.""\n\nBuild me a plane\n\nPrior to joining Blockstream earlier this year, Allen co-authored the TLS security standards that help protect a wide range of communications via our modern computer networks.\n\nAllen said the perception that ethereum was easy to build with naturally led to an expectation that complicated, large-scale projects like The DAO should be built. When in reality, he argues, the problems could be broken down into simpler components and resolved in more traditional ways.\n\nOne example Allen mentioned that those whose projects are now in limbo in The DAO might want to consider is using existing contract law and the open-source principles to found and test a network of traditional limited liability corporations. Then, after the LLCs are established, run experiments with how to encode certain parts of the work-flow using ethereum\'s blockchain or bitcoin’s blockchain.\n\nAnother way forward for those DAO projects trapped in limbo is to break down the concepts coded into their software into more the fundamental elements of a transaction, for which he says bitcoin is better suited.\n\nBy using this method, and solving small groups of problems at a time, he contends DAO developers could discover new ways to use existing bitcoin technology and other tools currently being developed to express the idea as a series of transactions.\n\nAllen compares today’s dapp construction to the early days of the airplane development when successful models were built using wood and paper.\n\nAllen said:\n\n""We need to have more test pilots and we need to have more experimental planes and things of that nature. This is dangerous for a while.""\n\nBitcoin is a net\n\nIn the history of digital currency, The DAO will likely go down as the Mt Gox of ethereum. One key difference, however, is that this time around the digital currency industry has a stronger sense of itself.\n\nUnlike Mt Gox, which had a relatively small support team and was overseen autocratically by its then-CEO, The DAO is being triaged by the Internet of Things startup, Slock.it, which wrote its original open-source code; members of the Ethereum Foundation that helps oversee the ethereum codebase; and a drove of independent coders connecting online.\n\nBut another key difference is that when Mt Gox collapsed, the bitcoin community had nothing to fall back on but its own ingenuity.\n\nWhile Peter Todd argues that computer science isn’t yet ready to successfully pull-off what The DAO claimed to offer — a leaderless organization run on a bundle of smart contracts and designed to support an ecosystem of related startups — he says that ongoing work by Bitcoin Core developers and the surrounding ecosystem are advancing efforts to build similar distributed autonomous services without the bugs.\n\nYesterday, he published a lengthy update on his work to build a state-machine approach to ""smart contract"" systems, called Proofchains or Dex. In interview Todd also mentioned the work of Johnson Lau’s Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree, which he said ""begins to allow us to do much more complex constructions"".\n\nAllen’s Blockstream already has Elements Project, an open-source community for deploying sidechains used to test early versions of bitcoin’s proposed Segregated Witness upgrade. Segregated Witness is in its own right another example of efforts underway by the bitcoin community to increase the complexity it can host, while not sacrificing safety.\n\nFar from being a stranger to controversy, Todd himself is one of the central figures behind the debate over how best bitcoin can scale.\n\nIn interview he said he felt bad for the Ethereum developers who are currently trying to solve the problems that led to the current crisis.\n\nBut in the same way he and other bitcoin developers learned from Mt Gox, he said he’s trying to learn from The DAO:\n\n""We really have to be careful to not allow the kinds of things that happened with The DAO. Or even worse, things that might risk the entire bitcoin ecosystem. Could it be said that we are too conservative? Quite possibly.""\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The last century of financial regulation within the world’s largest economy, in the United States, has bred a literal treasure chest of regulatory bodies that look more like an alphabet soup than any cohesive form of governance.\n\nIt is difficult to tell if one made-up group of regulators are just created to boost national employment numbers, protect the proletariat, or to check another set of fact-checkers who guard a larger, established thiefdom.\n\nSpeaking of thiefdoms, private companies like The Federal Reserve, in association with federal organizations like the SEC and the Treasury Department have crafted a new annual report under a group name called the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC. This report focuses on the safety and overall health of the U.S. economic system and has done so for the past five years.\n\nNegative fodder\n\nThis year, Bitcoin and its blockchain technology are featured under the inclusive section labeled “Potential Emerging Threats and Vulnerabilities.” To sample the report in its 161-page entirely, click here. In this small ebook of impending economic doom-and-gloom, this is what the cabal had to say about the new technology known in the report as “distributed ledgers,"" or blockchains:\n\n“…..Although distributed ledger systems are designed to prevent reporting errors or fraud by a single party, some systems may be vulnerable to fraud executed through collusion among a significant fraction of participants in the system.”\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin and what it brings to the table, the FSOC regulators found negative fodder to focus on, referring to the extended blockchain transaction confirmation times.\n\n“For example, in recent months, Bitcoin trade confirmation delays have increased dramatically and some trade failures have occurred as the speed with which new Bitcoin transactions are submitted has exceeded the speed with which they can be added to the blockchain.”\n\nBitcoin is at Gandhi\'s stage 3\n\nWhile it is clear that Bitcoin is no perfect financial panic at the present time, after just seven years serving the world, I would need a few thousand paragraphs to go over the economic errors and strife U.S. regulators and organizations have committed in the same timespan, after a couple of centuries of practice. This report is itself a sample form of a mea culpa of economic issues facing the U.S. both now and in the future.\n\nTime for a rhetorical question. Does anyone remember the time when Bitcoin was beneath the scope of the mainstream media, much less U.S. national economic threat reports?\n\nThis annual report certainly did not mention Bitcoin, or its blockchain technology, 3-4 years ago. Yet, in 2016, they must be included, in their own section, no less.\n\nThis is no glowing review of Bitcoin and its underlying technology, like the one the Bank of England produced last fall. It seems designed to be more of a more common operational scare tactic for government officials. Alas, you know what they say, “There is no such thing as bad publicity.”\n\nThe steady progress Bitcoin continues to make into the greater mainstream of macroeconomics reminds me of the famous quote by Mahatma Gandhi. It goes: “First, they ignore you. Then, they laugh at you. Then, they fight you. Then, you win!” Bitcoin seems to be deep into Stage 3 of this natural progression towards its ultimate acceptance.', 'Image: stock photo\n\nCraig Wright, the Australian man who claims to have created Bitcoin, is quietly attempting to build himself an empire by filing virtual currency patents with UK officials.\n\nIn the last week alone, Wright has used Antigua-based EITC Holdings to file 24 cryptocurrency-related patents with the UK\'s Intellectual Property Office.\n\nSince February, a total of 51 patents has been filed with the office.\n\nPatents filed in the UK, pending review, include those describing the technology behind ""Implementing logic gate functionality using a blockchain,"" an ""operating system for blockchain IOT devices,"" ""payment and distribution of digital content"" and ""a method and system for controlling the performance of a contract using a distributed hash table and a peer to peer distributed ledger [blockchain].""\n\nIf Wright succeeds in his plans to dominate virtual currency-related patents, holding this intellectual property could earn him a fortune as the technology underpinning the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market would likely rely on licensing to the patent holder.\n\nAccording to Reuters, sources close to EITC say the company is far from finished when it comes to filing patents for the Australian.\n\nEITC expects to file approximately 400 on behalf of Wright.\n\nIf some, or all, of these patents are accepted, the patent portfolio could be sold off for a high price, and would be significant and valuable investments for startups and businesses looking to cash in on digital currency.\n\nPatents concerning the blockchain, in particular, would fetch a high price as the database underpins cryptocurrency as the decentralized recorder and backbone of digital transactions.\n\nAndrew O\'Hagan, a journalist who has spent time with Wright, says that associates of the Australian are working on more patents to file, and the full set will eventually be packaged and sold for ""for upwards of a billion dollars.""\n\nMany doubt the claims of Wright, who says that his alias, ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" was used to keep his true identity as the creator of virtual currency under wraps. Wright provided \'proof\' in the form of Bitcoins known to be owned by the creator of the virtual currency, but experts found that validation was difficult.\n\nA number of figures in the cryptocurrency scene are asking for additional proof before accepting Wright as the creator of Bitcoin.\n\nSince coming out to the media, Wright has kept a low profile and has mostly declined interviews with the media.', ""Bulletproof hosting facilitates Bitcoin phishing\n\nResearchers have discovered a large-scale phishing scheme that aims to steal Bitcoins and obtain blockchain wallet details.\n\nAccording to a blog post by Artsiom Holub, Dhia Mahjoub and Jeremiah O'Connor at OpenDNS, the focus on Bitcoin is down to it being easier to steal than normal cash.\n\nThe new phishing campaign was spotted by security researchers from Cyren at the beginning June, when a phishing campaign using the domain blocklchain[.]info as its web address began to spread using Google AdWords.\n\nThe OpenDNS team spotted that websites hosted on certain IP addresses had a history of abuse and were behind other scams and malicious websites in the past, such as fake banking and iCloud websites and more.\n\n“Given this shady content, we blocked the entire IP Range for our customers and as a reference, we provide the list of domains on the 89.248.171.0/24 range,” said the researchers.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that the IP address belonged to a firm registered in the Seychelles called Novogara. It was previously known as QUASINETWORKS. Prior to that, it was named Ecatel and was based in the Netherlands until December 2015.\n\nNovogara is known as a “bulletproof hosting provider”, which gives protection to customers regardless of whether or not they are involved in criminal activities. As Ecatel, it was subject in 2012 to DDoS attacks by Anonymous for hosting child porn.\n\nCross-referencing hosted domains and Whois registrations identified six different emails used to register blockchain spoof domains.\n\n“Investigating IP space, name servers and Whois indicators sheds light on how frequently criminal actors recycle their infrastructures and resources, and makes evident just how heavily they rely on bulletproof offshore hosting providers to deliver their malware and phishing campaigns,” said the researchers.\n\nThey added that as cryptocurrency technologies gain momentum, so too will a new set of security problems, so it's imperative these online wallet companies deploy proper security methods to protect against this new wave of targeted phishing and typosquatting attacks.\n\n“Rogue and bulletproof hosting providers continue to provide a safe haven for these malware and phishing campaigns. Our objective at OpenDNS is to track and predictively block malicious content via DNS traffic analysis and proactive monitoring of various indicators such as IP space, Whois, and SSL certs,” they said.\n\nJamie Moles, principal security consultant at Lastline, told SCMagazineUK.com that the most likely people to fall for this are individuals who while technical enough to be involved in the use of bitcoins (it's still a fairly niche game) are not cyber-security savvy.\n\n“There has been an uptake in bitcoin usage by victims of ransomware over the past 12 months and many of these individuals are barely technical enough to get bitcoin up and running in order to pay a ransom and save their data – potentially just the kind of person who could fall for a well-crafted phishing email and unlikely to be protected by any significant APT detection solution,” he said.\n\nIn a side note, Bitcoin's price broke the US$775 (£530) barrier on Friday, trading briefly at a $778.70 high not seen since early February, 2014."", 'PayPal is slowly dipping its toes in the bitcoin waters.\n\nThe company has partnered with Coinbase, a virtual currency wallet and exchange, so Coinbase users can sell bitcoin and cash out to their PayPal accounts. Buying bitcoin isn’t possible yet, but the small integration is a noteworthy first step.\n\nPayPal did not immediately respond to Quartz’s request for comment.\n\nWhile bitcoin and its underlying technology, blockchain, has caught Wall Street’s attention, consumer tech giants have largely stayed away from the technology until now. Recently, Quartz reported that Airbnb “acquihired” a bitcoin company and its engineers. Other tech giants, like IBM and Microsoft, have been exploring blockchain tech more closely. IBM developed open source code that’s being used in the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger consortium. Microsoft has been integrating blockchain services into its Azure cloud platform.\n\nBehind the scenes, PayPal’s been showing signs of interest in virtual currencies. A recently published patent application from PayPal shows the company has explored integrating bitcoin and other virtual currencies like LiteCoin and Dogecoin into physical smartphone payments. The patent application was filed in December 2015.\n\nPayPal also held a hackathon in December, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the event. The purpose? To find out new ways for PayPal to use bitcoin and blockchain technology. The attendees included Snapcard, a B2B bitcoin payments company, Coinbase, and Chain. Developers tested things like cross border payments, merchant processing, and creating a digital wallet using bitcoin.\n\nFor bitcoin’s growth, even a slight interest in bitcoin on PayPal’s part would be a big win. PayPal has over 180 million customers and processed $1.4 billion in payments in the first quarter of 2016.

Adoption in Mexico has increased quite a bit over the past year and is showing signs of steady growth within the Mexican borders.\n\nNow Mexican freelancers can receive their pay using Bitso tethered to the Bitwage platform. The Bitwage firm was co-founded by John Lindsay and Jonathan Chester and the company states it enables “workers receive their wages in flexible distributions including digital and local currencies.” Bitwage aims to reduce cost in regards to payroll, transfer speed and make the payroll process trackable and immutable. The company states that the partnership with Bitso allows payroll processing more efficient for businesses internationally. Bitso’s blog announcement explains the integration:\n\n“If you live in Mexico and receive your list of companies from the US and Europe, this service is for you. This integration allows your customer to make a payment for your services via bank transfer in your country while you receive payment in Mexican pesos to your account. The integration takes advantage of the efficiency and security offered by Bitcoins to transport your payroll around the world within minutes. Bitwage has tools to track your payment through its platform, making safe and transparent process.”\n\nBitso has received $1.8 million in venture capital investment on May 16, 2016, from investors such as the Digital Currency Group, FundersClub, and Hard Yaka. With the new integration Bitso says the Bitwage tools will help users track payments through its platform allowing lower commission, and faster payment processing because of Bitcoin’s superior protocol. Mexican remittance is in the billions every single month and processes quite a bit of pesos and international currencies. Both companies for a limited time only are also giving $5 bucks to anyone who signs up for an initial Bitwage account and becomes a registered user on the platform.\n\nMexico’s Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) has acknowledged the use of Bitcoin within the region’s borders. Additionally, the central Bank of Mexico has issued a warning concerning the use of cryptocurrencies. However growth in the country has grown quite a bit with exchanges such as Volabit, MexBT, and Bitso has also acquired a small Mexican exchange called Unisend Mexico. According to CoinATMradar.com, there are three Bitcoin ATM’s within the area and the Mexcian Bitcoin community has large groups on social media platforms like Facebook as well.

That plan got a big boost with Wednesday’s announcement of a $60 million windfall from mostly Chinese investors and the formation of a Beijing-based venture that will work to bring Circle’s mobile payments service to the world’s most populous country.\n\nFounded in 2013, Boston-based Circle uses blockchain—the distributed ledger technology that powers the digital currency bitcoin—to enable users to send and receive payments instantly, without fees, via mobile messages that can be personalized with pictures, emojis, GIFs, and so on.\n\nThe company got its start as a bitcoin payments service, but has since expanded to traditional currencies. Circle stopped marketing itself as a bitcoin service in recent months, after it raised a $50 million venture round last year and added the capability to send money in U.S. dollars. Bitcoin isn’t mentioned on Circle’s home page, nor was the word used even once in the company’s blog post announcing the $60 million raise yesterday.\n\nCurrently, Circle users can transfer money in the form of U.S. dollars, U.K. pound sterling, and bitcoin, including the ability to convert between any of those currencies. Circle said Wednesday it will add euros in the next month with the launch of its service in Spain, part of a broader push into Europe. And its independent China venture, established six months ago, is working on securing regulatory approvals to offer its service there and add China’s renminbi to the company’s currency options.\n\n“We founded Circle on the vision that we should all be able to exchange value the same way we share content, information, and messages on the Internet,” Circle founders Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville wrote in a blog post Wednesday. “Money should work the way that the Internet works—instant, global, free, open, and fun. Executing on that vision involves connecting the world’s major currency zones.”\n\nChina represents a significant opportunity for Circle, given that mobile payments are already hugely popular there. “Messaging and payments, [peer-to-peer] lending, and novel forms of saving and investment, powered by the Internet and software, are accelerating at an incredible pace in China, outpacing the West,” Neville and Allaire wrote in the blog post.\n\nBut gaining a foothold in China could be difficult. If Circle gets the green light to operate there, it will be up against more established China-based competitors like Tencent’s WeChat and Alibaba’s Alipay, which respectively boast 760 million users and 450 million users worldwide, according to Bloomberg. “We don’t have any belief that we can come in and dethrone those products, but there’s an opportunity for Chinese consumers that want to share value globally with friends in other parts of the world,” Allaire, Circle’s CEO, said in the Bloomberg report.\n\nCircle’s China-based investors might be able to boost its efforts there. The new venture round was led by prior Circle backer IDG Capital Partners, the Beijing-based venture firm. China-based Baidu, CICC Alpha, China Everbright Limited, Wanxiang, and CreditEase also invested. U.S. backers in this round include Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners, former IBM chief executive Sam Palmisano, and Silver Lake co-founder Glenn Hutchins.\n\nCircle has raised $136 million from investors to date. The company said it expects to process more than $1 billion in transactions this year.\n\nJeff Engel is a senior editor at Xconomy.

Bitcoin price and charts may change every day, but it is a good time to look beneath the numbers for true Bitcoin value.\n\nOn Tuesday, Coinbase announced that they have a deal with PayPal where American users of PayPal will be able to sell Bitcoin and receive the funds directly into their PayPal account. According to the Coinbase corporate blog, this is just the beginning of what will be a global agreement that will affect all of the almost 200 million PayPal customers, worldwide.\n\n“Thousands of Coinbase users use PayPal for their fiat currency transactions around the world. Through this integration, Coinbase users are now able to sell BTC and have their USD funds deposited to a PayPal wallet. To start, we’re offering PayPal cash-out for US users only. In the future, we hope to add support for other countries, and to support buys through PayPal as well.”\n\nThe mass adoption of Bitcoin will depend largely upon the payment and service infrastructure that underpins each transaction. The easier and more convenient it is to buy and sell Bitcoin, the more people will do so. Integrating a leading service like PayPal is an important step in Coinbase’s goal of making Bitcoin transactions easily accessible, either through online payment or any debit card, which PayPal’s service can facilitate.\n\nBuying Bitcoin directly\n\nCoinbase also used this occasion to announce the ability to use credit cards to buy Bitcoin directly. Both systems are currently in beta, but are available by visiting the payment methods page on Coinbase.com or tap ""Settings"" and then ""Payment Methods"" on iOS or Android.\n\nPayPal has been one of the more supportive and intrepid companies when it comes to seeing a future that includes Bitcoin in their business plan. PayPal, last November, held a hackathon called “Battlehack” to find new ways for PayPal to use and integrate bitcoin and blockchain technology. This event included Coinbase, as well as Snapcard and Chain. Concepts like cross-border payments, merchant processing, and creating a digital wallet using bitcoin were all brought to bear at the time.\n\nIn addition, PayPal’s Venmo allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin already, and as we have reported on recently, PayPal has been working on a new “modular device,” with patent filings, specifically designed for the use and storage of decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin', 'Fearing a possible EU collapse, and attempting to diversify away from a volatile dollar, billionaire George Soros has begun heavily investing in gold stocks.\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal article, Soros Fund Management, the $30 billion fund which oversees Soros’s investments, made a series of large investments into precious metals. Soros bought a $264 million stake, or 1.7% in Canada-based Berrick Gold, while cutting investments in US-based stocks by one third.\n\nHedging against potential EU collapse triggered by “Brexit”\n\nSoros is aligning his investments with precious metals in reaction to the potential collapse of the EU if “Brexit” is successful and the United Kingdom leaves the Union, according to the billionaire.\n\nSoros told the Wall Street Journal:\n\n“If Britain leaves, it could unleash a general exodus, and the disintegration of the European Union will become practically unavoidable. I’m confident that as we get closer to the Brexit vote, the ‘remain’ camp is getting stronger. Markets are not always right, but in this case I agree with them.”\n\nBritish citizens, seeking economic security when faced with a potentially successful exit vote, flocked to gold during June, causing Royal Mint sales to soar by 32%. As expectations for the impending vote shifted to remaining in the EU, the price of gold slipped to a two-week low on Thursday.\n\nBitcoin joins gold as a “hedge” in turbulent times\n\nDuring turbulent times of low confidence in governments, financial systems, and the global or local economy, investors turn to precious metals for financial stability.\n\nRecently, however, Bitcoin has joined gold as a popular “hedge” against unstable times. Brexit has illustrated this trend.\n\nA new chart from Bloomberg tracks the price of both gold and Bitcoin against polling for the UK to remain in or leave the EU. The chart shows the price of both closely tracking polling for Brexit, peaking as estimated probability of leaving the EU was at its highest in mid-June, and falling as that probability waned later in the month.', 'Bitcoin prices have cratered recently as a series of recent events, including a trading halt at one major exchange, has left some investors rattled.\n\nThe price of a single coin shed more than $100 dollars in the span of five hours late Wednesday, falling from $669 to a low of $554 shortly before midnight Eastern Time, according to data from CryptoCompare.\n\nProblems began Monday when Bitfinex, the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange based on trading volume, began experiencing issues with its platform, leading it to suspend trading. After briefly bringing trading back on line, the exchange was forced to halt trading a second time on Tuesday, citing similar issues.\n\nIn a tweet published Monday, the company emphasized that the outage was due to an infrastructure issue, and that it had not affected security at the exchange, or customers’ funds.\n\nTrading has been paused while we investigate an infrastructure issue. The issue does not involve funds or system security. — Bitfinex (@bitfinex) June 20, 2016\n\nStill, the glitches for some recalled memories of Mt. Gox, said Charles Hayter, the founder of CryptoCompare. Mt. Gox, formerly one of the world’s largest exchanges, initially blamed technical issues when it abruptly halted bitcoin withdrawals in February 2014.\n\nThe exchange was eventually forced to declare bankruptcy after it admitted that hackers had stolen millions of dollars’ worth of customers’ bitcoins.\n\n“Those wounds are still raw,” said Hayter.\n\nLast week, a similar selloff occurred in bitcoin rival Ethereum after a theft of more than $50 million in its ether tokens from an organization, referred to as the DAO. Ether tokens boast the second-largest market capitalization among the world’s cryptocurrencies behind bitcoin.\n\n“The events over the DAO hack might have spooked some people from ether to Bitcoin helping with the rise in price and now that ether is recovering a little that movement is reversing the action,” said Tone Vays, the head of research at Brave New Coin.\n\nWhile the Bitfinex outage was the initial catalyst for the selloff, other factors—like the looming Brexit vote in the U. K.—were affecting the price, Hayter said.\n\nRecent polls showing support tilting toward a vote to remain in the European Union in Thursday’s referendum helped to diminish bitcoin’s appeal, Hayter said. Trading in the cryptocurrency has been closely correlated to gold US:GCQ6 in recent weeks, a sign that bitcoin is behaving like a haven asset.\n\nRead: Digital currency Ethereum nose-dives after $50 million hack\n\nRead: This bitcoin challenger is up 1,100% this year—but is it ready for prime time?\n\nRead: Chinese buyers push bitcoin price to highest level since Mt. Gox blowup\n\nBitcoin’s recent run-up also might have left prices overextended and primed for a selloff, some said.\n\nThe value of a single coin peaked above $780 on June 18—its strongest level since Feb. 3, 2014—before the selloff began.\n\n“The price rise was too fast. It just needed a break,” Vays said.', 'A senior official for the central bank of The Netherlands has presented the results of two cryptocurrency tests designed to explore how bitcoin’s blockchain might be adopted by national banking institutions.\n\nThe experiments by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) sought to simulate bitcoin both in its early days and in the year 2140, when the final bitcoins are expected to be mined. The bank presented the results at the third-annual Dutch Blockchain Conference, held just outside Amsterdam earlier this month.\n\nThe tests, conducted in 2015 but not reported until earlier this year, utilized an experimental digital currency called DNBcoin.\n\nIn a speech given at the event on 20th June, the head of the central bank\'s market infrastructures policy department, Ron Berndsen, explained that researchers within the institution wanted to get a hands-on experience working with the technology.\n\nBerndsen told attendees:\n\n""The general idea was that by adapting the Bitcoin software ourselves we could learn deeper how an actual implementation of the blockchain really works than if we would only perform desk research and go to conferences such as these, no matter how interesting.""\n\nBitcoin in the beginning\n\nTo create the simulation environment, the DNB put together a working group of in-house experts who would act as fictional participants in a digital currency system.\n\nTo do so, the bank ""bootstrapped"" a team of “intrinsically motivated” members of the bank, said Berndsen. The group then adapted the open-source bitcoin software to replicate what its members believed the bitcoin ecosystem might have looked like in the first two months of the digital currency\'s existence.\n\nUsing five networked laptops, the DNB team mined their first DNBcoin block – known as the genesis block – and quickly generated “thousands” of more blocks. Along they way, they sent coins to one another, testing the ins and outs of the process like setting transaction fees.\n\nThe bank’s network created new blocks, along with freshly minted DNBcoins, about every three minutes, compared to the roughly 10 minutes expected in the bitcoin network, said Berndsen.\n\nIn the year 2140\n\nThough the end of bitcoin\'s lifecycle is more than a century from now, the DNB wanted to simulate what those conditions might look like as well.\n\n“The second DNBcoin prototype takes the other extreme of bitcoin by jumping to the year 2140, the year when the last fraction of the 21 million bitcoins will be issued,"" Berndsen said in his speech.\n\nFor this experiment, the central bank team needed to mine all of the DNBcoins in advance. To do so, they were created using a single laptop before opening the network to other computers.\n\nTo cut back on the amount of power needed to mine the DNBcoins, the team began with an initial block reward of 1 billion DNBcoins, then programmed the system to quickly lower the number of coins rewarded per block.\n\nBerndsen explained:\n\n""In doing so we were able to generate 3 billion DNBcoins in 30 seconds. In addition, we observed that after all DNBcoins had been generated, blocks could still be mined and added to the blockchain. The reward was reduced to zero but transaction fees were still collected by the miner who finds the next block.""\n\nWhile the first two prototypes were built with the specific aim of learning more about how central banks might use virtual currency, a third experiment is currently being developed to explore other aspects of blockchain.\n\nSpecifically, Berndsen listed digital assets, trust, network resilience and the ""intelligence to initiate or trigger transactions"" as areas that will “probably” be tested in the third experiment.\n\nObstacles to central bank adoption\n\nBerndsen said that central banks are “increasingly” interested in blockchain because of the distributed ledger technology’s potential to improve financial market infrastructure.\n\nBut specific to the DNB, Berndsen named blockchain\'s potential to impact all three of its ""primary tasks"": to promote the smooth functioning of the payment system, provide supervision and oversight and inform monetary policy.\n\nBefore central banks can adopt blockchain, Berndsen named interoperability, industry fragmentation and self-interest among financial incumbents as three barriers that need to be overcome.\n\nBerndsen concluded:\n\n""History teaches us that when looking ahead into the distant future, it is wiser to predict that something is possible, rather than that something is impossible. The blockchain technology offers a number of advantages over existing technologies. But there are also some drawbacks and barriers to overcome.""\n\nImage of De Nederlandsche Bank via Wikimedia\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But coursing through the article is a deeply troubling prospect: what if one of the most influential technologies since the worldwide web has now slipped into private hands?\n\nThe LRB piece describes a business deal pursued by Craig Wright, an Australian academic, with an IT expert and an investor. Wright was almost broke, claims the LRB, and his backers held out the prospect of clearing his financial woes and freeing him for a life of funded research.\n\nPart of the deal was that Wright would publicly confirm his alter ego as Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of the virtual currency Bitcoin. This went spectacularly wrong when Wright was unable to provide the proof sought by the Bitcoin community.\n\nIf you think the story ends there, in a tragic case of mistaken identity, think again. Also part of Wright’s deal was the transfer of his intellectual property. And as Reuters reports today, businesses allegedly connected with Wright are still pursuing patent claims around the technology that created Bitcoin.\n\nAnd that’s the bit you have to focus on: it doesn’t matter who really invented Bitcoin. What matters is who can claim the patents. Even if Wright wasn’t the creator of Bitcoin but rather part of the development team, or even an early adopter, if he or others can claim “prior art” then they may be able to patent rights over some of the core tech behind the most disruptive financial product of the century.\n\nTo understand why this is a big deal, you need to understand that Bitcoin is in fact two things: on one level, it’s a currency like any other, subject to the same fluctuations as its bought and sold. But standing behind the currency is a revolutionary principle called triple entry accounting.\n\nPut simply, when a Bitcoin is passed from one person to another, its transfer is recorded in the electronic wallets of the giver and receiver. But its journey is also recorded in a public ledger. Each new transfer has to be mathematically reconciled with every previous transfer, making fraud very difficult.\n\nIt’s not just money that can be tracked and audited through this “blockchain” system; anything with value can be traced: shoes bought, cars scrapped, hours worked, taxes paid.\n\nIf you want a vision of life in a blockchain world, take a look at this interview with Craig Wright. About two minutes in he uses the example of a can of soft drink. Its purchase can be tracked in the blockchain, and attributed to a buyer.\n\nIf that buyer throws the can in the recycling bin, then when the can is recycled the blockchain can reward them (perhaps via a small council tax discount). If the buyer chucks the can in the river? Expect a bigger tax bill when the littering is revealed.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this concept is attracting huge interest and multimillion-dollar investment from serious financial institutions. And if Wright (or any of his connected companies or associates) can patent it they’re in line for a big slice.\n\nIf you want an insight into how valuable (and therefore legally tortuous) patent disputes can be, take a look at how a row between Google and Oracle over a few thousand lines of code turned into a $9bn lawsuit.\n\nThe risk is that similar patent disputes may hamper innovation in blockchain development. Some very bright minds are putting blockchain tech on the same level as the worldwide web.\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee’s decision to make web tech public property has kickstarted what many feel is a new era of human development.\n\nBlockchain, similarly, was founded on a free-for-all basis. It’s deeply troubling if Craig Wright’s financial woes have led it into private hands.', 'Colu, the coloured coins protocol innovator, is focusing on the ways and means of issuing central bank cryptocurrency, having raised some $9.6m (£6.6m) in funding for the project.\n\nThe Series A round, backed by Aleph, Spark Capital, Digital Currency Group and former Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer, follows a $2.5m seed round back in 2015.\n\nColu\'s efforts have been buoyed by the recent Barbados central bank cryptocurrency experiment in which it took part with Bitcoin startup, Bitt.\n\nColu CEO Amos Meiri told IBTimesUK: ""What people want is a local currency. We realised there is a real need for a new form of currency. We started working with different cities around the world together with a new strategic investor. But we can\'t disclose his name – a leader in the world of currencies.""\n\nThere has been quite a lot of interest in the idea of central banks issuing some kind of cryptocurrency, and some bold moves in this area are being driven by the likes of eBay\'s Pierre Omidyar and his philanthropic investment vehicle the Omidyar Network.\n\nColu has seen many use cases being built on top of its platform, which denotes assets with watermarked bitcoin, including stocks, real estate and music.\n\nMeiri said that the central bank currency use case involves real scale and a solution which requires more than just the Bitcoin blockchain. ""We started with coloured coins; assets on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. While it\'s great for certain things, it\'s not great for assets that need millions of transactions. A digital version of cash is something that you need to transfer a lot every day, so we cannot work only with the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThis could involve some combination of Bitcoin and a private network. It could be also be some kind of super-fast, scalable payment channel, a relation of the proposed Lightning Network.\n\nHe said: ""We are working with something that will basically connect the public blockchain, which for me is only Bitcoin, and private network that a central bank or a city would be able to run.\n\n""We have developed something that I cannot say a lot about yet. We are going to have something published about it later on this year. But we connect basically between a private permissioned chain with the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMeiri said this could impart the sort of security and immutability associated with Bitcoin, while having more freedom to add privacy and AML, KYC to the ledger that the country is going to run.\n\n""If you start a network which is permissioned and the central bank knows all the players, but you use the transparency and the immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain, then we get into a very interesting point where you are gaining from both worlds.\n\n""You have the private chain which is secure because it\'s a network, and let\'s say every now and then all the transactions are being hashed on Bitcoin blockchain.""\n\nLots of people are talking about Lightning, which could be the great white hope of Bitcoin for the future. State channels can also help address privacy because only a portion of transactions are broadcast to the network. Meiri made it clear there are a number of different ways to approach this. He said Colu has been looking at some Lightning code and is also joining the Hyperledger Project pretty soon.\n\nHe said: ""We actually took a lot of open source that exists and we found an interesting way to connect and have something that\'s actually working. The biggest problem in this field is that there\'s a lot of talk about different things but when you start to look at the code, a lot of it doesn\'t work yet.\n\n""But there is so many smart people you don\'t need to invent everything. Building the whole stack from the lower level to the application level is very difficult and we decided to focus more on the application level.\n\n""So, for example, we offer the wallet which is where you store your currencies, and of course you can send them easily for free. You can explore the merchants around you that accepting this as local currency.\n\n""Basically a wallet is a platform, and we have also developed a merchant service where a merchant can easily accept the currency and also exchange it back to the local currency itself.\n\n""There is a control panel where you are managing the economies. So this is the kind of a dashboard for either a municipality or the government or whoever wants to manage the economy.\n\n""Here you have lots of values like collecting real-time data of the economy; every economy that is going to use it, immediately they become stronger because they don\'t need to wait a quarter to understand GDP or other financial data. Everything is in real time and it\'s very easy to issue, distribute and manage everything,"" he said.', 'For Bitcoin, the Brexit poll couldn’t have come at a more uneasy time but some good developments are taking place on the sideline.\n\nThe digital currency has been in and out of an almost three-week low on Thursday June 23 at around the $580 range which is quite worrying especially for those who still cringe in anticipation of a smooth ride as they step into its world.\n\nToday, Thursday June 23 the United Kingdom is deciding whether to leave the European Union or not. The impending outcome is shaky as latest tracker shows it could still go either way. So is the stable point of Bitcoin price. Shaky and dicey to go either higher or lower on one point, and to stay put on the other.\n\nThis is on the backdrop of financial markets that have been roiled for weeks as opinion polls pointed to a lead for the Leave campaign though the UK stock market and sterling rallied in recent days on fresh polling suggesting British voters would opt to Remain.\n\nGiving an outlook, Admiral Markets’ Analyst, Nenad Kerkez, presents a research which shows a winning Bremain option with the 53% (R) of votes vs 47% (L) for Brexit. This compares to four other polls conducted by YouGov 42%R/44%L, Financial Times (44%R/44%L), ORB 53%R/46%L and Survation 45%R/42%L.\n\nA Bremain, for him, will restrict the upside while a Brexit will create possible longs in Bitcoin. “If we see a Brexit, Bitcoin should jump heavily,” he said adding that it seems to increase its value during risk off as a defensive asset.\n\nAdvisor to Wings, Dominik Zynis, shares a similar view. \u200b”Massive BTC pump,” he says on what to expect in the case of a Brexit though with a caution. “No, but really, Brexit would take some years. It’s not a kill switch just a recommendation to parliament and Her Majesty.”\n\nKerkez, who is also a full time trader, thinks a Bremain would look for buy opportunities in dips in GBP/USD while Germany, a key partner for the United Kingdom, would have to brace up for the impact of Brexit on German Stock Index DAX.\n\nOn Wednesday June 22, US stocks dipped in low trading volume. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.9 points, or 0.27 percent, to 17,780.83, the S&P 500 lost 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,085.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.44 points, or 0.22 percent, to 4,833.32. The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX closed at 21.17, its highest in four months, indicating traders are more willing to pay for protection against a decline in the S&P 500.\n\nThough a dip in the market is nothing unusual, the situation in question has some good developments on the sideline.\n\nCircle China and other developments\n\nOn the same Wednesday, Circle payment app announced two related milestones: a $60M strategic financing from a syndicate of major Chinese strategic investors; and the formation of Circle China, a new Beijing-based company focused on bringing the benefit of open, global, blockchain-powered social payments to Chinese consumers.\n\nThat follows a Bitso and Bitwage partnership to roll out Bitcoin payroll services in Mexico to enhance remittance particularly from the US, and the Winklevoss Twins have been promoting their newly-launched Gemini U.K. bitcoin exchange and its similarity in trading between Bitcoin and gold.\n\nPayPal has also partnered with Coinbase to enable its users to sell Bitcoin and cash out to their PayPal accounts.\n\nWhile there have been suggestions that it could take between two to four weeks for the impact - if there is any - of the auctioned Bitcoin in Australia to be felt on the market (based on the actual amount paid), it is worth noting that the fluctuating Bitcoin price could be a positive for shrewd traders of the currency. However, while they could be profiting from it, such may not augur well for the long-term growth and adoption of the currency.', ""CA, June 23, 2016 at 08:26 UTC\n\nLeader in Blockchain Big Data and Analytics Now Accepts Bitcoin as a Medium of Investment\n\nBlockchain Intelligence Group (“BIG”) today announces that the Company now allows potential investors the opportunity to buy shares in the current BIG private placement using Bitcoins, a digital currency, besides traditional monetary forms.

06/24/2016,"[""Britain's decision to exit the EU has predictably shocked global currency markets. The pound has dropped around 10 percent against the dollar, a 30-year low as the market reacts to uncertainty over the UK's vote. While traditional currency markets react to the news, cryptocurrency bitcoin has started to surge in price. Bitcoin dropped to a weekly low of $550 yesterday, but it has passed the $650 mark today.\n\nThat's still far off the two-year high of $719 from earlier this month, but the volatile currency appears to be spiking thanks to Brexit. The price of bitcoin has been fluctuating wildly recently, due to a number of factors. Earlier this week, Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex was knocked offline for a few hours due to networking problems. Opinion polls over Britain's position in the EU also saw Bitcoin price fluctuations, and the uncertainty around Britain's referendum affected China's yuan as it hit a five-year low last week. A large amount of bitcoin trading occurs in China, so any yuan changes will have an effect on the price of bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin price over the past 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin's climb alongside a Brexit vote has led some to declare it as a safe haven for investors. Predictably, the price of gold has spiked this morning as investors buy up traditional safety assets. Bitcoin is clearly rising alongside gold, but it's still far too early to declare it a new safe haven for investors. Quartz points out that all the bitcoin in circulation is worth around $10.6 billion, a small amount compared to the trillions of dollars that pass through foreign exchange markets every day."", ""By Nadine Hoffmann, Global Head of Payments, SAP SE and Raimund Gross, Innovation Manager & Futurist, SAP\n\nWhen bitcoin was released in 2009, it fundamentally changed the way that people think about money and financial transactions. And while bitcoin never became as universal as it hoped to be, the system behind bitcoin is now poised to disrupt the way financial organizations operate. That system is the blockchain. Some have gone so far as to say blockchain will do for business transactions what the internet did for information. Those early adapters might just be right.\n\nThe blockchain is, at its core, a ledger of all information pertaining to a digital transaction. For financial organizations, the ability to harness that information poses a tremendous opportunity. It allows for faster processing time, lower costs, greater insight into market moves, increased transparency and compliance. But that’s just the start of it.\n\nBlockchain is listed as one of the driving forces behind the sharing economy, according to a World Economic Forum study. And a report co-authored by Santander earlier this month estimated that blockchain technology could reduce banks' infrastructure costs by up to $20 billion a year. Investors and the venture capital (VC) community are pushing hard to realize those cost savings. At the end of 2015, investments and funding of blockchain-related start-ups had grown from $298 million in 2014 to almost $460 million.\n\nThis influx of capital has allowed for increased experimentation and partnerships between traditional banks and the VC and start-up communities. This is especially true in the payments space where banks, as well as companies like eBay, PayPal, etc., are using blockchain to build a secure verification process for users.\n\nSince late 2015, these experimentations and partnerships have begun to generate results and momentum for blockchain. In January 2016, R3CEV, a blockchain start-up working with more than 45 banks to advance adoption of the technology, announced that 11 banks, including Barclays, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Royal Bank of Scotland, TD Bank, UBS, UniCredit and Wells Fargo, among others, had successfully completed a blockchain connectivity experiment. This news followed the announcement from NASDAQ that the Nasdaq Linq blockchain ledger technology had successfully completed and recorded a private securities transaction.\n\nBlockchain’s Potential and its Obstacles\n\nSpeed and accuracy are the currencies of the digital economy, and blockchain’s ability to quickly validate trusted partners and facilitate accurate recordkeeping and trade is very relevant to banks and financial institutions. But with a banking engagement, it’s not often a 1:1 flow of information. Instead, it could be shared access for multiple parties (with the right security clearance) or a one-to-many flow of information.\n\nLet’s consider supply chain processes around letters of credit, as an example. These currently rely on different parties — buyer, seller, bank, insurer, logistics provider, etc. — accessing the same information. Traditionally, it’s taken days, if not weeks, for that information to be passed through each organization. With blockchain technology, that information can be shared instantaneously. It does this by creating a shared repository where all data is accessible in real time to those with the right security clearance or access codes.\n\nAs evidenced above, banks and financial institutions are already heavily investing in blockchain. In fact, many have been doing so for years. But it’s still mostly done in a silo – undertaking very specific tasks, like: crypto currencies, managing the clearing and settling process, payments, or R&D initiatives. The true test for blockchain will be in how it integrates with existing technologies and infrastructure to scale from small, test cases to larger, enterprise wide operations. And this is where it will, undoubtedly, get interesting. Leaders in the field will now need to work on establishing procedures that connect blockchain’s rich data to an organization, allowing businesses to quickly analyze information to make informed choices about business operations or strategy.\n\nThere will no doubt be challenges along the way to mass integration - blockchain was not initially designed to take on the complexities and challenges of the enterprise. It was meant to serve an individual consumer – the bitcoin user. For it to be a successful, widely used tool for banking institutions, there must be a greater emphasis put on architecture and data integration as well as security and regulatory policy.\n\nLike other new innovations in FinTech, blockchain will have to figure out how to cope with and adapt to regulations that vary in degree and complexity. In April of this year, The Chamber of Digital Commerce and three leading blockchain trade organizations launched the Global Blockchain Forum, whose mission is to help form blockchain regulations. Expect to see those regulations put in place sooner rather than later, especially as the technology continues to advance. Certain countries and states may have an easier time reaping the benefits of blockchain, as regulations and experience with blockchain vary depending on the location.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold?\n\nFor businesses considering the blockchain today, it’s important to keep these questions in mind:\n\nWhat are the operational implications?\n\nHow can blockchain propel our business model forward?\n\nWill it increase efficiencies or allow us to scale more effectively?\n\nIn the next two to three years, many of these questions will be answered. There will be an increase in business use case examples, in banking and other industries, which demonstrate ways of overcoming blockchain’s obstacles and the benefits it can bring to a business. As these use cases begin to overwhelm the current, technical discussions, we will have a better understanding as to the long term business relevance and viability of the technology.\n\nWhile bitcoin may have been a flash in the pan technology, it has given the financial world a new way to look at its architecture and systems with blockchain. As this space evolves throughout the few years and more banks integrate blockchain into their overarching operations, one thing is certain – the possibilities are endless.\n\nThis story originally appeared on SAP Business Trends."", 'It is going to be a wild summer for the price of Bitcoin. The only certainty in the space will be change.\n\nWatching the roller coaster is fine for the speculators out there, but maybe new protocol reinforcements will help spur prices higher, and stabilize the environment. The much-hyped Segregated Witness application is about to be brought into play, if it hasn’t already, by the Bitcoin Core developers.\n\nConfirming the unconfirmed\n\nNews of the advancement forward of Segregated Witness, or SegWit, made waves on Reddit’s r/Bitcoin Thursday afternoon in the form of a single forum discussion screen capture posted on Imgur. This pic seems to indicate a discussion by the Core developers about now being the time to put SegWit into action, after spending an appropriate amount of time within the testnet.\n\nIt would be far too easy to just take this at face value and say SegWit is now operational on Bitcoin’s blockchain, but another forum source on botbot.me has another conversation that says the opposite.\n\nNote the times above in the screen capture. In the botbot.me forum, just a few minutes later, it seems a similar conversation is going on, dated yesterday, with the same usernames.\n\nUnder the heading “#bitcoin-core-dev,” CodeShark says “just to be 100% clear, the plan is no more minor releases on 0.12, merge segwit into master now but without activation parameters. Correct?” gmaxwell simply responds “CodeShark: No.”\n\nSo we can gather that SegWit may or may not be actively used beyond the testnet at this time, but until a formal announcement by Bitcoin Core can be reviewed, it is safer to assume that it is very, very close to deployment, if not currently active.\n\nThis seems to answer the speculation of if SegWit will beat the Bitcoin halving event to market as the discussion is more in line with a proper release within a day or two. The actual announcement may come from a large mining pool, or other informed third’ party rather than from the Core developers.\n\nBenefits of SegWit\n\nNow would be a good time to review the benefits of adding SegWit to the protocol. Primary among them is the ability to make the current blockchain block size much more efficient, in real-world practical applications.\n\nSince old nodes will only download the witness-stripped block, they only enforce the 1 MB block size limit rule on that data.\n\nNew nodes, which understand the full block with witness data, are therefore free to replace this limit with a new one, allowing for larger block sizes.\n\nSegregated Witness, therefore, takes advantage of this opportunity to raise the block size limit to nearly 4 MB, and adds a new cost limit to ensure blocks remain balanced in their resource use (this effectively results in an effective limit closer to 2 MB).\n\nTransaction times will shorten\n\nHopefully, this will help get transaction times closer to the optimal ten minutes than the current times of 30-60 minutes, at least in my personal experience.\n\nOther benefits include , but may not be limited to malleability fixes, an easier implementation of the upcoming Lightning Network, simplification of the addition of “smart contracts” to Bitcoin’s protocol, more linear scaling of sighash operations, the ability to start signing input values, increased security for multi-sig via pay-to-script-hash (P2SH), can add script versioning functionality, reduction of UTXO growth and Compact fraud proofs.', 'Bitcoin wallet and exchange Coinbase has revealed new funding methods – PayPal and credit cards, to further enable digital currency transactions and swaps in its exchange. The support for the two new funding mechanisms is currently in beta.\n\nIn a move that can be seen as a further sign that PayPal is dipping its toes into the bitcoin space, a tie-up with digital currency exchange Coinbase will see the latter enable PayPal support for bitcoin selling.\n\n“Through this integration, Coinbase users are now able to sell BTC and have their USD funds deposited to a PayPal wallet,” Coinbase explained in a blog announcement.\n\nAs things stand, the San Francisco-based bitcoin company will enable the feature for US users alone before expanding support to other countries. Furthermore, Coinbase also intends to enable bitcoin purchases via PayPal.\n\nPayPal has notably shown interest toward bitcoin and digital currencies. The most recent indicator was the revelation of a patent filed for a payment device that accepts cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, LiteCoin and Dogecoin. The patent was filed in December 2015. A fortnight later, PayPal announced a new member to its board of directors, bitcoin evangelist and entrepreneur Wences Casares.\n\nCoinbase is also adding support for credit cards, a move that enables purchasing bitcoin and digital currencies using a credit card. Adding credit card support comes soon after the exchange enabled bitcoin buying with debit cards for all US customers, a feature that was announced toward the end of April 2016 following a beta launch in March.\n\nThe rollout of the two new features isn’t widely available for all Coinbase users just yet, with both services currently in beta.\n\n“We’ll invite more users to each service over the next few weeks, and we’ll be expanding to more countries in the coming months,” Coinbase added.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Singapore-based Quoine, the startup offering a bitcoin exchange and other cryptocurrency-related services, announced today that it has secured a total of $16 million in a series B round.Following a series A round when the company raised $2 million from several angel investors back in December of 2014, this round was led by Japanese investment company Jafco with participation from an unnamed VC firm and several unnamed businesses. Since this round is not closed yet, the company said that it may additionally raise up to $4 million from potential business partners.\n\nAccording to cryptocurrency portal Coinhills’ real-time ranking of global bitcoin exchanges in volume of transactions, Quoine is ranked in 7th place following Chinese six exchanges in a craze of speculation. This list obviously indicates Quoine being Japan’s largest bitcoin exchange followed by BtcBox and bitFlyer as well as one of the world’s leading bitcoin exchanges. Given that the annual amount of foreign-exchange (FX) trading in Japan has reached about $50 trillion, Kayamori predicts about 10% of these transactions being replaced by cryptocurrencies in the future. Quoine transacts bitcoins worth of $50 million a day, but he thinks it will be able to expand up to 100 times that of today.\n\nThe latest funding was obviously swayed by the perspective that the demand for bitcoin will grow exponentially upon Japanese parliament’s recent enactment of a bill for regulating cryptocurrency exchanges. While Mario Gomez Lozada, who had formerly served as CEO since the launch of Quoine, later became CTO to focus on system development, the company named co-founder Kariya Kayamori as the new CEO earlier this year. Prior to launching Quoine, Kayamori had been involved in developing businesses at leading Japanese companies like Softbank and Mitsubishi Corporation. In addition, the company has changed its structure between their Singaporean and Japanese business entities, where the Japanese company has now become the parent of its subsidiary in Singapore while the Singaporean entity used to be the parent to the Japanese one.\n\nBut here the question of how and why did Quoine become ranked high in the transaction amount despite the fact that the company is not so famous among bitcoin exchanges in Japan may come to mind. The answer is their B2B2C (business-to-business-to-commerce)-focused business model, where Quoine is offering backend engines for several other acting and upcoming bitcoin exchanges.\n\nIn Japan, many Internet service providers and online portal sites are offering online brokerage services for stock and FX trading. However, due to cost efficiency as well as the need to secure the robustness and stability a typical financial platforms requires, many of them adopted systems from other online securities companies and such. Similar circumstances will be likely to happen in the bitcoin exchange industry as well, so Quoine wants to win these needs. Citing Kayamori’s words,\n\nIt’s an exchange of cryptocurrency exchanges, let’s say, we want to be somewhat like the cryptocurrency version of Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\nQuoine established a bitcoin exchange in Indonesia in October of 2014 in partnership with that country’s largest payments processor Indomog, while also expanding into other Asian markets. Their future focus is on Japan and Asia as well. The company claims that they want to be Asia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by partnering with local cryptocurrency exchanges and other service providers holding many of the potential cryptocurrency users in the region.\n\nEdited by “Tex” Pomeroy.

06/25/2016,"['Thursday\'s historic vote by Britain to exit the European Union (EU), known as the Brexit, carried with nearly 52 percent of Britain\'s support, and nearly every one of the world’s financial markets have reacted to the threat of Britain leaving the EU with turmoil.\n\nMost markets plunged, especially stocks and currency in Europe where a loss in confidence in the EU or Britain are both hardest felt, but some markets did just the opposite. These were mainly the so-called safe-haven assets, which includes Gold, Silver, the Swiss Franc, and now Bitcoin.\n\nDuring Thursday’s historic event, more than 17.4 million Britons voted to leave the EU while 16.1 million voted to remain in the nationwide June 23 referendum. In England and Wales, more than half voted to leave the EU whereas in Northern Ireland 55.8% voted to remain and 62.0% in Scotland. British Prime Minister David Cameron, firmly opposed to leaving the EU, subsequently announced his resignation stating that he would be out of office by October.\n\nThe Brexit vote was promised by Prime Minister Cameron in 2013 in order to appease the growing anti-EU wing of his own Conservative Party. Technically, the referendum isn’t legally binding by itself, not until the British government invokes Article 50, a provision of the EU treaty. It is unlikely that Mr. Cameron would go against the will of the voting majority, however, he has said that he would leave the invocation of Article 50 to his successor at any rate.\n\nWhile it will take some time for Britain to begin its exit procedure, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker reportedly said in an interview with Germany\'s ARD television station that he wants the process to begin now.\n\n- Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission\n\nThe most obvious market reaction was the British pound plummeting to its lowest level since 1985. Investors fled to the American dollar and the yen, at least on their way out to other safe-haven assets.\n\nMuch of the rest of the Eurozone markets were hit by large selloffs too. The Euro Stoxx index, which measures stocks in the Eurozone, closed down 7.7% for the day on Friday. The Euro itself fell 1.7% against the USD, and 4% against the Yen while rising 4.7% against the British pound.\n\nInvestors did the most damage to the Eurozone’s more debt-riddled, peripheral economies, including Italy and Spain. However, the U.S. stock market saw its’ share of the carnage as well, despite not being aligned with either side of the Brexit vote officially. Wall Street suffered their worst drop in ten months during Friday’s trading, following major overnight losses in Hong Kong and Japan.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.4%, or 611 points, closing at 17,400. The S&P 500 fell a similar 3.6%. Nasdaq’s composite index, already underwater for the year, fell a whole 4.1%. Overall, the Brexit market panic eradicated nearly $800 billion of market value in the U.S. alone, as the Wilshire 5000 index points out.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said that the Brexit vote will usher in a period that\'s even worse than the darkest days of October 1987. “This is the worst period, I recall since I\'ve been in public service,"" Greenspan said on ""SquawkontheStreet.""\n\n- Alan Greenspan\n\nMeanwhile, safe-haven assets are doing much better. The Swiss Franc climbed to its highest level against the Euro since August last year and Friday marked its biggest single-day jump since the Swiss National Bank removed its Franc peg to the Euro that January.\n\nGold is having its biggest rally since 2008, and its’ biggest one-day gain since September 2013.\n\nMany in the mainstream media are starting to catch on to the similar behavior between bitcoin and gold, especially at times of financial turmoil. Fortune Magazine wrote that “As Global Currencies Plunge Over Brexit, Investors Turn to Bitcoin,” and Bloomberg went so far as to chart out how closely gold and bitcoin are acting while they claim “Bitcoin Trades Like Gold as Investors Seek Brexit.”\n\n\n\nVenture Capitalist Barry Silbert took to twitter to note that the occasion was special because bitcoin seems to be in the process of being introduced to the world as an official safe-haven.\n\nTwitter has been alive with commentary and predictions by bitcoin executives, speakers, and developers on the matter. Another Venture Capitalist, Vancouverite Marc van der Chijs, stated plainly what he saw happening to bitcoin:\n\nMeanwhile, famed bitcoin speaker and author Andreas Antonopoulos tweeted approval of the transformation:\n\nAll over social media and the blogosphere was like a full-day celebration for bitcoiners once the results from Britain were in. British bitcoin exchange Magnr was among the first to tweet in celebration, even before the results were finalized:\n\nJesse Powell, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based Kraken, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange in Euro volume told Bloomberg that ""A lot of people are buying Bitcoin for pounds and Euros.”\n\n- Jesse Powell, Kraken CEO\n\nIn an email statement to Bloomberg, the Winklevoss twins’, whose bitcoin exchange Gemini just expanded into the UK on Tuesday, said that they have “seen a lot of signups from U.K. residents since then. We’ve been open for trading nonstop throughout the week, and are excited to help contribute to digital asset liquidity on a global scale.”\n\nAs much as it seems to have helped the price of bitcoin, not everything about the Brexit news is great for bitcoin users. A few bitcoin exchanges and other bitcoin-related businesses in both the UK and Europe will have some challenges to face. As Britain exits, the existing credit and debit card deals that bitcoin-accepting businesses have in place with credit card companies like Visa may have to be renegotiated. Legal problems may flourish as well.\n\n- Preston J. Byrne, ERIS\n\nSome merchants may even find they have to switch providers to keep accepting bitcoin. Startups looking for funding in Britain may be the hardest hit in the short-term, however. With financial uncertainty now descending upon what is otherwise a foremost FinTech hub of the world, investors are already finding it harder to justify backing startups in the country.\n\nRyan Selkis of TBI consulting was looking for higher returns than what we saw since the vote, and feels that we didn’t get them because Bitcoin still doesn’t have enough recognition by the public at large.\n\n- Ryan Selkis, Founder TBI consulting\n\nHowever, six percent is just the post-vote increase. As Spencer Jakab pointed out on his Wall Street Journal blog, the real improvement in bitcoin\'s price could be much higher. ""When the leave vote took the lead and markets flipped, Bitcoin jumped. Between its trough at midday in New York Thursday and 2:00 a.m. when the outcome became official it surged by over 20%,"" he explained, and then compared it to the improvement of Gold trading in the same format. ""GLD, from trough to peak, appreciated by just 5.4% as of mid-morning.""\n\nOthers noted that the price has other news driving it up. Wedbush Securities\' Gil Luria pointed out that the price jump is about more than just the Brexit. He mentioned China\'s ongoing insecurity with their Yuan devaluation as being the biggest driver in price, and the upcoming block reward halving event as being another. According to Luria, the Brexit fits in as part of ""general uncertainty and fear"" that helps bitcoin in general. ""Brexit is just the latest example of this,"" the stock analyst explained.\n\n- Gil Luria, Wedbush Securities\n\nGiven time, the Brexit could help bitcoin in another way; by removing the EU regulations that are more strict than Britons would allow.\n\n- Marc Andreessen, General Partner Andreessen Horowitz\n\n', 'Criminals have started staging phishing campaigns having discovered that Bitcoin can provide an easier way to steal, says Cisco’s OpenDNS security team after they revealed a complex phishing scheme aimed at collecting user credentials from various Bitcoin-related services.\n\nThe discovery was made after the price of the digital currency rose by over 58% to reach about $775 in the last month (though it has dropped in a week) based on several factors. The latter includes the finite and constrained supply of Bitcoin, its pending supply growth reduction next month, the anticipated supply drop which will drive demand and more people using and wanting Bitcoin.\n\nAdWords campaigns drove traffic towards the phishing pages\n\nThe recent Bitcoin frenzy, the team says, drew the attention of traders, economists and bankers as well as criminals.\n\nThe team says on their website:\n\n“Thus, we were not too surprised when on June 9 2016 OpenDNS detected with our model NLPRank a new phishing attack on the domain Blockchain[.info] wallet targeting the cloud-based Bitcoin wallet company blockchain[.] info.”\n\nThey noted that the first signs of the phishing campaign were noticed by security researchers from Cyren at the beginning June, when a phishing campaign utilizing the domain blocklchain[.]info as its web address began to spread using Google AdWords.\n\n""Blockchain"" or ""bioklchain""?\n\nCyren says it detected the investment pattern of a phishing campaign - rental of botnets, purchase of exploit kits, and the acquisition of compromised site lists - as its attack vector is pay-per-click advertising via Google AdWords.\n\nThe security researchers from CYREN explain:\n\n“The Ad showed up in response to searches for ‘Blockchain’ – a Bitcoin related term. Close analysis of the advert shows that the link is actually to bioklchain.info – but at a casual glance the link appears to lead to the legitimate ‘blockchain.info.’ Interestingly, Bitcoin addresses are Base58Check encoded so they exclude potentially confusing characters such as 0 (number zero), O (capital o), l (lower L), I (capital i), and the symbols ‘\\+\' and ‘/,\'”,.”\n\nIn effect, ‘bioklchain’ leads to a fake ‘blockchain’ login page for unwary victims to use the phishing page in which only has one working link – the ‘login now’ button.\n\nDoes Google know about the abuse of AdWords?\n\nCyren claims that Google is aware of this sort of abuse of AdWords with the search giant having claimed it has blocked 7,000 phishing sites which tried to use AdWords in 2015.\n\nThe OpenDNS Labs detected blolkchain[.]com which was another phish on the same IP 89.248.171.88 June 13 2016.

SegWit remains in developer testing and will be officially released – for wider testing – in an upcoming release candidate. Major benefits include lower protocol network traffic, less block space consumption, and the elimination of malleability. The outcome is that the Core code will run more efficiently and consume less computing resources (such as CPU and storage), thereby, allowing more users to run their own full validation nodes. The world’s largest super-computer, the best of modern coding plus decentralization and security gains.\n\nThere are currently no clear buy or sell signals in the chart and we stick with the longer timeframe 1-day candle chart.\n\nFibonacci extensions drawn from the initial advancing wave, of January 2015, show significant price levels at 1.618, 2.618 and, recently, 3.618 (purple arrow). Hence, the advance had targeted a level in the vicinity of a Fib extension defined 17 months ago, and last week’s correction had hit both a 0.618 Fib retracement of the advance (discussed in yesterday’s post), as well as the 2.618 Fib extension of the initial 2015 wave from the decline bottom. These Fib extensions should continue exerting an influence (at 4.618, 5.618, etc not shown) as the advance proceeds.\n\nSpeaking of advance, traders are reminded of the indicator conditions that typically manifest at the start of a significant wave of advance. As pointed out earlier in the week, magenta circles highlight the state of the grouped stochastics at the start of advance. This particular oscillator was devised and coded by myself, and is shown at xbt.social, yet CCN readers can see the same behavior in an ordinary MACD indicator (top): price tends to launch into a large advance only when MACD has returned to its zero line, or (following strong decline) after tagging its lower Bollinger Band.\n\nThe current state of the indicators imply that the present upside wave is a correction – a B-wave – and not the start of a rally to new highs.\n\nThe uppermost trendline of the Fibonacci fan drawn from the vicinity of the 2015 low, is currently at $1,750 straight up. Definitely something to look forward to in the coming months – preserve trading account funds by patiently waiting for that rally to be signaled.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price is losing momentum below $700 and the longer term chart’s indicators imply ongoing correction. A new low cannot be ruled out, but let’s hope for a consolidation above the 2.618 Fib level (red arrow at $560 Bitstamp) discussed above. If buyers find new vigor at current levels, then the correction could still push to $750 before resuming decline. Without clear signals it is better to observe until an obvious opportunity shows itself – and confirmed by the indicators.\n\nBitfinex Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin-price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

Venture capital backed investment in bitcoin and blockchain companies jumped from $3 million in 2011 to $474 million in 2015, CCN reported in March.

The participants included asset managers, banks, exchanges and blockchain technology firms.\n\nRichard Johnson, vice president ofGreenwich’s market structure and technology group, said the financial sector will continue putting its weight behind the technology in 2016 because the technology has started to prove itself fit to serve capital markets.\n\nIn the past 18 months, the hype behind blockchain has mushroomed even as the financial industry’s actual adoption of the technology has leveled off.\n\nAlso read: VC fintech funding sets record in 2015, fueling bitcoin and block chain growth\n\nDiscourse Grows Rational\n\nThe report noted that in 2016, a more rational discussion of blockchain technology is emerging, with market participants gaining a stronger sense of it and figuring out how to best adapt it to their markets. Financial companies are identifying use cases where the technology can be most disruptive.\n\nAsset managers are taking a back seat in supporting blockchain for the time being. But exchanges, banks and brokers are leading the charge to develop the technology in the hope that it can cut costs, lessen settlement times and assist with payments.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It\'s hard to think about much beyond Brexit this week—and we\'ll get to its sweeping security implications in just a minute—but there was plenty of ado before the UK voted to divorce the EU.\n\nLegal proceedings continue apace for convicted Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht, as prosecutors filed a nearly 200-page argument against an appeal.

It still does, but Bitcoin has crowded into that space as well. With the British pound crumbling, everyone\'s favorite cryptocurrency has hit its highest level in two years. That bump isn\'t likely to last forever, any more than the precipitous drops in global equity markets will, but provides a new potential maxim for the 21st century economy: When in doubt, blockchain.\n\nWhen the UK officially disbands from the EU–which won\'t happen for anywhere between ""a few months"" and ""two years""—Northern Ireland will find itself in a difficult position. Currently, the EU\'s open borders mean travel between Ireland and Northern Ireland is relatively unfettered. Absent that infrastructure, though, border checkpoints may well return, which would have implications both practical and symbolic; they were a mainstay of the Troubles of the late 20th century.\n\nAt least the cybersecurity industry doesn\'t seem to be fazed; a recent survey of IT security professionals found the majority expected no major difference post-Brexit. After all, the Internet doesn\'t care much about borders to begin with.', 'David Siegel is a blockchain strategist and speaker, founder of Kryptodesign.com and curator of DecentralStation.com, a place to learn about blockchain.\n\nIn this piece, Siegal attempts to help journalists understand what happened when The DAO collapsed and why he believes it\'s important for the press to get the story right.\n\nThe article will be updated on Medium as the situation develops. Disclaimer: Siegal owns a small number of DAO tokens.\n\nThe basics\n\nThe ethereum network is a network of computers all running the ethereum blockchain. The blockchain allows people to exchange tokens of value, called ether, which is currently the second most popular cryptocurrency behind bitcoin. ethereum also allows people to write and put on the network smart contracts – general-purpose code that executes on every computer in the network (currently over 6,000 computers). People then execute these programs by sending ether to them.\n\nA DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Its goal is to codify the rules and decisionmaking apparatus of an organization, eliminating the need for documents and people in governing, creating a structure with decentralized control.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nA group of people writes the smart contracts (programs) that will run the organization\n\nThere is an initial funding period, in which people add funds to the DAO by purchasing tokens that represent ownership – this is called a crowdsale, or an initial coin offering (ICO) – to give it the resources it needs.\n\nWhen the funding period is over, the DAO begins to operate.\n\nPeople then can make proposals to the DAO on how to spend the money, and the members who have bought in can vote to approve these proposals.\n\nIt’s important to understand that great care has been taken not to make these tokens into equity shares – they are more like contributions that give people voting rights but not ownership. In most cases, a DAO is not owned by anyone – it’s just software running on the ethereum network.\n\nThe very first DAO is bitcoin itself, which is governed by consensus among its core team and its mining network. All other DAOs have been launched on the ethereum platform.\n\n“The DAO” is the name of a particular DAO, conceived of and programmed by the team behind German startup Slock.it – a company building “smart locks” that let people share their things (cars, boats, apartments) in a decentralized version of Airbnb.\n\nThe DAO launched on 30th April, 2016, with a 28-day funding window.\n\nFor whatever reason, The DAO was popular, raising over $100m by 15th May, and by the end of the funding period, The DAO was the largest crowdfunding in history, having raised over $150m from more than 11,000 enthusiastic members. The DAO raised far more money than its creators expected.\n\nIt can be said that the marketing was better than the execution, for during the crowdsale, several people expressed concerns that the code was vulnerable to attack.\n\nOnce the crowdsale was over, there was much discussion of first addressing the vulnerabilities before starting to fund proposals. In particular, Stephan Tual, one of The DAO’s creators, announced on 12th June that a ""recursive call bug"" had been found in the software but that ""no DAO funds [were] at risk"".\n\nAt the time, more than 50 project proposals were waiting for The DAO’s token holders to vote on them.\n\nIt’s important to reiterate that the ethereum network has no such bugs and has been working perfectly the entire time. All networked systems are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. The ethereum network, which supports (depending on the price) around $1bn worth of ether, has not been hacked and is continuously executing many other smart contracts.\n\nEveryone who writes a smart contract knows that if it can move a large amount of cash it will be subject to attack. This particular vulnerability was discovered recently in another system, called Maker DAO, and was neutralized quickly because that DAO was still in testing.\n\nMany people feel that testing and certifying smart contracts will be an important part of keeping the ethereum ecosystem safe. You’ll find several smart-contract validation services listed at DecentralStation.com.\n\nThe Hack\n\nUnfortunately, while programmers were working on fixing this and other problems, an unknown attacker began using this approach to start draining The DAO of ether collected from the sale of its tokens.\n\nBy Saturday, 18th June, the attacker managed to drain more than 3.6m ether into a “child DAO” that has the same structure as The DAO. The price of ether dropped from over $20 to under $13.\n\nSeveral people made attempts to split The DAO to prevent more ether from being taken, but they couldn’t get the votes necessary in such a short time. Because the designers didn’t expect this much money, all the ether was in a single address (bad idea), and we believe the attacker stopped voluntarily after hearing about the fork proposal (see below). In fact, that attack, or another similar one, could continue at any time.\n\nSmart contracts are meant to be stand-alone agreements – not subject to interpretation by outside entities or jurisdictions. The code itself is meant to be the ultimate arbiter of ""the deal"" it represents. But of course, that’s an idealist (crypto-anarchist) perspective.\n\nEven before the attack, several lawyers raised concerns that The DAO overstepped its crowdfunding mandate and ran afoul of securities laws in several countries. Lawyers also pointed to its creators as potentially liable for any problems that may occur, and several expressed concern that token holders of The DAO were accepting responsibility they were likely unaware of. The DAO exists in a gray area of law and regulation.\n\nBecause the child DAO has the same structure, limitations, and vulnerabilities as the parent DAO, the ether in this newly created child DAO can’t be accessed for 28 days, as that is the initial funding period.\n\nEveryone can see the ether in this child DAO – any attempts to cash it in will trigger alarms and investigations. It could be that the attacker will never get to cash or spend a single ether of it.\n\nIt’s entirely possible that the attacker had a large short position on ether at the time of the attack, which he or she then cashed out after ether had been cut roughly in half. The attacker may already have made his money, regardless of the ether sitting in the child DAO.\n\nThere are things the Ethereum Foundation could do that may be able to nullify the ether in this DAO. That’s where things get complicated.\n\nThe Soft-Fork Proposal\n\nThe DAO contains roughly 15% of all ether, so a failure of The DAO has a negative impact on the ethereum network and its cryptocurrency.\n\nIt’s worth noting that dozens of startups are working on DAO or governance products, many smart contracts have similar vulnerabilities and building complex software using smart contracts is still in its infancy. Everyone involved has a stake in what happens next.\n\nAll eyes are on The DAO and the Ethereum Foundation, hoping for a resolution that allows the ecosystem to continue to develop as it was before.\n\nTo understand what happens next, you will need to understand blockchain basics: A network of nodes puts transactions into blocks and blocks into a single chain that represents the ""truth"" of what has happened. If two competing transactions happen at about the same time, the network resolves this conflict by choosing one and rejecting the other, so all nodes have the exact same copy of the distributed ledger.\n\nThe only way to ""rewrite history"" would be to have at least 51% of all nodes agree to such a collusion – something that has never happened in the history of bitcoin or ethereum. The goal of a decentralized network is that no one has the power to do that, or the network itself becomes untrustworthy.\n\nOn 17th June, Vitalik Buterin of the Ethereum Foundation issued a critical update, saying that the DAO was under attack and that he had worked out a solution:\n\nA software fork has been proposed, (with NO ROLLBACK; no transactions or blocks will be “reversed”) which will make any transactions that make any calls/callcodes/delegatecalls that reduce the balance of an account with code hash0x7278d050619a624f84f51987149ddb439cdaadfba5966f7cfaea7ad44340a4ba (ie. the DAO and children) lead to the transaction (not just the call, the transaction) being invalid …\n\nIn this, Buterin specifically states that he isn’t proposing to rewrite any blocks, but just to install a “switch” in the basic ethereum code that prevents moving any ether out of the DAO or its children.\n\nEffectively, this is a one-time fix (called a “fork”) for a one-time event that seals those ether into that address for all time.\n\nButerin continued:\n\n""Miners and mining pools should resume allowing transactions as normal, wait for the soft fork code and stand ready to download and run it if they agree with this path forward for the Ethereum ecosystem. DAO token holders and ethereum users should sit tight and remain calm. Exchanges should feel safe in resuming trading ETH.""\n\nIn other words, a blacklist will be built into the ethereum code to keep the bad guy from claiming his prize. In this “freezing of assets” scenario, Buterin calls for a discussion of how to help DAO token holders recover their initial investment.\n\nThis seemingly innocuous and well-meaning “Deus ex machina” proposal – which must still be adopted by a majority of ethereum network nodes to take effect – has opened a huge can of worms.\n\nThe Attacker Responds — or Does He?\n\nI will call the attacker a lone male, even though I have no idea if he is one.\n\nWhat happened next was interesting. In an open letter to The DAO and ethereum Community, the attacker supposedly claimed that his “reward” was legal and threatened to take legal action against anyone who tried to invalidate his work. Several people pointed out that the cryptographic signature in this message wasn’t valid – it could be fake.\n\nBut it’s well written, and from a certain point of view, well reasoned: The premise of smart contracts is that they are their own arbiters and that nothing outside the code can “change the rules” of the transaction.\n\nLater, through an intermediary, the attacker claimed that he would put a stop to the organized “theft” of his property by rewarding miners (nodes) who don’t go along with the proposed soft fork, saying:\n\n""[S]oon we will have a smart contract to reward miners who oppose the soft fork and mines the transaction. 1m ETH + 100 BTC will be shared with miners.""\n\nThis is clearly a complex dynamic system.\n\nThese messages from ""the attacker”""cannot be verified, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.\n\nThe Hard-Fork Proposal\n\nAnother proposal is more aggressive – to ask the miners to completely unwind the theft and return all ether to The DAO, where it can be redeemed by token holders automatically, thereby ending The DAO.\n\nAs Stephan Tual puts it in his blog …\n\n""By 4pm local time, the consensus was that should a soft fork be deployed within 27 days, the attacker would not be able to retrieve the funds he had stashed into a child DAO. A subsequent hard fork could even return all ether, including the DAO’s ‘extraBalance’ and the stolen funds, back into a smart contract. That smart contract would contain a single function: withdraw(). This would make it possible for everyone who participated in the DAO to withdraw their funds: thanks to the support of the miners, and because nothing had been spent so far, nothing would be lost.""\n\nThis has the effect of rewriting the rules by which the blockchain executes, which is supposed to be impossible. Should we let that rule slide just this one time, to put the ethereum project back on track?\n\nThe Slock.it guys and most DAO tokenholders would be grateful if we did.\n\nResponses to the soft fork\n\nSeen on its own, the proposal is reasonable. It\'s a one-time fix to a one-time problem. But many people don’t see it that way.\n\nYou can read the massive response on Reddit, which I will try to summarize:\n\nTrustworthiness of the network is sacred.\n\nAs one person on Reddit put it:\n\n""The involvement of the ethereum foundation in the DAO has been and is a mistake. As I see it ethereum is supposed to be the foundational infrastructure upon which a flurry of projects and experiments are supposed to blossom, and in order for them to blossom they need a foundation that is strong, and that has integrity in the face of challenges. The hard fork proposal is a compromise that ruins that integrity and signals that projects like the DAO can influence the underlying foundation to their own advantage. To me that is totally unacceptable and is a departure from the principles that drew me to ethereum.""\n\nThe hard fork is a valid option, but it should be kept for situations which require emergency modifications of the ethereum protocol itself, and not for projects that run on it.\n\nThe fact that the Ethereum Foundation has been involved in and promoted The DAO project has been an error and it only usurps the trust that people have in ethereum as a foundational infrastructure for other projects.\n\nI hope they will correct this error.\n\nAnother one chimed in:\n\n""I made a bad contract in the first days ETH was online and lost 2K ETH with it, can I also get it back? Thanks!""\n\nAnd finally:\n\n""Ethereum worked exactly as intended. I don’t believe software should be updated when it works exactly as intended. You assume the risks of your investment. If you don’t understand your investment, you assume unknown risk. Anything else is a bailout by a central authority, i.e. the antithesis of the crypto world. In a related way, this is why Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail – because the deal is the deal, and if you bend the rules for a particular player, all other players will want special treatment, too.""\n\nToo Big to Fail\n\nJust a month after Lehman Brothers, other banks did get special treatment, and you can decide for yourself whether that was a good idea – it’s quite analogous to the situation at hand. The DAO is not an island.\n\nIt is considered ""too big to fail"" from the point of view of the ethereum ecosystem. It may be noted that several people from the Ethereum Foundation are DAO token holders and also have advisory positions in The DAO. Even Gavin Wood, one of the original ethereum founders, supported the fork in a blog post.\n\nIn this view, then, it’s possible that some other large projects could need to be rescued and the Ethereum Foundation, having set a precedent once, may once again ask miners to rewrite history.\n\nThe analogy to the bank bailouts is remarkable: banks were able to take huge risks hoping for huge returns, and when those trades went south, the taxpayers bailed them out (except for poor Lehman Brothers). This risk asymmetry is generally thought of as a bad way to incentivize market participants.\n\nThose are the two extremes, but most people fall into one or the other. The long arm of the law, not to mention the tax man\n\nThe above discussion assumes we are operating in a vacuum, in crypto-anarchy space, where laws don’t apply. But people have invested real money and real laws can and will apply to this case.\n\nIn fact, all parties here may have legitimate claims that could take years to settle out in courts around the world.\n\nWho\'s at risk?\n\nEven though they took great care to not create securities and make sure people were aware of the risks, they still may be held liable. If the DAO token holders lose most of their $150m+ investment, a class-action suit against the originators seems likely.\n\nOther DAOs\n\n\n\nSome people have taken The DAO smart contract word for word to implement other DAOs. In the case of a hard fork, all of the ether in any DAO that uses The DAO’s 1.0 smart contracts will forfeit their ether into a refund address, to be divided among DAO token holders. Thus, DAO token holders could end up getting more than they put in. This is sure to anger those who have put their own money into their own DAOs using The DAO 1.0 code.\n\nDAO tokenholders\n\n\n\nAs investors, and without the protection of a corporation, all 11,000+ DAO token holders may be seen as general partners in the fund. In that case, the attacker can sue individual DAO token holders in their own home jurisdictions, claiming that they represent the entity that seized his rightful property.\n\nThe Exchanges\n\n\n\nNot long after the initial funding period, several cryptocurrency exchanges began making markets in DAO tokens.\n\nAs part of the chain, anyone who bought DAO tokens from any exchange may sue the exchange for selling flawed investments. This could go very deep – to the level of securities law violations, or they could simply be liable for the profit they made on the tokens.\n\nGiven that several exchanges have plenty of cash, they could be among the first targets.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has a lot at stake here. They want the network to be rock solid, to support billions of dollars worth of commerce, and to be ""the operating system of the future"".\n\nBut now they are between a rock and a hard place: if they do nothing, the ethereum network suffers a setback that could take years to recover from; if they intervene, they set a dangerous precedent that erodes the social contract they set up with their network of independent nodes.\n\nThey didn’t design the ethereum network to be the judge and jury in case one or more parties are injured.\n\nMiners and nodes\n\n\n\nThe 6,000+ full ethereum nodes may be liable for any forks they vote for.\n\nIf the attacker can be seen as having acquired his ether as a result of a ""feature"" of a smart contract, then he may (and has already threatened to) sue any of the miners that try to take what he feels is rightfully his away from him. He could also sue the Ethereum Foundation if they write the software that implements the fork.\n\nOn the other hand, DAO token holders could sue nodes that don’t vote for the fork, claiming that they aren’t doing the right thing. On the other hand, people running nodes like money, and they may get money from ""the attacker"" not to fork. It’s entirely possible that governments will step in here and try to make big changes in the governance of the Ethereum system.\n\nThe attacker\n\n\n\nThe attacker may already have made a substantial sum via market manipulation – this is illegal in many jurisdictions. He also may have a huge tax liability. There is obviously a tremendous incentive for the community to learn his identity and ""out"" him.\n\nThere is probably enough information out there for people to figure out who he is – it may just be a matter of time before they do.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIt seems at this point that The DAO will die, and that DAO token holders will get somewhere between 0% and 100% of their ether back.\n\nIt’s safe to say that the Slock.it guys have their hands full for a while, they may not get their project funded (I’m told they put quite a bit of their own money into The DAO), and they may be talking with lawyers for months.\n\nThe DAO is still subject to another similar attack.\n\nVitalik can propose an ethereum-based solution, but the nodes must decide. It’s not clear which of these paths the nodes will take. Many people say that ""doing nothing is perhaps the worst option"". It depends which side of various fences you’re on. There are slippery slopes everywhere.\n\nThere’s another wrinkle: The Ethereum Foundation is on track to switch to a new consensus mechanism called ""proof of stake"", and in that scenario, anyone who owns 14% of all ether will have tremendous control over the future blockchain.\n\nIn fact, Vitalik has asked for projects to have a limit of $10m or so, to help contain the magnitude of unintended errors.\n\nIt’s also very likely that there will be lawsuits. We could see a total mess, with lawsuits extending for many years. Or we could see a fairly neat and tidy ending, ethereum goes on and “the attacker” never surfaces again.\n\nThough I would bet 5 ether that the attacker will be found within a month or two. Even though the letter and the spirit of smart contracts is that “smart contracts rule,” and the rule of law doesn’t apply – in this case, most people would like to see a do-over. I’m guessing we will see various rules of law apply.\n\nI have tried to stick with the facts, and now I will offer one simple opinion: This situation will resolve itself well if the attacker will simply buy a bunch of ether, then agree to work with The DAO people to return the money to all tokenholders and dissolve The DAO completely.\n\nThe attacker will have made some money, made his point, no lawyers will be involved, we will all have learned a hard lesson, and the Ethereum Foundation can start planning for a safer, more resilient future.\n\nSummary\n\nI believe we can say that this event marks the beginning of a new era of ethereum’s public blockchain.\n\nWhile the agile approach of ""ready, fire, aim"" generally works best with new software, it can be dangerous when $150m gets loaded into the chamber.\n\nEthereum was billed as a general-purpose computer and the harbinger of a new decentralized model for computing and for society. We will see, a bit sooner than we may have wanted, how all this plays out in the real world.\n\nSome resources:\n\nDAOs, DACs, and More – by Vitalik Buterin\n\nHow to Build a Democracy on the Blockchain – by the Ethereum Foundation\n\nThe DAO, The Fork, The Fallout – A group discussion\n\nThis post originally appeared on Medium and has been republished with the author\'s permission.\n\nTypewriter image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

LSD, Cannabis, MDMA, and novel substances mark the top five of purchased narcotics on the dark net.\n\nThe dark net has always been one of those places where Bitcoin is most commonly used for transactions. Although the dark net is filled with marketplaces where illegal goods and services are bought and sold, it always played a key role in Bitcoin usage. A new survey shows how more people shop for drugs on the dark net, which is not overly positive news for Bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nThe Global Drug Survey 2016 collected data between November 2015 and January 2016. There was a large focus on the involvement of the dark net in online drug trafficking. As most people are well aware, underground marketplaces are the most common place to buy and sell drugs. Bitcoin is the preferred method of payment, due to its – minimal – privacy protection and global availability.\n\nThe Dark Net Is The Place To Be For Drugs\n\nPart of the survey focuses on how more and more drug users flock to the dark net to find their next fix. Nearly 10% of all participants admitted they use anonymity software to access parts of the Internet not indexed by search engines. The sale of drugs on these marketplaces has been increasing significantly compared to the year before.\n\nInterestingly enough, the most commonly purchased drugs are not what people would assume. LSD, Cannabis, MDMA, and novel substances mark the top five of purchased narcotics on the dark net. Cocaine or heroin is often found on these marketplaces as well, but due to its expensive nature, it is not something most people tend to buy in bulk.\n\nIn a more worrisome trend, 5% of the survey respondents indicated they had never used drugs before purchasing it from the dark net. Technology is not to blame for this mind shift, although many people see it as a facilitator. In the end, the decision to use drugs is still made by the individual, regardless of how easy or hard it is to obtain the goods.\n\nBitcoin remains the payment method of preference among dark net users. Albeit the report doesn’t touch upon the subject directly, it is public knowledge. If it had not been for Silk Road, Bitcoin might have never gotten to be as popular as it is today. Nor is Bitcoin to blame for the rise in dark net purchases, as individual users make those decisions themselves.\n\nSource: Global Drug Survey\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Jacob Eliosoff is a computer programmer who has also worked as a Wall Street quant and as a teacher. These days he runs Calibrated Markets LLC, a cryptocurrency algorithmic trading firm.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Eliosoff takes on the difficult task of explaining next-generation blockchain platform ethereum in everyday terms, outlining its strengths and weaknesses, and how these position it within the wider framework of blockchain innovation.\n\nThere are plenty of articles about ethereum\'s recent DAO drama and its wild price swings, but fewer try to explain to non-geeks how ethereum’s technology could matter for everyday life – and in particular, what it offers that bitcoin doesn\'t.\n\nLet\'s walk through a concrete example: “slocks”, the Internet-ready locks being developed by now-infamous German startup Slock.it. Suppose you want to rent out your apartment while you’re on vacation.\n\nAirbnb works fine, but it has drawbacks, like:\n\nFees. Airbnb charges 9-15%.\n\nAirbnb charges 9-15%. Handing off the key. What if you’re on an airplane? What if you have two guests staying one after the other? How do you prevent guest number 1 from entering during guest number 2\'s stay?\n\nWhat if you’re on an airplane? What if you have two guests staying one after the other? How do you prevent guest number 1 from entering during guest number 2\'s stay? Limited payment options. If the guest doesn’t have an international credit or debit card, booking through Airbnb can be hard or even impossible. This may not seem like a big deal, but keep in mind that in many countries getting those cards is much harder.\n\nOne way to cut out Airbnb is to let your guest arrange the logistics – booking, payment, deposit, checking in and out – directly with the door lock itself. This requires a lock that isn’t just ""smart"" (electronic), but one that can handle these interactions with guests over the Internet, on terms specified by the host.\n\nThe guys at Slock.it call this a slock:\n\nWithout Airbnb, hosts and guests still need some kind of marketplace where they can find each other. In the slock framework, this is called the Universal Sharing Network (USN). So, the guest agrees to the terms for the rental listed on the USN, sends payment to the host\'s slock, the slock grants door access and when the guest checks out the slock revokes his access and is ready for the next guest.\n\nYou can see Slock.it’s live demo of this at Devcon1 last November.\n\nThat’s a big-picture example of how ethereum could affect everyday life. Guests no longer need to deal directly with the host, or even with a company like Airbnb. Instead they deal with the USN (to find the room), and with the host\'s slock (to pay and get in). The host can enjoy her vacation, and while the USN charges a fee, it’s more like 1-2% than Airbnb’s 9-15%.\n\nHow can the USN charge so much less? Because it’s a robot. And its owner’s a robot, too.\n\nWhere does ethereum fit in here?\n\nThat first diagram glossed over a bunch of subtleties.\n\nHere’s a more detailed look:\n\nPerhaps the most frequent confusion here is that the slock isn’t actually a single piece of hardware – nor is it what Slock.it makes or sells! The slock is what you get by combining a standard consumer smart lock, like the Danalock unit in Slock.it’s demo, with an ""Ethereum Computer"", a small device able to communicate both with the lock (via industry-standard protocols like Z-Wave or ZigBee) and with the USN and its listings and contracts.\n\nIt’s the latter piece, the Ethereum Computer, that constitutes Slock.it’s product. The remaining magic – and here we get to ethereum’s true role – is that the USN marketplace isn’t just a cheaper knockoff of Airbnb, but something fundamentally different.\n\nThe USN isn’t a company. It doesn’t even have staff! It’s automated, a computer program.\n\nBut it’s not even a regular computer program. Really it’s a bunch of programs – each rental listing is its own program, for instance, sending and receiving payments according to the logic programmed into it: deposit amount, checkout time and so on.\n\nAnd unlike, say, Airbnb’s website, these programs don’t run on any specific server but rather on many computers, ""nodes"" connected to form a decentralized network (like BitTorrent). This network is ethereum, and the special, payment-slinging programs it\'s running are also known as smart contracts.\n\nThese smart contracts can both send and receive payments, to and from both people (guests and hosts) and each other. But they do this not via the credit card or bank networks, but via the ethereum network itself, and not in dollars or euros but in ether (ETH), ethereum’s own digital currency.\n\nPayments between the guest, the slock and the host are in ether, though the USN may list prices in dollars and convert at purchase time using the current rate, like an FX rate. Currently 1 ETH is worth about $14, up from less than $1 in December, which explains a lot of the hype.\n\nThe final bit of alphabet soup we haven’t touched on yet is The DAO.\n\nThe DAO is a tangled tale and pretty much burnt to the ground last Friday, but for here, suffice to say that The DAO is an entity that owns the USN and pockets the 1-2% rental fees above. It, too, is neither flesh-and-blood, brick-and-mortar, nor CEO-and-lawyer, but yet another smart contract running on ethereum.\n\nWhy not bitcoin?\n\nThe big question you’d run into with bitcoin is – where does the Airbnb-type software run? There has to be some program receiving bookings via the USN, checking in guests, refunding deposits and so on. What hardware would it run on?\n\nIn ethereum, the answer is that this software, in the form of smart contracts, runs on the computers participating in the network. Running these contracts is what it means to run an Ethereum “node”, much like running BitTorrent means agreeing to store and distribute BitTorrent files.\n\nSo, buying one of Slock.it’s “Ethereum Computers” lets you run the Airbnb software, or any other smart contract. That same node might also run software to rent out your car, or run an online casino, or conduct an election. That’s why Slock.it call it an “Ethereum Computer” rather than just a “Slock Computer” - it’s general-purpose. Bitcoin nodes aren’t like this: they only run a specific kind of program, which pretty much just lets you send money.\n\nSo, either you\'d run the ""Bitbnb"" software on a separate server of your own (or on a special-purpose ""Bitbnb Computer""), or you’d need someone to build a layer on top of bitcoin that supports smart contracts, the way the web is a layer built on top of the Internet.\n\nCounterparty and RootStock are two smart-contract projects building on top of bitcoin this way. But, Counterparty bundles its state (how much the guest owes you, etc) into bitcoin transactions, which weren’t designed for this purpose.\n\nThis also limits Counterparty transactions to bitcoin’s 10-minute block time, rather than ethereum’s 15-second one. Meanwhile, RootStock is far behind ethereum in development, arguably falling further behind every day, and involves some technical challenges (how to reliably transfer coins between the bitcoin blockchain and RootStock blockchain) that don’t appear to be fully worked out yet.\n\nIn both cases, you’re now dependent on two separate networks and technologies: bitcoin, and Counterparty or RootStock.\n\nSo yes, you could do it with bitcoin. But it gets clunky.\n\nIt’s a bit like saying, you can turn a wall clock into an alarm clock, by attaching a device that detects the positions of the hands and rings a bell. But why not just own a smartphone, and download an alarm app? That’s the power of a general-purpose computer.\n\nNot quite a sure thing\n\nEthereum can do things bitcoin can’t, but there are still umpteen ways both the slock idea and ethereum itself could fail to get traction.\n\nHardware. Slock.it is in the hardware game, and hardware is tough. We’ve seen from ASIC manufacturers how tricky this is.\n\nSlock.it is in the hardware game, and hardware is tough. We’ve seen from ASIC manufacturers how tricky this is. Network effect.

Shortage of use cases. Few of the many proposed ethereum use cases seem likely to win over customers anytime soon: slocks are one of the most persuasive I’ve seen, and they’re pretty esoteric.

Given that bitcoin has simple, compelling uses like remittances and online purchases, yet has still struggled with user adoption, one wonders how many people actually want to eat what the ethereum chefs are cooking. The DAO is a mess. While I see ethereum as a good idea that may not pan out, and slocks as a riskier but still plausible business plan, The DAO made me shake my head even before its tragicomic undoing last weekend. Beyond the superficial bugs, it suffers from numerous incentive problems and its premise – that crowds are good at deciding how to invest capital – seems fundamentally wrong. And even if it did make good investments, calling shares “tokens” was just not going to fool the SEC.\n\nSome predictions\n\nBut, then again opining about a technology without making any concrete predictions is mighty easy.\n\nSo here are a few:\n\nUnlike most cryptocoins, which will gradually fade away, at least one of bitcoin and ethereum is here to stay – though quite possibly not both. By the end of 2017, either BTC will hit $2,000 or ETH will hit $120.\n\nDespite bitcoin’s head-start, unless its developers start healing their divisions, ethereum’s market cap will surpass it by end of 2017. Right now, ethereum looks on track to adopt proof-of-stake before bitcoin supports 10 transactions per second. That is an embarrassing reflection on their paces of development.\n\nThe DAO is dead: Even if it pulls through this month’s crisis, further technical and regulatory minefields await. The “hard fork” plan will carry the day, returning its investors’ ether (though 20+% of them won’t even get around to withdrawing it), but that will be the end of it. Slock.it are a likely casualty as well, their funding model and credibility in shreds. But ethereum will lick its wounds and carry on.\n\nEthereum and bitcoin adoption will remain piecemeal. Contrary to 2013\'s dreams, this is a game of decades, not months. When it does come, adoption won’t spread gradually but will suddenly take off in one or two centers of activity. For bitcoin some candidates are Philippine remittances, Chinese or Venezuelan capital control evaders, online poker sites or of course the next big Silk Road. For ethereum it’s still early, but projects like Slock.it that “disrupt the disruptors” (Airbnb, Uber, etc) seem most straightforward.\n\nAlthough harder to measure than price, the most important yardstick for ethereum is user adoption.\n\nLike bitcoin, ethereum has some paths to success that don’t rely on users: for example, sovereign wealth funds could start diversifying into cryptocurrencies. But to succeed as a technology, ethereum needs non-geeks to start using it, not because they think it’s cool but because it fulfills some practical need better than the alternatives.\n\nThe bitcoin precedent is somewhat depressing: over seven years bitcoin has won many fans – techies, libertarians, speculators, venture capitalists, vendors – but few regular users. Ethereum’s success probably depends less on transforming society in 20 years than on making someone’s life easier now.\n\nOverwhelmed visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Read more...\n\nIndia is one of the largest cash dependent nations in the world. A majority of people in the world’s largest democracy have the tendency to use cash for most of the transactions. This has created a challenge for the Indian central bank —The Reserve Bank of India to maintain the liquidity in the country’s monetary system. In order to ensure there are enough bank notes to go around, the premier bank is forced to print more currency and constantly destroy the old banknotes that are either soiled or damaged.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India, in order to reduce its expenses and to ensure better accountability has been actively promoting the transition to a cashless society by urging people to make use of electronic payments systems like credit and debit cards. But that is not enough, as the country with over 1.25 billion in population has only 643.19 million debit cards and 22.74 million credit cards in use (as on December 2015). Even though a majority of the population have debit cards, most of the debit card transactions happen on ATM machines, used to withdraw cash and only 10 percent of merchants across the country have PoS terminals. The low penetration of electronic payment systems and cash maintenance and operations is costing the Indian banking sector about $3.5 billion a year.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India along with the National Payments Corporation of India has also introduced a domestic card payments scheme called RuPay, on par with MasterCard and Visa networks for domestic card usage. RuPay in collaboration with Discover Financial enables international payments using RuPay powered cards. However, the results have left much to be desired. In order to further streamline the process of migration from cash-dominant society to a cashless society, the Reserve Bank of India is now looking into the adoption of Blockchain technology.\n\nYesterday, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India HR Khan has announced the central bank’s intentions of forming a committee to study the usage of blockchain technology to reduce the use of paper currency. He was quoted by one of the leading Indian publication saying –\n\n“Blockchain is one thing that has come out of Bitcoin which provides a lot of flexibility in terms of financial transactions. So, we need to study… how this Blockchain technology can be used in financial transactions where the entire data systems move to some more levels,”\n\nThe announcement was made at a press conference organized during an event organized by the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT). By reducing the usage of paper currency, the Reserve bank of India will not only be able to reduce the costs associated with printing, transport and maintenance of the currency notes in circulation but it will also be able to effectively combat counterfeiting of Indian currency notes.\n\nCounterfeit currency notes have been one of the longstanding issues faced by the Indian financial system. The country receives a large number of fake currency notes smuggled across the border from neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh, forcing the banks and even people to be extra cautious while accepting currency notes of large denomination. With the use of blockchain based digital Indian rupee, the counterfeiting issue can be resolved effectively.\n\nThe Indian central bank’s initiative to set up a committee to study blockchain technology doesn’t come as a surprise as the Reserve Bank has been hinting about the use of Bitcoin technology in the past.""]"

It is the “one last economic fortress”.\n\nCryptocurrencies go where big banks won’t trouble to go, but could the Blockchain also provide wealth for the unbanked by providing jobs in the near future? The western world has by now has been significantly disrupted by the blockchains of Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other currencies and tokens.\n\nAccording to the 2014 Global Findex, 700 million adults worldwide became account holders between 2011 and 2014; a 20 percent drop in the number of unbanked.\n\nJim Yong Kim, World Bank Group President, says:\n\n“Access to financial services can serve as a bridge out of poverty. We have set a hugely ambitious goal – universal financial access by 2020 – and now we have evidence that we’re making major progress.”\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to experts about whether they think it is only a matter of time before the blockchain affects the developing world, or if they think It has already started.\n\nWhat is money?\n\nNicolas Dorier, NBitcoin Developer, explains to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Money is only a fluid which make people collaborate better together. But we can imagine an application on top of Bitcoin similar to Amazon like mechanical turk which would work in an unbanked world, which currently can't work in the fiat world.”\n\nLawrence Lundy, Developer at Outlier Ventures Ltd, notes that it is already happening with sites like wework.com and fiverr.com, as they give opportunities to people to create jobs.\n\nChris Kitze, CEO at Safe Cash Payment Technologies, Inc, comments:\n\n“I think it's definitely possible, but it will require new thinking about what money is and how it's created. If people can do useful labor and create a unit of exchange using crypto and the PKI, it could definitely be possible.”\n\nBlockchain is a game changer\n\nJohn Gotts, Chairman and CEO of FamilyOffice.VC, says that they have companies that want to help the unbanked using the Blockchain and it seems to be working.\n\nFreya Stevens, Marketing Specialist at Stratis Blockchain Solution, revealed to CoinTelegraph that Stratis is creating a full node in C# .NET, making them the first cloud-based blockchain service provider to do so. The company is primarily focused on the Blockchain provisioning for the business community in an increasingly digital economy.\n\nShe says about the Bitcoin Blockchain:\n\n“Blockchain is a game changer but there is still a real need to lower the barriers to entry so that more people can get involved with the technology, discover it’s utility and ultimately be able to compete in a changing marketplace. Stratis aims to make blockchain more widely available to both developers and to businesses - helping them to stay ahead of the curve, plus creating more jobs.”\n\nBe your own bank\n\nLiana Douillet Guzmán, VP, Marketing and Communications at Blockchain.info, says that the Blockchain can provide real meaning and value to the financial lives of the approximately 2.5 billion un- and underbanked citizens of the world – in a number of ways.\n\nFor instance, the unbanked can leverage the cost and technology benefits of blockchain technology for less costly, more transparent money exchanges.\n\nShe notes that the Blockchain can also help the under-banked formalize property rights where land title remains questionable. Here, the Blockchain can not only allow for less costly land titling, but it can enable those landowners to, for the first time, enter the financial system and generate collateral.\n\nDouillet Guzmán concludes:\n\n“Finally, the Blockchain can help the unbanked by allowing them to “be your own bank” which can offer individuals access to job opportunities – and payment from – corporations around the globe.”\n\nSo, on one hand, we have the “Internet of Things”, the infrastructure of our information society, by which the Blockchain disrupts the finance sector, while on the other hand, we may also witness disruption in the sense of how we create jobs through and by the “Internet of Manpower”."", '', 'The rapid depreciation of the British Pound has resulted in Forex companies like Thomas Cook imposing restrictions on the sale of foreign currencies. Bitcoin offers a better way out for ordinary residents.\n\nImpact of rapid depreciation\n\nFor the common man, there is little he can do if his currency is subject to sudden depreciation. With the pound hitting a historical low, the British can only watch passively as their sterling-denominated assets lose value. The price of imported goods (like oil) and goods benchmarked to international markets (like gold) will increase in GBP terms. If they want to avoid incurring losses, they will have to sell their pounds for either gold or foreign currencies like the Euro or the US dollar.\n\nForeign exchange impact\n\nA spokesperson for Thomas Cook, Britain\'s biggest travel operator, said\n\n“We have temporarily suspended our travel money website following unprecedented customer demand for foreign currency overnight and this morning. Our immediate priority is to ensure that we have enough currency in store to fulfill outstanding orders.""\n\nThomas Cook is not the only currency exchange to have suspended selling foreign currencies for the pound. According to CNN, Australia\'s Commerce Bank, too, had suspended the exchange of pounds for foreign currencies by individual customers.\n\nInstitutional traders benefit\n\nWhile the pound sterling is supposed to be one of the most liquid currencies in the world, individual customers were still denied access to move out of the pound when they needed it the most. Most institutional investors use automated programs to take positions on unfolding events and were able to execute trades quickly. Some hedge funds took a call on Brexit and shorted the pound beforehand, generating large profits when Brexit occurred and the pound depreciated.\n\nBitcoin best choice for individuals\n\nBitcoin provides one of the few means available to the common man to quickly convert his pounds to alternate assets. According to Bloomberg, the volume of Bitcoin trades at Kraken (the world\'s largest Bitcoin exchange in Euro volume) has doubled. From Nigeria to Venezuela, Bitcoin has the ability to give ordinary residents a quick way to escape rapid currency depreciation.', 'The bitcoin price chart is slumping and a potential drop lower edges to the edge of support.

By the same token, the market may surprise us by just selling straight through the zone, but let’s anticipate a struggle in this chart area and only enter once the support has been decisively broken.\n\nA sell entry below $634 (inside the support zone) would be an opportune moment to open a position.\n\nIf price sells through support then reasonable targets would be at the 200MA (red) level of $600, and near the previous low of $560. If $560 and $550 both give way then the $500 psych level beckons.\n\nAn alternative – short-term bullish – scenario is that support might hold and that another upside wave to above $700 can unfold in a Sunday rally or an end-of-month-Monday-morning-salary-buying spree. We don’t currently have a signal for such an outcome but we’ll watch out for this scenario.\n\nSummary\n\nSince bitcoin price remains below the 1-day chart’s 20MA, speculators should consider a funds allocation of 40:60 BTC vs fiat until we see a confirmation of a return to uptrend. Margin traders should remain patient for today’s signal to become glaringly obvious before committing to a sell position. The bulls have much confidence due to the assumption that Friday’s Brexit outcome is a bullish signal that will keep the chart advancing.

All the focus and energy is going into determining the right way to rebuild the global financial infrastructure. In the rush to take down banking, and be more like bankers in the process, the core mission of the bitcoin project seems to have been left behind.\n\nMany startups have tried selling bitcoin to the masses as an alternative to fiat currency, and they’ve largely failed, pivoting to infrastructure or trying to redefine bitcoin.\n\nNow, we’ll see some of the usual suspects try to sell it to Wall Street as an investment product – an asset class. This is already true in places like China but, as we well know, the entire bitcoin project was envisioned, designed, built and released as a peer-to-peer value exchange system. It wasn’t supposed to be a standalone asset class or a messaging system for banks.\n\nMeanwhile, the original tokens, the bitcoins themselves, are increasing in value again.\n\nBut the industry, eyes large with impressing bankers and avoiding regulators wrath, knowingly or not, designed access to bitcoin for specific audiences while trying to stay true to a very specific political vision of how bitcoin must be used and by whom.\n\nUsing bitcoin means clunky QR codes, weird wallets and addresses, price volatility and confusion. The recent ethereum DAO ""contract hack"" will of course throw shade on all crypto as Mt Gox is still fresh in collective memory. But we’ve seen disaster after disaster and somehow the value of bitcoin has survived, thrived, and steadily risen year-over-year since inception.\n\nThe adoption question\n\nUltimately, bitcoin is winning. So, the question remains, are we on the verge of mass consumer adoption but just in a slightly different way than we imagined?\n\nXapo CEO Wences Casares and many other really smart people have their own distillation of this thing – ""bitcoin is the best form of money ever invented"". That might be true. But, it also might just be the best store of value ever invented, a true form of ""digital gold"" as Nathaniel Popper holds.\n\nThink about gold for a second. Gold is portable, hard to counterfeit, impossible to ""double spend"". It takes effort to mine, and it looks good. Gold has historically been the best store of value ever used and in many ways it still is. But, bitcoin has nearly all these properties and one more. While you can’t wear it, you also can’t just rip it off my neck or wrist and run.\n\nIn fact, if someone manages the digital equivalent of a chain snatching the whole network falls apart, destroying the very value that drives the urge to steal it in the first place.\n\nSo, why haven’t tens of millions of people with Internet connected devices bought a nugget or a dash of it? Why hasn’t the world at large tried putting $10 into it? People buy other volatile things. They buy the aforementioned precious metals.\n\nThey buy gold and silver that’s fashioned into fashionable things and wear it. It’s a status symbol. It has visual meaning. You can touch it. We all agree it has value. It’s value goes up and down based on global markets.\n\nPeople buy stocks and bonds that don’t have a physical representation. They obsessively check their portfolios all over the world. And they gamble. Billions of people have thrown much, much more into a slot machine or on the floor for a roll of the dice.\n\nBitcoin is arguably safer than all of these things yet it still hasn’t reached mass adoption. Why? What’s holding it back?\n\nLooks matter\n\nI think user experience is playing a bigger role than we think.\n\nSixteen years ago, I started my career at an innovative boutique design agency called OVEN Digital, as the director of UX and that was where and when I made my bones in this business.\n\nOVEN, before I joined, made a reputation for building the first web site for MOMA and beat 40 other agencies to get one of the most coveted e-commerce agency jobs to that point – Tiffany & Co. The website cost quite a lot to build. No one believed that you could sell jewelry on a website.\n\nBut, as we discovered and our leadership loved to brag – the site paid for itself in 6 weeks. It did so for a variety of reasons, but our graphic designers and rich media teams were amazing, better at UX than I’ll ever be because they knew that when you have great products you crank up the white space, show nice photos and get out of the way.\n\nFunny, in 16 years the UI and aesthetic of Tiffany.com really hasn’t changed that much:\n\nNow take a look at BTC-e, one of the highest volume bitcoin and crypto exchanges in the world.\n\nIt looks like the Bloomberg terminal’s younger, less with-it brother. Also a massively successful product, but the UX is all about trading. It’s all about feeling like a Wall Street product, it’s for traders and speculators and wannabes.\n\nThen, if you go inside Coinbase, it’s clean, sure, but again it’s faceless. It feels like I just walked into a bank.\n\nAll the safeguards and the delays in deposits, trade execution, withdrawals, etc are akin to the huge stone edifices of old bank branches and bars on the teller windows that say, ""I’ve got the power, you should feel so lucky your money is here"".\n\nAnd given the big slip-ups in the early days of bitcoin, that’s a natural reaction, it’s human nature to want my money or my ""valuables"" in a safety deposit box that curls up like a porcupine. But, we already give money, paper, e-cash, etc, value. We give stocks and bonds value.\n\nWe know because we see everyone else use it and we can track our stocks in our IRAs on a website or on CNBC.\n\nReaching utopia\n\nPeople, regular people, haven’t joined the speculative gamble or fun of bitcoin because we in the industry have violated one of the most basic user experience principles – ""Don’t make me think.""\n\nIf a product is good enough it sells itself.\n\nSure we’re hampered by regulation, but more than that we’re too much in a rush to merge proof-of-stake with proof-of-work and make cross-border trading insurance products work.\n\nWe may have created a layer of anxiety that\'s covering how great the actual product really is.\n\nWe’re in too much of a rush to usher in a utopian financial era that we forgot to take a breath, stop, look at what’s there and appreciate what an amazing thing bitcoin is. If we did, we might figure out how to sell it. And if we figure out how to sell it we might be able to bring about the utopian vision we all so secretly want.\n\nI’m not saying we need a physical object or a mascot. I am saying that we can do better.\n\nWallet to wallet transaction UX is ridiculous for micropayments. All the decimal places make no sense to even smarter-than-average and more-tolerant-than-average people. We can make it much more accessible.\n\nEven with all the KYC/AML and the onboarding nightmare users have with exchanges – when we want something, we fight through stuff like that to get it. Every product has constraints. Every app requires some kind of registration and onboarding.\n\nVenmo sure does, but it took off because it solved a problem that humans have and people have no trouble going through the steps to sign up, link a bank account and wait days to deposit and withdraw money from it. There’s a big UX Problem with the exchanges and the wallets. We can solve it.\n\nWe can absolutely do better if we try new approaches on the front end. And these approaches can absolutely stay true to the mission of the community but there will be some trade offs. But it’s worth it if we get millions of new users.\n\nWe need a ""Jobs"" to go with all our Wozniaks. Bitcoin is way too cool and amazing for us to hide it’s full value.\n\nDirty stove image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Martin Hagelstrom is a bitcoin enthusiast, project executive and consultant working on IT projects at IBM.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Hagelstrom looks at how bitcoin can grow to mass adoption in a market full of digital payments systems run by tech and finance giants. While the choices are varied, one thing the industry needs is focus, he says.\n\nThere is a very public war being waged between Apple, Google, Samsung, Amazon and several banks, with the weapons of choice being their respective mobile wallets.\n\nAnd for a good reason – whoever controls the payment user experience will own the customer.\n\nThe person who uses Apple Pay doesn't really care if they are actually using a credit card from Bank A or Bank B. In fact, they could switch banks with no friction, as their payment experience would not change.\n\nSo, the underlying financial technology has become a commodity and the wallet provider not only keeps a piece of that transaction, but they can also start offering functionalities that were previously exclusive to the banks.\n\nWhich way forward?\n\nBitcoin has two options here: to become yet another underlying payment routing system for these wallets to use, or to compete with them and seek to control the end-to-end experience.\n\nDon’t get me wrong – both strategies would produce huge growth for bitcoin. Being able to fund your Apple or Google wallet with bitcoin would probably be a boon for mass user adoption.\n\nAnd, in countries with significant unbanked populations, it could provide a good solution to let companies working in payments to do what they do best and focus on routing transactions.\n\nBitcoin could even offer several advantages compared with other banking or payment service providers. For example, smart contracts could be set up to make that money usable only in certain places, or to be able to buy certain products – 'programmable money', as some people call it.\n\nOn the other hand, giving up on the user experience would limit the possible capabilities to those people most likely to use a digital wallet.\n\nFurthermore, while centralizing wallets in these big companies would make things easy for the regulators, they would definitely slow down adoption on some of the most attractive features of bitcoin: borderless and instant payments.\n\nLaying the groundwork\n\nYou must be thinking: why not do both? In fact, that is the current path we appear to be on today. Some people are working on bitcoin as a value routing system, while others are building wallets and other services on top of the network.\n\nYet there are some key architectural decisions that need to be made sooner or later if bitcoin is to scale, and being very clear on what we want to achieve would give the necessary visibility for others to know where to invest.\n\nIt’s an open-source project, I know, but don’t tell me that there isn’t a group of people who are more influential to the project than others.\n\nFocusing is key to any project/startup, and that shouldn’t be different for bitcoin. The guys who built TCP/IP were building TCP/IP. They didn't do it with next Monday's newspaper in hand thinking of WWW, VOIP, FTP, SMTP and so on.\n\nThat doesn’t mean not thinking ahead on scalability issues, but working on a solid protocol and letting others build upon it. The difference here is whether to develop the platform for the next Visa competitor, or to work on the foundations and let someone else make the credit card business obsolete by running their product on a state-of-the-art bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMaintaining focus\n\nI haven’t really made up my mind yet which is the best path we should follow as a community. There are lots of pros and cons to consider, but I do know that a lack of focus gives competitors the space they need to keep building a network effect and to catch up with the functionalities of bitcoin that your average Joe would find appealing.\n\nNot everyone is in bitcoin for political reasons, but for the efficiencies that the technology can bring to people in their financial transactions.\n\nIf someone else brings those efficiencies in first, it will be twice as hard to convince users to come over to bitcoin.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

If anything, law enforcement agencies have become more accustomed to working in this space, and are likely to develop even more ways to bust technologically savvy criminals.\n\nGOING UNDERCOVER\n\nJust like in analog investigations, going undercover on the dark web can be a highly effective tactic. For six months, investigators posed as a weapons seller. Naturally, anyone wanting to purchase guns had to provide a postal address, making it fairly trivial for the police to then link real identities to potential customers. In all, law enforcement busted over a dozen people. Similar operations have been carried out against those trying to buy poisons.\n\nUndercover agents have also penetrated wider dark web organisations. On the original Silk Road, authorities took over the account of a staff member. The imposter gained so much trust that they were quickly invited straight into the site\'s replacement, launched in late 2014. From the very start of the second Silk Road, investigators already had a man on the inside, able to contact directly with the marketplace\'s owners, and feed information to other agents. In Australia, Queensland Police\'s Task Force Argos assumed the role of a notorious child abuse site administrator for months, leading to the arrest of pedophiles all over the world.\n\nIn a way, law enforcement have taken advantage of the protections offered by Tor to blend in with everyone else—on the dark web, you never really know who is on the other end of a conversation.\n\nHACKING\n\nOne way to circumvent Tor is to attack the endpoint; that is, the computers of users themselves. That\'s what the FBI did on a massive dark web child pornography site called Playpen: the agency deployed malware, so that when a user clicked on a child pornography related forum their real IP address was sent to investigators, revealing their likely location. (The FBI seized Playpen after the administrator had misconfigured the site, exposing its IP address to the normal internet).\n\nHacking could quite possibly be the most effective way of identifying people on the dark web, at least judging by the number of computers unmasked. As part of the operation, the FBI harvested over 1000 US based IP addresses, and Europol generated 3,229 of its own cases. Those leads won\'t all necessarily lead to convictions, but over 135 people have been charged in the US so far, and new cases keep on rolling in. The FBI has used this mass-hacking approach several times, and could very well have hit innocent users of a privacy focused email service.\n\nAt least one foreign law enforcement agency has hacked dark web suspects too. In December 2014, the unnamed agency sent a child pornography site moderator a link to a video, which was configured to route their traffic outside of the Tor network.\n\nAnother hack didn\'t attack endpoints, but abused a vulnerability in Tor itself, allowing researchers from Carnegie Mellon University\'s Software Engineering Institute (SEI) to learn the IP addresses of dark web marketplaces as well as users. Even though this attack wasn\'t carried out by the FBI itself, the feds just subpoenaed SEI for the identifying information. SEI\'s research was carried out back in the first half of 2014, but likely related convictions are still coming through: a man recently pleaded guilty to running a dark web marketplace after the FBI fed UK police with a slew of IP addresses.\n\nIn general, armed with an IP cops just need to then subpoena the respective internet service provider or datacenter for the customer\'s details, get a warrant, and then raid their house.\n\nOPEN SOURCE INFORMATION\n\nEven if a criminal\'s business exists primarily on the dark web, they might have left digital breadcrumbs—in forum posts or public documents, for example—that lead investigators to the suspect\'s identity. Famously, a real breakthrough in the Silk Road case was down to some creative Googling by Gary Alford, a tax investigator. He found that Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the site, had advertised Silk Road on a popular bitcoin forum, and in another post included his personally identifiable email address.\n\nSomething similar happened with the man alleged to be Variety Jones, an enigmatic figure who pulled many of the strings behind Silk Road. Through online sleuthing of old cannabis enthusiast forums and business documentation, independent researcher La Moustache managed to name Variety Jones as Thomas Clark. Olford cited much of the same evidence in his criminal complaint against Clark, filed two months later.\n\nIn another case, suspected cannabis dealer David Ryan Burchard tried to trademark his dark web brand ""caliconnect"" in his own name. Naturally, this publicly available nugget of info helped investigators link Burchard to the caliconnect moniker.\n\nMASS SURVEILLANCE\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nThe UK has set up a dedicated unit for tackling dark web crime, which is taking advantage of the country\'s mass surveillance capabilities. The National Crime Agency (NCA) and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) ""Joint Operations Cell"" (JOC) was launched in November 2015, and is ""initially""focused on online child sexual exploitation. According to a government document from February, ""Bulk data has supported the disruption of over 50 child sexual exploitation offenders in the UK in the last 30 months alone."" Because evidence obtained by interception is not admissible in UK courts, people caught by this method are unlikely to ever have a chance to contest its legality.\n\nDIGGING THROUGH SEIZED DATA\n\nAn arrest of a vendor or the seizure of a marketplace can generate a mountain of new leads for investigators to follow. Prominent German vendor \'Shiny Flakes\' was busted last year with a staggering 320 kilos of drugs. Fortunately for investigators, Shiny Flakes had kept a tidy spreadsheet of all orders which is being used to track down buyers, according to local and state police.\n\nAnd buying drugs on the dark web can even come back to bite people years later. After arresting another vendor who stored details on his customers, German authorities recently fined someone over €3,000 for purchasing small quantities off the original Silk Road.\n\nFOLLOWING THE MONEY\n\nDark web marketplaces typically use the pseudo-anonymous currency bitcoin for all transactions, the idea being that transactions can be carried out with no link to the buyer or seller\'s real identity. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), part of the Department of Homeland Security, however, has set up a dedicated task force for tracking down those who launder their proceeds with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nHSI Special Agent Mathew Larsen started investigating David Burchard in part because of his sale of millions of dollars of bitcoins to an unlicensed currency exchange, according to a criminal complaint filed in March. It\'s not totally clear which exchange was monitored, or how the transaction was flagged in the first place; the case is still ongoing. But HSI is certainly paying attention to the sale of large chunks of bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain evidence was also used in the conviction of Shaun Bridges, a Secret Service who ripped off Silk Road staffers while simultaneously investigating the site. In a diagram included in the criminal complaint, prosecutors mapped out how thousands of bitcoins were funneled from Silk Road into a Mt. Gox account belonging to Bridges. Investigators were then able to follow wire transfers to a company created by the agent. Just like in tax evasion or similar investigations, transferring funds and assets sourced from the dark web can create a solid path for the cops to follow.\n\nTHE POSTAL SYSTEM\n\nFor all its technological sophistication, the dark web drug trade relies on postal systems or ordinary couriers. Dealers have to properly package their product and make sure its ""stealth"" is up to scratch, otherwise customs officials may seize the package. But the feds might also investigate who the package was being sent to, or where it was coming from.\n\nPost boxes or offices also provide a perfect surveillance opportunity for law enforcement. Authorities intercepted multiple packages of heroin from notorious Silk Road drug dealer Steven ""Nod"" Sadler in September 2012. Post office employees were then able to identify Jenna White, Sadler\'s girlfriend, as the person regularly depositing the parcels across the Seattle area. Her hand-writing was the same as that on the packages, and post office cameras picked up her license plate number.\n\nAlthough the drugs weren\'t sourced from the dark web, in 2013 the US Postal Service (USPS) opened a package that contained 500 grams of what would turn out to be synthetic stimulant methylone. Investigators would eventually make a controlled delivery, and arrest their suspect.\n\nCriminals have always tried to be one step ahead, and technology often revolutionizes how illegal goods are traded or sourced. But when drugs, guns and pedophilia moved onto the dark web, the cops came too.']"

The terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nWhile Kraken is acquiring the assets and customer base of CleverCoin, the team behind the exchange isn\'t carrying over to the new owners.\n\nWhen reached for comment, CleverCoin CEO Karsten Nilsen said that he and co-founder Christian de Kok wouldn\'t be joining Kraken as part of the deal, and will move on to another business focused on enterprise IT.\n\nFounded in early 2014, CleverCoin spent that year expanding its services to move past its initial market in The Netherlands, looking to capture greater market share in Europe.\n\nKraken CEO Jesse Powell said that the deal was buoyed by what he described as a brightening outlook for digital currencies, pointing to recent price increases and clarification on regulatory questions as key drivers.\n\nHe said in a statement:\n\n""The acquisition of CleverCoin will empower Kraken with greater liquidity and a significantly expanded customer base in Europe, our flagship market.""\n\nBlog posts on CleverCoin’s website suggest that the acquisition was motivated, at least in part, by past issues with a payment processor they were using.\n\nOn 15th April, the exchange announced that it had stopped processing orders, and later that month it was still working on the problem. Earlier this month, the company said that it had “found a solution” and would make further details known on 28th June – the date of today’s announcement.\n\nNilsen referenced the processor issues in an email to CoinDesk, while also highlighting the existing relationship between the two exchanges.\n\n""We have known the Kraken team since being at [startup accelerator] Boost VC, lately we lost one of the biggest payment providers we were working with and we started talking and managed to come up with a great deal together,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Kraken.\n\nAcquisition image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, the gap between the two moving averages is narrowing and an upward crossover seems imminent, possibly indicating that buyers are regaining control. Bitcoin price is finding resistance at the 200 SMA, which usually holds as a dynamic inflection point.\n\nRSI is already indicating overbought conditions and is starting to turn lower, indicating that bearish pressure might return. Stochastic is still on the move up but is also near the overbought area, which means that buyers are getting exhausted and may let sellers take over.\n\nIf so, a break below the triangle support around $620 could take place and force bitcoin price to fall. The next potential support is located at the $580 level, at which several orders might be located.\n\nMarket Events\n\nNow that the main market event (EU referendum) has passed, traders are starting to book profits off their earlier bitcoin positions. In addition, market watchers are waiting for the next big catalyst before adding to their trades. So far, there is still a lot of uncertainty in the markets as UK officials and EU leaders haven’t started negotiations.\n\nRisk aversion is still present and this might be good for bitcoin price, especially since central bankers might be considering additional stimulus or intervening in the currency markets.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', '', ""The second-ever Bitcoin block reward halving is estimated to take place in a little under two weeks, and the overall effects of this event are still somewhat of an unknown. There has been a runup in the Bitcoin price over the past month, and many claim this is due to the upcoming halving, where the number of new bitcoins created roughly every 10 minutes is cut in half (from 25 to 12.5).\n\nTo get some informed opinions about what could happen next, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov and BTCC COO Samson Mow. BitFury manufactures ASIC Bitcoin mining chips (and mines with them), and BTCC controls one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools (in addition to other Bitcoin-related services).\n\nA Slight Drop in the Network Hashrate\n\nAlthough Vavilov and Mow were contacted separately, they had similar views on the upcoming Bitcoin halving. One of the most common, possibly-negative effects of the halving discussed in the past has been the idea that the network hashrate will decline as a result of the lower number of bitcoins released to miners on a regular schedule.\n\nIn terms of this possible issue, Vavilov stated:\n\n“Some decline in the Bitcoin network hashrate is expected, and we believe it will be insignificant. The most important thing is that even if the hashrate declines, it will not compromise the security of the Bitcoin network. As to the Bitcoin price, it surged close to 20 percent over the weekend spanning June 11th and June 12th, and it is a very robust appreciation. This is an indication that the halving event is regarded as a good thing for the Bitcoin industry and it is positively impacting the market even before it takes place.”\n\nMow shared similar comments:\n\n“It's likely we'll see the overall network hashrate drop slightly after the halving as some smaller miners find it less profitable to continue mining. However the longer-term effects will probably be negligible. Many smaller miners outside of China are mining on the PPLNS model so they are really mining on luck and are not as price sensitive. Within China, nearly all miners are on the PPS model, so their costs and revenues are very stable and predictable. That allows miners in China to optimize their operations for the halving and reduce any potential risk.”\n\nMow also agreed that the halving could continue to have a positive impact on the Bitcoin price. He noted, “The halving will work to drive up the price, and I believe the upward price movements we've seen lately are the first wave of the upcoming halving-related price increase. Post-halving, we'll see the upward trend continue as fewer coins are being supplied to the market and the halving risk is shown to be a non-issue.”\n\nAlthough Vavilov and Mow acknowledge the network hashrate may decline slightly, they do not think it will have an overly negative impact on the network.\n\nThe Halving Spurs Innovation\n\nIn the case of Vavilov, the BitFury CEO took his views a step further and said the halving has a positive effect on Bitcoin. He believes the upcoming halving will motivate various Bitcoin companies to innovate.\n\n“There are many reasons for optimism right now: We see a steady increase of adoption of blockchain technology and [the] Bitcoin Blockchain, in particular,” Vavilov said. “A very positive trend in this regard is a clear scalability roadmap, and Bitcoin protocol improvement efforts that include the segregated witness proposal, Lightning Network, sidechains, and so on. Thanks to the joint efforts by the Bitcoin community, all these technologies are being brought to life, so [the] Bitcoin Blockchain is fully ready to accommodate more users, more transactions and more business. We at The Bitfury Group, in turn, are fully ready for the reward halving.”\n\nVavilov added, “Those who cannot adapt fast enough will have to switch off. The Bitfury Group is fully prepared for the reward halving.”\n\nWhat About the Disaster Scenario?\n\nBoth Mow and Vavilov do not believe the halving will lead to some sort of disaster scenario such as the one described by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in a Medium post earlier this year. In direct response to some of the concerns laid out by Armstrong in that post, Mow said, “Hashrate won’t fall by 50 percent. It’s not possible. Anyone that suggests that hashrate will drop 50 percent is either fearmongering or doesn’t understand mining at all.”\n\nMow added that Armstrong’s premise is based on the, in his view, false assumption that the Bitcoin price will not increase as a result of the halving.\n\nMow went on to explain that a lot of new mining hardware has been activated on the Bitcoin network in recent months. “There is the concept of ‘sunk cost,’ which might not be factored in by some people when they write down their musings about the halving,” Mow noted. “Most people involved with mining know that a lot of new hashrate was added in the past several months. That's a lot of newer and more efficient hardware that came online which will have a much longer shelf-life. Current estimates are that 60-to-70 percent of the network is composed of newer 16nm ASIC chips.”\n\nTo his point, Bitcoin’s network hashrate has tripled from around 500 PH to roughly 1,500 PH since December of last year.\n\n“It would be naive to think that miners who pushed us from [500] PH to 1,500 PH didn’t have projections to recoup costs past halving and decided to invest anyway,” Mow added.\n\n“An increase in network hashrate tells us there’s more hardware, but more hardware also means more infrastructure like data centers, transformers, cooling systems and so on,” he said. “That’s expensive. The bulk of that sunk cost has already been incurred so that it can be recouped as much as possible at pre-halving price conditions. Having made those investments in new hardware and facilities, it’s unlikely that those miners will just power off.”\n\nMow said that many Bitcoin miners are bullish on the price and in it for the long haul, which means they are less concerned with what happens with the price in the short term.\n\nIn Mow’s view, there’s also nothing inherently wrong with full blocks on the Bitcoin network, which is a crucial aspect of the possible doomsday scenario related to the halving.\n\nHe stated:\n\n“The biggest fallacy in [Armstrong’s Medium post] is the part about full blocks. It does not matter if blocks are 70 percent full or if we are at 140 percent of capacity. Bitcoin is designed to function with full blocks – that is why Bitcoin has fees for transactions. Well-developed wallet software can estimate fees correctly, and in the event there is a backlog of transactions (which Bitcoin was also designed to handle), users simply pay a few cents more to prioritize their transactions if they’re in a hurry.”\n\nMow said that companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem could prop up the network if things started to take a turn for the worse. He mentioned increasing transaction fees, purchasing mining hardware and renting currently available hashing power as three potential options.\n\nThe Halving Is Not a Surprise\n\nThis change in monetary policy is not coming out of nowhere, Mow said. The schedule for the creation of new bitcoins has been known since the first blocks were mined in early 2009.\n\n“Miners have been planning and preparing for the halving for some time now,” he said.\n\nThe BTCC COO noted that many miners have been optimizing their costs due to the known, expected drop in the Bitcoin-denominated value of the block reward. Due to the recent spike in the Bitcoin price, the U.S. dollar-denominated value of the block reward could be higher than it was around this time last year. As Mow mentioned, the ASIC chips used by most miners these days are also more efficient than the ones used last year.\n\nThe halving is expected to take place on July 9. According to WinkDex, the Bitcoin price was $269.21 on that day last year, which means each block reward was worth $6,730.25. The Bitcoin price was roughly $635 at the time of this writing. If that price level were to hold, each block would be worth $7,937.50 after the halving.\n\n“With the prices as they are now, I wouldn't be too concerned about the miners,” Mow said.""]"

(Where the fault is due to a bug in the underlying EVM -- and not any specific smart contract that runs on it -- the development team will of course write and publish bug fixes.)”\n\nIt further adds a new kill switch whereby a yet to be determined number of Counterparty holders can “initiate a rapid shutdown of the EVM subsystem while the rest of the Counterparty network continues to function perfectly.”\n\nMade possible due to Counterparty’s core features of “asset creation, transfer and decentralized trading” being “completely independent of any smart contract functionality.”\n\nUtilizing Bitcoin’s Blockchain\n\nCounterparty was created by burning 2,125.63 Bitcoins, worth around $1.8 million at the time, in January 2014. It offers the ability to create assets by utilising Bitcoin’s Blockchain through embedding data in on-chain bitcoin transactions.\n\nIt now aims to provide much more complex and Turing complete functionality by incorporating Ethereum’s Virtual Machine, bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin.\n\nThe new smart contract functionality faces much competition, including within bitcoin. Rootstock, which is yet to be launched, provides the same functionality, but unlike Counterparty, it uses a sidechain, a very new technology with its own security parameters and trade-offs.\n\nIn turn, by using Bitcoin’s Blockchain, Counterparty is affected by protocol level Bitcoin qualities, such as roughly a 10-minute wait time for one confirmation, and, more recently, transaction backlogs during high usage leading to higher fees and, for some, lengthy waiting times.\n\nAn option to fully shut down all smart contracts\n\nAgainst Ethereum, Counterparty’s main benefit may be the “no-rollback” clause which binds developers to not offer Counterparty holders the option to provide a human fail-safe mechanism in the event of potentially catastrophic losses caused by a bug in a smart contract.\n\nHowever, that is balanced by Counterparty giving holders the option to fully shut down the entire EVM system and all smart contracts. A potentially drastic option with wide ramifications for Counterparty smart contract users and developers.\n\nNonetheless, Counterparty’s EVM gives the digital currency ecosystem more choice, with smart contract developers and users able to decide whether they wish to use Ethereum’s EVM which gives Ethereum’s ecosystem the ability to take action in the event of catastrophic losses that threaten the entire network, Counterparty’s EVM which benefits from the security of bitcoin’s blockchain and gives holders the option of shutting down the whole EVM system or, the eventually to be launched, Rootstock which uses sidechains.\n\nThe above are joined by many other forks of Ethereum, creating a vibrant smart contracts ecosystem and a mini-race of its own as parties vie to position themselves for mainstream adoption, especially now that Blockchain tech has been fully acknowledged with everyone, from giant banks to giant tech companies and start-ups racing to bring this new technology to the masses.', 'The price of the digital currency bitcoin rose 6.5% in the 24 hours directly after Britain voted to leave the European Union. And while the coin had already been on a ride over the two weeks before the vote (it\'s up 25% in the last month), for a number of factors besides the Brexit, it is likely that uncertainty over the situation stoked interest in the cryptocurrency, which is seen as an investment asset uncorrelated to the broader economy.\n\n\n\nBitcoin price over the past month from Winkdex, including Coinbase data. Note the spike after the Brexit vote, but also the much larger spike well before the vote. More\n\nNew data from Coinbase, which offers the leading bitcoin wallet and a popular bitcoin exchange, proves that the prospect of Brexit had an impact on bitcoin even before the referendum vote.\n\nIn the week leading up to the vote (June 13-20), Coinbase saw a 55% increase in new account sign-ups from Great Britain, and a 350% increase in bitcoin purchases from UK customers.\n\nOn the day of the Brexit vote, Coinbase saw an 86% increase in Great Britain signups.\n\n\n\nIt\'s one of the largest spikes in activity Coinbase has ever seen from one region in one week.\n\nThe British bitcoin bump is a reminder, a Coinbase spokesperson says, that bitcoin ""has long been a hedge against turmoil in Greece, capital controls in China, and macro-economic issues."" Indeed, many compare the coin to gold as an investment vehicle. The current market cap of all bitcoins is $10.1 billion.\n\n\n\nCoinbase, founded in 2012, has 4 million users and is now operable in 32 countries. It launched in the UK just one year ago, giving Brits the ability to buy bitcoin using pounds, euros or dollars.

Burberry\n\nHarry Potter author JK Rowling unleashes fury at Brexit voters', 'The Netherlands has been one of the leading bitcoin economies in the world since the city of Arnhem became known as the first ‘bitcoin city’ over two years ago. The country’s central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), was among the first of the monetary authorities to investigate bitcoin and blockchains, and the bank’s head of research, Jakob de Haan, spoke at a blockchain conference called Reinvent Money in September last year.\n\nIn March, the central bank mentioned in their annual report that they are specifically studying their own prototype cryptocurrency, dubbed ‘DNBCoin,’ which received worldwide press. The report addressed how blockchain technology could improve their core business model, but it gave no other details about the project, outside of putting it in a section of their report marked ""aims for 2016.""\n\nIt appears that the details about DNBCoin have finally arrived. According to Ron Berndesen, the head of Market Infrastructures Policy Department at DNB, who gave a speech at the Dutch Blockchain Conference last Monday, explained there was always a plan for three tests of blockchain technology at DNB, each to align with one of the three primary tasks of the central bank.\n\n- Ron Berndesen, Head of Market Infrastructures Policy Department at DNB\n\nThe first test, loosely purposed to see if a cryptocurrency of some kind could help with becoming a smoother payment system, was completed in-house, long ago. “DNBcoin prototype 1 was basically replicating the early days of bitcoin (Jan – Feb 2009) using five laptops in a connected network and our home-made genesis block,” Berndesen explained in his speech, before adding that “the blockchain is a promising technology for financial market infrastructures.”\n\nThe second test, completed more recently, ran in a very different environment, although it still centered around a cryptocurrency. “The second DNBcoin prototype takes the other extreme of bitcoin by jumping to the year 2140,” he offered, “the year when the last fraction of the 21 million bitcoins will be issued.”\n\nThis test seemed to show the bank something more promising. “Blockchain technology might potentially add a new dimension to the interaction between the supervisor and the supervised institutions,” he said of the results in his speech. To offer an example, he added that “if they share a blockchain the supervisor can automatically see all verified transactions.”\n\nBerndesen made clear that the coins used in these tests, both of which they referred to as “DNBCoin,” were for testing purposes. “The DNBcoin is only developed for internal test purposes, it will not be put into circulation.” For their third test in the series, however, there won’t even be a coin at all. It seems that the bank is giving up on cryptocurrencies altogether, according to the speaker. “Increasingly central banks view blockchain as a potentially promising technology for financial market infrastructures, but much less so for virtual currencies,” he said, when introducing the plan for DNB’s third phase of testing.\n\n- Ron Berndesen, Head of Market Infrastructures Policy Department at DNB\n\nThe third test, he said in his speech, “is necessary to understand the potential implications of blockchain for the money supply and potential seigniorage consequences of virtual currencies.” However, the lack of testing a cryptocurrency for the third test speaks volumes about the direction that DNB is likely heading in the future.\n\nWhile still attempting to test blockchain technology for monetary policy, running such a test without using a cryptocurrency narrows it down to a very specific type of platform, one that records transactional data but has no unit of valuable currency to mine like all cryptocurrencies do.\n\nThe solution that they are investigating is being described as a \'permissioned blockchain\', just like one of the many commercially available, private, blockchain data services. Blythe Masters’ Digital Asset Holdings, Factom, and Chain are all such services that are able to begin installation today. There are even enterprise-grade solutions available, including one by professional service firm Deloitte.\n\n\n\nPrivate blockchain services like these must rely on a centralized user database and the age-old user permissions scheme to keep value inside it secure. Hackers and identity thieves have a far easier time cracking a password than they could attack a public blockchain like bitcoin’s, due to its’ open and permissionless nature. At best, according to Andreas Antonopoulos in his speech entitled “Bubble boy and the sewer rat,” such networks simply become bloated intranets, constantly in need of repair and patches for security’s sake.\n\nIf Antonopoulos is correct, then for a large corporation, it should already be considered risky to consider holding anything of value in such a blockchain environment. For a central bank, however, it is hard to see how even considering such risk can be justified at all.\n\nAt least DNB does not appear to be in a hurry. They have not given any indication of an official start of the testing for this new system, and “It will take a number of years before the full potential will become clear,” Berndesen said in his speech. He also mentioned that for his third test, he is focused on creating an environment with the four following properties:\n\nThe network is about ownership of a certain digital asset. There is some degree of trust among participants in the network. Resilience of the network is crucial. Adding intelligence to initiate or trigger transactions is important.\n\nWhile properties three and four are commendable, number one is vague, and number two is the source of the problem Antonopoulos described in his video. Trusting others when trust is not necessary is precisely what opens the door to hackers, typically in the form of identity theft.\n\nOther central banks have been talking about blockchains for one purpose or another already, but nothing as specific as what DNB is planning. The one exception is Canada’s recently-leaked CAD-coin project, however, their plan is for a cryptocurrency that is tied to their fiat Canadian dollars, or perhaps intended to serve as the online extension of them. Neither option would be likely to come with such problems in security as DNB could face.\n\nThe closest thing to a central bank deploying a permissioned blockchain network would be the international payment network SWIFT, which has been the target for a constant flow of hacks lately, ever since a successful cyber-heist of US$81 million in February this year. Swift’s CEO, Gottfried Leibbrandt stated that “we’ll be looking for a number of quick wins to improve things in the near term,” during an interview with Bloomberg. However, “the full rollout, and the full shore up, will be a matter of years,” he added.\n\nThis is likely why SWIFT is also looking at a permissioned, private blockchain system as a solution to their problems. If they were to implement one, they could be trading one security problem for another.', 'Tuesday, June 28, 2016\n\nIt has been over two years since the IRS came out with its initial position on the tax treatment of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, but there has yet to be any follow-up on questions that this initial position has raised. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has written a letter to the IRS urging the Service to publish additional guidance to provide more certainty on these open issues.\n\nIRS Notice 2014-21 stated that virtual currencies are to be treated as property, not as currency. This was potentially good news to Bitcoin investors, since it would allow them to pay the lower long-term capital gains tax rate on profits if they held the Bitcoin for over a year. On the other hand, this position was inconvenient for consumers and merchants who use and accept virtual currencies as a means of exchange, because each transaction, no matter how small, must be reported in order to determine the amount of gain or loss every time a consumer uses the virtual currency as a means of exchange, and every time the merchant converts the virtual currency received in a transaction into U.S. currency.\n\nIn the two years since the IRS published Notice 2014-21, this classification of virtual currencies as property rather than a currency, many other questions have been raised, but have not been addressed. The letter from the AICPA sets them out:\n\n(1) Determining Fair Market Value of the Virtual Currency: The IRS should publish guidance on whether a taxpayer can use any published exchange rate to determine the fair market value of virtual currencies, and whether the taxpayer must use the same published exchange rate for all other transactions. The letter notes that there are wide variance in the fair market value of Bitcoin on four Bitcoin published rates (Google, Bitcoin exchange rate, Bitstamp, CEX and Winkdex), citing an example selected at the same time, reflecting a range of value from a low of $227.84 to a high of $231.14.\n\n(2) Expenses of Obtaining Virtual Currencies: Are the expenses to mine virtual currencies currently deductible, or are they to be added to the basis of the mined currency? This would normally be an easy call – costs would normally be added to the basis of the property that is manufactured – but the 2014 guidance intimates that this might not be the case.\n\n(3) Tracking Basis of Virtual Currency: Because virtual currencies are treated as property, the taxpayer must track the cost of purchasing each unit acquired, in order to determine the taxable gain when it is sold (including every time a consumer uses it to purchase goods and services). The AICPA letter says that tracking the basis for virtual currency is virtually impossible when it is used in everyday commerce, and asked for the IRS to consider alternative means to determine basis.\n\n(4) General Transaction Rules Applicable to Property: The AICPA letter asks whether the general tax rules applicable to property (rather than currencies) would apply to virtual currencies. For example, the letter asks whether a taxpayer would be able to take advantage of the tax free like-kind exchange rules of section 1031 if one type of virtual currency is exchanged for a different type of virtual currency (for example, a Bitcoin for Ethereum exchange).\n\n(5) Character of Virtual Currencies Held By Merchants: How should virtual currencies that are accepted by a merchant be classified for tax purposes – as a capital asset or as an ordinary income asset?\n\n(6) Charitable Contributions: Does a contribution of virtual currencies to a charitable organization require a formal appraisal? The general rule is that if a taxpayer donates property worth more than $5,000 to a charitable organization, the taxpayer must obtain a formal appraisal to support the amount to be deducted as a charitable contribution. There is an exception, where an appraisal is not needed for the donation of securities that are traded on a published exchange. The letter asks whether the donation of virtual currency should be subject to the same exception, since they are traded on published exchanges.\n\n(7) Is Virtual Currency a Commodity: If virtual currencies are treated as a commodity, would it be subject to the mark-to-market rules for commodity traders?\n\n(8) How About a De Minimus Exception For Small Transactions: The letter asks the IRS for an exception to the rule requiring a taxpayer to report each virtual currency transaction as a taxable sale of property when used to make small consumer purchases.\n\n(9) Retirement Accounts: Can virtual currencies be held as an investment in a qualified retirement plan (like a 401(k) plan)? The rules for eligible investments in such plans limit the types of property than can be held in a qualified retirement plan.\n\n(10) Foreign Reporting Requirements: Are virtual currencies subject to Foreign Bank Account Reports (FBAR) and/or Foreign Bank Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) reporting?\n\nAs these issues get worked out, others are likely to arise. Until they are addressed by the IRS, the uncertainty will likely inhibit the growth of virtual currencies in the U.S. economy.\n\nTo see a copy of the AICPA letter to the IRS, please click here.', ""Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain and know your customer (KYC) policy or anti-money laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin and for what.\n\nThis is not ideal from a privacy perspective. To show some examples; Bitcoin users might not want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.\n\nAdditionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.\n\nOne solution to increase privacy and protect fungibility is to exchange bitcoins for fiat currency without being required to identify yourself.\n\nThe Problem\n\nExchanges, brokerages, money transmitters and other service providers that serve as the “on-ramps” and “off-ramps” between bitcoin and fiat currency, form an important part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. But from a privacy and fungibility perspective, a heavy reliance on these companies is not ideal: Practically all fiat-facing bitcoin-companies are required to apply AML/KYC-checks on their customers.\n\nMoreover, these checks can be (and are sometimes) combined with wider blockchain-analysis, pertaining to the past trail of bitcoins, to in some cases even monitor where bitcoins move to after leaving these services. This allows for extensive mapping of the Bitcoin ecosystem. (In a recent blog post, R3CEV Director of Market Research Tim Swanson even described this as a “de facto Kimberley Process”.) There are some ways to avoid these kinds of checks. Most obviously, users can exchange bitcoins for fiat outside of any exchange, for example, at Bitcoin meetups. But it becomes a bit more tricky online: Users need to trust their counterparty or maybe a dedicated middleman to actually send the bitcoins or wire the fiat currency. Alternatively, converting bitcoins to fiat currency can be done by purchasing Bitcoin debit cards such as Cryptopay or BitPlastic. Converting fiat currency to bitcoins, vouchers such as the Bitupcard may also offer a solution.\n\nMost of these options, however, are rather expensive, clunky or both.\n\nLocal Exchange\n\nA perhaps more sophisticated solution is the use of exchanges that don't require identity-checks; there are several.\n\nThe earliest of such alternatives is the Finland-based exchange LocalBitcoins, launched in 2012. As opposed to typical exchanges, LocalBitcoins is a platform that does not touch fiat currency itself. Instead, users send the fiat through typical wire transfers or other methods. And, as the name of the website suggests, users can also meet up locally and trade bitcoins for cash on the spot. This allows LocalBitcoins to be more lenient when it comes to AML/KYC-policies – although some sellers do require their counterparty to identify themselves through the LocalBitcoins-platform to some degree. (In the United States, some LocalBitcoins.com sellers have been charged under anti-money laundering laws.)\n\nBuilding on this concept in 2014, the Mycelium mobile Bitcoin wallet introduced Local Trader: a Bitcoin exchange built right into the wallet. Mycelium users who want to buy or sell bitcoins for cash can make an offer on the Mycelium platform where they indicate a price and maximum distance they’re willing to travel. Once a match is made with another trader, they can meet up and complete the trade locally, typically with cash. The Bitcoin side of the trade is taken care of in-app, which also includes a reputation system.\n\nDecentralized Exchange\n\nHowever, even if the fiat side of the trade is handled locally, LocalBitcoins and Mycelium types of solutions still rely on a central intermediary to some extent: LocalBitcoins and Mycelium. And in the end, these companies can be required to apply AML/KYC-types of regulation as well - or be shut down entirely. (LocalBitcoins had to cease its operations in Germany back in 2014.) An interesting alternative, therefore, is fully decentralized exchanges that rely on no central intermediary to process fiat or Bitcoin transactions.\n\nA first attempt at establishing a decentralized exchange was Coinffeine, launched in late 2013. Coinfeinne partly solved the counterparty risk – the risk of a trading partner not paying up – through a combination of security deposits and an incremental trading protocol. In short, both parties in a trade, deposit a specific amount of bitcoins into a two-of-two multi-address, requiring a signature from each to unlock. Subsequently, the trading partners trade in incremental amounts: no single trade is bigger than the security deposit. As such, neither trader has an incentive not to pay their part: they would lose their security deposit worth the same amount if they did.\n\nCoinfeinne is a novel idea, but it doesn't hold up as nicely in practice. The security deposits leave room for certain types of fraud or extortion. A victim might, for instance, prefer to get half of his deposit back rather than nothing at all. Additionally, trading in incremental amounts is not exactly user-friendly nor fast, especially if it takes a wire transfer to complete each time.\n\nMore recently, the decentralized Bitcoin exchange Bitsquare launched. Bitsquare solved the counterparty problem with dedicated arbiters, as well as – again – security deposits. These deposits are locked up along with the traded bitcoins in a two-of-three multisig address where the third key is held by a dedicated and mutually agreed upon arbiter. As such, the buyer is incentivized to send the fiat currency; he'll lose his deposit otherwise. And once he receives the fiat curremcy, the seller is incentivized to release the bitcoins for the same reason. If either attempts to cheat, the arbitrator helps the victim get his bitcoins.\n\nTo prevent bank-chargeback fraud, Bitsquare limits trades to a maximum between .75 and 1.5 each, for now."", '“Bitcoin bank” Circle is betting big on China. The company has announced that it raised $60 million in a new Series D funding round led by Beijing-based investment firm IDG Capital, an existing Circle investor. The company also announced the opening of its Chinese subsidiary Circle China, which had been separately funded earlier.\n\nParticipants in the new Circle funding round include global venture capital and private equity firm, Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners and a group of Chinese firms including; Baidu, China International Capital Corporation ALPHA, China Everbright Limited, Wanxiang and CreditEase. Individual investors include Sam Palmisano, former CEO and chairman of IBM, and Glenn Hutchins, co-founder of private equity firm Silver Lake.\n\nCircle now has a solid network of partners in the region, notably including technology giant Baidu.\n\n“Circle is one of the most impressive startups in the blockchain technology space,” said Peter Fang, executive director of Baidu corporate development. “Together with other influential investors, Baidu is very excited to partner with Circle team to build its vision successfully and globally.""\n\nCircle co-founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire noted that the company is building a global payments network that will soon enable users in the U.S., Europe and China to exchange value seamlessly and nearly instantly.\n\n“Today we announced two related milestones: a $60 million strategic financing from a syndicate of major Chinese strategic investors; and the formation of Circle China, a new Beijing-based company focused on bringing the benefit of open, global, blockchain-powered social payments to Chinese consumers,” said Neville and Allaire. “We want to connect consumers using dollars, pounds, euro and renminbi the same way that the web, email and other protocols have connected consumers globally.”\n\nCircle China was formed six months ago as an independent Chinese company focused on bringing the benefits of open, global social payments to Chinese consumers, with a multi-million-dollar seed investment from many of the strategic investors in the new Series D round. Circle emphasizes its commitment to developing a China-native company with major Chinese owners and investors in both Circle China and Circle Global and being fully compliant with the laws and regulations of the Chinese payments and banking regime.\n\n""We\'re not aiming to compete with the domestic market as that would be a suicide mission given the strength of local players like Alipay and WeChat but we can connect Chinese consumers with the euro zone and dollar markets,"" Allaire told Reuters, adding that Circle China has not yet launched a product, pending a deal with a local banking partner and a legal license to operate.\n\n“IDG is very bold on Circle’s vision of blockchain and social payment,” said Hugo Shong, founding general partner of IDG Capital. “Just like the success of Alipay and WeChat pay here in China, we have full confidence in Circle team building global products which will be enjoyed by hundreds of millions of people daily.”\n\nAccording to Circle’s founders, Chinese consumers will play a much bigger role in the global economy in the coming years. Therefore the renminbi will become a much more important currency in the world. Neville and Allaire mentioned remittances sent home by Chinese students and young professionals abroad as an important application of Circle’s services.\n\nIn April, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Circle was granted an e-money license by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and started offering British Circle users the ability to hold GBP and make GBP payments instantly with zero fees. Now the company is announcing that it is opening Circle Euro support to consumers in Spain as the first part of a broader European-wide rollout to occur over the coming month, once some remaining regulatory obstacles have been cleared.\n\n“‘Lighting up Euro’ on Circle’s platform is critical in our effort to enable consumers everywhere to share value and is also important to our efforts in China,” noted Neville and Allaire, adding that the company is on track to exceed a billion dollars in transaction volume on an annual basis and the global customer base has grown by 300 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nForbes notes that Circle currently uses the Bitcoin blockchain, as opposed to alternative or private blockchains, to settle payments. In fact, in November Allaire wrote a thoughtful analysis of the blockchain vs. bitcoin issue and explained the advantages of the Bitcoin blockchain over alternative implementations. However, Allaire noted that Circle is open to using any public blockchain as long as it has good software support, distribution among merchants and consumers, a global liquid market and enough scale to be secure, as reported by Forbes.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Imagine that you are a master thief, a real Danny Ocean. In your latest caper, you discover a way into the vault of a brand-new bank, one thought to be pretty much uncrackable. And then, using the bank\'s own state-of-the-art systems against it, you steal about $60 million dollars. Finally, you escape — and no one knows who you are.\n\n\n\nBut there\'s a problem: The money you stole has to sit in escrow for a month. So you can\'t celebrate with a dinner at the French Laundry. Also, by the time you leave the vault, everyone knows that you stole the money and that it\'s in escrow — so they have 27 days to figure out a way to keep you from getting it, laundering it, and spending it.\n\nThis is basically what happened earlier this month when a hacker or hackers siphoned about a third of the money out of a state-of-the-art online investment fund called the DAO. Investors buy into the DAO — short for decentralized autonomous organization — with a year-old cryptocurrency called ether. At the time of the hack, the DAO had raised over $150 million worth of the stuff, which amounts to 15% of all ether in existence. Over the course of several hours on June 16 and 17, the hacker stole about 3.7 million Ethereum tokens from the fund. That\'s a large enough chunk of the total amount of ether to cause panic, and the price of the currency fell more than a quarter. Even after that crash, as of this writing, the purloined ether are still worth about $50 million.\n\nThe tricky part is, there is no way to directly withdraw from the DAO. Instead, to cash out, you have to create a so-called child DAO, a kind of escrow from which no ether can be extracted for 27 days. That gives the major stakeholders in the DAO and Ethereum a month to figure out a way to stop the hacker from ever getting their money.\n\n""There’s been a lot of coordinated activity,"" said Joseph Lubin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum and the founder of ConsenSys, a blockchain technology company. He told BuzzFeed News that Ethereum developers, currency exchangers, and miners are working together to make sure the money never gets spent. ""It\'s not going to happen,"" he said.\n\nYou Have to Outsmart the Bank a Second Time\n\nIn the Danny Ocean case, law enforcement\'s first step would be to freeze the assets in escrow, to prevent them from ever reaching the thief. But in the technolibertarian world of cryptocurrency, things aren\'t quite so easy. Who is law enforcement? And what are the laws? The idea behind the DAO, like the idea behind bitcoin and ether, was to create a code-based financial entity with no cops and no centralized control — meaning there\'s no Fed to step in during a crisis.\n\nEthereum, which has attracted attention from JPMorgan Chase, IBM, and Samsung, differentiates itself from bitcoin because it\'s more than just a cryptocurrency; instead, it is a platform for different distributed applications, of which ether (currency) and the DAO (funding) are only two. Just last month, Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of the leading bitcoin wallet Coinbase, wrote that ""Ethereum is ahead of Bitcoin in many ways and represents the bleeding edge of digital currency.""\n\n\n\nIt\'s unclear to what extent American securities laws apply to Ethereum, or to the theft. So far the SEC has expressed ""concern,"" and little else, over the hack. Also, major changes to the DAO are supposed to happen by consensus, per its distributed nature, or not at all. So the theft, or rather the response to the theft, poses major questions for Ethereum and for cryptocurrency in general. Namely: Is it a theft at all, or a natural consequence of the philosophy behind the currency? And if the hack forces Ethereum\'s applications to become more secure, is it an improvement?\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin, the 22-year-old Canadian programmer who invented Ethereum, was quick to propose freezing the hacker\'s ill-gotten money. Known as a ""soft fork,"" the asset freeze involves updating the Ethereum code in a way that prevents money from moving into or out of the hacker\'s unique address.\n\n\n\nSounds simple, right?\n\nIt is, sort of. The soft fork is just a basic software update. Because of the way Ethereum works, though, 51% of the cryptocurrency\'s nodes (basically, users) would have to update their software for the freeze to take effect. And that gives the hacker some room to come up with a bold plan.\n\n\n\nOn June 18, someone claiming to represent the hacker wrote in a DAO slack channel, “[S]oon we will have a smart contract to reward miners who oppose the soft fork ... 1 million ether + 100 btc will be shared with miners.” In other words, the hacker plans on bribing Ethereum miners with nearly a third of the stolen money if they reject the software update.\n\nLubin told BuzzFeed News that 85% of Ethereum miners have already agreed to accept the soft fork, and that the legitimate businesses that deal in Ethereum have too great a stake in its success to cooperate with the hacker.\n\n""No one is going to attempt to take bribes from stolen money,"" Lubin said. ""The implications are nightmarish, socially and legally,"" he said.\n\nCongrats, You Finally Got Your Money — Now You Need to Launder It\n\nBut let\'s say the nightmare comes true: lots of Ethereum miners take the bribe and in a few weeks the attacker withdraws the ether from escrow. What then? Well, then they would need to launder their score, which would in this hypothetical be whittled down to 2.7 million ether, or $37 million. However, they couldn\'t exchange it all at once for dollars.\n\nFirst of all, the currency can\'t be easily exchanged without affecting its price. ""As soon as you start withdrawing, the value will drop precipitously,"" Robert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nAnd second, many of the exchanges where the hacker could trade the ether for dollars (or more likely, bitcoin) require identification, so even if they did do business with the thief, it would unmask them.\n\nA more feasible option, according to Philip Daian, a software engineer who researches Ethereum, would be to use an exchange that doesn\'t require ID, like ShapeShift, or to take the money to a Dark Web exchange and try to sell it at a discount or for more liquid goods — like, say, drugs or weapons.\n\n""He might be able to get a million dollars out if he tried really hard,"" said Graham.\n\n\n\nToday, that seems implausible. The soft fork patch has been released, and it looks likely to pass. While that would mean our master thief never gets to spend their ether, it doesn\'t necessarily mean they haven\'t already enjoyed a windfall. The Ethereum community has widely speculated that the hacker or hackers placed a short bet on the currency prior to carrying out the attack. As the value of Ethereum plunged, such a bet would have paid off handsomely. In that case, any ether the attacker is able to get from the hack itself would be a bonus.\n\n(Regardless of whether the attacker makes any money, he or she appears to have destroyed the DAO. In a likely next step after the soft fork, a so-called hard fork would freeze the DAO and let all of its investors withdraw their initial investments. There are a number of reasons why this hard fork would happen, including loss of confidence in the DAO code by investors and the public relations damage to the Ethereum platform beyond the DAO if the hacker is allowed to keep the money.)\n\nAs a Hail Mary, Why Not Sue the Bank You Robbed?\n\nBut the hacker hasn\'t exhausted all their options yet: They could always sue the bank. In an open letter published to Pastebin, someone claiming the be attacker wrote, ""A soft or hard fork would amount to seizure of my legitimate and rightful ether, claimed legally through the terms of a smart contract. ... I reserve all rights to take any and all legal action against any accomplices of illegitimate theft, freezing, or seizure of my legitimate ether, and am actively working with my law firm."" In the world of cryptocurrency, where code is the ultimate authority, funds gained by technical means — which is exactly how the thief pulled off the heist — are legitimate.\n\nThis is not an unpopular view. ""The whole reason for cryptocurrency is to get out of the idea of the big guys manipulating the system for their own benefit,"" Graham told BuzzFeed News. ""I hope that he wins, philosophically."" Graham is right — an intervention in the DAO would favor the interests of people who have lot of ether.\n\nIn other words, imagine our master thief suing the bank they stole money from for trying to get it back. And then, imagine the other customers applauding them for teaching the bank a lesson.\n\nAll of this means the very bureaucratic bodies that crypto-purists detest are probably going to get involved. Said Lubin, the Ethereum co-founder, ""It\'s almost certain entities like the FBI and the SEC are going to investigate this matter.""\n\nSo now imagine your single heist calling into question the very principles of the currency you\'ve stolen. Even Danny Ocean never did that.']"
06/29/2016,"['(Reuters) – Investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss on Wednesday filed to switch the listing of their proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund to BATS Global Markets from Nasdaq, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Winklevoss brothers, identical twins, had filed their first application for a listing three years ago.\n\nThe proposed ETF, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, will list 1 million shares at $65 each, according to the filing. That is up from a list price of $20.09 per share given in the first filing.\n\nThe filing did not say why there was a change in trading venues, but over the last year BATS has emerged as one of the fastest-rising trading venues for ETFs. BATS is the second largest U.S. equities market operator.\n\nIf approved by the SEC, the Winklevoss ETF would be the first bitcoin ETF issued by a U.S. entity.\n\nThe ETF would trade under the ticker symbol COIN.\n\nGemini Trust Company, the Winklevoss brothers’ trust company, which runs a bitcoin trading venue, has been designated the custodian of the ETF. There was no designated custodian in the previous filings.\n\nGemini operates a trading platform for bitcoin and for another digital currency, ether.\n\nFor more about Bitcoin, watch:\n\nThe ETF’s bitcoin will be valued using the Gemini’s spot price as of 4 p.m. Eastern time each business day, according to the SEC filing.\n\nBitcoin’s value has been highly volatile, having peaked at over $1,200 in late 2013 before crashing after the collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange.\n\nIt has since recovered, hitting a more than two-year high of nearly $780 last week in the run-up to the British referendum whether the country should leave the European Union. As of late Wednesday, one bitcoin was worth $634.24 on the Bitstamp platform.', 'Network Bottleneck\n\nThe American companies whose executives journeyed to the Grand Hyatt — including venture-capital-funded start-ups like Coinbase and Circle — are fighting to make Bitcoin bigger. They hope to expand the capacity of the Bitcoin network so that it can process more transactions and compete with the PayPals and Visas of the world.\n\nThe current size of the network goes back to the early days, when Bitcoin’s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, limited the amount of data that could travel through the network, essentially capping it at about seven transactions a second. As Bitcoin has grown more popular, those limits have caused severe congestion and led to lengthy transaction delays.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe American delegation in China had a software proposal, known as Bitcoin Classic, that would change all that.\n\nThe Chinese companies, though, had the ultimate decision-making power over any changes in the software, and they did not agree with the American delegation. The Chinese had thrown in their lot with another group of longtime programmers who wanted to keep Bitcoin smaller, in part to keep it more secure. The Americans hoped to persuade the Chinese to switch sides.\n\nIn a hotel conference room, the American team of about a half-dozen people cycled through its PowerPoint slides, in English and Chinese, arguing for expansion of the network, most notably pointing to the long delays that have been plaguing the system as a result of the congestion. The Chinese representatives listened and conferred among themselves. The group took a break for a lunch of lamb and dumplings at a nearby mall.\n\nPhoto\n\n“We kept coming back and saying, ‘For better or worse, you have this leadership in the industry, and everyone is looking to you to show some leadership,’” said Brian Armstrong, chief executive of Coinbase.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Armstrong said, “We were unable to convince them.”\n\nSome Bitcoin advocates have complained that the Chinese companies have been motivated only by short-term profit, rather than the long-term success and ideals of the project. Bobby Lee, chief executive of the Bitcoin company BTCC, which is based in Shanghai, bristled at that — and at the notion that the Chinese companies represent any sort of united front. He attended the April meeting and pointed out that the Chinese companies had disagreed among themselves on how urgent it was to make changes to the Bitcoin software.\n\nHe said the American companies failed to understand the power dynamics in the room that day. “It was almost like imperialistic Westerners coming to China and telling us what to do,” Mr. Lee said in an interview last week. “There has been a history on this. The Chinese people have long memories.”\n\nA Mining Powerhouse\n\nThe mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, released the software in early 2009. It was designed to provide both a digital coin and a new way to move and hold money, much as email had made it possible to send messages without using a postal service.\n\nFrom the beginning, the system was designed to be decentralized — operated by all the people who joined their computers to the Bitcoin network and helped process the transactions, much as Wikipedia entries are written and maintained by volunteers around the world.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe appeal of a group-run network was that there would be no single point of failure and no company that could shut things down if the police intervened. This was censorship-free money, Bitcoin followers liked to say. Decision-making power for the network resided with the people who joined it, in proportion to the computing power they provided.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe allure of new riches provided the incentive to join: Every 10 minutes, new Bitcoins would be released and given to one of the computers helping maintain the system. In the lingo of Bitcoin, these computers were said to be mining for currency. They also served as accountants for the network.\n\nFor the first few years, aside from its use as a payment method on the Silk Road, an online drug market that has since been shut down, Bitcoin failed to gain much traction. It burst into the world’s consciousness in 2013 when the price of the digital money began to spike, in no small part because Chinese investors began trading Bitcoins in large numbers.\n\nMr. Lee said the Chinese took quickly to Bitcoin for several reasons. For one thing, the Chinese government had strictly limited other potential investment avenues, giving citizens a hunger for new assets. Also, Mr. Lee said, the Chinese loved the volatile price of Bitcoin, which gave the fledgling currency network the feeling of online gambling, a very popular activity in China.\n\nThere has been widespread speculation that Chinese people have used Bitcoin to get money out of the country and evade capital controls, but Mr. Lee and other experts said the evidence suggests this is not a significant phenomenon.\n\nChina’s Bitcoin Dominance Chinese companies mined about 70 percent of all new Bitcoins produced in the last month. Miners receive Bitcoins and have decision-making power over changes to the Bitcoin software, roughly in proportion to the amount of computing power they devote to the network. Share of Bitcoin mining blocks May 24 to June 24, 2016 CHINESE COMPANIES 26.3 % F2Pool 20.1 Antpool 12.6 BTCC Pool 11.9 BW.com 9.0 BitFury 4.8 Slush 3.3 KnCMiner 4.5 others 7.6 unknown\n\n“No Chinese person is pushing for Bitcoin because it’s libertarian or because it’s going to cause the downfall of governments,” said Mr. Lee, who moved to China after growing up in Africa and the United States and studying at Stanford. “This was an investment.”\n\nThe extent of the speculative activity in China in late 2013 pushed the price of a single Bitcoin above $1,000. That surge — and the accompanying media spotlight — led China’s government to intervene in December 2013 and cut off the flow of money between Chinese banks and Bitcoin exchanges, popping what appeared to be a Bitcoin bubble.\n\nThe frenzy, though, awakened interest in another aspect of the currency: Bitcoin mining.\n\nPeter Ng, a former investment manager, is one of the many people in China who moved from trading Bitcoins to amassing computing power to mine them. First, he mined for himself. More recently he has created data centers across China where other people can pay to set up their own mining computers. He now has 28 such centers, all of them filled with endless racks of servers, tangled cords and fans cooling the machines.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ng, 36, said he had become an expert in finding cheap energy, often in places where a coal plant or hydroelectric dam was built to support some industrial project that never happened. The Bitcoin mining machines in his facilities use about 38 megawatts of electricity, he said, enough to power a small city.\n\nThe people who put their machines in Mr. Ng’s data centers generally join mining pools, which smooth the financial returns of smaller players. A popular one, BTCC Pool, is run by Mr. Lee’s company. This month it attracted about 13 percent of the total computational power on the Bitcoin network. The most powerful pool in China — or anywhere in the world — is known as F2Pool, and it had 27 percent of the network’s computational power last month.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Politics of Pools\n\nBig pool operators have become the kingmakers of the Bitcoin world: Running the pools confers the right to vote on changes to Bitcoin’s software, and the bigger the pool, the more voting power. If members of a pool disagree, they can switch to another pool. But most miners choose a pool based on its payout structure, not its Bitcoin politics.\n\nIt was his role overseeing BTCC Pool that got Mr. Lee invited to the meeting with the American delegation in Beijing. The head of operations at F2Pool, Wang Chun, was also there.\n\nPerhaps the most important player in the Chinese Bitcoin world is Jihan Wu, 30, a former investment analyst who founded what is often described in China as the world’s most valuable Bitcoin company. That company, Bitmain, began to build computers in 2013 using chips specially designed to do mining computations.\n\nBitmain, which has 250 employees, manufactures and sells Bitcoin mining computers. It also operates a pool that other miners can join, called Antpool, and keeps a significant number of mining machines for itself, which it maintains in Iceland and the United States, as well as in China. The machines that Bitmain retains for itself account for 10 percent of the computing power on the global Bitcoin network and are enough to produce new coins worth about $230,000 each day, at the exchange rate last week.\n\nMr. Wu and the other mining pool operators in China have often seemed somewhat surprised, and even unhappy, that their investments have given them decision-making power within the Bitcoin network. “Miners are the hardware guys. Why are you asking us about software?” is the line that Mr. Ng said he often hears from miners.\n\nThis attitude initially led most Chinese miners to align themselves with old-line Bitcoin coders, known as the core programmers, who have resisted changing the software. The miners wanted to take no risks with the money they were minting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut lately, Mr. Wu has grown increasingly vocal in his belief that the network is going to have to expand, and soon, if it wants to keep its followers. He said in an email last week that if the core programmers did not increase the number of transactions going through the network by July, he would begin looking for alternatives to expand the network.\n\nHowever the software debate goes, there are fears that China’s government could decide, at some point, to pressure miners in the country to use their influence to alter the rules of the Bitcoin network. The government’s intervention in 2013 suggests that Bitcoin is not too small to escape notice.\n\nMr. Wu dismissed that concern. He also said that as more Americans buy his Bitmain machines and take advantage of cheap power in places like Washington State, mining will naturally become more decentralized. Already, he said, 30 to 40 percent of new Bitmain machines are being shipped out of China.\n\nFor now, though, China remains dominant.\n\n“The Chinese government normally expects its businesses to obtain a leading role in emerging industries,” he said. “China’s Bitcoin businesses have achieved that.”', 'Episode 708: Bitcoin Divided\n\nEnlarge this image PHILIPPE LOPEZ/AFP/Getty Images PHILIPPE LOPEZ/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBitcoin was supposed to be the currency of the future: secure, fast, independent of any government. But if there\'s one feature a currency needs, it\'s to let you pay for things. And, recently, that\'s been a problem for Bitcoin.\n\nThe idea was always that when technical problems arose, the bitcoin community would come together to solve things. But that hasn\'t happened.

Find us: Twitter / Facebook', 'Delhi-based Bitcoin trading platform Coinsecure and US-based Bitcoin payment processor, BitPay partnered to enable merchants in India to accept Bitcoin payments and receive settlement payouts in India’s national currency, the Indian Rupee INR.\n\nBitcoin use in India and the entire South Asia has just received the required push to make the digital currency more mainstream globally as merchants in the second largest country in the world - more than a billion population - are presented with the opportunity to process its payment for the first time.\n\nMohit Kalra, CEO at Coinsecure, says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“When we talk about the size of the market- there are over 1.2 billion individuals living in India right now. India is second in population size to China. Imagine if only 0.5 billion individuals got into the market. Huge potential. For some time now, Indian merchants were able to accept payments in Bitcoin but just not receive a payout in INR. Now, Indian merchants can accept payments in Bitcoin and receive a payout in INR. Bitcoin is no longer just an ‘investment’ in India but an opportunity to buy goods from Bitcoin accepting merchants.”\n\nIndia, a tech haven\n\nCoinsecure will be the first company to use BitPay’s platform to offer Bitcoin payment processing to merchants in India and southern Asia. Aside from its population, India is a tech haven with many freelance software developers operating locally to serve a global market. This will likely ease the adoption level among the tech-savvy service providers to the wider populace.\n\nOn whether the India/South Asia region is a good market for Bitcoin, Kalra says:\n\n“Again, India has the second largest global population and many pain points with traditional options for payment. It is very difficult for individuals to obtain and use credit and debit cards in India and many do not have access to bank accounts. The fact that individuals can now obtain Bitcoins in India but also make purchases in Bitcoin, opens the door for further international e-commerce as well as enables individuals who do not have credit and debit cards to make purchases online. One other key element which can truly shakeup the Bitcoin acceptance in India is remittance. Coinsecure is not a remittance-related company but we are seeing a key interest in using Bitcoin for the international transfer of funds as India is the number one remittance receiving country.”\n\nBitcoin to win hearts of middle-class consumers\n\nCoinsecure and Bitpay’s integration coincides with the release of a new report by Ogilvy & Mather (O&M) which says the broader South Asian region - not just India - will be the epicentre of future middle-class growth, paving the way for one billion new middle-class consumers to emerge who will ‘change the shape’ of the world.\n\nThe research paper titled The Velocity 12 report identified 12 ‘velocity’ markets which would be key to middle-class consumer growth over the next decade. It is centred principally in India, but inclusive of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, and extending up to China - and to Egypt, Nigeria, Mexico, and Brazil in the other direction.\n\nThe report says:\n\n""Over the next decade, these 12 markets will be the source of the next billion middle-class consumers, which will create a critical tipping point as the middle class move from a minority to the majority of the local population in many of these markets.""\n\nCoinsecure notes on its blog that it has several merchants now accepting payment in Bitcoin including the consulting firm First Principal Ventures, design firm Lazy Eight Design, e-commerce platform Kartmagic, and personalized furniture shop Zraya.\n\nIt adds that the new development will not only enable merchants to expand their customer base through Bitcoin acceptance, bu tit will also take away their worry about price fluctuations in Bitcoin as they can receive those Bitcoin payments converted into INR into their bank accounts.\n\nKalra concludes:', ""To safeguard themselves from scams within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, investors must avoid being greedy, be logical in their analysis of opportunities and dedicate time and resources to research and education.\n\nBitcoin theft and scam is becoming more popular\n\nComplaints about loss of investments within the crypto space is becoming a common occurrence. As a result, online investment companies which deal with cryptocurrencies have recently become increasingly perceived with a negative bias. Scammers these days seem to ride on the anonymous characteristics of the industry to deceive unsuspecting investors.\n\nHashOcean and others\n\nThe latest incidence involved a supposed Bitcoin cloud mining company Hashocean whose website was inaccessible for about five days. Also, among the supposed scammers is OneFxZone, a self-acclaimed trading company who still claim to be honest, but their investors complain of their inability to access their funds.\n\nCointelegraph asked experts why scams now seem to be on the increase and how potential investors can figure out which prospect is genuine and which is not.\n\nThe three most common areas of Bitcoin scam\n\nCo-Founder and Director at SatoshiLabs, Alena Vranova tells Cointelegraph that the rise of scams and Bitcoin thefts come hand-in-hand with the rising price of Bitcoin.\n\n“The correlation was shown clearly in the Dell Secure Works research conducted in early 2014.”\n\nVranova identifies the three most common areas where Bitcoin thefts or scams occur as: through a third-party fraud, digital exposure and human error or ignorance. She says that the digital and third-party risks can be easily mitigated today with a hardware wallet such as TREZOR while distributing the risk is usually a good common practice in any investment.\n\n“Some voices call for more regulation against fraudsters exploiting poorly informed clients. I am quite opposed to that idea. In any financial services and investment opportunities, a fraud is very common, and the Bitcoin world is not an exception. As a ‘small’ example we can look at the insurance industry. The UK represents over 7% of the global insurance market and faces over 2 billion pounds in insurance fraud annually. Let's assume that the global scale of insurance fraud could be around 20 billion pounds. Now, most of those frauds are done with the help or direct involvement of independent insurance brokers and agents who usually obtain their licenses from a central bank or a similar state-regulated organization. On top of the losses, insurance companies are investing hundreds of millions into fraud prevention and legislators invent new obscure ‘consumer protection’ rules. Yet the preventive effects of the latter are questionable and the cost of insurance only rises.”\n\nMoney invested is no longer yours\n\nHowever, Vranova points out that most investors do not realise their proper position and level of vulnerability once signed-up for any such investment packages.\n\n“Unfortunately people don't realize that it's not their funds when they transfer their Bitcoin (or money) to someone else's account: ‘It is only a promise to hold and eventually grow the sum for me.”\n\nBitcoin is Less Vulnerable than Dollar or Euro\n\nIn conclusion, Vranova says that the good news for Bitcoin is that it may be actually less prone to fraud than the US dollar or Euro. As Bitcoin is an open ledger and an open community, it is relatively easier to get feedback from the community, do research on the companies, their teams and investment parameters before making decisions.\n\nGreed, Logic and Education\n\nThe Founder of Cryptopay, a UK Bitcoin payment gateway, George Basiladze, says that the only thing which is responsible for online scams is people’s greed.\n\nAccording to Basiladze, most of the scam projects and Ponzi schemes are so easy to expose as long as greed does not get in the way. He also points out that anybody willing to undertake any form of investment must seek to understand the specific market and exercise patience.\n\nHe says:\n\n“Investors need to be reasonable and seek to understand the world of capital markets, and get educated. Another thing investors should know is that you cannot get rich quickly or get 7000% ROI without being scammed. Everything needs time and patience.”\n\nAttraction to testimonials\n\nAleksandar Matanovic of EC District Financial Services also tells Cointelegraph that a lot of people have fallen victim to online scams due to their attraction to various testimonials of other investors who may have truly earned a lot of money within the crypto industry.\n\nHe says:\n\n“There are lot of true stories about people who have earned huge amounts of money with Bitcoin, whether it is through mining, trading or something else. Because of those stories, people know it is possible to make fast profits with Bitcoin and so they are more susceptible to scammers and their schemes which promise big returns on investments.”\n\nHowever, Matanovic advises any investor to be logical when seeking genuine ventures. He also identifies greed as the factor which can cloud logical reasoning when it comes to investments:"", 'Some have said that bitcoin can be thought of as digital property, akin to a kind of virtual gold. If so, this description then raises the question – can technology be used to create entirely digital landscapes?\n\nThe developers behind a project called Urbit have spent much of the past decade trying to answer that question. It\'s through this concept that the project, developed by a startup called Tlon, has attracted support from Silicon Valley powerhouses like Andreessen Horowitz and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.\n\nUrbit is a network of personal cloud computers that, according to its founders, aims to create a means through which individuals can run their own servers without having to go through the trouble of running complicated server infrastructure.\n\nDescribed by its creators as a ""virtual city"", the project dates back to the mid-2000s and is the the brainchild of Curtis Yarvin, a programmer who has stoked controversy in the past for his ""neo-reactionary"" political writings under the pen name Mencius Moldbug. Despite attracting criticism over the years, the project is pushing ahead, and last night completed an initial sale of sever addresses.\n\nSo what does this have to do with bitcoin and blockchain?\n\nAs its online documentation makes clear, Urbit itself does not use an actual blockchain (though it does share some kinship through its peer-to-peer network). Yet in the project’s white paper, bitcoin itself is frequently invoked, and in interview, Tlon co-founder Galen Wolfe-Pauly argued that Urbit could become an ideal platform for running bitcoin nodes and distributed apps.\n\nWolfe-Pauly told CoinDesk:\n\n""A blockchain is more useful when the nodes are run by actual users. Coinbase is cool, but it would be great if there was an easy way to run a full node. Urbit is well-suited to solve that problem.""\n\nWhat it looks like\n\nThe project is composed of several parts: a virtual machine (dubbed ""Nock""), an operating system (""Arvo""), a programming language (""Hoon"") and a peer-to-peer network (""Ames"").\n\nThe Urbit white paper invokes galactic imagery to describe how identities are then organized within its hierarchy. From “galaxies” to ""stars"" to “comets”, Urbit is envisioned as a virtual universe, and this extends to how identities are further generated.\n\nAs for how you actually interact with your Urbit, Wolfe-Pauly said that it depends on user preferences. Portability, he went on to say, is a key element of its design.\n\n""You would install Urbit locally and you could either pay someone to host it for you in the cloud or easily host it yourself in the cloud,” he explained. “Or, if you were really concerned about privacy, it’s really easy to install it on an old Linux box and put it in your closet.”\n\nThe project is still very much in its early stages.\n\nWolfe-Pauly told CoinDesk that for now, it’s primarily developers who would be interested in using Urbit. As it stands, the project exists in testnet form and can be downloaded today.\n\nBitcoin and Urbit\n\nIn addition to its peer-to-peer nature, Urbit shares bitcoin’s concept of resource scarcity. Identities on the network are artificially restricted, and earlier this week, the team sold 1,020 Urbit “stars” for $256 apiece, netting the project $209,100.\n\nAs the crowdsale progressed – it sold out over the course of several hours – bitcoin startup 21 Inc CEO and A16Z board member Balaji Srinivasan drew a comparison between bitcoin and Urbit, arguing that ""if IP addresses were P2P tradeable like bitcoin, they\'d be Urbit address space"".\n\nBut the similarities, if they can be called that, start to end here.\n\nAs it exists today, Urbit doesn’t share the globally distributed nature of bitcoin, and as its white paper outlines, the hierarchical structure of the Urbit “universe” differs from the even playing-field model espoused in Satoshi Nakamoto’s bitcoin paper.\n\nAs it exists today, Urbit is largely centralized (owing to its nascent deployment), though Wolfe-Pauly says that, should its ecosystem grow, the overall structure of Urbit’s network should become more distributed.\n\nGalaxy image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The UK’s decision to exit the European Union (EU) at their referendum prompted global shockwaves. Stock markets have been volatile, Sterling crashed against the US dollar and euro, while gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were beneficiaries. So, alternatives do need considering.\n\nThe only constant is change and we are now faced with a period of uncertainty - possibly prolonged - as to where this will all end up. Amid the turmoil there are always opportunities. The referendum was not really about the EU, and the causes for which it was the most visible symptom apply far beyond the UK. It might also start off a domino effect with EU member states calling it a day.\n\nIt was about widespread dissatisfaction: about the state of government in the 21st century, about representation and inequality, about the engagement of the gatekeepers and power-holders with the people they are supposed to serve. And this sentiment, which can be seen across Europe and America, is critical to the emergence of a new suite of technologies and the mentality that is driving their adoption.\n\nNo 'Crypto' Borders\n\nCryptocurrency or digital money not only does not understand the concept of borders and nationalities: it doesn’t know they exist. These platforms are truly international. It’s as easy and fast to send money to Europe or Australia as it is to send it to your friend next door.\n\nThe vision encapsulated by such a technology informs its use, and it is common to find dispersed groups, located around the world, using the blockchain or distributed ledger to raise money, issue assets and pay their shareholders amongst many other things.\n\nKickstarting Start-Ups\n\nThis is the landscape into which steps CCEDK, a company that was originally founded as a crypto exchange enabling users to convert bitcoin and fiat money into different virtual currencies.\n\nNow as a rebranded entity, Crypto Coins Enterprises DK (CCEDK ApS), the former crypto exchange based in Denmark, has revamped its platform showing the way to a new era of crowdfunding. With an improved front-end design and various new services it is scheduled to launch at the start of July and in connection with US Independence Day.\n\nThe move and thinking reflects the fact that the sector has changed rapidly. Indeed, it became apparent to CCEDK that it could serve its customers better by acting not primarily as an exchange, but as a gateway into the world of the blockchain.\n\nAs Ronny Boesing, CEO of CCEDK, puts it: “Instead of merely profiting from fees on currency conversions - a ‘shovel-maker’ in the digital gold rush if you like - the company could use its experience and knowledge of the crypto world to make a real difference.”\n\nBlockchain & Crowdfunding\n\nCentral to the vision is the idea that blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way businesses gain their first toe-hold in the market, as their entrepreneurs guide them from inception and start-up phase through to being profitable and established companies.\n\n“Our vision is to be the enterprise that best understands and satisfies the product, service and funding needs of start-ups - globally,” asserts US-educated Boesing who likes to ride a more than just one horse in the crypto exchange space.\n\nMoney matters for start-ups. And, this will be one of CCEDK’s primary aims: to bring what they tout as “great new ideas and people” to the attention of global investors who are searching for returns in troubled times. Or, those who are dissatisfied with the state of traditional finance and intrigued by the concept of the sharing economy.\n\nCrowdfunding over the blockchain enables ordinary people to access investment opportunities that they would never otherwise even see. The exciting feature of crowdfunding with cryptocurrency is that allows the investor to trade their investment immediately on the trading platform OpenLedger. This is claimed by Boesing to be unlike standard crowdfunding where one might have to wait until a real product is in fact made available on the market.\n\nIt allows entrepreneurs to access funding that they might never otherwise receive. And, CCEDK intends to act as escrow, which derives its name from the Old French word escroue (scrap of paper or parchment), and generally refers to money held by a third-party on behalf of transacting parties.\n\nBasically OpenLedger offers third parties to hold an amount on a specific account short term for further use for funds, providing an administrative and legal hub for investors.\n\nBoesing reveals that his grand aim is to be able eventually to involve the National Trade Councils and their regional offices in countries around the world, working with start-ups chosen through local competitions.\n\n“We will then help bring this project to life for the world to see and to offer it to investors through a crowdfunding process, giving them a stake in the future company and revenues,” the Dane adds.\n\nSpecifically, the exchange will head up this stage and cover the costs involved, in return for a percentage of the funds raised. However, the picture doesn’t begin and end there.\n\nDecentralized Conglomerate\n\nCCEDK has retained at least one feature from its previous incarnation. It purports to be the de facto fiat gateway for the blockchain: a means of moving regular currencies like USD, EUR and CNY (Yuan) into virtual ones like Bitcoin, Litecoin and a raft of others.\n\nIt supports the OpenLedger platform, a 'peer-to-peer' (P2P) cryptocurrency platform designed for high-speed transactions with all of its capabilities built around this.\n\nSuch capabilities encompass: (1) Security (No one can freeze, seize, hack or attack your wealth and your identity can never be stolen; (2) Acceptance (You can spend your money instantly and anywhere where major debit cards are accepted); (3) Privacy (Only those you authorize can see your accounts). While the exchange makes its ledgers public for transparency, you can keep yours private); and, (4) Signature Accounts (Share control of accounts with friends, family, and business associates with complete accountability).\n\nUsers can trade crypto-assets in near-real time through the platform, securely and with what are described as “ultra-low fees”. For example, native tokens like BitShares (BTS) and its SmartCoins have fees close to zero, and its digital tokens like OBITS, launched last November, BTSR and ICOO as well as outside crypto currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and fiat-pegged Tether USDT and EURT are all traded with fees normally ranging between 0.3% and 0.2%.\n\nBuilt on top of the MIT-licensed Graphene technology of BitShares 2.0, it acts as the foundation for the Decentralized Conglomerate, an ecosystem of interlinked and mutually-supporting assets and services. These are instrumental to the benefits that CCEDK will offer start-ups. Think of CCEDK in its new incarnation like the operational brain of the Decentralized Conglomerate.\n\nAs a whole, these form the Decentralized Conglomerate ecosystem, which is designed to boost the chances of success for entrepreneurs, whilst simultaneously rewarding its own stakeholders. Alignment of interests and incentives is key to the sharing economy.\n\nNew Services\n\nSome of these services include promotion - marketing. This is something every business needs but the rules change in the decentralized world of the blockchain. Start-ups can choose to access as much or as little of the services offered through the exchange as they want plus the crowdfunding and escrow elements offered by CCEDK.\n\nFor example, BitTeaser, an advertising network service based is in the fray, is much like Google ’s AdSense, but one that charges and pays out in crypto coins. This initiative set out to be built on blockchain technology.\n\nMeanwhile, OBITS, a digital token blockchain powered via the platform OpenLedger and people driven on the base of the OBITS Bloggers’ Club 500, is a new type of sharing economy where it is possible to earn a share of the fees generated by the platform OpenLedger.\n\nOBITS represents a large share of digital token revenue expected to be generated - not just by current initiatives - but also future ones added by CCEDK over the coming years. The Bloggers’ Club 500 furthermore affords a steady stream of content onto blogs and websites around the world and can serve as a useful resource for new businesses to tap into.\n\nICOO & Crowdfunding 3.0\n\nIn terms of funding, the so-called Initial Coin Offering OpenLedger (ICOO) asset, a digital token powered by an Economic Enterprise Engine - Crowdfunding 3.0 aims to bring together investors and interesting investment opportunities.\n\nFor the uninitiated ICOO represents a pool of money that can be used to invest in potentially promising new assets which, after a broader crowdfund has been completed, are released as their own standalone assets to trade on OpenLedger.\n\n“We hope that by doing this we will be able to help fund innovative new projects that might otherwise struggle to receive funding,” Boesing says. “Who knows, perhaps one day we’ll play a part in launching the next Skype or Apple , and giving inventors and developers a chance to make their dreams a reality.”\n\nIn short, ICOO is your ticket to all the most promising ICO’s in one place, providing the option to trade a coin from day 1 of an ICO, and a way to earn rewards taking part in the BitTeaser Ambassador’s program or the OBITS Bloggers’ Club 500.\n\nIt is also a token and investment with an exit. People can always sell ICO token at level 1 ICO price until final launch. Furthermore, a buy-back of funds and a ‘burning’ process reduces the overall supply, which is claimed to allow a “natural growth” in the remaining funds over time.\n\nCCEDK has access to national and international media outlets and plans to hold several crowdfunds and asset launches per month, including one selected through a local competition. It is understood that this will follow a due diligence process and be subject to participation criteria.\n\nThe mission is to make CCEDK the “preferred marketing and crowdfunding partner” for their clients according to Boesing by “delivering outstanding value, continuous innovation and an exceptional client experience.”\n\nBut it will also require constantly fulfilling expectations through digital leadership, cooperation and cross-promotion across ecosystems. The expected soft launch of CCEDK’s new website commences on 1 July 2016 and may soon be showing us the way forward."", 'The following page reviews the best hardware available today in order to make some sort of a profit with Bitcoin mining.\n\nIf you’re completely new to Bitcoin mining please read our “Is Bitcoin mining still profitable?” post before moving on. It will give you a good idea about the profitability of mining and will make you think twice before entering this very competitive niche.\n\nIf however, you are aware of the competitive nature of Bitcoin mining and still want to get in the game, here you will be able to find the best Bitcoin mining hardware available. The good news is that there’s not many mining hardware companies left that make ASIC miners so choosing will probably be easy. That’s also the bad news. Even though many websites state long lists of Bitcoin mining hardware, only a handful of mining rigs can deal with the rising Bitcoin mining difficulty that’s out there these day.\n\nHow to compare Bitcoin miners\n\nBelow is a side by side comparison of all relevant miners. Underneath the table you’ll be able to see a summarized review of each of the miners. Keep in mind that in order to see how profitable you can be with any Bitcoin miner you’ll need to make some calculations based on your electricity cost, the Bitcoin exchange rate and the increase in difficulty throughout time.

Users who have purchased it seem mostly pleased with the device. However this is an outdated device and with today’s mining difficulty and decreasing block reward you won’t make more than 0.05 BTC each money in revenue. This means you’ll need to run it for about one year and 8 months to get a full Bitcoin. Some customers also complained about the device being too noisy, but that’s just how a miner works – it’s loud and hot.\n\n\n\nClick here to learn more about the AntMiner S5\n\nAvalon 6 BitcoinMiner Summorized Review\n\nThe Avalon 6 is a great contender for both S5 and S7 AntMiners. From the small amount of reviews that can be found online people are saying that it’s not nearly as loud as your usual miner and the hash rate is pretty reasonable. However at the current price tag I see little reason to choose it over the competition, it’s $100 more than the S7 that brings to the table superior results.\n\n\n\nUsing the Avalon 6 you can make a revenue of 0.12BTC each month, hardly something to write home about at the moment.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Avalon 6\n\nAntMiner S7 Bitcoin Miner Summorized Review\n\nThe AntMiser S7 was the raining champion up until a few months ago. Even at today’s difficulty levels and with the block reward halving you can still make 0.15BTC a month. It’s not a lot at the moment but if the Bitcoin price continues to rise it may be a profitable investment.\n\n\n\nHowever I would’t suggest buying this rig due to the fact that it’s neither here nor there. It’s too expensive for an entry level device and it’s too weak to generate any substantial amount of Bitcoins. Users who bought the device seem generally happy with it however it was first introduced on August 2015, so it’s not that new.\n\nClick here to learn more about the AntMiner S7\n\nAntMiner S9 Bitcoin Miner Summorized Review\n\nThe most advanced and most efficient Bitcoin miner today. If you’re serious about Bitcoin mining this is your rig. But since this miner just came out it’s possible that Bitcoin mining difficulty will now increase even more. At the current difficulty this miner can mine around 0.5 Bitcoins every month which makes it seem pretty profitable. However we did not take into account the electricity costs, pool fees and hardware cost. Not to mention the fact the difficulty can rise and the Bitcoin price can drop.\n\n\n\nIt seems that even though this is the toughest miner out there, there’s only a small amount of time until it too will become outdated. Until that happens though, it looks like a pretty reliable piece of equipment.\n\nClick here to learn more about the AntMiner S9\n\nAntminer R4 Bitcoin Miner Summarized Review\n\nThe Antminer R4 is intended for hobby mining – basically people who want to mine Bitcoins at home. Even though it can’t compete with the S9 it will probably be a good contender for the S7. The main advantage it has over other miners is the fact that it is has a specialized cooling unit that is much quieter than any other Bitcoin miner out there – since it’s made for a home environment.\n\n\n\nAccording to our calculations this miner should break even in about 12 months making it a pretty risky investment as most miners become obsolete after 6-9 months. However if Bitcoin’s price continues to rise this miner may yet yield a good return on investment.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Antminer R4\n\nAvalon 7 Bitcoin Miner Summarized Review\n\nThe avalon 721 (or Avalon 7 as it is known commonly) is the latest Bitcoin miner supplied by Avalon in late 2016. It has a lower price tags than most of the advanced miners but is also less powerful. It seems to be a good choice for people who are looking for a cheaper entry level miner and don’t want to go for an Antminer S7.\n\nAccording to our calculations this miner should break even in about 24 months, making it a pretty risky investment. You can also connect up to 5 Avalon 721s in a row creating a powerful 30 TH/s mining rig.\n\nClick here to view deals on the Avalon 7', 'Plutus, a new start-up based in London, allows any merchant with contactless card terminals to accept bitcoin and ethereum payments regardless of whether the merchant has in fact adopted bitcoin or ethereum.\n\nUtilizing the new NFC technology, Plutus aims to make physical Bitcoin and Ethereum payments as easy as tap and go, with merchants not being aware the payment was a digital currency based transaction, ensuring almost universal acceptance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe Plutus app, showcased in a video, converts Ethereum or Bitcoin on the fly, with the actual payment made in fiat. Showcasing the prototype, after depositing ethereum, a Tesco’s customer, one of the largest supermarkets in UK, simply taps the phone on the contactless terminal and in seconds finishes his payment.\n\nExchange Out by Autumn, App by Winter 2016\n\nThe app is not yet ready to launch. Filip Martinka, CCO of Plutus, speaking to CCN stated that plutus’ showcase video was using a “centralized exchange for the prototype.” They aim to use a decentralized exchange for the actual product, called PlutusDEX, “which will be a smart contract, and liquidity will be provided by the users themselves.”\n\nThe exchange is in the “very, very early stages of testing” and a “one way exchange process.” Buyers deposit fiat to an “escrow”, which is a bank account controlled by Plutus, with sellers sending their instant orders as they deposit their btc or eth to the app.\n\nThe exchange is expected to launch sometime during Autumn 2016, after a “formal security audit” combined with bounties for the prototype. The app, however, is ready to go, but won’t launch until winter 2016.\n\nOnce the app is operational, users will have to go through a registration and KYC process to comply with current regulations:\n\n“This is enforced on us at this point in time, but it is a small price to pay for the convenience. Only one authentication will be required to use Plutus worldwide.”\n\nOnce users are registered they can deposit bitcoin or ethereum, which is an on-chain transaction, requiring a waiting time for transaction confirmation. “We cannot [accept 0-confirmation] due to the structure of the system,” says Martinka. For bitcoin, three confirmations will be necessary which usually takes 30 minutes. For ethereum it is almost instant as 1-3 confirmations are required which is only 40 seconds.\n\nAlso read: An Interview with the Makers of Plutus, a Payment App for the BTC Adopter\n\nOnce the transaction is confirmed, the digital currency is instantly exchanged into USD, GBP, EUR or soon CNY on PlutusDEX, allowing for the payment to be made at any merchant that accepts contactless cards. The payment itself is sent by an “FCA-approved Virtual Debit Card provider by VISA.” Exact details of their banking relationships were not provided as “the partnership can only be signed once we have determined… market size, estimated volume, audience and other criteria.”\n\nPlutus is in contact with UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, but:\n\n“We are not the card issuers nor do we exchange funds internally, so no MSB or similar licenses are required. But we have to perform KYC with an FDA authorized VDC issuer.”\n\nConsidering that buyers would need to deposit fiat to Plutus’ bank account, that may not be the case, but UK is renown as the friendliest jurisdiction for Fintech. Their compliance with KYC should make it easy to acquire a license if necessary.\n\nPlutus has Plutons, an Ethereum Token\n\nPlutus is currently undergoing a crowdsale which began on the 21st of June and is to end on the 30th of June. They have already raised more than half a million, according to Martinka, and, learning from the DAO, have implemented a maximum cap of 15,000 bitcoins, currently valued at approximately $10 million.\n\nThe new Ethereum based token, Pluton, has two main functions. Funds raised from the sale of 850,000 plutons will mainly go towards development. While a far bigger amount of more than 19 million plutons will be used for rebate, based on a “longevity calculator.”\n\nAs the contactless payment app uses the current financial infrastructure, there will be fees of 1-4 percent of bitcoin or ethereum deposits. In return, users are given a rebate in pluton tokens decided by the “longevity calculator” which currently suggests 3%.\n\nPluton token holders pay no deposit fee or any fee at all, while being able to use the app as if they deposited eth or btc, as well as need not in any way wait for a confirmation as 0-confirmations of pluton payments are accepted. Furthermore, exchange trading of any digital currency or fiat is fully free.\n\nPromising App if it can Deliver\n\nThe merging of digital currency with contactless payments has the potential to turn bitcoin or ethereum into an almost universally accepted currency as most merchants now employ NFC technology. This will allow individuals currently paid in digital currency to spend their funds at the local corner shop, say, when for some reason your card does not work or if you forgot your wallet or if you simply want to spend your digital currency.\n\n“Our philosophy is that bitcoin/ethereum entrepreneurs, miners, holders, traders, freelancers, remitttance recipients and others shouldn’t have to wait for merchants to create new infrastructure.” Says Matinka with Plutus’ CEO, Danial Daychopan adding:\n\n“Our goal from the beginning was to create a practical use-case for the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems that is easy to use.”\n\nPlutus’ team, which has a “combined experience of over forty years in payments, financial trade and software development” according to their website, may be able to develop what seems to be a very promising application, allowing anyone who has ethereum or bitcoin to spend them as if fiat, making digital currencies almost universally accepted in an instant.\n\nHowever, although the team seems experienced and professional based on their profiles, readers are of course advised that this is a bleeding edge frontier. The app has complex arrangements with smart contract based exchanges on ethereum’s blockchain which itself is a barely months old technology. Risk is plentiful and can be devastating leading to complete losses of funds.\n\nOn the other hand, if Plutus successfully and competently delivers one of the holy grails in this space, almost universal merchant acceptance of bitcoin and ethereum payments, the whole ecosystem may up a gear as ethereum and bitcoin gain their full quality of actual money.\n\nFeatured image from Vimeo/Plutus.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The top five blockchain crowdsales bore out of the Bitcoin 2.0 movement have raised more than a quarter-of-a-billion dollars in “initial coin offerings,” “token sales” and the like. Participants contend the blockchain tokens are going “to the moon.” Others argue, since they’ve never been registered, they run afoul of securities law.\n\nThe second largest crowdsale and best known, is Ethereum at $18,439,086. Ethereum developers say their blockchain is a distributed smart-contract platform “fueled” by a native digital currency similar to Bitcoin. Ethereum’s 2014 “Ether sale” preceded it’s May 2016 crowdsale for the DAO, a so-called “decentralized autonomous organization” managed via Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nEthereum and DAO developers currently face scrutiny in the wake of a $55 million compromise of the DAO by an attacker. They are deciding whether to intervene and undo the damage done by the draining of funds.\n\nDAO token holders, who purchased the tokens with Ether, vote on “important decisions relating to the management of the DAO,” the project claims. The DAO had raised Ethereum worth over $200 million at the time of the attack.\n\nThe top five blockchain crowdsales: the DAO, Ethereum, WAVES, Lisk, Digix and Augur, have raised approximately $200 million. Nearly $170 million of that is Ethereum and the DAO.\n\nLisk, a cryptocurrency and decentralized application platform, raised $5,880,089 in an “initial coin offering” in 2016. Lisk founders worked on the code for three weeks before going public.\n\n“In the following three weeks we built up enough momentum to start our crowdfunding,” Lisk co-founder, Max Kordek, told me. The crowdfunding went on for one month and Lisk brought in more than 14,000 bitcoins.\n\nKordek emphasizes the importance of marketing and calls Lisk’s “intensive marketing campaign” a “huge success.”\n\nSecurities Law\n\nDevelopers say they are providing access to software, not securities. The literature is littered with finance and security terms. Securities laws are broadly interpreted and designed to be adaptable to the innovative ways people raise funds.\n\nCongress developed federal securities law after the stock market crash of 1929. The speculative frenzy ending in the October 1929 panic, called “Black Thursday,”led Congress to enact the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1945 (the “Exchange Act”).\n\nState blue sky laws, Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, as well as regulations from the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) combine to create securities law.\n\nSEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (1946) set the precedent that an investment contract entails the giving of money to others who manage and control the funds with the expectation of profit.\n\nBlockchain crowdsales market that token holders and “community” participants themselves, enjoy management and control of the blockchain software. Indicating that they, themselves, help build the blockchain platform over time. DAO participants, for instance, use Ether toward the DAO projects they support. Lisk says that participants earn Lisk for bug bounties.\n\nIf blockchain crowdsale participants enjoy management and control, then it’s arguably not an investment contract or security. Still, developers generally lack management and control over an enterprise in the real world.\n\nWho would shareholders petition to obtain redress when something goes awry? Core developers on Ethereum, etc. argue that “smart contracts,” that is, the distributed software itself, handles everything.\n\nJason Seibert, a lawyer who serves on Bitcoin and securities cases, described a typical blockchain crowdsale: “Hey, give us some money and we are going to develop something. We are not quite sure what it is yet but when we do, you’ll be able to use this stuff for it, even though we don’t know what it is yet.”\n\nEven if the blockchain crowdsales are, in fact, crowdsales and not securities offerings, they must still be registered under the JOBS Act and regulation.\n\nIllustrating the nuance of securities laws, Seibert evokes baseball cards:\n\n“Nobody thinks baseball card manufacturers print baseball cards with the intent of them being an investment,” the Oregon-based lawyer, who represented Trendon Shavers in the first Bitcoin criminal fraud case in the U.S., said. “Come on, it’s sold in a pack of gum! But everyone knows that people can collect them and trade them and make money off of them.”\n\nBlockchain crowdsales come across much differently. They’re not bubble gum and pictures of athletes. “We’re talking about an investment opportunity,” Seibert says.\n\nHeretofore, blockchain crowdsales have enjoyed the unwritten “good deal exception,” wherein, since everybody is happy, nobody files lawsuits or tips off relevant officials.\n\nThat the DAO smart contract platform was drained of $55 million and core Ethereum developers are considering implementing a fork to roll back the perceived heist, it remains to be seen if the “good deal exception” will soon expire. An SEC official commented June 20 that the $55 million attack against Ethereum underscores concerns over blockchain systems.\n\nThanks to the DAOs code, Ethereum developers could intervene and undo the $55 million drain. But that might be used in a court against them as proof they held control over Ethereum and the DAO. The DAO would not have truly been a “decentralized autonomous organism,” as advertised, and participants could then be seen as misled investors.\n\n“You’ll generally hear an investor say, ‘Had I know this-or-that, perhaps I would not have invested,” Seibert explained.']"

This means many people looking to gamble with bitcoin might prefer the privacy offered by the digital currency over traditional currencies.\n\nTowards that end, there are certain tools and techniques a player could use in order evade the eye of law enforcement. Of course, it is not easy to hide bitcoins. It takes a certain level of skill. Not even the Silk Road’s administrator, who went by Dread Pirate Roberts, could master the nuances of the dark web.\n\nAlthough you generally won’t need to do so, you might choose to download software to gamble online with bitcoins; for instance, you might decide to use a Bitcoin wallet client which requites download and installation. On the other hand, some bitcoin casinos require users download client software and install it on a computer.\n\nThere are many Android, iPhone based gambling sites or applications on smartphones. These apps are available on Google Play Store and Apple Store.\n\nBefore one starts gambling with Bitcoin online, one needs to buy Bitcoin or the other digital currencies (ever heard of CLAMs?) that are used.\n\nMany bitcoin casinos double as faucets upon registering on their website, referring a new player to play a new game and others.\n\nThere are numerous ways to do acquire bitcoins. You can sign up for an account at Local Bitcoins, Coinbase, offer goods or services for bitcoin or perhaps buy bitcoins from a friend.\n\nOnce you own bitcoins, there are many options to keep a pulse on the market. There are, also, many different ways to gamble online with bitcoin. There are all sorts of options, including even prediction markets for the weather. SatoshiDice is one of the biggest websites, and represented the first large Bitcoin business buyout when then owner Erik Vorhees sold the website for $11.5 million.\n\nFor some people, there could be problems.\n\nThe US government has outlawed online gambling, The Justice Department has demonstrated one cannot open an offshore casino online. Bitcoin is considered money, in the eyes of many law enforcement agencies.\n\n“We don’t have a bank account at Seals with Clubs,” says Bryan Micon, the spokesperson for SealsWithClubs.eu, a Bitcoin-based poker site, told NPR. “There’s no bank account. There’s no bank of any sort that we do. We only do this one weird brand-new Internet protocol transaction that some of the nerds out there are calling money.” For that NPR story, the Justice Department declined to comment on the legal status of gambling with Bitcoin, but Bryan Micon was later raided for offering such services without licenses.\n\nDepending on where you reside, you will need to keep abreast of Bitcoin laws as well as laws for online gambling. Bitcoin casinos do need licenses under regulatory bodies from the country where it operates. Many have them. There are many bitcoin casinos, nevertheless, that don’t possess licenses. This is a risk to your personal data, if the website has any of it.\n\nIt might be a good idea not to convert winnings from bitcoin gambling into your local currency if it’s illegal to gamble online where you reside.\n\nMany Bitcoin gambling sites offer a certain innovation over traditional online gambling. “Provably fair” is an important concept in online gambling with bitcoins. Bitcoin’s cryptographic hash function allows provably fair gambling.\n\nA secret seed is created at random and encrypted into the hashcode by the server. The hashed code. A player receives a random client seed, and both seeds are mixed up with an encrypted function for the result. The player receives the server seed to verify client.\n\nThis does not allow a casino to cheat a paper. There could be other tricks by a casino. Reading reviews is very important, and feedback of past players and the casino reviewing websites like this one for more details.\n\nReviews and feedback can inform a player if a certain website is probably fair, and you can read different reviews and feedback about casinos on multiple websites.\n\nHow long one receives funds should not take too long, but does differ from website to website. It does take up to half a day at some websites and these transactions are marked pending in your website account in the meantime.\n\nThe depositing into and cashing out of bitcoin do not take much time. For smaller amounts, it is very fast, and possibly instant at this point, if you have your wallet account ready to use. But, for larger amounts, it may take two to ten hours to deposit or cash no time at all. You won’t need a credit card.\n\nMany websites do not have a minimum deposit. Many websites have no minimum deposit. The commonly used unit, Milli0bitcoin (mBTC), means that if you deposit one bitcoin, it is converted to 1000 mBTC. These units are used when playing games.\n\nBTC is bitcoin’s abbreviation. An mBTC is a thousandth part of a BTC, and the millionth part of a Bitcoin is called a uBTC. mBTC is very popular in Bitcoin gambling.\n\nWhy Bitcoin?\n\nUsing bitcoins have many advantages over traditional currencies in online gambling. Bitcoin gaming sites, very simple, are faster. You can sign up with just an email address and there are seldom transaction processing fees.\n\nBitcoin gambling is legal where any form online gambling is legal. There is no separate Bitcoin gambling legislation. Despite the illegality of online Bitcoin gambling in the US, many websites allow US players.\n\nIn summation, there are plenty of reasons to use Bitcoin when it comes to Bitcoin gambling, such as speed. Whereas in online gambling, many players wait days for payouts, with bitcoin it can be instant. Other people like the privacy features.\n\nBitcoin’s cryptographic hash basis and blockchain technology allow for Bitcoin games to be “provably fair”; that is, fairer than others.\n\nThis added transparency, and no added credit card fees form the basis for the online gambling complex.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A new research report by Citi Research asserts that bitcoin and other digital currencies should not be viewed as a disruptive threat to banks, credit card networks or traditional remittance providers, but rather as a potential complement to existing services.\n\nPublished today, the 56-page report argues bitcoin and digital currencies are better equipped to open up new markets and reach new consumers, and that today’s centralized payment systems are already efficient enough for today\'s commerce.\n\nStill, Citi does see opportunity in using a public blockchain.\n\nThe report reads:\n\n""The power behind an open network like bitcoin is the possibility of incorporating it with other technologies to bring about true innovation, such as applications that support the Internet of Things (eg machine-to-machine payments).""\n\nNotably, the report found bitcoin and digital currencies could be impactful in emerging markets, where payments systems are not as developed.\n\n""In countries where there is no quality payments infrastructure, we do think there could be some opportunity for an open decentralized network like bitcoin,"" the report states.\n\nElsewhere, the report sought to apply a critical eye in determining whether bitcoin’s characteristics have benefits for payments. For example, the authors stated that they don\'t necessarily believe immutability, or the incorruptibility of bitcoin’s blockchain, is well-suited for money movement.\n\nThe report went on to mention a number of specific blockchain and bitcoin startups, while providing overviews digital currency and blockchain networks including Ripple, bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nTranserWise advantage\n\nIn remittances, long claimed as one of the biggest areas of impact by enthusiasts, the report found that the UK-based money transfer service TransferWise remains cheaper to use for cross-border payments today.\n\nOf note, however, is that the report graded bitcoin against account-to-account remittance option and TransferWise in 10 remittance corridors, finding that it was only the lowest-cost option in one corridor, money transfers from the US to New Zealand.\n\nIn outbound corridors from the US, bitcoin was found to be cheaper than account-to-account options only in US-to-China transfers.\n\nThe report estimated fees on these transactions at 3.86% for account-to-account transactions and 3.38% on bitcoin transfers. By contract, fees for TransferWise payments cost just 1.48%.\n\nThe researchers also pointed to the high cost of converting bitcoin into fiat currency and the low liquidity in existing markets as challenges it believes the system will need to overcome.\n\nLarger critiques\n\nMore broadly, the report sought to challenge popularly held conceptions about the bitcoin network, including its use in existing financial business models.\n\n""We believe an open network like bitcoin combined with mobile, machine learning, big data and the Internet of Things has the potential to create radically new models,"" the report reads.\n\nCiti, for instance, said there is a ""misperception"" that bitcoin provides a system for frictionless transactions, while disputing that running payments through its blockchain would continue to be low-cost long term.\n\n""Since the network incurs substantial energy-related costs due to proof-of-work, we believe that these costs will eventually be borne by the users through high transaction fees, which will make it more expensive than centralized networks,"" the report contends.\n\nIn other areas such as speed, scalability and resiliency, the report argued bitcoin and digital currencies don’t necessarily have advantages.\n\nIt went on to call payment systems “resilient”, while questioning that bitcoin’s network could scale to support a larger number of transactions.\n\nImage credit: TungCheung / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

According to reports, the Chinese government is planning on having a set of laws that will offer digital currencies such as the popular bitcoin a “legal status” in the country.\n\nThe new draft law, released as part of the People’s Republic of China General Principles of Civil Law, aims to consider cryptocurrencies as properties “almost on par with physical and financial assets,” meaning they will be under the scope of the civil rights related to property in general.\n\nDigital currencies don’t have a legal status in China, although experts have been attributing the recent surge in the price of bitcoin to the hearty demand from the Chinese market due to fears of Chinese yuan devaluation. In May, the digital currency to hit $500—a value not seen since September 2014—in two of China’s largest bitcoin exchanges, OKCoin and Huobi, and analysts believe trades involving the yuan account for about 95 percent of the current bitcoin trading volume this year.\n\nChina’s draft law, even if it is implemented into the statute, doesn’t completely cover the digital currency assets, unlike in Japan where virtual currencies are now recognized as “asset-like values” that can be used to pay for goods and services as well as an alternative for legal tender through purchases and trades.\n\nStill, the draft law is a good start for the Asian country—a move that shows Chinese bureaucrats are already recognizing bitcoin as an alternative currency.\n\nIndian merchants now accepting bitcoin payments\n\nBitcoin is no longer on the fringes of India’s financial sector.\n\nMerchants in India will soon start accepting bitcoin payments and receive digital currency-related payouts in the Indian rupee (INR), several news outlets have reported.\n\nDelhi-based bitcoin trading platform Coinsecure is the first company to use U.S. bitcoin payment processor BitPay’s platform to offer cryptocurrency payment processing in the country, as well as in south Asia.\n\nCoinsecure CEO Mohit Kalra told CoinTelegraph: “For some time now, Indian merchants were able to accept payments in bitcoin but just not receive a payout in INR. Bitcoin is no longer just an ‘investment’ in India but an opportunity to buy goods from bitcoin accepting merchants.”\n\nIndia is the latest country to have expressed interest in bitcoin and the blockchain technology. The Reserve Bank of India is planning to look into the blockchain as an alternative way to reduce the use of paper currency.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price and transaction volume\n\nOn Thursday, the price of the digital currency rose slightly to $636.22, with close to 15.72 million bitcoins in circulation.\n\nComments', 'The blocksize debate has been brought to the forefront once more as a number of Bitcoin developers, including Gregory Maxwell, CTO of Blockstream and Mark Friedenbach, Core Tech Engineer at Blockstream, came out against the Hong Kong Consensus, arguably the most important document in Bitcoin’s history since the whitepaper.\n\nAccording to what may be a leak of an alleged meeting between pools and miners representing more than 75% of hashpower, consensus has been reached to hardfork to 2mb if Bitcoin Core developers do not release a new Bitcoin Core client with a 2MB hardfork code by August the 1st 2016.\n\nI\'m hearing from sources that the #corexit #terminator story from China is legit. Block size action heating up https://t.co/Rx19wapR5r — Kristov Atlas (@kristovatlas) June 30, 2016\n\nThe above is unverified. We have reached out to seek confirmation and are informed that the statement is just a guess from the poster who is unknown, but it is not clear whether his guess is correct or otherwise. However, it is known that miners are on the move following comments by at least three prominent Bitcoin Core developers that the hardfork has no chance of being merged.\n\nThe clearest indication that something is afoot came from the uncharacteristic publication by HaoBtc, the most powerful supporter of Bitcoin Core, of an article calling for clarification regarding the Hong Kong Consensus.\n\nThe Hong Kong “Roundtable Consensus” states that “representatives from the bitcoin industry and members of the development community have agreed” to “run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core,” with a timeline of Segwit released in April 2016, the “code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.”\n\nHinting at the influence of HaoBtc, Jihan Wu, founder of Bitmain, tweeted:\n\nHaoBTC helped so much in Chinese community to defend for Core from the competition of Classic. https://t.co/LO1sef65jC — Jihan Wu (@JihanWu) June 27, 2016\n\nStriking a conciliatory tone, but making the miners position absolutely clear, HaoBtc stated:\n\n“There is no doubt that the 2mb hard fork is important in [the Roundtable Consensus] document, actually if people were not serious about it, they wouldn’t have taken the trouble to assign a deadline to it:\n\nThe code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.\n\nNow with June approaching its end and July a few days away, there has been increasing concern whether the Core devs are ready to deliver on their promise, or any effort have been made during the past months towards this end.”\n\nThe potentially leaked decision of the alleged miner’s meeting is unlikely to be fully correct in its details, but the overall theme corresponds with recent statements from miners, particularly Jihan Wu who has been more and more vocal, and, at times, uncharacteristically direct in some of his public statements, indicating a changing shift in the mining community.\n\nAnother highly influential actor, Wang Chun, founder of F2Pool, has been very quiet since he publicly stated that he felt cheated by Adam Back, President of Blockstream, signing the Roundtable Consensus in his own name, rather than as President of Blockstream, suggesting miners were under the impression that the agreement would be binding at least on blockstream founders, contractors and employees. Because of that episode, it is highly likely that Wang Chun supports a hardfork increase in a non Bitcoin Core client if Bitcoin Core Developers do not release a hardfork client.\n\nWhat seems to have significantly changed recently is the attitude of previously strong supporters of Bitcoin Core, such as HaoBtc, but also BTCC. Following a blundering comment by Gregory Maxwell, Samson Mow, the most vocal proponent of Bitcoin Core, tweeted:\n\n@austinhill @Blockstream this isn\'t the same thing. Greg doesn\'t grasp the severity of the situation & what those ""dipshits"" accomplished. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) May 22, 2016\n\nIt is the public intervention of HaoBtc, however, that gives credence to the rumors and makes them worth publishing, but, due to the many statements that miners have made some are taking the “won’t believe it, until I see it” approach. Nonetheless, price instantly increased, jumping $40 as soon as the rumor started circulating.\n\nIt is not clear how developers will now react. To not give the ecosystem choice opens Bitcoin Core developers to criticism of centralized power where developers decide even political matters of increased capacity, increasing the risk of legal liability and threatening an open war with miners which, having the full support of almost all prominent bitcoin businesses, are likely to come out much stronger.\n\nEither way, what most now emphasize is that any decision is better than no decision as no one benefits from any further dragging out of this matter. Fork or no fork, the Bitcoin community needs to make a decisive decision and put this matter behind us so that we can focus on building the future rather than draining our energy in a never ending debate.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""IBM has completed its latest blockchain project with French bank Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, an effort that found the two firms using the technology to create a system for identity verification.\n\nThe companies said the proof-of-concept uses the Hyperledger blockchain fabric to enable customers to provide proof of identity to third parties, such as local utilities and retailers. IBM and Crédit Mutuel further sought to label the proof-of-concept as one that provides evidence of how blockchain is being applied in non-financial applications.\n\nIn statements, Crédit Mutuel COO of innovation and operations Frédéric Laurent said:\n\n“This project offered a complete view of customers' documents across our distributed network and helped us to understand and master blockchain for other client uses.”\n\nGoing forward, Laurent said that the bank is now ready to “incorporate” the technology into its ecosystem, though it did not provide more details on how it may move forward on this objective.\n\nThe announcement comes as France-based financial institutions become more active in their explorations of the technology despite the more negative views of some prominent politicians.\n\nLast week, BNP Paribas and Caisse des Dépôts, for example, were among several French and European financial institutions to reveal they are working on a post-trade blockchain platform aimed at small businesses.\n\nFurther, the news comes as IBM has become increasingly active in showcasing work completed with its clients as part of its blockchain services offerings, first revealed in February.

Several multinational corporations and financial institutions have started embracing bitcoin as a legitimate payment system. Bitcoin is the most popular digital currency holding around 80% of the market share and its market cap is worth more than $10 billion currently. Bitcoin offers faster transactions with anonymity and reduced costs, making it an attractive choice for online traders. Some of the key reasons to consider Bitcoin as a good investment for 2016 are listed below,\n\nIncreased Acceptance:\n\nBitcoin is gaining popularity as more and more investors have started showing interest in this borderless digital currency. Based on certain financial reports, there has been around 44 percent increase in the number of businesses which has started accepting Bitcoin payments including major brands like PayPal, Barclays and Visa. Also Bitcoin startups have received more than $1billion in overall funding from several venture capitalists around the world. All this support from investors is considered a sign of acceptance, which has definitely resulted in a positive impact on Bitcoin’s market price. Some notable personalities like George Osborne, the UK chancellor and Larry Summers, former secretary of US treasury have expressed their approval for Bitcoin. Even the US presidential candidate of the Republican Party, Rand Paul has accepted bitcoin donations for his campaign. The year 2016 has definitely been a remarkable year for Bitcoin whose market price is expected to reach around $650 by end of this year.\n\nVolatility and Limited Supply:\n\nThe important question which arises among the minds of investors is the volatility of bitcoins as witnessed by past market trends. It has dropped to as low as $100 in Sep 2013 and suddenly moved to its peak price of $1,240 in Dec 2013. The answer lies in the fact that market price of Bitcoin is not backed by any assets or controlled by any centralized authority. Its price varies purely based on the principle of supply and demand similar to commodities like Oil and Gold. You can use bitcoins volatility to your advantage by trading binary options against it. If you can speculate the price movement of Bitcoin by analyzing the market trends, you can make money easily by trading binary options with Bitcoin as underlying asset.\n\nBitcoins are created using the mining process by solving complex algorithms and their supply is very limited, similar to the resources like Gold and silver. The rate at which Bitcoins are created is very slow and the production will be capped once the target of 21 million is reached. Considering its limited supply and predictable growth rate, Bitcoin can definitely be considered as a good investment in the long-term compared to flat currencies.\n\nLong-term growth prospects:\n\nThough Bitcoin might not yield any significant margins in the short-term, it will definitely be a worthy investment in the long-term. With more and more businesses starting to accept Bitcoin payments, you can expect lot more transactions to happen in upcoming events like Christmas shopping and Black Friday sales. The possible increase in transaction volume is estimated to cause 12% rise in Bitcoin price. This increase in price will further boost the spending among people as more merchants start accepting bitcoin payments. The long-term investors can expect Bitcoin to reach the market price as high as $1000 in the next 2-3 years. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has classified Bitcoin as a commodity which has brought some new regulations to it. This has put a check on the unregistered firms that were trading based on the derivatives of Bitcoins. Demographic of Bitcoin usage has witnessed 27% rise in every quarter among the age groups of 16-24, which is really a positive sign for investors.\n\nOpen-source and Easy Access to Anyone:\n\nBitcoin is available as an open-source system and anybody with access to Internet can start investing in it. You can open your bitcoin wallet in less than 5 minutes and track your payments easily. It is also easy to open a trading account with Bitcoin exchanges like Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase etc. through which you can start trading Bitcoins in exchange of physical currencies like USD or Euro. All the Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a distributed ledger called “Blockchain” and it can’t be lost like money. Bitcoin transactions are completely anonymous and won’t compromise your financial privacy.\n\nWhile 2015 was a relatively calm year for Bitcoin, 2016 will be much more exciting since the block halving is about to come in 9th July 2016 after which the amount of bitcoins rewarded to the miners will be reduced by 50%. Because of this reduced supply, we can anticipate some increase in market price of Bitcoins during second half of 2016. One of the best reasons to explore investment opportunities with Bitcoin is its innovative and revolutionary nature doubled with promising growth in long-term. Before making an investment with Bitcoin, you should keep yourself updated on the market trends and do some research about the costs. Since Bitcoin is now being considered as a taxable asset by the IRS, you should also plan your investments after evaluating the capital gains tax that might be imposed.', '2016 has been the year of the blockchain. The revolutionary potential of bitcoin’s underlying technology is the sexist topic in finance. So it should be no great shock that business schools are trying to decode the complex digital ledger.\n\n“Blockchain and new financial technologies in general open a number of new opportunities both for start-ups as well as for incumbents,” says Christian Catalini, assistant professor of technological innovation at MIT Sloan School of Management, who developed an intensive three-day blockchain course for MBAs.\n\nFive of the world’s top-25 ranked business schools have told BusinessBecause they have or will incorporate blockchain into their curricula — among them UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. NYU Stern this month launched a new course. And Harvard Business School, meanwhile, has developed a course that explores the technology. HBS did not comment.\n\nProfessor David Yermack, chair of NYU Stern’s finance department, says: “I think the fintech curriculum will have to be taught at every business school, because students and employers will demand it.” Schools are also covering peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, digital currencies, and fintech entrepreneurialism.\n\nBlockchain is a public, digital ledger of transactions. It uses cryptography, allowing participants to securely manipulate the ledger without a central authority.\n\nBlockchain is one of the hottest areas of finance to work in. The technology has everyone from investment banks Goldman Sachs, UBS and JPMorgan Chase, to start-ups such as Circle and Coinbase salivating at its potential uses, such as international clearing and settlements. Accenture reckons it could cut finance industry costs by $20 billion annually by 2021.\n\n“There are so many firms that need to understand this space,” says Campbell Harvey, finance professor at Duke’s Fuqua School of Business. He adds: “They want to have a so-called blockchain tsar at their firm; someone who can coordinate a multi-disciplinary effort so their firm comes out on the winning side rather than the losing side of blockchain disruption.”\n\nBlockchain was borne with bitcoin, the controversial cryptocurrency. Bitcoin scandals, such as the collapse of Mt Gox and disappearance of $500 million worth of bitcoins, have dented digital monies’ appeal. But blockchain’s famed uses spread far beyond bitcoin.\n\n“It took off by itself,” says professor Andrei Kirilenko, director Centre for Global Finance and Technology at Imperial College Business School. “It’s being looked at as a ledger that could store information about transactions outside of bitcoin.”\n\nEnticed, financial services executives are spurring a rising demand for executive education courses focused on blockchain. Advocates believe the tech has the potential to shake-up vast swaths of the financial services industry and beyond.\n\n“Fintech is coming at traditional banking from a new perspective,” says Marc Hamud, senior VP at GE Capital, who teaches MBAs about digital currencies at USC Marshall School of Business. “Our course is focusing on new business models and the potential those models have to disrupt the status quo.”\n\nWhile large lenders are eyeing fintech, they are held back by concerns over regulation and by their ageing, legacy IT systems. Ripe for disruption, the incumbents are being challenged by a tsunami of start-ups employing digital tech more effectively.\n\n“Think of somebody working for a bank — the big worry for you is that you have a bunch of legacy IT systems, and there are five people in a loft somewhere who are picking away at one of your core profitability measures,” says Raghu Rau, professor of finance at Cambridge Judge Business School.\n\nBusiness school courses are looking at how entrepreneurs can commercialize and innovate with blockchain. MBAs see the appeal.\n\nMarieke Flament is managing director for Europe at Circle, a blockchain start-up backed by $136 million from investors including Goldman, IDG China, Breyer Capital, Accel and General Catalyst.\n\nThe London Business School MBA says she wants to make money move more freely and more securely, faster: “We want money to work like the internet does.”', 'On Wednesday, the Bitcoin community went into a tizzy over BIP 75 (BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) which is, in short, a layer-2 protocol for improving the user friendliness of Bitcoin payments.\n\nThe community, especially on Reddit, is concerned that the option to identify oneself to the sender or receiver of a payment may lead down the road toward know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) restrictions on the Bitcoin protocol. The hysteria around this proposal appears to have emerged from a post made by Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd to the Bitcoin development mailing list.\n\nPeter Todd recommends boycotting BIP75 due to AML/KYC concerns.\n\nWhat Is BIP 75?\n\nBefore getting into the controversy, it’s important to understand the details of BIP 75. Bitcoin Magazine reported on the proposal’s ability to simplify wallets for the average Joe earlier this year, but here are the key points:\n\nBIP 75 attempts to solve some of the privacy and security concerns with the Payment Protocol, which was outlined by former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer, Gavin Andresen and former Bitcoin developer, Mike Hearn in BIP 70.\n\nUnlike BIP 70, BIP 75 features end-to-end encryption.\n\nHuman-readable names can be used to make the payment process more user-friendly and create a Venmo-esque experience in Bitcoin wallets.\n\nThe co-authors of BIP 75 are from Netki (Justin Newton and Matt David) and Breadwallet (Aaron Voisine and James MacWhyte).\n\nWhat Are the Concerns With BIP 75?\n\nThere are currently two separate concerns with BIP 75 being discussed in the Bitcoin community. For one, some people believe that this BIP could make it easier to trace Bitcoin payments to real-world identities or simply streamline KYC and AML compliance for Bitcoin. The other issue is whether this BIP should be included in the main BIPs section of the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository.\n\n“I\'d strongly argue that we remove BIP 75 from the BIPs repository and boycott wallets that implement it,” Peter Todd recently stated on the Bitcoin development mailing list. “It\'s bad strategy for Bitcoin developers to willingly participate in AML [and] KYC [compliance], just the same way as it\'s bad for Tor to add wiretapping functionality and W3C to support DRM tech. The minor tactical wins you\'ll get [out] of this aren\'t worth it.”\n\nA Reddit thread linking to that post on the Bitcoin development mailing list was quickly filled with calls for a boycott on Breadwallet.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Todd to gain a clearer picture of his thoughts on the matter. In terms of whether the BIP should be removed from the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository, Todd said, “I think we should remove it because, like it or not, we are putting a stamp of approval on it, to a degree.”\n\nSome others, such as Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille, believe a removal would amount to censorship; however, Todd also pointed out that, in the past, a proper BIP for a colored coins standard has also been denied access to the GitHub repo.\n\nWhen it comes to the issues he sees with BIP 75 more generally, Todd said, “BIP 75 institutionalizes [regulatory compliance] in a convenient way that everyone can easily use and expect. We should comply with AML [and] KYC [regulations] only grudgingly.\n\n“In much the same way that we have the threat of Tor nodes keeping logs; we don\'t help that process by creating a standard for those logs,” Todd added.\n\nTo Todd’s point, BIP 75 does make it easier for companies (financial in nature or not) to collect data on their customers. While the threat of a government forcing normal retailers to collect identifying information about customers who use Bitcoin always existed, BIP 75 has the potential to streamline this process.\n\nDuring his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Todd made it clear that he’s more concerned with senders of bitcoins identifying themselves than the recipients of those funds. “The part of BIP 75 that\'s about determining who you\'re sending money to isn\'t objectionable, just the idea of trying to figure out who is actually sending the funds,” he stated.\n\nThose who disagree with Todd would point out that BIP 75 is a completely opt-in protocol. To this point, Todd responded, “Blacklists can also be implemented in an ‘opt-in’ way; that doesn\'t mean we should support the concept.”\n\nBIP 75 Author Responds\n\nBitcoin Magazine also reached out to one of the authors of BIP 75, Netki CEO Justin Newton. One of the first things Newton was able to clarify was that the personally-identifying information sent in the payment protocol can be seen only by the sender and receiver involved in a particular transaction.\n\n“We actually added another layer of encryption (at the application layer) as a way to protect against the data being man-in-the-middled,” said Newton.\n\nAccording to Newton, a BIP 75 user does not even have to trust his or her own phone or laptop to keep payment info private when a hardware wallet is used.\n\nNewton also shares similar concerns to Todd and others in terms of a potential slippery slope toward AML and KYC compliance on the vast majority (if not all) of Bitcoin transactions.\n\n“I actually share their concern, but it led me to a different conclusion,” said Newton. “My view was that AML and KYC compliance is going to be required if we want to get to the mass market and we need to ensure it is done in a way that fundamentally protects fungibility, privacy and the open, permissionless nature of Bitcoin. In the absence of a standard that encourages those values, we will end up with hidden systems that do exactly the same thing, but without taking the concerns of the community into account.”\n\nJudging from a Reddit comment by Breadwallet CEO, the wallet maker is not interested in BIP 75 for regulatory compliance reasons. Instead, Breadwallet is mostly interested in the proposal for reasons related to the user-friendliness (or lack thereof) of Bitcoin wallets. BIP 75 enables useful features that are found in more mainstream payment applications (think Venmo) such as human-readable transaction logs and address books. It’s also possible for users to manually track their transaction history on their own, but BIP 75 greatly simplifies the process.\n\nSo, Is BIP 75 a Worrisome Proposal?\n\nThe BIP 75 debate ties in with many of the other Bitcoin debates that have taken place over the years. Does the community want privacy and security or easy-to-use wallets? Is it worth abandoning some of the early principles of the network in order to seek mass adoption?\n\nIn this case, it appears that not much of a trade-off is being made by individuals who wish to use BIP 75-enabled wallets. All of their personal information is end-to-end encrypted and they aren’t likely giving up much (if any) information that wouldn’t already be known by the recipient of a transaction. Also, it’s important to remember that this is a layer-2, opt-in protocol.\n\nHaving said that, it’s always important for the Bitcoin community to remain vigilant against attempts to apply traditional financial regulations to the Bitcoin blockchain. After all, Bitcoin’s core value proposition is the ability to transfer value across the internet in a censorship-resistant manner. The people who need Bitcoin as a payment system are those who would normally be blocked from other, traditional systems such as PayPal or credit cards.\n\nIt appears that BIP 75 is not a huge move in the wrong direction, but all Bitcoin users should refrain from attaching identifying information to their transactions as often as possible. In addition to that, it wouldn’t hurt to focus on the real problem, which is the need for enhanced privacy features.\n\nResponding to the concerns, Breadwallet Director of Product Management James MacWhyte told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n""BIP75 puts users in total control of how much information they share and who they share it with. Some people may not realize that you will always be able to choose to share no information and remain anonymous. It is a huge improvement in privacy, and an essential building block in making Bitcoin more accessible and powerful.\n\n""Avoiding address reuse is important for maintaining privacy and security, yet having to manually send a new address every time you want to receive money is cumbersome and inconvenient. We wanted to automate that process, but if your wallet gave out an address to anyone who asked your privacy would not be protected. That’s why we designed BIP75, which will allow us to automatically give out payment addresses only to the people you trust. It is a huge improvement in privacy, and an essential building block in making Bitcoin more accessible and powerful.', 'A Secret Service agent who stole money seized by the government in the investigation of underground drug bazaar Silk Road is now suspected of stealing money in at least two other cases, according to court filings unsealed on Thursday.\n\nIn the larger of those cases, he is thought to have been behind the theft of about $700,000 worth of Bitcoin from a Secret Service account three months after the agency was urged to block his access, the documents say.\n\nFormer agent Shaun Bridges pleaded guilty last year and was sentenced in December to nearly six years in prison for stealing more than $800,000 of the crypto currency Bitcoin during the Silk Road investigation.\n\nAccording to an affidavit unsealed Thursday, the Justice Department learned in April 2015 that Bridges might have kept a private cryptographic key giving him access to a Bitcoin wallet with the $700,000 in currency that the Silk Road task force had seized in 2014. The department urged the agency to move the funds elsewhere.\n\n“Unfortunately, the U.S. Secret Service did not do so and the funds were thereafter stolen, something the U.S, Secret Service only discovered once it was ordered by a court to pay a portion of the seizure back to affected claimants,” a team of prosecutors wrote in an accompanying motion. The Bitcoin in question was moved in July 2015 but only discovered missing in December, the affidavit said.\n\nThe Secret Service and Bridges’ attorney Steven Levin declined to comment.\n\nIn the previous case, Bridges admitted he stole money from Silk Road accounts and framed someone else for it, leading Silk Road chief Ross Ulbricht to plan a murder. Ulbricht is now serving a life sentence.\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)']"
