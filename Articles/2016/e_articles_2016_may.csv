05/01/2016,"[""During the past week, followers of the Bitcoin landscape noticed an error on the Bitcoin blockchain, where one user sent 291 BTC ($136,700) to a Bitcoin mining pool by accident.\n\nTo understand what happened, users unfamiliar with how Bitcoin works need a simple intro. Whenever user A sends Bitcoin to user B, the transaction needs to be recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain, a shared unhackable database.\n\nUsers send this transaction to Bitcoin mining pools, which, for a fee, record and carry out the transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain. For each transaction, the fee is generally 0.0001 Bitcoin.\n\nSomebody mixed up their form fields\n\nAs it appears from the details of transaction #409,008, one user accidentally switched the two fields and sent 0.0001 Bitcoin to the recipient and 291.241 Bitcoin to the mining pool instead.\n\nAll Bitcoin transactions these days are carried out via automated tools, so it appears that whoever made this transaction was using older tools, such as command-line clients or some antique desktop client.\n\nSince Bitcoin is a crypto-currency that ensures users get to keep their privacy, nobody knows who sent the money or for whom was it intended.\n\nThe mining pool is willing to return the Bitcoin\n\nWhat's known is that the lucky mining pool that received the generous amount is BitClub, who, according to its terms of service, is legally allowed to keep it.\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin news site CoinDesk says BitClub is willing to return the money to its rightful owner if they decide to come forward and prove their real identity.\n\nFurthermore, the mining pool has said that if the user does not reveal themselves within a week, meaning until May 3, they will donate some of the fees to the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nBitcoin experts claim that is very unlikely that anyone will come forward since most people who use Bitcoin do it for privacy, and they'll likely draw the attention of local authorities if it was to be revealed they attempted to move such large funds via Bitcoin instead of local banks.\n\nit appears some idiot sent 0.0001 BTC with a 291.241 BTC miner fee instead of the other way around. RIP bags. https://t.co/8rb1VY1e3g — ActualAdvice_BTC (@ActualAdviceBTC) April 26, 2016"", ""Bitcoin and banks can work together, according to PrivatBank’s Alexander Vityaz, who sees card companies and cryptocurrency focusing on the technology aspect of transactions, while banks focus on brokerage.\n\nBanks have had a tense relationship with cryptocurrency, from fighting Bitcoin to trying to patent blockchain technology for their own use.\n\nHowever, Alexander Vityaz, Corezoid Founder and PrivatBank’s head of ecommerce, sees Bitcoin and card companies such as VISA and MasterCard working together with banks, taking on separate roles instead of competing for the same position.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke with Alexander Vityaz about banking’s shifting relationship with both card providers and Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is not a competitor for VISA\n\nCoinTelegraph: Banks dealing directly with Bitcoin seems to be a rare occurrence. Is that an accurate sentiment?\n\nAlexander Vityaz: Yes, that is correct - because of compliance, KYC, AML. PrivatBank doesn't work with Bitcoin directly. We use blockchain technology (Bitcoin digital signature - public and private keys) to sign financial documents, transactions, and even for encrypting traffic in mobile app.\n\nCT: What prompted PrivatBank to be different in that regard?\n\nAV: What prompted us? We wanted to spearhead this movement. Curiosity prompted us. We always wanted to be #1. For example, the first p2p card to card transaction we did in 2003 (!) in partnership with Visa.\n\nCT: Many in the cryptocurrency community think that Bitcoin and blockchain technology will be the end of banks as we know them today. Do you share that sentiment?\n\nAV: In brief, we don't share this sentiment. These two technologies will coexist. Banks will become credit brokers, and Visa will deeply learn how to use Bitcoin and blockchain.\n\nAs I’ve said before, Bitcoin is not a competitor for VISA, as VISA now isn’t the same as VISA back when PayPal emerged. It will research, integrate, and keep its finger on the pulse. In fact, it will most likely be a kind of co-evolution rather than confrontation.”\n\nRole of banks will diminish\n\nCT: The use of cryptocurrency allows many of the unbanked to receive the same benefits as using a bank, without the cost or difficult setup. Do you think that would reduce the role of banking for the everyday citizen? Or would it have no serious effect? Or, will the role of traditional banks diminish, but for a different reason?\n\nAV: We will not have a situation: “either Bitcoin or banking.” It'll be “both.” The role of banks as technology companies will diminish, they will concentrate on money brokerage - as they were doing this hundreds years ago.\n\nBitcoin as it is today is rather hard for common citizens to use. Plastic card is much more simple product. What will really happen is that banking functions (from the point of view of technology) will gravitate away from banks towards global payment systems, such as Visa, MasterCard and towards Bitcoin technology.\n\nAs I’ve said: “Theoretically, defragmentation of a super-fragmented system (there are 30,000 banks in the world) is possible with two systems only, vertical or horizontal, namely payment systems or Bitcoin respectively.”\n\nBeing decentralized Bitcoin irritates a lot of banks\n\nCT: Do you see any banks unwilling to accept this new, more limited role in the world financial system?\n\nAV: All the banks are not willing to accept this. But it's temporary, because they don't understand what's going on. As soon as they realize that they don't have to become IT-companies, banks will accept their new role.\n\nBitcoin irritates a lot of banks, because it's decentralized. They don't know how to manage it, because banks are not IT-companies, and can't become IT-companies.\n\nVisa and MasterCard have good chances to become IT-companies, because they were born as global companies. Banks will get tools for working with Bitcoin from Visa, MasterCard.\n\nClassic money will adapt features from cryptocurrencies\n\nCT: Now, central banks, I'm sure, may take a different view, at least in regards to Bitcoin, since it provides a currency they cannot control or inflate. Do you see many banks following this skepticism towards a currency that is not directly government-controlled?\n\nAV: Banks want to get from Visa and MasterCard products of the same level of readiness as plastic cards. They don’t want to get APIs only. Banks do not individually re-invent plastic cards. They sell absolutely standard Visa and MasterCard cards.\n\nAs a set of ready-made processes you can imagine not only Bitcoin-enabled tools, but also P2P money transfer, Internet banking, e-commerce tools. Internet banks need to become the same standard product, such as a Visa or MasterCard card. Bitcoin doesn't replace anything. It's a complementary currency.\n\nFrom my interview in Forklog: “I think cryptocurrencies may supersede minor currencies, or even become a basis for the financial system in countries like North Korea. It’s the only chance to bypass the banking system with its obstacles and reach the world for such totally enclosed nations.\n\nAs for ‘mature’ currencies, it will be more a case of hybridization rather than superseding. Classic money will adapt useful features from cryptocurrencies and use Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Transfer of cash issuance onto altchain is quite likely for some countries.”"", ""When The Pirate Bay and other torrent sites started accepting Bitcoin donations a few years ago, copyright holders voiced concerns about this new 'unseizable' revenue stream. Thus far, this fear seems unwarranted with TPB raking in an average of $9 per day in Bitcoin donations over the past year. While hardly a windfall, it's a fortune compared to the donations received by the leading torrent site KickassTorrents.\n\nThree years ago many popular torrent sites added an option to donate via Bitcoin. The Pirate Bay was one of the first to jump on board, a development which caused concern among copyright holders.\n\nThe RIAA even informed the U.S. trade representative about this looming threat. The music industry group warned that Bitcoin could make it harder to crack down on pirate sites.\n\n“In April 2013, the site started accepting donations from the public by Bitcoin, a digital currency, which operates using peer-to-peer technology,” the RIAA wrote.\n\n“There are no central authority or banks involved which makes it very difficult to seize or trace Bitcoin funds,” the music industry group added.\n\nBitcoin does indeed make it harder to seize funds, as law enforcement would need access to the computer where the wallet is kept.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin also makes it easy to see how much donations are coming in. All transactions are public and traceable which allows anyone to see how much money Pirate Bay is making through donations.\n\nThis is exactly what we decided to do. Using the publicly listed Bitcoin wallet address, which is shown on every Pirate Bay page we found that 376 donations, roughly one donation per day, were sent over the past year.\n\nThe total amount of Bitcoin received during this period adds up to 8.21 BTC. At the current exchange rate this equals $3,500 in donations over the past twelve months, or $9.34 per day.\n\nNeedless to say, Pirate Bay’s operators are not getting rich off user donations.\n\nTPB featuring the Bitcoin address\n\n\n\nIt appears that the interest in donating has tapered off over the years. Last year Custos Media Technologies reported that the site had received 126.64 Bitcoin in its various wallets between 2013 and 2015, which is significantly more.\n\nTPB Bitcoin earnings from 2013 till 2015\n\n\n\nThat being said, even the 8.21 it received last year is a fortune when compared to other prominent torrent sites.\n\nExtraTorrent also lists a Bitcoin address on its site, as well as in the uploads of their ETTV and ETRG release groups. This wallet amassed a total of 4.31 in donations since 2013 which is roughly $1 per day.\n\nAgain, that’s quite a treasure trove when we look at the donations that are coming in at KickassTorrents, which is currently the most-visited torrent site.\n\nSince 2013 KAT has raked in a measly 0.96 BTC, which is roughly $250, or two dozen cents per day. Admittedly, KAT doesn’t promote donations and the address is only listed in the site’s FAQ.\n\nIt’s pretty safe to say that if the RIAA and other copyright holders are concerned about the revenue going to pirate sites and groups, there’s little to worry about in respect of Bitcoin or user donations in general."", 'The human animal prefers to live in an unchanged environment. Fear of change is an instinct in every species. For good reason. The salient factor about yesterday, in the world outside civilization where in earlier millennia human instinct was created, is that today\'s creatures survived it. The instinctive moral is, make today as much like yesterday as possible, survive again. Repeat.\n\nAnd this instinct, translated into the world of finance, is a fundamental tenant of investment - the greater the uncertainty of a project or investment, the greater must be its expected payoff.\n\nFinancial innovation, when it becomes an important factor in determining the future financial landscape, inevitably requires management of the normal human aversion to change. But will the innovators account for the threat they present, and defuse the fear they inspire? Or will they instead see the fear they inspire as reason to assume an adversarial posture?\n\nAs I watch the unfolding story of two developments in financial technology, the new transactions technology associated with IEX (Private) - a putative exchange that seeks, through technological change, to redress the balance between the interests of the buy side and the sell side of the market for investments; and Bitcoin - a crypto-currency that represents a new approach to the management of transfer of property rights; it seems to me that the advocates of both are not sufficiently focused on the angst they are inevitably producing. As a result, they are not managing their need to address the threat that they inevitably pose to the vast majority who are naturally averse to the dramatic change that they represent.\n\nAnd how will the institutions, big and small, that inhabit the financial landscape manage these new factors in financial evolution? Conventional wisdom is that the large institutions such as the dealer banks: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Barclays (NYSE:BCS), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM); the large exchange management firms, Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) and CME Group (NASDAQ:CME); and the large IT firms, IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG); will be too slow-of-foot and too invested in the old technologies to compete. They will, according to this school of thought, cede the field to the many start-ups, known as fintech firms, that are receiving the attention of investors looking for a quick kill.\n\nMy preliminary assessment is that three financial institutions, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan, are doing the best job of fighting off their institutional inertia among the bigs. If they succeed, these banks will thrive in the next five years as the two technologies transform finance. IBM has recently entered the fray, with success that remains to be seen. Their press release shows an excellent command of the issues a firm like IBM will face, but the company is sitting on the fence and has not committed to a strategy yet.\n\nAnd how will governments manage the financial system vulnerabilities implicit in these new technologies? In both technologies, the globe would better manage the angst the two technologies are about to create if Xanax, or possibly medicinal marijuana, were administered every weekday morning to federal regulatory executives for the next few years.\n\nBecause nothing short of hell or high water is going to stop either IEX or Bitcoin from transforming our financial system. And this will make regulation of the global financial system, as well as working for financial institutions, stressful. Yet for those of us who use the markets indirectly, investors, the result is going to be a more efficient, cheaper world.\n\nIn the early going, it appears that London will play its traditional role of entrepreneurial regulatory risk-taker. This role has served it well - notably in the rise of the Eurodollar and foreign currency markets - keeping it in the running with New York City in the competition for financial capital of the world. In the case of Bitcoin, London is actively supporting a sally into Bitcoin transactions, a joint venture between Barclays and Circle (a Boston-based fintech start-up). This is the first real retail commercial venture by a financial institution into this technology.\n\nWe have yet to learn, however, to what degree this is a ""show pony,"" or a ""plow horse."" Is it a real commercial venture with a real exposure to the risks inherent in the technology? The answer will depend on whether the transactions involve a bank account at Barclays (show pony) or a transfer through the joint venture party in real-time without a bid-ask spread (plow horse).\n\nAvoiding Moral Detours on the Tech Highway. A very important factor in the success of these new technologies will inevitably be the success of its managers in addressing the fear of the unknown that the technologies inspire. I am concerned that both the managers of the two technologies have fallen into a trap that things new and important should earnestly avoid. The trap is the tendency of forces behind change to allow moral content to seep into what is essentially a technological dialog. Both technologies are sliding into this trap. IEX is mistakenly portraying itself as ""good."" Bitcoin is portraying itself as a ""renegade.""\n\nIEX is too good for its own good. Brad Katsuyama allowed himself to be lionized by Michael Lewis in Lewis\' book Flash Boys. Katsuyama should have run, not walked, from the notoriety created by Lewis\' book. He was associated by Lewis with the word ""rigged"" in describing the clone exchanges: NYSE, BATS, (BATS) and Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ). The word ""rigged"" became the focus of a famous CNBC interview - an interview that side-tracked the career of BATS President Michael O\'Brien for his defense of high frequency trading (HFT). That event, and the enmity it created, has made the human element important going forward, and will cost IEX money and time.\n\nThe Lewis book and interview forced SEC Chair Mary Jo White to reject the word ""rigged"" publicly. And for good reason. The clone exchanges are not rigged. What they do is legal and in the public domain. This SEC denial will also have a cost to IEX. While portraying IEX in a moral light will sell books, it will retard the inevitable changes that the nascent would-be exchange will ultimately bring.\n\nIEX is renowned for introducing the ""speed bump,"" a coil of fiber optic cable that slows inbound orders by 350 microseconds. The purpose of the speed bump is to prevent high frequency traders, the darlings of the clone exchanges, from front-running or otherwise using the advantage of their knowledge of orders in advance of the SEC-blessed broadcast of the Securities Information Processor (or SIP), the technology used to collect quote and trade data from different exchanges, collate and consolidate that data, and continuously disseminate real-time price quotes and trades for all stocks.\n\nThe SIP calculates the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) for all stocks, but because of the sheer volume of data it handles, has a finite latency period. (Latency is the difference between the speed of light and the speed of an order feed like SIP.) IEX\'s speed bump allows SIP to catch up to the faster orders of high frequency traders (HFT) who outrace SIP by paying the clone exchanges for a head start. The speed bump, in theory, gives traders that have not paid an exchange for a speed advantage an equal opportunity to access the orders SIP displays.\n\nThat\'s why, out of the dozens of exchanges in the world, only one - IEX - is not a clone of the others. At the moment, the world sees IEX as a one-trick pony, the designer of the speed bump. But IEX is better understood as a group of very bright people who are going to develop many new technologies that improve the efficiency of trading. The question is, will IEX have the wisdom to minimize their opposition by not vilifying their opponents? If they don\'t see the need for cooperation and even support from the powers that be, the job of changing the financial landscape will be slower and more difficult.\n\nThis makes the endorsement of the IEX by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase an important positive development and a sign that IEX\'s management ""gets it"" now.\n\nBitcoin is too bad for its own good. Bitcoin\'s future is also hampered by a moral posture - its renegade image. In the case of Bitcoin, users run from the fact that blockchain, the technology that drives the genius of Bitcoin, is an attractive technology for illegal transactions. They ""bait and switch"" blockchain\'s bad rap to the crypto-currency, Bitcoin, going so far as to change the store of value that drives the economics of blockchain technology from Bitcoin to others to escape Bitcoin\'s stigma. One example alternative to Bitcoin that is fashionable is Ethereum. But it is blockchain itself, the technology, that makes anonymity inexpensive. Furthermore, this anonymity is fundamental to blockchain\'s value in transactions technology. One cannot hide from the very function of an innovation.\n\nHow Bitcoin works\n\nThe genius of Bitcoin is the use of the computer power, the basic weapon of hackers, against these same hackers, reversing the role of computer power in offence and defense of security. One effect of this inspiration is that it is nearly impossible to identify the payer and receiver in any transaction, if anonymity is a trader\'s objective. Anonymity is itself desirable - indeed often essential - in financial transactions. In securities markets, traders spend billions achieving anonymity, since knowledge of trader identity has a major negative impact on the price of a large trade. In Bitcoin, anonymity is all but costless. And blockchain tech made the cost of hacking blockchain prohibitive. This is the factor that makes the adoption of blockchain in finance inevitable. Any informed observer of the security of financial data has seen that security has become an IT arms race that will eventually fall under the weight of the prohibitive cost of firewalls and other forms of protection.\n\nBut the earliest important commercial uses of Bitcoin tended to be illegal transactions. Bitcoin became, very visibly, the store of value for payments for the drug and weapons transfer site, Silk Road, that was eventually closed by law enforcement.\n\nAnd that is why, when an established market participant: governments, major financial institutions such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, and major IT firms such as IBM enter the world of Bitcoin, the tendency is to call it blockchain. The pariah, Blockchain, goes unmentioned.\n\nThis is an immature reaction. It ignores a fundamental aspect of the blockchain technology. For computer power to provide the transactions security that blockchain promises, the larger the number of transactions the system processes per unit of time, the more secure it becomes. And adding new crypto-currencies only weakens the system\'s security. And with no payoff. Because the currency is not the reason blockchain is useful to illegal users. It is the blockchain methodology itself. Illegal users will happily move to Etherium if that crypto-currency becomes more secure.\n\nIt was a positive sign in the UK that the first commercial application acknowledged the inevitability of Bitcoin. In a later article, we will address Bitcoin paranoia and argue that the big firms should drop the effort to hide from it.', 'The Isle of Man’s Gambling Supervision Commission (GSC) and Treasury have approved changes to the island’s gambling regulation that allow virtual currencies like Bitcoin to be accepted as cash, according to a report from the GSC’s Mark Rutherford, deputy chief executive.\n\nThe regulation, called the Gambling Regulation Package 2016, includes other changes, such as expanding voluntary gambling controls that an operator can offer players.\n\nThe suggested changes remain subject to approval by government drafters, the report noted, although any deviations will be in wording rather than intent.\n\nCryptocurrencies Are Property\n\nThe regulation classifies cryptocurrencies as property rather than currency.\n\nAn operator will be able to accept virtual currencies subject to regulatory safeguards on the safety of the way value is stored and on the protection of value. The GSC also requires an operator’s cryptocurrency exchange to have a reporting requirement to a creditable financial intelligence unit.\n\nLicensees will be allowed to open accounts for players who use convertible virtual currencies. A money deposit is required to open an account using a credit card, debit card or other means the commissioners approve.\n\nGSC has proposed including a change in the phrase “deposit of money” to include the words: “a deposit of money or the deposit of something which has a value in money or money’s worth” where the format of the money’s worth still requires the GSC’s approval.\n\nSublicensee Rights Clarified\n\nAnother change in the regulation is to clarify that sub-licensees can use all parts of a full licensee’s platform.\n\nOne function of gambling companies is to capture and process payment details, categorize AML/CFT risk and capture data for purposes of commercial marketing. The non-gaming functions are known as the “back office” and often are more extensive than the games they support.\n\nAn island-based CSP has approached the GSC to license a model whereby a licensee supplies a back office to entrepreneurs seeking to concentrate on games and marketing exclusively. The GSC supports the proposed model but observes that the law originally only anticipated games being supplied.\n\nThe model is designed for smaller start-up operations by leveraging the sub-license model, in which the yearly OGRA fee is reduced by £30,000 to £5,000 in exchange for the sub-licensee creating an exclusive partnership with the full licensee.\n\nThe law is currently framed so that it can be interpreted to exclude the use of any parts of a full licensee’s platform except for specific games. The GSC wants to broaden the services a full licensee can offer a sublicensee. Full licensees will be able to offer added, non-licensable services as they see fit.\n\nTest Certificates Addressed\n\nAnother change is that the GSC will list jurisdictions and transactional organizations from whom it will recognize test certificates as equal to those of the Isle of Man. Approved testing laboratories that simulate play and ensure payouts and randomness verify the fairness of games offered to the public online. The test lab issues a certificate to the regulator.\n\nThe standards required to obtain a certificate vary widely among jurisdictions. The regulation establishes restrictions for accepting test certificates. It has the effect of making it hard to accept certificates issued to other territories’ gambling authorities.\n\nThe GSC wishes to accept certificates from approved testing laboratories in regard to non-Isle of Man standards or of any transactional standards that emerge, including those the IAGR multi-jurisdictional testing framework cites.\n\nThe legislative drafter that lists the acceptable test standards can administratively maintain certification of the system for gaming and lotteries.\n\nAlso read: Report: How the Isle of Man became ‘BTC Island’\n\nOther Changes\n\nAnother change is the creation of a wider choice of controls for gamblers. Operators make functions available with specific options for setting maximum bets or stakes. A player is not permitted to increase any such maximum except after seven days’ notice.\n\nBet and stake limits are not often used by players, and the controls are problematic in some ways.\n\nA proposed change allows a more effective functionality.\n\nAnother aspect of the change addresses the clarification on the protection of winnings.\n\nStill another addresses the ability to offset unused amounts of license fees when upgrading and downgrading license types.\n\nBitcoin has become well established as a currency for daily transactions on the Isle of Man, a U.K. dependency in the Irish Sea that aspires to be a global cryptocurrency leader, CCN has reported. The Isle of Man, known to some as “Bitcoin Island,” boasts a progressive government, outstanding technological expertise, and an exceptional Internet infrastructure.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The growing need for automated teller machines including Bitcoin ATMs in developing nations such as Nigeria, India, and Kenya is propelling the growth of the global ATM market, says Technavio’s latest global ATM market report.\n\nEmerging trends\n\nThe research highlights three key emerging trends predicted to impact market growth through 2020.\n\nAside investments in bitcoin ATMs by entrepreneurs, the research study also identifies deployment of ATM machines in off-site terminals and advances in technology emerging trends expected to propel the growth\n\nof the global ATM market.\n\nAccording to coinatmradar.com, which collates the location of bitcoin ATMs all over the world, there are presently 639 bitcoin ATMs in different parts of the world.\n\nThis is almost a 200% increase in the number reported by the same website in 2014 when it showed there were 211 Bitcoin ATMs operating on six continents.\n\nGovernment initiatives for disbursing benefits, including food stamps, through electronic machines to reduce costs are driving ATM installations and this enables beneficiaries to access deposit accounts with the help of cards that work at ATMs and POS terminals.\n\nGovernment initiatives\n\nAfrica launched its first bitcoin ATM in 2014 when Lamassu’s machine hit Johannesburg in South Africa.

It is not the first time a disruptive idea gets a lot of backlash before it is eventually embraced by the masses, indicating plausible survival chances for Bitcoin and its growth. Nikola Tesla and his alternating current concept share a lot of similarities with Bitcoin in this regard.\n\nThe Battle For Bitcoin Supremacy Is Long And Hard\n\nLooking at things from a historical perspective, there has been a lot of opposition when it comes to innovation and disruption. One of the most prominent examples is Nikola Tesla and his idea of providing alternating current to the world. Despite a lot of industry experts dismissing Tesla’s idea of AC, he decided to pursue this avenue of providing an alternative system to the world.\n\nHowever, that process was not an easy one either, as people who have made a name for themselves in one particular industry will not give up that power so easily. Nor should they, to be fair, but that does not mean new ideas and concepts should be dismissed right away. Collaboration is far more beneficial than sticking to a particular way of doing things, especially when the inevitable disruption is staring one in the face.\n\nEven though Tesla had a valid idea that worked perfectly fine, Edison did not take too kindly to the idea of relinquishing power. In fact, Tesla’s alternative currency development provided the world with a voltage that could be scaled upwards or downwards on demand. However, a negative media campaign was created to discredit these ideas, which eventually did not pan out well for Edison. Once people saw the magic of how AC worked, they were sold on the idea, and demand started to increase exponentially.\n\nThe same principle applies to Bitcoin, which is also proposing a working and viable alternative to traditional finance. However, the powers that be in the financial world will not give up their stranglehold on the world’s economy anytime soon. Plus, the media likes to discredit Bitcoin at every turn possible, even though far fewer people are giving these outlets credit for their laughable attempts.\n\nOnce people see the magic of Bitcoin as a currency and money transfer protocol, they will be hooked. Established financial players are doing what they can to distinguish between Bitcoin and the blockchain these days. However, there is no denying Bitcoin has a bright future ahead, although it will take some time until people get around to embracing this concept. Financial freedom is a very strange – and perhaps unattainable – idea for most consumers and enterprises, but they would be surprised what Bitcoin is capable of.\n\nSource: Venturebeat\n\nImage Courtesy of NewsBTC All Rights Reserved', 'The rate of stories ending “now accepts bitcoin” has slowed down from the pace it was at a couple years ago, but this one’s a big one.

05/02/2016,"['Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright says he is Mr Bitcoin\n\nAustralian entrepreneur Craig Wright has publicly identified himself as Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nHis admission follows years of speculation about who came up with the original ideas underlying the digital cash system.\n\nMr Wright has provided technical proof to back up his claim using coins known to be owned by Bitcoin\'s creator.\n\nProminent members of the Bitcoin community and its core development team say they have confirmed his claims.\n\nBut many others in the Bitcoin world are asking for more proof.\n\nSigned blocks\n\nMr Wright has revealed his identity to three media organisations - the BBC, the Economist and GQ.\n\nAt the meeting with the BBC, Mr Wright digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys created during the early days of Bitcoin\'s development. The keys are inextricably linked to blocks of bitcoins known to have been created or ""mined"" by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nImage copyright AP Image caption Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto was wrongly identified as the inventor of Bitcoin in 2014\n\n""These are the blocks used to send 10 bitcoins to Hal Finney in January [2009] as the first bitcoin transaction,"" said Mr Wright during his demonstration.\n\nRenowned cryptographer Hal Finney was one of the engineers who helped turn Mr Wright\'s ideas into the Bitcoin protocol, he said.\n\n""I was the main part of it, but other people helped me,"" he said.\n\nSoon after Mr Wright went public, Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, published a blog backing his claim.\n\n""I believe Craig Steven Wright is the person who invented Bitcoin,"" he wrote.\n\nJon Matonis, an economist and one of the founding directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, said he was convinced that Mr Wright was who he claimed to be.\n\n""During the London proof sessions, I had the opportunity to review the relevant data along three distinct lines: cryptographic, social, and technical,"" he said.\n\n""It is my firm belief that Craig Wright satisfies all three categories.""\n\nMr Wright said he planned to release information that would allow others to cryptographically verify that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nNot everyone has been convinced by Mr Wright\'s claims and the technical proof he put in his blog. Some cryptographers and developers who worked through the information provided said they had trouble getting verifiable information out of it.\n\nSecurity expert Dan Kaminsky said the procedure was almost ""maliciously resistant"" to validation.\n\nMany people have called on Mr Wright to go further in proving his identify.\n\nHow Bitcoin works\n\nBitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.\n\nBut it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes.\n\nHowever, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for.\n\nTo process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.\n\nFor each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins.\n\nImage copyright Eyewire Image caption Verifying bitcoin transactions takes a lot of computer power\n\nThis provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems.\n\nTo compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day.\n\nThere are currently about 15 million Bitcoins in existence.\n\nTo receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent.\n\nSince there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction.\n\nThese addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings.\n\nThey operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned.\n\n\'I want to work\'\n\nBy going public, Mr Wright hopes to put an end to press speculation about the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. The New Yorker, Fast Company, Newsweek and many other media organisations have all conducted long investigations seeking Bitcoin\'s creator and named many different people as candidates.\n\nIn December 2015, two magazines, Wired and Gizmodo, named Mr Wright as a candidate after receiving documents believed to be stolen from him that revealed his involvement with the project.\n\nSoon after these stories were published, authorities in Australia raided the home of Mr Wright. The Australian Taxation Office said the raid was linked to a long-running investigation into tax payments rather than Bitcoin.\n\nQuestioned about this raid, Mr Wright said he was cooperating fully with the ATO.\n\n""We have lawyers negotiating with them over how much I have to pay,"" he said.\n\nThe stories in December have led to many more journalists and others pursuing him and people he knows, he said.\n\n""There are lots of stories out there that have been made up and I don\'t like it hurting those people I care about,"" he said. ""I don\'t want any of them to be impacted by this.""\n\nImage copyright Valve Software Image caption Game network Steam is one of many sites that now accept Bitcoins as payment\n\n""I have not done this because it is what I wanted. It\'s not because of my choice,"" he said, adding that he had no plans to become the figurehead for bitcoins.\n\n""I really do not want to be the public face of anything,"" he said, expressing regret that he had been forced to reveal his identity.\n\n""I would rather not do it,"" he said. ""I want to work, I want to keep doing what I want to do. I don\'t want money. I don\'t want fame. I don\'t want adoration. I just want to be left alone.""\n\nBitcoins are now accepted as payment for a vast variety of goods and services - everything from international money transfers to ransoms for data encrypted by computer viruses. There are currently about 15.5 million bitcoins in circulation. Each one is worth about $449 (£306).\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is believed to have amassed about one million Bitcoins which would give him a net worth, if all were converted to cash, of about $450m.\n\n5 May 2016: Clarification\n\nThe original headline and text of this story was changed on the day of publication (2 May 2016).\n\nThe headline ""Bitcoin creator reveals his identity"" was amended to read ""Australian Craig Wright claims to be Bitcoin creator"".\n\nThe text of the article was also changed to recognise there was still doubt about Craig Wright\'s claim.', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - As a debate raged across the internet Monday over whether the mysterious founder of the bitcoin digital currency had finally been identified, executives at a major bitcoin conference in New York had a simple message: we’ve moved on.\n\nThat’s because bitcoin, the digital currency, has largely been supplanted by blockchain, the technology that underlies it, as the main interest of investors, technology companies and financial institutions.\n\n“If there is a 100 percent opportunity in the blockchain, bitcoin, or the currency, is only 1 percent of it,” said Jerry Cuomo, vice president, Blockchain Technologies at International Business Machines Corp. “So there is a whole 99 percent that has broad applications across the broad industries.”\n\nOver the past year numerous Wall Street firms, led by Goldman Sachs, have declared their commitment to pursuing blockchain as a potential revolutionary technology for tracking and clearing financial transactions.\n\nThe blockchain technology works by creating permanent, public “ledgers” of all transactions that could potentially replace complicated clearing and settlement systems with one simple ledger.\n\nStill, bitcoin is by far the largest implementation of blockchain technology and there is considerable debate as to whether one can truly develop without the other.\n\n“Bitcoin is still the only blockchain-enabled, cross-border large scale, provable application that’s actually in production,” said Joseph Guastella, a principal at Deloitte Consulting in New York. “Bitcoin as a currency may not be as relevant as it was in many ways, but it actually is relevant as a proof case for the blockchain technology.”\n\nBitcoins are created through a “mining” process, in which specialized computers solve complex math problems in exchange for bitcoins. One bitcoin is equivalent to $444.75 late on Monday and trade on various exchanges around the world.\n\nBut bitcoin transaction volume has been in decline over the past six months amid a bitter split over technical changes in the protocol that are needed to increase the capacity of the system that produces them. Because the cryptocurrency has no formal governance, it relies on a core group of developers for direction - and they are sharply divided over the changes.\n\nBut that debate was of relatively little concern to the Blockchain enthusiasts gathered in New York.\n\nAustralian tech entrepreneur Craig Wright identified himself on Monday as the creator of controversial digital currency bitcoin.\n\n“It’s irrelevant because his announcement doesn’t solve a problem or resolve a conflict,” said Bharat Solanki, managing director at Cambrian Consulting in New York.\n\n“It probably helps to determine the origins of bitcoin but only for recognition,” Solanki said.\n\nFor Naoki Taniguchi, a global innovation expert at The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd in San Francisco, he does not really care about who created bitcoin.\n\n“It’s all about the blockchain,” he said.', 'CME Group, which has looked for ways to strengthen its digital foothold since closing most of its trading pits last year, plans to start publishing bitcoin market prices in real time.\n\nThe Bitcoin Real Time Index is set to launch in the fourth quarter of this year. It will be based on global demand to buy and sell bitcoin and reflect the market price in U.S. dollars, CME said in a press release.\n\nCrypto Facilities, a London-based digital assets trading platform, will handle the calculations. CME will update the price about once every second, according to the release.\n\nCME also plans to publish a daily settlement price, called the Bitcoin Reference Rate. That will also be calculated in U.S. dollars and will be released each trade day at 4 p.m. London time, or 10 a.m. in Chicago.\n\n""These products are designed to allow bitcoin traders, companies and other users to rely on a credible reference rate price source,"" said Sandra Ro, executive director and digitization lead at CME Group, in the release.\n\nReference prices will be calculated based on pricing data from several bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms, including Coinbase, Bitstamp and Kraken.\n\nCME Group and Crypto Facilities plan to team up with Imperial College London to oversee the Bitcoin Reference Rate. They’ll develop a code of conduct for participants and make sure it maintains its integrity, according to the release.\n\nCME Group formed in 2007, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange merged with the Chicago Board of Trade. Its futures trading pits — once a lively environment full of floor traders shouting out prices of livestock and other commodities — faded when electronic trading was introduced in 1992.\n\nBy early 2015, CME Group’s open outcry futures had shrunk to 1 percent of its total futures volume. The company had shut down most of its trading pits by last summer and has been looking more toward a digital future with a startup-focused investment fund.\n\namarotti@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @allymarotti', '3:38\n\n\'The Shape of Water:\' The Creature Feature That Goes All the Way\n\nCan an audience suspend disbelief and believe that a human and a creature can fall in love; both emotionally and physically?

Long in development, Ludwin described the release as a formalization of the platform it has used on test projects for First Data, Nasdaq and Visa, among other partners.\n\nLudwin told CoinDesk:\n\n""What you’re seeing is really the first step of a bottom-up process that stands in contrast to the top-down approaches that have gotten a lot of attention the last several months. Chain OS 1 was not a committee-driven effort, a way to get everyone in the room and say \'Let\'s create a network\'.""\n\nWhile Ludwin didn’t name any competitors specifically, his comments allude to efforts like the Hyperledger project, an open-source blockchain initiative led by the Linux Foundation, and Corda, an in-development ledger platform being built by consortium R3CEV.\n\nLudwin suggested such processes are perhaps flawed in their approach to technology design, akin to trying to build a “rubber band ball” simply by shaking a box and hoping it turns into an elegant sphere\n\n""You create a core by tightly building the first things around a core, then it’s easy to add bands, and that’s what we’ve done with Chain Open Standard 1,"" Ludwin said.\n\nIn this way, Ludwin said he sees Chain OS 1 as a ""structure"", rather than a proposal, positioning the platform as one that should be considered by major institutions considering permissioned blockchain options in the market.\n\nThe announcements comes amid heightened competition from permissioned blockchain platform providers for high-profile projects.\n\nIn recent weeks, Barclays has unveiled a smart contracts template test built on Corda, while the DTCC has indicated it is working with Digital Asset Holdings on trials related to Hyperledger’s technology.\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nThroughout the interview, Ludwin sought to describe the project as one that has been some time in the making, providing an overview of the different steps the company has taken toward the creation of Chain OS 1.\n\nLudwin said, for example, that Chain recently held a private conference with its financial industry partners in New York, that included software demonstrations.\n\nThe scale and depth of the presentations, he contends, could have easily attracted news. However, he sought to frame Chain as a company that was not looking to attract attention except for more serious announcements.\n\n""People sneeze and say blockchain and it gets a press release,"" Ludwin said. ""This was arguably the biggest deepest blockchain event that happened and the reason that we didn’t do press was we wanted to create an environment that people can share things publicly, things that are very strategic.""\n\nLudwin said that Chain is seeking to launch a second partner conference in fall 2016 that will be open to further industry participation, and that the startup plans to hold similar events twice a year going forward.\n\n""All of the institutions that we bring into the fold over the next three to five months will get invited and be able to participate,"" he added.\n\nSpecification details\n\nIn prepared materials, Chain describes OS 1 as a “novel consensus model” that achieves finality in seconds, even for high-volume transactions.\n\nFurther, it boasts a ""privacy solution"" that encrypts blockchain data, providing what it called ""selective access"" to counterparties and regulators. Chain OS 1 is also equipped for Turing-complete smart contracts and virtual machines, two components perhaps most often associated with the open-source Ethereum blockchain project.\n\nElsewhere, it allows for participants to keep a full historical copy of the network’s distributed ledger, or a shortened version containing only the ""unspent state"", thereby lowering operational requirements.\n\nChain’s partners assert that this combination of features has the ingredients needed for enterprise institutions to build projects that could become commercial applications.\n\n""Chain’s protocol supports some of the most complex use cases we have in mind,"" Hu Liang, senior managing director at State Street, said in statements.\n\nNasdaq indicated it is using the platform for private market securities testing as well as for its proxy voting and clearing efforts.\n\nInnovation over incumbents\n\nGroup efforts aimed at permissioned blockchain development weren’t the only target for Ludwin’s critiques, however.\n\nIn remarks, Ludwin positioned Chain as the kind of ""Silicon Valley startup"" that financial institutions should want to partner with on blockchain efforts, as it doesn’t bring the kinds of complications and conflicts that can come with working with an established firm.\n\n""The bigger IT companies that are showing up, you want to ask, \'Are they trying to sell me something else?\' That’s always going to be a question,"" Ludwin said.\n\nThe comments come as a growing number of traditional IT firms, including Microsoft and IBM, seek to attract institutions to their various platforms and offerings.\n\nLudwin concluded:\n\n""The advantage of startups like Chain is we build exactly what we need.""\n\nNew York image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

05/03/2016,"['Billed as the future of democratized, digital money, the currency is now at the center of a conflict over how to develop technologies behind the system\n\nThe bitcoin world this week learned its absentee father might be Craig Wright, an Australian entrepreneur with nice suits and well-combed hair who claims he invented the digital currency.\n\nWright’s appearance complicates an already vicious custody battle. His claimed brainchild bitcoin – long billed as the future of democratized, digital money – is at the center of an ideological conflict over how to develop the technologies behind the system.\n\nAustralian Craig Wright claims he is bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto Read more\n\nBitcoin is a paperless, bank-less, state-less currency that allows people to pay directly for goods and services. The coins themselves are made by computers solving a set of complex math problems, and people who use their computers to make coins and record transactions are called miners.\n\nThe value of a bitcoin has fluctuated wildly since 2009 but now hovers between $400 and $450. To spend it, users buy bitcoin and transact using a third-party app such as Coinbase. Rather than a central authority validating transactions, all transfers are recorded on a public ledger. It can be used to pay for coffee, dinner or software from online stores as well as some real-world shops.\n\nFans of bitcoin say the system, which tends to be a pet project of encryption wonks, could eventually rival Visa. Yet transactions are already taking longer to clear – sometimes more than 40 minutes, which is a long time if you’re in a grocery store waiting for your payment to process. And without agreement on how to resolve the problems, it might soon become hard for anyone to use the service. So what’s causing the problem?\n\nNerds are calling each other “nerds” behind each other’s backs. It’s a “big communications breakdown”, according to Eric Lombrozo, chief technology officer of the bitcoin transaction firm Ciphrex. On the other side of the fence, Peter Smith, whose firm Blockchain tries to help people pay with bitcoin at places like local coffee shops, says “religion does perhaps explain it well”.\n\nIt’s unclear if Wright declaring himself to be bitcoin’s mythical creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, will help resolve that process. Wright is on the side of people like Blockchain’s Smith, a former financial services consultant whose firm raised more than $30m in venture capital, has offices in London and New York, and counts Virgin’s Sir Richard Branson as an investor.\n\n\n\nSmith won’t give his age, though his biography suggests he is in his early or mid-30s. He’s youthful, and his voice occasionally cracks when explaining the intricacies of virtual currency. On his Twitter page he describes himself as a “capitalist, explorer and coder”.\n\nNaturally, Smith wants bitcoin to grow quickly – preferably very quickly, handling lots of transactions at the same time so it’s faster and more convenient for users to spend money, and so that his investors make a bigger, faster return on their investment.\n\nAlong with other bitcoin companies, Smith is trying to improve the process to handle more consecutive transactions to reduce delays and boost volume. This isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Unlike Visa, bitcoin doesn’t have a central clearinghouse to process all transactions. Instead, each purchase and transfer is verified by one of thousands of computers on a volunteer network and bundled into a digital “block”. Each block of transactions is then recorded on a central ledger called the blockchain – the inspiration for the name of Smith’s firm.\n\nWho is Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto? Does it even matter? Read more\n\nBitcoin’s mainstream popularity has grown in fits and starts in recent years. For all its technological brilliance, there still isn’t an easy way to use it at major stores, and spending a coin can appear to be more trouble than it’s worth. For consumers, paying a merchant in person with bitcoin is similar to using PayPal or Venmo. They would need to open an app, pull up the store owner’s bitcoin address and than transfer the funds, which can take several minutes to clear.\n\nBig blocks, little blocks\n\nSmith, Wright and some other key bitcoin developers want the blocks to be larger so more transactions can clear at the same time. Their argument is both financial and philosophical. Sure, they could make more money, but bitcoin could also become more democratic and less a pet currency of techies.\n\nTo them, this is the whole point of the bitcoin project. On command, Smith can quote bitcoin’s originating documents like a supreme court justice combing over America’s founders’ early writings. An early email sent by Satoshi – or maybe Wright – spoke of Bitcoin becoming larger than Visa and relying on massive blocks.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fans of bitcoin say the system, which tends to be a pet project of encryption wonks, could eventually rival Visa. Photograph: Benoit Tessier/Reuters\n\nBut for the blocks to get bigger, the people who run the computers that make blocks – so-called Bitcoin “miners” – need to switch to a different software designed by the advocates of bigger blocks. And a lot of the miners aren’t prepared to switch, partly because some key Bitcoin developers have convinced miners that blocks for now should stay small.\n\nIf blocks become increasingly larger, miners will need more computing power to produce blocks, which means they’ll need more money for more computers. Eventually, they warn, only professional mining operations will be able to produce blocks of transactions.\n\nThis all cuts against one of the key premises of bitcoin – that the currency is decentralized and not influenced or controlled by a central bank or corporation like Visa. If bitcoin blocks get too large, it could become a system controlled by a few powerful groups of miners, the small blockers warn.\n\nYet there are also business interests at play. In 2014, before bitcoin’s current identity crisis, bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell and several encryption enthusiasts co-founded Blockstream, a bitcoin startup that tries to develop new ways to use the currency’s main technology, the blockchain. Banks and insurance companies, for instance, could automatically enforce contracts through their own, walled-off blockchains. They could also help add more capacity to the broader bitcoin network by adding more “side chains” to the system to help the main chain handle more blocks.\n\nIn short, Maxwell and his team have a business interest in blocks staying small, because more people would need side chains. To Smith, the big-block proponent, Blockstream’s position “does seem like a conflict of interest”.\n\nMaxwell and other Blockstream employees didn’t respond to interview requests. Rather, Blockstream president Adam Back referred the Guardian to Lombrozo, the co-founder of Ciphrex and a small-block proponent.Lombrozo countered that Blockstream is trying to improve the foundation of bitcoin in a more gradual and secure way.\n\nRather, he said consumer-facing bitcoin companies that help people spend the currency on everyday goods in popular stores are overeager to grow the currency too quickly to meet revenue targets.\n\nLombrozo said the group of developers in favor of keeping the small-block system want bitcoin’s foundation to improve before trying to grow it. “Everyone would like to see this expand and become very global,” he said.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, may have bigger problems. After White on Monday announced that he was the real Satoshi, security researchers and encryption experts began to question his public proof of his secret identity.', 'The Australian computer scientist Craig Wright’s claim to be the bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has been called into doubt by the discovery of a discrepancy in a central piece of his evidence.\n\nThe digital signature used to back up Wright’s claim was first uploaded to the internet seven years ago, something security researchers say means it cannot be used to prove his identity.\n\nWright uploaded the signature, starting “MEUCI … ”, as part of a blogpost intended to convince the bitcoin community that he was telling the truth when he claimed to be Nakamoto. But the community instead spotted that the signature had been uploaded once before, in a different format. When converted from base64 to hexadecimal, the new string of numbers and letters that begins “304502 …” can clearly be seen as the input to the very first bitcoin transaction. Far from being generated by Wright to prove his digital identity, the signature was created by Nakamoto in 2009 and has been publicly available ever since.\n\nWright says that the digital signature he posted is appended to the text of Jean-Paul Sartre’s refusal to accept the Nobel prize for literature. The Economist reports that he refused to sign any other document for any of the journalists he spoke to, something that the paper admitted raised flags. He has also not publicly signed anything with the private keys associated with any earlier bitcoins, particularly the “genesis block” (the first 50 bitcoins ever created), instead only using the key associated with the first bitcoin transaction, which came nine days later.\n\nSecurity researchers say that the discrepancy, combined with the absence of any other public technical evidence, suggests that Wright’s post is a “scam”. “That’s how Craig Wright tried to fool us,” writes security researcher Robert Graham. “Craig Wright magically appears to have proven he knows Satoshi’s private-key, when in fact he’s copied the inputs/outputs and made us think we calculated them. It would’ve worked, too, but there’s too many damn experts in the blockchain who immediately pick up on the subtle details.”\n\nDan Kaminsky, another security researcher, is equally damning.\n\n“Yes, this is a scam. Not maybe. Not possibly,” he says. “Wright is pretending he has Satoshi’s signature on Sartre’s writing. That would mean he has the private key, and is likely to be Satoshi. What he actually has is Satoshi’s signature on parts of the public Blockchain, which of course means he doesn’t need the private key and he doesn’t need to be Satoshi. He just needs to make you think Satoshi signed something else besides the Blockchain - such as Sartre. He doesn’t publish Sartre. He publishes 14% of one document. He then shows you a hash that’s supposed to summarise the entire document. This is a lie.”\n\nIn a carefully stage-managed announcement, three publications (the BBC, the Economist and GQ) had simultaneously published Wright’s claims to be Nakamoto on Monday, alongside a blogpost from Wright himself detailing the evidence he had provided to prove his claims.\n\nBut within hours, security researchers questioned the evidence Wright had made public, declaring his announcement a “scam”, “deception” and “the latest in an expanding list of falsehoods and fabrications”.\n\nEvery transaction made using bitcoin is public. It is also signed with the “private key” of the person sending the money – a long string of characters that acts as the password to the transaction. Some transactions, particularly those made very early in the history of bitcoin, were definitely made by Nakamoto, and so one way for Wright to prove that he is Nakamoto would be to digitally sign another piece of information with the same private key.\n\nThis is what Wright claimed to do, in a long, technical blogpost detailing the process by which one can sign and verify documents electronically. The end result of the post is a digital signature, signed by Nakamoto’s private key.\n\nThat seems to be the evidence by which Wright convinced three news outlets to publish his claims, under headlines: “Craig Wright revealed in Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto” (BBC), “Craig Wright reveals himself as Satoshi Nakamoto” (The Economist) and “Dr Craig Wright outs himself as bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto” (the BBC, though, subsequently changed its headline to “Australian Craig Wright claims to be Bitcoin creator”). However, experts claim the substitution in Wright’s evidence makes it completely worthless.\n\nThe reason for the odd limitation could be that Wright does not have the private keys associated with any of the early bitcoin activity. If Wright has no other explanation for the discrepancy, it is as though he had claimed to be King John by pretending to sign a letter, then holding up the bottom of Magna Carta to show off the seal and swearing it was a whole new document.\n\nThe real Nakamoto wouldn’t have to offer up anywhere near as complicated a process as the one Wright proposed. Charlie Lee didn’t create bitcoin but he did create a spinoff, called Litecoin. In just four lines, on Monday, he was able to conclusively prove that, by posting the message “I, Charlie Lee, am the creator of Litecoin” signed with the private key associated with that currency’s Genesis block.\n\nBefore the discrepancy apparently contained in Wright’s blogpost was discovered, doubts had already been raised over his testimony. This started with the first time he was named as the creator of bitcoin, when an “anonymous source” contacted Wired and Gizmodo in 2015.\n\nThe claims from that anonymous tipster unravelled almost as quickly as they were made. Documents that were supposedly published in 2009 were revealed to have been published in 2015 then backdated; a private key linked with the name Satoshi Nakamoto was described as being created in 2008, but using a version of the encryption software only released in 2014; and Wright had, one email suggested, been name-dropping Nakamoto to secure advantages in tax cases and political lobbying. At the time, questions were raised over whether or not Wright himself was the anonymous source who tipped off the two publications.\n\nWright is certainly the source this time round, but the evidence provided is even less compelling than it was before. Nakamoto’s bitcoin billions remain unclaimed.\n\nWright has not responded to a request for comment from the Guardian, but has told the BBC that he will be providing more evidence soon, moving a coin from “an early” bitcoin block. Doing so would demonstrate he has access to the private key for that block, but Wright would still have to provide an explanation for the discrepancies in his initial post to fully convince doubters.', 'In a major move that is undoubtedly going to benefit and bring credibility to bitcoin and digital currencies, derivatives giant CME Group has announced the launch of two bitcoin benchmarks as its newest products. CME Group rival ICE (Intercontinental Exchange Inc) which owns the New York Stock Exchange, will also launch a real-time price index for bitcoin price.\n\nDescribed by The Economist as “the biggest financial exchange you’ve never heard of,” Chicago-based CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Group owns and operates some of the largest derivatives and futures exchanges in multiple cities across the United States.\n\nIn an announcement today, the CME Group unveiled two bitcoin benchmarks for traders and investors by collaborating with digital assets trading platform Crypto Facilities (CF) Ltd.\n\nAltogether, six bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms will provide the pricing data which will help gauge the reference prices. They are Bitfinex, BitStamp, Coinbase, Genesis Global Trading, itBit and Kraken.\n\nIn a statement, executive director at CME Group, Sandra Ro said:\n\nThese products are designed to allow bitcoin traders, companies and other users to rely on a credible reference rate price source.\n\nThe Bitcoin Benchmarks\n\nThe first benchmark will be called the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), a figure that will represent the final settlement price of BTC in USD at 4 PM London Time on each trading day. The BRR will be an aggregate of the trade flow of the above-mentioned bitcoin spot exchanges during a specific calculation window, seen as a once-a-day, transparent BTC reference rate to its USD value.\n\nA newly created oversight committee with CME Group, Crypto Facilities and Imperial College London as core members will be responsible for overseeing the BRR. As a part of their function, the core members will develop a code of conduct for participants and will also ensure BRR’s integrity with a regular review of practices and standards followed in the BRR’s determination process.\n\nDr. Timo Schlaefer, CEO and Co-Founder of Crypto Facilities added:\n\nThe availability of robust reference prices with independent oversight is key to the professionalization of bitcoin trading and further establishes digital assets as a new asset class.\n\nThe second, the CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index (RTI) will enable investors and users with access to real-time numbers of BTC prices. Calculated by Crypto Facilities, the RTI will be calculated on the global demand to buy and sell BTC aggregated into a consolidated order group. Published approximately once every second, the RTI will represent the current market price of BTC in USD.\n\nProf William J.Knottenbelt of Imperial College London opined:\n\nThe Imperial College Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering (IC3RE) welcomes this important step in the further development of the use of cryptocurrency in the derivative markets.\n\nNYSE to Display Bitcoin Price Index\n\nAs revealed by Reuters, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) – owned by CME Group rival ICE (Intercontinental Exchange Inc), is also evaluating the option of using data from multiple digital currency exchanges for its daily settlement price, a feature that it has published since May 2015 with data exclusively from BTC exchange Coinbase. Dwijen Gandhi, head of indexes for the NYSE also revealed that the NYSE will soon launch a real-time BTC pricing index, a move that will “provide additional transparency and insight into the bitcoin price,” Gandhi stated.\n\nThe BRR and the RTI features are scheduled to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'NEW YORK: As a debate raged across the Internet over whether the mysterious founder of the Bitcoin digital currency had finally been identified, executives at a major Bitcoin conference in New York had a simple message: we\'ve moved on.\n\nThat\'s because Bitcoin, the digital currency, has largely been supplanted by blockchain, the technology that underlies it, as the main interest of investors, technology companies and financial institutions.\n\n""If there is a 100% opportunity in the blockchain, Bitcoin, or the currency, is only 1% of it,"" said Jerry Cuomo, vice-president, Blockchain Technologies at International Business Machines Corp. ""So there is a whole 99% that has broad applications across the broad industries.""\n\nOver the past year numerous Wall Street firms, led by Goldman Sachs, have declared their commitment to pursuing blockchain as a potential revolutionary technology for tracking and clearing financial transactions.\n\nThe blockchain technology works by creating permanent, public ""ledgers"" of all transactions that could potentially replace complicated clearing and settlement systems with one simple ledger.\n\nStill, Bitcoin is by far the largest implementation of blockchain technology and there is considerable debate as to whether one can truly develop without the other.\n\n""Bitcoin is still the only blockchain-enabled, cross-border large scale, provable application that\'s actually in production,"" said Joseph Guastella, a principal at Deloitte Consulting in New York. ""Bitcoin as a currency may not be as relevant as it was in many ways, but it actually is relevant as a proof case for the blockchain technology.""\n\nBitcoins are created through a ""mining"" process, in which specialised computers solve complex math problems in exchange for bitcoins. One Bitcoin is equivalent to US$444.75 (RM1,747.67) late on May 2 and trade on various exchanges around the world.\n\nBut Bitcoin transaction volume has been in decline over the past six months amid a bitter split over technical changes in the protocol that are needed to increase the capacity of the system that produces them. Because the cryptocurrency has no formal governance, it relies on a core group of developers for direction – and they are sharply divided over the changes.\n\nBut that debate was of relatively little concern to the blockchain enthusiasts gathered in New York.\n\nAustralian tech entrepreneur Craig Wright identified himself on May 2 as the creator of controversial digital currency bitcoin.\n\n""It\'s irrelevant because his announcement doesn\'t solve a problem or resolve a conflict,"" said Bharat Solanki, managing director at Cambrian Consulting in New York.\n\n""It probably helps to determine the origins of bitcoin but only for recognition,"" Solanki said.\n\nFor Naoki Taniguchi, a global innovation expert at The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd in San Francisco, he does not really care about who created Bitcoin.\n\n""It\'s all about the blockchain,"" he said. — Reuters', 'Former US Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers took part in a fireside chat at Consensus 2016 today, in which he spoke in depth about emerging financial technologies such as blockchain and bitcoin and the impact such inventions could have both separately and together.\n\nModerated by Alan Murray of Fortune Magazine, the session found Summers bringing the dialogue of the bitcoin and blockchain worlds closer together, as he framed the ideas less as competitors, but possible outcomes of a larger change in economic processes enabled by technology.\n\nSummers projected that there would likely be three outcomes from this evolution: That blockchains will co-exist with traditional fiat currencies; that blockchains will be enabled by bitcoin; that blockchains will eventually interact with digital currencies, but not bitcoin.\n\nWhile Summers remains open-minded about the possibility that a digital asset could serve as a global currency or store of value, he predicts that the underlying technology is likely to be more impactful.\n\nSummers told the audience:\n\n""Is the blockchain technology going to be fundamental? I think the answer is overwhelmingly likely to be yes. Is bitcoin going to be a valuable store of value, the same way as people use gold? I don’t know, but I think that certainly the answer is \'no\' doesn’t seem like the right position to take.""\n\nSummers went so far as to predict that this transition could play out in different ways in the wider financial system.\n\nFor example, he said that he believes we could see companies like JPMorgan accommodate bitcoin along side more traditional currencies like dollars and euros.\n\nHe suggested that this transition, however, depends on how quickly it gains traction in the market.\n\n""Bitcoin has the same character a fax machine had. A single fax machine is a doorstop. A world where everyone has a fax machine is an immensely valuable thing,"" he quipped.\n\nRethinking bitcoin\n\nStill, while Summers wouldn\'t place a direct bet against innovators in the space, he said it was likely that the technology underpinning can be replicated by incumbents in potentially successful ways.\n\n""While there are arguments you can’t get all the benefits [of blockchain] without bitcoin, my suspicion is that ways will be found to get those benefits without the uncertainty in the value of bitcoin relative to the ways people hold money and denominate transactions,"" he said.\n\nHowever, he noted in instances of disruptive change, new entrants are perhaps more likely to succeed in developing new technologies, and that he could imagine blockchain disrupting enterprise finance even if digital currencies fail.\n\n""I don’t have a prediction to make with confidence about current big financial institutions, or the aspiring ones represented in this room,"" he said, adding:\n\n""I think it’s not right to say that blockchain is the world of existing financial institutions, and bitcoin is the world of new financial institutions.""\n\nBut, Summers doesn\'t see this as being the responsibility of regulators to prevent, even if it impacts the economy.\n\nHe added: ""I don’t think we should designing our policies with the idea of maximizing employment in the financial sector.""\n\nImage via Mike Cohen for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Jack Markell announced a state initiative to embrace blockchain and smart contract technology to help public and private enterprises lower transactional costs, automate and speed up transactions and reduce fraud.\n\nMarkell announced the plan to look into blockchain technology while delivering a keynote address at Consensus 2016, a New York technology conference on blockchain innovation.\n\nThe Delaware Blockchain Initiative is designed to provide a legal and regulatory environment for developing blockchain technology and encourage blockchain companies to locate in Delaware.\n\nLegal Clarifications Sought\n\nThe state’s legal community will explore the need for clarifications in Delaware corporate law to allow the authorization of “distributed ledger shares” by Delaware corporations, Markell said.\n\nThe initiative is important since the state is home to 66% of Fortune 500 companies, 85% of U.S. initial public offerings, and numerous venture capital backed companies worldwide.\n\nMarkell said smart contracts provide an innovative way to streamline back-office procedures, reduce transaction costs for businesses and consumers, and reduce risk.\n\nWe are delighted that Delaware has this opportunity to help lead the way in promoting blockchain technology and its growing role in digital commerce.\n\nBlockchain-based Smart Contracts To Digitize Records\n\nSmart contracts in distributed ledgers will digitize records to autonomously share, delete, update or be acted upon when certain conditions are achieved, such as expirations. The state expects the technology to bring major efficiencies and speed to commercial transactions for which Delaware has long set the standard.\n\nMarkell also noted the state has started to explore its own use cases for distributed ledger technology.\n\nSymbiont, a smart securities startup focusing on smart contracts and a distributed ledger, is a leader in the blockchain industry that is working with the Delaware Public Archives to store state records on a distributed ledger. The project will demonstrate the chance for the state to use the technology to help archive, cryptographically secure and catalog government records held by state and local agencies that exist in digital form only.\n\nMark Smith, CEO of Symbiont, the technology ambassadors to the State of Delaware, said autonomous record keeping is an important use case for the way smart contracts can deliver a more efficient, transparent and level playing field to the public and private sectors. “In a few years’ time, we’ll look back and see this as an historic moment in the adoption of distributed ledger technology,” he said.\n\nDistributed ledger technology in general and smart contracts, in particular, can transform the way business is done in the capital markets and beyond, said Marco Santori, the leader of Pillsbury law’s blockchain technology legal team.\n\n“We are honored to be recognized by the Governor as Delaware’s legal ambassadors to the blockchain industry, and to have a seat at the table helping to craft this framework,” said Santori.\n\nAlso read: The Block chain: A Banker’s, Police Officer’s & Regulator’s Dream?\n\nState Initiative’s Key Aspects\n\nMarkell emphasized four aspects of the initiative:\n\n• Ensuring that the state’s regulatory environment is enabling the industry as it develops further, rather than immediately enacting regulations regarding licensing of blockchain companies.\n\n• Creating a legal infrastructure for distributed ledger shares in cooperation with the state bar association’s corporation law council. Distributed ledger shares can increase efficiency and speed multifaceted transactions like incorporation services.\n\n• Naming an Ombudsperson, Andrea Tinianow, the State Director of Corporate and International Development, to welcome blockchain companies to Delaware; and\n\n• Committing state government to the use of the technology.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Delaware State.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The introduction of Bitcoin to the world sparked a revolution of finance and economics. Bitcoin set money’s value free from government constraint. Now the value could be determined solely by the market. Instead of depending on centralized third parties for every financial transaction, people could inexpensively exchange value around the world and in a completely decentralized manner.\n\nBitcoin ushered in the age of truly digital cash.\n\nEric Sammons of the Saragossa Group gives an in-depth analysis of the original nature of digital currencies, the creation of Darkcoin, its evolution into Dash and the goals of its developers.\n\nSammons says:\n\n“By creating an open-source money, Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, unlocked vast vistas for others to explore. Over the years many developers have taken up the challenge and built upon the foundation that is Bitcoin to solve many real-world problems. One such person is Evan Duffield.”\n\nThe importance of anonymity\n\nWith a background in both software development and finance, Duffield was captivated by Bitcoin from its earliest days. He was particularly intrigued by the idea of digital cash: a technology which could replicate the features of physical cash but without the drawbacks inherent to conventional currency.\n\nDuffield says:\n\n“I started tinkering with Bitcoin in 2011, really early in its development. I decided I wanted to dive into cryptographic currency and like all things, and the best way for me to learn something new is to either sink or swim.”\n\nAs he studied Bitcoin more deeply, however, he discovered a weakness in its design: a lack of true anonymity. According to Sammons, some might argue anonymity is only essential for those who wish to engage in illegal activities. But this is not the case. Anonymity is necessary for cash for two reasons.\n\nFirstly, it gives each transaction privacy, so that no one can pry into the financial transactions of others. Imagine giving public access to everyone’s credit card transactions. Such information, aside from just violating individuals’ privacy, could be used to manipulate people in many ways.\n\nSecondly, anonymity makes the currency “fungible,” meaning every unit of the currency is worth the same as any other unit. Why is this true? If people could track coins to specific people and transactions, efforts could be made to “taint” coins, for example, if they were previously involved in illegal activities, making them worth less than others.\n\nBitcoin and anonymity\n\nUnfortunately, Bitcoin does not supply true anonymity; each transaction is broadcast on a public blockchain for anyone to study. True, those transactions are not publicly linked to specific individuals, but with enough forensic research one can draw connections between transactions and individuals.\n\nDuffield at first wanted to improve anonymity in Bitcoin itself, but he found that his suggestions were not accepted by the core Bitcoin developers. So, in the grand tradition of open source technology, he decided to fork the project and create his own digital coin. He called it “Darkcoin,” reflecting the anonymity of the currency, and released it on January 18, 2014. Calling Darkcoin a “more private blockchain,” Duffield marketed it as a “privacy-centric” currency. Thus, a new coin was born.\n\nThe initial reception was nothing short of remarkable. People quickly realized that Darkcoin solved a real-world digital currency problem, and the price reflected that realization. Users flocked to the coin, and soon its market capitalization was one of the highest of any digital currency.\n\nIn its first year Darkcoin overcame a number of technical hurdles – inventing a whole new way of implementing money isn’t for the fainthearted – and became one of the top digital currencies on the market.\n\nFrom Darkcoin to Dash\n\nThat’s only the beginning of the story, however. From these humble origins something greater was introduced to the world, perhaps even greater than Duffield himself realized. For the technical solution to implementing an anonymous currency held the seeds to much more.\n\nDuffield created an incentivized 2nd-tier of nodes (called “Masternodes”), more powerful than regular Bitcoin nodes, which would be the foundation for a whole host of future features, many of which weren’t even considered when Darkcoin was first created. Sammons points out that anyone who has worked in software development knows how important the initial foundation of a project is. Without a robust infrastructure, there are limitations as to what can be accomplished as the project matures.\n\nSammons says:\n\n“This Masternode network became the robust foundation to which more and more features could be added – features which are not possible for Bitcoin or other coins without a 2nd-tier network of nodes.”\n\nBy creating a Masternode network, Duffield gave his coin a leg-up in building future features into the coin. Unlike Bitcoin nodes, Masternodes receive payments for their service to the network. Because they are incentivized, more can be demanded of them: more powerful hardware, required software upgrades, etc.\n\nDuffield notes:\n\n“I first discovered a way to make a decentralized anonymity engine, something that had never been done before, then I continued to find other new concepts such as decentralized funding, decentralized governance and a decentralized storage engine.”\n\nAs the project began to include more features, however, the Darkcoin name became a liability instead of a strength. It emphasized only the one aspect of the project – anonymity – and not everything it had the potential to become. Further, public perception was that the Darkcoin name referred to its use in illegal activities, which was never the intention of the project.\n\nAs Duffield noted, “It became apparent that the Darkcoin branding was getting in our way, so in order to accomplish our greater mission, we decided rebranding was necessary.” So the name was changed from Darkcoin to “Dash.” A shortened form of “digital cash,” the revised name is a reflection of Duffield’s original vision for the project.\n\nLooking into the future\n\nSince its creation, the Dash Masternode network has shown itself capable of handling new features. Over the past two years, the following Dash features have been added:\n\nInstantX: To solve the problem of lag time in transactions, Masternodes are able to instantly lock transactions.\n\nSelf-Budgeting: To solve the problem of lack of funding for development, Masternodes can direct funds right from the blockchain to support development.\n\nSelf-Governance: To solve the problem of making governance decisions on the future of the currency, Masternodes can vote on what development occurs.\n\nAccording to Sammons, this is just the beginning. Dash’s powerful Masternode network allows for features in the protocol level that other digital currencies must push off to centralized third parties.\n\nWith Dash, almost any feature can be decentralized and included at the protocol level. For example, the next phase of the Dash project, called Evolution, will introduce a new level of user-friendliness to a space which is not typically known for it.\n\nDuffield’s excitement for the future of Dash is apparent as he says that “[Dash Evolution] is a next-generation platform for purely decentralized e-commerce. This system when deployed will allow low-risk reputation-based e-commerce and a completely decentralized arbitration system which can replace centralized escrow services.”\n\nAnd with Dash’s strong foundation, who knows what else is possible in the future?\n\nSammons concludes:', 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

Money Partners Group has invested a total of JPY 49m into TechBureau, which will result in Bitcoin services being rolled between both parties at some point later this year. Keeping in mind how Zaif reported a record Bitcoin turnover earlier this years, exciting things are bound to happen by the look of things.\n\nNot too many details are known about what this collaboration will entail specifically, but it seems obvious it will revolve around the use of Bitcoin technology in some capacity. Moreover, Bitcoin appears to be part of whatever these companies have planned well, which could boost cryptocurrency adoption in Japan over the coming months and years.\n\nSpeaking of which, Japan is warming up to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as of late. Just a few weeks ago, BitFlyer, one of the popular Bitcoin platforms in Japan, has launched their very own online shop which accepts cryptocurrency. Albeit the item selection is still relatively limited for the time being, this is another notch in the belt for Bitcoin enthusiasts in the country.\n\nBut there is more, as the Japanese government has a decision to make on whether or not they will make Bitcoin a legal currency in the region. A revamp of the regulatory framework has been proposed, which is far more lenient towards Bitcoin than ever before. With the global focus on FinTech innovation, this is an opportune time for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in Japan.\n\nSource: SMN Weekly\n\nHeader image courtesy of Money Partners Group & NewsBTC Graphics', 'About The Author\n\nEduardo Gómez is a Computer Science Major from Venezuela, a country with a loyal Bitcoin user base.

It\'s nothing fancy, just a list of transactions. It\'s also at the root of a transformative technology that institutions including the U.K. government, major banks and the state of Delaware are looking to leverage: the blockchain.\n\nWhen Australian businessman Craig Wright claimed this week to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin, he called attention once again to this high-profile cryptocurrency. But more and more financial technology experts agree: It\'s the blockchain technology underlying bitcoin that has even greater potential to change how we make transactions online.\n\nImagine, for a moment, a global, online ledger, or network of ledgers, listing every single transaction in the world. It\'s verified immediately by other people using the system, which protects people\'s privacy, but is transparent enough to allow for oversight from anyone. No one group regulates it, so it\'s neutral and accessible to anyone with a computer. That is the world that visionaries of the blockchain foresee.\n\nYouTube\n\n""In three years, no one is going to be saying blockchain, but everyone is going to be using the blockchain,"" Adam Draper, chief executive of Boost VC, tells American Banker. ""I don\'t say I\'m going to TCP/IP you — I say I\'m going to text you.""\n\nDelaware Gov. Jack Markell says his state is considering using the technology, lauding it for its potential to save costs and make business more efficient. For a state that incorporates more public companies than any other, an open ledger of all transactions, the automation of accounting and record-keeping tasks and expedited transactions that skip over typical bureaucracies and middlemen could ring in big changes.\n\n""We think the benefits could really be tremendous,"" Markell tells the Wall Street Journal.\n\nPlanet Money Planet Money: A Bet Over Bitcoin Episode 515: A Bet Over Bitcoin Listen · 17:06 17:06\n\nThe U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, is looking to use the blockchain to create an unhackable messaging system. ""There is a critical DoD need to develop a secure messaging and transaction platform accessible via Web browser or standalone native application,"" the agency writes in an official call for proposals. ""The platform separates the message creation, from the transfer of the message within a secure courier to the reception and decryption of the message.""\n\nIn Seattle, Microsoft has paired up with R3, a consortium of the world\'s biggest banks that include JPMorgan and Citi, to figure out how to ""accelerate the use of distributed ledger technologies"" in investing, lending and other financial transactions. On Wall Street, Goldman Sachs notes that blockchain has the potential to change ""everything.""\n\nOverseas, several governments are looking to incorporate blockchain into their political or financial systems. Russia\'s National Settlement Depository, which issues domestic corporate bonds, is testing a voting system for shareholder meetings that would rely on blockchain technology for security. The U.K. Government Office for Science also has encouraged the country to adopt the blockchain, touting its potential to ""reduce fraud, corruption, error and the cost of paper-intensive processes.""\n\nJeremy Gardner, chairman of the board at the Blockchain Education Network and an investor at Blockchain Capital, tells NPR the blockchain ""is going to make the financial world, and beyond (remittance, provenance, ownership), achieve a level of unbelievable transparency and auditability that has never occurred in human history.""', 'A review of the exciting ways that Bitcoin will change our financial transactions and how we view money in the future.\n\nWhat fascinates many people is not what Bitcoin is today. Instead, the future possibilities of Bitcoin are seriously validating the idea of crypto-currencies eventually coming into the mainstream, alongside fiat currencies.\n\nOff the bat, the main advantages of this type of digital currency are easy to identify. It is simple to trace Bitcoins, it can be more easily transferred than paper money since it exists in virtual space, and it cannot be stolen easily, unlike paper money.\n\nIf what is believed to be the future of Bitcoin comes to pass, the governments of the world and their associated financial institutions will have no choice but to create, support and circulate crypto-currency, such as Bitcoin, as legal currency alternatives at some point in the future. Here are some of the reasons why many people believe that Bitcoin is the future of money and why this digital currency has such a bright future.\n\nCut Out the Middleman and Transact Peer-To-Peer\n\nIn the future, there will be no need to have a government or central bank to make decisions on currencies. Bitcoin will revolutionize the 21st Century economy and how financial transactions are carried out. Bitcoin is money that is produced by people, to be used by the people and it originates from agreements between the same people. Just as local currencies came to the forefront of finance as the natural next step in the evolution from barter trade, in the future, we can expect to trade in digital money without having to worry about banks, interest rates, the printing or minting process, and any other fees and processes which have become a general part of today’s banking systems.\n\nBitcoin’s Block Chain: The Transaction Ledger of the Future\n\nEveryone the world over, including the biggest players in the financial industry, have praised the Bitcoin Blockchain’s revolutionary capabilities. The blockchain is a virtual shared and public ledger that is at the core of Bitcoin’s protocol. It provides procedures for keeping track of any BTC transactions and in this way, Bitcoin wallets are able to calculate their spendable balance while new transactions can also be verified to confirm that the Bitcoins being spent are actually owned by the spender. In the future and as the technology evolves, it will be used to dealing with common challenges that are currently experienced within the fiat monetary system.\n\nFuture transactions will be conducted without the need for lawyers and paper trails since there is a record of all Bitcoin transactions in history. The Blockchain is definitely the 21st Century’s financial record keeping technology that all central banks wish they had.\n\nPeople, Not Governments, Control Money\n\nBecause governments around the world hold on to and control fiat currency as they wish, they are able to abuse it in different ways, with their citizens ending up paying the price. For political and economic reasons, many governments may deliberately tinker with the monetary system in order to artificially create inflation. On the flipside, if governments created more and more cash, the fiat monetary system would become useless.\n\nMeanwhile, the total amount of Bitcoins is set at 21 million coins, which cannot be inflated. As a result, the flaws in the Keynesian economic theory, developed by the British economist John Maynard Keynes, are non-existent in Bitcoin. Since governments do not have control over the money, they cannot steal it, fix rates, or manipulate the volumes of money available.\n\nFaster Completion of Transactions\n\nPaper currency transactions and bank transfers simply cannot match the speed of Bitcoin-based trading. Transferring a large amount of money from a country to another or from one bank to another is inefficient because of all the moving parts that are needed to make it happen.\n\nTypically, to transfer an amount such as $100,000, you have to go to the bank, be patient as you are interrogated by the bank staff, pay the necessary fees and wait for paperwork and approvals before the cash is finally transferred. The recipient on the other side of this transaction also has to undergo a similar ordeal. All of this may take as long as a day or more to complete.\n\nOn the other hand, it is now common to transfer thousands of dollars over Bitcoin in a matter of seconds and the applicable fees are negligible. In the future, transferring crypto-currencies in a flash will be the norm, rather than the exception.\n\nIn addition, we have seen many companies adopt payments using Bitcoins. In the trading arena, investors are also able to trade Bitcoins in binary currency trading and this enables them to access lucrative investments based simply on the fluctuations in the value of the Bitcoin, irrespective of whether this value is increasing or declining.\n\nBitcoin Will Revolutionize Micropayments\n\nOne of the areas that Bitcoin will revolutionize business is in the area of micropayments. Because of all the steps and ‘middlemen’ needed for online transactions, small payments under $5 attract very high fees, making them impractical for both the buyer and seller.\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin, there are no intermediaries as it is a peer-to-peer transaction. The cost per transaction is less than a penny, and payments are approved and delivered in a flash. In the future, Bitcoin will ensure that traders and buyers involved in micropayment transactions completely forget about the cost of doing business as they make high profits.\n\nInternational Finance Will Be Made More Accessible To the Third World\n\nBillions of people around the world live in developing or underdeveloped countries. For example, if you grew up in a remote region of Africa, where there is no 4G coverage or cable television, you are probably not fortunate enough to live near a major town or have the means to get there except for a muddy track that is miles away. As a result, how would you conduct your global or local business effectively?\n\nBy using Bitcoin for transactions and payments, a text message could be all that you need to send from your basic feature phone in order to conduct global business. Your cheap cell phone becomes a bank where you do business globally without incurring the hefty charges levied by traditional banks.\n\nBitcoin Holders Will Enjoy the Benefits of a Capped Currency\n\nAs stated above, it was decided that the volume of Bitcoin is to be maintained at 21 million coins to be produced up to the year 2140. This can only be changed in the unlikely event that the entire block chain agreed to change this arbitrary value. The result is an appreciation of the currency’s value on a continuous basis, forever.\n\nA New Way to Combat Identity Theft\n\nYou don’t send any personal information when transacting in Bitcoin. On the other hand, when dealing with paper money, your account number along with your ID number, social security information, balance, and address are transferred between banks and systems. You can only HOPE that your information remains safe. The transactions pass through a clearing house where several people have access to your most sensitive data. For this reason, approximately 5% of US residents have had their identity stolen at least once in their lives. In a Bitcoin-driven future, identity theft will be consigned to history.\n\nLow-Cost Money Transfer\n\nWestern Union continues to rake in billions of dollars from the money transfer business as it has no close competitor anywhere in the world. You have to part with up to 15% of the transaction value in order to transfer your cash through the service. You can transfer much more money, much faster while paying pennies using Bitcoin, regardless of where you are sending the cash to. Forward looking businesses will see space for growth in this area, as money is sent to the rightful people and organizations which then enables them to invest in their communities and organizations.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nThere are many more benefits of Bitcoin than can fit into a single article. While it is not the perfect solution to all the world’s monetary problems, its benefits far outweigh the challenges this currency has to overcome. The convenience and security it offers will mean that more and more individuals, businesses and governments will have little choice but to adopt Bitcoin in one form or another.\n\nHeader Image courtesy of NewsBTC', 'Larry Summers knows a thing or two about money. He ran the Treasury Department under President Clinton, and his signature is on the $20 bill. When he has a gripe about the price of something, it’s worth paying attention.\n\nSo what’s bugging him today? Speaking to a room of finance leaders in New York, the present day counterpart of Alexander Hamilton groused about the price of earphones.\n\n“In a world of very sophisticated information technology, it’s kind of a remarkable thing that if I go outside and buy a $400 pair of headphones, $8 will be removed for processing the payments. That’s a lot,” he told Fortune’s Alan Murray at Consensus 2016, a three-day event about financial technology.\n\nThe source of Summers’ ire, though, is not the price of electronics. Instead, the point of his comment was how the U.S. financial system still permits middlemen, like credit card processors, to extract a 3% levy on every consumer transaction, and even more in the case of big ticket items like houses.\n\nIn the future, Summers believes that much-hyped blockchain technology will let banks and other financial institutions clear transactions infinitely faster than they do now. And at a small fraction of the cost.\n\nThe blockchain, if you’re unfamiliar, is the idea of a permanent online ledger where all sorts of transactions—from contracts to payments to title transfers—can be recorded and verified in a tamper-proof record. Currently, banks and business technology companies like IBM (IBM) are pouring money into the concept in the belief that it will dramatically reduce the amount they pay to clearing houses and other record keeping outfits.\n\nSummers’ speech comes at a time when blockchain is achieving a mainstream respectability that has eluded bitcoin, the digital currency that uses the same ledger technology. While many people continue to value the public ledger associated with bitcoin, the backers who champion the currency are regarded by some as deluded fanatics. (One noted digital currency skeptic is JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who offers a cutting rant in the video below).\n\nSummers, however, is less skeptical, telling Murray that he can see a future in which the financial system is based on blockchain and dollars, or perhaps also bitcoin or some other form of digital currency. (Those who like their fin-tech analysis with a grain of salt may wish take note of this FT article, which describes Summers role on the board of a bitcoin startup).\n\n“Is the blockchain technology going to be fundamental to reducing fictions? The answer is overwhelmingly likely to be yes. Is bitcoin going to be a valuable store of value like people use gold? I don’t know,” said Summers at the event.\n\nAs for when the blockchain’s vaunted potential to reduce costs will actually materialize, Summers urged patience. He predicted the technology will display a typical j-curve effect, lowering productivity at the outset while companies rush to invest, but then yielding dramatic improvements further in the future.\n\nSo how much virtual currency does Summers own? For now, it looks like the former Treasury Secretary still prefers benjamins over bitcoins: Summers admitted he has yet to acquire any through Circle or any other currency services. At the close of the interview, Murray gave him 1/100 of a bitcoin to get him started.', 'Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin was recently interviewed on Babbage, a podcast by The Economist. Buterin shared his long-term goals for Ethereum, which is a public blockchain that allows developers to easily deploy decentralized applications.\n\nA Programming Language for Blockchains\n\nWhen asked what inspired him to create Ethereum, Buterin first talked about how Bitcoin originally sparked his interest in blockchain technology. The open, permissionless nature of public blockchains is a key feature that attracted Buterin to the ecosystem. He noted, “I like the idea of 12-year-olds potentially being able to build the next financial system and so forth. That’s a large part of what attracted me [to] blockchain technology.”\n\nWith Ethereum, Buterin intends to allow those programmers (young or old) to build much more than the financial applications of the future. The Ethereum blockchain is Turing complete, which differs from how things have worked in Bitcoin up to this point ? Satoshi Nakamoto (Bitcoin’s creator) purposely limited Bitcoin’s scripting system for security reasons.\n\nButerin explained:\n\n“I thought [those in the Bitcoin community] weren’t approaching the problem in the right way. I thought they were going after individual applications; they were trying to kind of explicitly support each [use case] in a sort of Swiss Army knife protocol.”\n\nWith a Turing complete programming language, the potential applications of the Ethereum blockchain are limited only by a developer’s creativity. Buterin used an analogy to explain how this compares with Bitcoin:\n\n“Instead of creating a device that just does a specific number of things, you have a device that understands and supports this programming language and whatever people want to do [can potentially be implemented].""\n\nButerin mentioned shipment tracking and digital identity systems as two potential applications that could be built (or are being built) on top of Ethereum.\n\nIs Bitcoin the Napster of Cryptocurrencies?\n\nAlthough some claim Ethereum is not a direct competitor with Bitcoin and the two blockchain platforms could work well together, Babbage host Tom Standage asked Buterin if Bitcoin could be the Napster of cryptocurrencies (meaning that it would eventually be replaced by something better).\n\nButerin noted that a pure Bitcoin person (sometimes referred to as a Bitcoin maximalist) would say that other, centralized forms of digital currency from the past, such as David Chaum’s ecash, would be a better fit for the Napster analogy. However, Buterin continued:\n\n“In practice, it’s not nearly so simple because ? I don’t think Bitcoin is going to fail, I don’t think it’s going to disappear, but at the same time, it’s very clearly not going to be the backbone for the entire world with absolutely everything decentralized running on top of it in some shape or form.”\n\nSidechains, a concept created and mainly developed by Blockstream, is an attempt to bring increased functionality to the Bitcoin network and add greater utility to the Bitcoin token. One sidechain project, Rootstock, is a smart contracts platform quite similar to Ethereum. At this year’s MIT Bitcoin Expo, RSK Labs cofounder and chief scientist Sergio Lerner claimed the project was partially put together by mashing together the Bitcoinj and Ethereumj clients.\n\nGoals for Ethereum Are Practical\n\nWhen asked about his long-term goals for Ethereum, the creator of this particular blockchain-based platform remained practical. In regard to whether Ethereum will become the one blockchain to rule them all, Buterin stated, “That could happen, but at the same time, we’re completely prepared for more realistic scenarios.”\n\nIn terms of developers creating a new blockchain for each use case of this new technology, Buterin said:\n\n“There might be some applications that might get their own ledger, [but] there’s just so much different stuff that people are doing with blockchains ? you’re not going to create a specialized platform for each one.”\n\nButerin added, “That’s what people were doing in 2013, and they failed.”\n\nButerin said he would still be happy if Ethereum was simply used for all of the long tail use cases of blockchains that don’t have another specialized system to turn to.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The Marvel wants to replace your computer.\n\nAfter plugging in your Android phone, the headset shows you the applications you have open in a semi-circle around you, hovering over whatever background environment you choose to be in, whether it\'s a sandy beach or the the surface of the moon. By turning your head left and right, you can look at your different apps, easily changing your focus between full-window web browsers, chats and more. For ease of use, you can hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth.\n\nThe Marvel allows you to view multiple windows at once. Image: finman technologies\n\nIf you open up a virtual reality app, the Marvel will recognize that and put you in the app\'s 360-degree environment. Unlike some other VR headsets, it\'s equipped with sensors that enable it to accurately track movement when you look around.\n\nThe Marvel looks a lot like the Oculus Rift; it\'s a black headset with an expectedly bulky ""visor,"" large enough to hold a phone. Like the Samsung Gear VR, all the headset requires is a phone, but the Marvel has a longer list of compatible devices. Finman says it can work with any Android phone running Lollipop or higher.\n\nThe design isn\'t anything innovative, but its features are a pretty fresh concept. Image: Finman technologies\n\nFor those features and compatibility, the Marvel comes at a higher price than the similarly positioned Samsung Gear VR, which costs $100. Finman is selling his headset for $250 ($200 for early birds). The Indiegogo financial goal is $500,000, and he plans an initial run of about 2,000 headsets.\n\nThe team behind it\n\nIf you\'re worried about Finman\'s business savvy, he\'s not doing it on his own. There are seven or eight people working on the project, Finman told Mashable, including some with experience in manufacturing and shipping electronics.\n\nAlthough I am new to manufacturing, these people are not\n\n""For me, I\'m glad that I\'ve hired people that have a lot of experience in shipping and a lot of experience with third-party logistics providers, and a lot of manufacturing and developing experience,"" Finman said. ""Although I am new to manufacturing, these people are not.""\n\nFinman is staying conservative with his timeline, pushing the expected shipping date a few months later than what manufacturers quoted.\n\n""We already got the manufacturer and we already got the quote, so once we give them the thumbs up then they\'ll start production,"" he said.\n\nFinman\'s own brother, Ross, helped develop the Marvel using his background in robotics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nIt all sounds like a fine plan, though Finman has yet to encounter the multitude of issues first-time crowd-funders experience: Manufacturers can fail to deliver up to spec, shipping can hit major delays, and partners can drop out.\n\nNonetheless, Finman is hopeful his campaign will be able to garner as much as $1 million in donations, and he even has the lofty goal of eventually moving production to the U.S. If he\'s even a little successful, the budding world of mobile VR could get a lot more interesting.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

The order book will reflect current market prices of bitcoin in USD and will be published about every second. Crypto Facilities Ltd. will calculate the RTI.\n\nThe announcement comes as Kraken continues to build its reputation as a reliable source of bitcoin market data. In 2014, Kraken became the first bitcoin exchange to supply complete volume and price data to the Bloomberg Terminal. The exchange was chosen to aid in the Mt. Gox exchange investigation last year and announced a multi-million dollar deal with Japanese venture capital firm SBI Investment in February.\n\nImage courtesy of Kraken', 'Boston-based payment platform Circle, which was founded in 2013 and has raised $76 million in venture money, was one of the earliest and best-funded bitcoin companies. Now it has subtly moved beyond the digital currency (but not away from it), and at a time when the popular narrative in fintech is “blockchain, not bitcoin,” Circle is a perfect example of a company straddling both worlds.\n\nCircle’s value proposition is pretty simple: send money anywhere, in any currency, without the friction (transfer delays and fees) of traditional clearance options like Western Union. That is also the biggest selling point of bitcoin, and when Circle first launched, you could only deposit, hold, and send bitcoin.\n\nA lot has changed in two years. Circle still runs on the bitcoin blockchain as its rail, but now Circle users can deposit money to Circle from a Visa or MasterCard credit or debit card, and never have to deal with bitcoin at all. (Circle’s website doesn’t even mention the digital currency.) This month, Circle scored a new partnership with Barclays (BCS), which allows Circle customers to hold and send British pounds. “No one ever sees bitcoin, it’s just underneath,” says co-founder Jeremy Allaire. “If you want to, you can. But we think the number of people who want a non-state-sponsored digital currency as their primary currency is really small.” Circle uses the bitcoin blockchain because it is permissionless, open and global—and that will be its key weapon in the battle over payment apps, which has heated up quickly. (For more on exactly how the blockchain works, watch this video.)\n\n\n\nPlayers like Venmo (owned by PayPal) and TransferWise have gained fast traction among users, while the typical U.S. consumer still doesn’t know Circle. But Venmo is only functional in the U.S. (you can’t use it to send money to another country), and TransferWise is the inverse (you can only send money from the U.S. to another country). Circle is not ""closed"" like those platforms, says co-founder Sean Neville, and it’s still so early in this space that Circle isn’t too worried about making up ground with user awareness. “It’s a lot like the days of the early online systems, like America Online,” he says, “where we could send messages or content to each other as long as we were both subscribers of that system. We see these new behaviors developing in a more open manner worldwide.”\n\nAllaire has an additional way of brushing aside these competitors, which tout features like “cross-border payments” in their marketing. “Our view is that there is no difference between a domestic payment or an international payment or a cross-border payment, those distinctions just disappear,” he says. “When was the last time you sent a cross-border email? Or had an international web-browsing session? The user doesn’t care. We’re trying to make money work that way.”\n\nThat\'s pretty straightforward and exciting—the idea of sending money being as simple as chatting with someone over Skype (Allaire\'s preferred analogy). To be sure, there is one inherent contradiction in using the blockchain for bank-based payments: Many consumers and banks have serious fears about the bitcoin blockchain\'s permissionless structure.\n\nSome of the very same banks that Circle has partnered with or will need to partner with have moved toward the idea of closed, permissioned blockchain technology (without bitcoin), away from the open blockchain Circle uses. Neville\'s response to that? ""They’re not necessarily mutually exclusive. We got excited about the idea of bitcoin and blockchain simply because it enabled money to work the way the rest of the Internet does. We can share photos, share opinions, but we can’t share money very easily.

05/05/2016,"['Wright, who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s creator, says he is ‘sorry’ and ‘does not have the courage’ to proceed further with his claims\n\nCraig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, has backtracked on a pledge to provide proof of his earlier claims.\n\nDespite promising on Tuesday that he would be offering “extraordinary evidence” to verify his claim that he is really Satoshi Nakamoto, Wright wiped his blog on Thursday, replacing it only with a message headlined: “I’m Sorry.”\n\nIn the new message, Wright continues to maintain that he really is Nakamoto, but accepts that the total absence of credible evidence means few are likely to believe him. “I believed that I could do this,” he writes. “I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.”\n\nInitially, Wright attempted to prove his claim by posting what he said was a digital signature, signed using a private key that could only have been held by the real Satoshi Nakamoto. In fact, while Wright did post such a signature, it emerged that it had been directly copied from a 2009-era bitcoin transaction and was not freshly created, as he had claimed.\n\nThat discrepancy led to Wright’s claims being dubbed a “scam” and “cryptographically verifiable fraud” by security researcher Dan Kaminsky. Wright initially promised to provide further evidence, but has now reneged on that, seemingly permanently.\n\nWright’s post continues: “When the rumors began, my qualifications and character were attacked. When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this.”\n\nHe also apologised to the two senior bitcoin figures who had backed up his claim before he went public. “I know that this weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me, and particularly to Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen. I can only hope that their honour and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions. They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now. I can only say I’m sorry. And goodbye.”\n\nAndresen had publicly questioned Wright’s evidence a few days after it was made public, saying on Tuesday: “I was as surprised by the ‘proof’ as anyone, and don’t yet know exactly what is going on.” Jon Matonis, however, seems to still believe in Wright, tweeting on Thursday that “there won’t be an on-chain signing from early bitcoin blocks, but there also won’t be another Satoshi.”\n\nWright made his initial claims to three publications: GQ, the BBC and the Economist. A fourth, the London Review of Books, is due to publish a longer feature written by Andrew O’Hagan. It is unclear what will happen to the piece following Wright’s climbdown.\n\nAccording to Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC reporter who was one of the three journalists to publicise Wright’s initial claims, Wright had already begun the process by which he intended to prove his identity before he reneged on his promise and published the apologetic statement.\n\nCellan-Jones says that Wright had asked him, Andresen and Matonis to each transfer about £5 to a bitcoin address used in the first bitcoin transaction. The plan was for Wright to then return the money, proving he had access to that address. But while they did send the money on Wednesday, Wright never returned it.\n\nEven if he had, that might not have been enough evidence to convince many skeptics. Multiple times, Wright has claimed to have access to that specific bitcoin address, which corresponds to the ninth block” of bitcoin to be created, a little over an hour after the first. But the real Nakamoto should have access to many other private keys, including the “genesis block” itself.\n\nWright has apparently demonstrated his access to that block in private, to the Economist’s Ludwig Siegele and Andresen among others, but has released no public proof of the same, something that both men say raises questions.', 'Gemini, the bitcoin currency exchange operated by investors Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss, has received approval from the state of New York to offer trading for ether, the native token of the Ethereum network.\n\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) announced the approval today, a move the department said was necessary given that the agency has the mandate to review any material changes to the services offered by industry firms.\n\nThe exchange, approved to open last October, had received the greenlight to operate as a limited purpose trust company from the NYDFS, though it is not regulated under the BitLicense, the state\'s industry-specific licensing regime.\n\nYet the exchange has struggled to capture the attention of bitcoin traders since then. According to figures from Coinmarketcap, Gemini saw 811 BTC (or roughly $360k) in trading over the past 24 hours. Such figures are below competitors such as Bitfinex and Coinbase, which traded 8,686 BTC and 5,331 BTC, respectively, over the last day.\n\nIn a statement released by the NYDFS, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the move is in line with the state’s efforts to support ""new innovations and emerging industries"", remarking:\n\n""With robust regulatory oversight, we are maintaining our status at the forefront of this technological revolution and ensuring that users have a safe and secure experience.""\n\nThe forthcoming launch of ether trading, scheduled for Monday, the NYDFS said, represents its first approval for a digital currency-related service beyond bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the NYDFS told CoinDesk that such activity was already ""permissible"" with their existing charter.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state’s financial regulator is close to approving licenses for bitcoin companies Coinbase Inc and Ripple Labs Inc, which would allow them to offer digital currency services in the state, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.\n\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services received applications from both companies, according to an April 28 notice published on the regulator’s website. The notices, usually published after virtual currency firms have completed the regulator’s paperwork, signal that the licensing process is nearly complete, according to the person familiar with the matter and other sources.\n\nAn exact time frame for approval of the licenses is not yet clear. The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nBitcoin is a Web-based “cryptocurrency” that enables users to move money across the world quickly and anonymously without the need for third-party verification. Despite being championed by some as the digital money of the future, it is often dismissed as a currency that is too volatile to invest in.\n\nLast year, New York became the first U.S. state to issue extensive rules for virtual currency companies. The guidelines, aimed at consumer protection and prevention of money laundering, require companies to obtain what is known in the state as a “BitLicense.”\n\nBoth Coinbase and Ripple are based in San Francisco.\n\n“We are committed to being fully compliant with all state and federal laws and applied for the license to ensure we remain so,” said a Ripple spokesman, who declined to elaborate. Coinbase declined to comment.\n\nThe four-year-old Coinbase is one of the world’s largest U.S.-based bitcoin companies. Among its backers are USAA and venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Ribbit Capital. Coinbase, which markets its services to consumers and merchants, has also applied for a license that would allow it to facilitate dollar transactions.\n\nBackers of Ripple, which filed for the license under the corporate name XRP II LLC, also include Andreessen Horowitz along with Google Ventures and IDG Capital Partners. Ripple’s service and currency, known as XRP, is for financial institutions and companies, such as banks, that provide liquidity for foreign exchanges.\n\nOnce approved, the licenses would add to a nascent digital currency industry taking hold in New York. On Thursday, NYDFS approved the application of Gemini Trust Company, founded by investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, to trade a digital currency called ether on its bitcoin exchange.', ""Is less actually more? Will halving be a boon to Bitcoin or an absolute curse that will lead to a spectacular crash?\n\nMoney needs to be printed to be used, it has to be brought into circulation. Whether it is paper based or virtual, someone has to decide how much of it is going to be brought to life and when.\n\nFiat currency and Bitcoin mining\n\nUsually fiat currencies are printed by central banks to control inflation or as a part of a wider monetary policy of a nation-state.\n\nIn case of virtual currencies, since there is no national government involved or fixed borders, other means need to be deployed to manage money supply.\n\nBitcoin is supplied by ‘mining’ a process which involves doing complicated mathematical calculations using special software and hardware.\n\nThe creator of Bitcoin ensured that only a limited amount of Bitcoin could ever be brought into circulation and that number is pegged at 21 million.\n\nHe or She also ensured that mining becomes progressively difficult as time goes along and more Bitcoin are mined.\n\nWe know from Blockchain.info that as of April 2016, there are about 15 million plus Bitcoin in circulation.\n\nSource: Blockchain.info\n\nThe halving and what it is all about\n\nThe Bitcoin system was so designed that from time to time mining value is halved.\n\nThe next time this is supposed to happen is on July 11, 2016. Halving will have a dramatic effect on miners as their income will drop significantly.\n\nThe difficulty level of mining Bitcoin will also ensure that smaller miners will no longer find it viable to mine the cryptocurrency leaving the mining space to large operators or pooled mining companies.\n\nThis trend has already been observed with the Chinese taking up mining on a large scale and mining more than half of the Bitcoin mining that happens today.\n\nSo what effect will halving have on Bitcoin? Will it lead to an increase in Bitcoin prices or is it time for a massive crash? We talked with a few industry experts.\n\nThe long and short of it\n\nExperts are definitely split into two when it comes to Bitcoin price after halving and those that are bullish on halving have their own reasons.\n\nHowever we tried to get both a short term and long term view of the halving situation.\n\nAleksandar Matanovic, CEO of ECD.rs, a Bitcoin exchange, says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Short term, I think price will go down. A lot of people are expecting the price to rise after the halving and those who want to take advantage of that will buy before the halving, hoping to sell at the higher price after the halving. It will push the price up prior to the halving.”\n\nMatanovic thinks that according to the Efficient Market Hypothesis prices already reflect all information that is available to them and have factored in the halving.\n\nHe thinks that the current prices have taken the phenomenon into account and that is why prices of Bitcoin won’t rise immediately after halving contrary to what many speculators believe.\n\nHe is of the view that long term Bitcoin prices should rise.\n\nMatanovic adds:\n\n“We will have 75 new bitcoins each hour compared to 150 we have now. So, if the demand keeps rising at the similar rate it has been rising lately, the new supply rate won't be enough to keep the balance and it will push the price up.”\n\nPrice increase with sharp falls\n\nDavid Duccini, Strength in Numbers Foundation, says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“If the price doesn’t move to match costs, there could be a precipitous drop in hashing power, which should be offset by the drop in difficulty, but who knows.”\n\nWe also had a word with Fran Strajnar, Co-founder of BraveNewCoin.com who presented a detail long and short term analsysis of the halving.\n\nTaking a short term view he explains:\n\n“With the current positive market sentiment momentum and not long to go until halving, we will see a continued, steady, price-increase with sharp falls on the way.”\n\nOn a longer term he believes that most miners will hedge in different ways and stop liquidating coins as much as they can till the price reaches a level where they can achieve current margins.\n\nHe thinks they can wait up to 6 or greater months to start taking profits again at US$ 700- US$ 850 price range.\n\nStrajnar concludes:"", 'Bill Barhydt talks fast, often in big, sweeping terms that pass with the frequency of mile markers.\n\n""We are basically preparing Abra to go global as quickly as possible,"" he says in interview.\n\nOn the phone with CoinDesk, Barhydt even sounds as if he’s flying through space and time, the wind rushing around him audibly as we kick off a conversation about Abra, the peer-to-peer ""digital cash"" startup for which he has served as CEO since 2014.\n\nWhile Barhydt exudes velocity, the language he employs seem a far cry from his startups muted public presence.\n\nWhile the company has raised $14m in two funding rounds, its blog has been updated just a few times since last September, and announcements have been few and far between. Today, Abra is live in only one market. To Barhydt, this is the calm before the storm.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""You will see Abra live in lots of places this year, with some really cool partner announcements and availability announcements. The organized chaos of Abra is moving at a very rapid rate.""\n\nBarhydt is just as quick in describing the process of Abra’s forthcoming expansion, even with all its complexities. Somehow he reduces balancing acts like signing up global merchants to bootstrap a global cash app, enlisting money services businesses in this network and navigating local regulations into a fairly short series of sentences.\n\nAll of this comes even while he refers to Abra as a company that could create the first ""viable consumer experience"" with blockchain technology – one that, at scale, aims to provide users around the world with abilities never before offered by payments firms.\n\nLast-mile concerns? Liquidity management? Barhydt believes Abra can put these challenges in the rearview.\n\nMaterials provided to CoinDesk back up this ambitious scope, indicating that Abra told investors it plans to launch in Australia, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and throughout the Americas, a total of more than 20 countries, by November 2017.\n\nBut if this all seems a little fast, Barhydt believes it’s anything but. He stresses that Abra is already the product of two years of work.\n\n""The Philippines is a domestic microcosm of what you should expect to see at a much larger scale. It gives us the ability to test on a small scale with no marketing,"" Barhydt said, adding:\n\n""That’s going to change fairly soon.""\n\nSingle market focus\n\nBut what\'s going on with Abra in the Philippines? That seems hard to say. Abra’s Google Play app has 70 or so reviews, and while it has a four-star overall rating, some of the higher ones are from users on the waitlist for the app.\n\nThe more negative ones point out an issue Barhydt seems eager to address, the current inability for users to send value abroad. But, he says, the app works the same in the Philippines as it will at scale, and that the experience has been valuable for the young company.\n\n""Our goal has been to leverage tests to make sure that everything is able to scale well once it’s working in dozens of countries,"" Barhydt said. He expects the Philippines to become a “major corridor” for Abra, the term evoking a remittance company, though Abra prefers to refer to itself as a peer-to-peer network.\n\nToday, Barhydt said, the Abra network allows users to cash out digital currency to any bank account in the country, while four banks enable buying. The Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), Metrobank and UnionBank of the Philippines are three that allow Abra users to convert fiat funds to digital cash.\n\nAs for whether Abra has direct relationships with these banks, Barhydt suggested that engagement with financial institutions might not be a core part of his strategy.\n\n""The relationship is simple, we’re using third-party partners to act as payment gateways and we make that process as transparent as possible,"" he said. ""Abra itself does not have to enter into formal relationships.""\n\nBuilding a network\n\nBut, banks are just one piece of the puzzle. Merchants, Barhydt acknowledges, are as “key” to the company’s future as they are to modern-day cash networks.\n\n""We believe that Abra’s ability to do cross-border commerce, person-to-person or person-to-merchant, is a big competitive advantage,"" he said.\n\nIn this respect, Barhydt asserts, Abra is also seeking to make both its merchant and consumer wallet applications operate similarly. During a transaction, merchants and consumers can receive funds in any currency using Abra\'s smart contract technology.\n\nAcquiring merchants could prove challenging, though, given that they are historically picky about their preference of technologies. The chip-card technology EMV, for example, took years to reach widespread adoption in the US, and still sees complaints from merchants and consumers who have had their decades-long point-of-sale experiences disrupted.\n\nBut Barhydt sees the biggest potential impact for Abra in online commerce, where he says users will be able to type their phone number into a web page, receive a push notification, and then send the funds to the merchant’s address through the bitcoin blockchain. This, he says, will be beneficial for high-risk transactions.\n\nHow all this works is complex, though. For instance, Abra needs consumers and merchants to buy and hold digital currency, and for tellers to see a market in providing this service to these two parties as a business opportunity.\n\nMaster tellers, in turn, need to join the network to provide compliance and oversight to tellers, and to interact with exchanges to turn funds into fiat money. Exchanges would then hold bank accounts on behalf of the tellers, merchants and master tellers.\n\nFor all the intricacies, the front-end user experience aims for a minimalistic simplicity.\n\n""From a merchant’s perspective, these are cash transactions that settle in near-real time in local currency, that have no chargeback risk and no foreign exchange risk,” he continued.\n\nExperience first\n\nAs with fellow payments industry startup Circle, user experience is key, as Barhydt believes consumers are unlikely to adopt a new technology like digital currency outright, instead preferring to keep funds in government-backed money.\n\n""We understand why it’s cool, but we think that’s the wrong perspective,"" he said.\n\nIt’s this part of the company’s strategy that many observers in the space have questioned its ability to execute. Yet Barhydt asserts that the company has figured out the solution.\n\n“Think of the currency a consumer or merchant is holding with Abra as a synthetic fiat currency that is effectively a hedged digital currency. It’s hedged bitcoin, but that’s extremely difficult to do correctly. From my knowledge, we’re the first to figure it out,” he said.\n\nDocuments reveal Abra’s system works by borrowing bitcoin from mining pools, which is then sold on an exchange, creating a short position that it says provides liquidity for Abra. Covering the short, the company says, doesn’t generate liquidity risk, as Abra tellers will eventually need to sell bitcoin.\n\nThe company has indicated that US dollar shorts could even become one of the ways that, long term, help make the company profitable.\n\nUser strategy\n\nHow much of this process is being disclosed to users is unclear, though Barhydt indicates that users don’t need to understand how their value is managed, just as they don\'t need to understand how text messages are routed around the globe.\n\n""Once Abra is live everywhere, we have the first p2p payment app that will work across any two phone numbers. There’s no other app on the planet that does that. It’s WhatsApp for payments,"" he said.\n\nFrom there, Barhydt said, Abra has an opportunity few of its competitors do: the possibility that its product could go viral. But, how long this will take is a matter that only time will tell.\n\nIt\'s fitting then the conversation with Barhydt seems to hit a pause. The wind sounds are suddenly gone and it’s silent around him. It appears for now, Barhydt has reached at least one destination.\n\nAs for when he will be able to say the same for Abra, that’s less certain.\n\n“I don’t know if the hockey stick will happen, but we have a high chance it could happen,” he said, adding:\n\n""We’re chomping at the bit.""\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Abra.\n\nImages via Abra\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Similarly Bitcoin enables borderless, permissionless, fast and cheap access to the world of finance.\n\nBitcoin is the Internet of money...\n\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis and the current global financial crisis, the world is increasingly realizing the weaknesses of our current financial system. A majority of central banks in the world now have 0 interest rates. Countries like Russia, Latin America have seen record breaking currency devaluations.\n\nBitcoin provides the vision of a new era in the financial world. By purchasing bitcoins, it allows ordinary people to protect themselves from the possibility of a sudden drop in the purchasing power of their money because of a debt ridden government.\n\nThe current western financial infrastructure based on banks, credit card companies and a mish mash of different payment networks is at a very early stage in India. 60% of our population is unbanked and credit and debit card penetration is in single digit percentages. Our PM and the RBI both have financial inclusion as a top priority.\n\nJust like mobile phones helped India skip the landline generation in connecting a billion Indians, embracing Bitcoins can help India skip the current generation of financial infrastructure and move India directly to the future of finance.\n\nA financial infrastructure based on Bitcoin and its underlying technology Blockchain will herald a revolution just like the Internet. Very similar to the Internet, Bitcoin is a free to join, open source, decentralized network. Bitcoin is a sound currency which has all the best characteristics of sound money. And the Bitcoin network is the fastest, cheapest and easiest way to send money from one person to the other.\n\nAlready progressive governments like the UK and Singapore are pro Bitcoins and trying to attract Bitcoin companies to operate in their jurisdiction by providing them favourable working conditions.\n\nState of Bitcoins in 2016\n\nSince the beginning of the year, global economic landscape witnessed a disastrous start with all major stock exchanges around the world taking a nosedive. Some respected financial services firms like UK’s RBS have even suggested their investors to sell everything. They have predicted a global recession, worse than 2008 comparing the current scenario with that before the Lehman Brothers crises.\n\nThe world is in an unprecedented economic crisis with the value of commodities and currencies nose diving. In such gloomy situations, investors will prefer to diversify their portfolio, especially where the future lies. Since the supply of Bitcoins is fixed, its increasing demand has pushed the price of Bitcoin from a few Rs in 2010 to more than Rs 25,000 currently. In the next 5 years as the supply reduces further and more and more people adopt Bitcoins, the price is expected to scale new highs.\n\nGenerally, when market is going to witness some sort of scarcity or controlled supply in a promising concept – like Bitcoin, the demand starts rising with positive sentiments. That said, markets start making speculative moves and this pushes its price upwards thus building pressure to grab the opportunity and get share in the revolutionary future.\n\nGlobal Bitcoin trade is skyrocketing touching 35 billion USD per month in December 2015. Billion dollar companies like Dell, Expedia, Overstock, Rakuten (Japan’s Flipkart) have started accepting Bitcoins on their websites.\n\nBitcoin companies raised almost 1 billion USD in VC funding in 2015. All the major banks and credit card companies have got involved with Bitcoins last year. So in just 6 years of its existence, Bitcoin has achieved spectacular success.\n\nIn India, Bitcoin adoption has had a slow start but awareness is growing rapidly. Bitcoin trade in India grew exponentially and is at an estimated Rs 500 crores per year. There are around 50,000 Bitcoin wallets in India and around 700-800 Bitcoins are traded everyday.\n\nRBI, in its recent report on financial stability, has appreciated the strengths of the underlying ‘blockchain’ technology.\n\nIndia’s leading law firm Nishith Desai Associates and the Center for Internet and Society, both have published white papers stating that Bitcoins is legal in India under all existing laws.\n\nAfter early adopters, Bitcoins is attracting a new class of users like professionals, HNIs and all institutions. As the Bitcoin community matures, we shall see an increase in the quality of analysis of Bitcoins price.\n\nUsers are now using bitcoin for eCommerce, airtime top up, paying bills, buying gift vouchers from popular online retail sites. Bitcoin transactions in India are about Rs 500 crores a year. We believe India will see an explosion in bitcoins over next 2 years.\n\nChina does a volume of more than Rs 10,000 crores per ‘day’ (no typos here) India is where US and China were in 2013. About 40% of the population across the country does not have bank accounts. Bitcoin wallets could be used in remote areas without the need for brick and mortar banks.\n\nIndia is the world’s biggest remittance market at more than $70 billion. The majority of the remittance is small amounts of around $200. For small amounts especially, users end up paying up to 15% in fees to companies like PayPal, Western Union or to banks through transfer and exchange rate fees. Bitcoin makes it extremely easy to send a small remittance back home. This could save India upto $7 billion in fees paid to third party and add to country’s wealth.\n\nIndia is perfect as a society to be at the forefront of developing a vibrant crypto-currency economy.\n\nAbout the Author: Mr Sandeep Goenka, co-founder Zebpay, a Bitcoin marketplace in India.', ""After having been given $1,000 by his grandma at only 13-years-old, Erik Finman, now 17, made the risky decision to invest in the notoriously volatile Bitcoin market. His investment very much paid off.\n\nWhen he was 15, only a year and a half later, he liquidated his Bitcoins, making a cool $100,000. He’s now crowdfunding his very own VR headset. He has been featured in Time Magazine, Mashable, CBS News, Business Insider, The Times, BBC, and more.\n\nFrom Bitcoin investment to Marvel VR headset\n\nAfter Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed past the $1000 per bitcoin mark in 2014, Erik Finman, having presumably bought in at the sub-$100 per bitcoin mark in 2013, sold for monumental profits.\n\nIn his TEDxTeen talk, he says about this experience:\n\n“I was competitive with my brother. And he was going on and on about this thing called Bitcoin, which, he said, was going to replace the dollar, was the currency of the future. I didn’t really care but I wanted him to shut up. Using all the money that I saved up, I decided to buy more coins than he had. That turned out really well for the future.”\n\nErik then used these newly acquired funds to start up an online tutoring service called Botangle. He wanted to address some of the negative experiences he had with the educational system and provide learning that was focused on the student.\n\n“High School dropout that made 100k & started Botangle”, as he put it in his LinkedIn profile, Erik seems to have moved on, at least temporarily, from the world of online education, and has made plans to launch his own virtual reality headset, The Marvel.\n\nThe Marvel is a VR headset that is designed to work exclusively with a large array of Android smartphones.\n\nThe device differs from other competitors in the market in that its purpose is not solely to view 360° VR content. The user plugs in their Android phone and the headset presents all open applications in a semi-circle around you, hovering in the air.\n\nMoving your head around will have the expected effect, allowing you to view all your open apps. You can view multiple windows at once, and connecting a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth is also possible.\n\nWhen a virtual reality app is opened on the phone, it is recognised by the Marvel, which inserts you into the app’s 360° environment.\n\nThe headset looks very much the same to other headsets on the market, like the Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive, but like Samsung’s headset, the visor is larger to accommodate a phone. All Android phones running Lollipop OS or higher will be able to use the headset.\n\nThe Marvel Team\n\nDespite seeming to have overlooked a huge opportunity to call their development team ‘The Avengers’, the team chose the path or least lawsuits, and, with seven or eight people working on the project, with various experience in manufacturing and shipping electronics, Finman assures potential buyers of their purchase.\n\nHe says to Mashable:\n\n“Although I am new to manufacturing, these people are not… For me, I'm glad that I've hired people that have a lot of experience in shipping and a lot of experience with third-party logistics providers, and a lot of manufacturing and developing experience. Although I am new to manufacturing, these people are not...We already got the manufacturer and we already got the quote, so once we give them the thumbs up then they'll start production.”\n\nErik’s brother, Ross, has a background in robotics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and helped develop the device.\n\nThis is Erik’s first venture into the world of crowdfunding, so he has been deliberately conservative with his timeline to account for any unforeseen issues in management, manufacturing, or shipping, and the expected shipping date is a few months after the quoted date.\n\nHe launched his campaign on the crowdfunding site, Indiegogo, on Wednesday, and hopes to receive $500,000 in funding. It’s priced at $250, or $200 for early birds, compared to $100 for the Samsung Gear VR, and Finman plans to initially produce about 2,000 headsets.\n\nIn the future, Finman hopes to receive $1 million in donations and eventually move production to the US.\n\nAs he told young innovators at WIRED 2015 Next Generation, “just be yourself and jus do what you love”. It looks like Finman is sticking to his own advice.\n\nHowever, in his interview to New York Magazine Erik says:\n\n“I feel ancient. I guess the older you get, you have to stand on your own accomplishments. I feel I haven’t done enough. At 16, it feels less impressive. It makes me motivated to do more and more.”\n\nCoinTelegraph wishes him the best of luck in his attempt to enter the interesting world of mobile VR."", 'During a recent presentation at Paralelni Polis in Prague, Czech Republic, Blockstream President Adam Back shared his personal vision for scaling Bitcoin to handle more users over the next few years. His plan is mostly based on the Bitcoin Core roadmap for capacity increases (originally written up by Blockstream CTO and Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell on the Bitcoin development mailing list).\n\nIf implemented, Back’s plan for scaling Bitcoin would double the on-chain transaction capacity on the network three years in a row, while simultaneously allowing for the development of layer-2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, which, according to its creators, could allow for millions or billions of transactions per second across the network.\n\nSegregated Witness Soft Fork\n\nThe first improvement listed on Adam Back’s proposed roadmap was Segregated Witness (SegWit), which provides a variety of improvements to Bitcoin’s scalability prospects. The improvement effectively increases the block size limit to roughly 1.7 MB (a 70 percent increase), and it also enables further scaling enhancements such as the Lightning Network and schnorr signatures.\n\nDuring his recent presentation, Back briefly covered the incentives for wallet providers to implement this upgrade:\n\n“It provides scale to those people who opt-in, so if I’m running a payment processor and I upgrade the library that I’m using and move to the new types of addresses, which are backwards compatible, then I get cheaper transactions or access to more scale.”\n\nBack also pointed out that those who don’t upgrade also benefit from this change because those who implement SegWit will leave more empty space for non-upgraded clients to fill with transactions.\n\nA pull request that implements Segregated Witness in Bitcoin Core (the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol) has already been made. The code is now going through vigorous review and testing.\n\nSchnorr Signatures Soft Fork\n\nA change in Bitcoin’s digital signature scheme used for signing transactions (currently ECDSA) could allow for up to two times as many transactions to fit in a block. This gain in efficiency is made possible by switching to Schnorr signatures. Adam Back explained, “We can make the transactions smaller. From the same block size, we can get more transactions if we use this different type of signature.”\n\nWhen combined with Segregated Witness, Schnorr signatures would enable the throughput equivalent of a three to four megabyte block size limit.\n\nBack also noted Schnorr signatures could be implemented in Bitcoin before the end of the year. He added, “This is relatively close technology. There are not too many unknowns about how to do this.”\n\nIBLT and Weak Blocks\n\nAfter Schnorr signatures, Adam Back would like to see Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLT) and Weak Blocks implemented in Bitcoin. These improvements do not change Bitcoin’s consensus rules, so they do not require a hard fork or soft fork to implement.\n\nThe main issues addressed by these changes are related to block propagation and orphan blocks. With IBLT and Weak Blocks, the latency bottleneck on Bitcoin’s ability to scale is replaced with a bandwidth bottleneck. Back noted, “The network actually has excess bandwidth.”\n\nThe improvements in block latency made possible by these two improvements are accomplished by spreading out bandwidth usage over time. In other words, all of the information related to a block does not need to be propagated through the network in one chunk, which means it takes a shorter amount of time for full nodes to receive critical information about new blocks.\n\nBy solving the latency issues related to the propagation of newly-mined blocks around the network, it may become safer to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit further in the future.\n\nBlockstream Core Tech Engineer Rusty Russell and Popeller Founder Kalle Rosenbaum gave an in-depth presentation on IBLT and Weak Blocks at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong.\n\nA Block Size Limit Increase Hard Fork\n\nThe last scaling improvement on Adam Back’s proposed roadmap for scaling Bitcoin is an increase to the block size limit via a hard fork. This is a protocol change that has been at the heart of alternative Bitcoin clients such as Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic.\n\nBy increasing the amount of data that can be placed into a block, the number of transactions allowed on the network also rises. Adam Back was unsure if this hard-forking change would be for a simple doubling of the block size limit or a more flexible, adaptive block size solution. Back explained, “Another potential is a kind of flexible size, so a block size that can grow over time automatically — maybe reacting to demand in some way.”\n\nThe Lightning Network\n\nWhile all of these improvements are being implemented on Bitcoin’s base layer, various layer-2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, can also happen in parallel. The Lightning Network only needs CHECKSEQUENCYVERIFY (along with two other related BIPs) and Segregated Witness to be accepted by the network before it can become a reality on top of the main Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThere are currently four or five companies, such as Blockstream and Lightning, working on their own implementations of the Lightning Network. Most of this development is taking place in an open-source manner on GitHub and a Lightning Network development mailing list.\n\nIn the past, many have referred to Lightning Network transactions as off-chain transactions, but that definition doesn’t tell the whole story. Adam Back explained this point during his recent talk:\n\n“It’s important to point out that Lightning Network transactions are real, native Bitcoin transactions. Each and every Lightning transaction could be posted to the Bitcoin blockchain and is a valid transaction; it’s just that there is a caching mechanism that collapses them, so they don’t all need to be sent to the blockchain.”\n\nIn addition to the scaling implications for Bitcoin, the Lightning Network also enables instant, finalized transactions with, perhaps, near-zero fees. Lightning may also enable a variety of new micropayment-related use cases for Bitcoin.', ""There is a serious problem brewing on the internet. Everyone expects content to be free, content providers accept this, trying to make their way with a mix of selling advertising and profiling their customers. Many users turn to tools like Adblock to shut out unwanted interruptions, they use Do Not Track in an attempt to thwart profiling, and the truly focused will run tools like Script Safe, which permit them fine grained control over which sites they'll permit to send dynamic content.\n\nThose methods make for a cleaner, faster internet experience, but at the cost of starving content providers, perhaps fatally. Premium sites like Wired now sense ad blockers and show a few second tease of an article, then they shift to asking users to 'whitelist' ads on their site. If you're part of Wired's target demographic their ads are likely products you might purchase, but there is another nasty hazard that nobody who depends on ad sales wants to address.\n\nThere are so many attacks that originate on ad sites that there is even a new word to describe this – malvertising. If you agree to whitelist a content site, you're permitting not just their material, but also all of the ad sites, and you'll have to accept Javascript. This language is used for programs that must run within your browser, and in the hands of a bad guy it's the vehicle for attacking vulnerable browsers.\n\nBrave, a new browser by a team led by no less than Brendan Eich, the creator of the Javascript language and cofounder of Firefox browser maker Mozilla, is about to change everything. The blockchain is the heart of this new system.\n\nThe goal is to only have good ads. We want fewer ads that are much more relevant, and we make sure the ads come after all the content, not before. - Brendan Eich\n\nRight now all you can get from Brave is the browser itself, but it's well worth downloading and installing on its own. Ads are blocked, as are tracking pixels. Tracking cookies are discarded, and the browser attempts to get the sites you visit to use encrypted https rather than simply accepting unencrypted http. All of these are worthy goals, but they don't fix the problem of your favorite indy news site needing a revenue stream to remain afloat.\n\nBrave's plan to address that problem involves an innovative use of the blockchain and a stub for the solution is already visible in the browser, in the form of the Bravery menu. There are three levels of service. Allow Ads is just what you think it would be, only with https enforced. Block Ads does everything tools like Adblock do and more. Replace Ads will soon let you see advertising from sources that Brave deems to be safe, and that are selected specifically for you based on tags that are derived from how you interact with your browser, rather than what advertisers choose to show you.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the Replace Ads function is that when you visit a site that you haven't selected to be ad free, the advertiser's payment is split between the site, Brave's system, and you."", ""The federal government has said it will implement the majority of the recommendations of a Senate committee report that called for major changes to the treatment of bitcoin and similar digital currencies.\n\nA key recommendation of the Senate inquiry's report was that the GST treatment of bitcoin be changed to avoid the current ‘double taxation’ that occurs because of the Australian Taxation Office’s assessment that bitcoin transactions are currently a form of barter due to the definition of money.\n\nThe government has already said it will take action on the GST issue and Treasury has recently begun seeking public input on how to change the law.\n\nThe Senate inquiry’s report also recommended that the review of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, which commenced in December 2013, consider extending Australia’s AML/CTF regulations to digital currency exchanges (in a similar fashion to how conventional currency exchange businesses are treated).\n\nIn its public response to the committee report, that government indicated it supported the recommendation.\n\n“Internationally, it is considered that the extension of AML/CTF regulation to include convertible digital currency exchanges would encourage innovation and investment by ensuring service providers have greater certainty and security in their dealings with digital currency businesses, while reducing the money laundering and terrorism financing risks associated with this emerging technology,” the government’s response noted\n\n“This approach has already been taken by a number of jurisdictions including the United Kingdom and Canada, and is in line with the recently published Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Currencies issued by the Financial Action Task Force, the international standard-setting body for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.”\n\n“Australia’s review is considering these and alternative approaches to addressing the money laundering and terrorism financing risks posed by digital currencies,” it added.\n\n(The government’s response to the Senate inquiry is dated 5 May, and the AML/CTF review's report had already been made public by the time the response was released.)\n\nThe AML/CTF review backed changes to Australian law to make sure that digital currencies are covered by the country’s anti-money-laundering regime.\n\nBitcoin and similar currencies currently sit outside the regime’s scope.

05/06/2016,"['It appears that once again, the technological genie has been unleashed from its bottle. Summoned by an unknown person or persons at an uncertain time in history, the genie is now at our service for another kick at the can—to transform the economic power grid and the old order of human affairs for the better.\n\nWe’re not talking about the social web, artificial intelligence, big data, robotics or even self-driving cars. We’re talking about the blockchain, the technology behind digital currencies like Bitcoin. Block. Chain. OK, not the most sonorous word ever– it sounds like a combination of blocking and tackling and chain gang. Sonorous or not, this technology represents nothing less than the second generation of the Internet, and it holds the potential to transform money, business, government and society. Let us explain.\n\nRead more: The One Big Reason Why It Matters Who Invented Bitcoin\n\nWhen you send someone information like an email, PDF, PPT or JPG, you’re really sending a copy not the original. Depending on the rights granted to recipients, they may be able to print a copy of these files. But under no circumstances should you print, say, money. So with the Internet of information we have to rely on powerful intermediaries to establish trust. Banks, governments and even social media companies like Facebook work to establish our identity and ownership of assets. They help us transfer value and settle transactions.\n\nOverall, they do a pretty good job—with limitations. They use centralized servers, which can be hacked. They take a fee for their services—say 10% to send money internationally. They capture our data, not just preventing us from monetizing it, but often undermining our privacy. They are sometimes unreliable and often slow. They exclude two billion people who don’t have enough money to justify a bank account. In sum, they capture a lopsided share of the benefits of the digital economy.\n\nEnter the blockchain, the first native digital medium for peer-to-peer value exchange. Its protocol establishes the rules—in the form of globally distributed computations and heavy duty encryption—that ensure the integrity of the data traded among billions of devices without going through a trusted third party. Trust is hard-coded into the platform. That’s why we call it the Trust Protocol. It acts as a ledger of accounts, a database, a notary, a sentry and clearing house, all by consensus.\n\nWhy should you care? Maybe you’re a music lover who wants artists to make a living off their art. Perhaps you’re an immigrant who’s sick of paying big fees on remittances. Maybe you’re an aid worker who needs to identify landowners so you can rebuild their homes after an earthquake. Or a citizen fed up with the lack of transparency and accountability of politicians. Or a social media user who thinks the data you generate might be worth something—to you. Even as we write, innovators are building blockchain-based applications that serve these ends. And they are just the beginning.\n\nEvery business, institution, government and individual can benefit in profound ways. The blockchain is already disrupting the financial services industry.\n\nHow about the corporation, a pillar of modern capitalism? With this global peer-to-peer platform for identity, reputation and transactions, we will be able to re-engineer deep structures of the firm for innovation and shared value creation.\n\nHow about these billions of connected smart things that will be sensing, responding, sharing data, generating and trading their own electricity, protecting our environment, managing our homes and our health? And this Internet of Everything will need a Ledger of Everything.\n\nAnd how about growing social inequality? Through the blockchain, we can go from redistributing wealth to distributing value and opportunity fairly in the first place, from cradle to grave.\n\nAs with all major paradigm shifts, there will be winners and losers. But if we do this right, blockchain technology can usher in a halcyon age of prosperity for all.', 'Vinny Lingham is the CEO of identity startup Civic, and the former founder of mobile gift card platform Gyft.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Lingham explains why he believes the price of bitcoin is headed higher, even if this won\'t be the direct result of the network\'s reward halving this year. The post is a follow-up to his widely circulated opposing prediction, issued in 2014.\n\nAfter reading my post Finding Equilibrium, published in March 2014, one could argue that I was a bit bearish on bitcoin – believing that it would trade sideways and down until certain fundamentals were in place.\n\nAt that point, most people inside the community expected bitcoin to retest its previous high of $1,255 in 2013 and easily break $2,000. In fact, when I surveyed the audience at CoinSummit in 2014, barely anyone would take the contrarian view. I did, and this was coming from the same person who correctly predicted that bitcoin would hit $1,000 just the year before.\n\nTo summarize my previous post, I argued the following:\n\nA lack of trust in exchanges would limit bitcoin purchasing\n\nBitcoin is not a currency, but a commodity (it has since been declared as such by numerous bodies, including the CFTC)\n\nLoss of momentum (Bitcoin was on the way down, not up)\n\nMainstream consumer adoption was lagging (and it still is to a large extent)\n\nMerchant adoption was outpacing consumer demand\n\nMiner margins were being squeezed (forcing more coins to be sold)\n\n""Smart Contracts"" would be a particularly important use case for the bitcoin network.\n\nHow 25 months makes a difference in the world of technology!\n\nIf we examine the points above, the following changes are clearly visible:\n\nBitcoin is on the way up, creating upward price momentum\n\nMerchant adoption has slowed (as a percentage) and consumers are catching up – mainly early adopters, but the delta between the two has virtually reversed\n\nMiner margins are looking a lot more more healthy, from the lows of $200 last year\n\nSmart contracts have become the latest buzzword, along with ""blockchain"" and other networks such as Ethereum\n\nThere is a strong trust in exchanges and platforms for purchasing bitcoin, such as Bitstamp, which recently got EU regulatory approval, as well as Coinbase, Kraken, Circle, BitX and others.\n\nHeadwinds approaching\n\nOn the basis of my previous arguments against the price rising, I believe the headwinds that were holding back bitcoin will take the price up to the $1,000 mark, this year.\n\nAs the title to this post suggests, there has been an awakening.\n\nI’ve casually been speaking about some tailwinds for about a year now and some of these ideas have been gaining momentum, so I wanted to summarize them here into three categories:\n\nIndustrial use cases are coming to the fore\n\n\n\nVenture capital has been pouring into blockchain and bitcoin startups at an unprecedented rate, now topping over $1bn. These startups are building out solutions which utilize blockchain technologies in industries where solutions were either not possible or financially viable.\n\nThe banking sector is investing heavily in what it calls ""blockchain"", but is specifically avoiding using bitcoin. I personally think the tide will turn on this point, as soon as one of these projects get compromised, from a security perspective. That said, many foreign banks are investigating and using the bitcoin blockchain for innovating around their processes.\n\nI think we have to accept that we will live in a world where there is a ""chain of chains"", all interlinked in some way. Bitcoin may not rule the chains of the finance world, but it may act as an intermediary platform for cross-chain settlement.\n\nThe coming short squeeze\n\n\n\nThe most important driver of the pending price surge, in my opinion, is going to be what I term as the ""mother&*!er of all short squeezes"".\n\nA short squeeze is basically what happens when people that are short selling an asset discover that the price has risen and they need to buy (cover) to ensure they do not make further losses.\n\nIn the bitcoin world, this happens under a number of scenarios.\n\nTraders and speculators who have taken a view that the bitcoin price will go lower could borrow coins via exchanges and sell those coins into the market, waiting for the price to drop to buy them back cheaper, repay the exchange and make a profit.\n\nMiners would normally want to lock in profits through ""hedging"", because they produce enough coins per day that they are able to pay out of their future production. However, halving day is approaching.\n\nHalving day is the day that a certain block number is reached and the rewards per block are cut in half (to 12.5 BTC per block, from the current 25 BTC). This is expected to take place in early July of this year.\n\nThis poses a problem for miners if they are trying to lock in their profits right now by borrowing and selling coins, which they intend to repay after halving day. Unless they have spare bitcoins lying around, they will be forced to buy coins on the open market if they cannot produce enough through their mining operations.\n\nIt’s the same as selling crops in the futures market and then being hit by a storm that wipes out half of your fields. The only way, technically, that this doesn’t happen, is if the price doubles on halving day (it won’t).\n\nBecause bitcoin trades at the margin (which means that only a percentage of the total coins issued are traded), there is less liquidity and extreme changes like a 50% drop in the rewards per block will have a more marked impact on the price than one would expect, triggering a short squeeze.\n\nOne would argue that the market has already factored this in, but it hasn’t. The reason is that the hash rate will fluctuate very rapidly over the halving day period, and that is going to cause a lot of volatility for miners and traders. Also, the true deflationary rate of bitcoin is not known, as I will now explain.\n\nReal inflation vs nominal inflation\n\n\n\nBitcoin was created as ""deflationary"" currency. The total supply is 21m units and it will never be changed. There are about 15.5m BTC in circulation and about 3,600 new coins minted per day, so roughly 100,000/coins per month, which amounts to nominal inflation (relative to actual coins issued) of around 8% per year.\n\nThis will arguably drop to 4% after halving day. Or will it?\n\nIf we assume that 4m BTC will not move anytime soon, then the active circulation of bitcoin is closer to 12m coins (based upon coins in issue today). Assuming that we are minting 100,000 bitcoins per month, then real inflation is at 10%, not 8%. So, if halving day takes effect, then real inflation drops to around 5%/year.\n\nBased upon research by John Ratcliff, I’d like to construct a new view of the real inflation rate of bitcoin. For various reasons, it appears that 25% of bitcoins are not in active circulation (lost, cold storage, Satoshi, etc). This is even if we assume Craig Wright is Satoshi (which would mean his coins won’t move until 2020). All numbers are rounded.\n\nIn 2014, bitcoin nominal inflation was 10.3% and real inflation was 15.1%\n\nIn 2015, bitcoin nominal inflation was 9.3% and real inflation was 10.1%\n\nIn 2016, bitcoin inflation will be 6.4% and real inflation will be 8.7%\n\nIn 2017, bitcoin inflation will be 4% and real inflation will be 5.3%.\n\nInflation in bitcoin has an interestingly different application than inflation in the real world, in that prices aren’t going up because governments are printing money. Prices are going up because of scarcity (supply/demand).\n\nIf you note that real ""inflation"" is dropping nearly two-thirds in around just three years, it means that for the current volume of bitcoin buying to be satisfied, bitcoin will need to find a new, and higher equilibrium point and clearing price.\n\nI don’t think these calculations have been adequately factored into the market price.\n\nComing arms race\n\nThe realization that bitcoin is a strategic global asset will trigger an ""arms race"".\n\nCurrently, the market cap of bitcoin ($7bn) is simply too small to facilitate a large buy of bitcoins from any governmental organization. If bitcoin started to surge globally, it could become of strategic interest to a government, and therefore other governments. I believe this would trigger something akin to a digital commodity race.\n\nImagine if China started buying up large amounts of bitcoin – would the rest of the world governments stand idly by and watch? I don’t think so – so my prediction here is that by 2017, governments will become the largest buyers of bitcoin, pushing the price up to new highs.\n\nIt’s always easy to make outlandish predictions. My goal for this post was to outline what I think the tailwinds are behind bitcoin.\n\nI don’t know if the price is going to $1,000 or $10,000 – but I do know that it is going up. If I was forced to predict, I would say that it would hit $1000+ in 2016 and $3000+ in 2017.\n\nLooking forward to seeing how this all plays out!\n\nThis post was originally published on Medium and has been republished with the author\'s permission.\n\nBusiness awakening via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Following the announcement, Gemini simply joins the list of many. However, the US Bitcoin exchange has become the first licensed digital currency trading platform to support Ethereum trading.\n\nIn a statement to Bloomberg, the twins were quoted saying –\n\n“Their (NYSDFS) approval of Gemini as the first-ever licensed platform to support Ether trading demonstrates their commitment to being global thought leaders in financial regulation that both protects customers and fosters innovation.”\n\nHowever, they seem to have forgotten to factor in the fact that many digital currency platforms have already implemented ether trading. It has already made them the leaders in “innovation” as the brothers have put it. Also, the whole reason behind bitcoin was to keep the governments and other institutions at arm’s length when it comes to individuals’ finances.\n\nMany digital currency businesses – doing perfectly well – have already mentioned that the strict BitLicense regime is not really conducive to innovation and growth of cryptocurrency industry. It is worth remembering that the introduction of BitLicense led to a mass exodus of some of the notable cryptocurrency platforms from New York.\n\nCurrently, there are only a handful of Bitcoin companies that are operating in the state by gaining BitLicense approval. Many, on the other hand, has left the scene citing unaffordable regulatory and compliance fees to obtain the license.\n\nWith Gemini introducing Ethereum support, the residents of the State of New York will at least have access to a regulated digital currency exchange where they can trade popular cryptocurrencies in addition to Bitcoin.\n\nMeanwhile, the popularity of ether is only expected to grow upwards, thanks to various applications of the Ethereum protocol, which is now being increasingly adopted by banking and financial institutions in their operations.\n\nRef: Bloomberg Technology Image: NewsBTC', 'The process of getting all of the paperwork and legal documentation together is both time-consuming, and costly. But that is not the biggest concern, as BitLicense requires companies to keep an extensive amount of details on all of their customers.\n\nTwo more companies are on the brink of obtaining the infamous Bitlicense, which makes Coinbase and Ripple compliant Bitcoin entities in the state of New York. Both companies applied for their license several months ago, but it looks like there is light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nBitLicense for Coinbase and Ripple on the Horizon\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the matter, both Ripple and Coinbase will receive their BitLicense in the very near future. A notice has also appeared on the NYDFS website stating they received applications from both companies, which is usually only done once all of the necessary paperwork has been completed.\n\nAlthough it remains to be seen when both companies will receive the BitLicense- if they will at all, that is – things are looking up for Ripple and Coinbase enthusiasts. The state of New York invented the BitLicense regulatory guidelines last year, as they want to scrutinize Bitcoin companies even more than most other financial institutions in the state.\n\nIn doing so, New York became the first – and for now, only – US state to take such drastic measures against Bitcoin companies. Most enterprises did not take kindly to these regulations, and no longer offer their service in the state. The process of getting all of the paperwork and legal documentation together is both time-consuming and costly. But that is not the biggest concern, as BitLicense requires companies to keep an extensive amount of details on all of their customers.\n\nHowever, some companies – such as Coinbase and Ripple – have gone through the rigorous process of obtaining a BitLicense. Being fully compliant with all state and federal laws is pertinent for any company who wants to target the New York region. Coinbase is one of the world’s largest Bitcoin exchanges, and they have significant backing from various investors. Skipping out on the New York state is not an option for them by any means.\n\nThe same can be said for Ripple, as this alternative form of payments wants to partner with the world’s biggest financial institutions and companies. Having a presence in New York is an absolute must in this regard, and they applied for BitLicense under the corporate name of XRP II LLC. Keeping in mind how the Ripple service and currency are known under the XRP name; this does not come as a complete surprise.\n\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services has also approved the application of Gemini Trust Company yesterday, which seems to indicate the Bitcoin exchange will be getting their BitLicense very soon as well.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Charlie Morris, the investment director of the Fleet Street Letter, is buying bitcoin. He sees it as a cheap stock with an opportunity to grow in value because of the halving. Morris gave his reasons for being bullish on bitcoin in a column in the Fleet Street Letter, a MoneyWeek Research Publication in London, U.K.\n\nMorris compares the bitcoin halving to gold miners or oil producers cutting their production in half. He asks his readers if they would be more bullish on gold and oil if gold and oil supplies were cut in half. “That’s exactly what’s about to happen to bitcoin, the digital currency,” he noted.\n\nBitcoin: Limited Supply\n\nMorris wrote that 25 bitcoins are now created every 10 minutes. On July 11, this number drops to 12.5. Four years later, it halves again.\n\nThere are currently 15.5 million bitcoins at present and the halving process, which is written into the the cryptocurrency’s software’s code, restricts the supply of bitcoins to 21 million. The supply is expected to reach this limit in about a century.\n\nScarcity is a feature of bitcoin’s design. It is a feature that distinguishes the cryptocurrency from fiat currency, which can be produced in unlimited amounts.\n\nA Social Media Stock?\n\nWhile many people buy bitcoin for speculation, their bets will only prove advantageous if other people buy it for its utility. Hence, bitcoin can be viewed as a social media stock in that the more people use it, the greater its value.\n\nMorris described bitcoin as a digital asset that can move across the Internet. It differs from a traditional database in some important ways. With a traditional database, the user goes into the database, opens a file, changes the data and closes the file. Both the seller and the buyer have to do this, along with intermediaries. Because of all the parties involved, there is room for error in settlement.\n\nWith a blockchain, the transaction gets recorded onto a new layer of data called a block. That block never changes. A new block comes into existence every 10 minutes. The data stores in a chain of blocks known as a “blockchain.”\n\nBitcoin, contrary to what many people think, does not have a serial number. Instead, it has provenance.\n\nAlso read: Investment firm pegs BTC value at $655\n\nHow The Blockchain Works\n\nIn a bitcoin transaction, the system checks to make sure the bitcoin being spent hasn’t already been spent. The system checks this by examining the blockchain, where the transaction history records.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Bitcoin users in parts of Africa have an almost non-existent mining practice yet the virtual currency’s level of adoption is driving more Africans to its trade.\n\nAside from a Ghanaian firm, Ghana Dot Com (GDC), which claimed it has launched the first Bitcoin mining facility in Africa in March, most mining efforts in parts of Africa are usually done on an individual basis or crowd mining with little or no chance of profitability. This is due to several factors.\n\nPower problems\n\n“I don't think anyone's doing any mining,” says Tim Akinbo, CEO of Nigeria-based TimbaObjects to CoinTelegraph. “Not with the power situation in the country. I can't see how they intend to compete. Well, at least, if their objective is profitability.”\n\nYet, Akinbo, who helps new users acquire their first Bitcoins by directly selling to them or through online platforms for people he doesn’t know personally, was quick to indicate that Nigerians traded Bitcoin worth N7.4m (about US$37, 150) over a four-week period quoting localbitcoins.com.\n\nCo-founder of Umati Blockchain Ltd in Kenya, Michael Kimani, mined some Litecoins in 2013 using his fast internet connection on a Dell CPU but realized it wasn't profitable.\n\n“Difficulty levels had gone up and I was using an old Dell CPU. By that time, the mining space was crowding out,” he stated in a mail to CoinTelegraph citing the coming of ASICs and GPUs. “What I have observed from a Facebook Bitcoin community of Kenyans and from inquiries via email is that people ask how they can get started with mining. Some have bought mining shares on cloud mining services, or giga hashpowers on CEX.io. That's some of the feedback I've received. I can't say who else is mining out there, but I know a lot of early adopters are asking.”\n\nTrading volumes up\n\nHowever, he too admitted that the African trend in trading in the virtual currency has been encouraging.\n\n“Trading volumes are picking up on peer-to-peer exchange localbitcoins.com,” he said. “I was having a look at data today. Since 2015, over 130 million KES worth of bitcoins have been traded in the local currency, that’s about 2,600 BTC.”\n\nKimani conducted research on what's been driving demand peer-to-peer markets. The rise stems from the high demand from young people in the region, with most cases revolving around online payments. “Some of the reasons people buy Bitcoins are for depositing money into forex trading accounts which accept Bitcoin deposits. For them, it is quick, inexpensive and convenient to fund online wallets such as Solid Trust Pay, Neteller which accept Bitcoin for deposits within an hour.”\n\nHe also mentioned that some buy Bitcoins to make payments on freelancing sites like Fiverr, to pay freelancers who earn Bitcoins in exchange for the local currency and to pay for web hosting services, since “Kenyans are forward thinking progressives.”\n\n“For Nigeria, it is incoming remittances,” says Akinbo as a factor which drives Nigerian’s interest in Bitcoins. “People using Bitcoin to send money to Nigeria get a better exchange rate than those using the traditional banking network.”\n\nAkinbo says he also buys Bitcoins for personal use as a hedge against currency devaluation and for cross-border trade.\n\nThey both identify the volume of Bitcoin trade in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria as the largest on the continent and that there is a gap to be filled in African economies which are overly dependent on foreign currency as a means of settlement whether in online commerce, trade or remittances.\n\nChina’s Bitmain hatched a plan to expand over-the-counter Bitcoin trading in non-mature markets such as in Africa by investing $1.6 million in Bitcoin data and trading services provider, BitKan last month. However, to what extent this investment would impact the African Bitcoin trading market will soon be determined."", 'Leslie Starr O’Hara is a human who lives on a mini-farm in the mountains of North Carolina (Planet Earth) and the author of ""The Doublespeak Dictionary.""\n\nIn this feature, O\'Hara looks at some of the items already for sale on the recently launched bitcoin-based online market OpenBazaar.\n\nYou may have heard of OpenBazaar. It’s a new peer-to-peer marketplace where there are no rules or transaction fees, and all payments are made in bitcoin.\n\nSounds cool, right? But wait. Isn’t this like an underground black market enclave where drug kingpins do business with black-hat hackers and murderers for hire? Or, failing that, maybe it’s just full of over-your-head, techie stuff for basement-dwelling neckbeards? What can you actually buy there?\n\nTurns out, quite a lot. And while there are a few listings on OpenBazaar for things like cannabis seeds and peyote buttons, most of the offerings are quite tame – the kind of stuff you might buy at the big-box store in town, but first you’d have to put on pants, and then you’d have to use inflationary fiat currency to pay for it.\n\nThen you\'ll pay the consumer’s portion of the big box store’s tax-and-regulations bill. And who wants to do that?\n\nAs an added plus, hidden among the useful but ordinary items like cooking ingredients, T-shirts and cycling gear, there are a few unique gems that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else in the world.\n\nThis list attempts to spotlight examples of both types of listings – the items you probably already use, as well as the stuff you may have never heard of before.\n\nTo give the new OpenBazaar user a small taste of what this amazing market has to offer, only items priced at or below .02 bitcoins ($10) have been included.\n\n1. Yummy caramel waffles\n\nOne of the most wonderful things about a worldwide, peer-to-peer market is that you get to taste deliciousness from kitchens around the world. These traditional Dutch-recipe caramel waffles are shipped to Europe and North America by Croatian vendor Sweet Express.\n\nThe listing says the treats are baked fresh as soon as you order. You get 10 pieces for 0.0078 BTC (or a little over $3) plus shipping.\n\n2. A night’s stay in Taiwan\n\nWithin days after OpenBazaar’s launch, the first vacation rental listing went up. For the traveler on a budget, what could be better than the rental of a safe, secure sleeping capsule (with kitchen and bathroom privileges) in the heart of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for just 0.0231 bitcoins ($10) per night? Enter Bitcoin House Taiwan.\n\nAccording to the vendor, a “capsule” consists of a single, curtained bed with power outlet, USB charger, LED light and clothes hangers. The best part, though? The cool people who stay at the Bitcoin House.\n\n3. Super Hot Chili Seeds\n\nIf you love digging in the soil, you’ll definitely want to check out OpenBazaar. For a trade network in its infancy, OB has an astonishing number of vendors offering garden seeds and home-grown produce.\n\nThe photo above is of Bhut Jolokia (aka Nepalese Ghost Pepper), and is sold by Tygg’s Seedery of the Netherlands.\n\nThe seeds come 10 to a pack at 0.0078 bitcoins (about $3), and, although this is one of the hottest peppers in the world, the seller tells us the fruits have a ""nice taste of fruity papaya"".\n\n4. Handcrafted Lip Balm\n\nAnother category of items that seems to abound on OpenBazaar is personal care products. Most of these are all-natural and handcrafted.\n\nFor instance, this lip balm by US vendor Virus Media contains rich beeswax, coconut and other oils, and comes in three natural flavors: sweet orange, lemon, and peppermint.\n\nAt 0.0116 bitcoins($5), this lip balm makes an affordable and useful first purchase to test the waters on OpenBazaar.\n\n5. Cute Dress\n\nThis super-cute dress is only 0.0179 bitcoins (about $8) from US vendor Vintage Fashion. This seller has several other vintage dress listings as well.\n\nIn addition to Vintage Fashion, there are several t-shirt companies on OpenBazaar, as well as stores selling leather goods, hand-knit hats, and the latest in fashionable footwear.\n\n6. A Vintage Greeting Card From a Fictional Character\n\nThis listing is offered by what is probably one of the most eccentric stores on OpenBazaar thus far. Madam Macadam’s Curiosities specializes in “Mystery Boxes”, but the coolest thing about this vendor is that the listings form a sort of ongoing narrative of the life of Irma May Willikins, a fictional character from Victorian times.\n\nFor 0.0069 bitcoins ($3), Irma will send you a personalized vintage greeting card. After shopping with this OpenBazaar store, you’ll be wanting fascinating fiction with all of your purchases!\n\n7. This Awesome Angel Wings Silicone Mold\n\nFor cake decorating! Yes, there is actually a cake supply store on OpenBazaar. It’s practically like going to the mall already. Except you can shop naked. And pay in Bitcoin.\n\nSo, basically like the mall but a million times better. This mold runs .02 bitcoins (about $9) and is sold by US vendor Cake Supply World.\n\n8. Zombie Apocalypse Preparedness Patch\n\nPrepping can be emotionally difficult, because here you are buying all this cool stuff that’s going to save everybody’s ass during the zombie apocalypse/nuclear winter/supervolcano explosion/civil unrest/hyperinflation/gray goo scenario…but you can’t show any of it to anyone, because they might try to steal it from you when the stuff, or they might report you to the government. So frustrating.\n\nWell, this is one item that you can proudly display in public. And it’s only .01 bitcoins ($5). You can get it from U.S. vendor shinybadges.com.\n\n9. Citrus-Mint Beard Oil\n\nThe supply of beard oil has proliferated in the western market over the past year or so, with a variety of products for the discerning beard owner on display in supermarkets, apparel shops, and auto parts stores everywhere.\n\nBut, inexplicably, for the first few days after OpenBazaar went live, the marketplace suffered a dearth of fine beard products. No longer! Swedish vendor Hidden Road came to the rescue with this all-natural, organic beard oil. Men and bearded ladies across the network rejoiced. And you will, too.\n\nThis luxuriant oil will keep your facial hair looking dapper and smelling nice, and it’s only .02 bitcoins ($10) for a 1 oz bottle.\n\n10. OpenBazaar Pin\n\nYour first trip to the world’s first international, decentralized marketplace would hardly be complete without the purchase of a piece of OpenBazaar memorabilia.\n\nThis set of two pins is only 0.0208 bitcoins ($9), and it’s a great way to show your support for the project and its developers.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nIf you’re not already on OpenBazaar, you can download it here. (It’s a very quick download followed by a painless onboarding process, and then you’re free to begin perusing listings, or you can create a store and post your own items for sale with no rules or fees.)\n\nThis article originally appeared on Medium and has been republished with the author\'s permission.\n\nImages via OpenBazaar\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Even if you understand that it’s a secure cryptocurrency, the steps needed to acquire and keep track of Bitcoin can be daunting. Then finding people who you can use the digital currency with is another hurdle.\n\niPayYou aims to solve both of those problems. The new Bitcoin wallet service, launched this week, makes it easy to store Bitcoin and send it to friends, even if they don’t have a wallet set up yet.\n\nThe Seattle-based startup was founded in 2015 by Gene Kavner, who was previously the worldwide director of the Amazon Associates program and principal architect for display advertising at Microsoft.\n\n“When the internet was just starting up, it was extremely complex,” Kavner said. “You’d go to a website and you’d say ‘Now what? What do I do next?’ There were very few things you could do. We’re in a very similar stage with Bitcoin and the blockchain.”\n\nKavner’s solution makes Bitcoin more transparent. Users see how much Bitcoin they have in dollars, so they can tell if it’s enough to buy a loaf of bread or a boat. They also get a clear list of transactions and can even recall transactions if they’ve been sent in error.\n\niPayYou also provides a more accessible face to Bitcoin. When sending those simple dollar amounts, you don’t need to know a complex address, which is up to 35 characters long and a mix of numbers and letters. Instead, iPayYou takes care of remembering all that and you just select the friend you want to send money to.\n\nBut the real power behind iPayYou is the ability to send Bitcoin to people who haven’t yet gotten into the cryptocurrency. Previously, the recipient had to already have a system in place for accepting Bitcoin before you paid in Bitcoin.\n\n“People are sending Bitcoin to each other in these very cryptic addresses,” Kavner said. “We want one person to be able to send Bitcoin to another person without forcing that recipient to pre-create an address for themselves.”\n\nWe want one person to be able to send Bitcoin to another person without forcing that recipient to pre-create an address for themselves. iPayYou’s launch comes at a time of significant interest in the cryptocurrency. This week, the purported creator of the system has claimed responsibility, only to withhold evidence backing up his claim. But Bitcoin has stabilized substantially since its 2013 peak, when valuations neared $1,000 per Bitcoin.\n\nKavner said that the currency has ditched its day-trader image and is now much more reliable. One Bitcoin is around $460 today and has grown beyond a buy-low-sell-high strategy. Users can checkout with Bitcoin on Overstock.com or even pay a bar tab with it thanks to Seattle startup HotSpot.\n\nWith iPayYou, the currency can now be used to pay your friends. The company is also looking to add a gift card option, so you can effectively use Bitcoin at stores that don’t actually accept the currency.\n\nRight now, iPayYou exists as a web app, but Kavner’s team is working on an iOS and Android app as well. The Seattle-based company currently has five employees and is self funded, but Kavner said he plans to start raising funds now that the product is on the market.', 'A bilateral research initiative sees Germany and Austria funding the project which is focused on organized financial crime specifically committed with virtual currencies.\n\nThe project, titled ‘BITCRIME’ will see funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Austrian Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT).\n\nThe project will see a total of €2.4 million (approx. $2.75 million) and will span a total of 25 months.\n\nCiting the growth of the use of virtual currencies which are independent of central banks or other authorities, the project’s homepage states that virtual currencies are hence “attractive” to those partaking in organized financial crime. The “challenge” also sees prevention and prosecution strategies as “lacking”.\n\nAn excerpt from the project’s goal reads:\n\nThe joint project will assess the subject [of virtual currencies] and its threat profile in order to develop innovative and workable approaches toward regulating virtual currencies in a way that is compatible with their fundamental nature. The project will strive to develop actionable, internationally applicable and interoperable solutions for Europe and beyond.\n\nNew Approaches for Tackling Bitcoin-based Crime\n\nNotably, the project makes the distinction that all Bitcoin transactions are public on the blockchain, which thereby “allows for the development of new approaches”, which is ostensibly where the project will focus on.\n\nThe project sees a number of partners from Germany and Austria and is divided between two subprojects between the countries.\n\nThe German Subproject\n\nThe German subproject will focus on the development of “technical and organizational approaches” to foster effective criminal investigation. Regulatory approaches that will safeguard legitimate users of Bitcoin and virtual currencies while preventing crime will also be prioritized.\n\nInterestingly, a test environment will be developed to simulate a virtual currency wherein researchers will study common characteristics of illegal transactions in an effort to identify them in the real world. The research and knowledge gained from the effort will then be demonstrated and tested in a proof-of-concept environment.\n\nAltogether, the German side of the bilateral project will see the majority of the funding, at €1.8 million.\n\nThe Austrian subproject\n\nOver in Austria, the approach will see a focus on the analysis of patterns in criminal financial transactions. Research will also canvass “adjacent ecosystems” that will keep an eye on social media and platforms like the Darknet.\n\nThe goal is to identify and de-anonymize criminals, as a result of the sweeping effort that combines information research from transactional, social media and Darknet analysis, the project revealed.\n\nThe Austrian subproject will see a volume of €635,000 in funding.\n\nThe project comes at a time when the European Parliament has proposed a task force for virtual currencies. A recent vote in the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee of the European Parliament is also pushing for the Anti-Money Laundering Directive to include digital currency exchanges under its purview.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

He is scheduled to appear in a New York federal court on Tuesday.\n\nThe full story of how the lifelong educator came to be caught up in a world of cybercriminals is still not fully known.\n\nBut one thing has become apparent: His downfall came with his increasing involvement in the business affairs of his son, Anthony Murgio, who the elder Murgio supported financially for years and with whom he is now accused of conspiring to bribe a New Jersey bank official.\n\nStart at FSU fraternity\n\nIt was Anthony Murgio, federal prosecutors say, who fell in with a ring of cybercriminals linked to colleagues from his college days at Florida State University.\n\nAnd it was Anthony Murgio who launched a money-exchange company that federal prosecutors say laundered cash for Internet criminals and facilitated online extortion schemes.\n\nAfter spending time unemployed and dependent on an allowance from his father, Anthony Murgio began making trips to Russia and, investigators say, colluding with the man who masterminded the historic hack of JPMorgan Chase in 2014.\n\nAnthony is now 32, but the roots of his current legal problems appear to have formed a decade earlier, in a fraternity house in Tallahassee.\n\nLong before he came into the sights of federal investigators, Anthony Murgio was a popular, self-styled self-starter. The son of two prominent educators – his mother is former Dreyfoos School of the Arts Principal Amelia Ostrosky – he developed an early interest in coin-collecting and was a wide receiver and sprinter at Palm Beach Gardens High School.\n\nAt Florida State University he was elected president of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, which he later bragged he converted from “a no-name fraternity to one of the top fraternities in four years’ time.”\n\nAs a college student, Anthony spent time selling Cutco knives door to door, claiming later on his personal website that he made “tons of money for a college kid.”\n\nBut he said his life took an even more profitable turn when a frat brother named Joshua Aaron “showed me the ropes to online marketing.”\n\nWith Aaron’s guidance, Anthony says he started his own online marketing company. It was, he said, a smashing success. On his website he said that he was soon “flown all over the world, taken out to dinners all day and night.”\n\nHe graduated in 2007 with a marketing degree. From online marketing he branched into running eateries and nightspots. He soon was an owner of three Tallahassee venues: the 101 Restaurant, Club Mint and Versailles wine lounge.\n\nIn 2010, at age 26, Anthony Murgio was picked by Tallahassee Magazine as one of the “Top Singles of Tallahassee.” He drove a leased 2010 Mercedes Benz E350.\n\nSon’s bankruptcy denied\n\nBut whatever his outward signs of success, financial problems soon followed.\n\nIn April 2012, he filed for personal bankruptcy. He had been forced to sell off his restaurants, and his online marketing company couldn’t afford to pay its employees, he admitted in a court deposition.\n\nHe was broke, he claimed, and dependent on a $2,000-a-month allowance from his parents to make ends meet.\n\nHis financial problems were followed by legal ones. His bankruptcy petition was rejected after a judge concluded that he had tried to conceal at least $4,000 a month in income from subleasing condos. Anthony Murgio, the judge later wrote, had “knowingly made false statements under oath.”\n\nIn 2013 he was arrested on charges that he withheld $110,000 in sales tax collections from the state and was briefly booked into the Palm Beach County Jail.\n\nIf it looked like a long fall from grace, it was only the beginning.\n\nWithin a few months he was plotting a new endeavor – one that would ultimately ensare both him and his father in a massive federal probe.\n\nIn July 2013, Anthony registered a company called Collectables Club with the Florida Department of State. As the registered address he put his father’s home, a 4,300-square-foot house on a golf course west of Palm Beach Gardens.\n\nHe told banks that processed his transactions that the Collectables Club was a members-only group set up to buy and sell antiques, old coins and sports memorabilia, prosecutors say.\n\nBut prosecutors say it was a front company, one to mask the operations of an unlicensed money-transfer company called Coin.mx.\n\nThe company’s true purpose, they alleged: exchanging cash for bitcoins, a digital, difficult-to-trace currency.\n\nBy then, Anthony Murgio had long been an outspoken supporter of libertarian principles — his Facebook profile includes a photo of him with libertarian icon and former Texas Congressman Ron Paul — and his embrace of bitcoin jibed with the libertarian urge for commerce unimpeded by government regulation.\n\n‘Founding father’ of Coin.mx\n\nHe set up the company’s operations with help from a fellow FSU grad, Yuri Lebedev, who was recruited in September 2013. In an email obtained by the FBI, Lebedev confided that he hoped to be the “founding father and the architect” of Coin.mx’s online operations, and authorities say he worked to obtain Internet servers and programmers for the outfit.\n\nBut prosecutors say both men worked for someone else: an Israeli named Gery Shalon, who federal officials allege was the owner of Coin.mx.\n\nBy the time the bitcoin operation was running, authorities say Shalon was years into his operating of a sprawling cybercrime ring.\n\nAuthories allege that Shalon’s sprawling network carried out the widely publicized hack of JPMorgan Chase’s customer data in 2014, using it to facilitate a massive “pump-and-dump” scheme to artificially inflate the price of penny stocks and then sell them at high profits.\n\nThe precise nature of Anthony’s relationship with Shalon is not clear. But an apparent link was Joshua Aaron, Anthony’s old frat brother and former marketing mentor.\n\nAaron, prosecutors say, was one of Shalon’s co-conspirators in the massive hacking ring. Investigators call him a lead operator of the pump-and-dump scheme that Shalon masterminded, an operation that purportedly earned them millions of dollars. He also provided login credentials to hackers carrying out the attacks, authorities allege.\n\nYears after their days at FSU, Aaron and Anthony Murgio were still close friends, and Anthony acknowledged on his personal website that they continued to collaborate.\n\nBuddies meet in Russia\n\nLast year, a social media post showed the old friends meeting again in Russia\n\nIt was an auspicious rendevous point. The cyberattacks on JPMorgan were believed to have been carried out with help from Russian hackers, and Anthony Murgio’s visits there appeared to coincide with at least two computer breaches linked to Shalon’s ring, Bloomberg News reported last year.\n\nAaron, at that point, was deep into his work as Shalon’s front man in the pump-and-dump scheme, prosecutors allege in court records.\n\nAnthony Murgio, prosecutors say, was hard at work for Shalon, too.\n\nBetween October 2013 and January 2015, Coin.mx exchanged a total of $1.8 million in cash for bitcoins for tens of thousands of customers under Anthony Murgio’s oversight, authorities allege.\n\nAmong the company’s alleged clients: victims of online extortions known as “ransomware,” in which malicious computer software seizes control of a computer and threatens to destroy files unless the owner agrees to pay a ransom.\n\nThe ransom is often required to be paid in bitcoins, and prosecutors say Anthony Murgio knowingly provided bitcoins to victims looking to save their computers, facilitating “the transfer of ransom proceeds to the malware operators.”\n\nThough he is accused of trying to shield the company’s transactions from regulators and bank officials, he did little to conceal the company publicly.\n\nOn his Facebook page, Anthony Murgio posted news about Coin.mx and alerted friends in February 2014 that he was trying to hire a social media manager for the company.\n\nAs Coin.mx began doing hundreds of thousands of dollars in transactions, prosecutors say he and Lebedev searched for a way to conceal the scope of their operation.\n\nDad had little grasp of bitcoins\n\nFor assistance, prosecutors say they turned to Anthony’s father. By then, Mike Murgio was more than a year into his first term on the school board.\n\nMike Murgio was aware of his son’s bitcoin business, but his attorney says he had little grasp of how the digital currency worked.\n\nAs he saw his son increasingly drawn into a trade that took him on overseas trips to meet with mysterious figures, attorney Stuart Kaplan said, Mike Murgio warned his son to be careful.\n\n“There is no doubt that his son developed relationships with some people overseas in Russia who Mike absolutely had no contact with or involvement with,” Kaplan said. “Mike on a number of occasions told Anthony, ‘I hope you know who these people are and what they’re about.’”\n\nWhile the extent of Mike Murgio’s knowledge of the bitcoin outfit is not clear, prosecutors say he helped his son conceal its massive financial transactions by taking control of a small credit union in New Jersey.\n\nTheir alleged strategy entailed $150,000 in bribes to a man named Trevon Gross, a pastor who served as chairman of the Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union in Jackson, N.J., which catered to low-income residents.\n\nIn April 2014, authorities say Mike Murgio negotiated an agreement with Gross that allowed his son to nominate people to credit union’s board of directors. Payments from Anthony and Lebedev soon followed, they say, and former FSU classmates assumed positions on the board.\n\nAuthorities say Anthony Murgio then used the credit union as “a captive bank” to operate Coin.mx.\n\nWant ad for CEO on Facebook\n\nAgain, he and his friends did little to conceal their actions. Lebedev posted his role on the bank’s board on his online LinkedIn account, as did at least one other friend of Anthony Murgio.\n\nIn October, Anthony Murgio announced on his Facebook page that he was looking for a CEO to appoint.\n\n“Anyone interested in running a credit union in New Jersey?” he asked in the online posting. “We are looking for a CEO.”\n\nThings began unwinding less than a year later.\n\nIn July 2015, less than a month after Anthony Murgio posted a photo of himself in Moscow on his Facebook page, he and Lebedev were arrested in Florida in connection with Coin.mx.\n\nMurgio, in the Tampa area at the time, was taken to the Pinellas County Jail, where he stayed for three days before being released on bond.\n\nOn the lam in Russia\n\nAt the same time, Israeli authorities arrested Shalon and another alleged accomplice. Aaron, said to live in Tel Aviv but traveling in Russia, escaped arrest.\n\nAt the time, none of the charges specifically mentioned the JPMorgan hack. But federal authorities made it clear that closing that case was their end-game.\n\n“The next step will be for the FBI to arrest these guys, have them flip and cooperate and maybe start having the conversation about JPMorgan,” a person familiar with the case told The Washington Post in July. “You’re using these charges as a hammer, something to hold over their head.”\n\nIn four months’ time, prosecutors decided they had enough evidence to charge Shalon and Aaron in connection with the hack of JPMorgan and several other financial companies and media outlets. Both were hit with the new charges in November, although Aaron remained at large.\n\nAuthorities say the hacking ring’s intent was to use banking clients’ email addresses in order to send them spam emails promoting penny stocks. The alleged goal: to find enough buyers to drive up the stocks’ prices, then unload them at large profits.\n\nHundreds of people involved\n\nThe scheme, masterminded by Shalon, also included illegal gambling websites, prosecutors said. All told, hundreds of people were said to be involved.\n\nThough Mike Murgio’s involvement appeared to be limited, prosecutors say it was enough to amount to bribery. He now faces federal charges of making corrupt payments with intent to influence an officer of a financial institution.\n\nKaplan, his attorney, said his client may be “collateral damage” in the FBI’s attempt to gather more evidence about Shalon.\n\n“Obviously a great way to attempt to put pressure on them is to arrest a loved one and try to see if that’s going to be enough to break them,” said Kaplan, a former FBI agent. “I think that the government will use whatever resources are available and whatever techniques are available to make their case.”\n\nAaron is at large and believed to be hiding out in Russia. He is on the list of the FBI’s Top 10 most wanted cybercriminals. Mike Murgio, his political career dashed, will travel to New York to appear in court Tuesday.\n\nAnthony Murgio has been out of jail since last summer, when his mother offered her condo as collateral to post his bond.\n\nHe did not respond to a request for comment for this story but remains active on social media. “Trusting people is my Achilles heel,” he writes on his personal website. “More to come on what the real story is in a bit.”\n\nA judge has ruled that he is free to travel in Florida and New York, to look for a job.', 'Bitcóin, una plataforma de dinero electrónico que divide opiniones entre quienes la ven como una alternativa brillante al sistema monetario actual y quienes la creen una herramienta para financiar actividades ilegales, está rodeada de misterio.\n\nDesde 2008, el seudónimo Satoshi Nakamoto ha estado ligado a su visionario creador, pero la identidad del hombre de carne y hueso sigue en entredicho.

A secretive genius develops a technology that changes the world, develops a cult-like following and becomes fabulously wealthy in the process, without a soul knowing who he, or she, is.\n\nBitcoin, unveiled by the pseudonymous Nakamoto (more commonly known as Satoshi) to an obscure internet mailing list eight years ago, now fascinates the world.\n\nAn independent, decentralised virtual currency, practically impervious to fraud or theft and with no transaction fees, it promised to liberate money in the same way that the world wide web made information free. The technology is widely accepted as brilliant: the value of all the bitcoins in circulation now totals almost £5bn, and the blockchain technology that backs it up is being studied by every major bank.\n\nSince Bitcoin truly entered the popular consciousness three years ago, thousands of hours have been put into unmasking its creator, with several false reckonings. The frenzy peaked in 2014, when Newsweek’s claim to have outed a 64-year-old Japanese American man, Dorian Nakamoto, as Satoshi culminated in a high-speed car chase along a California motorway, with the exposé’s unsuspecting subject fleeing a media scrum.\n\nFrom Bitcoin’s earliest days, whoever created the technology clearly had no intention of becoming a public figure: despite the promise of instant fame and recognition, the last we heard from Satoshi was an internet post back in 2011.\n\nThat is unless you believe the word of an Australian computer scientist named Craig Wright, who last week came forward claiming he was Satoshi. Wright presented his apparent proof to the BBC, The Economist and GQ, and to two experts – the Bitcoin Foundation’s chief scientist Gavin Andresen and Jon Matonis, a founding director.', 'As early as 1981, inventors were attempting to solve the Internet’s problems of privacy, security, and inclusion with cryptography. No matter how they reengineered the process, there were always leaks because third parties were involved. Paying with credit cards over the Internet was insecure because users had to divulge too much personal data, and the transaction fees were too high for small payments. In 1998, Nick Szabo wrote a short paper entitled “The God Protocol.” Szabo mused about the creation of a be-all end-all technology protocol, one that designated God the trusted third party in the middle of all transactions. His point was powerful: Doing business on the Internet requires a leap of faith.\n\nA decade later in 2008, the global financial industry crashed. Perhaps propitiously, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto–who may or may not be an Australian entrepreneur named Craig Wright–outlined a new protocol for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system using a cryptocurrency, or digital currency, called Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are different from traditional fiat currencies because they are not created or controlled by countries. This protocol established a set of rules—in the form of distributed computations—that ensured the integrity of the data exchanged among these billions of devices without going through a trusted third party. This seemingly subtle act set off a spark that has excited, terrified, or otherwise captured the imagination of the computing world and has spread like wildfire everywhere.\n\nCover image, Blockchain Revolution Courtesy of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC\n\n“They’re like, ‘Oh my god, this is it. This is the big breakthrough,’” said Marc Andreessen, the co-creator of the first commercial Web browser, Netscape, and a big investor in technology ventures. “This is the distributed trust network that the Internet always needed and never had.”\n\nToday thoughtful people everywhere are trying to understand the implications of a protocol that enables mere mortals to manufacture trust through clever code. This has never happened before—trusted transactions directly between two or more parties, authenticated by mass collaboration and powered by collective self-interests, rather than by large corporations motivated by profit.\n\nIt may not be the Almighty, but a trustworthy global platform for our transactions is something very big. We’re calling it the Trust Protocol.\n\nThis protocol is the foundation of a growing number of global distributed ledgers called blockchains—of which the Bitcoin blockchain is the largest. While the technology is complicated, the main idea is simple. Blockchains enable us to send money directly and safely from me to you, without going through a bank, a credit card company, or PayPal.\n\nRather than the Internet of Information, it’s the Internet of Value or of Money. It’s also a platform for everyone to know what is true—at least with regard to structured recorded information. At its most basic, it is an open source code: anyone can download it for free, run it, and use it to develop new tools for managing transactions online. As such, it holds the potential for unleashing countless new applications and as yet unrealized capabilities that have the potential to transform many things.\n\nBig banks and some governments are implementing blockchains as distributed ledgers to revolutionize the way information is stored and transactions occur. Their goals are laudable—speed, lower cost, security, fewer errors, and the elimination of central points of attack and failure. These models don’t necessarily involve a cryptocurrency for payments.\n\nHowever, the most important and far-reaching blockchains are based on the bitcoin model. Here’s how they work.\n\nBitcoin or other digital currency isn’t saved in a file somewhere; it’s represented by transactions recorded in a blockchain—kind of like a global spreadsheet or ledger, which leverages the resources of a large peer-to-peer bitcoin network to verify and approve each Bitcoin transaction. Each blockchain, like the one that uses Bitcoin, is distributed: it runs on computers by volunteers around the world; there is no central database to hack. The blockchain is public: anyone can view it at any time because it resides on the network, not within a single institution charged with auditing transactions and keeping records. And the blockchain is encrypted: it uses heavy-duty encryption involving public and private keys–like the two-key system to access a safety deposit box–to maintain virtual security. You needn’t worry about the weak firewalls of Target or Home Depot, or a thieving staffer of Morgan Stanley or the U.S. federal government.\n\nEvery 10 minutes, all the transactions conducted are verified, cleared, and stored in a block that is linked to the preceding block, creating a chain. Each block must refer to the preceding block to be valid. This structure permanently time-stamps and stores exchanges of value, preventing anyone from altering the ledger. If you wanted to steal a Bitcoin, you’d have to rewrite the coin’s entire history on the blockchain in broad daylight. That’s practically impossible. So the blockchain is a distributed ledger representing a network consensus of every transaction that has ever occurred. Like the World Wide Web of information, it’s the World Wide Ledger of value—a distributed ledger that everyone can download and run on their personal computer.\n\nSome scholars have argued that the invention of double-entry bookkeeping enabled the rise of capitalism and the nation-state. This new digital ledger of economic transactions can be programmed to record virtually everything of value and importance to humankind: birth and death certificates, deeds and titles of ownership, financial accounts, votes, provenance of food, and anything else that can be expressed in code.\n\nThe new platform enables a reconciliation of digital records regarding just about everything in real time. In fact, soon billions of smart things in the physical world will be sensing, responding, communicating, sharing important data, doing everything from protecting our environment to managing our health. This Internet of Everything needs a Ledger of Everything. Business, commerce, and the economy need a Digital Reckoning.\n\nSo why should you care? We believe the truth can set us free and distributed trust will profoundly affect people in all walks of life. Maybe you’re a consumer who wants to know where that hamburger meat really came from. Perhaps you’re an immigrant who’s sick of paying big fees to send money home to loved ones. Maybe you’re an aid worker who needs to identify land titles of landowners so you can rebuild their homes after an earthquake. Or a citizen fed up with the lack of transparency and accountability of political leaders. Or a user of social media who values your privacy and thinks all the data you generate might be worth something—to you. Even as we write, innovators are building blockchain-based applications that serve these ends. And they are just the beginning.\n\nReprinted from Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World by Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott with permission of Portfolio, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC. Copyright © Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott, 2016.', 'Given the increasing prominence of the idea blockchain tech will impact enterprise business, both retail investors and investment institutions are optimistic the market could soon develop into a vibrant new asset class.\n\nHowever, to date, there have been few alternative digital assets that have offered a value proposition that differs from that of bitcoin, the oldest publicly traded blockchain-based cryptocurrency.\n\nToday, bitcoin appeals to investors with both a high tolerance for risk and those who believe the digital currency could one day become a stable store of value and financial rail competitive in global commerce. Though often cited as volatile, bitcoin’s market remains one of the more stable among digital currencies, with a market cap today in excess of $7bn at press time.\n\nMany alternative digital currencies, in turn, have offered a similar value proposition, and comparably more pronounced volatility.\n\nAmid this landscape, ether, a currency transacted through the Ethereum platform, is perhaps emerging as a contender for more adventurous portfolios. Despite a recent slump in price, ether volume has seen strong growth as more global exchanges add the asset to their offerings.\n\nEther provides unique benefits not offered by alternative digital currencies, including bitcoin, but it also comes with its own set of risks and considerations. Interested investors can benefit from learning the basics of ethereum, as well as the key variables that influence ether’s price movements.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nA platform for decentralized applications, Ethereum was invented by Vitalik Buterin and announced in early 2014. At the time, Buterin indicated in public appearances he was keen to create an alternative blockchain-based system that would offer a superior arsenal of tools to global developers.\n\nLaunching in beta in July 2015 and in a production version this March, Ethereum’s big innovation is that it runs Turing-complete smart contracts, applications that rely on if-then scenarios to execute specific terms of an agreement.\n\nBasically, smart contracts ensure that once a predetermined condition is met, the corresponding clause contained in the contract is fulfilled, and the Turing-complete factor has been heralded as allowing developers a new expressiveness in writing such code.\n\nToday, smart contracts can run on the public Ethereum blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that is used to keep track of all related transactions and agreements.\n\nThe smart contracts that run on its blockchain could have widespread applications, as developers could use them to create markets, execute transactions based on agreements created long ago and keep track of pledges made by different counterparties.\n\nMany users have already begun taking advantage of these myriad options, developing a wide range of apps that can be used to set up ridesharing applications, sports bets and even investment schemes, The New York Times has reported.\n\nBut as open-source technology, corporations are free to create their own private blockchains based on Ethereum that do not use the public Ethereum blockchain, and as such, don’t use Ethereum’s token, ether.\n\nHow ether\'s market works\n\nUnlike bitcoin, ether is not designed to function as a global digital currency. Instead, it is meant to pay for specific actions on the Ethereum network, with users receiving it for using their computing power to validate transactions and for contributing to its development\n\nHowever, ether’s market is currently supported by many of the same exchanges and infrastructure that has built up around the bitcoin network. For example, users who have historically bought bitcoin and other digital currencies on venture-backed exchange platforms such as Bitfinex and Kraken can today buy ether on these websites.\n\nBut, ether’s market did not develop in the same manner as bitcoin’s market.\n\nIn bitcoin, users were once able to process transactions on the network using a home computer, and then eventually, home mining equipment. Bitcoin grew in value as the number of participants in the network expanded. Ethereum arguably developed under different circumstances.\n\nIn a bid to galvanize a global development community around its idea, Ethereum launched a pre-sale of ether tokens in 2014, raising more than $14m in what has been called a crowdfunding effort, but bears resemblance to a kind of informal initial public offering (IPO).\n\nDonations collected for this sale were the driving factor behind the initial supply and the rate of issuance that existed after. As a result of this event, contributors of the presale received 60m ether. Another 12m went to the development fund, with the majority of this amount going to early developers and contributors. The Swizterland-based non-profit Ethereum Foundation received the remainder of this amount.\n\nThese numbers added up to an initial ether supply of 72m ETH. Following this event, Ethereum’s protocol permitted the creation of 5 ETH for every block mined. In addition, a maximum of 18m ETH were allowed to come into existence every year following this event.\n\nIn the bitcoin network, the supply rate is more consistent. Due to hard-coded rules in the software there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins (unless the rules are changed), and the rate at which new tokens are introduced is 25 BTC roughly every 10 minutes today.\n\nInvestors should note that such consistency is not guaranteed in the ether market.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation announced at the time of launch that ether’s rules would soon change, and that starting some time in 2017, the network would follow the rules of Casper, a consensus algorithm still being developed.\n\nAs of mid-April, the total number of ether transactions stood at 3.3 million, resulting in an ether supply of 79m ETH, Etherscan figures reveal.\n\nIn addition, ether was trading at 0.0197 BTC, or about $9.25.\n\nHow does mining affect price?\n\nAs stated above, one of the biggest factors on bitcoin’s price is the steady introduction of new bitcoins through payments to the computer operators that process transactions (miners).\n\nMining affects price by increasing the supply, and through the decision of miners to hold or sell bitcoin. Ethereum’s current version, Homestead, leverages a proof-of-work based consensus algorithm, rewarding computers that contribute to its security in the same way.\n\nUnder this system, miners create a new block every 15-17 seconds, resulting in the creation of 5 ETH, according to figures provided by Ethereum.org. Miners that contribute to discovering a solution, but don’t get their block included, can receive two or three new ethers, which is called an uncle/aunt reward.\n\nOnce Ethereum starts using Casper, a proof-of-stake protocol, this rate is expected to change, as many anticipate Casper will provide a smaller mining subsidy. Under the new protocol, nodes will not be able to validate transactions and therefore produce blocks unless they provide a security deposit.\n\nShould the protocol determine that a node, or ""bonded validator,"" has produced anything invalid, the node will lose both any deposit provided and also the ability to participate in the consensus process. Currently, bonded validators face no penalty if they produce blocks considered invalid by the protocol.\n\nBy changing incentives, it is expected that Casper will be more efficient, but the change could also mean that ether’s value is adjusted to the new realities of the network’s operation.\n\nSecurity questions\n\nWith seven years of development (and few major issues), the bitcoin network is often heralded by supporters as the most secure blockchain. Even enterprise businesses have expressed a value in its strong network effects and diverse mining network.\n\nEthereum has faced criticism for potential security problems for several reasons, though most center on the fact that the software is in its early stages and has only been available for a few years. The network has suffered fewer attacks than bitcoin, and as a result it has undergone less testing than its older digital currency.\n\nThe differing compositions of ether and bitcoin’s mining pools are also worth noting. While bitcoin’s mining community has sometimes drawn criticism for being dominated by a small number of players, this situation seems replicated in Ethereum.\n\nWhile Blockchain.info figures show five companies control about 81% of bitcoin’s hashrate distribution, five companies accounted for more than 85% of ether’s hashrate distribution by mid-April.\n\nFurther, though the largest bitcoin miner (F2Pool) accounted for 26% of the digital currency’s hashrate distribution in this 24-hour block, the biggest ether miner (dwarfpool) supplied 41.8% of this currency’s hashrate.\n\nGoing forward, developers continue to work on newer versions of Ethereum, but critics have predicted that ether will face greater security problems than bitcoin. There is only one way to find out.\n\nPrice volatility\n\nBecause of the infancy of the platform, Ether has experienced sharp price fluctuations. At the time of report, the digital currency had logged one-day, one-month and since-inception changes of 31%, 16.7% and 53.7%, respectively.\n\nWhile this volatility might make the currency look less valid in the eyes of some, these gyrations provide opportunities for traders.\n\nMarket participants can buy and sell ethereum using both fiat currency and bitcoin. Such transactions are available through numerous exchanges, as several organizations have started offering these trades in recent years.\n\nBecause of the digital currency’s sharp volatility, some traders speculate on its future price movements in an attempt to turn a profit. Others use ether to hedge bitcoin, as well as alternative digital currencies.\n\nCharles L.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'The technical setups posted below use simple trend detection, support and resistance, channels, pattern and candle analysis. We aim for high-probability trade setups on BTCUSD and use very few indicators. All charts use BNC’s Bitcoin Liquid Index for maximum accuracy.\n\nThe timeframe for trades is 1 to 7 days, so we’ll use 4h candlesticks. Bitcoin is best traded as a purely speculative commodity on 4h+ timeframes.\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section is based on internal (anonymized) Whaleclub trading data and is published exclusively on BNC.\n\nCurrent Active Long vs Short Volume Ratio: 5.15:1\n\nAverage Active Long vs Short Volume Ratio: 2.6:1\n\nWe have a major excess in active long volume relative to the average. Market sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish and has been so for a while now, with bulls coming in to sustain and “buy the dip” that occurred between $470 to $435.\n\nThe average weighted long entry price is $461.88, which means that on average, active longs are in the red (losing). This entry price is relatively high and indicates that many players are still holding on to the long positions they entered in the top area, around $470. This makes sense as BTCUSD has been range bound for the last week.\n\nAs we explain below, this market dynamic presents a perfect long squeeze setup which could fuel further downside.\n\nTraders who are currently long will be left either margin called or forced to close their positions at a loss, triggering a selling cascade. Long position volumes are very high, which signals that the risk of another brutal price dump is higher than average, should those positions be squeezed.\n\nMacro Key Points\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section is an overview of news headlines or events that may affect BTCUSD.\n\nCraig Wright coming out as Satoshi dominated news headlines this week. Interestingly, this had little effect on price. The controversy surrounding the “proof” he provided did however catapult bitcoin into the spotlight in the mainstream media.\n\nThe bitcoin block reward halving is estimated to occur on July 10, 2016, in about 10 weeks. The supply will halve - and assuming demand remains the same, the post-halving value per bitcoin is over $900. Extrapolating this based on the current market price, the present value of one bitcoin is around $230 - an attractive entry price.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\n4h+ Timeframe Setup\n\nSince last week’s strong breakout and subsequent pullback, bitcoin price has been ranging, unsurprisingly. Markets tend to take a “breather” after periods of strong trending. Let’s review the general market setup on the daily.\n\nAfter price broke over our green resisting trendline, it retouched it and bounced strongly. Since then, it has traded well above our resistance trendline, confirming that it is now serving as price support. This is a bullish sign: bulls who missed the breakout were more than happy to buoy the market by buying around the breakout price, and this buying is ongoing.\n\nThis week we also detect the presence of a second supporting trendline (dotted below).\n\nThe higher lows we’ve been making over the past few months have resulted in a “pop” in price above not one resistance level, but two. This once again signals that the breakout is strong and likely here to stay (not a “fakeout”).\n\nOur crossing trendlines have formed a market inflection point above which price is trading. Inflection points are generally very strong support (or resistance) areas - and in our case, give us confidence in the solidity of price support.\n\nNow let’s take a look at our horizontal support and resistance levels.\n\nWe observe that price is trapped between very strong support and very strong resistance (historically attractive sell prices). As a general rule of thumb, horizontal levels are more influential than non-horizontal trendlines, so it pays to observe these closely. Price is ranging between the $440 and $470 areas.\n\nNow let’s switch to the 4h timeframe to dig a little deeper. Our daily trend lines, support, and resistance levels are preserved.\n\nWe observe that post-breakout, price has made higher highs and the bears have failed to bring price down. We also observe a relatively high-volume price pump that retraced half of the pullback from $470.\n\nAlthough this may seem bullish to some observers, price is still ranging within the $440-$470 band we identified. Until it breaks out from this band, it will be difficult to settle on a trend direction.\n\nBelow we outline possible trade ideas.\n\nTrade Ideas\n\n\n\n\n\nOur multiple support areas would serve to buoy price upwards. Slowly but surely, price builds up the pressure needed to break past historically attractive sell areas: $470, $475, and beyond.\n\nOur bearish scenario involves a measured move that would break below our newly formed inflection point. Measured moves are the single most destructive market structures - almost nothing stands in their way.\n\nThe reason they are so strong is because they are based on underlying market dynamics. We want to keep in mind that market players are overwhelmingly long. All these longs can serve as good fuel for such a measured move as additional buying power dries up at these high price levels.\n\nIt only takes a few large and smart players to start selling to push price down against a market that is out of buying power. The resulting dumps can be aggressive.\n\nThis bearish measured move could have a lasting impact on price. Our supporting inflection point suddenly becomes resisting. The formation of a double top with lower second top at $470 and $460 respectively would result in a standard and reliable bearish formation.\n\nYou can follow trade ideas, start a demo account, or trade bitcoin on Whaleclub, a bitcoin-only trading platform.

Information provided on, and available from, this website does not constitute any investment recommendation.', 'Longtime Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik acknowledges Bitcoins’ branding problem. “The bitcoin name, in terms of marketing, is something that larger institutions are somewhat reluctant to deal with, related to the history with Mt Gox and Silk Road, most notably.” Garzik bemoans how this reputation follows the word Bitcoin. Luckily, it doesn’t follow the technology. And, that’s how he plans on getting some of the largest multinational firms in the world to adopt not only blockchain technology, but Bitcoin as well.\n\n“It’s a very simple psychological trick: you switch out ‘Bitcoin’ for ‘blockchain’ and then, suddenly, they are very interested,” Garzik told CCN. Garzik believes it is very important to make Bitcoin a part of the blockchain discussion again.\n\n“In my view and my mind,” Garzik said, “it’s absolutely critical again to get that public network software, that Bitcoin or Ethereum software, into these private networks.”\n\nGarzik calls it “Bitcoin with a training wheel.”\n\nHe goes on: “The private networks, once you get them on Bitcoin technology, it’s very easy to upgrade them to a public network from a private network. That’s my halfway stealthy strategy to get Bitcoin into large institutions. And it’s an amusing game where sometimes you have to just change the name from Bitcoin to blockchain and all of the sudden they’re happy again.” For now, large institutions have not shown much interest in the Bitcoin itself.\n\n“It’s more of an interest generalizing the blockchain to tokenize their own assets,” Garzik elucidated. “They aren’t really touching Bitcoin at all.”\n\nHe added:\n\nPart of my strategy is to introduce them to Bitcoin by enabling their private blockchain on Bitcoin software. Then they are automatically able to experiment with Bitcoin.\n\nBloq, Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik’s blockchain company, announced at Consensus 2016 this week that his firm’s first product will be an interoperable blockchain software solution for enterprise clients so they can deploy various blockchain solutions.\n\nBloq says the product is designed to allow users “the ability to create, update, customize and analyze their own public, private and permissioned blockchains.”\n\nA Bitcoin-Compatible Blockchain OS\n\nBloqEnterprise, as the blockchain operating system (BOS) will be known, is mutually compatible with private and public blockchains. In its product suite, the company will also feature the “fastest, most secure” Bitcoin node in the world, and the option to use either Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Classic model of (BIP 109).\n\nBloqDev will be a bitcoin-derived enterprise blockchain app development environment for Java, JavaScript and Python. BloqThink will also be a high-level strategic professional sevices component.\n\nBloqEnterprise features “trustless build architecture” which incorporates gitian technology, a security innovation of the Bitcoin core team. Hot-fixes will occur within hours and the system will be updated 2-3 times a year. BloqEnterprise can be used for public, private or confederated blockchains.\n\nWhile it can be used to build public, private or confederated blockchains, BloqEnterprise incorporates a trustless build architecture, which Garzik calls “the most hardened build infrastructure in fintech.”\n\nGarzik maintains that Bloq’s blockchain OS has been in development since 2009 – that is, when Bitcoin was released – highlighting the open collaboration nature of Bloq. Garzik, who spent more than a decade at open-source software giant Red Hat, partnered with Matt Roszak in November, 2015. Garzik applied what he knew about Red Hat’s model to blockchain.\n\n“We take open-source software and harden it, and lend support for any business that wants to base themselves on Bitcoin, on Ethereum or on a private blockchain,” Garzik told CCN.\n\nHe continued: “So far, in the industry, it’s been a story of it’s a volunteer effort on the open-source side and you don’t want to base your business on volunteer efforts. We take that software and add fixes, core maintenance to it, certification, training, hardening and we package it in a way that enterprise users can understand.” Bloq will offer a monthly subscription model, and users will receive access to blockchain applications.\n\nIt’s a full-stack solution that really enables blockchain applications for digital currency and also non-digital currency assets such as jets, boats, planes, cars and anything you can tokenize, put on blockchain.\n\n“Then you can trade, you can exchange, you can, for example, buy a car with Bitcoin.” There’s no need for a counter-party, and there’s no reason to visit a bank.\n\n“You have full provenance on, say, the Carfax report to make sure a car is in good condition, etc. So use-cases vary on our new blockchain operating system.” Bloq BOS is based on the open-source Bitcoin protocol.\n\n“The differentiator is support, maintenance, hardening, and fees,” Garzik details. “Who do you call at 3 AM when your blockchain breaks? Who should you call when you need a high-tech security fix? We offer a solution for that. It’s taking that raw material from open-source – including Ethereum and Bitcoin- and packaging it and supporting it in a way that nobody else in the market is supporting.” Garzik doesn’t believe firms like Red Hat are exploring blockchain in the depth of Bloq.\n\n“They don’t have this depth and technical expertise in terms of blockchain like we do,” Garzik said. “Outside of Blockstream, we have the most core developers on our team of the other companies. The differentiators are expertise, software and as well as being on the market and being well-known.”\n\nRed Hat has participated in the Hyperledger project, alongside the Linux Foundation and IBM. Garzik characterizes this as “early exploration” sans blockchain experts. He believes such companies are more likely to partner with a firm such as Bloq than build their own in-house team of blockchain experts. Bloq’s blockchain operating system, while using the Bitcoin code base, is fully compatible with any type of blockchain, including Bitcoin’s.\n\n“ You want the same software running on multiple installations,” Garzik notes. “You don’t want a private chain using separate software from a public and then have them be mutually incompatible.”\n\nA Decentralized All-Compatible System\n\nAlthough some consortiums exist, which seek to unite different enterprise uses of blockchain technology, there are many different applications for different digital assets currently being designed which are oftentimes not interoperable.\n\n“It’s a big mess,” Garzik said. “What we are looking to solve is having that common low layer infrastructure that works for bitcoin blockchain, side chains, private chains, public chains, Ethereum applications, and so on.” Bloq’s advantage is its cross-interoperability and cross-network strategy.\n\n“It’s the overall mission to make blockchain more acceptable, more stable and more widespread than ever before,” Garzik said. “And I think that’s really going to be the success point within twenty years. Bloq is gonna be building a decentralized system. I like to call Bitcoin the first decentralized autonomous organism. There will be many more decentralized systems built on top of this technology and long-term Bloq is going to play a role in launching side chains and blockchains, and launching digital identity that’s affordable and tying all that together.”\n\nBloq plans to serve the many Fortune 500 companies building blockchain strategies in search of understanding digital currency and blockchain technology.\n\n“We can answer those questions,” he said. “We can be the old men in a young industry who have seen the good ideas and the bad ideas and sort through them in a pragmatic sort of way.” So far, Garzik has seen all levels of education among the enterprise class.\n\n“From ‘What is blockchain?’ to ‘I have this use case, does it apply?’ to ‘We already know blockchain and need engineering talent.’\n\n“It’s a really cool spectrum,” he said.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Bloq.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Over the past year we have seen the fee market for bitcoin transactions evolve at a rapid pace. As transaction volume continues to increase, so does the demand for block space, which remains in limited supply of 1 megabyte (MB) approximately every 10 minutes.\n\nSince we have debated the issue of increasing the supply of block space ad nauseum, this article will focus on the history and current state of bitcoin transaction fees.\n\nThe fact is that the pressures resulting from high contention for block space have degraded user experience and thus incentivized bitcoin wallets to make adjustments in order to keep their users happy by ensuring timely confirmation of transactions.\n\nHowever, we\'re a long way from operating an optimal fee market.\n\nThe History of Transaction Fees\n\nFor the first several years of bitcoin’s existence, transaction fees were optional – they were considered a donation to miners.\n\n\n\nWallets paid the same fee on every transaction – defaulting to whatever fee the wallet developer thought was appropriate.\n\nBitcoin Core\'s default fee changed several times over the years as the bitcoin exchange rate increased, from 0.01 BTC to 0.0005 BTC to 0.0001 BTC. There were also rules around ""priority transactions"" that enabled users to send transactions with no fee if the inputs were old and high value enough, though miners have mostly phased those out at this point.\n\nWe learned over the years that hard-coded static transaction fees are terrible for several reasons:\n\nIt\'s not the absolute fee that matters to miners, but rather the fee rate per bytes of transaction data. From the miner’s perspective, they only have 1 MB of space into which they want to insert as many transactions as possible in order to collect more fees. As such, a 200 byte transaction with a fee of 0.0001 BTC is preferable to a 1,000 byte transaction with a fee of 0.0001 BTC, because they can insert five of the former and collect five times as much in fees.\n\nFrom the user’s perspective, if you always set a static fee, you’ll likely eventually create a large data size transaction (due to spending many low value inputs) with a very low fee rate that may never get confirmed.\n\nWallets with static fees can\'t adapt to quickly changing market conditions, resulting in users broadcasting transactions that are either overpaying or underpaying. The former won\'t get transactions confirmed much faster, while the latter will result in long confirmation times because miners pass them over in favor of more profitable transactions to confirm.\n\nThe release of Bitcoin 0.3.15 in November 2010 included a change to start calculating fees relative to the transaction’s data size, but not every wallet software followed suit and many users continued blindly setting the same static fee on every transaction. This was generally not a problem until we started bumping up against the max block size, because miners would confirm pretty much any valid transaction that was successfully relayed to them.\n\nAs blocks began to fill up in 2015, it became clear that the best practice is to use a dynamic fee algorithm because it can respond to changing conditions on the network.\n\nBitcoin Core started calculating dynamic fee estimates as of the 0.10 release in February 2015, and Alex Morcos has been steadily improving them since then. Core\'s fee estimate algorithm is rather complex; you can view its code here and the english explanation here.\n\nA Fee Market Emerges\n\nAntoine Le Calvez, developer of p2sh.info, provides a historical analysis of dynamic and static fees.\n\nHere are the past two years:\n\nWe can see significant jumps in dynamic fee usage during the network stress tests and attacks last fall.\n\nHowever, I suspect that this was not due to normal users switching to dynamic fee wallets, but rather the attackers themselves paying fees that they intentionally set to be higher than the static fees being used by most wallets at the time.\n\nSome of the more sophisticated users adjusted their hard-coded fees during the attacks, but these were likely a small minority of the total transactions. We can also see a jump at the beginning of March 2016 – this is likely partially a result of Blockchain\'s new wallet deploying dynamic fees about a month earlier.\n\nRusty Russell performed an excellent analysis of the emerging fee market in December 2015, which showed that more transactions are using dynamically calculated fees, and that the average value of a transaction is increasing as tiny payments are getting priced out of the blockchain.\n\nAJ Towns followed up on Rusty’s post with more in-depth analysis. He identified eight distinct fee market phases over the course of bitcoin’s history:\n\n\n\nTowns continued his investigation in a second post and came to several conclusions about the effects that the emerging fee market has had upon users.\n\n\n\nThese were:\n\nA significant number of wallets are dynamically calculating fees, at a per-byte granularity.\n\nMany wallets still don’t calculate fees dynamically, or even calculate fees at a per-byte level.\n\nMarket-driven fees will only be able to rise further with increased adoption of wallets that support dynamic fee estimates.\n\nSignificantly overpaying the market rate will not get your transaction confirmed any quicker.\n\nThere have been two fee events that have impacted wallets with static fees, and a third fee event is coming soon.\n\nWallets that dynamically calculate fees pay substantially lower fees on average than those that don’t.\n\nI\'ve been tracking Bitcoin Core\'s fee estimates with Statoshi; here you can see that they have tripled over the past six months as contention for block space continues to increase.\n\nCalvez also provides a dashboard with all of the publicly available fee estimate APIs and their historical estimate data:\n\nInterestingly, it appears that 21, BitGo, and Blocktrail’s fee estimates appear to be the most responsive to changing market conditions while BitPay, Blockchain, and BlockCypher have less volatile estimates.\n\nHowever, it would be negligent for me to broadly recommend everyone switch to using dynamically calculated transaction fees without first noting the dangers involved.\n\nAs the saying goes, every solution leads to new problems. Dynamic transaction fees are no exception.\n\nDynamic Difficulties\n\nDynamic fee estimates will never be perfect because they are an attempt to predict the (near) future.\n\nAs Danish physicist Niels Bohr once quipped: ""prediction is very difficult, especially about the future"". If a fee estimate algorithm fails to correctly predict the future state of the fee market then users get stuck in a ""fee trap"" as noted by Dr Washington Sanchez of OpenBazaar.\n\nThis can occur if you broadcast a transaction with a perfectly reasonable fee for the current market conditions, but immediately after doing so, many other higher fee transactions get broadcasted by other users, which essentially push your transaction to the back of miners’ priority queue. The problem is that you can\'t, without Replace By Fee (RBF), update your ""bid"" in order to compensate for the new market conditions.\n\nBugs in fee estimate algorithms also have potential to wreak havoc on the fee market. Take, for example, a recent user error that resulted in someone creating a transaction with a whopping 300 BTC fee. This was bad enough for the unfortunate user who likely fat-fingered the ""fee"" and ""value"" amounts into some poorly coded software, but it also had ripple effects:\n\nHum, @BlockCypher may need to review their fee estimation algorithm to exclude outliers. https://t.co/Jo4Png9ZmC pic.twitter.com/zEl05Uk3tR — Antoine Le Calvez (@khannib) April 26, 2016\n\nThis is an educated guess, but it appears that BlockCypher’s ""1 to 2 block target"" is using a fee estimate algorithm based upon a weighted moving average of fees from the past two days of blocks. As a result, when the 300 BTC fee transaction was mined, the recent fee average and thus their estimate spiked by 800%.\n\nBut this is not meant to pick on BlockCypher, as we have seen many wallets have issues with transaction fees. Not even Bitcoin Core is exempt, as I recently observed an unexpected spike in the fee estimates from Bitcoin Core 0.12.0:\n\nI noticed that Statoshi.info’s ""two block target"" fee estimate surged from 44 to 112 satoshis per byte on 27th February for no apparent reason. My other bitcoin nodes did not report the same spike.\n\nThis could perhaps be explained by differences in mempool transactions since Core’s fee estimate algorithm only uses fees from transactions that were first received as unconfirmed.\n\nIt is concerning and is a demonstration of a downside to extrapolating the future based upon your node’s view of the network, which is not guaranteed to be the same as everyone else\'s.\n\nMacro meltdown\n\nWhile there are plenty of challenges presented to bitcoin developers on a per-transaction basis, we should also be cognizant of the effects upon the fee market as a whole.\n\nI\'m concerned by a couple potential scenarios that could drive fee rates up faster than necessary:\n\nPoorly coded dynamic fee algorithms could create a feedback loop that drives the fee rate up with no ceiling as transactions continue to flood the network with no regard for the mempool backlog. This is not a huge concern if most transactions are being initiated by humans who are then seeing a fee displayed and deciding whether or not it is too high for their tastes. However, if many transactions are being created automatically without any human decision making and the algorithms creating them don’t have any sanity checks on the maximum fee paid, the market could run away until the engineers who wrote those algorithms notice and make changes to them. Frustrated users (or lazy developers) who are still relying upon hard-coded fees may keep manually updating their wallet settings until their transactions start getting confirmed, likely overpaying significantly, but eventually forcing other static fee users to do the same in order to remain competitive. Dynamic fee users will be pulled upwards as a result. I\'ve already observed the former happening, though not yet to the extent that it has affected dynamic fees significantly.\n\nI\'m seeing more transactions with high hard coded fees from 0.0005 to 0.001. Overpaying by an order of magnitude! https://t.co/BfqIEPfenk — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) March 24, 2016\n\nOne recent development that hasn’t received much attention despite the fact that it has the potential to affect the fee market is the development of secondary miner fee markets.\n\nThis can take the form of special customer incentive programs such as BTCC’s BlockPriority service or it can take the form of private prepaid block space purchases. This spells trouble for any developers who are writing fee estimate algorithms because now there are opaque fee markets that are invisible to the rest of the world.\n\nTo quote BTCC’s press release:\n\n""BlockPriority prioritizes all BTCC’s customers’ transactions, including those who pay zero transaction fees.""\n\nThis should not be a problem for Bitcoin Core’s fee estimate algorithm because it requires 95% of mempool transactions with a given fee rate to be confirmed in X blocks after being seen, but it could affect more naive algorithms. The lesson for developers is that just because you are seeing transactions at a low fee rate of X being confirmed no longer means that it’s safe for your service to broadcast transactions at that fee rate.\n\nIt may make economic sense for mining pools to sell prepaid block space contracts because it gives them a new predictable revenue stream.\n\nHowever, my warning to pools is this: you won’t be able to hide this activity if it becomes a significant portion of your mined transactions. There are plenty of wallet engineers such as myself who are monitoring for this type of behavior, and if it becomes a problem, we will go public. I suspect that any public mining pools found to be participating in this behavior will not fare so well if the individual hashers discover that the pool has been mining lower fee transactions and not sharing the profits from the private block space contracts.\n\nThis could result in hashers moving to a pool that they think will be more profitable.\n\nSegregated Witness will also likely have an effect upon the fee market. It will offer a 75% fee discount in an attempt to rebalance the costs of creating versus consuming unspent transaction outputs.\n\nThis is expected to encourage users to favor the use of transactions that minimize impact on the UTXO set in order to minimize fees and to encourage developers to design smart contracts and new features in a way that will also minimize the impact on the UTXO set.\n\nDavid Harding wrote up a helpful breakdown of the data savings provided by SegWit.\n\nUnfortunate economics: it costs 5X-10X as much (data size & thus fees) to add an input (? UTXO set) vs an output (? UTXO set) to a BTC txn. — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) March 2, 2016\n\nI think this is the right path to take, though I’m not sure that 75% is the optimal number. It seems to me that the most fair discount would be dynamic and based upon the ratio of the output’s data size to the corresponding data size of the same output when it is spent as an input.\n\nThough this would certainly be much more difficult to implement, if it’s even possible at all.\n\nMoving forward\n\nThere are still many wallets and bitcoin services that have not implemented dynamic fees. You know who you are, and your inaction is likely resulting in a poor experience for some of your users. If you haven’t implemented dynamic fees, then every transaction you broadcast fits into one of two categories:\n\nYou\'re overpaying the market rate and not getting confirmed significantly faster. You\'re underpaying and transactions are getting stuck, resulting in a poor user experience.\n\nIt\'s highly unlikely that a transaction broadcast with a hard-coded fee is hitting the sweet spot and paying the optimal rate to match current market conditions.\n\nWallet developers should add safety mechanisms such as sanity check thresholds at the micro level and circuit breakers at the macro level to prevent users from shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nWallets should set a minimum threshold that is higher than just the minimum relay fee. By observing the minimum fee transactions that make it into blocks, we can clearly see that as of today if you’re paying under five satoshis per byte, you’re going to have a bad time.\n\nWallet developers should think adversarially about their fee estimate algorithms and write them to be robust against edge cases that could occur due to mistakes in other wallet software or malicious attacks by entities trying to manipulate the fee market. They should also monitor their fee estimate data and set alerts to notify them if the estimates become more volatile than expected.\n\nBut, we should recognize that there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" fee estimate algorithm – it really depends upon the use case your bitcoin transactions fall under.\n\nBitcoin Core\'s algorithm aims to be as generic and conservative as possible so that it\'s incredibly reliable, but for some use cases it may result in overpaying. Each wallet and service will need to decide what trade off they are willing to make to balance the risk of delayed confirmations against the reward of saving money on fees.\n\nAs such, I encourage all bitcoin wallets to make their fee estimates accessible via public APIs. I suspect that the fee estimate algorithms themselves will become a point of competition and often remain closed source, but it the estimates are public then we can more easily watch for abnormal activity. Perhaps someone will even build a ""Bitcoin Average"" aggregator for fee estimates!\n\nWe should recognize that the ""fee market"" isn’t exactly a market in the traditional sense of the word.\n\nUsers can place a ""bid"" by broadcasting a transaction, but miners don’t publicize their ""asks"" – wallets have to guess based upon the transactions miners have recently confirmed and by what transactions are currently waiting to be confirmed.\n\nKonrad S Graf stated his thoughts on the ""fee market"" recently:\n\n""Fees are paid; products and services are bought. So, this term already obscures the real product. Users submit transactions with a fee as an open bid in hopes of confirmation. I describe this as a market for transaction-inclusion services. Users bid to have miners include transactions in candidate blocks. Inclusion in more candidate blocks—especially in relation to the total hashrate mining for those candidates – raises odds of quicker confirmation. Users prefer quicker confirmation to slower, other things equal, so the time element of scarcity is key. It is a market for confirmation priority, a time market.""\n\nPerhaps if mining pools published public APIs with their mining policies and ""going rates"", then it could help wallet services make more informed decisions when calculating dynamic fees rather than forcing developers to rely upon guesswork. This could also help alleviate problems caused by miners who create opaque secondary fee markets via private block space contracts.\n\nBitcoin users should not need to keep track of the current state of block contention.\n\nWallets should be handling the complexities of the fee market under the covers, giving the user several simple options when sending a transaction. One potential route would be for the user to authorize a max fee depending upon the transaction urgency and have the wallet use RBF to ramp up the fee paid after each block that passes without it being confirmed.\n\nTransaction fee values should be displayed to the user in terms of their preferred unit of account, such as dollars. It would probably also make sense to display the fee in terms of a percentage of the transaction\'s value if it exceeds a certain threshold, such as 1%. This will make it easier for users to decide if the current state of the fee market is too contentious and that they would prefer to delay making the transaction until they can safely do so at a lower fee rate.\n\nWhen we are discussing transaction fees, bitcoin users should stop saying that they paid ""X cents"" or ""Y bits"" in transaction fees because this type of statement is nonsensical without knowing the size of the transaction. We should standardize using fee rates in discussions, preferably denominated in terms of satoshis per byte. It’s simpler for humans to write and keep track of ""20 satoshis per byte"" in comparison to ""20,000 satoshis per kilobyte"".\n\nThe evolution of bitcoin\'s transaction fee market has been a rocky road up to this point.\n\nAt first fees were set manually by developers, then manually by users, and now we\'re at a more chaotic and potentially dangerous point where developers are playing a more active role in steering the economics of this emerging market.\n\nKristov Atlas eloquently noted the risks we take by centrally planning economic changes to bitcoin without fully studying them; developers should keep this in mind when writing fee estimate algorithms. We should strive to ensure that the fee market remains driven by humans with the aid of machines, not the other way around. Wallet developers must be careful when building their fee logic so that we can provide a smooth user experience without taking away users\' freedom of choice, which is necessary for maintaining a functioning fee market.\n\nImage via Dan Nott for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As outlined in yesterday’s analysis post, downside support may be found at the local rising trendline near $440. If price bounces at this level then the market may resume the journey toward resistance at $470. Continuing decline below support opens up $400 and potentially $370, we’ll need to ascertain the degree of the next declining wave to better measure the decline’s depth.\n\nThe pivots for trade are $470 to the upside and short below $440.\n\nMining Production Cost\n\nFor better insight into long-term bitcoin price, and its relation to block reward halving events, we consider the cost of production of Bitcoin mining.\n\nWhen calculating the cost of mining production, several variables come into play, namely, capital costs such as ASIC equipment expenditure and infrastructure, as well as, operational costs such as electricity, cooling, etc. Geographical location influences costs because different locations have differing rates for power, have different climates and variable internet connectivity.\n\nThe above costs are calculated alongside the mining operation’s hashrate and the protocol’s current mining difficulty in order to arrive at the miner’s effective cost to produce one bitcoin. Different methods for calculating production costs yield different average amounts, but for our purposes we’ll refer to Adam S. Hayes’s 2015 paper “A Cost of Production Model for Bitcoin“.\n\nBlock Reward Halving\n\nHayes finds the average cost of production to be around $247 per bitcoin, at the current block reward of 25 BTC. The next block reward halving event is expected to occur sometime between June and September 2016 (based on the hashrate and difficulty trends in March 2015).\n\nProjecting the cost of production after the 2016 halving event, Hayes’s method calculates it to be approximately $494 per bitcoin.\n\nAlthough there is no direct correlation between cost of production and the prevailing market price, we could reasonably assume that the market’s expectation of a decrease in supply will lead it to trade bitcoin price around this new production cost value of $494. The description “around” is used because we have witnessed, in the past, that the market will sometimes trade price below the actual cost of mining production. For example, during 2015 bitcoin price, on more than one occasion, spent several months below the $247 breakeven price for mining. This is true in other commodity markets like gold, where spot price had spent several years at levels below mining production cost.\n\nAnd, of course, the market can also rally price and trade it well above the production price. This has been the case since mid-October 2015, after which bitcoin price has been trading on average $100 higher than the mining production minimum.\n\nMarket Response\n\nConceivably, a raise in production cost to $494 should see the market trade price to a new support base around $500. It would not be surprise if the market rallies price several hundreds of dollars above this price level and then returns to $500 support during a subsequent market correction.\n\nAs for when the expected reward halving rally will begin, there are no guarantees. The block reward has not yet halved and the expectation of a rally does not make it a foregone conclusion during May or June. The 2012 reward halving event happened in late November 2012 but the market only began a rally several weeks after the fact.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price is declining after reaching toward resistance following a tumultuous week. The decline may be short-term or the price chart may be correcting several months of unsuccessful attempts at advance. We watch price’s reaction around $440 for signs of reversal or potential downward continuation to $400.\n\nBitfinex Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin-price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

What is a proper way to abbreviate Bitcoin?\n\nShould it be BTC or XBT?\n\nAlthough many may consider this to be a matter of triviality, for others, including myself, the abbreviation to which Bitcoin adheres is a topic of great interest.\n\nAt first glance, to someone unfamiliar with the age-old industry of currency and commodity trading, this notation might seem convoluted.\n\nWhy change something that is recognised by all and has widespread usage throughout the community?\n\nISO 4217 might be of help\n\nHowever, there is method behind the madness.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization is a non-governmental organisation dedicated to the creation of a global standard for notation of various aspects of modern life, including country codes, medical devices, language codes, all the way up to food safety management, risk management, and anti bribery management systems.\n\nYou will have undoubtedly seen their codes referenced time and time again on clothing labels, ingredients lists, websites, and currency exchanges, just to name a few use cases.\n\nThe ISO code we are interested in is ISO 4217 which refers to the abbreviations by which currencies and some other financial assets should be referred to.\n\nBitcoin - currency or commodity?\n\nThe system by which non-currency assets are denoted differs from that of currencies.\n\nWhile US dollars take the ISO 4217 code of USD, Great British pounds take GBP, and Canadian dollars take CAD, the precious metals of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium take the codes of XAU, XAG, XPT, and XPD respectively, the ‘X’ preceding the element’s chemical symbol denoting a non-currency asset.\n\nAs such, although many consider Bitcoin to be both a currency and a commodity, they must also realise that, due to its decentralized nature, would most likely never be recognised as anything other than a commodity, and therefore its three-letter ISO 4217 code must be preceded by an ‘X’, hence XBT.\n\nEther abbreviation\n\nFurther issue also comes in the form of the fact that ‘BT’ is the recognised ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code of the nation of Bhutan, so in actuality, ‘BTC’ would seem to refer to a non-existent Bhutanese colón.\n\nInterestingly, Ether is also affected, as ‘ETH’, by which it is known, conflicts with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Ethiopia, ‘ET’, so would seem to refer to another non-existent currency, the Ethiopian hryvnia.\n\nPerhaps, ‘XET’ should be proposed?', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

05/09/2016,"[""Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Core Foundation and former chief developer of the Bitcoin source code had his commit access revoked recently. The move, a collective one taken by Bitcoin Core developers, left Andresen without any administrator or commit privileges after publicly backing Craig Wright’s claim that he was Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator.\n\nIf it were left to Bitcoin Core dev Wladimir J. van der Laan and “many others” from the team, Gavin Andresen’s access would stay revoked.\n\nIn a personal blog post, Bitcoin Core developer van der Laan has stated that removing Gavin Andresen’s ownership of the bitcoin organization on github (where the Bitcoin Core repository exists) was the “prudent” thing to do.\n\nThe move to revoke Andresen’s access came after he backed Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright’s assertion that the latter is Satoshi.\n\nVan der Laan cited a previous post by Andresen which stated Satoshi would have been granted write access to the Bitcoin repository on GitHub, if he merely asked for it. To this, van der Laan added:\n\nSo if he is absolutely convinced that this is Satoshi, there is a risk that he’d give away the repository to a scammer.\n\nAndresen penned a blog where he was “convinced beyond a reasonable doubt” that Craig Wright was the inventor of bitcoin. The blog was published before Wright’s now-infamous, much-scrutinized post. Since then, Andresen has stated that it was a “mistake to agree to publish my post before I saw his.”\n\nThe Final Straw\n\nVan der Laan also clarified that Andresen’s revoked access was a long time coming, citing the recent Craig Wright debacle as the “final straw.”\n\n“His privileges were seen as a liability by members of the project for a while,” van der Laan revealed, pointing to Andresen’s inactivity as a maintainer for the project for nearly a year.\n\nAlthough the dust has largely settled after last week’s supposed Satoshi reveal, many from the bitcoin core team, including van der Laan himself, do not see reason for having Andresen as the maintainer of the project again.\n\nStating that there is “just no point” to the title, citing Andresen’s inactivity as maintainer for Bitcoin Core, van der Laan opined:\n\nSo when the question comes up whether we should make Gavin maintainer again, my answer, and that of many others is a resounding “no”.\n\nAltogether, van der Laan gives a reasoned explanation as to why Andresen’s access was revoked. He has since received criticism for the decisions taken by the team. To this, the core developer received support from none other than Gavin Andresen himself.\n\nLet's stop making tempests in teapots; who has commit access is not important (we have gitian). Stop bashing @orionwl — Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) May 7, 2016\n\nFeatured image from Flickr.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:"", 'To say bitcoin attracted hype when it debuted in 2009 would be an understatement. Dropped into the world by an enigmatic founder under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the online currency was billed as revolutionary to the way we exchange money, an essential organizing principle to modern life.\n\nFlash forward to 2016, and bitcoin is not yet the currency of choice for the average consumer or business owner in developed or emerging markets. While true believers still think bitcoin points the way to the future, the online currency has endured several setbacks over the past few years: bitcoin exchanges have been linked to fraud schemes; governments, banks and regulators have called foul; and the currency has been tied to major drug and money-laundering schemes. Meanwhile, the jury is still out on who really created bitcoin, with self-professed founder Craig Steven Wright the latest to capture the world\'s attention.\n\nIf, seven years in, bitcoin hasn\'t quite broken into the mainstream, does it still matter? Well, a closer look shows that the online currency has already shaken up the financial sector in profound ways -- just perhaps not in the ways originally predicted. And we may have only seen the tip of the iceberg so far.\n\nWhat is bitcoin, again?\n\nIn 2009, a mysterious ""white paper"" outlining the concept of bitcoin appeared on the Internet and the bitcoin marketplace was born. Bitcoin turned the financial world upside down by proving that cash could exist on the Internet, and move seamlessly between parties, outside the framework of banks and regulators. For many, the currency presented an exciting alternative to the current, cumbersome system of exchanging money.\n\nWhy cumbersome? Even with online payment systems like Venmo or PayPal -- billed as the 2.0 of financial transactions -- every exchange takes time. These systems essentially act as proxies, signaling Bank A to send assets to Bank B, while both banks maintain centralized ledgers to keep track of their assets. In total, this exchange can take several business days. Cue the ""transfer pending"" message on your phone.\n\nDigital currencies, on the other hand, are assets in themselves. Send a bitcoin to someone across the world, and that exchange of value is instantaneous. No bank transfers required. No capital left in limbo for days.\n\nHow does this work? Bitcoin exchanges are powered by a unique technology called the blockchain. You may not have heard of it, but the blockchain may turn out to be a bigger breakthrough than bitcoin itself.\n\nWhat is the blockchain?\n\nThe blockchain is a high-tech distributed ledger that allows payment systems to work without intermediaries like banks.\n\nThe technology is a breakthrough. By eliminating the middle step of financial transactions -- i.e. the step in which banks, which maintain their own ledgers, communicate with each other -- the blockchain significantly improves the cost and speed of transactions large and small. Plus, by bringing all exchanges under one shared, entirely transparent ledger, the blockchain eliminates the mistakes and delays that are inevitable when different ledgers talk to each other.\n\nLike the moving assembly line invented by Henry Ford in 1913, the blockchain has the potential to turn our current system, in which banks reign supreme over transactions, upside down. The Economist calls the technology ""downright brilliant.""\n\nYou don\'t have to believe in the bitcoin to see the potential in the technology that makes it possible, David Wessel said. A 30-year veteran of the Wall Street Journal, Wessel is now director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution.\n\n""Blockchain technology is a little bit like the Internet before we had the browser. It\'s hard for ordinary people like us to understand its potential because the potential is all in the future,"" Wessel said.\n\nWall Street wants in on the blockchain, too\n\nRight now, players both inside and outside the financial establishment are anxious to figure out how best to leverage the blockchain. This leaves Wall Street playing defense and offense at the same time.\n\n""If you\'re a big bank and you like this technology, you don\'t like the idea of some upstart company stealing your business,"" Wessel said.\n\nThe author of the first widely read academic paper on bitcoin in 2011, Reuben Grinberg has been closely watching digital currency evolve for years. Now an associate at Davis Polk, Grinberg advises large banks and start-up clients on blockchain technology. His firm recently decided to double down on their blockchain counsel due to high demand from clients, he said.\n\n""Our clients are putting a lot more thought and time and money into thinking about how blockchain could affect their businesses,"" he said.\n\nAdam Ludwin, CEO of the blockchain company Chain, is another player trying to help the financial services sector understand and use this technology. In April, Ludwin\'s company -- whose goal is to ""digitize the world\'s financial assets,"" from cash to securities to gift cards to loyalty points -- convened a secret summit of more than 100 financial executives in New York City to brainstorm and experiment with the blockchain. Attendees included representatives from heavy hitters like the Nasdaq, Visa, State Street, Fidelity, Citigroup, First Data and Fiserv. This week, Chain released the fruits of that meeting: an open-source blockchain protocol that these companies are now deploying to power blockchain projects of their own.\n\nThe executives at Chain\'s April meeting all had one thing in common, according to Ludwin: all of them understood blockchain\'s potential.\n\n""These are people who\'ve been in the trenches, building for months. We discussed: what partnerships do we need to form? How do we go about bringing this to market? What are the regulatory and compliance considerations to do this the right way? What are the business model choices and tradeoffs to be considered? It\'s more the \'how\' as opposed to the \'why\'?"" Ludwin said.\n\nLudwin points out that banking is overdue for the digital revolution that has rocked and reshaped most other industries. Online banking might exist today, but it\'s hardly an innovation on the original form, he said.\n\n""When you go to your online bank, it\'s more like a digital version of your bank\'s branch. That\'s akin to, say, just buying a CD on Amazon. Where we\'re going is Spotify: a totally different medium,"" Ludwin said. ""We\'re working on a big reset button on the entire financial services value chain.""\n\nLudwin isn\'t the only one working on this reset button.\n\nLast fall, nine banks interested in blockchain technology came together in a new consortium called ""R3CEV."" Less than a year later, that consortium now consists of 45 banks, including HSBC, ING, Wells Fargo, South Korea\'s Hana Financial and Japan\'s SBI Holdings. A member of the R3 consortium, the Spanish bank BBVA Compass has been vocal for years about promoting the blockchain\'s potential. In a report last year, the bank\'s economists wrote: ""The key question is not how, but when the disruption will become far-reaching. Blockchain technology could reshape the financial industry well beyond the payments system; it has the potential to change the face of modern finance.""\n\nThe industry saw a major milestone last January, when the Nasdaq successfully used the blockchain to complete and record a private securities transaction, a first in finance.\n\nNasdaq\'s chief information officer Brad Peterson spearheaded that transaction. For him, the blockchain is a huge improvement over the old system of record-keeping -- which was paper-based and prone to errors -- for stocks. The blockchain ""forces integrity,"" Peterson said, by recording all changes in sequential blocks so no party can back-date anything. By design, everyone is forced to follow the rules and companies get pristine records of their stocks, he said.\n\nThe best analogy for this sequential system? For Peterson, it\'s Baskin Robbins, where you enter, grab a numbered ticket, and wait your turn in line.\n\n""The blockchain is the grown-up version of Baskin Robbins,"" he said.\n\nWhat\'s at stake?\n\nA lot is at stake in the blockchain arms race, namely who holds power in financial services. Worried about losing ground, some bank executives could lean on regulators to stifle the blockchain experimentation taking place outside the industry, Wessel warned.\n\n""The hard job of the regulators and supervisors is to encourage innovation and efficiency and avoid locking into place the dinosaurs -- without undermining consumer protection and creating another financial crisis,"" he said.\n\nThe blockchain\'s full potential is yet unknown. At this point, banks simply cannot afford to ignore this technology, Wessel said.\n\n""Most recognize it has the potential to be something big,"" he said. ""Having seen other industries that have ignored technological innovations, they\'re looking at it.""\n\nStill, finance executives are in early stages of a long game.\n\n""They\'re in the second inning at the most,"" Wessel said.\n\nCan we trust the blockchain?\n\nA database that\'s widely shared and validated by all users, the blockchain is a new animal in finance. It\'s decentralized, meaning that users collectively agree to each change in the ledger and collectively police each transaction to make sure two parties can\'t claim the same money. That same decentralization also makes the blockchain exponentially harder -- some say near impossible -- to tamper with.\n\n""In the blockchain world, the trust is in the community,"" Wessel said.\n\nFor now, the blockchain is closely associated with bitcoin, which comes with some baggage. Public perception of bitcoin took a particular dip in 2014, when high-profile bitcoin supporter Charlie Shrem was charged for an elaborate money laundering scheme related to Silk Road, a drug market that accepted only hard-t0-trace bitcoins. The scandal seemed to validate critics who said bitcoin was the currency of choice for criminals.\n\nBut the financial industry has started to see that bitcoin and the technology underneath it -- the blockchain -- are different beasts. Think of the blockchain as the marijuana of the financial world. Yes, there\'s some lingering stigma. But there\'s also enormous opportunity for innovation and profit. As with marijuana, waves of respected entrepreneurs have rushed in to build the industry framework for the blockchain -- conscious that if they don\'t, others will reach the gold rush before they do.\n\n""There\'s a lot of money to be made if you\'re the guy who comes up with the standard,"" Wessel said.\n\nAs they brace themselves for industry-wide disruption, finance executives are being careful to make strategic partnerships with each other.\n\n""You have to worry that these consortiums get together and all of the sudden it\'s a cartel. You have to assume that our friends in the government are keeping an eye on this,"" Wessel said.\n\nAre they? At Davis Polk, Ginsberg said government regulators are, at least at the moment, ""cautiously optimistic"" toward the blockchain.\n\n""It\'s a wait-and-see approach,"" he said. ""I would not characterize the regulators as pushing back or holding back development and progress.""\n\nSizing up the ""new pie""\n\nEven if it disrupts the financial sector in the short term, the blockchain could have significant positive impact in the long run. For one, it might lower the cost of financial transactions. By reducing the odds of costly lags and errors, the blockchain could create significant savings -- which banks could then use as profit while lowering customer fees.\n\n""We envision a world where the software transformation of financial services will lead to greater financial inclusion -- that financial services products will be cheaper, more secure and reach far more people,"" Ludwin said.\n\nThe blockchain also has exciting implications beyond finance. In BBVA Compass\' 2015 report, bank economists noted that efforts are underway to use the blockchain for all kinds of purposes, including ""improving audits, registering property, creating digital identities and generating more secure voting systems.""\n\n""People are excited because we\'ve all struggled with record-keeping problems in our lives, and wondered why those systems are so outdated,"" Peterson said. He predicts the blockchain could, for example, help governments collect and maintain robust population data, with all citizens entered into a ledger at birth -- eliminating the need for a costly Census every ten years.\n\n""You could just do a query to know how old people are, where they are, when to tax them,"" he said.\n\nWhile bitcoin still grabs headlines, when it comes to the future of cryptocurrency, we might be missing the more interesting story.\n\n""All the noise about bitcoin has crowded out discussion of the new technology,"" Wessel said.\n\nIn six months, Chain plans to host its second blockchain summit, this one significantly bigger than the first, in San Francisco. Meanwhile, every day Ludwin braces himself for the industry shake-up he views is inevitable.\n\n""There will be winners and losers,"" he said. ""The financial industry will probably get smaller. But the winners will have an outsized share of the new pie.""', 'Blockchain technology is not just useful for creating digital currencies such as Bitcoin or developing new financial technologies.\n\nBlockchains can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as tracking ownership or the provenance of documents, digital assets, physical assets or voting rights.\n\nBlockchain technology was popularised by the Bitcoin digital currency system. But, essentially, a blockchain is just a special kind of database. The Bitcoin blockchain stores cryptographically signed records of financial transfers, but blockchain systems can store any kind of data. Blockchains can also store and run computer code called “smart contracts”.\n\nWhat makes a blockchain system special is that it doesn’t run on just one computer like a regular database. Rather, many distributed processing nodes collaborate to run it. There can be a full copy of the database on every node, and the system encourages all those nodes to establish a consensus about its contents.\n\nThis boosts our confidence in the database and its contents. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to meddle with the database without others finding out and correcting it. The global consensus among the nodes about the integrity and contents of the distributed database is why it’s often called a “distributed ledger”.\n\nWhy all the hype?\n\nIn our society, we normally rely on trusted third parties, such as lawyers, courts, banks and governments to process and keep authoritative records about commercial transactions.\n\nThese transactions aren’t just about financial transfers, but also include the creation or transfer of physical assets, shareholdings, certifications, digital rights, intellectual property or even votes.\n\nThese third parties are trusted because we rely on them. If they fail or lie, we suffer. We tend to trust the third parties for reasons that are external to the database; lawyers are accredited; votes are counted by independent monitors; and courts run to established laws for matters such as oversight and the possibility of appeal.\n\nBlockchains are interesting because the integrity of the contents of the distributed ledger does not rely on any specific individual or organisation. So, rather than relying on trusted third-party organisations to facilitate these commercial transactions, we might instead rely on a trusted blockchain system.\n\nThis means blockchains give us new opportunities to rethink how parts of our society work. Innovation here might reduce friction in the economy, or create new kinds of services and ways of doing business with each other.\n\nWhether or not blockchain systems are trustworthy is an interesting question. The reasons for believing that blockchain systems won’t fail or lie would be based on our understanding of the underlying software technologies. It also depends on our understanding of market incentives that influence behaviour of the many distributed processing nodes that run blockchains.\n\nHowever, blockchain technologies are still new in the scheme of things, and the community is still discovering their risks, limitations and potential economic and social impact.\n\nHow will blockchains be used?\n\nBecause blockchain technology is so new, it’s difficult to predict exactly how they will end up being used. This is why we at Data61 in CSIRO are exploring new ways blockchains can be used across industries.\n\nTo understand the economic and societal opportunities presented by blockchain technology, we also need to understand its technological risks and limitations. At Data61, we plan to identify, develop and evaluate some “proof of concept” systems using blockchains to investigate them.\n\nA recent UK government report on blockchain technologies provides a good overview and examples of the use of blockchain.\n\nOne of these is Everledger, a company founded by Australian woman Leanne Kemp.\n\nEverledger uses a blockchain to record information about the provenance and ownership of individual diamonds and other valuables. Here, rather than the blockchain recording transfers of digital currency, it records transfers of ownership of identified physical assets.\n\nThis globally accessible provenance trail could reduce fraud and theft, and enable new or improved kinds of insurance and finance services.\n\nThe same general idea could be used for any supply chain, such as in retail, agriculture or pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe drivers for improving assurance of supply chain quality vary in different industries. It could be brand reputation in retail, or safety in pharmaceuticals, or a combination in agriculture.\n\nIt is worth observing that blockchains don’t totally do away with the need for trusted third parties. A blockchain is only a digital record, but we need others to determine if those records actually match the corresponding physical assets in the real world.\n\nEverledger relies on major diamond certification companies to measure identifying information about individual diamonds. These measurements can be independently cross-checked. But in some sense, companies such as these become trusted third parties for this blockchain-based system. One can imagine the adoption of blockchain technologies creating opportunities for new kinds of trusted third-party organisations.\n\nUnderlying all of these applications is the need for data integrity, which is the key security property for commercial systems, and the primary property for blockchain technologies.\n\nFor financial transactions, data integrity means you can’t spend money you don’t have, and you can’t spend money twice. For physical supply chains, this means you can’t fraudulently acquire record of ownership for an asset.\n\nHowever, other security properties, such as privacy and confidentiality, are also important in many application areas. To achieve confidentiality, other mechanisms such as cryptography must be used in conjunction with the blockchain.\n\nPart of our software architecture research at Data61 is to seek to understand how design choices for software-based systems affect tradeoffs for qualities including security (integrity, confidentiality, privacy), performance (latency, throughput and scalability), and others.\n\nGood design choices can control risks to achieving these qualities, and this is part of what is evaluated in our research using proof-of-concept systems.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nComputer programs are a special kind of data and so can be stored in a database. That means we can store programs in the distributed ledger of a blockchain system, and execute those programs while later transactions are being processed.\n\nIn the Ethereum blockchain, these programs can be highly complex. These programs are normally called “smart contracts”.\n\nSmart contracts can carry value, and can conditionally transfer that value according to complex business conditions based on the latest state of the distributed ledger.\n\nThis means blockchain systems can do more than store information about commercial transactions; they can also process commercial transactions too. This greatly expands the opportunities for using blockchain systems.\n\nAlthough smart contracts are often thought of as standing for self-executing legal contracts, they are written in a general purpose programming language and can be used to implement a wide range of business logic.\n\nCan smart contracts actually stand as legal contracts? This is an interesting question. For legal contracts to be enforceable, they need to be understandable by reasonable persons.\n\nCan the bytecode of a program stored on a blockchain really be understood by any human? Perhaps only obsessive hobbyists might be able to develop that skill! Another thread of research in Data61 is investigating new ways of representing and analysing smart contracts, using recent results from legal informatics.\n\nBlockchain technology is still in its infancy. There are a wide range of plausible future scenarios for their future impact, ranging from efficiency improvements for commercial transactions through to a complete reinvention of the economy.\n\nAs with any disruptive technology, understanding the plausible, possible and probable impacts – the opportunities and risks – will be vital for wise policy, strategy, and design choices by Australian governments and companies.', 'Municipal bosses in the Swiss town of Zug have decided to accept the bitcoin cryptocurrency for payments up to the value to 200 francs ($206), in a new pilot project.\n\nZug, traditionally known for its low taxes (about half the Swiss average) and its kirschwasser cherry brandy, is these days trying to brand itself as the slightly sinister-sounding “Crypto Valley”—it’s home to more than 15 financial technology (fintech) firms, and now it wants to dive even deeper into the future of virtual currency.\n\nDolfi Müller, Zug’s social-democratic mayor, said the town wanted to express its openness to new technologies and offer its support to the region’s fintech sector, by letting people use bitcoin to pay for some municipal services.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThe town council decided last week to start accepting bitcoin from July 1, and at the end of the year it will look at the lessons it has learned from the exercise. It will then decide whether Zug should accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for more municipal services in the future.\n\nBitcoin allows people to make payments without having to involve centralized connection mechanisms such as banks. It is fairly good at protecting anonymity, but uses a public ledger system, called the blockchain, that is excellent at keeping track of transactions.\n\nIt’s probably highly relevant that bitcoin’s transaction costs are low. Zug’s municipal bosses are currently looking for ways to cut costs, as the implications of levying very low taxes start to bite.\n\nFor more on bitcoin, watch:\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that Zug’s experiment is a good idea.\n\nThe local branch of the conservative-nationalist SVP party wrote to Zug’s greater council, asking what the legal basis was for the town council to be deciding on which currencies it could accept, and what projections had been made for the rise or fall in bitcoin’s value—it is, after all, a pretty speculative currency.', ""The revolution will not be televised. It'll be sent to your inbox by us.\n\nEthereum hit the Gemini Trust Company’s digital currency exchange at 9:30 a.m. Monday morning, providing those interested in purchasing or selling the cryptocurrency its first state-sanctioned market — funded by the Winklevoss twins of Facebook lore — to test out the rising digital coinage. Though the May 5 announcement that New York State had approved the sale of Ethereum on Gemini did not set off a significant rise in the price, the price may rally Monday after the market actually opens for the first time on a verified platform. According to coinmarketcap.com, ether was trading at USD $9.55 an hour before the Gemini market was slated to open.\n\nThe currency is currently popular among software developers, who see the platform as offering a new opportunity to decentralize the web. The blockchain-based system has taken Bitcoin’s concept to its logical conclusion, allowing not just digital currency transactions, but the complete functioning of apps, or self-automated computer programs that carry out “smart contracts,” to occur publicly and without a central host. Since the blockchain officially launched less than a year ago on July 30, 2015, billing itself as the “World Computer,” the currency alone has reached a market capitalization of $795 million, the second most valuable digital cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin itself, which is worth $6.9 billion altogether.\n\nTo purchase ether, you need to set up a trading account with Gemini.\n\n“There is a place for ether on our platform. It does what bitcoin doesn’t do,” Cameron Winklevoss told Reuters. “So that is the sort of criteria: that it is different enough from bitcoin and the proposition is great enough that this makes sense for us to include it in our platform.”\n\nEthereum’s debut on the Gemini market will mark a major step toward opening the currency to a broader audience. The huge vote of confidence from New York State’s Governor Andrew Cuomo resolves much of the legal ambiguity any young digital currency faces. As only the second digital currency approved for trading in New York, and only the second currency on the Winklevoss’ Gemini market, it’s telling of ether’s potential that it reached such coveted status after only 10 months.\n\n.@NYDFS authorizes New York-based company to offer trading of Ether, an emerging cryptocurrency: https://t.co/a8yap1cnDy — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) May 5, 2016\n\n“With robust regulatory oversight, we are maintaining our status at the forefront of this technological revolution and ensuring that users have a safe and secure experience,” Cuomo said in a New York State release.\n\nThe remarkable rise of Ethereum is set for a major test on Monday. The opening on Gemini is somewhat akin to a young startup’s IPO, and an early rally could speed its adoption and have long term implications for its use. It certainly offers unique capabilities, but the market will decide whether the cryptocurrency is fad or phenomenon."", ""The price of bitcoin has been climbing all year, even as a “civil war” has divided its community of developers, and an Australian man has claimed to be its creator in a highly orchestrated media spectacle in recent days.\n\nBitcoin is now trading at $457, according to the Bitcoin Price Index maintained by CoinDesk. That’s a few dollars off the highest daily “closing price” in the last 12 months that the index tracks, of $465 on Dec. 15. (Since bitcoin trading never stops, closing prices differ among indices and measures.)\n\nAnd one of Silicon Valley’s best connected people, YCombinator president Sam Altman, thinks bitcoin is set to rise even more:\n\nI am currently the most bullish on bitcoin I've been, and all my bitcoin friends are the most bearish. Hmm. — Sam Altman (@sama) May 8, 2016\n\nHere’s what the one-year BTCUSD price looks like:\n\nIt has been a busy year for bitcoin. A man claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the cryptocurrency’s inventor, “unmasked” himself in a public relations spectacle last week (May 2). The price dipped slightly as the news broke, but it has regained its upward momentum since then.\n\nIn many respects, it doesn’t really matter who invented bitcoin, because the technology is designed to operate in a decentralized manner. What does matter is the code that it runs on, and that is entering a period of serious dispute that some have called a “civil war.”\n\nThe so-called “block size debate” is a fundamental disagreement between the digital currency’s top technical minds about how best to enlarge its capacity to process transactions. The fight has gotten so intense that one top programmer quit the scene altogether.\n\nThere’s also another event on the horizon that could be a price catalyst. In July, something called “halving” will occur on the bitcoin network. That’s when the reward that bitcoin miners (here’s an explainer) gets slashed in half, at a time determined in advance by the bitcoin code. Miners will earn 12.5 bitcoins per block instead of the current 25 bitcoins.\n\nDaniel Masters, who runs a bitcoin hedge fund in Jersey and was a former commodities trader at JP Morgan, argues that the halving could boost prices even more, as the mining process will then create bitcoins at a slower rate. He draws a parallel to oil prices, which have rallied this year, possibly because oil supplies are declining. (Of course, that might now change.)\n\nHow high could bitcoin go? It’s now trading at about 70% of its two-year peak of about $660, achieved in June 2014. And that’s a far cry from the $1,200 all-time high it briefly hit in November 2013."", 'Bitcoin mining equipment developer Spondoolies-Tech has ceased operations this month, CEO Guy Corem revealed.\n\nIsraeli bitcoin mining equipment developer Spondoolies-Tech, a prominent bitcoin hardware manufacturer in recent years has, in a surprising announcement, revealed that it has shut down operations this month.\n\nA social media post by Spondoolies-tech CEO Guy Corem read:\n\nAs of May 4, 2016, Spondoolies-tech has ceased operations.\n\nIt has been a great privilege to serve the Bitcoin mining community and especially our customers. We deeply appreciate the support and faith that you have placed in us and wish you success in your future endeavors.\n\nThe manufacturer’s mining equipment was widely seen as industry standard, setting the benchmark for efficient, noteworthy mining rigs. CCN has reviewed several of their mining rigs in the past.\n\nThe closure comes as a surprise, not long after a recent investment which saw bitcoin mining firm BTCS (formerly Bitcoin Shop) increase its stake in the Israeli mining equipment developer to 9.6% from 6.6% with $750,000. The former e-commerce retailer had originally invested $1.5 million in Spondoolies-Tech in May 2015. Subsequently, the Israeli firm also saw its endeavor to merge with BTCS gain approval from the country’s Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS), in February this year.\n\nNotably, Spondoolies-Tech had even announced a revenue of $28 million in May 2015, for the previous year in 2014.\n\nThe drastic departure marks a remarkable turn of events for the mining hardware company which was seen among the most promising startups in the bitcoin industry.\n\nDissolved at Court After Lack of Payroll\n\nAccording to a report from Finance Magnates , seven employees from Spondoolies requested an Israeli court to dissolve the company after being notified that the company could no longer afford to retain them, whilst denying their last salary settlement. Spondoolies suffered from a lack of creditors, despite the recent investment by BTCS which wasn’t enough.\n\nThe employees also sought the court to appoint a temporary liquidator in the hopes of finding a new investor or, alternatively, an acquisition of the firm or parts of it.\n\nThe reason cited in the report for the change of fortunes for the bitcoin mining hardware firm is competition with China-based bitcoin hardware developers, ultimately proving to be a curtain call for Spondoolies-Tech.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Since Segregated Witness was announced last December, it has been one of the most anticipated software releases across the bitcoin community. If it succeeds, the software patch could be the first step to growing the block size and scaling bitcoin.\n\nYet, due to the scope of the project and the long-term implications it could have for the $7bn network, the development team is moving carefully. Despite recent assurances that segwit would launch in April, the team continues to review the software well into May.\n\nIn an interview, Eric Lombrozo, CEO of Ciphrex and a spokesperson for Bitcoin Core, cautioned that there could be any number of unanticipated bugs that the team found, leaving the timeframe for when it launches up in the air. On top of the regular Core developers, Lombrozo said that independent developers have been tasked with trying to break the code as an extra precaution.\n\nWhile Bitcoin Core is cautious not to launch prematurely, the team is pushing hard to complete the project as it provides an immediate block size increase. Lombrozo suggested that ""with typical commonly used transaction types"", users can expect an 1.8x capacity increase to Layer 1, the base layer of the bitcoin network.\n\nHowever, segwit is much more than just a step towards scalability. Lombrozo explained that the update will also make it easier to implement future changes.\n\nLombrozo told CoinDesk:\n\n""Being able to deploy improvements to the protocol smoothly has been a difficult challenge in the past. With segwit we will also be able to do things like improve or replace the scripting language and build more sophisticated smart contracts.""\n\nWhile it is true that scaling is highly anticipated, the capacity by which new rollouts can be implemented could have even greater implications for bitcoin down the line.\n\nTesting the framework\n\nBut, segwit didn’t originate as a method by which to scale the bitcoin network. Instead, the ultimate goal was to try and solve transaction malleability, a quality of the network that has been controversial since its use as a scapegoat for Mt Gox\'s early exchange issues.\n\nWith the transaction malleabiltiy goal in mind, Wuille started working on segwit with Elements Alpha, a sidechain software developed by Blockstream for this sort of prototype development.\n\nIt wasn’t until after the Scaling Bitcoin Montreal conference held in September that the idea of using segwit as a scaling mechanism via a soft fork was discussed.\n\nLombrozo explained that bitcoin developer Luke-Jr first discovered the mechanism by which segwit could be used to scale bitcoin without needing to initiate a hard fork. Instead, a backwards-compatible soft fork would allow nodes to upgrade to the more current software without kicking older nodes entirely off the network.\n\n""Only miners need to upgrade,"" explained Lombrozo. ""Everyone else can upgrade at their leisure without risk of getting thrown off the network because the change is backwards compatible. Old wallets will continue to be able to send and receive bitcoins without any problem.""\n\nOnce Wuille presented segwit to the community, it became necessary to actually build it out and test it. In many instances, testing software can take just as long, if not longer, than the process of building it.\n\nBut when dealing with software that powers billions of dollars, it\'s necessary, Bitcoin Core argues.\n\nLombrozo explained that Core has already deployed four separate testnets for them to test segwit and are currently working on what they call Segnet4. A testnet in the generic sense is akin to a test server whereby developer can run their test cases against, trying to find any breaks in the software.\n\nThis is different from the bitcoin testnet, which is akin to a staging environment for the actual bitcoin software.\n\n""The key things we’re looking for are how edge cases are handled and how the network behaves as we approach or surpass its limits,"" Lombrozo said.\n\nFor example, it’s important to test whether the network can actually handle a block with 2MB of space. In one transaction, which had 13,982 inputs and 9 outputs for a total of 5 transactions, the size of the block was 2MB exactly. In some instances, the team of testers pushed the block up to 3.6MB to test whether the network could handle it.\n\nLombrozo explained that, while possible, it’s not likely that any block would be that large because miners would wind up losing money.\n\nTo ensure deploying segwit doesn\'t break the network the team conducts regression testing on their local machines.\n\n""These tests are part of a test suite that’s incorporated into our continuous integration process. If any build breaks something, we hope to be able to detect it right away,"" Lombrozo said.\n\nOnce all is said and done, the team will have to deploy the software to the bitcoin testnet and merge it. A timeframe for this is still uncertain, but Lombrozo confirmed that the team hopes to deploy in May.\n\nEncouraging adoption\n\nThere are advantages to taking the soft fork approach. Specifically, users that are attached to the network are not suddenly kicked off because of laziness, technical deficiency or inaction.\n\nHowever, because adoption is optional, the maximum benefit can only be achieved if everyone upgrades.\n\nLombrozo feels that the benefits of upgrading to segwit are worth enough to encourage application developers to put the work in.\n\n""Not only will they be able to use the higher capacity afforded by segwit and pay lower fees, they will also be able to support other features later on that are enabled by segwit with only minor upgrades,"" he said.\n\nAccording to a FAQ published on the Bitcoin Core website, the transaction fees are going to be significantly smaller because the effective size of the transaction is also smaller.\n\nThe site reads:\n\nEach byte of the witness part of a segregated witness (segwit) transaction will only count as 0.25 bytes towards the size of the transaction. Since transaction fees are based on the size of a transaction, this is effectively a 75% discount on fees for that part of a transaction—but only for people who use segwit.\n\nBut the other reason that developers are likely to adopt segwit is because it is a huge necessary precursor, along with the recently released CheckSequenceVerify to the Lightning Network. If estimates are true, nodes that are on high-speed internet can expect to process thousands of transactions a second, up from the seven-per-second rate that the network currently allows.\n\nFurther, this is just the first stage of segwit.\n\nOnce it’s rolled out, the team intends on combining signatures, which would compact transactions even further. Lombrozo explained that while they’re not introducing this currently, it will now be possible with segwit.\n\nAs with many technologies, the first use case evolves into many others.\n\nWhile many continue to argue about the merits of hard forks versus small forks, the first significant increase in block size in quite some time is nearly ready to launch. With further testing to come, the developers continue driving toward the goal of expanding the network for everyone.\n\nRocket motor image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

So one theory goes.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nThe technology behind digital currency is beginning to influence the global economy. We're going to take a look at bitcoin and its underlying platform blockchain on today's All Tech Considered.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nSHAPIRO: Bitcoin gets a lot of attention because drug dealers sometimes use it to buy and sell drugs, but that's not all it is. Turns out bitcoin is also the great new hope on Wall Street, a tool so powerful it might even be able to keep traders honest. NPR's Aarti Shahani reports on how one bitcoin evangelist makes the case.\n\nAARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: It's a counterintuitive idea, but to Austin Hill, it's obvious. Whether you're talking bitcoin or gold, tulips or euros, he says, currency is not good or evil. It's how you use it.\n\nAUSTIN HILL: And in fact, probably the most-used currency and the most-used instrument for illegal activities on the planet is the U.S. dollar.\n\nSHAHANI: And we certainly haven't thrown that out. Hill is sitting in my car. I just picked him up from San Francisco International. He's really late for our day together because he was stuck in New York looking for Wall Street types who can help him build his startup. It's called Blockstream.\n\nHILL: Ideally you want someone who's been on the inside and has seen where the system has broken down.\n\nSHAHANI: Turns out bankers have already bought into the idea that bitcoin and the platform it's built on called blockchain is hot. Just about every big bank on Earth has a research team working on it. Hill went on Wall Street in search of true believers. He mostly found opportunists who see a shiny, new tech toy and think...\n\nHILL: Like, I've got to do this. I can make so much money with my comp tax, with my Rolodex.\n\nSHAHANI: He's poking fun, but he's by no means being dismissive. Cryptographers are flocking into the blockchain and bitcoin movement, but they can't do it alone. It'll take all kinds of people who believe now is finally the time for e-money, a digital system for financial transactions that is faster and cheaper than anything the world has ever seen. And that system, if it's built right, can protect the world from failures we have seen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: When the real estate market was booming, millions of homeowners finally were house rich.\n\nSHAHANI: Let's take an example that hits home.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: But now lenders are cutting off access to that credit.\n\nSHAHANI: Recall back in 2008 the housing market collapsed. Wall Street bundled all kinds of mortgages - good ones and really, really bad ones into securities. Ratings agencies like Moody's gave them AAA ratings without having a clue about what was really inside. And Hill recalls investors traded them.\n\nHILL: We built this kind of house of cards where at the base, no one was sure who owned what.\n\nSHAHANI: Bitcoin, a favorite among criminals, could have prevented the bubble, Hill says, because of its accounting structure, specifically the blockchain. It's a public ledger, a record of every transaction in chronological order, not a cooked book in one company's filing cabinet. The blockchain can be programmed to be smart, to give every single mortgage a real-time risk rating based on reality - who's paying, who's defaulting - to enforce risk ratios. And its digital, shared by every computer on the network.\n\nHILL: For one version of the truth - and if you design them properly, they cannot tell a lie.\n\nSHAHANI: Unlike the credit rating agencies and auditors who somehow missed the truth.\n\nHILL: And this is just a totally different way of thinking of, how does trust work?\n\nSHAHANI: This bold idea is not a new idea. Austin Hill tried to build this kind of company back in the 1990s. He'd raised about 60 million dollars in venture funding, but it was too early.

Read more...\n\nDoing something bad with good intentions don’t make it right! Maybe no one told this to the cybercriminals behind this new Bitcoin ransomware. CryptMix, the new ransomware doing rounds on the internet extorts money out of its victims, but forwards the ransom for charity.\n\nLike any other ransomware, CryptMix encrypts the files on the victim’s computer making it unusable. According to Heimdal Security, a well-known anti-malware and cyber security software company, the new ransomware makes use of psychological manipulation to convince its victims of its ‘good’ intentions. Mostly built using the source code from other open source malware like CryptoWall 4.0 and CryptXXX, the malware once infected can’t be removed from the computer without an adequate key, which has to be obtained by paying the ransom. To make matters worse, the cybercriminals behind the ransomware adds a time limit, which doubles the ransom every 24 hours until the ransom is paid.\n\nIn the ransom note, the hackers behind CryptMix explain the requirement of a special software with a special unique private key to decrypt the files. They quote the price of this ‘special software’ to be 5 BTC and the software, apart from decrypting the encoded files will also offer protection to the system, making it invulnerable. That’s not all, this special software also comes with three years of free tech support.\n\nIn order to appeal to the altruistic side of their victims, the hackers claim that the ransom paid to unlock the computer will be spent on a children’s charity, providing the underprivileged children with presents and medical help. However, they fail to divulge any other information about the so-called charity and which part of the world they are going to spend the ill-gotten money in.\n\nThe ransomware is generally received over e-mails in the form of an attachment. Once the user downloads the attachment and tries to open it, the malware will spread throughout the computer, encrypting over 862 different file types. If the user has some important data stored on the infected computer without backing it up at any other location, he/she will be forced to pay the ransom in order to gain access to it.\n\nUntil now ransomware creators generally demanded anywhere between 1 to 2 bitcoin from individuals to provide them with the decryption key. But CryptMix takes it to a next level, and charges over $2,000 in bitcoin.\n\nNow, it is highly unlikely that these hackers are going to pay even a single penny from the ransom towards charity, but for those at the receiving end of their wrath, at least the ransom note should sound comforting.\n\nIt is better to avoid being a victim of such ransomware attacks by following safe internet usage practices and regularly backing up data to ensure the safety of both, computer and priceless information the machine may contain.""]"
05/10/2016,"['“The back office in financial services is finally sexy again,” says Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation.\n\nIt’s not often you hear “back office” and “sexy” in the same sentence, and it may never happen again. But the changes coming to how corporations move stocks and deeds, as well as manage digital rights, could amount to a revolution that could rid the world once and for all of the bibles of paperwork created by things like real estate transactions. All this is happening thanks to a technological outgrowth of the digital currency bitcoin called the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin was supposed to change money. That still may be in the offing, but as the currency ages, it seems less and less likely that we will ever all be paid in satoshis, the name for 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin. But there’s one part of the bitcoin story that has the chance to impact nearly everyone: the blockchain, the technical leap that underpins the anonymous, distributed currency.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nAs described in the first paper on bitcoin, the digital currency relies on “cryptographic proof instead of trust.” That means the currency’s network itself checks for tampering and fraud instead of relying on an institution like a bank. Bitcoin works on anonymity, but a key part of the system is a public ledger of transactions, shared across thousands of computers—the blockchain. When a bitcoin changes ownership, the transaction is recorded in the blockchain after the computers on the network “agree” to the change. That means the same bitcoin can’t be spent twice by the same owner while the system is waiting to record the transaction.\n\nBut for business, there are lots of potential applications of the blockchain that are simpler and largely without the anonymity that bitcoin supports. “While blockchain grew out of bitcoin, we believe it goes way beyond cryptocurrency. It can be generously applied to many industries,” says Jerry Cuomo, vice president of blockchain technology at IBM.\n\nAt IBM, Cuomo spent his career developing web-based transaction processing. When bitcoin arrived in 2009, “I was not a miner”—the network participants who contributed to the system with processing power and are paid in new coins—“but I started to recognize blockchain might be something that could be applied broadly,"" Cuomo says. ""Maybe this thing could go off and solve a broad range of problems for companies and governments.” Employees at IBM started doing experiments in their free time and eventually got the company to see the enormous potential of the blockchain.\n\nIt could be possible, for instance, for voting to become fraud-free, verifiable and nearly instant using a blockchain. A blockchain could also move money from your bank account more quickly than the bank system, potentially lowering prices on the 3 to 4 percent fees credit cards often charge. Rather than spend three days clearing stock trades, brokerage houses could trade nearly instantly and know that stocks aren’t accidentally appearing in multiple deals.\n\nAs our health record go digital, Cuomo says the blockchain could keep them mobile while making sure they’re secure. “You can put business logic on the ledger, so it could describe how the asset can move around. You can say, ‘I’m going to grant access to my ledger for 24 hours to this hospital,’” Cuomo says.\n\nSome companies are jumping in now, with their own blockchain programs. But to create a flexible blockchain system that can power everything from banks to rental cars and digital movie rentals, businesses are going to need an open source programming project even bigger than bitcoin. That’s where the Hyperledger Project comes in.\n\nThe Hyperledger is part of Linux Foundation, which started as an outgrowth of the open source operating system that drives Google’s Android phones and most of the world’s smart TV sets and stereo systems. The foundation creates projects that are open source, meaning they can be shared or edited by anyone. The beauty of the open source system is that multiple companies can share the work of what is usually the least profitable part of technological development: the unsexy libraries and cryptography standards that underlie systems. In the metaphor of building a house, “we’re in the plumbing business,” Zemlin jokes. And there’s another benefit to sharing the development. “A shared code base is way of creating a standard at the same time,” Zemlin says, so companies will be creating the rules for coexisting on a blockchain while they’re creating it.\n\nAs with any technology with the power to change things, a host of companies are eager to claim their share as early as possible; giants like IBM, Accenture, Fujitsu, Intel and Hitachi have all signed on to the Hyperledger project. “Is the blockchain technology going to be fundamental? I think the answer is overwhelmingly likely to be yes,” Larry Summers, the former secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration, told a blockchain-centered conference last week.\n\nBut there are also challenges ahead. The blockchain as it works right now maxes out at seven transactions a second. Credit card companies can handle thousands of times that number. For the blockchain to really succeed it needs to get bigger and faster. And business blockchains will have to avoid the types of schisms that have plagued the bitcoin developer community, like the one over the size of the blockchain, which some argue has held back the speed of transactions.\n\nCuomo says there’s widespread consensus on how to avoid those problems, though, and the Linux Foundation has shown it can manage competing visions and egos, a bit like when Phil Jackson ran the Bulls.\n\nThe future of bitcoin is unclear. Right now, it’s holding its value, despite the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange, the association with the black market Silk Road and its ongoing use in ransomware. At the conference, Summers was open to bitcoin as a “store of value, the same way as people use gold.” Then again, he also said he hadn’t bought any. Whatever happens with bitcoin as money, part of its technology may indeed change finance as we know it, but with the help of the banks and countries it was trying to free us from.', ""People are often concerned about the safety and security of open source software. After scares like Heartbleed, many have questioned whether the inherent openness of open source is too flaky (and, well, just too open) for some application scenarios. But the converse argument states that open source technology has more 'eyes and hands' on it than proprietary, so it could in fact be more robust.\n\nSo when it comes to cryptocurrency safety for Bitcoin wallets, would open source be a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nThe trouble is, in general, people don’t really know enough about cryptocurrency yet. The ‘knock-on’ effect of this reality is that people harbor an increasing amount of usability fears at all levels. As Steve McCaskill writes this week on TechWeekEurope, citizens and businesses in the Swiss city of Zug are only just trialling Bitcoin payments of up to 200 Swiss Francs (roughly US$200) to see how digital currencies can stimulate finance sector. This stuff is still new.\n\nOpen source vulnerabilities\n\nOne open source safety issue that can crop up is when software application functionality is split across different teams. Scanning for vulnerabilities would normally be done by the IT operations team i.e. inside one single company workshop. When disparate open programmers work in an incongruent manner (and fail to talk to each other properly and annotate their work), there is an argument to say that more vulnerabilities can creep in.\n\nAiming to address this and other issues are the software developers at Samourai, who claim to have built a privacy-centric Bitcoin wallet to hold user cryptocurrency digital assets and manage transactions. Bitcoin itself has been an open source project from the start and numerous wallets have also followed the same discipline.\n\nAs bitcoin wallet developers MultiBit HD state, “Many Bitcoin wallets are ‘open source’, which means that developers can look at how they work and verify that there is nothing suspicious going on.”"", 'Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? This week, he is a computer scientist from Australia. In 2014, he was a Japanese-American man living in Los Angeles. In 2013, a Japanese mathematician. In 2011, a Finnish sociologist . . .\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym. Eight years ago, he or she (or they) invented the digital currency Bitcoin and then disappeared. To some, he’s a hero, and to the tech press he’s their great white whale. Discovering the Bitcoin creator’s real identity has become what finding Lord Lucan was to the British tabloids in the 1970s.\n\nIn May 2008, Nakamoto published an online paper that outlined how Bitcoin would work, then released the software needed to run it the following year. A completely decentralised “cryptocurrency”, Bitcoin is the perfect product for an early-21st-century ideology that thrives online, that is technologically hyper-literate and radically libertarian. It is designed to avoid any kind of central control. New bitcoins are generated by solving difficult cryptographic calculations that are “computationally expensive” and occur at a predictable rate, unlike the money that a central bank prints.\n\nSo, trusting Bitcoin does not involve trusting people. It relies on rational mathematics and computer code that are immune from political interference. Bitcoin is an ideal currency for buying something (legal or not) without anyone finding out.\n\nThis aspect was deliberately designed: Nakamoto spent a year or so corresponding with other experts in the nascent Bitcoin community, explaining his philosophical reasons for wanting to create a kind of digital gold standard. Then Nakamoto vanished and that community, obsessed with freedom from authority, has been trying to find its founding father ever since.\n\nThere are some obvious candidates. Hal Finney, a games developer-turned-cryptography advocate, was the first person to receive bitcoins (from Nakamoto, in a test transaction). He died from complications related to motor neurone disease in 2014.\n\nNick Szabo, a cryptographer and legal scholar, had worked on an idea that was similar to Bitcoin a few years earlier called “bit gold”. Others involved in Bitcoin in its early stages, such as Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation (which, if Nakamoto is Jesus, would be the Vatican), have also been suspected.\n\nThese suspicions are based on anecdotal evidence – such as Nakamoto’s use of British English idioms such as “bloody” – but rarely meet the standards expected by cryptographers. Confidence can lead to embarrassment, as Newsweek found in 2014, when it turned the world’s media on to a retired computer scientist called Dorian Nakamoto, basing its efforts on little more than coincidences.\n\nThis brings us to Craig Wright, who is by all accounts a politically and intellectually appropriate candidate. Is he Nakamoto? Maybe. There is only one kind of proof that most experts will accept: a signature, encrypted using Nakamoto’s private key and associated with the “genesis block”, the first bitcoins “mined” (or created) when Nakamoto’s computer was the only one on the network.\n\nWright says that he is Nakamoto and wrote a blogpost in which he produced a signature (he also presented evidence to some journalists and Bitcoin experts in private). However, almost as soon as the headlines announced that Nakamoto had been found, many in the community dismissed the evidence as faked. Sceptics speculated whether Wright’s claim was part of a larger scheme involving his business and tax issues.\n\nRegardless, Wright says that he will provide more conclusive proof soon. The Bitcoin community, which has factions and disagreements aplenty, looks to Nakamoto’s early posts and emails when arguments break out. But what makes the story so compelling for journalists is that the mystery makes no sense.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is a man (or woman, or group) who created a new kind of money and it took on real value. But Nakamoto can’t spend the million or so bitcoins he or she has (worth about $450m at the time of writing), as doing so would flood the market and depreciate the currency.\n\nInstead, they have to sit, unable to be spent, as their owner avoids scrutiny – from the state, from organised crime, from everyone. Which is one reason why so many people now claim that the one thing we can say for sure is that the founder of Bitcoin wouldn’t be so foolish as to give the game away.', 'Bitcoin’s price has bounced off a significant resistance line. The basis is now formed for a medium-term upward trend.\n\nWhen can an upward trend begin?\n\nA second rebound off the top level indicates that that price is used by the majority of traders, who are expecting a similar fall to the one we’ve seen earlier.\n\nConsequently, if the advantage at that level is held by the bulls, a larger scale movement will be likely to begin. The main condition for that is a rebound off the level of $455.5. Thus, the upward movement will have a good chance to grow into a powerful impulse. In case of fortifying at the level of $455.5, the dynamic has a good chance of turning to decline; there will probably be a continued fall toward $445.\n\nThe $455.5 resistance line is the level where the medium-term trend can be decided.', 'The distributed bitcoin-powered marketplace OpenBazaar has published a long-term roadmap in a bid to become a global leader in censorship-resistant trade.\n\nSince launch, OpenBazaar has seen a wide variety of vendors sign up to sell goods including caramel waffles, chili peppers and cannabis seeds. The project grew out of an earlier effort, dubbed DarkMarket, that sought to build a marketplace that, through its distributed nature, could not be completely shut down.\n\nNow, the team behind OpenBazaar, according to the new roadmap, is expected to seek expansive growth in the months ahead.\n\nPlans include the deployment of private listings, job postings, a built-in social network, and integrations with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and the anonymizing Tor network. The team is also planning to release a mobile app.\n\nThe roadmap explains:\n\n""OpenBazaar is and always was a mammoth project with an ambitious goal to become the backbone of global commerce. Every marathon begins with the first step.""\n\nFormally launched in April of this year, the distributed marketplace quickly found supporters, with developers stating at the time that the software had been downloaded 25,000 times its first day in business.\n\nBy the time the app and its parent company, OB1, had swept the Blockchain Awards earlier this month at ConDesk\'s Consensus 2016 blockchain conference, it was downloaded more than 110,000 times.\n\nFunction, content plans ahead\n\nImmediate goals, according to the roadmap, focus on improving the customer experience of the app as well as onboarding other types of purchasable content.\n\nThe next three months will see the addition of “advanced digital goods” including music. Additionally, OpenBazaar plans to add support for registering a blockchain ID within the application.\n\nOther features planned for the coming three months include email notifications, webhooks, cloud-storage backups, enhanced order and inventory management, a more intuitive user-interface, and an improved sales control center.\n\nOn the one-year timeline, OpenBazaar’s open-source contributors have planned several “big ticket items” that stand out as potential news-makers in their own right.\n\nThe contributors plan to build the InterPlanetary File System as an “extension” of the existing network. Allowing functionality similar to BitTorrent, the IPFS integration will let visitors to a store download and seed its data for other users.\n\nPossible benefits include increased censorship resistance, and more persistent content even if the vendor closes the application.\n\n""This means that the more people who visit your store, the more your data will be replicated across the network,"" according to the post.\n\nSupport for Tor, mobile\n\nTo provide enhanced privacy for OpenBazaar shoppers, the contributors also plan to integrate with the Tor network, designed to facilitate anonymous online browsing by routing data through a web of computers worldwide.\n\nWhile details of the process are vague, the likeliest route to early integration is the creation of “onion only” nodes that operate as hidden services available exclusively to other Tor nodes, according to the developers.\n\nThough the roadmap acknowledges the solution isn’t ideal because it will result in a segregated Tor network, a time-table for a “dual stack” configuration has yet to be offered.\n\nOne of the more complicated features OpenBazaar expects to roll-out over the next year is a mobile application integrated with third-party messaging bots, including Slack, WeChat, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Kik and others designed to relay messages from “remote” nodes.\n\n""We aim to develop a client-only mobile application, which would empower users to fully manage their node remotely and securely,"" the post explains.\n\nIn the long-term, the OpenBazaar team says it wants to improve the existing reputation system, add more functionality to the marketplace shopping cart, and create a plug-in system to allow third-party development on top of the base infrastructure.\n\nThe team also pointed to plans to develop an in-house contracting system.\n\n“Contract flexibility will allow for an expansion of OpenBazaar to facilitate any type of complex transaction,” the post states.\n\nImage via OpenBazaar\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Thanks for using LastPass! — LastPass Support (@LastPassHelp) May 9, 2016\n\nA popular password vault among individuals and enterprise, LastPass uses AES-256 bit encryption alongside PBKDF2 SHA-256 and salted hashes for password protection and security. The Virginia-based cybersecurity firm was recently acquired by remote-access management giant LogMeIn in a $110 million deal.\n\nBitcoin has seen acceptance from a number of companies across various industries in recent times. The most prominent of them all was PC-gaming platform and marketplace Steam accepting the cryptocurrency from users last month. The inclusion of bitcoin as settlement came about despite doubts previously expressed by Gabe Newell, co-founder of Valve (the parent company of Steam). The move comes after months of rumors wherein the gaming platform of 125 million active users was supposedly gearing up to enable the cryptocurrency as a payment method alongside traditional methods.\n\nMore recently, the Swiss town of Zug saw its city council decide to accept bitcoin as payment for municipal services, as a part of a pilot program revealed last week. The program will last until the end of 2016 and following an analysis, the city council will then decide if digital currencies are feasible payment options for municipal services in the future.\n\nA representative for LastPass could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Alex Sunnarborg is the Founder and CFO of Lawnmower.io - the popular iOS & Android, bitcoin investment app.\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) enables investors to gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin through a traditional investment vehicle, without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping bitcoins.\n\nGBTC is the publicly quoted symbol for shares of the BIT, “an open-ended trust that is invested exclusively in bitcoin,” and sponsored by Grayscale Investments. The Trust was formed late in 2013, and qualified for public trading on the OTCQX market early in 2015.\n\nGBTC and the BIT can be purchased in certain retirement accounts for potential tax advantages, which can’t be achieved through direct bitcoin purchases.\n\nNow for a quick look at some of the differences in the BIT and GBTC ,and their historical prices as compared to the underlying asset — bitcoin. Each GBTC share represents ownership of approximately 0.1 bitcoin:\n\nOnly qualified accredited investors may invest directly into the BIT, and purchase shares at the daily NAV. These shares “are restricted and subject to significant limitations on resale and transferability”.\n\nAs we can see, the BIT NAV has historically followed the underlying price of bitcoin pretty closely.\n\nSource: BIT 2015 Annual Report - Page 81\n\nConversely, investors may choose to purchase eligible BIT shares on OTCQX under the ticker GBTC, at the applicable market price. These securities have been deemed freely tradeable under SEC Rule 144, and are not subject to restrictions on resale or transferability once purchased.\n\nGBTC has been gradually increasing in price over the last couple of months, and much quicker than the underlying bitcoin. Last week, the daily GBTC over bitcoin premium averaged over 60%.\n\nSources: GBTC data — Yahoo!

The paper highlights “real business cases” for the technology, arguing that financial services need to be reformed and not simply improved.\n\nThere has been some misunderstanding at the root of the debate around digital currencies and finance: the idea that digital currencies are based on a new “technology” that can be applied to financial markets as they are.\n\nMassimo Morini, who penned the paper, “From ‘Blockchain hype’ to a real business case for Financial Markets” recently spoke to Bitcoin Magazine and said that things are different.\n\n“Digital currencies have displayed a radically new business model for transactions, where the use of cryptography and a single distributed ledger makes many passages in the process less reliant on trust in the counterparty,” he said. “The same is true for the logic of smart or automated contracts that many people in finance are investigating.”\n\nIt is only by making the business process less reliant on trust that banks can fruitfully exploit the lessons surrounding digital currencies. In the debate around digital currencies and finance, the concept of trust is typically used in a black-and-white sense: a totally trustless model vs. a model based on absolute trust. However, Morini adds that this is another mistake to avoid.\n\n“This is not real. Different business models involve different levels of trust other than zero or full trust,” he said. “The financial industry does not need to remove trust as much as Bitcoin, since the financial players are identifiable off-chain and are usually already committed in the market, within a precise legal framework.”\n\nThey could, Morini added, benefit from removing trust from many passages of their business model, which is still based on the “consensus-by-reconciliation” approach.\n\nIn the “consensus-by-reconciliation” business model, many aspects of a deal, especially in the derivatives market, are left to the individual interpretation of a paper contract with every player giving a private representation in its private ledger with no shared source of authority. As a consequence, uncertainty dominates and litigations are possible, which can lead to legal troubles and unexpected losses. This increases risk and capital requirements with a bottleneck effect as it requires frequent reconciliation steps.\n\nMorini says, though, that there is a way that blockchains can solve these problems within the financial industry.\n\n“An initial validation through a consensus algorithm, a single authoritative representation on a distributed ledger and the enforcement of atomic consensus through smart contracts would do away with many of the problems, making the market more transparent, safe and efficient,” he said.\n\nBut introducing a single distributed ledger or a smart contract into the financial industry is not an easy transformation not simply because of the technical issues like scalability and privacy; the evolution of the market has to be taken into account, too. For example, Morini explains that changing contracts, accounting standards and regulations need to follow the market evolution. He is optimistic, though, that changes will eventually take place.\n\n“We talk of changes allowing more transparency and safety, so I expect they will come, but it may take a while for the market players to understand and implement them,” he said. “This regards regulators, bodies that define market standards and the banks themselves.”\n\nIntroducing bilateral smart contract consensus on a distributed ledger within the financial industry would have a significant impact; however, non-collateralized derivatives would not benefit so much from consensus on a bilateral portfolio, as the risk of double spending and default would still be high, says Morini.\n\n“Under an up-to-standard collateral agreement the resources to run a deal can become part of the deal itself,” he said. “More certainty and determinism via a shared ledger, with smart contracts managing a deal-common valuation can cut risks and costs to a fraction compared to the current standard.”\n\nIn order for banks to reform themselves to implement the blockchain technology, Morini says that they need to change their ways.\n\n“Banks need to be ready to move from traditional privacy on their valuation and reporting approaches to a new system where at least the parties of a deal accept to share some of the accounting and to automate, at least in part, the enforcement of consensus.”\n\nSince its introduction, blockchain technology has been growing at an exponential rate and is predicted to continue improving on its technology in the future. Recently, Morini co-organized the QuanTech Conference where he saw two demonstrations of blockchain services targeted toward financial contracts. One demo was based on R3’s Corda distributed ledger platform incorporating smart contract templates. The second was based on the Decentralized Clearing Network by Robert Sams’ Clearmatics, including valuation provided by open source financial software company OpenGamma.\n\n“Both were just demos,” said Morini. “But they were inconceivable a few months ago.”\n\nDespite the fact that fully replicated distributed databases can be found dating back to the early ‘90s, banks have yet to introduce a distributed ledger. In fact that transforming a fully replicated and distributed database into an automatized marketplace and as an authoritative ledger was not a trivial conceptual step. Bitcoin was created in a free anonymous market, and the “success of this was the necessary stimulus to understand the effectiveness of a single ledger, an automated business logic, and a clever use of cryptography,” said Morini.\n\n“Consider that digital currencies created the right environment for the development of many services that did not exist before digital currencies, that can now be very useful in finance. A good example is what Oraclize did in Ethereum,” said Morini.', 'Bitcoin advocate, investor and CEO of Memorydealers.com, Roger Ver, stated that he believes scaling bitcoin quickly is worth the potential downsides, even if it means the world’s most popular cryptocurrency morphs into “Paypal 2.0.”\n\n“If scaling bitcoin quickly means there is a risk of [Bitcoin] becoming Paypal 2.0, I think that risk is worth taking because we will always be able to make a Bitcoin 3.0 that [. . .] has the properties that we want. But I think we only have one really good shot at having bitcoin become the default platform for people to transact on across the world. We need to make sure we scale fast enough to allow these new people come onto Bitcoin, even if it means risking some decentralization or risking it becoming, like I said, Paypal 2.0”\n\nRoger Ver is not saying that he thinks bitcoin will become Paypal 2.0, or that he would like to see that outcome. Ver is simply stating that there is a risk of that happening if the digital currency scales too quickly. He is saying that is a risk worth taking because while digital currencies like Bitcoin are easy to recreate, the opportunity for them to reach mainstream adoption is far more rare.\n\n“We can still make our own version of Bitcoin and all the Crypto-anarchists can still use that, it is just means we lost out for the world as a whole using that platform as its default currency. But I think we have a decent shot of getting the world as a whole using bitcoin and it having the properties we want, if we scale quickly enough [. . .] even if it means taking some risks along the way.”\n\nThe comments came on the Crypto Show, hosted by Danny Somthin and Chris Neandrathal, it is the only terrestrial radio show in the nation that covers cryptocurrency. It airs on 90.1 in Austin, TX on Wednesday and Sunday nights and is rebroadcast around the world in a form of a podcast on the Let’s Talk Bitcoin network.\n\nVer, Cody Willson and the shows hosts were discussing bitcoin, the Consensus Conference and the increase of the blocksize. Ver has long been a proponent of Bitcoin but seems frustrated with the lack of concrete action by the developers, saying that he doesn’t think “the [Core developers] even seem interested in scaling quickly enough to become that platform for the world.”\n\nFor the uneducated: Bitcoin’s blockchain groups transactions into “blocks.” These blocks are limited to 1MB in size and are ideally confirmed every 10 minutes (though actual blocktime varies). As bitcoin has become more popular, the network has had to deal with more transactions and blocks have been filling up. This has resulted in increased fees and longer than normal confirmation times.\n\nWladimir van der Laan, the lead developer of Bitcoin Core, stated that he wanted to wait for consensus within the community to be formed. That resulted in a major split between him and the his predecessor, Gavin Andressen. Laan and the Core developers have since put out a development road map that does include a blocksize increase in the next update, but Ver would like to see quicker action on that front.\n\n“They have a bunch of really cool ideas for these layer two technologies, but the problem is that none of them are ready yet and none of them are going to be ready for a while. People want to use bitcoin today, and really cool services are getting priced out of bitcoin today because of the transaction fees that are about a nickle at the moment.”\n\nThe fear behind increasing the size of theblocks too much is that it would significantly increase the size of the blockchain which is a already over 65GBs. More storage space and bandwidth would be required for participants wanting to run a full node. That would potentially decrease network participation, increasing centralization. That potential increased centralization is what inspired Ver to make the Paypal comparison.\n\nBut Ver, who would like to see bitcoin rival traditional currencies as a payment method, thinks the time is right to scale bitcoin. Otherwise, he thinks it may be regulated to niche online markets.\n\nIt is true that if Bitcoin became too centralized, developers could simply fork the code from before that happened and have their own, as Roger Ver calls it “Bitcoin 3.0” that crypto-Anarchist could use.\n\nThat does seem to ignore the network effect, which is the most common argument bitcoin proponents use when discussing why Bitcoin won’t be replaced by an altcoin anytime soon. The network affect doesn’t refer solely to the actual number of computers with the Bitcoin blockchain, downloaded and actively being updated. Instead, it is a reference to the total sum of miners, users, merchants and other services that make up the global payment network that is bitcoin. As that network grows, it reaches more participants who widen the overall appeal, which helps it reach even more participants who do the same thing, causing it to grow exponentially.\n\nIf bitcoin becomes too centralized, any new anarchist-friendly cryptocurrency will have to overcome that network effect if it wants to challenge Bitcoin (not to mention fiat currencies) as a global payment mechanism. It seems Roger Ver prefers a world where the mainstream world uses one Cryptocurrency while crypto-anarchists like himself use another, to a world where the majority continue to use fiat. That said, Ver clearly feels that the potential benefits of mass bitcoin adoption outweigh the potential downsides of centralization.\n\nRoger Ver also mentioned that some upcomming services on Bitcoin.com, which Ver owns, have to be built on the Ethereum Blockchain, because Bitcoin’s scaling issues are preventing it from being a viable option.\n\n“It is breaking my heart but I might have to start launching some things based on Ethereum for things on Bitcoin.com. Services that I wanted to launch on Bitcoin aren’t possible now because of the artificial suppression of the blocksize. So maybe I will be launching some things on Ethereum [. . .] It kind of saddens me that I have to do things on an altcoin rather than Bitcoin for projects hosted on Bitcoin.com”\n\nThat may be part of the reason why he feels so strongly about increasing the bitcoin blocksize, even if it risks turning bitcoin into something Roger Ver wouldn’t support.', 'Mainstream exchange embrace of Bitcoin could lead to less volatility and further acceptance and new opportunities.\n\nIn what can be seen as a mainstream financial world’s embrace of Bitcoin, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group) and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE) are all set to publish data on prices of Bitcoin. CME Group is likely to start publishing this data in the fourth quarter of 2016 while ICE, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is considering if it should include data from various exchanges for a daily settlement price which it has been publishing since May of 2015.\n\nRecently Dwijen Gandhi of ICE told Reuters that NYSE will soon launch a real-time pricing index which he said would provide additional transparency and insight into the Bitcoin price.\n\nCME Group plans two new Bitcoin products\n\nCME Group and ICE taking the Bitcoin dive is good news for the newly established ‘Digital Asset Class’. The participation of exchanges would allow investors and traders alike to easily acquire the information that they need to trade Bitcoin with more confidence.\n\nAccording to a press release dated May 2, 2016, the CME group has said that they will collaborate with Crypto Facilities Ltd, a digital assets trading platform, and that they will be developing two new products which they plan to launch by Q4, 2016.\n\nCME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), which will provide a final settlement price in US dollars at 4 PM London Time on each trading day and the CME Bitcoin Real Time Index (RTI), which allows for real time access to Bitcoin prices.\n\nCointelegraph talked with Sandra Ro, Executive Director at CME Group about how these developments would affect Bitcoin prices and she says:\n\n“There is no current bitcoin reference rate which is considered “standard” market convention. There are many real time indices but we believe our methodology, inclusion of only the most serious bitcoin exchange data, and focus on developing digital assets will add significant credibility to the nascent digital asset market.”\n\nIt is notable that RTI will be calculated by Crypto Facilities and will be calculated based on global demand to buy and sell Bitcoin aggregated into a consolidated order book.\n\nThe Price of Bitcoin will be in US dollar terms and will be published once every second according to data made available by CME on the website.\n\nNYSE Bitcoin index NYXBT\n\nOn the other hand, the New York Stock Exchange has already wet its feet in the Bitcoin pool by launching the NYSE Bitcoin Index (NYXBT). NYXBT is the first ever exchange-calculated and disseminated Bitcoin index according to ICE.\n\nNYXBT uses a ‘unique methodology’ according to the ICE press release which relies on “rules-based logic to analyse a dataset of matched transactions and verify the integrity of the data to ultimately produce an objective and fair value for one Bitcoin in US Dollars at 4 pm London Time.”\n\nNYXBT will at first take data from transactions from the Coinbase exchange. It is pertinent to mention here that NYSE had made a minority investment in Coinbase in 2015.\n\nThomas Farley, NYSE Group President, says:\n\n“As a global index leader and administrator of ICE LIBOR, ICE Futures U.S. Dollar Index and many other notable benchmarks, we are pleased to bring transparency to this market. By combining our technology infrastructure with our expertise in index calculation and data management, we will continue to launch complementary products based on our rigorous standards and proprietary index methodology.”\n\nExpect more mainstream participation and new products\n\nIt seems that the mainstream financial world is finally ready for Bitcoin. This could mean a new era in which Bitcoin could actually become THE digital asset class and could also lead to further delivery of new financial products for traders and investors.\n\nCointelegraph talked with Fran Strajnar, Founder and chief executive officer of BraveNewCoin (BNC), an institutional Digital Asset Data provider. Strajnar is excited about these new developments.\n\nStrajnar says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“What Bitcoin and the entire Digital Asset Class needs to hit mainstream is not just consumer and application adoption but financial infrastructure and the adoption of quality market data services, by well established trading platforms.”\n\nHe added that BNC itself provides market data and indexing solutions.\n\nAs for opportunities for traders in the form of new products, he thinks that because Bitcoin is global, functions like nothing else and requires a global spot price.\n\nStrajnar expects to see two things evolve from CME’s Bitcoin reference rollout in Q4:']"

Copyright © Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott, 2016.\n\nA RATIONAL EXUBERANCE FOR THE BLOCKCHAIN\n\nThe last few decades -- the Internet of Information -- has created many wonders but overall the benefits have been captured by powerful companies and governments. Prosperity is on the decline, there is growing social inequality, our privacy is being undermined and the dream of a more democratic peer-to-peer world has not been realized.\n\nWhat if there were an Internet of Value emerging?\n\nEnter the blockchain -- a vast, global distributed ledger or database running on millions of devices and open to anyone, where not just information but anything of value -- money, titles, deeds, music, art, scientific discoveries, intellectual property, and even votes -- can be moved, stored and managed securely and privately -- and where trust is established, not by powerful intermediaries like banks, governments and technology companies, but rather through mass collaboration and clever code.\n\nThe blockchain is the first native digital medium for value just as the Internet was the first native digital medium for information. We are convinced that this new platform will help us reshape business and transform the old order of human affairs for the better.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor sure, blockchain technology has profound implications for many institutions. Which helps explain all the excitement from many smart and influential people. Ben Lawsky quit his job as the superintendent of financial services for New York State to build an advisory company in this space. He told us, “In five to ten years, the financial system may be unrecognizable . . . and I want to be part of the change.” Blythe Masters, formerly chief financial officer and head of Global Commodities at JP Morgan’s investment bank, launched a blockchain-focused technology start-up to transform the industry. The cover of the October 2015 Bloomberg Markets featured Masters with the headline “It’s All About the Blockchain.” Like- wise, The Economist ran an October 2015 cover story, “The Trust Machine,” which argued that “the technology behind bitcoin could change how the economy works.” To The Economist, blockchain technology is “the great chain of being sure about things.”\n\nBanks everywhere are scrambling top-level teams to investigate opportunities, some of these with dozens of crackerjack technologists. Bankers love the idea of secure, frictionless, and instant transactions, but some flinch at the idea of openness, decentralization, and new forms of currency. The financial services industry has already rebranded and privatized blockchain technology, referring to it as distributed ledger technology, in an attempt to reconcile the best of bitcoin -- security, speed, and cost -- with an entirely closed system that requires a bank or financial institution’s permission to use. To them, blockchains are more reliable databases than what they already have, databases that enable key stakeholders -- buyers, sellers, custodians, and regulators -- to keep shared, indelible records, thereby reducing cost, mitigating settlement risk, and eliminating central points of failure.\n\nInvesting in blockchain start-ups is taking off, as did investing in dot-coms in the 1990s. Venture capitalists are showing enthusiasm at a level that would make a 1990s dot-com investor blush. In 2014 and 2015 alone, more than $1 billion of venture capital flooded into the emerging blockchain ecosystem, and the rate of investment is almost doubling annually. “We’re quite confident,” said Marc Andreessen in an interview with The Washington Post, “that when we’re sitting here in 20 years, we’ll be talking about [blockchain technology] the way we talk about the Internet today.”\n\nRegulators have also snapped to attention, establishing task forces to explore what kind of legislation, if any, makes sense. Authoritarian governments like Russia’s have banned or severely limited the use of bitcoin, as have democratic states that should know better, like Argentina, given its history of currency crises. More thoughtful governments in the West are investing considerably in understanding how the new technology could transform not only central banking and the nature of money, but also government operations and the nature of democracy. Carolyn Wilkins, the senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, believes it’s time for central banks everywhere to seriously study the implications of moving entire national currency systems to digital money. The Bank of England’s top economist, Andrew Haldane, has proposed a national digital currency for the United Kingdom.\n\nThese are heady times. To be sure, the growing throng of enthusiasts has its share of opportunists, speculators, and criminals. The first tale most people hear about digital currencies is the bankruptcy of the Mt. Gox exchange or the conviction of Ross William Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road darknet market seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for trafficking illegal drugs, child pornography, and weapons using the bitcoin blockchain as a payment system. Bitcoin’s price has fluctuated drastically, and the ownership of bitcoins is still concentrated. A 2013 study showed that 937 people owned half of all bitcoin, although that is changing today.\n\nHow do we get from porn and Ponzi schemes to prosperity? To begin, it’s not bitcoin, the still speculative asset, that should interest you, unless you’re a trader. This book is about something bigger than the asset. It’s about the power and potential of the underlying technological platform.\n\nThis is not to say that bitcoin or cryptocurrencies per se are unimportant, as some people have suggested as they scramble to disassociate their projects from the scandalous ventures of the past. These currencies are critical to the blockchain revolution, which is first and foremost about the peer-to-peer exchange of value, especially money.\n\nIt is possible, although we believe unlikely, that this new technology may be delayed, stalled, or underutilized. But we believe that the economy works best when it works for everyone, and this new platform is an engine of inclusion. It drastically lowers the cost of transmitting such funds as remittances. It significantly lowers the barrier to having a bank account, obtaining credit, and investing. And it supports entrepreneurship and participation in global trade. It catalyzes distributed capitalism, not just a redistributed capitalism.\n\nThe blockchain and cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, already have massive momentum, but we’re not predicting whether or not all this will succeed, and if it does, how fast it will occur. We’re arguing that it should succeed, because it holds the key to unleashing the next era of prosperity. Everyone should stop fighting it and take the right steps to get on board. Rather than predicting the future of the blockchain, we are advocating for it -- that we should harness this force not for the immediate benefit of the few but for the lasting benefit of the many.\n\nToday, both of us are excited about the potential of this next round of the Internet. We’re enthusiastic about the massive wave of innovation that it is being unleashed and its potential for prosperity and a better world. This book is our case to you to become interested, understand this next wave, and take action to ensure that the promise is fulfilled.\n\nSo hang on to your seat and read on! We’re at one of those critical junctures in human history.', 'CoinDesk’s Q1 2016 State of Blockchain report summarizes key trends, data and events from the first quarter of 2016.\n\nThis article highlights a few of the 100 new slides from the report, which is freely available to view in full here. For more of our quarterly and annual reports, visit CoinDesk Research.\n\nAs blockchain hype begins to subside and entrepreneurs and organizations get down to the business of implementation and execution, a new debate has emerged over timing.\n\nSplitting industry observers is a key question – Are we just short distance (1-2 years) away from witnessing the radical, transformative effects of blockchain technology? Or is five to 10 years a more realistic timeframe before blockchain technology fully matures and achieves wide adoption?\n\nNearly two-and-a-half years have now passed since Marc Andreessen penned a widely referenced New York Times op-ed about how bitcoin reminded him of the Internet circa 1993. His forecast suggested that it would be only a few short years before the blockchain-equivalent of Web 1.0 world-beating companies like Cisco would emerge.\n\nIn contrast, a string of voices, ranging from author and consultant Chris Skinner to financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley, have suggested that blockchain maturity and adoption is likely to take much longer than Andreessen\'s forecast.\n\nIn other words (and to stay with the Internet analogy), the skeptics would say blockchain adoption is actually closer to 1970s-80s Internet time, when foundational protocols like TCP/IP were invented, rather early-1990s Internet time.\n\nWho\'s correct in this debate remains to be seen, but the stakes are incredibly high for an industry with over $1bn in venture capital investment.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, we review some key trends from the quarter that was:\n\nVenture bounce back\n\nAs of Q1 2016, total venture capital investment in bitcoin and blockchain startups now exceeds $1.1bn.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Q1 saw a sharp reversal in the multi-quarter downward investment trend, with both total investment and average deal size rebounding in the early months of the new year (Slide 15).\n\nThese investment results for the bitcoin and blockchain industry are all the more impressive given the ongoing softening observed in overall venture investment. The strong investment interest that is being shown in blockchain tech is largely responsible for the industry bucking this trend.\n\nInvestors go blockchain\n\nThe major industry story for 2015 was the increasing focus on the underlying technology of the bitcoin currency, which is commonly referred to as blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT).\n\nThis trend carried over into the first quarter of 2016 with a further increase in the number of traditional institutions that announced some form of blockchain initiative (Slide 83).\n\nAs we have noted, however, there is much confusion over the term ""blockchain"", and this confusion has led to frustration for both those new to the technology as well as amongst more fluent observers who will often see different terms used to express the same basic idea or principle.\n\nIn the report, we have therefore chosen to devote several slides to presenting a taxonomy and conceptual framework that will hopefully help clarify some of the basic blockchain differences and similarities.\n\nTo begin, we differentiate between bitcoin startups, which are defined as any cryptocurrency startup that focuses on payments, exchange trading, remittances or any other ‘currency’ activity, and blockchain startups, which focus on ‘non-currency’ activities such as securities settlement, property title, asset provenance, etc. (hybrid startups do both) (Slide 19).\n\nThere are now four times as many blockchain/hybrid startups than there were last year, and the first quarter of 2016 was the first time blockchain and hybrid startups raised more money than bitcoin startups (Slide 21).\n\nIt is also worth noting that twice as many blockchain/hybrid startup investment rounds were completed in Q1 as were completed for bitcoin startups.\n\nIn short, the industry\'s pivot toward blockchain is well underway.\n\nThe blockchain Rorschach test\n\nBlockchain technology in some ways resembles a Rorschach test, a psychoanalytical tool developed in the 1920s where a person describes what a symmetrical series of ink blots suggests or resembles from their own perspective. When looking at the same ink-blot figure, different people will often report seeing very different things.\n\nSimilarly, when some people look at blockchain technology they see an open, permissionless system for achieving consensus and maintaining a shared public ledger. In contrast, when others look at blockchain technology they see a tool for providing a permissioned, semi- or fully-private access database.\n\nWhile considerable debate has emerged over the merits and prospects of public (or open) and private (or permissioned) blockchains (Slide 7), the ability and flexibility of blockchain technology to serve many different purposes is one of its most powerful qualities.\n\nWhat has been less frequently discussed are the differences between blockchain platforms and blockchain software.\n\nBlockchain platforms are similar to other technology platforms, like iOS, Facebook, etc, in that they enable outside developers to build applications on top of the platform, typically through open APIs, software developer toolkits (SDKs) and standardized protocols.\n\nEthereum and bitcoin are representative of public blockchain platforms, while companies such as Ripple and Blockstream are representative of private blockchain platforms (Slide 10).\n\nIn contrast, blockchain software providers more closely resemble companies like Oracle, which provide software packages that are often designed to be used internally or have more restrictive parameters to prevent outside developer access.\n\nThe blockchain company Chain has been typically held up as an example of a private blockchain software provider, although the company’s recent announcement that it had built a permissioned protocol in collaboration with 10 firms suggests it is attempting to transition into a platform.\n\nWhile the conventional wisdom among Silicon Valley venture capitalists and others is that businesses that can successfully become platforms represent the ideal investment, the purpose of distinguishing between blockchain platforms and software providers is not to cast judgment on the merits of the various blockchain business models.\n\nIndeed, it is likely that significant success can be achieved in any of the four platform/software quadrants. Instead, the distinction drawn in Slide 10 allows us to observe where blockchain initiatives are concentrating.\n\nThe two most crowded areas of the blockchain matrix appear to be the public platform and private software quadrants. For example, there are literally hundreds of public blockchains, represented by altcoins.\n\nIt should further be noted that the above depiction is not static. While private blockchain initiatives like R3 and Digital Asset Holdings may provide stand-alone software to their partners, both have achieved early critical mass and may ultimately become platforms.\n\nBlockchain in advanced economies\n\nSome early geographic areas of concentration can be observed in the distribution of blockchain venture investment and partnering.\n\nAs with bitcoin investment, the US continues to dominate blockchain investment, with the total amount invested to date in the US roughly split 50/50 between bitcoin and blockchain and hybrid startups.\n\nOther countries showing early leadership in attracting blockchain investment include the UK, Israel, Sweden, Germany and Argentina, which is the lone developing economy to have attracted any significant blockchain venture investment (Slide 17).\n\nIn Q4 2015 blockchain news was largely dominated by R3CEV, which to date has attracted over 40 major banks and financial institutions as partners.\n\nHowever, R3’s early lead in building an impressive consortium of systemically-important financial institutions does not appear to have had a negative impact on the ability of other blockchain initiatives, such as the Hyperledger Project and Digital Asset Holdings, to attract a similarly impressive group of partners and investors (Slide 88).\n\nThe rise of Ethereum\n\nAkin to 2015 being the year of blockchain, Q1 2016 was arguably Ethereum\'s breakthrough quarter in terms of broader awareness.\n\nIn contrast to bitcoin, DLT\'s much touted \'killer app\' – smart contracts – run natively on Ethereum. This feature, combined with an absence of the stagnation witnessed in bitcoin development (more on this later), has resulted in a number of high-profile wins for the Ethereum community, including integration of certain providers into Microsoft\'s Azure platform and many high-profile trials of Ethereum by UBS, R3 et al.\n\nIn response to these positive developments, the value of ether (Ethereum’s native token) rocketed upwards against bitcoin by over 1,300% in Q1 (Slide 61).\n\nBitcoin price volatility subsides\n\nOn a peak-to-trough basis, bitcoin’s price had one of its least volatile quarters in the past two years (Slide 52).\n\nHowever, as discussed previously, lower bitcoin price volatility is not necessarily a positive trait.\n\nBitcoin was the top performing currency in 2015, but so far in 2016 has lagged other currencies. The price of bitcoin has also lagged behind a basket of publicly traded FinTech companies while showing relatively moderate-to-low price correlation with FinTech stocks (0.38).\n\nPositive bitcoin price developments in Q1 include progress on scaling transaction throughput and the approaching July 2016 halving of the new block mining reward.\n\nHowever, these positives have been countered by clear enthusiasm shown for bitcoin alternatives (namely Ethereum and non-currency uses of blockchain technology), a relatively stable macroeconomic environment, and (most importantly) the lack of a mainstream bitcoin ""killer app"".\n\nOverall, bitcoin’s price struggled to achieve much momentum in either direction amid a mixture of bullish and bearish forces.\n\nPolitics of open source\n\nEthereum’s recent progress amid bitcoin’s ongoing political challenges highlights the possible importance of founders to open-source innovation and governance.\n\nSatoshi Nakomoto’s transition many years ago to ""absentee landlord"" status (Satoshi is estimated to own approximately 1m BTC) has long been viewed positively as it created space for the emergence of other talented software developers and entrepreneurs who could bring fresh ideas to bitcoin and feel a sense of ownership in the project.\n\nSatoshi’s disappearance also lent bitcoin a degree of mystique that captured the imagination and generated unprecedented (for an alternative currency, at least) media interest.\n\nHowever, it has not been lost on observers that other open-source initiatives whose founders have remained active have not suffered anything like bitcoin’s current political gridlock (Slide 63).\n\nIndeed, the recent speculation and debate surrounding Craig Wright’s role in the creation of bitcoin has been accompanied by statements from Craig and others over the current block size debate.\n\nView the full State of Blockchain 2016 Q1 Report.\n\nEnjoy CoinDesk?

What is this \'bitcoin\' business, and why is it so important?\n\nLet\'s start at the beginning: What exactly is bitcoin?\n\nAustralian Craig Steven Wright claims to have created Bitcoin.\n\nIn essence, bitcoin is a purely digital currency – there are no notes or coins – that can be used exclusively in online transactions. It is also one of the first examples of a cryptocurrency: A monetary system where encryption is used to secure transactions and, in theory, keep transactions anonymous. Though bitcoin is not the only purely digital currency, it is the one which has gained the most traction.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* What do we know about Craig Wright?\n\n* Computer programmer travels the world using bitcoin\n\n* Lead developer quits bitcoin claiming it has failed\n\n\n\nSo how did it get created?\n\nRobyn Mackenzie/123rf.com It may be called ""bitcoin"", but nothing about the currency is physical.\n\nBitcoin was made public in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, who may or may not be Craig Wright. It\'s founded on open-source software that releases 3600 bitcoin into the public domain every day, in order to prevent inflation. The system is designed to be peer-to-peer – money goes from one account to another without a middleman or a bank getting involved. In lieu of a ledger, bitcoin transactions are publicly recorded on a ""blockchain"" run by the network of nodes which operate the bitcoin software.\n\nCHECK OUT:\n\n* Blockchain bitcoin trading platform\n\n* Global bitcoin nodes showing miners online now\n\nWhat about regulation?\n\nTherein lies the issue. Controversially, bitcoin is entirely non-centralised and is comprised of entirely intangible currency, which means that by design there can be no regulatory bodies. The upshot of this for users is freedom from banks and full control over their money; the downside is wildly fluctuating exchange rates that have no traceable consistency or pattern.\n\nIntriguing. How do I use it?\n\nUnfortunately it\'s not as easy as walking into a bank and trading in your chips. Bitcoin transactions require use of an online \'bitwallet\' which store your bitcoins. They also generate a \'private key\' that must be used when making a transaction, as the public key in the blockchain checks its validity.\n\nIs that how bitcoin keeps transactions anonymous?\n\nIt\'s one of the measures. More obviously, your transactions aren\'t attributed to a person but a wallet code, and even that can be deceiving – a recently implemented piece of technology called ""darkwallet"" creates dummy wallet accounts during transactions that can\'t be traced back to your original wallet.\n\nHowever, because of the public blockchain, anonymity is strengthened only when many people make a bitcoin transaction in a particular window; the more garbled nodes their are, the harder it is to track a specific transaction.\n\nRight. So how are these 3600 coins released daily ""mined""?\n\nAhh, good question! While the exact algorithms are above my head, ""miners"" let their hardware be used to confirm transactions in a blockchain. If a transaction is verified, some bitcoins are released into your wallet for your trouble. Those seeking a get-rich quick scheme might want to look elsewhere; the amount of bitcoins released is a purely random lottery, meaning that you could earn a whole bitcoin or 0.000000000001 bitcoin depending on your luck\n\nIt sounds like a lot of hassle. Why do people use it?\n\nFor many people their support is ideological, driven by deep-seated mistrust of big banks and intermediaries used in what they see as purely personal finances. For some it\'s like playing the stock-market, although the unpredictability makes it a dangerous gamble. However, it\'s predominantly renowned for being used on the Deep Web in transactions involving anything from drugs to assassinations, laundering to child exploitation images. That said, it is also the preferred donation method for whistle-blowing websites and underground communities fighting the good fight.\n\nDoes anyone outside of the underworld accept it ?\n\nYes! Firms as big as Microsoft, Dell and Paypal all accept bitcoin payments, while select cafes in Europe advertise on the basis of accepting bitcoin as payment. It is also accepted by tech-savvy websites, such as popular BBS board and 4chan. Because bitcoin continues to retain connotations of illegality, it is still rarely used - though recognition of its legitimacy is slowly increasing.\n\nIs it used in New Zealand?\n\nFor legitimate purposes? Honestly, no. You have to buy it off traders for a marked-up price, and often bitcoin trade websites are down because it is so uncommonly used. In New Zealand, it\'s next to unusable. Though there is a bitcoin ATM in a bar in Auckland, that hasn\'t really caught on.\n\nSo where is bitcoin going next? Is it going to die out?\n\nNo one is sure – but if I was to hazard a guess I\'d suggest it\'s on the up. It\'s gaining an air of legitimacy in several countries and mainstream attention is adding to the appeal. There are also properties of the unique currency that are still being explored – one city council in America keeps their homeless fed by enabling them to ""mine"" bitcoin (a reward for using your computer as a node for the blockchain). While I don\'t think it\'s going to be a universal currency in 50 years, I\'d definitely watch this space.\n\nSign up to receive our new evening newsletter Two Minutes of Stuff – the news, but different.\n\n- Stuff', 'Bitcoin Press Release: In partnership with Softswiss, Roger Ver’s Bitcoin.com is proud to announce the official Bitcoin.com casino, a trusted platform where players can bet bitcoins on a number of fun and fair games.

Reveal a few secrets here. – Quentin Tarantino\n\nFrustrated, The Man sat there and looked at the effervescence of his computer screen from within a desert of red. Outside of his window, the kangaroo which had been plotting for months to kill him remained there as if nothing was afoot.\n\nThe Man, eating Vegemite by the spoonful since he couldn’t use his barbie without fear of the kangaroo, was in disbelief with what had transpired in recent months. It’s as if, in his younger age, he was wiser than now. Or, a thought in the back of his head, a creeping schizophrenia was setting in.\n\n“I need a surf, just to clear my thoughts,” he mumbled to himself.\n\nHe knew he wanted nothing to do with that which he created – his Frankenstein – the minute Gavin visited the CIA. Not long before that, when WikiLeaks turned to Bitcoin after Visa and Mastercard shut off their account, he knew the “stampede” was coming. He knew that if he stuck around the questions would be unending and he might lose his freedom over it.\n\nSo why now, in such dramatic fashion, had he stepped out into the world? Revealed himself? He couldn’t answer that for himself. So many hours staring at this screen, he couldn’t tell what thoughts were his anymore and what thoughts were those of some other Redditor. When he let himself be known – that is, his true identity – amid a hot Australian summer, he thought he could follow his plan to its conclusion. But, months ago, with winter setting in, his usual seasonal disorders led to a dizziness of thoughts upon which he couldn’t dependably act.\n\nHe had embarrassed himself and he had embarrassed the very people to whom he was so indebted – Gavin and Jon – for it was truly they who brought bitcoin, bit cash, to the world, not he. He had merely done the obvious – no, Dave had done the obvious. This is what he thought, after all.\n\nThe worst of the winter was over. Like a bear ready to come out of hibernation, The Man felt as though he’d like to try his luck once more. He took out a pencil and wrote down a note on a notepad:\n\n“I am Craig Steven Wright,” read the first line.\n\nThen the second line: “Craig Steven Wright is Satoshi.”\n\nAnd finally: “I am Satoshi.”\n\nThen, he erased it.\n\nSince he made the announcement, so many expressed interest in being his friend. Before the announcement, he didn’t speak to many people and he liked it that way. People thought he was mysterious and complicated, so he kept this persona as it repelled people away. No misanthrope, The Man just didn’t have time for the folly of people, especially Australians.\n\n“Who’d have fucking thought the inventor of Bitcoin was a bloody Australian,” he mumbled. A pet Koala, which he named Gavin, walked around the house. The phone rang. Yet again, the taxman.\n\nHe stood. He walked to the safe in his garage. He opened it. The password: 010309. The safe – which weighed 2100 pounds and was bolted into the concrete ground, contained but one piece of paper with a 50 letter phrase spelled out upon it. The ink was fading, but you could still make out the letters. The Man walked back to his office, past Gavin, where the computer screen glowed.\n\nFeeling generous, he logged onto Bitcoinocracy.com and wrote a message: “I am Craig Wright.”\n\nHe pecked in the long passphrase. He pressed enter.\n\nThe Man poured himself a Penfolds Grange.\n\nFeatured image from BBC News.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Image: H Tarar/Flickr\n\nResearchers are fighting back against ransomware, and have released plenty of ""decryptor"" tools for unlocking victims\' files. A program launched last year to combat TeslaCrypt; researchers published instructions for getting rid of the pernicious Jigsaw ransomware, and, most recently, cybersecurity company Kaspersky announced its own tool for victims of the CryptXXX ransomware.\n\nBut the authors of CryptXXX counter-attacked, and released a new version of their ransomware that makes Kaspersky\'s efforts totally mute.\n\n""The latest version of CryptXXX, which appeared in the wild today, renders that tool ineffective, returning the focus on CryptXXX to detection and prevention,"" researchers from cybersecurity company Proofpoint wrote in a blog post, published earlier this week.\n\nCryptXXX works in much the same way as other pieces of ransomware. After a potential victim visits a malicious webpage, their browser is redirected to an exploit kit, such as Angler. From here, the kit delivers CryptXXX to the target machine, and locks down personal documents and other files stored on it.\n\n""There are two ways you can choose: wait for a miracle and get your price doubled, or start obtaining BITCOIN NOW!"" the message that appears on CryptXXX victims machines reads, according to a screenshot published by Proofpoint.\n\nIn its latest iteration, CryptXXX locks the screen and makes the infected computer unusable. This move, Proofpoint hypothesised, was a ""quick and dirty"" way to make it impossible for victims to use the Kaspersky decrypt tool.\n\nInstead, the CryptXXX authors have found another way to bypass that, Proofpoint writes, although it\'s not totally clear what that method is. (Proofpoint published a screenshot of an error message from the Kaspersky tool).\n\nAnother tweak from CryptXXX is that ransom messages are now unique to each victim, and are based on a personal ID generated for each machine.\n\n""The files that alert the victim that they are infected were previously ""de_crypt_readme"" with bmp, txt, and html extensions. These files are no longer used; instead the filenames are the unique ""Personal ID"" from the infected machines,"" Proofpoint continued.\n\nSome ransomware authors have made amateur mistakes, which in turn allowed for the creation of decryptor tools. With CryptXXX however, researchers might have more of a battle on their hands.', ""Judging from various reports in the media over the past year, Bitcoin is in a serious crisis that threatens its very existence. Longtime Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn even left the ecosystem entirely and claimed the project is now a failed experiment. Of course, Bitcoin has been proclaimed dead roughly 100 other times.\n\nScalability is the main concern in Bitcoin right now, but some, including Blockchain Capital Managing Director Brock Pierce, have argued that this is more a sign of success than anything else. The fact that the system needs to scale in order to welcome new users is a sign that people find this technology useful for a variety of use cases.\n\nWhile it’s important to not become complacent (as longtime cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn recently warned). Blockstream’s Johnny Dilley said recently that much of the distress and panic coming from certain segments of the community is unwarranted. During an interview on The Crypto Show, Dilley said that progress on scalability is being made by the Bitcoin Core developers, and development gridlock is not as big an issue as some would think.\n\nWhat Is the Worst That Could Happen?\n\nOne of the main reasons there is a belief that Bitcoin is reaching a crisis point has to do with blocks filling up to near capacity (at times). As blocks fill with transactions, a bidding war ensues for the right to get one’s transaction into a block (and confirmed) in a timely manner. In response to this potential issue, Dilley told The Crypto Show:\n\n“The absolute worst thing that could happen to Bitcoin right now is the classic analog: Nobody goes to that restaurant anymore; it’s always full.”\n\nThis point reiterates Pierce’s recent statement on how Bitcoin’s scalability issue is a sign of its success. In his remark, Dilley was echoing comments made by BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen in June 2015.\n\nTo get a second opinion on Bitcoin’s possible crisis point, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Digital Currency Council Director of Curriculum & Content Dan McArdle, who believes on-chain transactions should be kept as cheap as possible for as long as possible (via an increase to Bitcoin’s block size limit and other means).\n\nIn regard to Dilley’s (or more rightly Cohen’s) restaurant analogy, McArdle responded, “Well, that one restaurant may be crowded, but by not expanding quickly when there's ample demand, it's inviting competitors to eat its lunch.”\n\nMcArdle added that Bitcoin has had no competition in the blockchain-based electronic cash market up to this point, but he fears the door to more competition is opened as Bitcoin is “hot-wired for settlement,” as Bitcoin Classic developers Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik have referred to it, via Bitcoin Core’s development roadmap for capacity increases.\n\nScaling Progress Continues to Be Made\n\nWhile figuring out how to allow more people to use Bitcoin is indeed an issue, Dilley said that work is being done to help solve this problem.\n\n“To be clear, the slow, mediated, not-compromised and technically sound progress continues to be made,” he said. “The things that are in Bitcoin’s best interest continue to get done.”\n\nThe recently released Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 is perhaps the strongest evidence to back up Dilley’s claim. This release includes a soft fork for CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, which allows for relative locktimes and is hugely important for the development of the Lightning Network, which Blockstream CTO and Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell views as Bitcoin’s best chance at handling increasing demand for Bitcoin transactions. Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik disagrees and views sidechains as a better option.\n\nBitcoin Core 0.12.1 was also the first time the group of contributors behind the project used BIP 9 (Version Bits) to deploy a soft fork. This method of deployment allows multiple soft forks to be rolled out simultaneously, which means improvements can be implemented more quickly.\n\nIs Bitcoin Threatened by Political Gridlock?\n\nSome members of the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen, worry that the difficulties associated with making changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules are slowing down the development process, but others, such as Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields (who is Andresen’s colleague at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative), feel that the inability to implement controversial changes is a sign of strength in terms of Bitcoin’s level of decentralization.\n\nDuring his interview on The Crypto Show, Dilley compared gridlock in Bitcoin development to gridlock in Congress:\n\n“The differences between political gridlock in Congress and political gridlock in Bitcoin are: One, one doesn’t tax your ****, and two: Bitcoin keeps working.”\n\nDilley’s point was that Bitcoin would keep working in a scenario where complete gridlock happened and no further changes were possible.\n\n“If every person who could develop on Bitcoin died today (and we assume that there are no security flaws that are going to arise tomorrow that need rapid action) ? it will keep working,” he said.\n\nBitcoin Magazine also asked McArdle for his thoughts on political gridlock in Bitcoin. McArdle referred to this as a “fascinating concept” and admitted that he’s divided on this one. He explained:\n\n“On the one hand, I think gridlock is good if initial conditions are set well (which is, of course, subjective). The U.S. federal government, by design, experiences gridlock in order to ensure that only very important changes occur (theoretically). On the other hand, Bitcoin is a technology that doesn't exist in a vacuum or within some physical border. There has to be a good balance between being nimble and being incorruptible. The ecosystem is only beginning to define its best practices.”\n\nAvoiding a Startup-esque Development Process\n\nOne last point made by Dilley on The Crypto Show was that Bitcoin does not use the sort of fast-paced development process that is often found at startups in Silicon Valley. Dilley noted why, in his view, this approach has not been taken by Bitcoin Core contributors:\n\n“We’re talking about $6.5 billion of value, we’re talking about the first attempt for a truly sovereign money. To take an approach where it’s just go as fast as you can until it breaks is not really something that you want to be in place when it comes to Bitcoin.”\n\nDilley also noted that the fast-paced approach may work when developing a new photo-sharing app, but things work differently when you’re talking about people’s money. He added, “If Bitcoin goes dark for six hours, the game is over, and cryptocurrency gets set back 10 years.”\n\nA Crossroads Rather Than a Crisis\n\nAlthough some say Bitcoin currently is in a crisis, McArdle defines the current situation as a crossroads. He told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“There are competing visions for how to upgrade the system and they have different long-term tradeoffs. But on a technical level, either will work, and one (or both) will soon be implemented, so I don't think it's fair to say that this is a full-blown ‘crisis.’”\n\nIn terms of his preference for Bitcoin’s future direction, McArdle added:\n\n“Throwing in the towel on main-chain scaling now, in favor of a ‘settlement-layer’ approach due to the realization that blocksize can't scale forever is a little bit like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.”\n\nMcArdle believes Bitcoin should scale via on-chain and layer-2 solutions.\n\n“It doesn't have to be one or the other,” he said, “and main-chain fees don't have to rise soon, even with significantly increasing usage.”\n\nAs far as the declarations that the Bitcoin experiment is over, McArdle finds such claims to be vastly premature and more-or-less absurd. Although he’s concerned that many in the Bitcoin ecosystem are willing to accept higher on-chain fees, ignore the competitive landscape and opt for more complex solutions (at least in his view), he added, “None of that means Bitcoin is failing by any means.”\n\nMcArdle shared these final thoughts on Bitcoin’s crossroads moment:"", ""Mexican drug cartels generate a lot of profit in the USA, which is one of their main markets. How is this money transferred back to Mexico?\n\nBanks – the old favourite\n\nIn the past, drug cartels had cozy relationships with banks, which facilitated the transfer of drug proceeds.\n\nIn 2012, HSBC reached a $1.9 Bn agreement with the United States admitting that it had enabled Mexican drug cartels to launder billions of dollars through its counters. The charges include failure to monitor more than $670 Bn of wire transfers and more than $9Bn of purchases of US dollars from HSBC Mexico.\n\nThe families of US citizens killed by Mexican drug cartels are suing HSBC, alleging that HSBC's actions led to the destruction of multiple lives.\n\nGold is in vogue\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report published in May 2016, the Sinaloa cartel used some of the proceeds from selling drugs in the US to buy gold from pawn shops. This gold was then shipped to a company in Florida, which falsified paperwork to make it appear that the gold was purchased from companies in Mexico. This gold was then sold in the market, and the proceeds were remitted to the companies in Mexico after the deduction of commission.\n\nAn elaborate money laundering scheme was given the appearance of a legitimate trade transaction.\n\nBitcoins?\n\nBitcoin is often mentioned in a negative light due to its pseudonymous nature and its use in darknet websites to buy illegal goods.\n\nWhile individuals might use Bitcoins to buy drugs anonymously from the internet, its overall relevance to the movement of drug money is low.\n\nSarah Meiklejohn, a computer scientist at University College London, says to Science Magazine:\n\n“It’s difficult to push large amounts of Bitcoin secretly through mixing services. It’s extremely noticeable no matter how you do it. If you catch a dealer with drugs and cash on the street, you’ve caught them committing one crime. But if you catch people using something like Silk Road, you’ve uncovered their whole criminal history. It’s like discovering their books.”\n\nNumbers tell the story – the global drug trade is estimated to be between $300 Bn and $400 Bn, while the value of all Bitcoins in circulation is less than $7Bn.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cannot be one of the major means for drug lords to transfer money, given their limited market capitalization."", 'The court-appointed receiver for Cryptsy, the defunct, Florida-based cryptocurrency exchange that claims to have lost more than $5 million in investors’ funds to theft, has filed a report that identifies some of the banks and exchanges the defendants used in operating the scheme that left hundreds of investors without access to their accounts.\n\nThe receiver, James D. Sallah, an attorney for Miami, Fla.-based Payton & Associates LLC, filed the report in the U.S. District Court Southern District of Florida.\n\nThe court appointed Sallah as receiver last month in response to an investor lawsuit and gave him control of Cryptsy’s assets, CCN reported.\n\nInvestors Want Answers\n\nThe class action suit was filed on behalf of Brandon Leidel, Michael Wilson and “all others similarly situated” against Project Investors, Inc., doing business as Cryptsy, and Paul Vernon and Lorie Ann Nettles. The plaintiffs claim Vernon, Cryptsy’s principal, closed the company’s operations and fled to China with approximately $5 million in cryptocurrencies and investor funds.\n\nInvestors claim they have not been able to access their Cryptsy accounts and that Vernon and Nettles (now his ex-wife) purchased a home in Delray Beach for $1,374,881 in cash from Cryptsy-derived funds. Nettles later received the property in a divorce settlement from Vernon.\n\nSallah, a former Securities & Exchange senior counsel, has sought to secure wallet, account and bank records in Cryptsy’s name. He gained access to business records after subpoenaing various parties.\n\nA First Month Update\n\nThe purpose of his first report is to advise the court and investors what he has done since assuming receivership one month ago. He said his investigation is still in the early stage, and he expects to file a second report in 90 days.\n\n“We continue to be concerned that our clients’ investments and portfolios at Cryptsy are still missing,” David Silver, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told CCN.\n\nSadly, Mr. Vernon, to the best of my knowledge, is still in hiding. He has not provided any cooperation to either myself or the receiver.\n\nSilver, who said he has spoken to hundreds of plaintiffs, said Vernon remains in hiding and apparently is running another exchange in China called BiteBi9.\n\n“While we are trying to do everything we can to protect our clients’ interests, we are limited in what we can do,” Silver said.\n\nNo Access To Accounts\n\nSallah confirmed in his report that investors do not have access to their Cryptsy accounts and that significant amounts of funds are missing and/or possibly locked in Cryptsy servers that he’s trying to access. He also confirmed that Cryptsy is no longer operating.\n\nSallah said he has not received any cooperation from Vernon. He demanded an accounting of the missing funds from Vernon in a letter, but has received no response. He said he has gained some cooperation from former Cryptsy employees.\n\nHe is trying to find all of the investors and determine what they are owed. He is also trying to find out which investors made money, how much, and when, as well as which received money back.\n\nSallah noted he has spoken with investors daily. He said he will try to determine how investors can be repaid what they are owed. If any investors improperly profited, he will try to see that the profits are returned and take legal action if necessary.\n\nThe receiver also said he will contact the landlord of the premises in Delray Beach where Cryptsy operated. He said there are presently no computers, furniture or equipment to secure unless it was relocated, which he will continue to investigate.\n\nProperty Ownership At Issue\n\nSallah demanded information from Nettles on the source of funds used to purchase the property she is living at. He said that the property was derived from Cryptsy and should be in receivership. He has filed a “lis pendens” on the property on behalf of the investors.\n\nSallah said his legal action is needed to stop Nettles from selling the property, which she has been trying to do since her divorce. The property is on the market for $1.5 million. If Nettles doesn’t cooperate concerning the property, Sallah said he will seek a summary judgment on the matter.\n\nSallah said Nettles also drives an Infiniti QX80 SUV purchased for $82,353.66 with Cryptsy-derived funds. He said this also should be in receivership.\n\nIn April, Nettles produced more than 1,800 pages of documents in response to Sallah’s information request. Sallah said he will subpoena TD Bank for missing bank records. He noted that Nettles indicated she will cooperate in producing the bank records.\n\nMore Answers Sought\n\nOne alleged Cryptsy shareholder, Kaushal Majmudar, allegedly held 10% in Cryptsy and provided consulting services. Majmudar is a managing partner of a New Jersey investment firm, Ridgewood Investments. Sallah said he demanded Majmudar provide an investor list and information on funds he received from Cryptsy. Majmudar produced the documents.\n\nSallah also subpoenaed TD Bank, where Vernon and Nettles had at least one personal bank account. He requested the bank freeze any Cryptsy accounts and provide bank records. The bank produced some records.\n\nSallah made similar demands at SunTrust Bank, where Cryptsy had at least one account.\n\nCryptsy update: Court freezes Cryptsy’s assets, appoints receiver\n\nBitcoin Businesses Queried\n\nSallah has also requested information from bitcoin businesses that conducted business with Cryptsy.\n\nHe subpoenaed Coinbase, which Cryptsy used to conduct business, and requested Coinbase freeze Cryptsy accounts, wallets or funds. Coinbase froze some remaining bitcoin(s) in Cryptsy wallets and sent Sallah a check for $24.66.\n\nCoinbase also produced some records concerning three Cryptsy wallets.\n\nSallah also subpoenaed Bittrex LLC, a digital currency exchange, and asked it to freeze any Cryptsy accounts and provide information about Cryptsy accounts. Bittrex froze a wallet with at least $100,000.\n\nOne of Sallah’s associates received an anonymous email in April claiming Cryptsy’s servers were located at Vault Networks Inc. in Miami. Sallah said he demanded Vault Networks confirm whether it has Cryptsy’s servers. In the meantime, he confirmed on his own that Vault Network has Cryptsy’s servers.\n\nVault Networks, in response to a court order, agreed to provide access to Cryptsy’s severs. Sallah said he will try to determine wallet information and will try to secure funds for investors’ benefit.\n\nSallah further found that Digital Ocean was the Internet service provider for the Cryptsy website. Sallah requested Digital Ocean add his name and appointment as receiver with contact information on the Cryptsy website.\n\nHe said he will contact accounting firms that worked with Cryptsy to determine the status of its tax returns for the years prior to receivership.\n\nThe receiver noted he will likely establish a website to keep investors abreast of his progress.\n\nSilver added:\n\nWhere are you Paul Vernon, and why aren’t you helping the customers who trusted you and who represent the very community of cryptocurrency users without whom your business – and the fortune you took from them – would never exist?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
05/12/2016,"['As Bitcoin blocks get closer to full capacity, some members of the community are claiming many of the transactions on the network are nothing more than spam.\n\nDefining a spam transaction on the Bitcoin network is somewhat difficult. In fact, Mastering Bitcoin author Andreas Antonopoulos believes it’s impossible for such transactions to exist.\n\nAccording to Antonopoulos, the fact that someone is willing to pay the fee associated with a particular transaction means that the transaction is not spam by default. During a meetup at Paralelni Polis in Prague, Czech Republic, Antonopoulos explained his position on spam transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nA Top-Down Approach to Spam\n\nAntonopoulos noted there are two approaches that can be taken:\n\n“One is a paternalistic, top-down approach that says, ‘This is what is allowed. This is what is not allowed, and by making a list, we will prevent the network from filling to capacity.’”\n\nIn Antonopoulos’ view, this sort of approach would break net neutrality, which he believes applies to Bitcoin; but the reality is that Bitcoin does not work on net neutrality as a requirement. For example, the Eligius mining pool applies a penalty or simply will not mine some transactions it considers to be spam.\n\nAntonopoulos also explained how picking out spam with a top-down approach would cause Bitcoin to miss out on potential new applications of the blockchain. He noted:\n\n“If we start making decisions about what is spam and what is not, we are now choosing the future of Bitcoin and constraining it according to a set of applications that only we can imagine. And the brilliant person who creates the application we can’t imagine ? that maybe looked like spam to us ? doesn’t get carried across the network because we made the top-down decision to say that transaction is illegitimate.”\n\nIf You Pay the Fee, the Transaction Is Not Spam\n\nAntonopoulos said that any transaction a user attaches a fee to is legitimate by definition. He added, “The very act of paying the fee legitimizes the transaction.”\n\nAntonopoulos also explained how the market for block space allows miners to prioritize some transactions over others. He stated:\n\n“Use the market to solve this problem, and allow the market to establish the minimum fee that meets the requirements of supply through the miners and their need for propagating blocks fast, and the demand of the users for the applications they care about. And if you pay the fee, your transaction is legitimate.”\n\nAntonopoulos went as far as to say the existence of this market means there is no such thing as a spam transaction in Bitcoin. He explained:\n\n“There is no spam transaction. There is no such thing as an illegitimate transaction. There are only transactions that did get mined and transactions that didn’t have enough fee to get mined.”\n\nSometimes Bitcoin Is Not Needed\n\nPeople want to use the Bitcoin blockchain for many different use cases, but the people who are going to have mostly unconditional access to the blockchain are going to be the ones paying the highest fees. The need for censorship resistance in one’s online transactions is the main use case of the Bitcoin blockchain that is not found anywhere else (outside of altcoins).\n\nAs fees rise, the users who don’t necessarily have to use the Bitcoin blockchain will find alternatives. These alternatives could be off-chain iterations of the current Bitcoin network. Those who require the use of a public blockchain will pay the higher fees.', 'One of the early pioneers of bitcoin and blockchain is raising money to fund a financial startup based on the virtual currency.\n\nNick Szabo, a cryptographer who worked on an early bitcoin prototype called DigiCash, is in talks to raise $3 million, according to sources and a pitch deck reviewed by Quartz.\n\nAccording to a person familiar with the effort, $1 million of the seed round has already been committed by Fenbushi Capital, a China-based venture capital firm focused on blockchain investments. Over the past few months, the fundraising effort has been aimed at venture capital firms focused on bitcoin and blockchain.\n\nSzabo is perhaps best known as the father of “smart contracts,” blockchain-based agreements that execute automatically. The technology has recently attracted the attention of large financial institutions like JPMorgan, UBS, and Barclays, as a way to automate traditional back office processes and cut costs.\n\nSzabo has even periodically been thought to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious individual who is credited with creating bitcoin. In May 2015, the New York Times’ Nathaniel Popper wrote that evidence pointed to Szabo being Nakamoto. Szabo denied this to Popper. In recent weeks, Australian software engineer and entrepreneur Craig Wright stepped forward, declaring that he is Nakamoto, though many in the bitcoin community remain skeptical of Wright’s claims.\n\nJoining Szabo in the new company—the reviewed portion of the deck does not clearly lay out what it will be called—is Donald McIntyre, an entrepreneur and former executive at Morgan Stanley and UBS. McIntyre’s LinkedIn profile lists him as cofounder and COO of Global Financial Access, Inc. (The opening slide of the deck says simply, “Access”.)\n\n“Our purpose is to help people everywhere access assets issued anywhere in the world,” McIntyre’s LinkedIn profile says of Global Financial Access.\n\nNeither McIntyre nor Szabo offered a comment, after being contacted by Quartz. Fenbushi did return an email asking for comment.\n\nAccording to the description of the company included in the pitch deck, the new company will be focused using smart contracts on the blockchain to create financial products that mimic traditional assets such as equity index funds, bonds and commodities. The deck suggests the company could create blockchain-based products that mimic the price of underlying assets like Treasury bonds, German bunds, gold and S&P 500 ETFs. Buyers would be able to purchase the blockchain assets using bitcoin. The firm is aiming to have roughly $20 billion in assets under management by 2021, according to the deck.\n\nThe company appears aimed at catering to people from emerging markets interested in buying financial products using bitcoin. The deck prominently cites data on outflows from emerging markets as well as an “opportunity to focus initially on Latin American markets to satisfy need for stable investable assets.”', 'Earlier this week, a press release for a Hong Kong-based company called CoinFac began circulating a plan to ""introduce the next generation quantum computing technology into cryptocurrency mining"".\n\nThe pitch promised big processing speed increases thanks to the claimed technology advances, and visitors to the CoinFac website are quickly directed to a series of cloud mining contract options. Though the website shows that contracts costing 50 BTC and 100 BTC annually are “sold out”, the site is still selling contracts costing 1 BTC and 5 BTC, respectively.\n\nBut at least one claim in the press release appears to be false.\n\nCoinFac stated that it was owned by Palantir Technologies, a secretive data analysis software company co-founded in 2004 by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that originally drew funding from a CIA-connected venture fund.\n\nThe release stated:\n\n""CoinFac Limited, a technology company established 2016 in Hong Kong is owned by Palantir Technologies Incorporation, a private American software and services company, specializing in data analysis and technological software research. Founded in 2004, Palantir\'s is currently the top 30 most valuable companies in Silicon Valley with a valuation of $15 Billion USD reported in 2015.""\n\nYet Palantir is denying involvement with the firm. In an email to CoinDesk, Palantir representative Matt Long said that CoinFac’s claim is inaccurate.\n\n""Palantir has no affiliation,"" Long told CoinDesk.\n\nThis relationship is further claimed on the CoinFac site’s ""About Us"" page, which even includes a picture of Thiel. The page also details the firm’s founder, a man listed as Michael Howzeris, who is said to have held positions at major tech firms like Google, Intel and Oracle.\n\nYet, attempts to confirm this information via public search only result in links to the CoinFac page.\n\nThe release also claims that the firm is ""in close talk [sic]"" with Google, Microsoft and NASA, the US agency devoted to space exploration.\n\nIn a statement, a representative for NASA also denied any involvement.\n\n""NASA has not been in any discussions whatsoever with any cryptocurrency companies regarding the possible integration of quantum computing into their existing products and platform,"" spokesperson Kimberly Williams told CoinDesk.\n\nCoinFac did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThis piece has been updated.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Without exposing any intentions to the public, the large volume trades tend to have no effect on the exchange value of the currency.\n\nIn an email communicated to CCN, Kraken points to the meteoric rise in ether’s value, up nearly 10 times, since the beginning of 2016.\n\nHaving introduced dark pool trading for bitcoin in June 2015, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell sees the present to be the perfect time to enable the feature for trading the currency behind Ethereum.\n\n“This year, trading volume for ether has dramatically increased on Kraken’s exchange, and we developed the Ether Dark Pool to bridge the gap between our lit order books and over-the-counter desk,” Powell stated.\n\nHe also revealed the minimum limit for a large trade order via Kraken’s Dark Pool.\n\nDark Pool trading allows for orders to be placed out of sight so that traders can make large buy or sell orders (minimum of 50 bitcoin or 2,500 ether) without revealing their sentiment to other traders. Advantages include reduced market impact and better price for larger blocks.\n\nWith the launch, clients will be able to trade ether in six currency pairs via the Dark Pool. The currencies with which ether can be exchanged or traded are: bitcoin (ETH/XBT.d), euro (ETH/EUR.d), United States dollar (ETH/USD.d), Canadian dollar (ETH/CAD.d), pound sterling (ETH/GBP.d), and Japanese yen (ETH/JPY.d).\n\nFees for trading via the Ether Dark Pool range from 0.20% to 0.36%, depending on trade volume. The fees are in line with other Kraken dark pools, including the bitcoin dark pool.\n\nIn addition to the announcement, Kraken has also deemed Ether a collateral currency for its Margin Trading program. A client’s Ether balance can now be used (much like a bitcoin, Euro or USD balance) as collateral for the borrowed funds associated to a leveraged margin trade in Kraken’s program.\n\nPowell explained the difference between the two features offered by Kraken:\n\nIf traders are looking to move large sizes without affecting the market, they trade dark on Kraken. If traders want to keep fewer assets on account and they want less exposure to funding delays, they trade with margin on Kraken.\n\nAs things stand, however, margin trading is unavailable to US residents.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Following the impressive rise of the Bitcoin digital currency over the past few years, criminals are stepping up their game.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar, Bitcoin is an open-source software code that offers a person-to-person (P2P) monetary exchange with no central servers. It uses mathematics, cryptography, and blockchain technology to facilitate transactions easily, quickly, and securely.\n\nUsers store a collection of keys ? an e-wallet ? on their computer for saving, sending, and receiving payments through the Bitcoin network. Transactions are protected by highly encrypted algorithms.\n\nUnlike traditional currency, Bitcoin isn’t regulated by a central authority. That’s the appeal – it’s free from the meddling and manipulation of central banks.\n\nAnyone can “mine” Bitcoins by solving algorithms that are available to the public. But this is regulated through in-built technology. As a user learns to “mine,” the process becomes increasingly difficult – so much so that Bitcoin mining is reduced by roughly 50% every four years and it’s impossible to exceed the existence of 21 million Bitcoins in circulation at any given time.\n\nBut as with any digital content these days, Bitcoin is vulnerable to cyber criminals willing to exploit security vulnerabilities in the system.\n\nBitcoin Bandits\n\nSoon after Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, the creators of malware giant Zeus Botnet began using the currency for transactions. WikiLeaks and countless drug trafficking sites also revealed their adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin’s P2P network makes it difficult to detect criminal transactions, discover the identity of users, or acquire transaction records of illicit money transfers.\n\nIn case of breaches, security companies are typically able to provide an electronic trail, which the law uses to trace activities in the real world and locate criminals. However, by leveraging the decentralized Bitcoin system, criminals are less detectable in both the virtual world, as well as the real world, making prosecution more difficult.\n\nAnd, this issue applies to all cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin. Recently, cyber criminals began using a currency called Liberty Reserve (LR), which offered users a platform for transferring funds to other users with just their email, name, and date of birth as proof of identity.\n\nBut no effort was made to validate the identities used, no limits were set on the transactions, and most forms of deposit were honored. A money-laundering paradise!\n\nIn May 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice charged LR with laundering $6 billion, and its founder was arrested along with six others. According to the New York Southern District Court attorney, “Liberty Reserve was intentionally created and structured to facilitate criminal activity; it was essentially a black market bank.”\n\nBut because of its vast legitimate uses, Bitcoin remains the digital currency leader.\n\nBitcoin Users Unite\n\nThe security team at IBM’s Security Intelligence Division recently came across a discussion in a closed Russian cyber-crime forum in which members debated the use of different virtual currencies, secure transactions, and Bitcoin.\n\nThe thread included a discussion on users’ preferred money exchanges to make secure online transactions, as well as the volatility of Bitcoin.\n\nThe key takeaway was that while all members were obviously concerned with security, they were all avid supporters of virtual currencies.\n\nAnd given its status at the forefront of the digital currency industry, supporters dominated the conversation. They highlighted the ease with which transactions can be made, the increased security measures available to them, and Bitcoin’s increasing adoption rate among merchants.\n\nIndeed, the number of merchants who accept Bitcoin has risen to over 100,000 last year. That includes Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), PayPal, and Expedia Inc. (EXPE) – proof that far from being just an upstart, Bitcoin is actually moving to the mainstream.\n\nThe members also dismissed Bitcoin’s volatility. Noting that while the digital currency may go down in value, they usually regain their value and eventually become more expensive.\n\nThat being said, with increasing interest in Bitcoin from businesses, entrepreneurs, private users, and cyber criminals, security threats will continue to grow, too.\n\nThe Future of Cryptocurrency\n\nBut despite this, analysts and investors continue to laud Bitcoin.\n\nAnd as various Bitcoin-related startups and partnerships come online, greater consumer safeguards are also coming onto the market.\n\nAnd while the inherently cryptic nature of Bitcoin makes it difficult to back-up or insure, there are implementations that could provide users more confidence. For instance, Wall Street Daily correspondent Shelley Goldberg recently reported on how the Ethereum network allows users to create cyber contracts where they can regulate and understand transactions.\n\nThese smaller companies, like Ethereum, are incredibly valuable as cryptocurrencies continue to grow. They offer viable alternatives and competition to Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, with Bitcoin’s value fluctuating – from $13 to higher than the price of gold in November 2013 – following major related events, such as the shutdown of Tor-based drugstore Silk Road or the attacks on major exchanges, contracts will become even more important for the average user.\n\nAs with any investment, it’s crucial to understand the pros, cons, and risks before getting involved – either as a user or investor. And that’s particularly true in the growing, but still murky world of digital currency.\n\nGood investing,\n\nSarah Adler', '', 'The National Diet in Japan (the legislature consisting of the Lower House and the Upper House) is currently deliberating over bills to regulate bitcoin and other virtual currencies and a keenly contested bitcoin industry in Japan is watching closely.\n\nFollowing the debacle of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox which collapsed in 2014, bitcoin as a currency had a PR problem, particularly in Japan. The government stepped in and sought to establish certain guidelines to regulate the cryptocurrency. Before regulation comes recognition and bitcoin is set to be seen as a currency, similar to fiat, centralized money.\n\nSuch plans came to fruition early in 2016, when the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) considered legislative revisions that would recognize digital currencies as equivalents to conventional currencies. And so it came to be. Early March saw Japan’s cabinet passing a set of bills to deem virtual currencies as having similar functions to real money. These bills sought to revise laws such as the Banking Act and Payment Service Act, which sees virtual currencies having “asset-like” properties.\n\nThe legislation will require virtual currency exchanges to register with the FSA and follow know-your-customer (KYC) practices which will seek user identification at the time of registration.\n\nOther speculated regulations, and considerations include:\n\nBringing registered cryptocurrency exchanges under Japan’s anti-money-laundering laws.\n\nMandating exchange operators meet certain pre-set financial conditions such as having a minimum amount of capital.\n\nAnother stipulation may include requiring operators manage customer assets separately from corporate assets. This would also help with clarity in the case of bankruptcy.\n\nMandatory external checks from certified public accountants or auditing firms that exchange operators will have to undergo.\n\nOperators will also be obliged to report questionable trading patterns to authorities.\n\nTransaction records will have to be maintained and stored by operators.\n\nOperators will also be responsible for security measures and the computer systems required to protect their users’ information.\n\nBitcoin Operators Welcome Regulation\n\nNow, bitcoin operators and entrepreneurs are keeping tabs as the Diet deliberates over the bills in the Upper House currently. The bills have already passed through the Lower House in April.\n\nAs reported by the Japan Times, the virtual currency industry believes that legislation and regulation are key for the industry’s growth and importantly, to gain the public’s trust back.\n\nMike Kayamoro, CEO of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Quoine told the publication that Japan’s endeavor to recognize and establish legality with bitcoin is “epoch-making.”\n\nYuzo Kano, CEO of leading Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange bitFlyer, a startup that saw the largest funding round ever by a bitcoin company in Japan with a successful ¥3 billion ($27 million) funding round stated:\n\nIt [the regulations] will help improve the trust in the virtual currency. I am hoping the new rules will stimulate the growth of the industry.\n\nKano also added that the bitcoin industry in Japan will get a boost when bigger companies and investors take notice of the cryptocurrency, beyond the startups that currently occupy the space in a market still in its infancy.\n\n“Nobody is really making a profit,” Kano revealed, with plenty of startups vying for a share of the popular pie that is the bitcoin industry in Japan.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'About The Author\n\nEduardo Gómez is a Computer Science Major from Venezuela, a country with a loyal Bitcoin user base.

Since the cryptocurrency’s inception in 2008, all the bitcoins in circulation have grown from being worth nothing to a value of nearly $7 billion today.\n\nAlong the way, however, bitcoin helped fuel the rise of the Silk Road, a globe-spanning black market for narcotics and other contraband that prompted a major clampdown by US authorities. Its founder, Ross Ulbricht (also known as the “Dread Pirate Roberts”), is currently facing two consecutive life sentences.\n\nToday, the open-source technology is in the midst of a “civil war” among its top developers that threatens to stifle its growth, while convoluted paternity claims pop up on an almost annual basis.\n\nThat’s why bitcoin has been declared dead 101 times, according to one estimate by bitcoin guide 99 Bitcoins.\n\nBut even as dozens of obituaries for the digital currency appear annually, its price has proved resilient.

05/13/2016,"['If you are interested in dipping a toe in the waters of the digital currency bitcoin, the easiest way is to buy some bitcoin, and arguably the best-known service for that is Coinbase.\n\nThe company launched four years ago today, and was one of the earliest bitcoin wallets—that is, simply, a place to buy and hold bitcoin. By being early to the craze, Coinbase became one of the most recognizable and respected brands in the bitcoin industry, it raised nearly $107 million in venture capital (by far the most raised by any bitcoin startup until 21 Inc. came along), and its co-founders, Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, became influential names in the business.\n\nLately, the narrative about the bitcoin world has shifted to blockchain, the decentralized, peer-to-peer, open-source technology that powers bitcoin. (For an explainer, check out this video.) The idea of blockchain came about side-by-side with bitcoin in 2009, but now major banks and financial institutions are gaga over the idea of using blockchains to speed up their transaction processing—closed, private blockchains without bitcoin.\n\nNow some of the hottest startups that started out as “bitcoin companies” have subtly edged away from bitcoin in their marketing. Bitreserve, a cloud bank that allows you to hold funds in many different currencies, changed its name to Uphold; Circle, which started as a bitcoin payment app, added the ability to deposit funds in U.S. dollars, and no longer mention bitcoin on its home page. Many bitcoin companies are focusing on blockchain and working with new partners who, in many cases, have no interest in a volatile cryptocurrency.\n\nBut Coinbase and its leaders are more bullish on bitcoin than ever.\n\n“I think the whole narrative of blockchain without bitcoin will amount to very little,” declares Fred Ehrsam. In an interview with Yahoo Finance during the big bitcoin conference Consensus this month, Ehrsam compared the current craze over blockchain to corporations that rushed to create “intranets” in the early days of the Internet—they were closed networks, accessible only to one company’s employees. And while those still exist at some companies today, most people eventually realized that they didn’t need to create private corners of the Internet, because the large, open Internet is good enough.\n\nIt is a popular comparison among bitcoin believers at the moment. Many people on the banking side of things, in visits with Yahoo Finance, have been dismissive of that dismissiveness. They see potential in blockchain technology to reduce friction in payments overseas, and maybe even speed the settlement of stock purchases.\n\nEhrsam’s point is that the bitcoin blockchain can already do that. A former Goldman Sachs (GS) foreign exchange trader, Ehrsam brings financial chops to bitcoin, a world which many of the most fervent supporters got into because they are anti-banking and anti-government. Ehrsam has said he aims for Coinbase to be a Goldman Sachs of cryptocurrency. Some in bitcoin would say it’s already there.\n\nCoinbase has grown far beyond a mere bitcoin wallet: It has more than 2 million users; it is now operable in 32 countries; it recently launched the ability for U.S. customers to buy bitcoin instantly using a debit card (previously you had to link up a bank account and wait a few days, which was a nice illustration of the sluggishness of traditional banking); and most significantly, last year it launched an entirely new business: a bitcoin exchange.\n\nCoinbase has major competition among bitcoin exchanges. Many, many exchanges have sprung up in the past two years, including one from the Winklevoss brothers, Gemini, which last year scored regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services to operate as a trust, and this month got new approval to add the ability for customers to trade Ether, a much-hyped alternative digital-currency to bitcoin. Coinbase, in contrast with Gemini, did not wait for regulatory approval in New York before launching. But a report just this week from Reuters suggests the NYDFS is set to grant Coinbase a BitLicense anyway, which, if true, will certainly make Coinbase look like it was smart not to wait. After a little over one year in business, Coinbase says it has the most liquid bitcoin exchange in the U.S.', 'Although Bitcoin has been around for more than seven years now, there are still plenty of myths about this technology percolating among the general public and the mainstream press. Bitcoin is sometimes a difficult subject to grasp because it requires a basic understanding of many different areas of study such as cryptography, economics and computer science.\n\nHere are ten different popular myths about Bitcoin that still generate discussion in 2016.\n\n1. Bitcoin Is Dead\n\nThe most common myth that people repeat about Bitcoin is that it is dead and no longer used by anyone in the world. There is a website, Bitcoin Obituaries, which keeps track of the declarations of Bitcoin’s death going all the way back to 2010. At that time, bitcoin was trading at $0.23.\n\nIn reality, Bitcoin is currently at its most successful point in history -- at least when measured by the number of transactions that are happening on the network every day. The real problem right now is scalability (increasing block size to handle more transactions), which Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce recently pointed out is a sign of its success.\n\n2. Bitcoin Is Anonymous\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is often referred to as the “anonymous currency of the dark web,” it is more correct to say that Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous. This means that there is an identifiable address (or many addresses) for each user on the network, but no one necessarily knows who is behind each address.\n\nWith Bitcoin, it’s important to remember that every transaction is recorded on a completely public ledger that anyone can view on a block explorer. A few blockchain analytics companies have popped up over the past few years, and they’re able to deanonymize large portions of the network.\n\n3. Bitcoin Is Completely Transparent\n\nIt’s also a myth that Bitcoin is completely transparent. As mentioned in the above section, the true identities of the individuals or organizations behind specific Bitcoin addresses are not always known. There are also various privacy-enhancing services, such as JoinMarket, which allow users to enhance their privacy on the blockchain. There are also other enhancements, such as Confidential Transactions and Zerocash, that could come to Bitcoin in due time.\n\nRather than being completely anonymous or completely transparent, Bitcoin is better identified as somewhere between these two extremes.\n\n4. Bitcoin Is Used by Terrorists\n\nWhenever Bitcoin is brought up in a movie or television show, it’s almost always being used by some kind of serious criminal or terrorist; however there is no evidence of terrorists using Bitcoin on any noteworthy scale. In fact, a Europol investigation from earlier in the year found, “Despite third-party reporting suggesting the use of anonymous currencies like Bitcoin by terrorists to finance their activities, this has not been confirmed by law enforcement.”\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is sometimes used for illegal transactions on the Internet, the reality is that the privacy issues related to the public blockchain make it a poor choice for terrorists. In the world of untraceable payments, cash is still king. The Winklevoss Twins, who founded a Bitcoin exchange called Gemini, have gone as far as to say Bitcoin is a haven for really stupid criminals.\n\n5. Bitcoin Is Not Backed By Anything, So It Has No Value\n\nMany gold bugs and those who do not understand the value of a decentralized, censorship-resistant digital payment network believe bitcoins are essentially worthless because they aren’t backed by anything. There are varying opinions on this point. Some believe bitcoin’s scarcity is the main attribute that gives it value, while others claim bitcoins are useful because they are required to use the world’s most prominent and secure decentralized ledger.\n\nCurrency Wars author and gold bull Jim Rickards recently took issue with the argument that bitcoins are backed by nothing, pointing out that like all currency in the history of money, bitcoins are backed by confidence. (Also known as consensus.) Gold is valuable because people agree that it is.\n\n6. Bitcoin’s Price Volatility Makes It Useless\n\nWhile Bitcoin has had quite a volatile history, the trend has definitely been toward stability since the first blocks were mined in early 2009. Having said that, not many people are attempting to use bitcoin as a unit of account right now. Instead, the digital currency, commodity or however you want to define it is mainly viewed as a store of value by those who hold it.\n\nThere are also various mechanisms for using the Bitcoin network for payments while avoiding the volatility associated with the token of value. Some Bitcoin companies, such as Circle and Coinbase, allow users to store funds in U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies before making Bitcoin transactions on the user’s behalf.\n\n7. Bitcoin Is a Ponzi Scheme\n\nBitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme for these reasons:\n\nA Ponzi scheme requires an initial founder who persuades investors that they’ll make some sort of profit. There is no central point of power in Bitcoin, as it’s a decentralized system, so no promises of profits are made by the network. A Ponzi scheme always requires new investors to pay off earlier investors. This is not the case with Bitcoin, as the system can work with practically any number of users. However, the network is stronger and more resilient when used by more people. If Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then all other forms of money were also initially developed as Ponzi schemes.\n\n8. Bitcoin Is Only Used for Illegitimate Purposes\n\nOne of the fundamental values of Bitcoin is its resistance to censorship. As Elon Musk put it in 2014:\n\n“I think it’s primarily going to be a means of doing illegal transactions. But that’s not necessarily entirely bad. You know, some things maybe shouldn’t be illegal.”\n\nWhat is or isn’t a legitimate or legal transaction can change when moving between various jurisdictions, but Bitcoin is also used for completely legal purposes. Some people use Bitcoin to save 10-20 percent on purchases at Amazon, Starbucks and Target via Foldapp and Purse.io. Others see it as a valuable tool for cheaper international money transfers and remittances. Abra, Align Commerce and Freemit are three startups using Bitcoin to lower the costs of money transfers around the world.\n\n9. Bitcoin Mining Wastes Electricity\n\nA recent report found that Bitcoin’s network hashrate could consume as much power as Denmark by 2020. Other reporters dispute this characterization, pointing out that Bitcoin uses the same electricity as the yearly consumption of 674.5 average American homes, two Amtrak locomotives or a California hydroelectric plant. Do these things waste electricity? It depends on your point of view. The reality is that the use of computing power serves a purpose in Bitcoin, which is securing all of the transactions on the network. If you don’t think Bitcoin is valuable, maybe that’s a waste. If you don’t think fiat currencies are valuable, maybe keeping the lights on at the Federal Reserve is a waste.\n\nElectricity-intensive Bitcoin mining is essentially a way to prove that someone has expended resources in hopes of getting a block reward and transaction fees in return for their efforts. Proof-of-work, as it’s called, acts as a prevention mechanism against Sybil attacks (forged identities) on the Bitcoin network. Waste? You decide.\n\n10. The CEO of Bitcoin Was Arrested\n\nWhen the general public reads about Bitcoin, the connection is often made with Silk Road or Mt. Gox. Many people actually thought it was Bitcoin that was shut down by the F.B.I. in 2013, and not the anonymous online black market (Silk Road); or that it was Bitcoin that collapsed in early 2014, and not the failed Bitcoin exchange (Mt. Gox). The inability to make the distinction between Bitcoin and the companies or services built on top of it has been a huge problem for the digital currency in terms of education.\n\nBecause of this inability to distinguish between Bitcoin and Bitcoin companies, many people thought the CEO of Bitcoin had been arrested in the cases of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem. Of course, the reality is that there is no CEO of Bitcoin.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011. His work has been featured on VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, RT’s Keiser Report, and many other media outlets. You can follow @kyletorpey on Twitter.', 'Before 21 Inc. had even put out a product, it had raised $121 million in venture funding—the most of any bitcoin company. It was unclear, for months, what 21 would actually do or make. But some of the biggest names in fintech funding, including Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures, and the Winklevoss brothers, were interested enough to invest.\n\nThen things started to move very quickly. In February, 21 released its first product—and it was hardware, a rarity among bitcoin companies. It was the 21 bitcoin computer, which allows for mining the cryptocurrency as well as building applications on top of the bitcoin blockchain, the open-source, decentralized ledger that underlies bitcoin.\n\nThe computer, which runs on Raspberry Pi (a small, single-board programming computer launched in 2012), sells for $400 and is about the length of an iPhone. It attracted a lot of buzz and attention in the bitcoin world.\n\nThe 21.co bitcoin computer More\n\nLast week, at the bitcoin conference Consensus, 21 CEO Balaji Srinivasan, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, moved the company’s purview forward again. He announced that the 21 software can now be installed on any Mac or Linux-compatible system (Windows is coming soon), and eventually will come to mobile phones. “Every computer is now a bitcoin computer,” he said.\n\nAnd this is why 21 is arguably the single most exciting bitcoin company right now.\n\nMost people on Wall Street, as well as regular, everyday investors (and Yahoo Finance readers like you) still don’t quite understand what bitcoin is, or why it matters. Many think it’s a scam or some kind of illegal tool for hackers. (The negative publicity around stories like the Silk Road trial didn’t help.) Srinivasan’s argument is: You don’t need to know what it is or how it works for it to be important to your digital life. He explains it this way to a layperson: “I ask people, ‘Do you use Linux?’ They’ll probably say no. But if you’re using Google.com, or Facebook.com, or Yahoo.com, you actually are using Linux, even if you don’t know it. So Linux is there, everywhere, it’s just behind the scenes, and it just sounds very technical because it solves problems for developers. And I think it’s going to be the same thing with bitcoin.”\n\nSrinivasan frames bitcoin as the next major “system resource” in computing, something that will be a key component in every computer, just like a hard drive, RAM, and bandwidth. Bitcoin, he says, can be the resource that computers trade with other computers (without you having to worry about it), creating a “machine economy.” Once a computer can send a small amount of money as part of its operating system, “it can effectively rent or sell resources to other computers,” Srinivasan says. That was the idea behind the bitcoin computer: “If you had 500 of these things, what could they do together?”\n\nSo, what can they do together?\n\nFor starters, you could earn a small amount of money (yes, in bitcoin, but a wide range of platforms now exist for quickly converting bitcoin to U.S. dollars, if that’s what you’d prefer) every time you visit a certain URL. On stage at Consensus, Srinivasan described it thusly: ""Every time you load a webpage is a HTTP request. That’s a lot of HTTP requests. If you are earning bitcoin on every HTTP request, that could be a lot of earned bitcoins.""\n\n\n\nStory Continues', 'May 13, 2016, Ljubljana, Slovenia – Creditbit is one of the faster growing digital currencies in the cryptocurrency segment. The rapid adoption and development has positioned Creditbit as the ‘Future of Money’.\n\nLaunched in 2015, Creditbit follows the decentralized model like many other digital currency platforms to revolutionize the monetary system. With the platform,Creditbits ultimate goal is to reach out to every individual on the planet, offering them banking and financial services over the blockchain. The conventional banking system comes with its own challenges, which makes it almost impossible for everyone to have his/her own bank account. The challenge is mainly due to the centralized nature of the operation, where there are people and organizations who make the decision for their customers. These decision makers are also the ones who decide whether to provide these aforementioned services to a particular segment of people.\n\nCreditbits open source approach makes it easy for anyone to join the community to use and further develop the Creditbit protocol. Moreover, setting up a Creditbit addresses and making transactions over the platform is completely free. The open source nature of Creditbit doesn’t confine its users to one particular model decided by its creator but it also allows developers to run, modify, copy and even distribute the modified versions of the software. The strong developer community ensures that the platform by itself is constantly evolving, in turn increasing adoption by offering a great user experience. Creditbit is built as a robust platform, with all its source code available on main repos on GitHub.\n\nHow is Creditbit Different from Bitcoin\n\nCreditbit has recognized the challenges faced by Bitcoin and implemented the changes to prevent such issues from repeating on their platform. Creditbit uses a Proof of Work (PoW) hybrid, solving the no-stake-at-stake problem generally faced by the Proof of Stake (PoS) systems. The PoW – PoS hybrid also makes it impossible to use ASICs to mine Creditbit tokens.\n\nThe block generation time for Bitcoin protocol is 10 minutes, which has significantly increased the time taken to confirm transactions. Also, the rate of transactions processed by the Bitcoin protocol is also less due to the same issue. Creditbit has prevented such issues from happening by making it capable of processing transactions ten times faster than the Bitcoin network. The time taken for an average Creditbit transaction to be confirmed is less than 30 seconds, making it the world´s fastest digital currency.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nHashing Algorithm: X11\n\nAlgorithm Type: Hybrid POW/POS, POW only for the first year, POS 8% annually\n\nStake Age: Minimum – 24 hours; Maximum – 1 year\n\nBlock Reward: 100 coin\n\nHalving: For every 129600 Block (the 4th re-target at block 525600 is the end of PoW)\n\nSupply: 100 Million CRBIT (Creditbit tokens)\n\nBlock Target: 1-minute block target; 15 minutes diff. re-target\n\nRPC port: 5555\n\nP2P port: 5556\n\nPOW: 12,3 million coins\n\nPOS: The rest supply until 100 million\n\nAbout Creditbit\n\nCreditbit is an open source cryptocurrency protocol released under MIT/X11 license. The protocol enables implementation of financial services over its blockchain to make it accessible to everyone.\n\nCreditbit has gained a lot of traction since its launch and the Creditbit wallets are currently available for almost all platforms. Creditbit is currently being traded on 7 different exchanges viz., Bittrex, Livecoin, YoBit, C-Cex, Cryptopia, Bloombit, and Bitsquare. Creditbit has also been added to Coin Payments.\n\nCreditbit users can contribute to the network by keeping their wallets open in a process called staking. Staking is rewards with up to 8 percent of the Creditbit holding every year. Staking helps the platform optimize the speed of transactions.\n\nWith increased adoption among individuals, traders and merchants; Creditbit has taken their first steps towards mass adoption.\n\nTo learn more about Creditbit please visit: https://www.creditbit.org\n\nFind Creditbit on different platforms Forum:\n\nCreditbit: https://forum.creditbit.org/\n\nBitcoinTalk ANN: https://Bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1237511.0\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/creditbitofficial/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/creditbit\n\nSlack: https://slack.creditbit.org/\n\nCreditbit ranking and indexing:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/crbit/overview\n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/creditbit\n\nhttp://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/creditbit/\n\nCreditbit is the source of this content.

In the past, BitPagos has become known in the Bitcoin community by enabling merchants in inflation-riddled countries, such as Serrano’s birthplace of Argentina, to convert credit card payments into bitcoins.\n\nThey’ve often been referred to as the opposite of BitPay, which is a Bitcoin payment processor that allows merchants to convert bitcoin payments into local currency within one business day of the sale.\n\nBitPagos’ latest project is an attempt to bring a new type of credit system to the unbanked in countries such as Argentina, where much of the population does not have the ability to shop online. During his presentation, Serrano noted that online commerce accounts for only 2.2 percent of all the shopping taking place in Latin America.\n\nHow Does Ripio Work?\n\nRipio Credit allows its users to pay any bitcoin-accepting merchant in installments denominated in their local currency. After downloading the app, users are put through an application process that involves handing over some identifying information such as a picture of their government-issued ID and a selfie. The information provided by the user is reviewed to determine the creditworthiness of the applicant.\n\nDuring his presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt, Serrano stated, “This is a very difficult problem, but we have been working on these issues for several years ? long before BitPagos.”\n\nSerrano noted that most of the BitPagos team comes from other payment companies in the region such as Mercado Libre. BitPagos is essentially creating a new reputation system to determine whether individuals who usually are not banked (or offered credit) can gain access to credit through their app.\n\nEssentially, BitPagos is making bitcoin payments upfront for their users, while the users are responsible for paying back their purchase via Bitcoin, a bank account or local, physical cash payments.\n\nWhy Use Bitcoin?\n\nAfter his presentation, Serrano was asked to explain why Bitcoin was used at all. Serrano said:\n\n“Bitcoin is, for the merchant, a much better system: It’s instantaneous [and] it has a much lower cost for processing. It also helps us build a [merchant] network that will give a lot more value to the user [from the start].”\n\nAs an example of the efficiencies offered by Bitcoin, Serrano noted that Avalancha, a BitPagos ecommerce partner, offers a 10 percent discount for payments made with bitcoin. Serrano explained that the merchant is willing to give that discount because it is a “better network.”\n\nSerrano continued:\n\n“If [a merchant] processes with a credit card company in Argentina, he will get paid a month later in a country that has 20 percent inflation.”\n\nHow Will BitPagos Fight Fraud?\n\nSerano also was asked how BitPagos’ new app will be able to fight fraud. Serrano noted that fraud is something BitPagos has been battling against for a long time, and he believes it is not going to be a major issue going forward ? mainly due to the company’s experience in the past.\n\n“We know a lot of the [traits] that a fraud user will have,” he said.\n\nSerrano also mentioned that BitPagos’ ability to determine the creditworthiness of a particular user will improve over time as the user’s activity is monitored.\n\nImage via Ripio', 'UPDATE (14th May 11:40 BST): This piece has been updated with a statement from Gatecoin.\n\nHong Kong-based digital currency exchange Gatecoin has reportedly experienced a hack, resulting in losses from its connected wallets.\n\nCEO Aurélien Menant took to the Slack channel for the DigixDAO project yesterdayand indicated that the exchange lost control of bitcoins and ethers, the native token of the Ethereum network, during the incident.\n\nMenant said that tokens tied to the DigixDAO project as well as the Augur and TheDAO projects were unaffected.\n\nThe CEO indicated via Slack that he was not entirely clear on the amount of funds taken, but noted “[the numbers] are big” and that the exchange will seek to refund customers following the loss. Though unconfirmed by any official source, rumors have begun circulating that the losses could be as much as $2m.\n\nIn a statement provided to CoinDesk, Gatecoin said:\n\n""Last night Asia time, we suspected a potential leak on our hot wallets. Therefore, we decided to shut down the exchange and ports in order to minimise further potential losses, and we are conducting a full forensic investigation to identify the root of the issue.

This one.\n\nBefore there was a story about Donald Trump\'s refusal to release his tax returns during an election campaign, Mitt Romney faced a similar issue. Romney eventually released his returns but not before it had been alleged that his documents had been hacked and were being held for ransom: $1 million in Bitcoin (more about Bitcoin here).\n\nWhen the allegations were first released, the story seemed so fantastical that many didn\'t believe it - only it turned out to be true.\n\nThis week, Michael Mancil Brown was convicted of six counts of wire fraud and six counts of using facilities of interstate commerce to commit extortion. Brown claimed that he had been able to access PricewaterhouseCoopers\' internal computer network in order to steal tax documents belonging to Romney. Brown never actually had access to Romney\'s tax returns. Nonetheless, he delivered a letter to PricewaterhouseCoopers offices, demanding payment of $1 million in Bitcoin or, he claimed, he would release the documents. Brown also announced that he would release the tax documents to any third parties willing to pay $1 million in Bitcoin. To make his claims feel authentic, he included a scanned signature image of Mitt Romney\'s signature which was apparently taken from earlier forms 1040.\n\nAs part of the scheme, Brown delivered similar letters to the offices of the Democratic and Republican parties in Franklin, Tennessee, along with a USB drive which he claimed contained an encrypted version of the returns. He printed the letters out using an acquaintance\'s printer (his was out of ink). The arrangements were made using a Hotmail.com account. Yes, in 2012.\n\nBrown also posted similar statements about the allegedly stolen returns on Pastebin.com, a website for sharing text online, under the name ""Dr. Evil"" (admit it, you\'re thinking about Austin Powers now, too). He discussed the alleged theft on at least 300 additional websites.\n\nBrown was initially indicted on 12 charges. He was found guilty of all 12. He is scheduled to be sentenced in August. He faces up to twenty years in prison on the charges of wire fraud, up to five years in prison on the charges of extortion, fines of up to $250,000, and orders of restitution to victims.']"
05/14/2016,"['', 'Bitcoin has matured as an asset and it will eventually be disrupting gold, according to brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who operate the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. The brothers gave their views about digital currency’s future during an interview with Liz Claman on Fox Business Network’s “Countdown Closing Bell.”\n\nClaman was reporting live from the Sky Bridge Alternatives (SALT) Conference in Las Vegas, a conference on macro-economic trends.\n\nClaman introduced the brothers, whom she described as two of bitcoin’s biggest backers, displaying a line chart showing how bitcoin and the U.S. dollar have been trading in opposite directions, with bitcoin trading at a more stable rate. She introduced the brothers noting that their Gemini exchange has been trading for six months.\n\nClaman also played a clip from an October interview with the brothers talking about how cryptocurrency will allow people to exchange currencies at airports without having to pay high exchange fees.\n\nGemini Sets A New Course\n\nThe brothers explained that their Gemini exchange trades both bitcoin and Ether, the latter being the currency of the Ethereum network.\n\nGemini recently received the New York State Department of Financial Services’ approval to trade Ether in addition to bitcoin, CCN reported. The brothers hope their platform will become the “Nasdaq for bitcoin buying and selling.”\n\n“People are definitely knocking on the door; the volume has gone up dramatically in the last few days” in the first three days of trading, Tyler said.\n\nBitcoin Volatility Fades\n\nClaman asked about bitcoin’s volatility, which Cameron said is a thing of the past that was due to regulatory uncertainty. But the advent of licensed exchanges like Gemini have brought a lot more certainty. He said bitcoin has been a lot less volatile recently than gold.\n\n“Bitcoin is acting like a mature asset,” Tyler noted, adding that there is a lot of liquidity. The digital currency has come a long way from its beginning when many people were wary of it over security concerns and its association with criminal activity.\n\nAs for Ether, “Ether is the token of the Ethereum network, which is focused on disrupting contract law. Trading began on Monday and it’s our second cryptocurrency to add to Gemini,” Cameron said.\n\nFirst Licensed Ether Operator\n\n“We are the first ever licensed operator in the world where you can buy and sell bitcoin and Ether, which we think are effectively call options on the future of two major technologies,” Tyler said. He said bitcoin will disrupt gold and the Ethereum network is going to disrupt contract law. “These are the tokens and assets in how to invest in that future.”\n\nClaman said it would seem that the hedge fund world is interested in cryptocurrency, but the banking world might be threatened by it. Cameron responded that he didn’t think the banking world would be threatened by cryptocurrencies. He said fiat currencies are here to stay.\n\nCryptocurrencies To Be The Norm\n\nIn addition to bitcoin disrupting gold, cryptocurrencies will become the norm as the government will control the U.S. dollar, Tyler said.\n\nHe said the dollar will continue to be controlled by the government, but it will go onto its own blockchain.\n\n“I think really what will happen is you’ll use a combination of bitcoin, Ether, your devices, the ‘Internet of Things.’ We’ve got billions of devices coming online. They’ll never exchange value with PayPal, credit cards or ACH [Automated Clearing House], but they will use cryptographic tokens…I think fiat currencies will become digital…Your speed of options will increase. I think fiat currencies will become digital. .. bitcoin will be one piece of that larger puzzle… Cryptocurrency is here to stay. Gemini is a picks and shovels company of that future.”\n\n“Bitcoin’s actually verifiable to the blockchain,” Cameron added. “That’s one of the reasons we think it’s going to disrupt gold.”\n\nWhat About Facebook?\n\nBecause the brothers were involved in the foundation of Facebook, Claman asked them where they stand on free speech, an issue that has been raised about Facebook recently. Some people have claimed that Facebook has suppressed conservative views.\n\n“Free speech is one of the most important principles of our country,” Tyler said.\n\nCameron said Facebook was intended to be an open algorithm, so if Facebook has not lived up to this, he can see why people would be disappointed. The brothers both said they have not paid close attention to everything that people have said about the current Facebook dispute.\n\nFeatured image from Flickr.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'According to the statement posted by one of the Bitcoin Core developers, this change will be made to fight the centralization of Bitcoin mining.\n\nAn interesting statement was posted on Twitter by Olivier Janssens, as he explained an upcoming change in the Bitcoin Core client software. A patented optimization for ASIC mining – called AsicBoost – will be made obsolete in the next client update. That news did not go over well with a lot of members for sure.\n\nBitcoin Core Developers Dislike AsicBoost\n\nThis news is part of a substantial debate on Reddit for the past few days, as the AsicBoost optimization lets Bitcoin miners save roughly 10% on electricity usage and costs. Given the right rates of electricity costs in most parts of the world, a 10% different can make mining more profitable for some users, adding to the decentralisation of this concept.\n\nNote to miners: We, the core devs, discovered a patented optimization in your ASIC. We will make it obsolete in the next update. Thank you. — Olivier Janssens (@olivierjanss) May 13, 2016\n\nAt the same time, this announcement begs the question as to why Bitcoin Core developers want to remove such a feature, as that seems to have an adverse effect. There are some questions asked on Reddit as to why is behind this decision, and the name Blockstream is coming up several times as the potential instigators of this upcoming change.\n\nPeople who have been mining Bitcoin for some time now will know how the mining difficulty has gone up by a significant margin in the past few months. The apparent reason for this ramping difficulty spike is due to more people mining, or at least more hardware being deployed. Still, a 10% boost to require less electricity while mining is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nAccording to the statement posted by one of the Bitcoin Core developers, this change will be made to fight the centralization of Bitcoin mining. However, AsicBoost is a patented technology available to only some users, which gives them a somewhat unfair advantage for using the “right” hardware. Given the decentralised nature of Bitcoin and mining, such an advantage should be rooted out, so it would make some sense in this regard.\n\nThen again, some ASIC manufacturers already produce far more efficient chips which are not made available to the public yet. This gives these companies an unfair advantage as well, and this has nothing to do with patented technology. Stopping such an improvement is all but impossible, which begs the question whether or not only completely open-source ASIC hardware should be allowed to mine Bitcoin.\n\nIn the end, there are advantages to the Bitcoin Core decision, and some people will disagree with removing AsicBoost as well. Bitcoin is designed to be a fair market where no one has a competitive advantage over everyone else, but enforcing that rule is a lot harder than it seems. Bitcoin mining will never be fair for everyone as this is determined by external factors beyond the control of developers.\n\nSource: Reddit\n\nHeader image courtesy of NewsBTC', ""A recent hike in prices of petroleum products in Nigeria may increase Bitcoin adoption for cross border transactions and other uses such as for safekeeping and investments.\n\nCompounded by rising foreign exchange rates for imports, the hike is likely to have a transparent effect on inflation which already hit a 46-month high of 12.8% in March.\n\nBitcoin adoption grows\n\nThere has been a growing level of Bitcoin adoption in Africa's largest economy of late though. The level of awareness about the digital currency’s uses have improved particularly for trading and online purchases.\n\nIt would seem more handy now that the disparity between the exchange rates of foreign currencies such as the US dollar to the naira has widened.\n\nThe rates charged by traditional financial institutions have not been helpful. As of Friday May 13, Western Union calculates its exchange rate for a US dollar to be 197 naira - that’s excluding the transfer charge. Whereas in the parallel market, the rate Is 345 naira.\n\nSubsidy removal stimulates the currency black market\n\nThere are speculations that the exchange rate is likely to increase soon. The government insists that the 67 percent price hike in the prices of petroleum products brought about by its sudden removal of a subsidy will not be reversed as it is aimed at tackling months of fuel shortages in the country.\n\nThe government also said petroleum product marketers who import the commodity to the country could buy dollars – which is their main currency of trade - from any source rather than just the Nigerian central bank or oil companies. This is the caveat that gets many worried.\n\nVictor Asemota, Co-Founder/Director at SwiftaCorp wrote on his twitter page: “Now that fuel marketers can get dollar from anywhere to buy product but sell in Naira, the demand for unofficial dollar is going to triple.”\n\nThe black market exchange rate fell to 341 against the dollar from 320 following the decision, Aminu Gwadabe, chairman of the Association of Bureau de Change Operators of Nigeria, told Bloomberg, on Wednesday May 11, adding that it may reach 380 next week if the central bank doesn’t increase supply in the market.\n\nThough the removal of the subsidy which led to the price hike has been described as a good step with a promise of plausible implications for the market, there are alleged plans by the government to make some adjustments to the foreign exchange management which will likely lead to the introduction of a two-way regime of a foreign exchange policy. It is not clear if the move is likely to salvage the value situation.\n\nMaintain naira value through Bitcoin\n\nTo avoid a loss of value, assets could be stored in Bitcoin, instead of the naira, for safekeeping in a Bitcoin wallet or for a rainy day. This will enable it to retain its market value until it could be used as wished. It could also be deposited in a bank such as the Bitcoin Crpto Bank or invested in peer-to-peer lending platforms like The Sun Exchange, which connects people wanting to invest in solar energy with people who want to access it. Either way, the conversion of naira into the cryptocurrency will yield a return.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin by storing it offline in cold storage could also shield its value until the market seems stronger for physical investment."", 'Bitcoin and blockchain technology, which were niche segments a couple of years ago has now become the hottest sectors in the technology industry. the number of startups and companies working in this sector has grown exponentially as well.\n\nWhile it is hard to keep track of all the companies involved in the digital currency/digital currency technology, there is a handful who have earned recognition by doing things a bit differently and 21 Inc. is one such company.\n\nWhat makes 21 Inc. different?\n\nIt is not just us who are saying 21 Inc. is different, mainly for the products they have been building and a much larger vision shared by the promoters of the company. Many other individuals, publications and business entities tend to share the same opinion about 21 Inc. as NewsBTC.\n\n21 Inc., the company founded by Balaji Srinivasan, Veerbhan Kheterpal, Daniel Firu and Nigel Drego is named after the total number of bitcoins, in millions that are ever going to be mined by the network. 21 Inc. is one of the very few companies in the world that received a nine-figure funding from some of the biggest names in the investment circles including Khosla Ventures, Winklevoss Twins, and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n21 Inc. recently launched a Bitcoin computer, the first of its kind which is small and can connect to the blockchain. The company considers bitcoin to be the fundamental system resource of the future and the CEO, Balaji Srinivasan believes that the future computers connected to the blockchain may as well start trading with other systems to create a machine economy. With the new bitcoin computer, the company has built a development device for the future, based on which the upcoming computers can be designed.\n\nIn addition to the Bitcoin computer, the company has also launched a software which is also named 21. The 21 software is compatible with Linux and Apple Mac operating systems at present. The Windows version of the software is expected to be launched soon. By using the software and the Do It Yourself instruction kit that comes along with the package can be used by enthusiasts and hardware engineers to build mining devices out of spare processors and chip platforms like Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Both of these products were announced by 21 Inc. at the recently concluded Consensus conference.\n\nWith the help of an embedded mining chip inside the Bitcoin computer, 21 Inc., has made its device mining ready. These Bitcoin computers can be classified as the prototypes of the computing devices of the future which will talk to the blockchain. Now, is such a device necessary? Do people really need it? If asked, Balaji Srinivasan has a perfect answer, which he has explained recently in one of the interviews on Yahoo Finance. By using Linux as an analogy, he says that many people using operating systems other than Linux, don’t even realize that they are using Linux every day. Every time somebody browses the internet, they are using websites that are mostly hosted on Linux platforms, the Android phones and tablets used by the majority of the mobile device users are built on a Linux kernel and so on. Similarly, bitcoin is like Linux and in the near future, everyone will be using bitcoin without even realizing it.\n\nThe products and software 21 Inc. is currently building may not make sense to many people who do not understand bitcoin, but from a bitcoin user or an enthusiast’s perspective, the company is either building the future for bitcoin or preparing the future to leverage upon the digital currency. With such a huge mission in its roadmap, the $121 million funding received by the company is justified and we can expect the company to come up with some amazing products in the near future.\n\nRef: Yahoo Finance Image: NewsBTC', 'The Bitcoin Core team is looking to refresh the process by which code changes are proposed, considered and implemented in a bid to engage more people in the development of the protocol.\n\nBut this remains a significant challenge in a diverse and distributed community.\n\nThe current process goes like this: If a community member has an idea for an update, he or she proposes it to the group by sending a description through a public mailing list. If enough people think the update is worth deploying, a Bitcoin Improvement Process (BIP) document is created and posted to the bitcoin GitHub. That document can then be commented on further by the community.\n\nOnce the document has ""rough consensus"" – defined as the general sense that everyone more or less is on board with the idea – it gets merged into the reference client, although it’s still pending review at that point.\n\n""One of the requirements for a BIP is there needs to be an implementation for it,"" said Eric Lombrozo, chief technology officer at Ciphrex and Bitcoin Core spokesperson.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Someone can’t just say I would love this new feature. They must demonstrate that it works and can be done.""\n\nDemocratizing access\n\nThis process can be rather hectic since every step is public. Plus, people are regularly introducing ideas that are at differing levels of abstraction. For instance, some proposals would require full support from the network while others aren’t mandatory. Others would require changing the code entirely.\n\nIf the proposal will change consensus rules, or how the network validates blocks on its distributed ledger, it undergoes quite a bit of review. There have been several of these soft forks, and many of them have not been particularly controversial.\n\nFor instance, BIP 65 added a new feature to the codebase which allows users to lock bitcoins up for a certain amount of time. The block size codebase change was really the first time the community was so passionately split on what should be deployed.\n\nFor these types of changes, Bitcoin Core gets the final say in what is deployed. It\'s a judgment call on the team\'s part, but Lombrozo said the group of a couple dozen Core developers wouldn\'t want to deploy a change that wouldn\'t get full support.\n\nChanges that are not as profound do not have to go through such a strict review. These application-level BIPs such as features for key storage can be implemented quicker. Lombrozo wants to speed up that process even more, letting good features develop organically based on popularity.\n\n""We want to create an informed space for people to participate in,"" said Pindar Wong, chairman of VeriFi Inc, a FinTech infrastructure consultancy and a member of the W3C’s Web Payments Community Group.\n\n""Proof of work applies to the bitcoin community at large and not just the consensus algorithm, and we need to find a way to engage these people,"" he continued.\n\nBarriers to entry\n\nBut engagement can be difficult, as it requires balancing people’s enthusiasm and experience in working on technical standards.\n\nOne thing Lombrozo thinks will help is opening up other communication channels that most people are familiar with. Currently most bitcoin technical discussions happen through Internet Relay Chat (IRC), a messaging protocol long used by developers. IRC use declined significantly after the 1990s as people moved to modern messaging and social media platforms, such as Facebook and now, Slack.\n\n""The big problem that happened earlier ... was that people didn’t know how to get to the discussions,"" Lombrozo said.\n\nLombrozo indicated that Bitcoin Core today operates on a merit system that is predominantly reputation-based, meaning those who have contributed more have more say.\n\nBut since the launch of a competing development effort, Bitcoin Classic, at the start of this year, Core has sought to open up its processes. The Bitcoin Core team has set up a Slack group, and Lombrozo hopes to find people interested in summarizing forum discussions so people that did not participate in real time can get a synopsis without all the technical minutiae.\n\nThe next step is developing a system that allows people from all different levels of interest and know-how to participate in the discussions without bogging down the development process.\n\nTo do this, Lombrozo wants to structure the process better to differentiate between different types of proposals. Currently there are three kinds of BIPs – a standards track BIP, which affects most or all bitcoin implementations; an informational BIP, which describes design issues; and a process BIP, which doesn’t affect bitcoin’s codebase but typically needs community approval still.\n\nToday, most BIP proposals come from developers and engineers. A few come from bitcoin companies that have products or services that would benefit from the addition of certain features.\n\nAccording to Lombrozo, there a couple dozen active participants in this process, although that changes over time. Overall, hundreds of people have contributed to Bitcoin Core’s nearly 145 different BIP proposals, he said.\n\nTaking inspiration\n\nYet, bitcoin is still in its infancy and developing standards on an open-source protocol without a strict process is challenging, which is why professional standards organizations like the W3C have typically dealt with this aspect of governance.\n\nNot only that, but these institutions have full-time developers on staff that are knowledgeable about the tech and the standards processes. And these groups have the support of large enterprises which send experts to work on the standards.\n\nYet the W3C’s web payments work has recently come under fire from some of its members after the large browser vendors – namely Google and Microsoft – seemed to exert undue control over the process. This made several members wonder whether they, too, could learn from bitcoin’s method of development and standardization.\n\nWong, who’s been a bitcoin enthusiast for some time, was one of those members. He believes it might be time to reinvent the standards process to make sure the Internet remains open and large enterprises don’t take over the experience for all users.\n\nSince the contention within the W3C’s web payments work, Wong has been thinking about how best to develop technology standards.\n\n""Do you need to reinvent processes or can you modify legacy processes?"" Wong asks.\n\nSometimes it’s one. Sometimes it’s the other. And sometimes, it’s a little bit of both.\n\nDeveloper Amir Taaki, a well-known yet controversial anarchist figure in the cryptocurrency space, modeled the BIP process on Python PEP-0001. And the Bitcoin Core team has been looking at other standards bodies to develop better methods on top. For instance, the next consensus rule change will make implementing BIPs and pushing those updates to miners more seamless.\n\nBut the process isn’t perfect yet. Building consensus within all bitcoin’s key groups – businesses, investors, developers, consumers – is still a struggle, one that’s particularly laborious from the engineering perspective because there isn’t a specific problem for which they’re trying to solve.\n\nWong argues that it won’t ever be. ""These aren’t static environments and so that inputs the question of adaptability,"" he said.\n\nIn defense of the ecosystem, he positioned the acrimonious climate as perhaps a sign of the community’s strength and resilience, concluding:\n\n""All this conflict, get over it.

Going through the purchase process reminded me of when I first downloaded Mosaic and surfed the net. I thought to myself, ""this is going to be a game changer"". It was.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technology will be game changers, too.\n\nBitcoin, its underlying blockchain and evolving peer-to-peer networks with Turing-complete smart contracts such as Ethereum will have a disruptive impact on many industries for years to come. Financial services, payments, supply chain logistics, insurance, and healthcare are just a few that will be disrupted with these new technologies.\n\nOut-of-hospital blockchains\n\nHealthcare will be a primary beneficiary of these new technologies, especially outside of the walls of hospitals.\n\nAs more and more health and preventive care is provisioned in virtual environments, at home, in cars, at work, etc, the need for open and accessible tracking, verifying and provisioning of care will become extremely critical for patients, payors, providers, scientists and regulators.\n\nThese new out-of-hospital (OOH) blockchains developed in the non-clinical community will set the pace for how patient behavioral and inter-clinic visit vital data is tracked in the future for provider reimbursement, regulatory compliance, safety monitoring and patient adherence.\n\nThe blockchain is a near-perfect technology (not necessarily the current implementations) to securely and safely make OOH data easily accessible with relatively minimal privacy and hack risk to all patient stakeholders, including the patient themselves, family, caregivers, clinics, providers, insurance companies and all those with a stake in their patients’ health.\n\nEach and every one of these stakeholders or network peers approved by the patient can easily join OOH blockchains as either nodes or buyer or seller of tokens or payments to gain access to patient data, utilizing a variety of open access methods and smart contracts that store and monitor real-time contractual conditions agreed to by and between various stakeholders.\n\nThere will be many OOH blockchains developed to address the myriad of use cases in healthcare, including tracking the development of drugs, doctor and nurses credentialing, real-time population health data analysis and alerts, insurance peer-to-peer risk pooling, telemedicine and home health visit data sharing, decentralized autonomous organizations, verification and audits, and remote device monitoring commonly addressed today under the Internet of Things category.\n\nThese open and viable peer-to-peer healthcare blockchains will open the door to new business models in healthcare, including analytics-for-healthcare products and services, flash malpractice insurance and friction-less claims processing hence shorter revenue cycles.\n\nHealthcare insurance claims processing\n\nIt is no secret that healthcare claims processing is a nightmare for all parties involved. Reimbursement is opaque, fraud is prevalent, and transactions frequently difficult to reconcile.\n\nFor example, home health, a great OOH blockchain example, is possibly one of the greatest sources of fraud in the US healthcare industry today. Smart contracts powered by a blockchain could provide consumers and payors with the means to manage claims in a transparent, immutable and responsive fashion.\n\nInsurance contracts, premium payments and their respective claims could be recorded onto a blockchain and validated by node consensus, preventing fraudulent claims from being processed. Smart contracts could enforce claims triggering payments when due or dispatching specialists, nurses or doctors to follow up with patients when anticipated claims are not recorded by presumptive dates.\n\nManaging ""super-utilizers""\n\nThe term super-utilizer describes individuals whose complex physical, behavioral and social needs are not well met through the current fragmented health care system.\n\nThese individuals go from emergency room to emergency room, to admission and re-admission, in a chaotic and costly manner. Mental health, substance abuse, poverty and education are frequently cited as common characteristics of many but not all in this group. Many researchers and experts postulate how more ""community support"" and ""real-time engagement"" is needed to manage this socially isolated population of healthcare super-utilizing consumers.\n\nSmart contracts powered by an OOH blockchain utilizing the bitcoin payment system could be used to create a rewards and incentive system to manage super utilizer behavior.\n\nBehavioral contracts could be developed between payor and patient to trigger rewards denominated in BTC for attending support groups, regularly engaging a telehealth professional, reporting health conditions (possibly at kiosks with bitcoin point-of-care devices), and meeting agreed upon health goals.\n\nPayors would fund reward payouts via efficient BTC accounts established at commercial digital currency exchanges. A smart contract would trigger a reward payment (or loss) when goals are met near real-time to the patient’s public bitcoin address which in turn could be tendered at local participating outlets equipped with BTC point-of-contact devices including community centers, supermarkets and apartment complexes to pay bills, purchase healthy foods and meet rent obligations.\n\nMedical malpractice insurance DAOs\n\nIn theory, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are entities that are self-governing. DAOs on a OOH blockchain could enable trust and provide an immutable record and audit trail of an agreement without a single controlling body.\n\nDoctors and nurse practitioners could collaborate to establish a peer-to-peer malpractice DAO and record each peer\'s premium payments and claims on the blockchain. All premiums paid in would create a pool of capital to pay claims.\n\nBy combining the blockchain with the peer-to-peer business model, this creates the potential for a near-autonomous self-regulated insurance business model for managing policy and claims. No single entity would control the network. Policyholders could ""equally"" control the network on a pro-rata basis.\n\nBut, these are just a few examples of how bitcoin and blockchain technology will change the face of healthcare in the future.\n\nThe blockchain is a new and exciting technology, and we are now just beginning to see both small and large players dip their toes into the water. I personally would discourage any entrepreneur from pursuing the use of blockchain technology inside the walls of clinics and hospitals today, as the those lanes are laden with painful obstacles – the OOH blockchain is your winning lane today.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LinkedIn and has been republished with the author\'s permission.\n\nFuture doctor image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

It also raised significant issues around centralization and bitcoin’s somewhat awkward relationship with the mostly China-based mining industry.\n\nIn this post, I will attempt to document different parts of the debate as it played out from different perspectives. I do not consider myself beholden to any specific strand and have attempted to be as neutral as is feasible. Corrections are always welcome.\n\nThe debate concerned a central technical issue that also had significant implications for how bitcoin is governed. For the Bitcoin Classic team, this meant, in essence, finding a solution that solved the filling of blocks due to high transaction volumes while also finding a way to move governance away from the Bitcoin Core development team and toward the mining community.\n\nOne of the first attempts to address this problem came from Mike Hearn, at the time a Bitcoin Core developer, in the form of BIP 64. BIP 64 was announced in June 2014, but the client Bitcoin XT (the ""precursor"" to Classic) emerged in December 2014.\n\nBitcoin XT never took off, but it indicated Hearn\'s early belief in the necessity of a new approach to the scaling problem. However, there was support for XT from one notable group of the bitcoin network: namely the payment and wallet communities.\n\nThis is likely because the smaller the blocks, the more users have to pay in transactions fees and the slower the network becomes. Since these services are oriented toward people who want to make speedy transactions an expensive and slow network has negative effects on wider adoption.\n\nHard fork issue emerges\n\nIn June 2015, then chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation Gavin Andresen announced BIP 101. BIP 101 was rolled out in XT in August 2015, but it never really gained traction among the mining community.\n\nHowever, the fact that such notable bitcoin developers were actively seeking to introduce a hard fork started a fierce debate over not just this technical issue, but also how changes in bitcoin should occur going into the future.\n\nSince Bitcoin XT was not gaining support, a less drastic proposal to raise the block size was put forward through a hard fork that would increase the limit to 2 megabytes. Known as Bitcoin Classic, this fork was developed by crucial players in the wider bitcoin community, specifically Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik (founder of Bloq). The other developers were Pedro Pinheiro (Blockchain), Tom Zander and Jon Rumion.\n\nThere are discrepancies between the original release and Classic’s website on this front. On the site Peter Rizun is listed as a developer, but on the release as an external advisor. However, it is the names that appear on the release and not on the site that are most interesting for understanding the backstory of Classic.\n\nThe Classic release states that mining will come under Marshall Long, current CTO of cloud-mining service FinalHash. There is not much information beyond his name on the release as to his role with Classic (though he is well-connected enough to have attended the Satoshi Roundtable). Another interesting name is Jonathon Toomim, listed as an external advisor, who worked on Classic quite a lot before handing the reigns over to Andresen (who seems to have not wanted to develop it at first according to Guy Corem here).\n\nFinally, Olivier Janssens is listed as a facilitator on the release (and a ""user"" on the Classic site). Janssens is a pretty influential player since he, along with Long, secured Toomim as the original developer for Classic. Janssens’ presence is important because, during his term as a board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, he leaked damaging details about the incompetent way it was run.\n\nIn many ways, then, Classic can be seen as an attempt to challenge the governance structure of the Bitcoin Foundation, currently not involved in development, but also, more importantly, the Bitcoin Core development team as such.\n\nThe two motivations for Classic can broadly be seen in Garzik’s BIP 100, which essentially would see the miners decide on the appropriate block size and his compromise BIP 102, which would have increased the block size to 2MB as a compromise to ensure blocks did not become too full (aimed at solving the problem of slow and expensive transactions in the immediate term).\n\nHow this played out will go down in bitcoin folklore for sparking one of the most contentious, but also fascinating, debates about what bitcoin should be and next time we will turn to how the miners reacted to the introduction of Classic into the ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin Core\n\nIn this section, I need to do some legwork regarding the Bitcoin Core development team and their development process.\n\nThis is required because bitcoin is unusual in organisational terms because it is, by design, a nominally decentralised network (with no leader or an ""absent"" one). Nonetheless, there are quasi-hierarchies operative. Chiefly between the developers and the mostly Chinese miners. How is consensus arrived at? The question is immensely complex when we are referring to the wider bitcoin ecosystem, but the straight-up development process is much more direct.\n\nBitcoin development is open to any developer interested in the project.\n\nMost of its activity occurs at the Bitcoin GitHub repository. The software that is developed is known as Bitcoin Core; and it is open-source. It is important to note that although this is the dominant venue, discussion also occurs on a mailing list known as bitcoin-dev. There is also an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel that is more informal and that is logged (irc.freenode.net #bitcoin-dev).\n\nGenerally, the process involves users suggesting ""pull requests"" that are akin to suggestions that have been put up for review by other developers. Their purpose is to patch or improve the codebase.\n\nIt’s not uncommon to see some proposals, suggestions or debates turn up in the bitcoin reddit communities or dedicated bitcoin forums.\n\nHow Core works\n\nA large number of the Bitcoin Core developers listed have contributed once to the repository.\n\nAnother subset have contributed between two and 10 times. From there, the numbers thin out until we arrive at what can be termed the core, in the normal sense, development team who exist because ‘some hierarchy is necessary for practical purposes.\n\nAs such there are repository ""maintainers"" who are responsible for merging pull requests as well as a ""lead maintainer"" who is responsible for the release cycle, overall merging, moderation and appointment of maintainers.\n\nIn other words, there is no official Core developer team, but there are maintainers and a lead maintainer. It is these individuals who have the final say on whether a patch becomes a part of Bitcoin Core. If the patch fixes a relatively minor issue, the process follows the broad criteria that ‘a patch is in line with the general principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will judge the general consensus of contributors.’\n\nFor the academically inclined this process is akin to peer-review, but less formalised.\n\nMore interesting is when the patch relates to consensus rules since these are fundamental to the nature of bitcoin.\n\nThey require a far more rigorous process and such suggestions will tend to be listened to only when they come from lead developers. The scaling debate is one area where this became quite clear to even those looking at bitcoin from outside.\n\nIt is important to make a quick distinction here.\n\nIt is possible in bitcoin to implement a “soft fork” that might, for instance, improve or fix a relatively minor issue. Users will not be required to update their software, but would be encouraged to do so. With a hard fork, everyone needs to upgrade to the new implementation. Since a hard fork “breaks” or discards an old rule essential to the current protocol, it is possible for two distinct blockchains to emerge with rules that are in contradiction to one another.\n\nHard forks are, then, unsurprisingly contentious since they introduce the possibility of a split. That technical split can always lead to the possibility of a community split.\n\nMinor notes\n\nA few other small notes are worth mentioning: many people may have come believe BIPs (Bitcoin Implementation Proposals) refer to some kind of platform for suggestions that require a hard fork.\n\nThis is very much an effect of the scaling debate where competing BIPs were, in fact, often being produced as simply competing ideas for how best to scale (or not). Indeed, some BIPs simply provide information. Many BIPs have been applied, but many have not. Some have been withdrawn and some are in stasis.\n\nThey are complicated, but in the scaling debate they did emerge as a clear means for competing visions of how to proceed with bitcoin in general.\n\nNow it is important to remember that sometimes developers become dormant or are presumed to be completely inactive. For instance, the inventor of the BIP system, Amir Taaki, was once highly visible in the world of bitcoin, but has ceased to actively engage in it.\n\nThere are also, I must stress, a huge number of people I will be overlooking in what follows and they include very important (albeit less vocal) contributors to Bitcoin Core. Some developers are simply quiet and plug away in the background.\n\nFor those who have no discernible stake in the public debates, I have left them aside.\n\nThe Core team\n\nNow, technically those who worked on Classic never stopped working on Core per se.\n\nFor example Gavin Andresen (BIP 101) has always been seen as central to Core. He was also famously the Chief Scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation (paid) and now is funded by the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative. Jeff Garzik (BIP 100/102) will always be an important figure. Mike Hearn is no longer engaged with bitcoin at all and has moved to R3CEV.\n\nIt is, of course, Hearn\'s dramatic exit from bitcoin that really heated things up with the scaling debate.\n\nNow, alongside Andresen at the MIT Media Lab initiative we find Cory Fields who has never been too vocal. Then we have Wladimir J van der Laan with the MIT initiative as well (both were also funded by the Bitcoin Foundation).\n\nVan der Laan is also the lead maintainer and often appears to be the more senior of the other two maintainers, namely Jonas Schnelli and Marco Falke. Neither of these played an especially vocal role in the scaling debate, although Schnelli is a far more visible figure. Those who are not maintainers, but did have more to say about the scaling debate include Eric Lombrozo, CEO of Ciphrex.\n\nThere are a few more members of Bitcoin Core we need to focus on.\n\nFirst let me focus on the relationship of Core to Blockstream (founded, 2015).\n\nBlockstream is a distinct entity from Core in as much as it is a funded venture (see here and here). Core developers such as Jorge Timón and Matt Corallo are amongst a concentration of Core developers under the Blockstream banner. In other words, it’s really Blockstream that funds the highest number of Core developers.\n\nTherefore it’s essential to understand what Blockstream is actually attempting to do. We’ve not yet covered everybody we want to at Core, but first we need to take a quick diversion.\n\nBlockstream is oriented toward the development of sidechains and was originally announced by hashcash inventor Adam Back and Austin Hill (neither of whom are Core developers). Sidechains are useful for a number of reasons, but not least that they offer a way to innovate without introducing a hard fork.\n\nSuch an alteration in the consensus rules takes time. For those committed to the decentralist perspective, and for whom technical shifts in Bitcoin ought to be handled with extreme care sidechains offer a solution. To be precise, we are discussing pegged sidechains which are, more or less, custom blockchains to the “side” of the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn many ways, a company like Coinbase is basically a quasi-sidechain. When you send bitcoins there they are going off the usual peer-to-peer grid. Coinbase will likely have a pool of bitcoins, a reserve (liquidity) and what you move out might not be the same coins. So it acts as a quasi-sidechain in as much as it unsettles the usual ethos of Bitcoin where each person is demonstrating they own the private key to spend some coins.\n\nBut the bonus is that you can do things pretty fast with Coinbase. And, of course, this was a crucial argument made during the scaling debate: namely that we should focus on improving transaction speed along these lines as the most important concern for a digital currency.\n\nOverall, sidechains basically follow the “sandboxed” model. By isolating the sidechain from the main chain – while allowing for transferability of the asset – it becomes possible to take more risks. You don’t want to set out to break your sidechain, but you won’t lose everything if you do.\n\nIt works in much the same way that sandboxing your browser means a browser bug won’t end destroying your entire operating system. Furthermore, your bitcoins are never at risk since they are merely acting as tokens on or for the sidechain. Pretty quickly, perhaps due to a lack of adoption, Sidechain Elements was announced.\n\nElements was more functional, making life easier for adopters, but it contained a subtle feature known as Segregated Witness. Segwit was the idea of Gregory Maxwell, Core developer, and also a member of Blockstream. The original outline of segwit would require a hard fork, but, fortunately, Luke Dashjr came to the rescue (details here) with a method that would allow it to be a soft fork.\n\nSegwit was, after Maxwell’s conceptualisation and Dashjr’s fix, coded by the final member we should name, the brilliant coder Dr Pieter Wiuelle (of Blockstream) – with input, as with most bitcoin endeavours from fellow developers.\n\nSegwit is now moving forward, though an exact timeline for its release has not been indicated.\n\nThis is post is part one and two of a series by Dr Ennis, republished here with his permission.

After publicly coming out and presenting evidence to the media, this was quickly dismissed as dubiously insufficient proof. Wright then promised to provide irrefutable proof by moving some of the first Bitcoin ever mined, which was met with much doubt and derision. Finally, he bailed on his promise to provide the undeniable proof, disappearing into the night with a vague and cryptic apology.\n\nWhere does that leave us? Craig Wright is very likely not Satoshi Nakamoto. But that doesn’t mean he wasn’t right to disappear as he did, and it certainly doesn’t mean we have nothing learn from his untimely departure from the limelight. Here’s why the real Satoshi Nakamoto should absolutely stay out of public.\n\nThe resulting media circus\n\nWright’s announcement was followed by a veritable torrent of publicity, as was surely his original goal. With it came intense scrutiny as writers and pundits the world over speculated, gossipped, and attempted to disprove the claim. Any further attempt by anyone else to claim the mantle of the legendary Nakamoto will be sure to trigger a similar media circus, forever shattering any hope of privacy.\n\nInstant vilification\n\nThe aftermath of Wright’s announcement produced a significant dose of vitriol from the cryptocurrency community. While his promises to definitely prove his secret identity by moving Bitcoin from some of the first blocks were still pending, Wright was assailed with accusations of being a liar, a fraud, and a con-man. While these condemnations ultimately found themselves on the side of reason, they were nonetheless both plentiful and harsh. Bitcoin Core developer Wladimir van der Laan wrote a blog post condemning the “atmospheric toxicity” of the cryptocurrency community, while Gavin Andresen (who had himself been convinced by Wright’s claims) urged an end to “making tempests out of teapots.” Andreas Antonopoulos neatly summed up that sentiment:\n\n“Stop bashing each other, we have a financial revolution to deliver to the world.”\n\nTrouble from the government\n\nWorst of all, going public as a creator of the world’s premier cryptocurrency, something governments have by and large regarded with suspicion, can lead to some unpleasant interactions with authorities. Arthur Budovsky, the creator of Liberty Reserve, considered by some to be Bitcoin’s predecessor, received a 20-year prison sentence for money laundering because of his work in digital currency. Seeing how Craig Wright’s home was raided by officials last year around the time the first round of Satoshi suspicions around him became public, one can easily see how coming out as Bitcoin’s creator could come with some serious legal implications. Justly or not, Satoshi can easily be a wanted man.\n\nThe real Satoshi Nakamoto is out there somewhere, whether he is an individual, a collective, or a mere concept. Whatever the reality, though, Craig Wright’s stunt revealed exactly what happens when someone comes out as the legendary founder of a cryptocurrency: instant celebrity gossip cycle, quick derision and ugliness, and legal trouble in short order. The message to Satoshi is clear: stay hidden as long as you can.', 'While Danish crypto currency exchange CCEDK has signalled that it is to become a hub for a series of “diverse projects” and services, with the current trading engine ceasing for good this May, investors should not panic as the shutdown will allow the exchange to initiate a major upgrade. Once revamped it relaunches as a Decentralized Conglomerate on 1 July - aka an enterprise ecosystem engine.\n\nBut you might ask what does this overhaul involve exactly? Well, CCEDK (now named Crypto Coins Enterprise Denmark) will transition from operating as an exchange to becoming the service and education center for the OpenLedger platform, which will effectively serve as a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on assets, smart coins and smarts contracts.\n\nCrowdfunded Projects\n\nThe pioneers behind this latest move explain that it will include helping start-ups and businesses create digital tokens to crowd-fund new projects and simultaneously assist in what is described as assisting “digital currency cross the mass adoption” threshold.\n\nAs the crowd-funding process is discriminatory - not only due to selection from a vetting perspective - but also due to market demand, the team behind CCEDK’s new endeavour indicates that it will only be focusing on two crowd-funding campaigns per month.\n\nThe DAO Hub\n\nOne might think that all this talk about crowd funding in the cryto currency arena is mumbo jumbo. Well, think again and reflect on the fact that The DAO had raised an equivalent of over US$106 million (m) to date in a crowdsale of their token in the past two weeks and smashed it. This figure is based on 10.53m Ethereum (ETH) at an indicative price of $10.12 per ETH unit (0.02215930 Bitcoin (BTC) equivalent) at the end of this past week.\n\nHowever, with twelve days still remaining until May 28 (09:00 GMT) in the project’s fund raising, one wonders just how much more this figure will swell to. Thus far a not inconsiderable 1,052.5m DAO tokens have been created. And, when The DAO receives ETH, new DAO tokens are created at that moment.\n\nExchange Upgrade\n\nA white paper to describe the organizational structure and operation flow behind CCDEK’s overhaul is currently in the process of being prepared by Larry Christopher Bates, Bitland Global’s chief security officer based in Indiana, who has Master’s degrees in cyber security and telecommunications.\n\nIt is understood that Bates, who has also written about the theoretical application of the blockchain on the global economy, will present a “theoretical construct” for a new model of economic ecosystem that is built on OpenLedger and guided by CCEDK.\n\nWithdrawals from CCDEK will nevertheless unaffected during the upgrade period and possible throughout June 2016 upon request - as well as afterwards.\n\nThereafter, on 1 July 2016 when the exchange re-opens, CCEDK will serve as a portal for OpenLedger and as what is being described as “an investment knowledge hub” for the so-called Decentralized Conglomerate, which currently includes OpenLedger, Obits, blockchain-advertisting network BitTeaser plus other blockchain-based projects.\n\nThe Decentralized Conglomerate\n\nIt was back in March 2016 on Forbes that I explored themes around bitcoin, the blockchain and the future of newly coined term the Decentralized Conglomerate (DC). The latter is effectively a new form of partnership and touted as the “cutting-edge” method to building communities and establishing diversity in the marketplace.\n\nThe DC development is basically an idea that has existed as far back as last October when BitShares launched on OpenLedger, a universal shared platform based on the BitShares 2.0 MIT-licensed Graphene blockchain technology. The term itself was incidentally conceived by Bates.\n\nA Decentralized Conglomerate enables multiple organizations to team up and join forces on a universal platform and allows them to invest in each other’s success. In theory it should result in the entire network reaping the benefits of cross-promotion. At least that is the theoretical goal.\n\nOpenLedger’s Role\n\nAs part of its evolution, CCEDK will transition from hosting an exchange to operating as support for the OpenLedger project. In so doing the pioneers forging this vision assert that it will not only become a service center but a “fiat gateway for the platform.”\n\nRonny Boesing, CEO and founder CCEDK, explaining some of the benefits says: “This will consolidate volumes between the two exchanges and give CCEDK a new position as the entry point for start-ups or businesses looking to raise funds, thus offering vital knowledge and experience, and enabling developers to serve end users better.”\n\nSupporting Enterprise\n\nSpecifically, the relaunched CCEDK aims to have an emphasis on crowd funding and supporting new blockchain-based enterprises, with new services including escrow facilities, crowd funding, marketing and even issuance of assets on behalf of existing businesses looking to create their own smart currency.\n\nBoesing adds: “We plan to use our expertise to facilitate new businesses raising money and getting up and running, as well as being the fiat gateway for OpenLedger, which similarly allows us to offer vital knowledge and feedback, enabling developers to better serve end users.”\n\nHe stresses that crowd-funding is the way to get to the heart of what the market desires. “Giving the crowd a direct involvement in bringing projects to fruition is a great way to let the market decide what it wants and needs,” he argues.\n\nAs part of this programme, CCEDK will sell so-called Initial Coin Offering (ICO) packages to businesses seeking to raise funds, also generating revenues for OpenLedger and CCEDK.\n\nThe Dane up in Jutland reveals that “tiered packages will come with different levels of advertising and blogging support, plus the creation of a custom token.” Higher-tier packages will offer more articles, written about the company from the Obits Bloggers’ Club 500 as well as a number of BitTeaser advertisements.\n\nICCO (Initial Coin Offering Openledger)\n\nA proportion of the revenues from consulting and selling ICO packages will then flow into OBITS and BitTeaser - as supporting assets - whilst another allocation will be made to holders of a new asset, Initial Coin Offering Openledger or ICOO for short.\n\nLaunching later this month on 20 May, ICOO is held up as a new kind of fund that will invest in future ICOs and create “proxy tokens” for them. These which allow users to trade the new project on OpenLedger in the period before the official launch.\n\nAs with other new projects, it is understood that a proportion of ICOO assets are reserved for OBITS, which Boesing describes as a “catch-all asset” representing all current and future initiatives in the CCEDK network.\n\nICOO funds will be distributed across several other key projects too beside from team funding. That will encompass: (1) BitTeaser advertising network; (2) Obits-based blogging network; (3) the DGX gold asset; (4) the Cadastral land contract asset; and, (5) A reserve buffer and implementation budget. Sounds like they are riding many horses on the way to the ultimate objective.\n\nFrom an IT and technical perspective, the backend developers and assigned contractor of the ‘open’ assets of OpenLedger - namely blocktrades.us - will undertake the implementation of the various crypto currencies added to the OpenLedger platform, while the CCEDK team will handle everything else besides.\n\nDAOHub: CCEDK’s First ‘ICOO’ Project\n\nAs CCEDK is preparing to launch ICOO, the first project that will be a focus of the token’s energy will be DAOHub. The way this will work out is that CCEDK will take a portion of the ICOO crowd funding campaign and purchase DAOHub tokens.\n\nSubsequently after completion of the DAO ICO, the ICOO community will then move to support the next ICO that the CCEDK specialists “scout out and report” as being potentially prolific projects according to Bitland’s Bates.\n\nBoesing and his team’s quest and the long-term goals for Openledger and CCEDK are to be an “incubator for tech start-ups”, a hub for existing businesses to transition to blockchain-based infrastructure as well as a “portal for investors to find these businesses.”\n\nIt’s a bold vision and one where the Dane intends for the synergy between the platforms to help them become the crowd-funding platform of the future. Let’s hope he’s right in being able to bring the dreams of the market to reality. Soyez chanceux.', 'The Banks don’t want to acknowledge the existence of bitcoin, but they are all eagerly waiting in a line to implement the Bitcoin technology. Do the banks realize that there would have been no blockchain without the bitcoin? The endless opportunities these banks are seeing, where they can potentially save millions of dollars every year by using a much faster, economical and secure alternative to existing infrastructure is being made possible by the very digital currencies they are trying to ignore.\n\nThe growth of Bitcoin as an alternative currency has been a very uncomfortable development for the mainstream banking and financial sector. Even though the use of bitcoin is still limited, mainly due to slow adoption rate, its advantages against the present monetary system is well known among the people. It has been ages since a disruptive technology made inroads to the well-established financial system, which has so far been ruled by banks. They have been acting as the gatekeepers of the financial system, sometimes making decisions for the individuals about how they should save or spend the money.\n\nEnter bitcoin and people now have an option which they never believed could exist. The democratization of the economy, where the individuals have the freedom to decide how and what they want to do with their money without having to rely upon or go through the institutionalized monetary channels. Since bitcoin became popular, it has undermined the authority of banks and financial institutions on the financial system. People no longer have to rely upon the bankers who have been handling their money for generations to make a transaction. They can do it by themselves. If someone wants to send funds to a relative or a friend staying abroad, they no longer have to go to the bank, fill up forms stating reasons for carrying out an outward remittance and wait for few days till the funds are received by the other party, minus the hefty transaction fee. Instead, they can just initiate a bitcoin transaction for the required amount to the bitcoin wallet address belonging to the recipient and viola, the person will receive the funds in less than an hour.\n\nThe decentralized nature of bitcoin prevents any government and financial institution from acting as a trusted third party to facilitate transactions, instead, people who are part of the network themselves act as trusted third party. By the process of elimination of centralized organizations from interfering with the ecosystem, bitcoin is creating a free market. These free markets, which existed only on the deep web in the recent past is now accessible to everyone. Platforms like Open Bazaar are the earliest forms of online free markets currently out there, where the buyers and sellers have the freedom to decide the price of a commodity instead of some institution dictating terms. In the emerging free market model, the prices of goods and services will be based on the actual supply and demand instead of an arbitrary number set by someone from somewhere who may not even use the product.\n\nThe banking sector has been relying on a fixed structure of monetary policies devised to ensure their profits for too long, and now the realization has drawn upon them that their existing model may not stay profitable anymore. There are only two ways to overcome it, either by embracing the digital currency or by shutting it down. Embracing bitcoin will not make much sense to them as they may not see much profits in it and also there is no place for banks in a decentralized monetary system. Left with the second option, the banks are now trying had to discredit the digital currency while implementing the blockchain technology into their operations to improve their infrastructure. However, the main motive behind that is not to make banking more customer friendly, but to reduce the operational costs in order to make more profits.\n\nUnder the traditional monetary system, the banking sector has significant control over a country’s economy, which has led to the development of a symbiotic relationship between banks and the government. banks have no qualms about exploiting this relationship to lobby against the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies, with an intention of influencing regulators to crack down on such businesses and users who are involved in using and trading digital currencies. This poses a significant threat to the digital currency ecosystem, at this stage as it is still in the process of gaining mass adoption. Until people make a complete transition from fiat currency to the digital currency ecosystem, there may be a need to work directly or indirectly with the existing system, and the banking sector is trying to target that by declining their services to companies operating bitcoin exchanges and other digital currency based services.\n\nThe actions on the mainstream banking and financial institutions’ part have made it obvious that they are threatened by the development in the bitcoin sector and they are trying to prevent its growth by throwing roadblocks at it.\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC Header Image via: NewsBTC', 'Peter Todd, backed by Matt Corallo, has proposed hard-fork changes to the bitcoin network to make “useless” patent pending algorithmic improvements which give mining an Asicboost of 20%, leading to increased profits of some $30 million if used by one of the biggest mining pools.\n\nIn a striking post to the bitcoin mailing list, Todd states:\n\n“As part of the hard-fork proposed in the HK agreement we’d like to make the patented AsicBoost optimisation useless, and hopefully make further similar optimizations useless as well.”\n\nArguing that the patent pending optimization may lead to mining centralization as the license could be limited to only one manufacturer or lead Chinese manufacturers to ignore the patent, but restrict export of the optimized ASICs to USA, Todd stated that if any other patented mining optimizations are found “we’d definitely consider fighting them as well.”\n\nCorallo, after making a suggestion on how Asicboost’s optimizations could be made irrelevant, states:\n\n“While this is somewhat nasty, the risks of AsicBoost and the precedent that should be set necessitates a response, and it should be included in any hardfork.”\n\nGregory Maxwell, stating that he was not sure whether forking the optimization is the best move at this point, but was happy some were carefully thinking doing just that, argued:\n\n“A 20% inherent advantage, in perfect competition, is likely to lead to an eventual monopoly of mining if monopoly patent right prohibit competitions– if mining profits go are under the level of that enhancement everyone without it would be operating at a loss.”\n\nSergio Demian Lerner, a renown bitcoin security expert who collaborated with Timo Hanke in creating Asicboost, argued that changing the protocol would send a strong message to the ecosystem that any ASIC optimization should be kept secret and further stated that if the patent license is non-exclusive then all can use the optimization.\n\nTimo Hanke stated that there was no way to know who was currently using the optimization as manufacturers do not reveal such information. Therefore, the proposed hardfork guarantees “two co-existing bitcoin blockchains” as current asicboost hardware would have no choice, but to continue mining on the current chain as they cannot switch over to the majority chain.\n\nThe above proposal has caused some controversy for indicating a central planner mind-set as well as a seemingly openness to hardforking after a year of vigorously arguing against it, with Oliver Janssens, an early bitcoin adopter, tweeting:\n\nNote to miners: We, the core devs, discovered a patented optimization in your ASIC. We will make it obsolete in the next update. Thank you. — Olivier Janssens (@olivierjanss) May 13, 2016\n\nThe proposal is made in the context of a hard fork promised by many bitcoin developers in the Hong Kong Agreement. According to that “consensus” agreement, segwit was to be released last month, but even now in mid-May it still has not been merged. A hardfork proposal was to be made three months after, that is by July.\n\nSome suggest that the Asicboost proposal is an attempt to make the hardfork as controversial as possible or boggle it down into numerous other changes to the protocol, including changes contained in the hardfork wishlist, which will necessarily take much time and effort, thus most probably have it delayed or shelved. Rather than focus on only a maxblocksize increase as Gavin Andresen suggested in summer 2015 to avoid a never ending debate on what should or should not be included in the hardfork.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Having almost tripled since last summer, Bitcoin transaction fees continue to grow. According to a new bitcoin fee estimator from Bitmain, almost 20,000 transactions are currently paying more than 35 cents for a next block confirmation. The current average fee is almost 15 cents per average bitcoin transaction size of approximately 500 bytes.\n\nThe somewhat confusing graph, due to unintuitive parameters such as satoshi per byte, illustrates no transaction is currently delayed at a fee rate of more than 60 satoshis per byte, which has to be multiplied by the average transaction size of 500 bytes, divided by 100 million satoshis into a bitcoin and the resulting fee of 0.0003 converted to usd, which, at the current price, according to google, stands at 15 cents.\n\nOpting for a higher fee\n\nFew are likely to go through the laborious process of undertaking the above calculations every time they wish to make a transaction. Many, therefore, are opting in for a much higher fee of 150 satoshis per byte or 35 cents per average transaction. Moreover, exchanges may incur production costs when changing or calculating default fees. Leading some service providers to set a higher fee rate, such as okcoin’s current 0.0005 btc per transaction, or 23 cents.\n\nTransactions even more expensive\n\nBitcoin transaction fees have almost tripled since last summer due to a cap on transaction capacity, pricing out some businesses. The latest example is Ascribe, an intellectual property attribution company which intended to use bitcoin’s blockchain for property attribution. However, Trent McConaghy, CEO of Ascribe stated that they had to design their own blockchain, called BigchainDB, which was released back in February, due to bitcoin’s scalability making transactions expensive.\n\nAccording to McConaghy, one potential customer needed to make 100,000 transactions a day, costing $10,000 per day at a fee of 10 cents. He further states:\n\n“We found ourselves needing to turn down opportunities knowing that the Bitcoin blockchain would [not] be able to handle the throughput we needed to serve larger enterprises.”\n\nThere has been a long debate on Bitcoin’s scalability with many hoping that by now the matter would be settled, but the absence of a segwit release has led to the issue being re-visited, with Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain/Antpool, tweeting on the 29th of April:\n\n“Someone must be… enjoying the tx fee policy maker position.”\n\nFollowed by a further tweet complaining that: “A new Bitcoin user was confused by the slow Bitcoin network and the fee policy. (From a wechat group).”\n\nPeter Smith, CEO of Blockchain.info, complained back in March that one of the most popular bitcoin wallets was facing record numbers of complaints regarding transaction delays. Little action seems to be taken, with a solution, as yet, not available.\n\nFees, therefore, may continue to increase, pricing out further businesses and opportunities as well as fuelling the current blockchain hype as service providers are forced to build their own private blockchains.', 'For several years now, there seem to be a lot of myths surrounding Bitcoin which need to be clarified and rectified. Several of these topics keep returning on a regular basis, showing an apparent lack of education as far as mainstream media is concerned. It is not all that hard to get some basic facts about Bitcoin right in the first place.\n\nDebunking Common Bitcoin Myths\n\nOne of the most often heard comments is how Bitcoin has a CEO or leader, which is not true. Bitcoin has a creator, who goes by the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym, but never revealed his, her, or their original identity. Nor is there a need to do so, at Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are not about the people behind the code, but only the code itself. This also means there is no such thing as “arresting the Bitcoin CEO” or anything along those lines, a headline which seems to pop up now and then.\n\nThe second most common statement is how Bitcoin is volatile because it has no official backing. This is quite a contradictory statement, as something which is not backed has no intrinsic value, and can therefore not be volatile. However, Bitcoin does not need backing in the traditional sense, as the cryptocurrency is backed by confidence. Moreover, the volatility of Bitcoin does not make the currency useless by any means, as any currency in the world is subject to volatility on a daily basis.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the only contradictory Bitcoin statement the media has ever made. They also claim Bitcoin is both anonymous and completely transparent at the same time, yet neither of those sayings is entirely correct. Bitcoin is far from anonymous, as there is only a slight level of pseudonymity associated with this alternative form of finance. Additionally, all transactions are recorded on the blockchain in real-time, publicly visible to anyone in the world.\n\nHowever, this does not mean Bitcoin becomes completely transparent all of a sudden. These types of myths need to be nipped in the bud, as pseudonymity does not allow for complete transparency. Traits which are mutually exclusive do not compute, and one would expect mainstream media to get that part right, at least. There is no need for mainstream media to create additional myths about Bitcoin, especially when they can be debunked so easily.\n\nLast but not least, there is the ‘holy trinity” of Bitcoin myths which need to be addressed. Bitcoin is not only used for illegal purposes, although it is rather easy to slap that sticker on a concept people don’t seem [willing] to grasp completely. Nor is cryptocurrency used by terrorists, despite some internet criminals taking a liking to Bitcoin. The privacy issues associated with Bitcoin make it unsuitable for any illegal purpose in general.\n\nThe third party in this holy trinity is how Bitcoin is dead. Or to be more precise, Bitcoin has died so many times; most people gave up the count quite some time ago. This field of technology goes through certain issues that need to be addressed, but so does any other innovative concept. Right now, Bitcoin is at its peak of performance, and there is no reason why this trend won’t continue for quite some time to come.\n\nSource: Nasdaq\n\nHeader image courtesy of NewsBTC', 'Ransomware can ruin your computer and all of your files.\n\nYou’re sitting at your computer when you get an email from your local bank saying you were just hit with a charge for a new $1,200 MacBook that you never bought. You click the email and follow the embedded link or download the included receipt to find out what’s up.\n\nJust like that, your computer has been infected with ransomware. You can’t access your files, and all you can see is a timer counting down the time until hackers delete your computer’s drive unless you pay them a fee in iTunes gift cards.\n\nAll you can do is scratch your head and wonder what the hell just happened. Well, I’m here to explain that to you — and to help you fight back against ransomware criminals.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is this: Never, ever pay the ransom.\n\nRansom?\n\nLet’s start with the basics. A particularly nefarious form of malware, ransomware is a piece of software criminals use to lock you out of your computer by encrypting its files and holding them for ransom for a specific dollar amount.\n\nIf you don’t pay up, you can potentially say goodbye to your photos, tax documents, pay stubs, and any other documents you’ve saved throughout the years.\n\nThis isn’t some idle threat, either. If you don’t pay, your documents will disappear or simply stay locked up until you completely reformat your system.\n\nRansomware programs sometimes require you to pay in Bitcoin, an anonymous currency that can’t be tracked.\n\nHowever, criminals have increasingly begun demanding payment in the form of iTunes or Amazon gift cards, since the average person doesn’t know how to use Bitcoin, according to Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security.\n\nThe amount you have to pay to unlock your computer can vary, with some experts saying criminals will ask for up to $500.\n\nTo be clear, ransomware doesn’t just target Windows PCs. The malware has been known to impact systems ranging from Android phones and tablets to Linux-based computers and Macs.\n\nWhere it comes from\n\nAccording to Davis, ransomware was actually popular among cybercriminals over a decade ago. But it was far easier to catch the perpetrators back then since anonymous currency like Bitcoin didn’t exist yet. Bitcoin helped changed all that by making it nearly impossible to track criminals based on how victims pay them.\n\nRansomware More\n\nThere are multiple types of ransomware out there, according to Chester Wisniewski, a senior security advisor with the computer security company Sophos. Each variation is tied to seven or eight criminal organizations.\n\nThose groups build the software and then sell it on the black market, where other criminals purchase it and then begin using it for their own gains.\n\nHow they get you\n\nRansomware doesn’t just pop up on your computer by magic. You actually have to download it. And while you could swear up and down that you’d never be tricked into downloading malware, cybercriminals get plenty of people to do just that.\n\nHere’s the thing: That email you opened to get ransomware on your computer in the first place was specifically written to get you to believe it was real. That’s because criminals use social engineering to craft their messages.\n\nFor example, hackers can determine your location and send emails that look like they’re from companies based in your country.\n\n“Criminals are looking are looking up information about where you live, so you’ll click (emails),” Wisniewski explained to Yahoo Finance. “So if you’re in America, you’ll see something from Citi Bank, rather than Deutsche Bank, which is in Germany.”\n\nStory Continues']"
05/16/2016,"['Blockchain, the company behind the world’s most popular bitcoin wallet, has been quietly working on an interesting project called Thunder. The Thunder network is an alternative network of nodes that lets you make off-chain bitcoin payments in seconds and settle back to the bitcoin blockchain every now and then. And it makes me excited about bitcoin all over again.\n\nThis sounds complicated but it’s quite neat and could be a powerful innovation for bitcoin transactions. But first, let’s take a step back.\n\nIf you’ve ever tried sending a couple of bitcoins from one wallet to another, you know it can take ten or twenty minutes before the blockchain confirms the transaction.\n\nThe reason behind this is that the blockchain is a network of servers that share the same record of transactions. When you send two bitcoins, all the nodes in the blockchain are going to write a line with this transaction so that everyone can confirm that the originating wallet has lost two bitcoins and the destination wallet now has two extra bitcoins.\n\nThis is great, and this is what makes bitcoin completely decentralized. But it’s also slow, hard to scale and expensive.\n\nLast year, Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja wrote a paper about bitcoin’s scalability and speed issues, and defined Lightning networks. These alternative networks would run independently from the main bitcoin blockchain and would be able to register transactions in just a second. It uses smart contracts so that all nodes in a Lightning network don’t need to be aware of all transactions.\n\nYet, this was all theory. Blockchain hired Mats Jerratsch and started working on a sort of implementation of a Lightning network. This is what the company is announcing and open sourcing today. Thunder is the first implementation of a Lightning-like network. Blockchain is already running Thunder nodes and other bitcoin companies can look at the source code, provide Thunder wallets, adopt this network or fork it. Thunder can also work with other cryptocurrencies. And the startup made the first live transaction on Thunder.\n\nWhile Blockchain isn’t going to use Thunder for Blockchain wallet users just yet, the startup is already thinking about real life advantages of a solution like Thunder.\n\nWith Thunder, a transaction is so fast that the network can process 100,000 transactions per second. On average, Visa handles 2,000 transactions per second and the Visa network is capable of processing 56,000 transactions per second.\n\nTo put this into perspective, Blockchain wallet users are on track to make 40 million transactions this year, or around 1.3 transaction per second. Quite impressive, but let’s be honest. While there are many other wallets out there, given that Blockchain is the most popular wallet maker, bitcoin transaction volume is very far behind Visa. The reason for this is that bitcoin transactions have been too cumbersome. So I’m convinced projects like Thunder are part of the solution.\n\nAlso important, transactions become much cheaper thanks to Thunder. When you settle back your Thunder payments to the bitcoin blockchain, there are still blockchain fees involved. But you can make many, many Thunder transactions before settling back to the blockchain — and Thunder transactions don’t involve as many nodes. If you divide the fees by the number of Thunder transactions, paying using bitcoin becomes much cheaper. Fees are so cheap that you could finally imagine making microtransactions using bitcoins.\n\nSo Thunder would make bitcoin a viable alternative to Visa. It removes many of the limitations behind the existing bitcoin protocol.\n\nNow, there are still some roadblocks. Thunder can’t work with anyone with a bitcoin wallet just yet as the bitcoin core development team needs to release segregated witness and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY features. But the good news is that these features are on the roadmap and the core team wants to make Lightning networks possible. Until then, Thunder relies on trusted nodes. But with future bitcoin updates, Thunder can become a full-on Lightning network.\n\nThunder is an exciting project and something that could drastically change some bitcoin use cases. Many have turned to alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ether due to bitcoin’s limitations. Slowly but surely, the bitcoin community is catching up and making bitcoin payments more attractive.\n\nFeatured Image: Jason Benjamin UNDER A Public Domain LICENSE', 'Gatecoin, a Hong Kong-based digital currency startup that has cited segregated client accounts as a way to minimize exposure to risks, suffered a breach and lost 250 BTC and 185,000 ETH, 15% of its crypto asset deposits.\n\nA cybersecurity firm, Tehtri Security, conducted a forensic investigation and confirmed the breach, Gatecoin announced in a statement by CEO Aurélien Menant posted on its website.\n\nThe breach took place between Monday, May 9, late night HKT, to Thursday evening HKT, 12 May 2016, the statement noted. The company noticed a disruption of service caused by a server reboot. The company said the breach is linked to this event.\n\nGatecoin Suspends Services\n\nOn Friday HKT, May 13, Gatecoin detected suspicious transactions and immediately suspended its services to investigate.\n\nMost clients’ asset funds are stored in multi-signature, cold wallets. However, the attacker managed to alter the system so that BTC and ETH deposit transfers bypassed the multi-signature cold storage and entered the hot wallet during the breach. The loss of ETH funds exceeded the 5% limit Gatecoin placed on its hot wallets.\n\nThe hot wallet breach resulted in a loss of 250 BTC and 185,000 ETH, the equivalent of $2 million USD. This represents 15% of the total crypto-asset deposits Gatecoin held.\n\nHacker Wallet Addresses Listed\n\nThus far, the forensic investigation identified the following wallet addresses used by the hackers:\n\nBitcoin Transactions:\n\n•4a1b96b166de37860195af37b6396a0516b009536e0f332006ca61b4fab0cd08\n\n•2f41b858712149df089c21d4e1c036e0a465335c5a29be38df8e945a51e4d809\n\n•271c51ff2e6c84c565c94d79872a79d77726fccd47192b6c8f6745f7482e281a\n\n•435e0cc79372eef5f43d8d81320940165ea1a0828adab3fdb9822a17caffaf2b\n\n•d494c7ca3a03f30c121b02f558b068d3597092454ad325bc320383f070d536bc\n\n•90622fc9968b79c90a9ac26f11d13d8dd97ba5b7e9c103594873e6306f7357ea\n\nEthereum Addresses:\n\n• 0x04786aada9deea2150deab7b3b8911c309f5ed90\n\n• 0xc062dceed93087c9112ff7b02d53e928e49cec09\n\n• 0x1342a001544b8b7ae4a5d374e33114c66d78bd5f\n\n• 0xd4914762f9bd566bd0882b71af5439c0476d2ff6\n\nNew Infrastructure Planned\n\nThe Gatecoin team is working with Tehtri Security to confirm all of the details related to the breach and ensure its systems can move to a new, clean, thoroughly tested and monitored infrastructure before services resume.\n\nA bespoke platform designed to allow all Gatecoin clients to withdraw remaining funds in BTC, USD, EUR, DAO, DGD, REP and HKD will be released on May 28, 2016.\n\nGatecoin has not confirmed the exact date for withdrawals for clients’ ETH funds.\n\nAll DAO, REP and DGD funds are secure, the statement noted.\n\nGatecoin has funded the DAO contracts for DAO token holders.\n\nFive percent of all Bitcoin funds were compromised in the breach.

The main reason is the fact that Bitcoin price is currently consolidating before it breaks either higher or lower. If we look at the higher timeframe chart like the weekly chart (data feed from Bitstamp) of BTC/USD, then there is a crucial breakout pattern formed.\n\nOn the downside, there is a bullish trend line formed, which is acting as a support area. On the upside, there is a major resistance near $465-470, which is acting as a hurdle for more gains in BTC. So, we can say that the price is stuck between two important levels.\n\nA break on the either side might call for a sharp move in BTC/USD. I would not suggest a buy or sell trade, instead I would say if you are looking for a medium term trade, then wait for a break before entering.

The DAO wants to be a model for a new kind of organization, created and run using blockchain software rather than conventional corporate structures.\n\nThe DAO ? an acronym for Distributed Autonomous Organization ? is similar to an open venture capital fund based on Ethereum smart contracts. Everyone can purchase DAO voting shares, called DAO tokens, with ETH (the currency unit of the Ethereum blockchain). Shares in The DAO can be purchased using ETH until May 28th. The Fortune article emphasizes that The DAO, concerned with possible regulatory issues, states its tokens are not a form of equity.\n\nVentureBeat notes that The DAO is structured as a series of smart contracts granting token holders voting rights (somewhat similar to more traditional corporate equity) and “control” over their proportion of invested ETH. The DAO’s infrastructure enables voting on any sort of expenditure the organization could make (such as hiring and paying contractors to work on their proposals, investing the ETH fund into another asset, and even “splitting” the DAO).\n\n“The DAO’s inception last Saturday led to both the highest increase of new accounts and the highest ever number of Ethereum transactions,” wrote Stephan Tual in May 6 in an article titled “The Inexorable Rise of The DAO.” Today, the DAO is about to become the largest crowdfunded project in human history, noted Erik Voorhees on May 14. “To say the DAO is a momentous event in the history of Ethereum, and blockchains in general, is an understatement,” added Tual.\n\nThe DAO is a for-profit Distributed Autonomous Organization that wants to leverage the wisdom of the crowds to benefit DAO Token Holders. According to The DAO’s Manifesto, the project wants to blaze a new path in business organization for the betterment of its members, existing simultaneously nowhere and everywhere and operating solely with the steadfast iron will of immutable code. The goal of The DAO is to diligently use the ETH it controls to support projects that will provide a return on investment or benefit to the DAO and its members, and benefit the decentralized ecosystem as a whole.\n\nAny DAO Token Holder can submit a proposal to the DAO, which can offer services that directly benefit it (improvement to the DAO code or addition of a GUI for example), or indirectly generate rewards to the DAO (in the form of a product or service). Proposals are written in plain English and backed by a software code in the form of a smart contract that defines the relationship between The DAO and the contractor: deliverables, responsibilities and operating parameters. Accepting a proposal requires a majority decision after a debating period of two weeks minimum, and a participation rate of 20 percent or higher calculated proportionally to the value of ETH requested in the proposal.\n\nThe German startup Slock.it, specializing in blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, submitted one of the proposals currently being discussed by The DAO. As reported by Bitcoin Magazine in December the company is realizing Nick Szabo’s vision of smart contracts embedded in IoT-enabled devices, with smart locks linked to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n“If you can lock it, we will let you rent, sell or share it,” promises the company’s website. “When someone purchases a Slock, it will be connected to the Slock smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain and controlled by it,” said Slock.it co-founder Christoph Jentzsch. Slock submitted to The DAO an ambitious Internet of Things (IoT) + Blockchain proposal centered on the Ethereum Computer, a multi-functional device designed to decentralize the sharing economy.\n\nJentzsch authored a DAO Whitepaper, which is considered a reference document for The DAO. “The DAO will be deployed as an exact implementation of the Standard DAO Framework,” notes The DAO’s website. “The Whitepaper therefore describes perfectly how the DAO functions and is a great place to start learning more.”\n\nAnother proposal to The DAO, submitted by Mobotiq, outlines a vision of modular electric vehicles that can be rented P2P, which is a perfect fit for the blockchain. Integration with Ethereum could enable the development of fully autonomous, self-renting vehicles.\n\nThe DAO has a distributed open governance structure, which seems to leave a door open to hostile takeovers by 51 percent attacks. As a failsafe mechanism to prevent that, there are “curators” who monitor compliance and control the whitelist, the list of contractors authorized to receive ETH from the DAO. Curators do not add centralization to the DAO; they are nominated by the DAO Token Holders themselves, and can be fired at any time, for any reason. The current DAO’s curator multisig holders include Vitalik Buterin and other leaders in the Ethereum space.\n\nInternet entrepreneur and activist David Orban, co-founder and moderator of the popular Facebook group “Bitcoin and the Internet of Money” thinks there are important reasons to invest in The DAO, besides the possibility of a good financial return.\n\n“[Participation in The DAO] doesn't imply or promise that the exchange rate of DAO Tokens and ETH with any other digital or fiat currency should increase in favor of DAO,” says Orban. “On the other hand, just participating, with any even minuscule amount, allows the acquisition of hands-on knowledge in what aims to be a revolutionary platform for decentralized project management and resource allocation.”\n\nOrban is persuaded that The DAO can be a pathfinder and a model for very ambitious crowdfunded initiatives to tackle important challenges, including a new global phase of the space program. “With The ?AO now being implemented this is starting to make sense,” says Orban. “From the $10M order of magnitude crowdsales two years ago, to the $100M crowdsale today, we will get to $1B in a couple of years, and then to $10B in another two-three. Those are meaningful numbers to fund a Mars mission (if not a Mars colony yet).”\n\nSee also this author’s 2009 essay on “A Virtual World Space Agency,” which didn’t mention DAOs only because the concept wasn’t yet popular at the time."", 'The new approach, which prevents clinical trial documents from being altered to make new medications look more effective, was developed by Greg Irving, of the University of Cambridge, and John Holden – both practicing doctors concerned about the trustworthiness of clinical trials.\n\n“Outcome switching, data dredging and selective publication are some of the problems that undermine the integrity of published research\u200b,” Irving told Outsourcing-Pharma. “Yet, despite the creation of numerous trial registries, problems such as differences between pre-specified and reported outcomes persist\u200b.”\n\nTo address these concerns, Irvin and Holden applied Bitcoin’s block chain technology to clinical trial reports. A blockchain, which was invented in 2008 to create Bitcoin, is a decentralized database of bitcoin transactions, in which every transaction is publically recorded, timestamped, and stored across a computer network, thus creating a distributed ledger.\n\n“We were aware of reports how distributed ledger technology could provide new tools to reduce fraud, error and the cost of paper intensive processes in other industries and thought it would be interesting to apply this to clinical science\u200b,” explained Irving.\n\nAccording to a report\u200b by the UK Government Office for Science, distributed ledger technology “offers the potential to improve health care by improving and authenticating the delivery of services and by sharing records securely according to exact rules\u200b.”\n\n“It is a simple and cheap way of allowing a third party to audit and externally validate outcomes and analyses\u200b,” added Irving.\n\nHow it works\u200b\n\nA unique digital signature determined by the clinical trial document’s text, using the SHA256 Calculator, is given to the original clinical protocol. The signature is then converted into a public bitcoin key in a transaction that is timestamped and recorded as a blockchain.\n\nTo check whether a clinical protocol has been altered, anyone is able to generate a new bitcoin key using the document’s text. If the key differs to that in the blockchain, then alterations in the text have been made.\n\nAccording to Irving, a feasibility study would be an important next step. “We hope the approach could be used to strengthen existing clinical trial registries\u200b,” he added. “In future, blockchain notary services may be able to simplify and automate the process of study protocol and outcome verification\u200b.”\n\nThe method’s application to a randomized clinical trial on cardiovascular diabetes and ethanol was recently reported in a paper which has passed peer review on the open science publishing platform F1000Research.', 'In its final report on virtual currencies and distributed ledger technology concerning the likes of bitcoin and blockchain tech, the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has spoken about the possibility of revising existing EU payment laws, due to the innovations afforded by virtual currencies and blockchain technology.\n\nThe European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) has recently released its final report (PDF) on virtual currencies (VC) and blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT). In it, the ECON lists the opportunities and risks associated with the innovations in the landscape of payments and beyond.\n\nThe sweeping pointer-laden report covers plenty of subjects concerning bitcoin (specifically) and blockchain technology and merits a read.\n\nThe beginning of the explanatory statement reads:\n\nSeven years after the launch of Bitcoin, the first and most prominent virtual currency (VC), it has become clear that the underlying innovation, distributed ledger technology (DLT) is set to have a significant impact on the financial sector and beyond.\n\nBitcoin Regulation and Research via the European Commission\n\nAmong its many pointers, the ECON acknowledged and welcomed the suggestion of the European Commission (the executive arm of the European Union), to include virtual currency exchanges under the umbrella of the Anti-Money-Laundering Directive (AMLD) in a direct effort to end the anonymity which comes with bitcoin transfers. The suggestion was made by the European Commission earlier in February this year.\n\nIn its next point, the ECON urged the Commission to study bitcoin and virtual currencies to then consider revising existing EU payment legislations with the innovation at hand.\n\n[The ECON] recommends that the Commission draw up a comprehensive analysis of VCs and, on the basis of this assessment, consider, if appropriate, revising the relevant EU legislation on payments.\n\nThe report specifically mentions the following legislations in the view of seeking to revise them in the future. They are:\n\nThe Payment Accounts Directive (PAD)\n\nThe Payment Services Directive (PSD)\n\nThe Electronic Money Directive (EMD)\n\nThe report continued:\n\n[Seek revisions to EU legislations] in light of the new possibilities afforded by new technological developments including VCs and DLT, with a view to further enhancing competition and lowering transaction costs, including by means of enhanced interoperability and possibility also via the promotion of a universal and non-proprietary electronic wallet.\n\nThe final report also called for the creation of a distributed ledger technology task force (TF DLT), consisting of technically proficient virtual currency and blockchain efforts and regulators, led by the European Commission. The proposal was previously made in February this year.\n\nThe full report is available here [PDF].\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Most people in the Bitcoin community know Paul Sztorc for his work on the Truthcoin concept (now backed by Roger Ver and currently in development as Bitcoin Hivemind), but the former Yale statistician also recently joined blockchain startup Bloq (of which Bitcoin Core contributor Jeff Garzik is a co-founder) under the role of economist.\n\nIn a recent message to the Bitcoin development mailing list, Sztorc attempted to jump-start the conversation on a potential BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to enable two-way pegged sidechains on the Bitcoin network.\n\nSztorc noted the inclusion of a new opcode (currently going by the name OP_CheckVotesVerify) that could be added to Bitcoin via a soft fork. Although the main purpose of his email was to kick off the technical discussion around a specific two-way peg implementation, Sztorc also noted four of the key benefits that sidechains may bring to Bitcoin.\n\n1. Optional Hard Forks\n\nThe first benefit of sidechains mentioned by Sztorc was what he called “optional hard forks.” He noted, “Sidechains allow 'opt in' adoption of new features.”\n\nIn addition to allowing innovation to take place that would usually happen on a blockchain in an alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) network, Sztorc added that the changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules found in Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT could also be implemented as sidechains.\n\nWhen those alternative protocol designs are implemented as sidechains, it makes the changes optional because users can still decide to remain on the main Bitcoin blockchain. If Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin XT were implemented via a hard fork (activated by 75 percent support from the network hashrate), it would essentially coerce everyone on the network to play by these new rules.\n\n2. Staging Upgrades\n\nAccording to Sztorc, sidechains also allow Bitcoin to be upgraded in stages. He explained:\n\n“Sidechains allow complex updates to Bitcoin to be tested in a realistic environment (where actual BTC are at risk and utilizing actual network mining resources). If these updates fail, they can be revised; if they succeed, they can be incorporated into the mainchain.”\n\nCurrently, new features are not tested on the live Bitcoin network. Instead, test networks are created to try out new features without risking large amounts of real value. For a large portion of the Bitcoin community, including Sztorc, altcoins are mainly viewed as testnets.\n\n3. Directing Blockchain Resources to Bitcoin\n\nWith the flexibility offered by sidechains, it makes more sense for resources (developers, money, public attention, etc.) to be directed toward the Bitcoin currency network. Instead of splitting the idea of cryptocurrency into many different networks, sidechains allow the vast majority of the innovation to take place on the same network. In this regard, sidechains are intended to strengthen Bitcoin’s network effects.\n\n4. Returning to a Culture of Permissionless Innovation\n\nOne last benefit of sidechains mentioned by Sztorc was that, with this improvement to Bitcoin, more time can be spent on permissionless innovation.\n\nSidechains mean “less time spent debating controversial features,” he said.\n\nThis final point ties in with the first point of optional hard forks. With sidechains, consensus from the entire network is not needed to try out something new.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nAlthough the sidechains concept has received large amounts of interest and praise from the Bitcoin community (both technical and otherwise), doubts still exist. Most notably, Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd has voiced his concerns over the security of merge-mined sidechains.\n\nAs recently as this month, Todd has said, “[Merge-mined sidechains] are a broken idea that fundamentally means miners have the ability to steal coins, and makes the scaling problem a lot worse.”\n\nBitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen (who often disagrees with Todd’s point of view) also sees possible issues with sidechains. In a recent AMA on 8btc, Andresen wrote, “I think sidechains are a good idea, but the main problem is finding a good way to keep them secure.”\n\nThe most recent work in regard to a two-way peg mechanism for sidechains comes in the form of a paper by RSK Labs (the company behind Rootstock) co-founder and Chief Scientist Sergio Lerner. The paper builds on work by Blockstream on the original sidechains concept and a more-recent proposal, drivechains, from Sztorc."", 'Coin Citadel, the company that has been involved in bitcoin-based business for a while, has now decided to increase its bitcoin holding by over $750,000 in the coming days. The announcement was made by the company in a press release earlier today.\n\nWhile Coin Citadel has already explained about its intentions to increase its holdings, the company has not divulged any specific details about from where the company will be receiving the bitcoin. But by raising about 1,675 bitcoins as part of the non-dilutive stock transition, the company’s total holding will stand at 2,251 bitcoins, which is over $1 million.\n\nIn addition, Coin Citadel has revealed that the company is also acquiring two additional assets, the details of which will be revealed only after another week. James Pulver, the CEO of Coin Citadel was quoted in the press release saying:\n\n“My job is to add value to the company and to take advantage of opportunities like this. The more prudent acquisitions we make and assets we have, the more valuable out the company will be. With this Bitcoin asset, we will have over $1 million in bitcoins to complement out new upcoming acquisitions. With everything falling into place we feel we are moving forward in the right direction.”\n\nCoin Citadel has been in and out of the bitcoin sector for a while. Earlier last year, the company launched its first Bitcoin ATM in California. Before that, Coin Citadel was the owner of Bitcoiner7, a bitcoin exchange, which is not operational anymore. Listed on OTCMarkets.com, Coin Citadel is working its way towards regaining ‘current’ status on the platform. The bitcoin and other acquisitions currently in the books are all part of the same plan.\n\nIt is not sure, what the company has been up to in the recent days, but the company’s profile on OTCMarkets.com shows that Coin Citadel was originally incorporated in 1986 as Fertility Advancements Inc. Since then the company has changed its name and core areas of business a number of times.\n\nThe future plans of Coin Citadel are not yet known, but maybe, the company will enlighten the bitcoin community about it in the coming days. We also look forward to knowing more about it then.\n\nRef: PR Image: NewsBTC', 'As the Bitcoin’s halving approaches, many are wondering whether it will double Bitcoin’s price to compensate for the halved supply, or will lead to a downward spiral and a depressed price due to the growth of confirmation delays.\n\nOn July 11th, only two months away, supply halves. Prices should increase, assuming demand remains constant, with many Bitcoiners hoping that the halving will trigger a fourth moon bubble comparable to the stratospheric rise in 2011, Spring 2013 and November 2013. Some argue, however, that this time it may be different because for the first time in its history Bitcoin has a capped transaction capacity.\n\nTransaction volume and price\n\nThe relationship between price and transaction volume has been identified as early as 2013 with the following chart showing a remarkable correlation:\n\nBitcoin’s Metcalf’s Law – Source: Peter Rizun\n\nDue to Bitcoin’s transaction cap, the price has recently seen what many commentators suggest is an unprecedented level of stability, inching towards the range of $470. It may yet break higher, especially as we get closer to the halving, but such breakouts are usually followed by an increased level of transactions, which causes increased delays, leading to complaints and a potential break on price advances.\n\nIf this pattern is repeated and the price does not compensate for the reduced supply, the least profitable miners may turn off their hashrate, leading to further mining centralization.\n\nConcerns\n\nConcerns have been raised that during the two-week period between miners turning off their hashrate and difficulty readjustment, confirmation delays may be exacerbated as blocks take longer to be found. This leads to an increase in fees and a reduction in price, making even more unprofitable miners turn off their hashrate in what may be a downward spiral.\n\nIn response to such concerns it is likely that huge mining farms have taken precautions to prevent any downward spiral. Moreover, according to recent analysis, some pool’s profitability is as high as 135%, with most standing above 100%, but Kano pool, which currently has approximately 2% network wide hash-share is only 65% profitable.\n\nOnce supply is halved, they may be operating at a loss. Some other pools, such as Antpool, stand at only 105%, which would be reduced by the halving to a tight margin of 5%, assuming no further difficulty increases. At that margin, a profit could quickly turn to a loss.\n\nJihan Wu, co-founder of Antpool/Bitmain, one of the biggest mining pools and hashrate operators, perhaps recognizing the difficulties that miners may face, has recently made some tweets indicating displeasure at the lack of capacity increase.\n\nLike many other miners who signed the Hong Kong agreement, he would have hoped that segwit could have come to the rescue, but as another softfork is currently in process with barely 35% miner adoption, with segwit not yet released even in mid-May, and the halving only two months away, any such rescue is probably months away leading to the transaction capacity question regaining steam.\n\nSpycoin possible\n\nIn a recent post, Roger Ver, one of the earliest and most vocal proponents of Bitcoin, articulated the position of many in the big block side. Painting a picture of competition in a free market, he argued that if Bitcoin does not provide access then banks will provide a Spy Coin, leading in the long term to a certain eventuality that everyone transacts in a controlled blockchain.\n\nAccording to Ver, Bitcoin currently has the opportunity to bring its empowering qualities to the masses and thus, potentially, create a more equitable future. Therefore, it should move faster to retain a competitive edge.\n\nCurrently, however, Bitcoin is paralyzed, with a transaction cap pricing out businesses, fees increasing, censorship leading to a distorted and divided community and promised capacity increases likely delayed for months.\n\nBitcoin’s decentralized nature, may, nonetheless, show its resilience, as many “buy the story and sell the news” according to Patrick Dugan, Board member of the Omni Foundation, formerly Mastercoin. Despite the current difficulties, therefore, the price may nonetheless double regardless.', '']"
05/17/2016,"['Blockchain has announced the alpha release of its latest Thunder Network capable of handling loads of off-chain transactions in a faster and more economical way compared to the present day Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBlockchain, the Bitcoin wallet company has announced the alpha release of its latest Thunder Network, a payment channel technology designed to accelerate bitcoin transactions over the blockchain.\n\nCall it Bitcoin blockchain on steroids, the Thunder Network was introduced earlier amid the block size debate over Bitcoin’s scalability. Thanks to 1 MB limit on bitcoin blocks, the Bitcoin network has been unable to handle the ever increasing number of digital currency transactions. With the network failing to adapt to the growth in bitcoin usage, it failed to process/confirm transactions as and when it happened. This led to a huge backlog where the transactions which usually took a couple of minutes to receive confirmation started taking hours. Increasing backlogs created an increased demand for priority confirmation among users, which in turn led to an increase in miner fees. Increased miner fee for transactions has made the concept of microtransactions with bitcoin redundant. Lightning Network, on the other hand, is introduced as a solution for these issues.\n\nThunder Network is Blockchain’s adoption of the Lightning Network for off-chain transactions. It uses smart contracts to offer trustless peer to peer transaction capabilities over a high-speed network. Blockchain’s announcement about the launch of its Thunder Network makes it the first company to implement a usable Lightning Network in its product.\n\nAccording to the company, the Thunder Network developed by Mats Jerratsch allows people to make live, instant and ultra-cheap transactions which will be settled back on the main Bitcoin blockchain. Even though the Thunder Network uses an overlying protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is perfectly capable of offering increased user privacy while handling large amounts of transactions at the same time.\n\nBlockchain, in its blog post, clarifies that the Thunder Network is an alpha product and it is expected to stay that way for a while as it can’t be implemented on the Bitcoin blockchain on a protocol level until bot CSV and SegWit are included to it. This release should be used only by developers and those who want to experiment with it by using it within a trusted friends circle.\n\nThunder Network is found to outdo Visa when it comes to its capability of handling transactions. Blockchain has found it capable of handling more than 100000 transactions per second. At the same time, with the transactions happening off-chain, the transaction fee will be much lower compared to the miner fee charged on each on-chain transaction.\n\nThe AES-CTR encryption and authentication protocols combined with multiple node encrypted routing ensures the security and privacy of all transactions over the network. All these features include the irrevocability of payments makes Thunder Network better than the vanilla Bitcoin blockchain when it comes to peer to peer bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe day is not far off when Lightning Network based payment system gets widely implemented across the Bitcoin network. But Blockchain’s move to announce its Thunder Network will give it a first-mover edge over other similar networks that are yet to follow.\n\nRef: Blockchain Image: NewsBTC', 'About The Author\n\nEduardo Gómez is a Computer Science Major from Venezuela, a country with a loyal Bitcoin user base. He discovered Bitcoin in 2012 and now he use it to escape the triple-digit inflation that Venezuela suffers, he is focusing on developing a writing career, and he tries to keep up with the news in FinTech and Blockchain Technologies.', 'ANX International, a Hong Kong-based virtual-currency trading startup and fintech company, is inviting people to issue their own digital assets using blockchain technology, according to Bloomberg. The service is intended to make setting up a blockchain-based assets and trading network as easy as signing up for an email account.\n\nBlockchain technology can enable the buying and selling of any asset, from loyalty points to stocks and bonds. Blockchain systems can remove the need for middlemen such as banks and governments, making it an attractive way to create exchanges.\n\nSet Up Account In Minutes\n\nANX claims its service allows anyone make a blockchain account in minutes and select how many digital assets to create.\n\nThe technology for issuing blockchain-based assets has been in development for the past three years, according to Ken Lo, the company’s CEO. ANX has used the technology internally for its biggest clients, including an e-commerce company that wanted to operate a loyalty program. Companies can set up reward programs without complex back-office processes. They can also reduce fraud risk.\n\nLo stated:\n\nI can tell you now the demand for people wanting to get blockchain services is very high — that’s why we’ve decided to systematize it. We’re helping the general public get access to blockchain by lowering the barriers to using the technology.\n\nFocus: Customized Digital Assets, Blockchain\n\nANX International launched in 2013 by co-founders Lo, Hugh Madden and Dave Chapman. The company set up a bitcoin retail store in Hong Kong two years ago. With about 100 employees, the company has not raised venture funding since its first angel investment. Its main revenue source is from helping clients make customized digital assets and blockchains.\n\nJeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, said businesses and organizations seeking any type of loyalty system will want to use distributed ledger technology for this purpose since it is interoperable, secure and global. It is also exchangeable for other types of assets. However, noted, “We’re a ways from that because we’re not even in a world where digital currency is accepted.”\n\nHow It Works\n\nA cafe owner could sign up for ANX’s blockchain service and issue customer reward points, for example. Every time a customer buys coffee, they can scan a QR code on their phone and get points to exchange for future coffee purchases. The proprietor can then track the points and exchange them at any time.\n\nNasdaq OMX Group Inc. is using distributed ledger technology to issue shares. Universities use it to give out academic certificates. Banks are investing in blockchain technology because it provides a way to process any kind of trade or money transfer in minutes rather than days.\n\nMost experimentation being done by the world of finance and companies with extensive resources.\n\n“Once you drive the price down to zero, then you’ll see a lot more uses for it. The biggest problem now in blockchain is education and exposure,” Lo said.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', 'Cointelegraph announces the release of our brand new Bitcoin Price Index - a comprehensive tool for tracking Bitcoin price changes and historical data, analyzing the market and making trading decisions.\n\nIt is an easy way to track Bitcoin exchange rates and keep an eye on the value of Bitcoin.\n\nThe index was developed in co-operation with BitcoinChain.com, a “one-stop shop” which has been providing general information on the cryptocurrency industry and quality tools for Bitcoin analytics since 2013.\n\nWhat is CoinTelegraph’s Bitcoin Price Index?\n\nAs such, the CT’s Price Index is aimed at delivering all the latest essential Bitcoin data in an efficient, yet accessible form.\n\nOur index offers the most popular features required by the general audience and, at the same time, covers the needs of the more demanding groups, such as traders and market analysts.\n\nAggregated Bitcoin price ticker\n\nAggregated Bitcoin price ticker is available in 5 currencies: EUR, USD, GBP, CNY and RUB.\n\nThe index aggregates data from multiple leading cryptocurrency exchanges: OKCoin, Kraken, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Bitstamp, CEX.IO, HitBTC, Btc-E, Gemini and itBit.\n\nThe price is displayed as the average weighted by trading volume, which is calculated by taking the sum of all the prices, multiplied by the volume of the trade and then divided by the entire volume:\n\nBitcoin price graphs\n\nOur tool can display actual and historical data from each one of the exchanges mentioned above, going as far back as a year ago.\n\nThe price graphs can be displayed in any of the 5 supported currencies, within adjustable time periods.\n\nOne of the main advantages of the graph tool is the option to display either line or candle graphs, depending on your own personal needs.\n\nBitcoin market analysis\n\nThere is now an option to use tools for technical analysis right on the graph.\n\nGraphical tools:\n\nHorizontal lines for marking different levels of the price.

Bitcoin has in fact, the power to disrupt the online gambling space.\n\nSince the beginning of the Internet, the gambling industry has always been an adopter of all new online technologies that have been coming around. However, for some time now, the online gambling industry has been dealing with heavy regulatory impositions all over the world and many companies tried to find out new ways of going pass those restrictions.\n\nIt was in 2009, that Bitcoin was introduced to the world and the gambling Industry rapidly adopts this new currency. Bitcoin came to revolutionise the gambling industry, and since 2010, we start to see new gambling sites being launched that only accepted this new currency.\n\nBitcoin came to give a new momentum to the gambling Industry, and I might say that it even led companies to implement innovations and develop new business models.\n\nOne of these innovative gambling sites launched back in 2012 was Dragon’s Tale. This was a completely original gambling site. Dragon’s Tale was one of the first online Bitcoin Casinos to be launched, and this was no ordinary gambling site. Dragon’s Tale was to first to introduce a new gambling style: an online massively multiplayer casino role play game.\n\nBecause of its inherent characteristics and its decentralised nature Bitcoin has become very appealing to the gambling industry. There are all sorts of aspects that we could mention that confers Bitcoin its ingenious utility to the gambling industry. Besides all the innovation that Bitcoin brought to the gambling industry, its decentralised nature also came as a saviour to face the increasing government restrictions all over the world. Since governments everywhere have been imposing a lot of regulations on gambling and online casinos, Bitcoin became the perfect workaround to avoid these restrictions. Anyone living in a country where online gambling is heavily regulated can easily gamble with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin transactions are also very cheap. So, Casinos can lower their commissions and still get the same incentive. Since anyone can verify all the transactions in the Blockchain it allows greater financial transparency making it more secure using Bitcoin to gamble.\n\nBitcoin is the currency of the internet; it is perfectly aligned to support online based businesses and facilitates international transactions.

(sha/dmr)', ""As of this weekend, GreenAddress is the first Bitcoin wallet to include a replace-by-fee option. With it, users can increase fees on their transactions with the click of a button--a feature welcomed by some, as it increases the likelihood a miner will include a transaction in a block. This can help transactions get “unstuck” in case of heavy transaction load, and benefits fee market dynamics. Others dispute the feature; critics fear that replace-by-fee could harm reliability of unconfirmed transactions, as payments can in some cases be reverted.\n\nTo test the feature, GreenAddress enabled a preview of the option on my own GreenAddress wallet several weeks ago. This, in turn, allowed me to test which parts of the broader Bitcoin ecosystem are ready for replace-by-fee – and which parts are not.\n\nThe results below are based on ad hoc experimentation from my own perspective as a user – not an official analysis conducted with scientific precision.\n\nGreenAddress from the Sender’s Perspective\n\nThe first test, of course, was GreenAddress itself, from the sender's perspective. (Tested on the Chrome extension version of the wallet.)\n\nSince this weekend, the GreenAddress replace-by-fee option is switched on by default. (Users that don’t want to utilize the feature need to disable it in the “Settings” panel.) When switched on, each transaction sent from the wallet includes a replace-by-fee flag. This way, network nodes and miners know it's eligible to be replaced by a conflicting transaction that includes a higher fee.\n\nAfter sending my first replace-by-fee transaction, I was automatically redirected to the “Transactions” screen, where all past wallet-transactions are displayed. And, underneath the (still unconfirmed) replace-by-fee transaction, a new tab had appeared: “bump fee.”\n\nWhile opt-in replace-by-fee as included in Bitcoin Core allows replacing any unconfirmed transaction (even if this means unconfirmed transactions are “canceled”), GreenAddress users can only resend bitcoins from the same inputs to the same outputs, but with a higher fee. It only allows users to “boost” a transaction to increase the likelihood a miner will include it in a block.\n\nClicking on the “bump fee” tab opens a mini-menu. On top of the menu, text displays how fast the transaction is expected to confirm. In my case, it was expected to be included in the next block. Nevertheless, the menu allowed me to bump the fee: times 1.5, times 2 or times 3.\n\nHowever, and more important, if a transaction is not expected to be mined in the first available block because the fee is too low, GreenAddress offers a different option. In that case, the mini-menu offers users the option to include a fee big enough to have the transaction included in the next two, three or six blocks.\n\nHaving bumped the fee, a new icon appears underneath the transaction, which reads “updated,” accompanied by a button to display the old transaction ID. Meanwhile, the “bump fee” button is still there, too, meaning I could bump the fee once again.\n\nAll in all a very straightforward and easy-to-use process.\n\nWhat the Pools Are Doing\n\nWallet software in itself is not sufficient to replace transactions. (Or: bump fees.) Whether replace-by-fee is active on the Bitcoin network really depends on miners.\n\nA series of test transactions revealed that a majority of miners currently does not apply any replace-by-fee policy. All of the big Chinese pools – AntPool, F2Pool, BTCC and BW.com – ignored the fee boosted transactions completely, as did KnCMiner. This currently adds up to more than 75 percent of hash power on the network.\n\nOther pools did apply a replace-by-fee policy, presumably the opt-in version. These include BitFury, Slush Pool, BitClub and CKPool, which adds up to nearly 20 percent of all hash power. (The other 5 percent of hash power on the network is controlled by pools or miners representing less than 1 percent of hash power, which didn’t happen to mine any blocks during my tests..)\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nWhile 20 percent may seem low, it's actually not so bad when keeping in mind the main purpose of replace-by-fee: “boosting” a fee to ensure a transaction is mined.\n\nOf course, with only 20 percent of hash power applying a replace-by-fee policy, there’s only a 20 percent chance the very next miner will pick up the boosted transaction. But there is also about a 3-out-of-4 chance that the boosted transaction will be included in a block within one hour. And it will almost certainly be included in a block within several hours.\n\nNeedless to say, that is a significant improvement compared to transactions that won't confirm for days, as has been the case during some “stress tests” on the network.\n\nUsers who want to (ab)use replace-by-fee to revert an unconfirmed transaction, meanwhile, only have about a 20 percent chance this will succeed. At least 75 percent of the time they’ll pay their “victim” even though they didn’t want to. (Reverting a transaction isn’t possible with GreenAddress in the first place, of course.)\n\nWallet Security\n\nUsers maliciously reverting unconfirmed transactions bring us to the next point.\n\nTo counter these risks, wallet software can warn users on the receiving end of a transaction if a transaction is flagged to potentially be replaced.\n\nOf all tested wallets, however, only Mycelium (on Android) and – indeed – GreenAddress (Chrome app) show such a flag. Both wallets clearly visualize a replace-by-fee enabled transaction as such, giving users the option not to accept such a transaction until confirmed if they wish. (AirBitz apparently does it too, but I don’t have the right operating system to test this myself.)\n\nInterestingly, Bitcoin Core doesn't flag for incoming opt-in replace-by-fee transactions, and as such Bitcoin Core forks Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Unlimited don't either. Rather, these wallets simply show both the original and the replacement transaction as unconfirmed. Until one of these transactions makes it into a block, of course, at which point the confirmed transaction is shown as confirmed - and the conflicting transaction as rejected.\n\nBlockchain (web), Bither (iOS 7), Blocktrail (iOS 7 and web), Breadwallet (iOS 7), Coinbase (web), Copay (iOS 7) and Electrum (desktop) don't flag for replace-by-fee transactions either. Blocktrail, Bither and Breadwallet simply show both the original and the boosted transactions as two different incoming transactions, while Copay and Coinbase ignore the latter. For Electrum, it depends on which Electrum server the wallet software connects to, but in most cases it shows only the newest transaction.\n\n(When asked why their software doesn't flag for replace-by-fee transactions, both Bitcoin Core and Electrum developers explained that unconfirmed transactions shouldn't be trusted either way, and a flagging system could give users a false sense of security.)\n\nEditors note: Shortly before publication, Bitcoin Core developers pointed out that an RBF-notification might be added soon, after all.\n\nWhile unable to test it myself, Bitcoin Wallet (Android) applies yet another strategy: it doesn't show replace-by-fee flagged transactions at all, unless and until it has at least one confirmation.\n\n(Bitcoin Wallet developer Andreas Schildbach told me adding a flagging system in the software would be tricky, and he believes this is the most responsible solution for now.)\n\nPayment Processors\n\nI tested the big two payment processors: BitPay and Coinbase. This time around, I didn't actually try to replace (“boost”) my transaction. I just wanted to see how they'd handle the flag.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly – CEO Stephen Pair supports opt-in replace-by-fee – BitPay seemed to handle replace-by-fee payments without any problems. Having paid for a pizza delivery through Bitcoin's biggest payment processor, the order was immediately confirmed on-screen. As such, it didn't feel like I was waiting too long for my transaction to come through.\n\nIt did, however, take several minutes – seemingly until a block was found – until I also received a confirmation email. Presumably this is because BitPay does wait “behind the screens” until a transaction is included in a block, to make sure they can't be defrauded.\n\nWhile it worked well for me, it did leave me wondering what would happen if the transaction had taken significantly longer to confirm. If that would have meant I had to wait longer for my pizza to arrive, a warning might have been in place...\n\nCoinbase did not handle my first replace-by-fee transaction well: my payment for Reddit Gold, made several weeks ago, was not acknowledged at all. Not before it was included in a block, and not after it was included in a block. After seeing the payment request page time out twice, the order was eventually canceled. (I had to email Reddit to get my gold.)\n\nHowever, a second, more recent try suggests Coinbase has improved its service since: my Wikimedia donation was confirmed instantly. Moreover, a message popped up telling me they’d wait for a confirmation due to a low fee. Wrong reason, but right service.\n\nBlock Explorers\n\nFinally, I did a quick round to see how different block explorers handle opt-in replace-by-fee transactions.\n\nThe first block explorer I tested, Blocktrail, clearly visualizes replace-by-fee transactions. It was the only block explorer that not only flags a transaction when eligible for double-spends, it also warns users if a conflicting transaction is detected. And, once that conflicting transaction is included in a block, it's made clear that the replaced transaction was double-spent, and won't confirm.\n\nBlockchain.info does not flag replaceable transactions, and instead just shows a transaction as unconfirmed. It's only after a conflicting transaction is sent that Blockchain.info visualizes a note warning users of a potential double-spend, though still no mention of replace-by-fee. And, after a conflicting transaction is included in a block, Blockchain.info issues no additional warning; it seems as if there is still a small chance the original transaction might confirm.\n\nAs for other block explorers ...\n\nMuch like Blockchain.info, Blockcypher does not visualize a replace-by-fee flag, but it does show a double-spend warning after a second transaction is sent. BitPay's open source block explorer insight.bitpay.com, bitcoinchain.com and chain.so show only the first initial transaction, with no replace-by-fee flag."", 'European bitcoin exchange CEX.IO has announced a milestone of over $40 million in fiat currency deposits via payment cards. The figure underlines users’ preference of purchasing bitcoins with credit and payment cards over other conventional methods.\n\nLondon-based CEX.IO has announced that it has seen over $40 million in fiat currency deposits made toward its exchange for buying bitcoins from credit cards.\n\nIn an emailed release to CCN, the European bitcoin exchange was among the earliest ones to add payment cards as a means to deposit funds. VISA and Mastercard payment cards are the most commonly used payment means by users to buy the cryptocurrency.\n\nMore recently, virtual cards such as Payoneer, Neteller and Netspend are also among the payment methods accepted by the exchange. Altogether, the bitcoin exchange has processed deposits in excess of $40 million so far.\n\nIn a statement, Oleksandr Lutskevych, CEO and Co-Founder of CEX.IO said:\n\nWe operate as a broad and reliable bridge between people who are willing to buy Bitcoin and the blockchain industry. As credit cards are still the most common thing in users’ pockets, no matter what country they come from, we decided to direct our efforts on user-friendly, fast and cheap Bitcoin purchases using payment cards.\n\nThe exchange expects the aggressive growth to carry on, with its claim of 600,000 registered users – all of whom will also be enabled with instant withdrawals to payment cards in USD, EUR and RUB.\n\n“Recently announced withdrawals to Visa and MasterCard from CEX.IO is another breakthrough feature that was very awaited by our existing and potential customers,” he added.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Cryptocurrency allows immunity from interjections and the handling of central banks. It gives us freedom of our economic management. CoinTelegraph talked to Pascal H. Hamonic, a core member of Nu (NuBits), decentralized startup in peer-to-peer banking, Petros Anagnostou, Chief Marketing Officer, and Mourad Ilyes Mlik, IT Engineer, of CreditBit, an open source software project released under the MIT/X11 license, about alternative cryptocurrencies and fintech innovations.\n\nCryptocurrency compared to fiat is neither stored nor checked by central banks or governments. You possess all your money, and the system is secure thanks to the peer technology Peer2Peer. The counterfeiting is unfeasible.\n\nJulien Yuki Hamonic, core member of Nubits, says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“A new thought form to structure organizations is emerging: the Blockchain. Take a look at Nu, the DAO which is issuing the dollar pegged US-NBT. NuShareholders mirror holographically the whole blockchain, this pattern of blockchain is being found again in another scale of itself, B&C exchange. Though its parts are not related by any hierarchical relationship, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and produce a meaningful business value. May the Blockchain be spread fractally, holographically and synergistically!”\n\nProof of validation\n\nCT: The coin Nubits since it is a PoS, has a form of currency and NuShares is the solution for Proof of Validation, that way solves the problem that PoS have?\n\nPascal H. Hamonic: The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), called Nu is a DAC whose business is to issue stable crypto-currencies, called NuBits. Nu is a fork of Peershares which is a fork of peercoin.\n\nAs you may know, Peercoin is the first PoS coin. So Nu is indeed PoS. The way it works is that shareholders who hold NuShares vote. By voting they contribute to the business of the DAC (Nu). By doing so, they contribute to the security of the network by verifying blocks.\n\nThe probability of being able to verify a block depends on how much percentage you own. So let us say that you have 10% of Nu. In that case, 10% of the time you will be able to verify blocks. By the way, 1 block per minute with Nu (=NuBits + NuShares).\n\nInvestments and Visa/MasterCard payment option\n\nCT: Do you plan issuing new shares to get investment?\n\nPH: Shareholders of Nu hold shares called NuShares. With NuShares they vote for anything, including monetary policies. Nu would need to issue new NuShares in order to maintain the peg, if needed. We did that twice last year.\n\nCT: How do you get rewards, the wallet is a node?\n\nPH: Well when you verify blocks, you get a reward (a minting reward or a voting reward if you will), which is right 40 NuShares per block. Yes, the wallet is a node. Well if you want to verify blocks, you need to enable the minting function though.\n\nCT: The merchants if they want to accept Nubits, will this be implemented by Visa or MasterCard as other currencies have done?\n\nPH: Right now the best way to pay with NuBits is to use NuDroid (android wallet). With it, you can pay any merchants with NuBits who accept Bitcoin. As for the credit card payment, we have only NanoCard of CCEDK right now. With NanoCard you can charge with NuBits.\n\nPrice and wallet\n\nCT: The price has to be kept steady at 1$ but at coin market I see ups and downs, how this could affect the Nubits?\n\nPH: It is a peg around 1USD -+ 0.2%. The peg has been kept quite tightly overall since the inception.\n\nCT: The Shareholders of NuShares, how they been informed for the voting system, and are they capable to be notified by the wallet?\n\nPH: Mainly we discuss everything inside the forum. But we have indicators of the liquidity such as inside the client or here. There are some plans to alert shareholders about certain things inside the wallets such as mandatory updates or any other urgent messages.\n\nCT: Do you monitor from which countries the users are more interested in the project?\n\nPH: We have some indicators. So it is pretty well spread over the Globe: US, Canada, Europe (Germany, UK, Spain, Greece, France), China, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, South America. With NuBits, you can remit US dollars for very cheap (1 cent) and instantly.\n\nNu is the first decentralized central bank in the world who issue NuBits, the first crypto-dollar with a stable prize 1NBT = 1USD. Value stability is highly desirable in a currency, and we expect more and more users will begin using NuBits for online purchases.\n\nWhat is CreditBit\n\nPetros Anagnostou: CreditBit is an open source digital currency protocol which is 10 times better than Bitcoin when it comes to the speed and rate of transactions. CreditBit prepares for mass adoption by offering a user-friendly and secure cryptocurrency easily accessible to users worldwide.\n\nCT: Are transactions traceable?\n\nMourad Ilyes Mlik: CreditBit was Asic resistant at the PoW stage, now the PoW stage has ended and we are a pure PoS coin so we don't have issues with ASICs or 51% attacks. Creditbit transactions are traceable, you can gain anonymity by using coin mixers.\n\nCT: Which platform wallets do CreditBit support?\n\nPA: CreditBit has wallets for all platforms (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux) and the wallet works as a peer. About 2700 wallets between Creditbit-QT and Electrum have been downloaded up until now .\n\nCreditbit is already in 7 exchanges: (Bittrex - Livecoin - YoBit - C-Cex - Cryptopia - Bloombit - Bitsquare). It is one of the fastest coins with extremely fast confirmations.\n\nBitcoin’s problem is the confirmations delays. Many times it needs 30 minutes to find one block and get one confirmation. CreditBit’s blocks are found every 30 seconds from POS.\n\nImplementation\n\nCT: Does only the official wallet gain 8% annually?\n\nMIL: Yes, only the wallet Creditbit-QT which runs at Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, could give the gain, the user has to have the wallet open 24/7 to take the interest, because the wallet acts as a peer. Securing the PoS and validate the transaction. CreditBit is built as a robust platform, with all its source code available on main repos on GitHub.\n\nCT: From which countries are users more interested in the project?\n\nPA: Most users are from Slovenia 30.24%, from USA 20.03%, from Russia 9,16%, from Norway 5,36%, from Germany 2,72%, from China 2,55%, from Greece 2,16%, from UK 2% and from Canada 1,5%.\n\nCT: How could the merchants implement CreditBit as a payment method?\n\nPA: CreditBit is merchant ready through CoinPayments platform. CoinPayments are offering plugins for all the popular web carts used today and merchants can easily start accepting CreditBit by using one of them.""]"
05/18/2016,"['Beneath the headlines, there’s arguably been the early stirrings of a sea change in the blockchain industry. There’s a new trough of disillusionment, but this time its those working with blockchain applications, not bitcoin, who are being affected.\n\nDescribed as the period in a hype cycle where interest wanes as experiments fail to deliver, the term was first used in the industry as bitcoin’s price declined in 2014 amid overinflated expectations about its use in e-commerce. Now, the innovators in the ecosystem seeking to apply blockchain technology for use by financial incumbents are showing the first signs of a similar frustrations.\n\nThe spinning of the tires on such attempts perhaps hasn’t been audible given that, while bitcoin’s problems were and still are largely public, the institutions experimenting with blockchain have done their best not publicize those struggles.\n\nStill, there has been a noticeable change in tone among those working close to such efforts.\n\nFor all the investment, it remains increasingly unclear exactly how banks will use blockchain technology or distributed ledgers, or if the areas where it seems most effective will be lucrative or interesting enough for incumbent financial firms to pursue.\n\nAs noted by Coin Sciences CEO Gideon Greenspan in a recent CoinDesk opinion piece, shared ledger efforts have hit a roadblock when it comes to confidentiality, as every institution operating in such environments today sees every transaction.\n\n""This turns out to be a huge issue, both in terms of regulation and the commercial realities of inter-bank competition,"" Greenspan writes. ""While various strategies are available or in-development for mitigating this problem, none can match the simplicity and efficiency of a centralized database managed by a trusted intermediary.""\n\nElsewhere, Matthew Spoke, one of the leaders of Deloitte’s Rubix project, an effort aimed at advancing the use of distributed protocols, wrote an opinion piece in which he hinted at the inherent ironies of how blockchain is being positioned as a complementary, cost-cutting technology for financial institutions.\n\nSpoke went so far as to question whether the blockchain industry’s softening of the comparably more alarmist rhetoric of bitcoin innovators properly represents the technology and its potential impact.\n\n""If it is still the case that the technology could pose an existential risk to some companies (which I would argue it is), then how can these same companies justify the focus and investment they are likely already putting into blockchain technology?"" Spoke asked.\n\nSuch public musings come at a time when rumors persist that some major financial institutions are cutting back on investments in blockchain tech, while members of R3CEV’s blockchain consortium allegedly publicly voice issues with the proposed funding the startup is requesting in order to move forward on its work.\n\nOutlook grows opaque\n\nThe idea that permissioned blockchain startups are now up against substantial challenges can be seen in the shifting strategies at startups R3 and Digital Asset Holdings.\n\nGreenspan noted that both are working less on distributed ledgers, and more on ""contract description languages"". The public language for Digital Asset’s new ""digital asset modeling language"" (DAML) backs up this assessment, with wording specifying that not all nodes on the network will process all updates to the ledger.\n\nR3 is taking similar action with its latest distributed ledger, Corda. But R3’s positioning of its platform may be the most notable, given the manner with which R3 chief architect Richard Gendal Brown took in its official announcement.\n\nFar from a victory lap, Brown’s statements can be read more aptly as an admission of how little ground has been made by big banks in applying blockchain to existing business problems. Brown went to great lengths in the post to laud bitcoin’s architecture in statements that color recent permissioned blockchain efforts as still striving to solve a ""business problem"" in the way that he argues the bitcoin blockchain already does.\n\nIn so many words, Brown positioned Corda on the basis that major financial institutions perhaps don’t need to use blockchains to exchange assets. Corda’s chief insight can be seen as the thesis that financial institutions today exchange contracts, and that a unique distributed ledger environment is needed to meet this need.\n\nOverall, Brown’s words imply that he believes that blockchain innovations have yet to be fully applied to a traditional finance context, and that this challenge has yet to be overcome.\n\nBitcoin’s dark days brighten\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, there seems to be the growing sentiment that bitcoin’s darkest and most contentious days may be behind it.\n\nIt’s no secret that the industry has taken its fair share of hits – major media mentions of bitcoin have declined amidst interest in permissioned blockchains and distributed ledger efforts at big banks. But, this time out of the spotlight may ultimately benefit bitcoin’s community.\n\nWith Segregated Witness, a plan to scale the bitcoin blockchain, moving forward and big bank blockchain projects hitting the aforementioned existential roadblocks, the path ahead for this community of innovators seems comparably brighter.\n\nAs shown by CoinDesk’s latest quarterly report, months of infighting among network developers seems to have done little to cause bitcoin’s price to decline or its rate of new wallet or ATM growth to decrease. Further, Bitcoin Core, its main development group, seems more coordinated than ever, even if they\'re operating more as the kind of unified entity they perhaps sought to avoid.\n\nGranted, the bitcoin community still needs to determine the best path forward on how development is governed.\n\nHowever, these issues appear more manageable in the face of issues at even established payments efforts like the W3C, where members are disillusioned by the outsized impact and influence of powerful stakeholders on the process of standardizing web payments.\n\nIn colloquial terms, the big bad wolves that have been howling outside of the house of bitcoin seem to be backing into the woods.\n\nRather than seen as a replacement for public blockchains, there’s a broader recognition that such technologies are best compared to “the Internet”, while permissioned efforts should be considered “Intranets”.\n\nWhile not yet widely embraced – prominent startup execs like Chain CEO Adam Ludwin have fought against the idea that the Internet analogy is relevant – it’s inarguable that the public Internet was more impactful than any closed system.\n\nThe proliferation of this argument could go a long way toward increasing understanding of the value of systems such as bitcoin and Ethereum, and create more public awareness of the benefits of a permissionless innovation platform for the delivery of financial services outside traditional mediums.\n\nThe very long tail of change\n\nWhat all this means for the path ahead is less clear.\n\nBut in pondering the question, I continue to go back to questioning the idea that technology is even capable of bringing about ""solutions"" to ""problems"". Based on the evidence, it would seem to be a somewhat misguided way to describe technology and what it achieves.\n\nI recently purchased a run of mid-1990s Wired magazines, the headlines of which could be just as relevant today. Of note was one cover that heralded how the Internet could come to challenge cable television, published in 1998. Nearly 20 years later, this process is only just starting to occur.\n\nOverall, the malaise on both sides of the industry can be seen as a symptom of the long tail of change the technology and underlying ideological movement are seeking.\n\nIf today really is 1993 in the lifespan of the second Internet, then banks might be best cast in the role of traditional media companies. In this light, it’s hard exactly to understand what major media companies could have gained from efforts to establish a consortium or even launching their own competitor to the Internet in a bid to deliver television.\n\nRather, as audiences migrated to a new platform, media companies simply adapted their services in a bid to extend their reach out of the idea that user preferences were simply changing with a new generation.\n\nIn turn, users of Internet platforms are simply leveraging this tech to obtain the same service at a lower cost, and with more convenient updates and delivery than entertainment outlets, which were central clearinghouses of such information, could ever have achieved.\n\nWhat we gain from this variety is less clear.\n\nOne would be hard-pressed to call Netflix, for example, a solution to anything. While it may have replaced going to the video rental store, as those who have spent time aimlessly flipping its offerings will attest, it’s hardly a ""solution"" to quality viewing.\n\nRather, it simply altered the reality and the experience, providing some benefits along with some new hassles. It’s hard to imagine bitcoin and blockchain won’t deliver similar results.\n\nBig bad wolf image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

With nearly $150m worth of the cryptocurrency ether raised to date, the unusual organization has inspired both passionate supporters and skeptics.\n\nIn the past week, numerous headlines and op-eds have emerged on the subject of The DAO, (distributed autonomous organization) with everyone from bloggers to social media outlets to major media publications weighing in. Opinions ranged from unblemished support to critical takes on the big questions surrounding the project.\n\nOverall, supporters of the project say The DAO ushers in a new mechanism for funding projects and individuals that might otherwise be ignored by the venture capital ecosystem. Further, they say it represents a radical method for reshaping the digital economy, while providing a powerful example of Ethereum\'s technology in action.\n\nCritics aren’t as convinced. While acknowledging its novelty, some have taken issue with several aspects of The DAO, including lingering questions about intellectual property rights, economic incentives and how existing regulations on securities and investment will come into play.\n\nThis feature looks at a slice of opinions on The DAO that, while by no means represents the totality of voices weighing in today, offers a a range of perspectives on the project.\n\nPositive points\n\nSome observers struck a far more optimistic tone in their assessment of the project since its launch, including investor and TechCrunch contributor Seth Bannon.\n\nIn an article entitled ""The Tao of \'The DAO\' or: How the autonomous corporation is already here"", Bannon reckoned that the concept could open the doors to more people to take part in what he called ""the innovation economy"".\n\n""By allowing economic cooperatives to be spun up with a line of code, and by allowing anyone on the Internet to become owners of these organizations, DAOs may allow more people than ever before to fully participate in and benefit from the innovation economy.""\n\nIn his piece, Bannon – who suggested the concept could one day evolve into a scenario in which Google-sized DAOs operate autonomously – echoed other observers, including critics of the concept, by highlighting its experimental and unpredictable future.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n""This is [a] new frontier, and the list of unknowns goes on. What does this mean for the future of corporations? The future of VC? While it could certainly be a profitable and successful endeavor itself, The DAO is in many ways a grand experiment in a new form of economic cooperation. Many of the unpredicted benefits and unexpected kinks will be discovered by this first pioneer.""\n\nBannon perhaps summed up the sentiments of what many are feeling about the project by saying, “It will sure be fun to watch.”\n\nSwedish Pirate Party founder and cryptocurrency supporter Rick Falkvinge wrote that criticisms about The DAO\'s leaderless nature are wrong, stating that those who make such claims are missing the point.\n\n""What the old world fails to see is that there is leadership, there is a business plan, and there’s a clear investment idea. It’s right in front of them. They just fail to recognize it as such: The source code,"" he wrote. ""The source code makes the decisions for all to see. The business plan is right in the source code.""\n\nFalkvinge went on to write:\n\n""The fact that Wall Street doesn’t recognize source code for perfectly valid, validatable, and transparent business logic is why Wall Street is being left behind.""\n\nHe argued that ""the exact same thing"" happened with bitcoin, pointing to the digital currency\'s early days as an example of the kinds of criticism being levied against The DAO.\n\nNegative notes\n\nOther observers took a more negative stance toward the project. Perhaps some of the most-discussed comments came from an essay by Dan Larimer, founder of BitShares and one of the originators of the concept of DAOs.\n\nIn a widely circulated piece, he argued that his experience with that project should be borne in mind as those backing The DAO await the end of the creation phase and the first funding proposals.\n\nLarimer argued that he believes problems will not surface in the immediate term, but that eventually The DAO participants will run up against issues of human nature itself.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n""It might not happen at first, but over time the Ethereum community will learn the hard way what the BitShares community has already discovered. Creating social systems to jointly fund development of projects and investments is challenging. Ultimately, technology can only aid in communication, it cannot fix the fundamental incompatibilities between individual self interest and community decision making.""\n\nAccording to Larimer, attempts within the BitShares community to effectively accomplish The DAO\'s mission, including raising funds and allocating vote-tokens to organization participants, ran into headwinds that he argued could crop up in the future.\n\nLow voting rates were one such issue.\n\n""One of the first things we learned from BitShares is that the vast majority (90%+) of stakeholders did not participate in voting,"" wrote Larimer. ""This is due to the fact that voting requires time, energy and skills that most investors lack. How many people have the economic, technical and entrepreneurial skills to vote responsibly?""\n\nLarimer also argued that the project could run into trouble in regards to concerns over the value of ETH, and what disbursing tokens to Contractors – entities that effectively work for The DAO via smart contracts – could do to the price in the short term. This issue, he said, created problems for BitShares community members that, ultimately, colored the process of voting on proposals for the worst.\n\n""Unable to bear the short-term paper loss and psychological impact of a lower market cap, people started electing proxies that would vote against all spending proposals,"" he wrote. ""With The DAO, the same principles are at work.""\n\nMixed feelings\n\nLastly, some commentators offered mixed criticism and praise, in at least one instance going on to propose suggestions in an attempt to help improve The DAO.\n\nSpeaking with Forbes contributor Laura Shin, Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer reckoned that the project ""is not operating within our existing legal framework"".\n\n""Some protections that are give[n] to investors that take the shape of 600 pages of regulations do not exist for distributed autonomous organizations, but on the other hand, DAOs have the benefits of algorithmic control and algorithmic restriction,"" he told the publication. ""For example, with the DAO, I can restrict how much the executive of a Kickstarter-like fund gets paid. I can simply say this is how much overhead they will get, and it is transparent and I can check it after the fact.”\n\nPreston Byrne, chief operating officer of blockchain startup Eris, offered his own take on the project. In his piece, Byrne compared the legal structure of a typical company with that of The DAO. He drew issue with the legal structure of the organization itself – a fact he argued would prove to be ""fatal"" for the project.\n\n""#THEDAO might look and feel like a company, but on cursory examination, too many gaps, too few formalities, not enough structure and legally incorrect methods reveal themselves as fatal to the exercise,"" he wrote.\n\nFar from calling for the abandonment of the project, Byrne reckoned that the project needs ""lawyering"", as well as what he believes to be two steps needed to put The DAO on a sustainable path.\n\n""Two things need to happen – quickly – to put this right (and these are just starting points),"" he wrote. ""The first is to get a formal structure involved. The second is to abandon the token sale and utilize legally compliant funding structures.""\n\nByrne continued:\n\n""Why address funding? Because the practice of selling blockchain tokens as an investment over the internet – as THEDAO is doing – while not new, is a big problem. Hundreds of cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitshares, Swarm, and Omni/Mastercoin, to name a few) have come and gone since 2013 which have used ""token sales,"" ""software licenses,"" ""crypto-equity,"" ""cryptofuel,"" or other artifices to raise funds from unaccredited investors. Unfortunately, this practice is against the law.""\n\nByrne reiterated his argument that The DAO would benefit from a more formal legal structure, effectively creating an ""automatic backbone to a bona fide, properly structured, equity crowdfunding business"".\n\n""It’s perhaps more boring when we do it that way. It takes more work. It takes much more time. It means not cutting corners,"" he wrote. ""But at the end of the day, not cutting corners is very much its own reward.""\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

I just donated 10000€ in bitcoin https://t.co/2ubZctplSy — Hack Back! (@GammaGroupPR) May 5, 2016\n\nIn an interview with Ars Technica, Fisher declined to give more details about which bank was targeted, alluding instead to much larger donations to come. Fisher said: “There’s hopefully a few orders of magnitude on the way.”\n\nFisher has previously claimed responsibility for attacking a controversial firm that sells spying tools to governments. Hacking Team was breached in 2015, exposing more than 400GB of highly sensitive data about clients and operations.\n\nFollowing the hack, Fisher published a “DIY Guide to Hacking” that outlined his reasons for targeting Hacking Team and instructions on how not to get caught.\n\n“Hacker culture was born in the U.S. as a counterculture, but that origin only remains in its aesthetics—the rest has been assimilated,” Phineas Phisher wrote in the guide. “At least they can wear a t-shirt, dye their hair blue, use their hacker names, and feel like rebels while they work for the Man.\n\n“You used to have to sneak into offices to leak documents. You used to need a gun to rob a bank. Now you can do both from bed with a laptop in your hand.”\n\nRojava Plan, the beneficiaries of Fisher’s donation were not available for comment. According to its campaign page, the money will go towards “feeding the revolution” after much needed imports were cut off as a result of the conflict with ISIS.\n\nReddit users called Fisher “a hero” for his actions and encouraged similar fund expropriation from banks to good causes.\n\n“Unfortunately, our world is backwards,” Phisher said in his hacking guide. “You get rich by doing bad things and go to jail for doing good.\n\n“Leaking documents, expropriating money from banks, and working to secure the computers of ordinary people is ethical hacking. However, most people that call themselves ‘ethical hackers’ just work to secure those who pay their high consulting fees, who are often those most deserving to be hacked.”', 'You can now buy Bitcoin at convenience stores all around Mexico, thanks to a partnership between Mexican cryptocurrency exchange Bitso and payment services provider Zmart Group.\n\nMexican Bitcoin exchange Bitcoin has begun selling Bitcoin through convenience stores.\n\nThe integration, which was announced via blog post on Bitso’s website, will be done through a partnership with Zmart Group’s MaxSaldo payment services. This will allow Mexicans to purchase Bitcoin at any of 29,000 supported locations at corner stores around the country.\n\nA boon for Bitcoin adoption in Mexico\n\nJosé Rodríguez, Bitso’s VP of Payments, sees this as a huge development for the adoption of cryptocurrency in Mexico.\n\nRodríguez says:\n\n“The Bitso team has worked hard to reach all potential users who would benefit from using Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Grupo Zmart through MaxSaldo has a vision to allow every corner store or ""tiendita"" to have payment and access to diverse services. We were interested in collaborating with them and their network in a unified vision to massify the use and advantages of Bitcoin.”\n\nPart of an increasing trend of cryptocurrency growth\n\nBitso added an Ethereum market to their exchange last month, the first ever MXN/ETH market. Trading volume on Bitso has seen a steady increase this year, and Rodríguez sees the addition of the MaxSaldo integration in corner stores as part of this greater trend of a rise in demand for Bitcoin in Mexico.\n\nRodríguez explains:', ""In a month of big news for the Bitcoin wallet, Mycelium has announced the integration of Glidera. Now, users can buy and sell bitcoin in the United States and Canada through the oldest wallet in the Bitcoin space besides the original Satoshi client.\n\n“We’re excited to join forces with the Mycelium team and bring this new service to Mycelium users,” said Dave Ripley, CEO of Glidera. “Mycelium offers one of the most secure and easy-to-use wallets on the market, and the addition of Glidera will further improve the experience for new and existing users.”\n\nGlidera does not hold customer funds at any time and will manage compliance, payment fraud management and liquidity challenges.\n\n“The Glidera integration reinforces the broader Mycelium vision of becoming the user’s hub for financial services,” said Nikolay Chichkanov, vice president of product for Mycelium. “We plan to continue investing in the Mycelium wallet, bringing more value to users.”\n\nThe news comes on the heels of major milestones for the Mycelium project. With less than a day left in its crowdsale, Mycelium has raised 2,145 bitcoins at approximately a $19 million valuation.\n\nThe company has been selling a 5 percent nondilutable stake in Mycelium since May 1, and it will continue until May 18. This stake will grant the owner rights to any future company growth, similar to a stock, but in the form of a Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR).\n\n“Like stocks,” Murashchik explains, “that grant you ownership of a company’s assets, and that the company can buy back from you in exchange for company cash you technically own, SARs grant you rights to a company's assets, but you can cash out on your own.”\n\nOne of the longest-standing Bitcoin companies is poised to become the first one to sell a stake directly on the blockchain.\n\nIn April Mycelium announced a new wallet, which will feature a range of products and integrations designed to simplify the use of blockchain assets. The company, which announced the new wallet on Reddit, expects to shortly integrate various API integrations for developers and business representatives.\n\nMycelium developers, burdened by fulfilling customer requests for no payment, made the choice to allow others to integrate services into the Mycelium wallet. Now people can run their businesses on the wallet.\n\nThe company started before Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin, first as a decentralized message transfer hardware. The firm switched to Bitcoin soon after it was released, “since Bitcoin is likewise a decentralized method of transferring messages,” according to Mycelium community manager Dmitry “Rassah” Murashchik. Mycelium says it now has more than 250,000 users.\n\n“We have very few serious competitors, and a huge time advantage over others, having already started on our new platform project, and already having developed business relationships with companies providing their services within our wallet,” Murashchik explains. “The business plan we are targeting ? an app platform connecting users to businesses ? has already been tested and proven to work. We have built our entire company on having a strong reputation, being open about our intentions and our activity, and plan to continue doing so in the future.”\n\nThe initial planning stages for the new direction were held back in August, and work started in October.\n\n“Unfortunately, our original plan of using Java for Android and RoboVM to emulate Java on iOS had a major setback, when Microsoft bought RoboVM and un-opensourced it,” Murashchik said. “That set us back probably a few months. However, just in time, React Native released support for Android, and we quickly switched to that. We considered React Native earlier, but with it only having support for iOS at the time, we dismissed it.”\n\nMycelium has thus far designed for its new project a functional demo wallet that works with testnet bitcoins, and is only now starting to build out the API and other functions. There has yet to be much precedent for a universal Bitcoin wallet. The overall idea, nevertheless, is fairly well-established and understood in the Bitcoin Community.\n\n“Just as you may have a bare Android OS that lets you expand its functionality by downloading more apps, while Google earns money on paid apps, we plan to have a bare wallet that lets you download plugins, while we earn money on the paid ones,” Murashchik explains.\n\nThe new Mycelium suite stands out because of its support for multiple digital currencies and blockchain-based assets. Thus, users will need only one wallet ? the Mycelium wallet ? to manage multiple digital assets. Mycelium says its customers have simply requested such a tool.\n\n“We are more interested in being able to store digital assets that either have some function, like Ethereum, Namecoin, Factom, Maidsafe and things like that, or that have real world backing, such as company stocks, fiat-backed tokens or digital registry of physical assets like deeds to property,” Murashchik told Bitcoin Magazine. “The new functionality will be agnostic to any kind of cryptoasset.”\n\nDevelopers will be able to use the API for Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum and other blockchain assets in what Mycelium calls a “Crypto-Swiss knife.” Mycelium also boasts bookkeeping, receivables, expenses, invoicing, social media and contacts to better manage one’s blockchain-related financial world.\n\nOther features dreamed of in the future include support for fiat accounts, remittances, virtual and physical debit cards, a personal finance manager, an investment platform, escrow accounts and digital asset creation and exchange functions.\n\nMycelium already offers a few third-party features. It consistently receives requests from other companies to add new features. This has, ultimately, cost Mycelium resources and money.\n\n“Every time we obliged,” Murashchik said, “meant that one or more of our developers would have to be set aside to do the coding themselves, costing us valuable time and resources. Frustratingly, it also kept distracting us from our core goals, which is to create the most up-to-date, functional and privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet.”\n\nThe team has struggled for years to find time to add support for CoinJoin and stealth addresses.\n\n“Eventually we just had enough,” he said, “and decided to make a wallet that would allow others to add their own features themselves, while leaving us to focus on just the things we believe are important. I was also concerned about feature creep in our current wallet, where all the things are very tightly integrated and difficult to manage, and looking at the example of the years it took for Core to be broken up from the nose, wallet and miner into its various components, wanted us to break our app into smaller modular sections while we still can. Setting ourselves up as a platform for cryptofinance to make money from connecting businesses to users was a nice benefit, too.”\n\n“Our current wallet is becoming a bloated monstrosity, where you have no choice but to download and use all of our third-party features,” Murashchik admits. “This makes it difficult to code, and makes security audits more complicated. A change in one feature could expose users to a security hole in another. Breaking the wallet into modules and adding plugin support will limit security audits to individual separate components, and will allow users to choose which functions they want and which they don't. Those who want a light, secure wallet that focuses on user privacy will have that option, and, likewise, those who want a feature-full wallet that lets them share their life and money with family and friends will have that option as well.”\n\nTo be sure, Mycelium is not looking for traditional investors: “We are just offering our users and other crypto-anarchists a way to both contribute to our new wallet, and receive a stake in our possible future growth.”\n\nUsers can register for the crowdsale on Mycelium’s website. The Mycelium tokens are sold as colored coins using the Colu platform. Participants purchase tokens in bitcoin, and receive upon the crowdsale’s end."", 'Educational institutions are turning their attention to the public blockchain to record and verify student credentials. Under normal circumstances, recording student achievements using paperwork can be labor-intensive and costly, making blockchain a significant step toward maximizing cheapness, security and transparency.\n\nHolberton School of software engineering, based in San Francisco, is now actively recording student achievements through blockchain. In October 2015, the institution announced its plans, making it the world’s first school to authenticate academic certificates in this way.\n\nAn example of what an academic certificate stored in the Bitcoin blockchain from Holberton School would look like can be seen on Merkle.io.\n\nAccording to HireRight, 86 percent of employers surveyed said that screening had exposed a candidate who had lied on his or her resume. Holberton School understands the struggles that companies face, which is one of the reasons it chose to store students’ academic records in the blockchain, Sylvain Kalache, co-founder of the school, told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n“For employers, it avoids having them spend valuable time checking candidates’ educational credentials by having to call universities or to pay a third party to do the job,” he said.\n\nAnd using the blockchain helps to save the school money by not having to build and operate its own database of records.\n\n“Because of the design of the blockchain’s distributed database, it cannot go down and cannot be altered, making the data always available and secure,” Kalache said. “It’d be a big responsibility if we were to build and maintain such an infrastructure. The blockchain does this free of charge.\n\n“Our students are very happy about the fact that their academic qualifications will be secure in the storage of the future,” Kalache said. “They also see how the industry is massively investing in the blockchain, and they are proud to be part of the school that was the first to use it.”\n\nThe University of Nicosia in Cyprus is also turning its attention to blockchain technology as a way of recording students’ achievements. Digital currency lecturer George Papageorgiou told Bitcoin Magazine that the use of the technology is becoming quite popular.\n\n“Students have been enthusiastic, knowing there’s an immutable trail of their prowess in the Bitcoin blockchain, which doesn’t compromise their privacy,” he said. “They or their future employers can use simple tools to verify the validity of their certificates themselves.”\n\nWith the first set of students graduating in June with an MSc in Digital Currency, Papageorgiou says they are helping other universities to incorporate blockchain technology.\n\n“We are working to improve the processes involved and expand this function to other university certificates as well as work with other universities desiring to build this functionality for their systems.”\n\nCatching On\n\n“The immutability of a public blockchain like Bitcoin’s and/or Ethereum’s could serve as a unifying structure for the proof-of-certificates globally,” Papageorgiou said. “If transactions are signed with a key known to belong to the university, anyone trying to verify a certificate can validate the whole process all the way back to the issuing institution.”\n\nConsidering the advantages of blockchain, Kalache said he doesn’t see why it shouldn’t catch on with other schools.\n\n“The only downside could be the challenge to interact with the technology itself, which can be pretty intimidating and complicated,” he said. “But guess what: The blockchain is becoming mainstream, and big players are entering the game.”\n\nKalache is talking about Holberton School mentor and IBM Vice President of Technology Jerry Cuomo, who believes that the blockchain will fundamentally change the way businesses are run after recently announcing the blockchain as a service so that any business can use it.\n\nSony also recently announced blockchain as a service to provide schools an easy way to share their academic certificates in the blockchain.\n\n“The technology has the potential to realize an entirely new infrastructure system for sharing records securely over the network in any number of ways, opening new doors of possibility for academic records and how they are assessed,” Sony Global Education said in a press release.\n\nPhoto Sylvain Kalache / Flickr(CC)', 'HolyTransaction CEO Francesco Simonetti talks to Cointelegraph about new opportunities opened to him by going into Bitcoin, and explains what is different about his wallet.\n\nSimonetti is a co-founder of AssoBit, Crypto College Network Italy and Bitcoin Foundation Italy. He says:\n\n“In 2013 I took off on my adventure in the Bitcoin ecosystem following the Bitcoin Meetup in Rome, I have always looked for exciting opportunities. Very early in my life, I promoted and organized electronic music events. Later, I conducted multiple projects producing music. I began to have an interest in cryptocurrencies and started HolyTransaction because it strengthens the underprivileged in a quick, safe and independent way’.\n\nA multicurrency wallet\n\nHolyTransaction is a universal wallet which allows users to store, spend, change and manage multiple cryptocurrenties and digital values \u200b\u200bas Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Omni Layer, Dash, Peercoin, Blackcoin, Ethereum, Gridcoin and more. Basically all the currencies based on the blockchain technology.\n\nThe peer-to-peer method enables simple and fast transactions, and enables crypto-to-crypto instant exchanges in a single account.\n\nFighting competitors\n\nThe main difference between HolyTransaction and its competitors is that the first one admits not only Bitcoin but also many other cryptocurrencies, so it can be called a “universal” wallet. Additionally, HolyTransaction has a fixed-rate exchange.\n\nUsers can switch from one to another cryptocurrencies in their personal account in a few clicks, with a simple interface.\n\nNormally, if you want to have ten different cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, peercoin, etc.) you need to have ten different wallets, which is difficult to manage. Instead, HolyTransaction platform solves this problem, unifying everything in a single account. It also provides you with a high level of security with crypto-to-crypto exchanges so you can easily turn from one cryptocurrency to another.\n\nAdding Multisignature for improving security\n\nBitcoin users are quite concerned about their privacy. However, there are several ways that the accounts are protected: for example, regular safety inspections and 2-factor authentication: the first is the user name and password, and the second is the verification code you receive on your mobile.\n\nMoreover, HolyTransaction used the so-called “hot & cold storage backups”, but they also decided to incorporate the MultiSignature (MultiSig) to improve the wallet security. MultiSignature gives users multiple access:: a cryptocurrencies wallet has a public key, which is shared; and a private one, which is kept secret.\n\nTransactions must be signed with the private key of the user to verify his authorship, and to validate the transaction.\n\nMultiSig requires more than one person to complete a transaction agreement. For example, a wallet Multisignature from seven users may need the validation of three of its members for the transaction. Or if two people open up a MultiSig wallet together (friends, partners etc), this wallet may only send transactions when two people have validated such a move. If not, the transaction cannot perform.\n\nIn fact, HolyTransaction wants to let people manage their money as they wish.\n\n“Bitcoin exists for that: to allow yourself be your own bank. By incorporating MultiSignature on our platform, we are trying to strengthen the autonomy of people with the right to fully control your money”, explained Francesco Simonetti.\n\nFragmentation problem\n\nThere are over 500 cryptocurrencies out there and each one requires a download of a custom software to use it. The greatest part of wallet software is too technical for users, and lack certain essential security measures.\n\nFor the amount of existing cryptovalues, there was almost no wallet able to cover them at the same time. Each community is trying to reinvent the wheel.\n\nSo HolyTransaction wanted to solve this problem:\n\n“It became clear that there was a need for universal wallets which would admit many different currencies, for non-technical customers. So we solve the problem of fragmentation through this wallet”, said Simonetti.\n\nAn add-on to know the exchange rates\n\nRecently HolyTransaction added the possibility to download an add-on for the Firefox browser.\n\nYou can read the exchange rates of the most popular currencies only with a couple of clicks. It is very simple and useful, as it gives you all the information you need before buying or selling your favorite cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe original article was written by Bettina Lubelle on Cointelegraph Espana.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Murder ranges between $5,000 and $200,000; making the death look like an accident is an additional $4,000; just beating them up is $500; and setting their car on fire will set you back $1,000.\n\nAnyone who wants to become a hitman can register on the site too, and needs to specify how they can kill people—with a pistol or sniper rifle, for example—and whether they have military training.\n\nScreenshot of the site\n\nThe point of the site is, of course, to get people to hand over their bitcoins. The messages show the admin stringing along a wealth of customers, taking funds while making excuse after excuse for no murder or action actually taking place.\n\n""These guys have made at least 50 bitcoins [nearly $23,000] on this,"" said Chris Monteiro, an independent researcher who has been following the site. Along with a partner, he has also hacked into Besa Mafia and is still collecting messages. Monteiro said he wasn\'t behind the dump of messages and other site data.\n\nIn one message from the dump, the admin writes that the site not only cheats people out of their bitcoin; it also provides information to law enforcement about ordered hits.\n\n""This website is to scam criminals of their money. We report them for 2 reasons: to stop murder, this is moral and right; to avoid being charged with conspiracy to murder or association to murder, if we get caught,"" the admin writes.\n\nThe Besa Mafia brand is not just isolated to its own site. It has proliferated across the web, with reviews for its hitmen, calls for arms to push back against the site, and Besa Mafia\'s admins even intimidating those sceptical of the site.\n\nScreenshot of the site\n\n\n\nOn April 17, someone edited the Wikipedia page for ""Albanian mafia,"" and added ""Albanian Mafia are managing a controversed [sic] site on Deep Web where they take orders from general public for body harm services such as beating up, setting cars on fire, kiling, etc.""\n\nOf course, anyone could have authored that Wikipedia edit, including Besa Mafia\'s admins. The same goes for the glaringly positive reviews of the site, scattered across the internet.\n\nOne review posted on personal blog and supposedly written by a happy customer, includes a gory picture of a man covered in blood and slumped in a driver\'s seat. In 800 words, the customer explains in rambling detail how Besa Mafia helped him kill the man who raped his girlfriend.\n\n""I saw they also have hitmen who do murder for hire, and I was astonished to see that the price was very low: only $5,000,"" the customer writes. Another customer writes how they were struck in a hit and run and hired the Besa Mafia to burn the culprit\'s car.\n\nBesa Mafia also offered a referral campaign, meaning that anyone who shared a link and successfully got others to sign up would earn a 10 percent commission.\n\nSome sites were even looking for people to fight back against the group.\n\n""To be honest, I was intimidated""\n\n\n\n""They are online since some time and they have no complaints, so please don\'t be lazy and say they are a scam, it\'s good to discourage people saying they are scam but is better to say the truth that they are real and that we need to do what we can to shut them off,"" a post from Texas on classified ad site Reachoo reads.\n\nFor something that was supposedly written by a critic, the ad laid out Besa Mafia\'s services in great detail.\n\nOthers have, understandably, voiced skepticism about the site. Monteiro called out the site as a clear fake back in February. He was then contacted by an administrator of Besa Mafia. ""Would it be possible for us to pay for a true and honest positive review?"" the admin wrote, according to Monteiro.\n\nAnother person who posted negative comments about Besa Mafia and asked to remain anonymous told me he was paid $50 in bitcoin after removing his own content.\n\nBut Monteiro didn\'t budge. Shortly after, the admin sent him a video of hooded figures torching a car, with Monteiro\'s blog URL typed out on a piece of paper. This also happened to others who posted negative comments about Besa Mafia; at least three videos were made, showing burning vehicles, all with messages to those who had spoken ill of the group.\n\nA GIF of one of the videos meant to intimidate critics of the site\n\n\n\n""To be honest, I was intimidated,"" Monteiro said in a phone call.\n\nBut the recently hacked data sheds some light on these antics, and it appears that they may have been fabricated as part of the convoluted plan to make Besa Mafia seem more legitimate.\n\nAccording to hacked messages, the people burning these cars were prospective ""hitmen"" who had hoped to become employed on the site.\n\n""For now, we can use your help to set cars on fire,"" the admin told one supposed applicant, and in another message laid out specific instructions for filming the video: Take a normal car, not too cheap or expensive, to the outskirts of a city, write the Besa Mafia URL on a piece of paper, light the car on fire, move back around 10 metres, and show the paper again.\n\nTo check the legitimacy of the hacked data, I attempted to send messages to users in the dump using Besa Mafia\'s built-in messaging system. Out of 22 messages, only 5 delivered successfully, implying that either those accounts have since been deleted, or perhaps didn\'t exist in the first place. None of the supposed customers or hitmen on the site responded to my emails, and some of the email addresses were fake. I wasn\'t able to confirm the veracity of all of the messages included in the dump, but some contained details of bitcoin transactions that matched those recorded on the blockchain.\n\nFor their part, the person or persons behind the Besa Mafia admin account said in a message to me that the hacked data was itself fake.\n\n""Someone managed to steal the password of one of our members providing services, and he got a list of customers posting jobs; and from there he invented and wrote up many fictious [sic] messages between admins and users,"" they wrote.\n\nThe admin said they would no longer pay people to remove negative reviews, but instead, ""we will burn out their cars and homes; doing so we will prove to them that we are legit and that they sould [sic] remove their comments or we will burn more.""\n\n***\n\nThe multi-faceted and intricate nature of this scam—from getting people to burn cars to paying critics to shut up—is unlike anything I\'ve seen so far on the dark web. Perhaps more worrying is that there seems to actually be a demand for this sort of site, judging by the reams of apparent messages and orders.\n\nAs the person who was paid to remove his negative comments told me, ""it only takes a single idiot to fall for this to make all of this shit worth it.""', 'In case you haven’t heard, blockchain is all the rage lately on Wall Street, whereas bitcoin, the digital currency that blockchain came along with in 2009, is suddenly very uncool.\n\nBlockchain, by the way, is the decentralized, peer-to-peer, open-source, distributed ledger technology that underlies bitcoin. (Check out our video explainer on blockchain.) The bitcoin blockchain is just one use case of the technology; lately the idea of utilizing the same technology, apart from cryptocurrency, has become popular. As Bloomberg’s Matt Levine wrote earlier this month, “If you are any sort of self-respecting financial or finance-adjacent professional these days, you had better be inserting the word ‘blockchain’ into random sentences to prove that you\'re up to speed.”\n\nIndeed, banks and financial services have certainly hopped aboard the blockchain train. But behind public press releases about initiatives and blockchain experimentation, executives at these companies differ greatly in their thinking on the technology and their faith in it.\n\nFather-and-son team Don and Alex Tapscott, both business strategy consultants, have a new book out today called “Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World.” A more apt title might hedge that the technology “could” change the world, but the book makes a convincing case for why blockchains might revolutionize the financial sector. (And and many other sectors, but for now, the excitement is starting with finance.) For their research, the Tapscotts spoke to numerous people in banking.\n\n\n\nAlex Tapscott says people in banking fall into four categories right now in their attitudes about blockchain. It’s worth including here his full explanation, as told to Yahoo Finance:\n\n“There are still a few who are generally afraid of this or don’t fully buy into it, but are trying to learn more. That’s increasingly a minority. More people these days fall into a second category, which is they see this as an opportunity to reduce cost in their existing business. That’s interesting. But for us, the bigger opportunity, and I think increasingly more financial services firms fit into this, is to say, How can we use this new technology platform to fundamentally reinvent our business? If billions of people in the world don’t have access to financial services, maybe we can be the ones to harness this new technology to offer them the same services we offer our existing clients. Now, there’s a fourth category of course: if you’re a bank that thinks this is all nonsense, I would highly recommend you at least upgrade to fearful. Because this change is happening.”\n\nWell, blockchain believers may say the change is happening. And there are signs that is the case. To cite just two examples: More than 45 banks have signed on to blockchain consortium R3 CEV, including Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM), and Bank of America (BAC), to test out blockchain tech for their transaction-settling processes; and blockchain startup Chain recently announced it had completed a blockchain-for-banking product and revealed Citi (C), Visa (V), and other heavy-hitters as launch partners.\n\nBut bitcoin believers (and yes, there are still many) say that the concept of closed, permissioned blockchains, without digital currency, doesn’t make much sense. At most, bitcoin executives say, it can improve back-office I.T. functions of banks, which is a rather unsexy proposition for a technology that can do much more. Some are hopeful that blockchains can eventually deliver a decentralized form of all kinds of technology platforms, including, say, Uber. “It’s the disruptors themselves that stand to be disrupted,” Alex Tapscott says, describing the possibility of a ""super Uber"" that cuts out the middleman operator.\n\n\n\nAs Don Tapscott explains, banks should be thinking bigger than they are. They ought to be aiming to revamp their systems entirely, rather than simply to improve efficiencies and reduce costs. “The blockchain is the biggest innovation in computer science in a generation, we think,"" he says. ""And what it represents is the Internet of value. We’ve had the Internet of information for several decades. But when it comes to exchanging value—not just money, but music or loyalty points or stocks or bonds—you can’t do that in a peer-to-peer way without a powerful intermediary. This has resulted in a situation where powerful intermediaries are capturing all the value of the digital age.""']"
05/19/2016,"['Ethereum is having a moment.\n\nCoinbase, a bitcoin-only exchange, is planning to add support for ethereum, the company said today (May 19). Coinbase exchange users will be able to buy and sell ether, the virtual currency unit behind ethereum starting Tuesday, May 24. Ether is currently trading at about $14 USD (bitcoin is trading at around $448 USD). Sources say Coinbase had been considering adding ethereum for some time. Earlier today, a screenshot of a support page for ether was published by a cryptocurrency trader on Twitter, then appeared on social media site Reddit.\n\nEthereum is a digital currency similar to bitcoin. Such currencies, based on software, allow people to transact anonymously and freely without a middleman involved.\n\nCreated by 22-year-old software developer Vitalik Buterin, ethereum has a particular property that’s excited companies: smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially agreements between two parties that can execute automatically, without human involvement. Unlike bitcoin, ethereum natively supports smart contracts. Proponents say smart contracts can cut costs and reduce human error. They have gained support from JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, and even the state of Delaware.\n\nIBM has explored using Ethereum to help Internet of Things devices interact with each other. Microsoft added support for ethereum to Azure, its cloud computing platform for developers. Marley Gray, director of business development for blockchain at Microsoft, said that the tech giant has added over 40 different partners for Azure platform, 40% of which are based on Ethereum. Earlier this month, the New York Department of Financial Services approved Gemini, a virtual currency exchange founded by the Winklevoss brothers, to start trading ether.\n\nCoinbase hasn’t yet gotten regulatory approval in general in New York, so Coinbase users in New York won’t be able to trade ethereum. The company expects to make ethereum and new products available to New York users once its bitlicense is approved. New York State residents can use the Coinbase exchange and the virtual currency wallet.\n\nCoinbase’s support is a vote of confidence for ethereum. The startup has raised $106 million in four funding rounds from investors such as Andressen Horowitz, BBVA Ventures, and the New York Stock Exchange. Adding ethereum will not only help the virtual currency, but could generate more trading on Coinbase’s exchange.', ""The hacker behind the notorious breaches of Hacking Team embarked on a humanitarian project to assist a crowdfunding campaign supporting the Rojava region in northern Syria.\n\nPhineas Fisher, the hacker behind the notorious breaches of Hacking Team and Gamma International, has embarked on a humanitarian project to assist a crowdfunding campaign supporting the Rojava region in northern Syria that opposes IS/Daesh. The generous donation, however, was made using stolen Bitcoin.\n\nThe hacker tweeted, “Rojava is one of the most inspiring revolutionary projects in the world today. I just donated 10000€ in bitcoin”. The Robin Hood-styled donation comes a month after the hacker published a how-to tutorial on PastBin that demonstrated his method used in breaching zero day seller Hacking Team.\n\nAlso known as “Hack Back!” and “GammaGroupPR”, the hacker said he may donate another million in stolen Bitcoin, according to an Ars Technica report. He previously used the pseudonyms “FinFisher.”\n\nPhineas Fisher did not identify the victimized individuals or institutions that were robbed to obtain the funds. The hacker told Ars he would prefer not to identify the victims “since there's hopefully a few orders of magnitude more on the way.”"", 'Illustration: Donald Iain Smith/Getty Images\n\nIn 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto—whoever he or she really is—used a new invention, called the blockchain, to run currency maintenance and payment software over a decentralized, global computer network. What we got was Bitcoin, an unstoppable digital currency. We now know that a blockchain, in its generalized form, can also be used to run any other kind of software imaginable. Once deployed on a blockchain, programs run automatically, they are accessible to anyone with an Internet connection, and they are nearly impervious to governmental controls. Which is to say, they are essentially autonomous. If the word Skynet just floated through your mind, then you’re starting to get the picture. (See “The Future of the Web Looks A Lot Like Bitcoin.” And watch this explainer of how the blockchain works.)\n\nEthereum is one of the projects bringing this technology to the masses. It provides a user-friendly platform for deploying software onto a blockchain network. Vlad Zamfir has been working on refining the protocols that will ensure that the Ethereum network can be scaled up. Most of the people developing similar systems speak with unqualified exhilaration about blockchain technology’s disruptive \xadpotential: They tout censor-proof social media tools, automated microlending apps, and government-independent identity verification, to name just a few examples. But, in his moments of greatest doubt, Zamfir finds the resulting loss of societal control terrifying. He spoke with IEEE Spectrum about the darker potential of public blockchains, what can be done to keep the technology an engine for social good, and why he still thinks the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nIEEE Spectrum: The goal, I take it, is to make something that anyone can easily build upon. Of course, that puts a lot of power into the hands of people with both good and bad intentions. What kinds of bad things do you think we are likely to see?\n\nPhoto: Vlad Zamfir\n\nVlad Zamfir: Some of the things that come to mind immediately are things like hate speech, defamation, things that we deal with through censorship. There’s also a big privacy issue with blockchains. It’s not that you can’t use it anonymously. It’s that someone could use it to make an application that’s specifically designed to infringe your privacy, to make breaches into…databases of private information.\n\nWith autonomous software it will be much harder for society to regulate and to stop these kinds of things. Right now, it would be quite hard for me to host a server that stores a lot of people’s personal data and serve it out illegally. It would be a challenge, right? Whereas in the world that we’re trying to build it would not be a challenge. I get the data once. I publish it once. And then I leave. It’ll be served out by this network forever.\n\nI worry about that a lot. I think that censoring hate speech is actually a good thing. I think that not having libel be publishable is a good thing. I think there’s a reason that society asks people to take it down.\n\nA lot of this stuff at the moment is still a little bit sci-fi because we don’t have blockchain scaling yet. We don’t have privacy on the blockchain. But we’re working on this stuff very hard.\n\nThe more I make progress on them, the more scared I get.\n\nSpectrum: What about the people with good intentions? Is it just the bad actors we should worry about, or is there also the potential for unintended negative consequences?\n\nV.Z.: Actually, the thing that’s really terrifying is the way policymakers might want to use this technology. It could potentially be very, very risky.\n\nImagine if some government somewhere decided, from now on here is the title system where property is transferred. That’s actually a very dangerous thing to do because you’ve specified the title system in an algorithm that has no ability to respond to court orders outside of what is specified in the algorithm.\n\nAs a policy tool, the blockchain provides something that is very reliable, and will execute exactly the way you specified it. But it is also potentially autonomous, which means that it can survive your government. And it also means that your people might be stuck with it.\n\nEvery week now, you hear some big-shot regulator say how blockchains might be the future of technology that they use. And it’s kind of frightening.\n\nSpectrum: Do other developers in the community share your concern?\n\nV.Z.: Generally, people don’t feel responsible. There’s a lot of feeling that we’re just producing general-purpose tools and it’s not up to us what people do with them.\n\nIt is a justification that people in practice are quite happy with. But I don’t think it’s a very serious position to take from an ethical standpoint.\n\nSpectrum: You’ve said in the past that Ethereum is designed to be hard to control and that there is little to nothing that can be done on the protocol level to ensure that people use it only to build good things. What then do you want people to do?\n\nV.Z.: Actually, just by having the conversations it improves people’s ability to pay attention to the fact that some of these applications might actually be unethical. Just for developers to understand that their choices are…not just neutral, I think will make a huge difference.\n\nSpectrum: Given that you foresee so many negative outcomes, how do you justify the work you do?\n\nV.Z.: We need more than just—hey, let’s make money; hey, this is really interesting; or hey, here’s a good use case. I think if you’re going to bring autonomous software to the world you have to have a damn good justification. You have to say why, actually, if we don’t have this we’re definitely going to have a really bad outcome.\n\nSpectrum: Okay, so then why is it necessary? What does the world look like if we just keep going on without this kind of technology?\n\nV.Z.: I think that basically there’s a crazy amount of corruption and failure over existing legal and regulatory frameworks. And given the nature of the global problems that we’re facing, we need some framework that we can use on a global basis to coordinate.\n\nThe reason [traditional governance] hasn’t worked out that well is that people end up gaming the systems for their own advantage. And the reason why this might be different is because it’s a tool…that we explicitly can’t control. It’s a tool that we put outside of our jurisdiction in order to have it govern us. That is a hard-core thing we have never done before. Society has never created something that is not human in order to govern society.\n\nVideo: Morgen E. Peck and IEEE Spectrum Staff\n\nThis article appears in the June 2016 print issue as “The Blockchain Has a Dark Side.”', 'Earlier in May, Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright made headlines with the claim that he was in fact the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, known as “Satoshi Nakamoto.” While Wright has yet to offer concrete public evidence to back up his claim, some in the Bitcoin community have insisted that even if Wright is Nakamoto, it doesn’t matter.\n\nThis is a classic engineer’s fallacy. I say this with love—I’m an engineer myself—but it exemplifies a blinkered worldview which is both wrong and dangerous. The identity of the Bitcoin creator matters because if he or she were to come forward, they might have a real shot at finally uniting a fractious community. At the very least, the creator could provide some clarity on a host of unresolved, fundamental questions that are damaging Bitcoin’s credibility with investors and potential users alike.\n\nThe network is not the project is not the network\n\nIt is true that Satoshi’s true identity is irrelevant to the Bitcoin network. The network was (brilliantly) designed so that its transactions require no trust or central authority. This will remain true as long as no entity controls too much of the “mining” computational power—more than one quintillion computations per second—that secures Bitcoin’s revolutionary blockchain. More than the sum of its code, the Bitcoin project has been divided by bitter disagreements. (Blockchain, for the uninitiated, is a digital platform that verifies and creates a permanent record of online transactions.) Nakamoto is believed to control 7% of all extant bitcoin, worth roughly $450 million today. That’s enough to influence Bitcoin’s spot price, but not enough to control it.\n\nBut the Bitcoin network is a living, changing thing, composed of constantly evolving software. More than the sum of its code, the ongoing Bitcoin project has been divided by very public, bitter disagreements. These have at best slowed progress, and at worst dragged Bitcoin into something like a civil war.\n\nHow Bitcoin is governed\n\nFinal decisions regarding what software runs on the Bitcoin network are made by Bitcoin’s miners. Armed with cheap electricity and custom hardware, miners secure the blockchain and are rewarded with newly minted bitcoin. But miners do not (currently) develop new Bitcoin software; they merely choose what to adopt.\n\nThis can be a fraught process. If different miners run fundamentally incompatible versions of the Bitcoin software—a situation known as a “hard fork”—then the blockchain will split in two. In theory the chain supported by the most mining power will ultimately be triumphant, but the outcome could be quite costly for those who choose the wrong side or fail to upgrade quickly.\n\nBitcoin software is open source. Anyone can copy it, build on it, or release their own version. (Most “altcoins,” such as Litecoin and Dogecoin, adapt the Bitcoin code.) But in practice, for seven years, Bitcoin software was built by a small, tight-knit group of engineers—including Satoshi Nakamoto, until 2010, when he/she/they retired and vanished—whose code was universally accepted by miners. Then came 2015.\n\nA brief and civil war\n\nLast year, the increasing popularity of the Bitcoin network began to threaten its capacity limit of roughly 7 transactions per second, and Bitcoin’s engineers fragmented into factions. One group, now known as Bitcoin Classic, wanted to immediately promote a hard fork that would double the bandwidth of the Bitcoin network. Another faction, Bitcoin Core, believed that this was too risky, and promoted a different short-term solution to the looming capacity crisis.\n\nAs it turned out, however, the scuffle over capacity was only a symptom of a larger debate. To oversimplify: Bitcoin Classic and its backers believe the Bitcoin network should quickly scale to handle the same volume of transactions as mainstream platforms like Visa, regardless of the consequences. Bitcoin Core believes that Bitcoin should remain maximally decentralized and trustless, while new, more scalable solutions are developed that can handle millions of transactions per second. These solutions would be separate networks that use Bitcoin only sporadically, to settle large numbers of small transactions all at once. As it turned out, however, the scuffle over capacity was only a symptom of a larger debate.\n\nThe argument was vitriolic and often very personal. Accusations of conflict of interest were flung around on Reddit like confetti. Several Bitcoin Core members are cofounders of the startup Blockstream, which has raised more than $70 million in pursuit of its vision of Bitcoin’s future. The CEO of the equally well-funded startup Coinbase threw his weight behind the hard fork strategy espoused by the Bitcoin Classic factions. One well-known developer publicly abandoned the project entirely, claiming “it has failed because the community has failed.”\n\nIn the end, the miners chose Bitcoin Core’s solution rather than risk a hard fork—at least for now. But it seems unlikely that the debate has entirely ended, and its consequences were decidedly negative. Venture capitalists and tech media who once trumpeted Bitcoin as the Next Big Thing now seem far more skeptical. Data from Y Combinator indicates that the incidence of Bitcoin-related startups has plummeted over the last year. In some ways, everybody lost.\n\nIt cannot be measured, and yet it exists\n\nThis will not be the last Bitcoin battle, or the last stain on its public image. But the public perception of Bitcoin would certainly take another hit if, for instance, Nakamoto is revealed as Wright, whose public behavior has been inconsistent and confusing. Public perception filters into industry perception, and the attitudes held by venture capitalists and entrepreneurs alike. Simply put, the identity of the Bitcoin creator matters.\n\nNakamoto’s secret identity has in some ways been very helpful to the Bitcoin project. Its mystery is alluring, and for those who dig deeper, the elegant brilliance of Nakamoto’s code and prose continue to inspire by example. But in the current environment, mystery may not be as helpful as clarity. If he/she/they were to reveal themselves, they could help resolve disputes before they become civil wars. As Mark Zuckerberg, who knows a thing or two about the merits of the iconic founder, says:\n\nThe social capital and moral authority that comes from being the founder and having built many of the company’s key products means that on balance people trust you more and give you the benefit of the doubt more when you make tough calls. Fewer people complain and take your time to manage. Fewer people quit and slow your execution. Everything is easier with social capital.\n\nBitcoin is an open-source project, not a company, but the same truth applies. The engineer’s fallacy is to assume that things that cannot be measured do not matter. Social capital is hard to measure, but it is extremely powerful. The attitude that technical projects are somehow beyond such human considerations is common, wrong, and dangerous. In the end, if Bitcoin ultimately fails to achieve its potential, it will be because of human failures, not technical ones.\n\nFollow Jon on Twitter at @rezendi. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.', 'For many people involved with Bitcoin, altcoins are nothing more than testnets. Hundreds of digital currencies are currently listed on CoinCap.io, but Bitcoin still dominates 78 percent of the market. In total, there are only 10 digital currencies with a current market cap of $10 million or more.\n\nWhen looking at the most popular altcoins, it’s easy to see that there are some cryptocurrency features that are more desirable than others. Many have said that any altcoin with useful features will eventually see those features incorporated into Bitcoin. Up to this point, it’s clear that many of the most popular altcoins contain features that are similar to new improvements that are planned for Bitcoin.\n\nIt should be noted that Ripple will not be included in this list as it fits the archetype of a permissioned ledger more than an open, permissionless blockchain.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is the most successful altcoin in the history of digital currency ? at least when measured as a percentage of Bitcoin’s overall market cap. It was the second altcoin to ever reach a $1 billion market cap (after Litecoin).\n\nThe main selling point of Ethereum is that it is a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. These sorts of applications have long been talked about as a sort of “Bitcoin 2.0.”\n\nBitcoin Alternatives: There are a variety of ways in which Ethereum-esque applications could make their way to Bitcoin:\n\nIt should be noted that the use of Bitcoin on Ethereum was also recently enabled via BTC Relay.\n\nDogecoin and Litecoin\n\nDogecoin and Litecoin are two different digital currencies that are mostly used for low-value, low-security transactions. According to CoinGecko, these are the two most popular altcoins besides Ethereum. Although the Litecoin market cap was once over $1 billion, it currently sits below $200 million.\n\nBitcoin Alternatives: Sidechains and layer-2 protocols, such as the Lightning Network, are Bitcoin’s main alternatives to Dogecoin and Litecoin ? at least in terms of low-security, cheap alternatives to the Bitcoin blockchain. Of course, it should be noted that there may not be much of a security tradeoff in the case of the Lightning Network. These are still Bitcoin transactions.\n\nBlockstream CTO Greg Maxwell and Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik recently shared countering viewpoints (here for Maxwell and here for Garzik) on which solution will work best for Bitcoin. It would be impossible for Bitcoin to replace Litecoin as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” but this is more of a marketing term than anything involving an actual use case.\n\nDash and Monero\n\nAlthough they have different communities and features, the main selling point for both Dash and Monero is better privacy. Dash is currently the more popular altcoin on the market, although Bitcoin Core contributor and security researcher Peter Todd has publicly noted his preference for Monero. These two altcoins could face increased competition from the upcoming launch of Zcash.\n\nBitcoin Alternatives: Better privacy has been a topic of conversation in the Bitcoin community for a long time. Implementing CoinJoin in Bitcoin Core has been discussed on the GitHub repository since 2013, although the conversation has gained new life in recent months ? in large part thanks to JoinMarket.\n\nConfidential Transactions is a proposal that would greatly improve the level of privacy in Bitcoin transactions by encrypting the amounts involved.\n\nIt’s possible that something like Confidential Transactions could be tested on a sidechain before being implemented on the main Bitcoin blockchain. This feature is already available on Blockstream’s Elements Alpha testnet sidechain. Some members of the Blockstream team have also expressed their excitement regarding the prospect of a zerocash sidechain.\n\nPlenty of Work Still to Be Done\n\nAlthough it appears many of the most popular features of altcoins will eventually find their way into Bitcoin, it’s important to remember that these are still very much works-in-progress. Segregated Witness, which is currently being tested and reviewed in the form of a pull request to Bitcoin Core, is a big step forward for these sorts of changes, and BIP 9 (Version Bits) should also be helpful as a new method of deployment for soft forks.\n\nSidechains could be another major step forward ? eventually. The discussion as to how this functionality will be added to Bitcoin was recently started on the Bitcoin development mailing list by Sztorc. Rootstock plans to launch via a federated peg model at first, and it’s still unclear exactly when a decentralized, 2-way peg will be possible with Bitcoin.\n\nGreg Maxwell recently provided an update on the current status on sidechains from Blockstream’s perspective.', ""Pichai’s big statistic is performance per watt—that’s where Google is saying the TPU is an “order of magnitude” better\n\nASIC designers customize the size and arrangement of the chip’s transistors to closely match the kind of computations needed. Norm Jouppi, a hardware engineer at Google who wrote the TPU blog post, says that the chip was designed to have fewer transistors per operation, because machine learning requires less precise computations.\n\nBut Pichai’s speech and the accompanying blog post only reveal a few details about TPUs. About the only useful thing we know about the chip is that it’s an ASIC, or application-specific integrated circuit. ASIC chips aren’t bought off the shelves, but designed specifically to do one task very well without using a lot of power. They’re used in applications that never change, like the controlling how a phone battery charges.\n\nYesterday at Google’s I/O developers conference , CEO Sundar Pichai briefly spoke about a custom-built chip that helps give Google its edge in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The chip, dubbed a TPU or Tensor Processing Unit (in keeping with Google's A.I. platform TensorFlow ), is specifically wrought for running Google’s decision-making algorithms. Most companies like Facebook and Microsoft use GPUs for their machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nWithout seeing objective benchmarks on the TPUs, we should be skeptical of Google's claims.\n\nIt’s entirely possible that the TPU chips are simply performing at slightly better speeds, but consuming significantly less power. ASIC chips are extremely power efficient, which is one of the main reasons a recent surge of interest in ASIC chips has been in Bitcoin mining. Mining, like machine learning, requires a computer to quickly perform a large amount of computations and has also typically relied on GPUs.\n\nIn the Bitcoin world, an ASIC-based mining rig can consume twenty times less power while doing the same work as a GPU-based rig, as broken down on this Bitcoin forum. In this example, six AMD R9 290 graphics cards (which pull an average of 250 watts each, plus computer components), are stacked against 78 DualMiner ASIC cards (which run off USB and pull 2.5 watts each). Both setups are rated to run the same computations (5.4 Mh/s), but the GPU-based rig conservatively pulls more than 1500 watts while the ASIC rig pulls less than 200 watts.\n\nBasically, the takeaway is that statistics can be misleading, and without seeing objective benchmarks on the TPUs, we should be skeptical of these claims.\n\nASIC chips have been made since around since the 1960s, and also have some noted downsides. For instance, ASIC chips are designed to run certain code a very specific way. If the machine learning architecture at Google changes, the TPUs could be rendered useless. This is unlikely, as Google uses their Tensorflow platform for everything, but still a possibility.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Google has been using TPUs since April 2015 to speed up how fast Street View reads signs, and Pichai mentioned in his speech that they are being used in Google's Cloud Machine Learning platform.\n\nGoogle says they're not giving any more information about the TPU chips at this time."", 'Starting next September, some logistics companies in Finland, Sweden, Estonia, and Latvia will begin outfitting shipping containers with a soda-can-size device that will beam out the cargo’s location, how much it’s vibrating as it travels, and its ambient temperature. The data will flow into a repository in the cloud so the entire supply chain can be informed if a shipment’s been delayed. That will prevent redundant e-mails and phone calls. “There are massive problems communicating between companies,” says Mika Lammi, who’s overseeing the project from his perch at Kouvola Innovation, a business development agency in southern Finland. “Instead of having separate databases, why not have a single blockchain where everyone can pool information?”\n\nTo continue reading this article you must be a Bloomberg Professional Service Subscriber.

The national legislature, the Duma, has been deliberating the bill since earlier this year.\n\nUp for debate is the extent to which those who issue or circulate private monies in Russia will be punished. Reports out of Russia have indicated that some advocates are pushing for multi-year jail sentences and fines, though the latest news points to disagreements among some in government about how to approach regulation for the technology.\n\nObservers have suggested that defects within the bill may have doomed it from the start.\n\nIn statements, Nikita Soshnikov, partner at Moscow-based Tolkachev and Partners Law Firm, called the bill ""poorly drafted"".\n\nSoshnikov told CoinDesk:\n\n""The [Finance] Ministry has not provided [the] appropriate justification for criminalization of cryptocurrencies and its public danger (as an essential criterion for criminalization). The draft is broadly worded, therefore, wide range of activities regarding e-currencies can potentially fall within proposed \'money surrogates\' definition.""\n\nAdditionally, according to Soshnikov, the bill itself was said to have contained redundancies that sparked criticism from the Justice Ministry.\n\n""[The] Russian Ministry of Justice stated that Russian Criminal Code already provides for similar regulations that criminalize illegal turnover of means of payment,"" he said.\n\nBill\'s future unclear\n\nSoshnikov went on to say that it was ""unsurprising"" that the bill had attracted criticism from the Justice Ministry, a move that he said was likely to postpone further debate or passage of the bill for the foreseeable future.\n\n""It is unclear when the proposed draft will be submitted to the State Duma and hopefully [it] will be subject to further public discussions,” he said.\n\nOne other possible wrinkle in the debate, as suggested by comments provided to CoinDesk, is whether digital currencies should be treated separately from non-financial applications of the blockchain. The Russian Finance Ministry has indicated its desire to take this approach in the past, even while other officials, including those from the country’s central bank, have previously indicated it may not support this approach.\n\nAlexey Troshichev, blockchain architect for domestic payment processing services Qiwi, suggested that restrictions on certain aspects of the technology would impair genuine innovation.\n\n""How [will] startups, how [will] other companies will experiment if they won\'t be allowed to buy bitcoins?"" Troshichev told CoinDesk.\n\nHe cautioned that those in the global community should realize that the discussions in region remain broad, and that understanding that the technologies are linked is coming gradually.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""This is [at the] very early stage. It arrives at the question that we should unite and discuss them as a whole, not just separately.""\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That movement is approaching a long-term resistance line, from which it may rebound up.\n\nThe long-term correction is continuing\n\nAfter breaking through the key level of $455, Bitcoin’s price could not fortify it. The bears were holding the advantage, which led to Bitcoin’s price falling and fortifying below that mark. The downward rebound scenario has played out.\n\nThe level of $455 remains a point where the downward trend, which has started at $460, could be broken. The downward movement is part of a long-term correction. Thus, we should find an important target, from which Bitcoin’s price could bounce up, because there was no turnaround on a long-term scale. Several important instruments are intersecting at the $440 mark: a diagonal channel, and a moving average 55, at which the average 5 has been fortifying from March till April. Two scenarios are possible at that level: continuation of the long-term upward trend, or formation of a turn to decline.\n\nRight now the odds are on the side of a long-term upward trend. That’s why there is a chance of a rebound from the $440 resistance line.', 'Press Release: CoinWarz, a platform that allows miners to compare cryptocurrency mining profitability, recently launched their Ethereum mining calculator. The launch was timed perfectly with ‘The DAO’ crowdfund – a project with the potential to push Ethereum mining profitability to the moon.\n\nCoinwarz, a service that provides mining profitability information for cryptocurrencies, has just launched an Ethereum mining calculator that shows the profitability of Ethereum mining. The launch was made possible via the partnership with Genesis Mining – Ethereum’s largest mining company in the world.\n\nThis service is perfectly timed with the DAO crowdfunding project, the largest crowdfunding in the history of any cryptocurrency. The DAO has raised more than $140 million and is a landmark in the history of the Ethereum protocol. The currency price has increased more than 60% since the beginning of the crowdfunding project.\n\nWith this activity, Coinwarz reinforces itself as one of the most innovative and reliable services in its market. Operating since 2013 with more than 400 cryptocurrencies listed and currently showing mining profitability for 77 cryptocurrencies, Coinwarz has helped thousands of people to make good cryptocurrency mining investments.\n\nThe most important part of calculating mining profitability is being able to calculate how much money can be made mining one cryptocurrency versus another cryptocurrency. Since Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency, mining profitability comparisons are made against mining Bitcoin. And now, with THE DAO pushing the Ethereum price to the moon, mining Ethereum is three times more profitable to mine than Bitcoin with a new $ 1,000 mining rig.\n\nThe mining calculator for Ethereum was made possible by the partnership between Coinwarz and Genesis Mining, which helped and sponsored development. Genesis Mining is the world’s largest mining company for Ethereum and has worked to publicize Ethereum to the mainstream public and offer services that are invaluable to its users.\n\nThis strategic partnership between the largest solution provider for mining profitability and the world’s largest mining company is strategically important for investors in decision-making.\n\nAn exclusive discount for the first 100 Ethereum contracts in Genesis Mining is available by using the code: COINWARZ at checkout.\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nName: Tim Willis – Media Coordinator\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nCity: Hong Kong\n\nCoinWarz is the source of this content.

05/20/2016,"['Bitcoin is being tested like never before as one of the biggest and oldest Bitcoin company, Coinbase, announced their exchange will be renamed to Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX) to support Ethereum trading. A first for the four years old bitcoin company which has never added any other digital currency.\n\nThe move comes as Ethereum gains mainstream attention due to the DAO raising a record-breaking $165 million as of publishing, leading to a moon-like-price-increase of ether and trading volumes of more than $50 million per day.\n\nThe Ethereum community is euphoric with one Ethereumer stating: “I could not have dreamed of what has in fact happened in the last 4 days” and a general atmosphere of jubilation in the community as they open their metaphorical bottles of champagne.\n\nThey believe in smart contracts, the internet of things, a fourth industrial revolution and, of course, decentralized autonomous organizations. They are supported by an impeccable team of developers with their own open source culture and spirit, along with boy genius Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn contrast, the mood in Bitcoin is somber with some expressing worries and concerns while some could not keep their anger. R/btc, the biggest uncensored Bitcoin-related social forum was metaphorically on fire as everyone took turns to voice their complaints. Even in r/bitcoin, a heavily censored subreddit, most users expressed puzzlement with a lack of capacity increase, interrupted by some complaining about their transactions that’re stuck for hours.\n\nBitcoin remains the most accepted digital currency with the largest market cap and trading volume. Few Bitcoiners, on either side of the debate, or even ethereumers, want to see it fail, with one ether holder expressing the mood: “Bitcoin tanking – kinda makes me sad to see an old friend that way.”\n\nHowever, the never-ending debate is taking its toll as any resolution seems unlikely with Mark Friedenbach, a Core Tech Engineer at Blockstream, stating:\n\n“I don’t know anyone who is actually working on a hard fork right now… very few core developers were at the HK meeting and that ‘agreement’ is mostly not acceptable to those who were not there.”\n\nPer Bitcoin Core’s “consensus” requirements, that makes the hard-fork controversial and unlikely to be merged, breaching the Hong Kong roundtable “consensus” which clearly states:\n\n“We will run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core.”\n\nIt may well be the case, therefore, that we do not see any capacity increase for many more months, if this year at all, adding fuel to Ethereum’s bid for mainstream adoption.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A hacker who claimed responsibility for the Hacking Team and Gamma Group breaches has sent €10,000 of stolen bitcoin to the autonomous region of Rojava in northern Syria, according to arstechnica.co.uk.\n\nUsing the pseudonyms “Hack Back!” and “Phineas Phisher” and “@GammaGroupPR,” the hacker indicated an unwillingness to name the victims since there is hope of “a few orders of magnitude more on the way.”\n\nRojava is one of the most inspiring revolutionary projects in the world today. I just donated 10000€ in bitcoin https://t.co/2ubZctplSy — Hack Back! (@GammaGroupPR) May 5, 2016\n\nThe hacker described Rojava as one of the most inspiring revolutionary projects in the world.\n\nHard-To-Define Region\n\nRojava is not easy to define since the area neighbors a Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) haven that the U.S. State Department has called a terrorist organization. The PKK seeks to create an independent Kurdish homeland.\n\nThe New York Times last year reported significant contrasts with ISIL/Daesh, a group that has been warring with Rojava. One contrast is a constitution mandating freedom of religion and gender equality.\n\nThe region has struggled to feed itself and seeks donations for farm equipment, according to a crowdfunding page. Conflicts with ISIL/Daesh and with Turkey has cut the region from foreign trade.\n\nDeniz Tari, from Rojava Plan, emailed Ars that the group is busy and finds it hard at times go to get online. The campaign page notes payments have been made to the group, Tari noted. The bitcoin address is public.\n\nThe page lists a €10,000 donation from “Hack Back.” A transaction for 25 bitcoin, date stamped 5-5-2016 was sent to the Rojava Plan bitcoin address.\n\nTari said people can send checks to the campaign and find out where the money is going.\n\nCampaign Wins Donations\n\nThe campaign has received more than €26,000 at this report, including a plan to purchase a small bulldozer, a hangar and two small trucks. One goal is to recycle human and animal waste as ecological fertilizer for wheat farms.\n\nThe hacker told Ars that the group is in a difficult situation with U.S. ally Turkey on one side and ISIS on the other. Turkey has embargoed the group.\n\nWhile the West likes to view this part of the world as backwards, the people there are creating a society that takes values such as feminism and democracy to degrees that put the West to shame, the hacker said.\n\nThe group is also winning in its fight against ISIS, unlike the U.S.-trained and supplied army of Iraq, the hacker added.\n\nIn addition to supporting Rojava, the hacker donated money to draw media coverage to the region, an area that too often defaulted to a “gimmicky article about women fighting in ISIS” with a picture of a woman with a gun.\n\nA Model Libertarian Movement?\n\nRojava should be compared to libertarian revolutions or anarchist movements such as the Ukrainian Free Territory, the Paris Commune, the Spanish Civil War, the Zapatistas, CIP-FRM, APPO, the Seattle General Strike of 1991 and autonomous Shinmin, the hacker noted.\n\nRojava is bounded to the south and west by the Euphrates River and to the East by Iraq. It stretches the Syrian-Turkish border for about 400 kilometers. The sections are divided by nearly 100 kilometers of ISIL-controlled territory.\n\nJohn Kirby, a U.S. State Department spokesperson, told Reuters in March the U.S. does not support self-ruled, semi-autonomous zones inside Syria.\n\n“If you do talk about [Rojava’s] politics, misrepresent them as a Kurdish nationalist movement fighting to establish a Kurdish state,” the hacker told Ars. “Because of course a neoliberal ‘democratic’ state is what any freedom-loving people would want.”\n\nProfessor Gives Perspective\n\nDavid Graeber, a London School of Economics professor, visited Rojava in December 2014 and said he agreed with the hacker’s view that the region strongly resembles prior anarchist movements. The difference being that Rojava is a radical, anti-authoritarian movement that is “supereffective” militarily.\n\nGraeber did not accept the idea that the funds would support something besides purchasing farm equipment. He said they have dire economic needs, but militarily, they are getting what they need from Russia and the U.S., even though those countries will not admit this.\n\nGraeber said Rojava gets most weapons from ISIS since it has better fighters. Tari stressed the point that Rojava Plan is not part of the region’s military.\n\nTari told Ars the plan is part of the economic committee for civil, not military, projects. If it gets a million Euros, it will use it to fund other projects such as the Kurdish Ubuntu distro and earthbags for construction.\n\nAlso read: Islamic State probably isn’t using BTC and, if so, they’re dumb\n\nAmnesty International Raises Issues\n\nAmnesty International in October 2015 raised questions in a report on Rojava, concluding the group’s military was razing of villages amounted to war crimes.\n\nLama Fakih, a senior crisis advisor at Amnesty International, said the autonomous administration has abused its authority and flouted international law by intentionally destroying civilian homes and in some cases razing complete villages and displacing people with no justifiable military purpose.\n\nAsked if the bitcoin donation could support further war crimes, the hacker said the Amnesty International report is misleading. He said Amnesty International interviewed groups actively fighting Rojava’s military. He said people fled fighting that destroyed villages, an action that became interpreted as forcibly displacing people and razing their village.\n\nHe also said Rojava is not solely a Kurdish revolution as there are many Arabs living there. He said both Rojava and Arabs living there released statements condemning the Amnesty International report.\n\nGraeber said when he was in Rojava, people told him they were anti-capitalist, but they have learned that they can’t destroy it until they get rid of the state, which requires getting rid of the patriarchy. This is why there are a lot of women soldiers.\n\nGraeber said one of the first places his guides took him to was a police academy, where the goal was to give everyone six weeks of police training, then abolishing the police.\n\nThe U.S. State Department declined to comment for this story.\n\nFeatured image of Syria from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'While bitcoin has long dominated the digital currency space, ether has been grabbing headlines – and trading volume – this week as global market participants rally around the digital currency.\n\nThe price of ether – the digital currency used by the Ethereum platform – surged by upwards of 50% in the seven days through 20th May, according to figures from US-based digital currency exchange Poloniex.\n\nBitcoin prices, alternatively, fluctuated less than 5% during the aforementioned time frame.\n\nEther had an opening value of $10 at 12:00 UTC on 13th May, additional Poloniex data reveals. The currency fell to as low as $9.78 at 08:20 UTC on 14th May, and then lingered near $10 for the next few sessions.\n\nOn 16th May, the currency began a sharp climb, culminating in it finishing the week at $14.65. Trading volume rose substantially during the week, as 24-hour volume increased from $12.1m at 11:59 pm on 12th May to $58.3m at 11:59 pm on 19th May.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, had a far less dramatic week, opening at $454.82 and spending most of the week fluctuating between $450 and $460, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). It was on 19th May that the digital currency registered notable declines, falling to a weekly low of $435.62.\n\nThe week’s lackluster bitcoin price movements came amid very low trading volume, as Bitcoinity data points reveal market participants traded less than 8m BTC during the seven days through 20th May.\n\nDAO interest rising\n\nMany market observers are crediting ether’s recent price increase to the rise of a distributed organization referred to as The DAO, an Ethereum-based entity which allows market participants to provide both startup businesses and projects with funding – in the form of ether – in exchange for voting rights.\n\n“The desire for many to purchase DAO Tokens” has helped create “a huge amount of cross trading in the BTC/ETH trading pair,” Joe Lee, founder of derivatives trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk.\n\n“The token sale is structured in a way that for a time after the crowdsale has completed, DAO token holders get a freely exercisable option to either burn or swap the newly minted tokens back for ether,” he continued. “This clever structure has incentivised a large number of ETH holders to take part in the crowdsale.”\n\nChris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, said he believes the The DAO is likely responsible for ether’s recent price rally.\n\n“The ETH/BTC pair has now appreciated 50% since Monday,” he said.\n\nAt press time, the organization has collected more than 11m ETH, worth nearly $160m at current prices.\n\nBuilding support\n\nWhile ether experienced a sharp rally during the last week, one market expert highlighted that the digital currency may be retracing old steps when compared to bitcoin.\n\n“Ether is doing the same thing bitcoin is, which is building a support level,” Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, told CoinDesk. ""The price seems to have stabilized.""\n\nHowever, as Enneking went on to articulate, there are lingering question questions about the extent to which ether\'s rise is a referendum on problems with bitcoin.\n\n“How much of ether’s price is due to its positive aspects and how much can be credited to the failings (or challenges) of bitcoin?” he asked.\n\nWhile it’s too early to tell, traders are likely to be watching for signs of correlated market movements between Ethereum and bitcoin.\n\nPotential price bubbles\n\nWhile some have asserted that the visibility surrounding The DAO helped drive this week’s rise in ether prices, others have warned that these gains could be be short-lived.\n\nGeorge Samman, a blockchain advisor and consultant, predicted that the broader markets will expect ether prices to fall once The DAO\'s creation phase is over.\n\n“Once DAO ends, it will suck up over 12% of all ether,"" he told CoinDesk. “Expect ether to fall right before the DAO ends as people front-run the event.”\n\nBurniske took a different tack, speaking to the price bubbles that could potentially develop in digital currencies.\n\n“The cryptocurrency space is gaining more attention by the day, which can easily lead to tulip-mania and price bubbles,” he said.\n\nCharles L.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'On 2nd May 2016, the founder of Bitcoin was revealed as Craig Wright.\n\nOn his blog, and subsequently explained in interviews with The Economist, BBC and GQ, the Australian entrepreneur, signed a message with the private key for the address of the miner of ""block 9"". Bitcoin earned with Block 9 was the first recorded transaction between Satoshi - the pseudonym used to launch Bitcoin - and Hal Finney, a cryptographer and early Bitcoin subscriber.\n\nSince its launch on 3rd January 2009, the founder of Bitcoin had remained a secret. For many in the cryptocurrency community, this is the evidence they were looking for.\n\nIn many ways, the relevance of Bitcoin to responsible investment depends on how you define responsible investment. If responsible investment is limited to the process of integrating ESG in investment decision-making then it\'s probably not relevant. If responsible investment is also about the integrity and stability of the financial system then it probably is.\n\nBitcoin is a decentralised digital currency, meaning that the database used to record Bitcoins are not centrally controlled. These systems are built using a \'distributed ledger\', or \'blockchain\', which is a decentralised public database collectively maintained by a network of people, known as \'miners\', who run the software. There is no bank or country responsible for issuing Bitcoin meaning there\'s no central point that can fail.\n\nBitcoin\'s elegance is that - unlike a normal banking system - it ties its money creation process to the process of validating payments: As a reward for facilitating payments (moving existing Bitcoins between participants), the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin tokens that are put into circulation. They are incentivised to maintain the payments system.\n\nBitcoin transactions are anonymous, yet transparent. Bitcoin addresses aren\'t linked to names or other personal identification. A single person may hold dozens of addresses and even transfer between them. However, the number of Bitcoins per address is public. Transactions are international, arrive within minutes and fees are miniscule.\n\nWithin the Bitcoin business ecosystem some businesses have gained scale. These include merchant payments processor Bitpay, the wallet company and exchange Coinbase and Blockchain.info. The use of the distributed ledgers has gained scale too. Ripple\'s distributed financial technology allows bank to transact without the need for a central counterparty. The use of blockchains to issue shares (\'cryptoequity\') is already being tested by companies like Overstock. Recently NASDAQ piloted a blockchain clearing system for shares.\n\nBlockchain was the talk of this year\'s Davos, even by the likes of Christine Lagarde. An IMF paper on virtual currencies concluded the concept has the potential to ""change finance"". The World Economic Forum identified Blockchain as one of its six mega-trends.\n\nFor investors, Blockchain technology could affect the post-trade value chain, eliminating clearing, settlement and counterparty risk. Blockchain technology aligns with our industry\'s agenda of trust, transparency and reduced cost. Through secure, affordable cash transfer, cryptocurrencies could open-up investment opportunities to the planet\'s most remote communities, shortening the intermediation chain.\n\nCryptocurrencies are a risk too. Bitcoin was the currency of choice for Silk Road, a \'darknet market\', known for buying and selling illegal drugs, and even weapons. Person to person transactions, independent of the formal banking system, can facilitate tax avoidance. Historically, cryptocurrencies have been highly volatile, anonymity presents security threats and 850,000 Bitcoins, valued at $450 million, were lost or stolen when Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy. Most importantly, cryptocurrencies are unregulated: Their growth could threaten the role of central banks in setting monetary and exchange rate policy. Despite this, or perhaps because of this, cryptocurrencies deserve attention.\n\n10 years ago when the UN\'s Principles for Responsible Investment was set up, Facebook had just a few thousand users and the iPhone wasn\'t invented. Collectively Bitcoin, its database system, blockchain, and other cryptocurrencies, are creating the future of electronic payments. They are a cornerstone of the emergent truly international, cashless society. Bitcoin is not yet a dominant force in financial reform or innovation right now, but it\'s certainly gaining credibility.\n\nThe currency\'s website, bitcoin.org, boldly claims ""Bitcoin is changing finance the same way as the web changed publishing"". Perhaps marketing, perhaps not, but regardless, the responsible investor would be unwise to ignore.\n\nThis article was first published on Responsible Investor: https://www.responsible-investor.com/home/article/will_martindale_bitcoin_fact_or_fiction/\n\nThanks to Brett Scott who contributed to the PRI\'s research on alternative forms of finance.

He figured he might as well collect some to supplement the money he was bringing in through websites he had setup with some sketchy ad networks.\n\n""Over the course of one semester I\'d gotten around 150 Bitcoins, which at the time was worth around $11.

So as not to lose his Bitcoins—his whole $11—he penned a ""little sarcastic note"" to himself and folded it over his old hard drive.\n\nThat was six years ago. He since graduated and is making ""decent(ish"" money, and until recently forgot all about those Bitcoins.\n\n""Fast forward to last month and I\'m moving to a smaller apartment (more expensive area), and had to be picky about what I could take. I had an old box of PC parts. I had a quick look through and marveled at the 256MB RAM sticks, the 40GB HDDs. I even had a few floppy disks! All of it worthless with today\'s hardware. So in the trash it all went,"" he said.\n\nThen earlier this week, he found the sarcastic note he\'d written to himself while unpacking one of his boxes.\n\n""I chuckled to myself for a split second before realizing bitcoins are worth a fair bit today, at which point panic set it. I\'ve been Googling for several hours but it seems I\'m fucked, the Bitcoins are gone!,"" he said.

And, prosecutors say, the two men accepted more than $3.5 million in cash, money orders, and MoneyPak prepaid cards in exchange for bitcoin they would purchase from online exchanges. The case, one of a handful in recent years to bring charges for operating unlicensed bitcoin operations, highlights the vagaries involved in regulating the buying and selling of virtual currencies. In the U.S. and elsewhere, these transactions are subject to federal and local anti-money laundering laws, which require sellers of bitcoin to verify the identities of their customers, just as banks do. “Unfortunately, it often comes down to how good of a lawyer you have.” While U.S. federal law requires money service businesses—traditionally, enterprises like check-cashing stores and money transmitters like Western Union and PayPal—to register with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN, and obtain any required state licenses, experts say exactly when those requirements apply to bitcoin trades can still be unclear. “It’s very fuzzy,” says lawyer Marco Santori, a partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman and the leader of the firm’s digital currency and blockchain technology team, referring to when a trading operation falls under federal rules. “It’s heavily dependent on what we like to call the facts and circumstances test, which is not a test at all–it’s just how good of a narrative you can construct. Unfortunately, it often comes down to how good of a lawyer you have.” State rules can also vary significantly, with some states allowing money transmitters to operate with no licenses at all, and others implementing policies specifically aimed at regulating cryptocurrency businesses. New York’s so-called BitLicense, probably the most famous of these, has been the subject of some complaints from bitcoin-related startups after delays in issuing licenses, though businesses already in operation are allowed to continue under a “safe harbor” provision while their licenses are processed. Meanwhile, Craigslist-style sites like LocalBitcoins, where the Lords apparently sold bitcoin to unknown buyers, along with other classified sites like Gliph and Craigslist itself, don’t not fall under FinCEN regulations themselves because they’re not technically centralized bitcoin exchanges.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn 2013, FinCEN issued a document saying mere users of virtual currencies aren’t money servicing businesses, but exchangers of the currencies are. “A user is a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services,” the agency said. “An exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency.” Certain bitcoin users are willing to pay a premium for a one-on-one transaction, and the anonymity it can bring, rather than buy and sell through an online exchange. Simply buying, selling, or even mining bitcoin for your own use or investment doesn’t put make you the operator of a money services business, any more than buying and selling stock through a broker puts you legally in the securities business, says corporate finance lawyer Martin Mushkin. “Generally speaking, if you are buying and selling for yourself on the web, our view is that you are not in the money service business because you are simply a day trader,” he says. But the question becomes more complicated when users trade bitcoin outside of the confines of licensed web exchanges. Advertisers on LocalBitcoins and other classified-style sites are often able to sell bitcoin at a higher price, or buy it at a lower price, than through formal exchanges for the same reason that government officials are concerned: Certain bitcoin users are willing to pay a premium for a one-on-one transaction, and the anonymity it can bring, rather than buy and sell through an online exchange. In some ways, the legal situation is similar to the laws around firearm sales, where gun dealers are required to hold federal licenses and conduct background checks, but individual sales go unregulated, leaving room in the middle for gun hobbyists who sell with some regularity but without setting up a full-time business.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“Law enforcement officials are particularly concerned about face-to-face cryptocurrency exchanges because they have been used as money laundering platforms,” according to a 2014 Department of Homeland Security report. “Not only do these transactions require no [personally identifiable information] to be exchanged, which makes the transactions completely anonymous, one can convert anything of value into Bitcoin simply by bartering or buying them.” DHS has been active in investigating a number of bitcoin exchange-related cases, according to court records, apparently maintaining a task force targeting the use of digital-currency money laundering. Often alleged operators of unlicensed exchanges are also charged with laundering the proceeds of drugs, or other illegal activity. In one pending case, Anthony R. Murgio, the alleged operator of a purported unlicensed online exchange called Coin.mx, is charged partially in connection with claims the exchange sold bitcoin to victims of ransomware attacks, who were hoping to use the currency to pay blackmailers to unlock their personal data. Murgio has pleaded not guilty. “Anthony is vigorously contesting the charges,” says attorney Brian Klein, a partner at Baker Marquart who represents Murgio. “And he is looking forward to getting his day in court.” In 2013, the U.S. closed Liberty Reserve, an unlicensed exchange where it alleged that the site’s widely used digital currency was being used to launder proceeds from credit card trafficking, identity theft, Ponzi schemes, and hacking. This month, one of the site’s founders received a 20-year prison sentence, while the other, who agreed to help prosecute his ex-partner, was sentenced to 10 years. As part of a plea deal with the Lords, prosecutors agreed to drop additional charges against the two Shreveport men, including a money laundering charge tied to an alleged $14,000 cash-for-bitcoin trade with a drug informant, as well as wire fraud charges relating to the credit card transactions. Neither the Lords’ attorney, nor federal prosecutors, replied to multiple requests for comment.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile some bitcoin trading advertisers on sites like LocalBitcoins may be effectively running exchanges–the Lords allegedly took money from buyers that they’d immediately use to buy bitcoin online–others may simply be investors taking advantage of better exchange rates available through person-to-person transactions. Generally, most people who have been charged in connection with unlicensed exchanges have also been linked by prosecutors to other illegal activity, such as online illicit drug sales. That’s the position Colorado engineer Burt Wagner says he was in in 2014, when he was arrested by federal agents and charged in connection with operating an unlicensed “digital currency exchange business.” Wagner says he mostly bought and sold bitcoin through Mt. Gox, the leading online exchange at the time, but he also advertised on LocalBitcoins, meeting up with local trading partners at coffee shops and the like. “It was a small part of my entire trading,” he says. “The main reason I did it was just to meet bitcoiners and chat with them.” An indictment filed in the case alleged that Wagner handled funds “known to the defendant to have been derived from a criminal offense and were intended to be used to promote and support unlawful activity,” but Wagner says he never knowingly did any shady deals. The charges against him were dropped in 2015—though not before, he says, he paid thousands of dollars in legal fees. Federal prosecutors declined, through a spokesman, to comment on the case, and many of the documents in his case remain under seal. But from documents that are available, it appears he was tied by authorities, correctly or not, to alleged dark web drug transactions. “The indictment in this case follows a 15-month investigation involving online and conventional undercover activities,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing. “Specifically, the investigation involves individuals engaging in digital currency transactions and/or the purchase and sale of controlled substances over the internet using ‘Deep Web’ black marketplaces.”\n\nadvertisement', 'The Bitcoiners “FU” (shorthand for fuck up on the subrredit r/tifu) started six years ago when he was in college. As he states on the forum known as ‘Today I Fucked Up:’\n\nBack then, “I had a hugely over-inflated sense of how intelligent I was. Rare for someone on reddit I know.”\n\nHe chose to, instead of get a part time job, make money on the internet. He set up an ad network of internet webpages.\n\n“I also came across this thing called bitcoin, and people were giving them away for free on some websites,” he wrote, referencing Bitcoin faucets. “Everything I read about them said they were going to be the next big thing. Awesome, I’ll get myself some of those. Over the course of 1 semester I’d gotten around 150 bitcoins, which at the time was worth around $11.00. What a waste of fucking time! These things haven’t exploded like they were supposed to, back to my matched betting and AwesomeTM websites!”\n\nThe redditor stored his bitcoins on his laptop. When he upgraded his laptop in the next semester with more RAM and a 7200 HDD, he left himself a sarcastic note on the bitcoins…\n\n“That was the last time I paid any attention to bitcoin, it wasn’t too long before I graduated and started to earn decent(ish) money,” he wrote. “Fast forward to last month and I’m moving to a smaller apartment (more expensive area), and had to be picky about what I could take.”\n\nHe sorted through “old box of PC parts” and threw it all in the trash. He used the same box for things to bring to his new apartment. Due to his “laziness,” he didn’t immediately go through the boxes.\n\n“Tonight after a 4 hour reddit session I unpacked one of the boxes, and I found THIS,” he wrote, chuckling to himself upon finding his note, but only for a second. Realizing bitcoins are worth more today, “panic set [in].” Shortly, he realized they bitcoins were unretrievable.\n\n“I’ve been googling for several hours but it seems I’m fucked, the bitcoins are gone! At least they weren’t worth the millions that my idiotic self thought when I first found the note, but that’s not much consolation.”\n\nAs he summarizes of the fate of his fortune: “earned $11.00 worth of bitcoin, 5 years later threw them out when they were worth $67,000!”\n\nAll he has is the note. He doesn’t recall which wallet he used, and he was no password. He plans toscour his emails, documents and anything that could lead to the recovery of his bitcoins, “but I’m not too hopeful,” he writes.\n\nHe doesn’t think they at an online wallet service. He once almost sold them, “but the ID verification etc all looked like too much effort for $10.00.”\n\nHe recalls, “it took an age to sync with the network or some such.”\n\nAs for the bitcoins, they still exist on bitcoin’s “public ledger” for anyone who can get the “private key,” and the .dat fi. Most users save multiple copies of the .dat file to save themselves from the grief the Reddit user, who goes by _, is now experiencing. He didn’t remember he even had the coins until discovering the note in the box. Many users have sent considerable ChangeTip tips to the user.\n\nThe story rhymes with the experience an English man, named James Howells, who lost bitcoins in a landfill in 2013. His hard drive landed at the Docksway landfill site near Newport, Wales. At the time, the sum of the bitcoins were more than £4m.\n\nHe was clearing his desk and threw it in the trash, with 7,500 bitcoins on it.\n\n“You know when you put something in the bin, and in your head, say to yourself ‘that’s a bad idea’? I really did have that,” Howells told the Guardian. “I don’t have an exact date, the only time period I can give – and I’ve been racking my own brains – is between 20 June and 10 August. Probably mid-July.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Altcoins have a long tradition in the Bitcoin community, but they tend to cause a contentious divide among those who think they’re useful and those who think they’re all scams. One side of the argument, articulated by the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute’s Daniel Krawisz, is that altcoins have no chance of success and distract possible users from Bitcoin, while the other side, articulated by many Ethereum supporters, believe platforms such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can work together.\n\nJohnny Dilley, who runs strategy at Blockstream, was recently asked for his thoughts on altcoins during an interview on The Crypto Show. Dilley believes the vast majority of altcoins are scams, and he also thinks Bitcoin developers are not threatened by the existence of these alternative cryptocurrencies. The incentive for altcoin speculators to promote uncertainty in the Bitcoin community was also discussed.\n\nThe Vast Majority of Altcoins Are Scams\n\nWhen first asked about altcoins, Dilley echoed recent statements made by Monero developer Riccardo Spagni and stated, “I continue to believe that the vast majority of altcoins are scams. They provide no functionality whatsoever, or the functionality they could provide could very easily be implemented via a sidechain.”\n\nA sidechain is an alternative blockchain to Bitcoin that uses the same Bitcoin currency through a pegging mechanism. The idea is to allow developers to experiment with completely new blockchains without having to bootstrap a new currency network (altcoin). Bitcoin Hivemind and Rootstock are two examples of sidechains currently in development. Blockstream has handled the vast majority of the development work for sidechains up to this point.\n\nDilley went on to discuss the security concerns associated with altcoins. Critics often point to low network hashrates and alternative consensus models as potential risks of these alternatives to Bitcoin. Dilley added, “If you’re going to fall back to [a weaker security model], you might as well be piggybacking off Bitcoin via sidechains.”\n\nBitcoin Developers Not Threatened by Altcoins\n\nIn terms of whether altcoins are a threat to Bitcoin, Dilley said:\n\n“I don’t think the Bitcoin developers ? they’re not doing things from a perceived competitive perspective. Their perspective is: ‘I have this awesome piece of technology, and I want to be able to help develop it and bring it more into what I think is interesting to build on top of this.’ So no, I don’t think it’s from a perceived threat of any of the altcoins.”\n\nIn the past, many altcoins have marketed themselves with some sort of comparative advantage to Bitcoin. For example, some altcoins have touted faster confirmation times; others claim to offer privacy enhancements. For the most part, Bitcoin developers have focused on implementing their own innovations rather than responding to what’s going on with the altcoin market.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin developers may not view altcoins as serious threats, Zcash CEO and longtime cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn recently warned the Bitcoin community to not become too complacent in the push for Bitcoin.\n\nDoes Uncertainty in Bitcoin Fuel Altcoins?\n\nThere has been some uncertainty in the Bitcoin market recently due to the ongoing scaling debate. Dilley was asked on The Crypto Show whether he thinks this uncertainty has led to some Bitcoin holders fleeing into altcoins. At first, Dilley responded, “I think there’s some serious, perverse incentives [for altcoin holders to cause uncertainty for Bitcoin], and that’s a broader topic.”\n\nDilley went on to explain that there are definitely some members of the Bitcoin community who would seize on the opportunity to attack if they saw an opportunity to increase their return on an altcoin speculation. The head of strategy at Blockstream pointed to the large number of scams in the Bitcoin ecosystem over the past few years as a way to explain that there is no shortage of nefarious actors in the space.\n\nIn addition to altcoin promoters, Mastering Bitcoin author Andreas Antonopoulos has noted the likelihood of attacks from various government agencies. Online Bitcoin discussions have turned into schoolyard-esque yelling matches over the past year, but it’s unclear how much of the divisiveness in the community has been organic. There are plenty of incentives for a variety of different types of non-Bitcoin users to throw gasoline on the fire.']"
05/21/2016,"[""In an article I wrote two years ago about the future of money, I explained that despite the libertarian fantasies that were being bandied about at the time, Bitcoin was unlikely to ever be a mainstream currency. News in January suggested that Bitcoin may be collapsing and key figures in the community may be backing away from it.\n\nThe reasons for Bitcoin’s troubles are many, including poor governance, a lack of technological infrastructure and infighting within its community. Besides, as I noted in my previous article, the fact that sovereign governments have the power to tax in their own currencies always made a Bitcoin takeover unlikely.\n\nStill, as Don and Alex Tapscott explain in their new book, The Blockchain Revolution, the technology behind Bitcoin may indeed be revolutionary. In fact, despite Bitcoin’s challenges there are already thousands of entrepreneurs and investors betting on blockchain technology to reimagine transactions of all types. It’s still early days, but the potential is undeniable.\n\nThe Trust Protocol\n\nWhat makes blockchain technology so useful—and potentially transformative—is its ability to create trust between two parties that don’t know each other, which is why the Tapscott’s refer to it as a “trust protocol.”\n\nAs Marc Andreessen pointed out in in 2014 in his excellent NY Times piece, the best way to understand blockchains is through the Byzantine Generals Problem. Imagine a group of generals that needs to coordinate an attack, but must do so only through intermediaries. Clearly, trust becomes an issue, because of the possibility that their communication will be sabotaged.\n\nOne way of solving the Byzantine Generals Problem is by establishing a trusted third party, which is the role that governments and other institutions have traditionally played in financial transactions. Yet a third party is not a true solution, because there’s always the possibility that the third party can be corrupted as well. In effect, it merely assumes away the problem.\n\nBlockchains solve the trust protocol by creating a distributed ledger, almost as if the generals could constantly refer to an encrypted Reddit post that they all had access to. What makes the technology so exciting is that there is a wide variety of areas beyond financial transactions where trust is important.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nTraditionally, one major way that we have legislated trust in our society is through contracts, which codify obligations, penalties and the jurisdiction whose laws will enforce the agreement. These can be incredibly cumbersome documents, often running to hundreds of pages.\n\nConsider the case of a building project, in which a general contractor must sign agreements with hundreds of subcontractors. To enforce these contracts, work must be inspected and then, if it passes muster, it goes to an accounts payable department, which authorizes payment and instructs a bank to wire the proper amount. The process usually takes at least a few weeks.\n\nHowever, a smart contract powered by a blockchain can streamline the process through automation. Using a simple tablet computer, an inspector can instantly activate the smart contract, which has all of the provisions of agreement embedded within it, to arrange settlement, including payment.\n\nThis is just one example, but the possibilities are endless. Another exciting areas is rights management for intellectual property. By integrating settlement, enforcement and other aspects of agreements with smart contracts, we can not only create enormous efficiencies, but also make our lives a lot easier.\n\nBlockchain Resumes\n\nAnother area where trust plays a large role is in the employment marketplace. Job seekers seek to present their qualifications in the very best light, so it’s important for potential employers to be able to verify experience and skills. Many firms have elaborate—and expensive— interview and testing protocols to help make the right choices about the people they hire.\n\nYet despite the veneer of sophistication, the primary employment search tool remains the humble resume. Sure, today these often take a digital form, such as a PDF file or a LinkedIn profile, but it’s still basically the same old resume.\n\nBlockchain technology has the potential to bring the hiring process into the 21st century by embedding authentication within the resume itself. One school has already begun using blockchain to authenticate its degrees. The same can be done for previous employment or even work done on specific projects.\n\nAnother advantage of blockchain resumes is their ability to authenticate non-traditional experience, like freelance jobs done on platforms like Upwork or work done on open source platforms like Github, the Apache Foundation or Wikipedia, giving a much fuller picture of an applicant's skills.\n\nA Ledger Of Things\n\nWhile we tend to think of trust as an element of personal interactions, it is also becoming increasingly important for machines. To connect to a WiFi network, for example, we have to be able to trust that it won’t load any unauthorized programs that will monitor our activity or steal our passwords.\n\nThis will only become more important as we become increasingly dependent on the Internet of Things. As everyday devices, such as cars, home appliances and security systems become connected online, the standard password method of authenticating and authorizing access will not be sufficient.\n\nBlockchains can greatly improve on passwords because they represent an entire digital identity. So a hacker would have to create an entire history of legitimate activity in order to gain authorization for access. That wouldn’t be impossible, but it would be much harder to do and a clean blockchain would become tainted after a single intrusion.\n\nAs Alex Tapscott has put it, The Internet of Things needs a Ledger of Things.\n\nThe Revolution Will Not Be Centralized\n\nIn 1913, the great Cambridge mathematician G.H. Hardy received a strange letter with almost indecipherable scrawl. It turned out to be from a destitute young man in India named Srinivasa Ramanujan, who wanted Hardy to look at his work and, in some sense, authenticate it.\n\nAs it turned out, Hardy was one of the only people on the planet who could. It took him some time to go over the papers, and even more time to get over his utter disbelief, but by the end of the day he recognized that Ramanujan, despite his obscurity and complete lack of credentials, was one of the greatest mathematical minds who ever lived.\n\nIn effect, we all have a lesser version of Ramanujan’s problem in that we need recognition to get things that we want. Up till now, that’s been done by centralized institutions, such as banks, credit bureaus, universities and employers, all of which wielded enormous power. The Internet has helped to decentralize many important functions, but in many ways it has also eroded trust.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the role that blockchains, in the form of a trust protocol, can play in the years to come."", 'Zero-fee transactions were the norm in 2011, the exception in 2012, increasingly rare since, and now finally gone. pic.twitter.com/jO9GPlGTiK — Arvind Narayanan (@random_walker) May 15, 2016\n\nThe increasing amounts of Bitcoin transactions have slowly led to an increase in Bitcoin fees as miners favor the transactions with fees as priority transactions. This means that it can take a longer time for a Bitcoin transaction to clear. Some transactions, small ones without fees generally, can be lost to the Bitcoin ether, only to be returned to sender a few day later.\n\nTransaction fees have been touted as one of the best reasons to use Bitcoin. The world’s first truly international value transfer system boasts the lowest transaction fees. Though these fees have been quietly rising over time – and sparked the abovementioned, intense debate about how to keep them low – they remain to this day considerably lower than other value transfer alternatives.\n\nTransaction fees are processed by and received by the Bitcoin miner every time a new Bitcoin block is created. While voluntary, transaction fees can determine how quickly a transaction is processed. By paying transaction fees, a sender provides incentive for a miner to include a transaction into a particular block. Blocks are created each ten minutes approximately. Many wallets, like Bitcoin Core, use floating fees.\n\n21.c0, provider of the above-shown unconfirmed transaction chart, has introduced new ways of plotting Bitcoin transaction fees as of this month available at this website https://bitcoinfees.21.co/, with code discussions at https://bitcoinfees.github.io/.\n\nFor a long time in Bitcoin’s existence, miners would process transactions without fees. All miners today expect transactions to include fees due to the overall volume of the network and to avoid spamming of the Bitcoin network.\n\nRising Bitcoin transaction fees is good for the network. Low transaction fees are unsustainable as they do not provide incentive for miners to continue processing transactions. As Gavin Andresen stated of transaction fees in 2014: “Right now, we have subsidies, so we don’t really need any transaction fees,” he said. “Because of subsidies, miners are willing to mine. But later on, as the subsidy goes away, we definitely need to figure out a balance between miners and users of the network.”\n\nA wire transfer often costs the sender more than $20. Sometimes the receiver is charged. Cheques take a long time to clear, but have no transaction fees. Sometimes, banking institutions charge on cash deposits. It’s illegal to send cash in the mail. It’s easy to see the benefits of sending Bitcoin compared to other ways of sending money, especially internationally. For that reason, rising Bitcoin transaction fees far from portend the death of Bitcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price meanders near its low, apparently acquainting itself with long-term support.

Join now and receive a $29 discount using the code CCN29.\n\nBitcoin Price Fundamentals\n\nTime of analysis: 14h00 UTC\n\nBitstamp 1-Week Candle Chart\n\nToday’s article considers the bitcoin price chart in context of similar speculative markets. The discussion focusses on the notion of fundamentals. The term fundamentals is used in its broadest sense, and not in the strict investment definition that refers to company balance sheets, work in progress, and so on. Although there are parallels between the bitcoin price market and other commodity markets, as briefly explored below, it is not being implied that their broad fundamentals are identical – of course, there are idiosyncrasies – especially with Bitcoin. The discussion will show that there are similar investment and trading psychologies at work.\n\nDo Fundamentals Drive Price?\n\nMany bitcoin holders are wondering how bitcoin price could possibly be declining despite strong protocol fundamentals, surging interest, and a pending supply deflation. Surely, these factors should lead investors to accumulate, or at least hold, bitcoin in anticipation of an imminent rally? Consider that the bulk of daily bitcoin exchange volume is not necessarily transacted by long-term investors, and that forces unrelated to market fundamentals can, and do, motivate a large section of market participants’ decisions.\n\nIt is a widely held belief that fundamentals drive market prices. OPEC imposes a multi-month output quota and the reasonable assumption is that, with demand for oil remaining constant, reduced supply will cause the price of oil to rise. Or the Fed implements a program of quantitative easing, as they did in 2008, and the fundamental implication drives investors, who assume money supply inflation will devalue their dollars, into gold instead.\n\nGold XAU/USD Long-Term Chart\n\nThese are examples of fundamental factors exerting known pushes and pulls on markets. The assumption made in each case, is not incorrect and a causal link between fundamentals and price can be demonstrated. However, fundamentals are not the only influence on market price, nor are they necessarily the strongest influence. Notice how, during the Fed’s most active phase of US dollar inflation, from 2011 to 2014, gold was in a bear market.\n\nSpeculative Markets\n\nMarkets and trade have always been the primary domain for speculation. Some assets and market instruments, due to their inherent difficulty to trade, favor a buy-and-hold (or investment) approach. Property and gold bullion (bars), for example, do not favor quick buying and selling and are best suited to a medium- or long-term investment strategy. Yet, by contrast, almost all commodities futures instruments – and property ETFs – are specifically streamlined to be rapidly bought and sold.\n\nThe ability to rapidly trade in and out of an instrument – at leverage, along with the ability to sell the market short – attracts short-term speculators (both small and large) and results in a price chart with an exaggerated amplitude and, often, volatility. Consider the Coffee Futures market since 1972, for instance:\n\nCoffee Futures Long-Term Chart\n\nSupply and demand dynamics, no-doubt, influenced the price of coffee over the decades, but the long-term chart above is also a fractal of intraday and annual price charts for coffee. In other words, the large price swings are not primarily a result of long-term investment decisions based on the fundamentals of the coffee market. Instead, the coffee chart is strongly influenced by speculative trade that seeks to buy and sell for quick profit.\n\nBitcoin Protocol Fundamentals\n\nBitcoin, the protocol network, has some incredible fundamental characteristics at its core. Most readers are well aware of the obvious, and not-so-obvious, powers inherent in our autonomous genie. To name just a few: censorship resistance, finite money supply, cryptographically secured ownership, mathematically provable consensus, qualified and competent custodianship under an Open Source development model… the list goes on. And Bitcoin’s features are unprecedented, going well beyond descriptions such as “gold 2.0”: programmable money, contracts, trustless payments, the world’s largest super-computer – soon to be augmented by SegWit and Layer 2 payment networks that will outperform VISA on every metric.\n\nThat’s Bitcoin the protocol, the innovation.\n\n[b]itcoin Price Chart\n\nTurning our attention to the protocol’s tokens – bitcoin – and their exchange price, we see all of the usual market forces at play.\n\nSome market participants buy-and-hold for the long-term; some participants are novice traders learning the ropes; some are seasoned traders who favor the bitcoin price chart’s behavior as a “super-commodity”; and, some are large investments institutions that offer investors “paper bitcoin” ETFs. The largest exchanges offer retail traders (non-institutional traders) leveraged trade and bitcoin futures contracts. So the ability to speculate aggressively is incentivised.\n\nWithout any central authority working day-and-night to manipulate its price to stability, and trading freely in the open market, bitcoin price is, therefore, higly volatile and prone to peaks and troughs. All Bitcoin users have, at some point, engaged the common criticism that bitcoin price is “too volatile”. And we know that the statement is pure hokum – bitcoin price volatility is not a fundamental bug, it’s an expected open market feature.\n\nGoing Up…\n\nNaturally, every speculator buys to eventually sell. Some do so from year to year, some from day to day and often in large amounts. Hence, the bitcoin price chart behaves like a commodity – not because the CFTC says so – but because it attracts both long-term and short-term speculators, all of them eager for profit, and we see the results of their activity in the chart.\n\n…Going Down\n\nFast-paced rallies and sell-offs (profit taking) are regularly followed by protracted consolidation periods. The fundamental strengths that underpin the Bitcoin protocol give it social, political, and technological value. We expect to see the steady economic valuation of Bitcoin to continue growing in the bitcoin price chart, while acknowledging that powerful, yet, unavoidable speculative forces will keep the chart swinging between price extremes.\n\nAfterthoughts\n\nAs acknowledged at the top of the article, fundamentals do have a long-term effect on price and value of an asset or instrument. The discussion above points out the pervasive and constant influence of speculation in liquid markets. There are many schools of thought that seek to understand – and answer – the question “What drives speculation?” This topic will be explored in the coming weeks.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price is sticking close to long-term support near $434 (Bitstamp). There is no guarantee that the market will hold its nerve at this chart structure, establish support, and build the next wave of advance. The actual reward halving is still two months away – a long time in market terms – and a lot of water will still be drawn from the well.\n\nRepeated failure at advance may cause potential buyers to wait for others to do the work of buying price to above $470 resistance. This dynamic could see a base develop above $430. However, if a lack of advance leads a portion of the market to impatiently sell bitcoin in order to invest in more profitable markets, or perhaps change into the newly appreciating US dollar, the bottom can easily drop out below $430.\n\nBitfinex Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin-price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

Ethereum support has already been confirmed, and it seems very likely Litecoin will be added as well. But what does this mean for Bitcoin?\n\nIs GDAX Pivoting Away From Bitcoin?\n\nThat seems to be the primary question on everybody’s mind. Brian Armstrong, the GDAX CEO, has made some interesting remarks about Bitcoin in the past, which may cause some people to question his loyalty to the cryptocurrency which put his company on the map. While everybody is entitled to their opinion, one would not expect certain remarks from a Bitcoin company CEO.\n\nIn March of this year, Armstrong went as far as calling the Bitcoin Core developers “the biggest systemic risk” this cryptocurrency has faced to date. This particular remark was made after the GDAX CEO attended the Satoshi Roundtable meeting at the end of February, which did not present an immediate solution to the ongoing Bitcoin block size debate.\n\nBrian Armstrong wrote the following in a blog post:\n\n“The conversations initially focused on various compromises to kick the can down the road on scalability. But as the conversations went on, I became less and less concerned about what short term solution we pick because I realized we all had a much bigger problem:the systemic risk to bitcoin if Bitcoin Core was the only team working on bitcoin.”\n\nBut that was not the only gripe the GDAX CEO has with the Bitcoin Core developers, as he strongly felt it was their fault and their fault alone we have gotten to this point in time. He even predicted a potential negative spiral as far as the Bitcoin price is concerned, unless a proper solution was found quickly.\n\n“The fact that bitcoin core has allowed the network to reach this point is incredibly negligent, and I think says a lot about their motivations and competency as a team. There is no reason to roll the dice and see if this failure scenario comes to fruition.”\n\nWhile these comments have not sparked any significant debate over the past five to six weeks, they are popping up once again now that GDAX will add support for Ethereum. A lot of Bitcoin enthusiasts feel Armstrong is turning his back on Bitcoin in doing so, although the support for Ethereum makes sense from a business point of view.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there are growing rumors regarding GDAX adding support for Litecoin as well. While it makes sense to do so if platform users demand it, Litecoin has not seen any significant changes over the past few years. Die-hard enthusiasts are still using the cryptocurrency to pay for goods and services, though.\n\nIn the end, a lot of people seem to question Armstrong’s decision. The rebranding to GDAX seems to shy away from the term “Bitcoin”, and the support for two cryptocurrencies that are completely different is a cause for debate. At the same time, it appears as if Armstrong just wants his company to succeed, and that means it is impossible to please everybody at the same time.\n\nHeader image courtesy of NewsBTC', 'What effect will the July 11 halving have on the Bitcoin’s value? As many worry that mining becomes less profitable, some experts take a different view.\n\nMost Bitcoin users believe that the pending halving in July will have an effect on the cryptocurrency’s value. Speculations are rife that Bitcoin mining activities will be less profitable afterwards especially for big miners which will extend to individuals who have mining contracts. Some say the small miners will also suffer.\n\nA debate about the topic appeared in a bitcointalk.org discussion thread which has two separate quotes from Genesis Mining. A first post by EBK1000 in response to a miner was the following:\n\n""We know the halving will be a topic, but we cannot predict what will happen. We can’t even predict the next difficulty change due to the nature of cryptocurrency and its daily changes. But just one thought, when the mining reward will halve, also the need for BTC will increase due to expanding companies and the value of BTC will increase, and this not on minor numbers. Best regards, Tom, Genesis Mining""\n\nIn his next post he says:\n\n""If all else remains the same then mining would probably not be profitable anymore. But as said, nothing ever stays the same and effects of the (coming) halving are not known. Value can rise or drop, people can stop mining, making difficulty go down, more people could be mining it for value reasons, and so on.""\n\nMining worries\n\n“This halving is different from the previous because when the first one happened,” says Tim Akinbo, CEO of Nigeria-based TimbaObjects to CoinTelegraph, “most people mining Bitcoins were hobbyists. Today we have people mining as a commercial operation with millions of dollars in investment.”\n\nHe says that most mining operations are barely profitable now and if the Bitcoin price remains the same when the halving occurs, then a lot of mining operations will become unprofitable.\n\n“For them to remain in business,” he adds, “Bitcoin\'s price will have to increase by 100% for the effect to be non-existent. I don\'t think that\'s going to happen. When you have a barely profitable operation and then you take a 50% cut in revenue, most mining operations will shut down. That will not necessarily make Bitcoin less secure because it will lead to more decentralisation of the mining process.”\n\nBincoin already priced it\n\nOthers don’t think any loss would be incurred as a result of the halving.\n\ngkv9 writes:\n\n“Look, when the price of BTC was $200 and miners were mining, just think why did they mine... It was just because mining was profitable with the reward of BTC25 when the price was $200, so if we see it correctly, the price is currently double the previous one, and so it can be said that BTC is already priced in before halving so that miners may actually profit in future too, though they are still accumulating for any further losses which might occur (possible) but I don\'t think that with this price, you might see any loss even with halved rewards…”\n\nLower power consumption an answer\n\nChina’s Bitbank shares the same view. The mining company is confident that the halving will not change the industry’s long-term growth outlook to affect its profit.\n\nThe Shenzhen-based company is even looking to raise 3500 BTC via crowdfunding to build a new mining factory with a promise of a 100% ROI plus interest for principal investors.\n\nIts head of international operations Virgilio Lizardo Jr tells CoinTelegraph that the halving has been factored into the company’s business plan for over a year.\n\n“For example, Bitbank has recently adjusted its daily unfixed and 3 months fixed interest wallet rates to prepare for the halving.”\n\nHe added that “the company will bank on its plans to use ‘the world’s only 14nm miners’ which, with the co-operation of its sister company BW, are expected to produce an output of around 30 petahash of hashing power.”\n\n“The 14nm miner offers maximum performance with low power consumption and is built to have an industry leading lifetime of 24 months,” Lizardo Jr wrote.\n\nValidation will continue\n\nBy July 11, Akinbo’s prophecy that some big miners will shut down would be confirmed - or not.\n\n“That\'s going to be the effect if the price doesn\'t appreciate as fast as the effect of the halving,” he said. “So if you\'re a big miner, that\'s the only time you get concerned about the halving. For regular users, not so much. As long as someone has mining equipment out there, Bitcoin transactions will continue to be validated.”\n\nThe growth of the Bitcoin-mining industry in China may be a big factor in its global perspectives, and one of the indicators is the last Bitbank’s successful crowdfund sale.\n\n“We actively monitor other jurisdictions to follow the development of what works and doesn’t to help our local officials craft informed regulations in our market. Due to these factors, Bitbank is confident in the long term growth of the Bitcoin industry in China,” he says.', 'Jason Leibowitz is a former Wall Street professional who pivoted careers in 2014 to focus full-time on digital currency.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Leibowitz discusses why the blockchain is now best perceived as an innovation in distributed, digital trust, despite its early connotations with the financial technology space.\n\nIt’s been referred to as a ""revolutionary technology"" by IBM, and a ""once in a generation opportunity"" by PricewaterhouseCoopers. But perhaps the most descriptive title came from The Economist when they dubbed blockchain ""the trust machine"".\n\nIt is a breakthrough in computer science that holds the promise of reducing the cost of establishing and maintaining trust for both individuals and organizations.\n\n""Blockchain"" is a relatively new term that refers to a specific type of computer database. The Oxford English Dictionary defines blockchain as ""a digital ledger in which transactions…are recorded chronologically and publicly"". The etymology dates back to 2008 when the creator of the cryptocurrency ""bitcoin"" called its ledger a ""blockchain"", or a chain consisting of blocks of transactions.\n\nSince then, there have been many competing versions and iterations, but most operate on the same premise: they are open-sourced, run 24x7 and continuously update in real-time.\n\nWhat makes blockchain technology unique and groundbreaking is that it\'s not controlled by any single entity; instead the ledgers are distributed among all parties involved (also referred to as a ""distributed ledger""). This means that no central party has ownership of the ledger, therefore no one can individually amend the entries already on a blockchain.\n\nThis makes the blockchain an immutable store of information.\n\nRemoving intermediaries\n\nOne of the primary values of blockchains in business is the role they assume by disintermediating middlemen.\n\nBecause blockchains are decentralized and immutable, counterparties can independently transact and verify the data on a ledger without the need to hire costly third parties to perform similar tasks. Often the role of third parties is to add trust and integrity to transactions, especially between unknowns.\n\nFor example, in real estate transactions, escrow companies act as one of the many third parties who sit between the buyer and seller to collect fees for the service of exchanging funds for documents. On a blockchain, individuals and businesses would be able to transact directly, peer-to-peer.\n\n""Standard practices that normally involve specialists, like title searches, legal, finance, etc will be less needed or in most cases totally unnecessary. [Using blockchains] the speed to transact will be shortened from days/weeks/months to minutes or seconds”, explains Jason Ray, CTO of the Urban Land Institute, a global real estate body.\n\nThe application of this technology in real estate will make waves by increasing transparency, expediting lengthy processes and overall reducing the costs of transacting.\n\nAchieving trust\n\nOver $1bn of venture capital money has already been invested in blockchain-related companies around the world. Leading-edge businesses and investors across many industries have begun to recognize that this technology holds the key to revolutionizing the way money, assets and securities are transferred, accounted for and reconciled.\n\nThe goal is to harness blockchain technology to save time and money for businesses and their customers — the product of which will be increased trust and transparency in many currently opaque industries. One beneficiary will be the financial markets, where the pricing of complex derivative instruments (exotic options on securities, equities and commodities), including those on mortgage-backed securities, contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nTrust is the key element of blockchain technology. When transactions are executed and settled on a distributed ledger, counterparties don\'t need to have an established trust relationship. If each participant in the transaction trusts the blockchain itself then they don’t need to directly trust each other. This opens up new avenues of customers for businesses operating on blockchains.\n\nHere is a real-world example in the insurance industry:\n\nSafeShare Global is a modern insurance company that has a unique edge: they employ blockchain technology to offer affordable insurance solutions specifically designed for the sharing economy. Companies such as AirBnB and Vrumi allow users to rent out space to interested parties, however, this means the hosts need to be comfortable letting complete strangers into their homes.\n\nThis is where insurance plays an important role: to protect the hosts from potential liabilities. (It is important to note that typical home insurance policies do not cover individuals or families when using residences as unregistered quasi-hotels, which forces space sharing companies to offer their own insurance).\n\nVrumi, a startup launched in 2014, has partnered with SafeShare Global because they cannot afford to self-insure like some of their competitors. Once a Vrumi host and renter are matched, and the host opts-in for insurance through the website, the material information about the policy gets directly uploaded onto a distributed ledger. At this point all logistics are essentially automated as Vrumi, SafeShare, the underwriter and all other parties involved behind the scenes simultaneously receive and can view the time-stamped information about each policy.\n\nThe use of a distributed ledger eliminates the need for these companies to employ labor-intensive middle and back offices to handle the details and coordination of each policy. What differentiates this from a typical database is the immutable and distributed aspect of the ledger. No one can amend or duplicate policy information, otherwise fraudulent policies would immediately be visible by all parties running the ledger.\n\nThe transparency of this distributed ledger virtually eliminates fraud, which further reduces the costs of doing business for all parties involved.\n\nEarly adopters grow\n\nOne of the parties running a node on this ledger is a UK governing body called the States of Alderney. While not necessary, they are adding an air of legitimacy to this pilot insurance program. To be fair, the relevant reason for the government’s involvement is to help protect one of their oldest insurance companies who has taken on the responsibility of underwriting SafeShare’s policies: Lloyd’s of London.\n\nLloyd’s has been vocal about their willingness to embrace new technologies to help streamline the insurance industry. Its director of operations, Shirine Khoury-Haq, elaborated that ""blockchain has the potential to improve the way insurers record risk, increasing the speed, accuracy and transparency of our processes.""\n\nLloyd’s recognized that once they approved of the way SafeShare’s distributed ledger operated, they were ready to enter into business with the startup. Expressed differently, Lloyd’s just needed to place trust in the blockchain and not directly in SafeShare itself to enter into this business relationship.\n\nBlockchain technology adds transparency because it is essentially an open window into the inner workings of a business. Without the use of blockchain technology, Lloyd’s would have to trust the methodology in which SafeShare goes about its business, without any direct insight into the integrity of their operations. Blockchain technology reduces the barriers to entry for new market participants like SafeShare because the transparent nature of distributed ledgers means it is much harder for businesses to hide any dubious practices.\n\nThe blockchain-inspired relationship between all parties involved in this example is a microcosm of the impact that distributed ledgers will have on the overall economy. Successful new innovations generally save users either time or money, or they add convenience.\n\nBlockchains do all three, and the applications of this technology have only just scratched the surface of their full potential.\n\nOther implementations of the technology are currently found in banking, healthcare, notaries, digital rights, provenance and the Internet of Things. As the reach of blockchain continues to grow, more industries will feel the disruptive impact of this innovation in trust.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Medium and has been republished here with the author\'s permission.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Drug Task Force arrested a student at East Stroudsburg University in East Stroudsburg, Pa. for selling drugs from his dorm room which he purchased on the darknet, according to darkwebnews.com.\n\nAuthorities claim the student, Michael Mancini, used and sold LSD that he bought on the darknet.\n\nMancini reportedly accessed the darknet using the Tor browser and bought the drugs with bitcoin. The darknet requires specialized access since the websites are not indexed by commonly used search engines.\n\nStudent Admits His Actions\n\nMancini admitted purchasing LSD on the darknet 10 times and selling it to eight other students. He said he sold the drug for $9 a hit.\n\nPolice arrested Mancini and charged him with purchasing a controlled substance, possession with intent to distribute a banned drug, use of a communication facility for criminal purchases, a misdemeanor, and other charges.\n\nMancini was later released on an unsecured $20,000 bail, according to records.\n\nAuthorities became suspicious after a second drug delivery to Mancini.\n\nThe university police responded to an informant who claimed Mancini was frequently ordering LSD on the web. William Parrish, the university police chief, received reports that Mancini frequently accessed the darknet to purchase LSD.\n\nThe informant further claimed Mancini displayed how to order a hit man on the darknet.\n\nThe Drugs Came From Hawaii\n\nThe university police were informed about Mancini’s activities after a resident director at the university intercepted a letter from Fun Stuff LLC in Wailuku, Hawaii that was intended for Mancini. The package was addressed to the student’s room in Lenape Hall.\n\nThe resident director then facilitated communication between the informant and the police.\n\nParrish contacted the local task force, as well as Kim Lippincott, the narcotics detective, according to the Monroe County, Pa. district attorney’s office.\n\nAlso read: Juvenile ran online drug empire from bedroom, got paid in bitcoin\n\nPolice Search Student’s Room\n\nDetectives obtained a search warrant and searched the student’s room. They found a plastic bag containing LSD-saturated squares. They also found Mancini’s cell phone, drug paraphernalia, a plastic bag, flavored cigars, a glass device for smoking marijuana, and a computer. Mancini was in the room during the search.\n\nThe LSD came in 2-inch squares, each of which contained 12 doses, according to the report. The bag was labeled, “Mint Condition” and included more than 25 hits.\n\nThe drug was pressed into a perforated paper between a pair of collector cards. A field test determined the paper was saturated with LSD.\n\nMancini contacted his friends on his cell phone and arranged for them to receive the drugs.\n\nDarknet websites use encryption software that allows individuals who log in to hide their locations.

05/22/2016,"['Max Kordek is a 24-year-old Bitcoin wiz from Germany. Next week he and his co-founder, 37-year-old Oliver Beddows, will launch their company, Lisk.\n\nAnd Lisk is such an exciting idea that during their 30-day crowdfunding campaign, nearly 4,000 people chipped in a total of $6 million in bitcoin to fund their seed round, Kordek tells Business Insider.\n\nLisk is two things: a new kind of app store, and a new form of internet money, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nAn app that never goes down\n\nFirst and foremost, Lisk is a new kind of app store built on the same kind of technology used by Bitcoin to keep track of who owns how many coins.\n\nThat\'s a technology known as blockchain, which the tech and financial industries are going gaga for.\n\nIn simple terms, blockchain is a distributed database, an app that is replicated on many, many computer servers that keeps track of transactions.\n\nIn practice it means that Lisk will also use many different clouds, Kordek says.\n\n""There are many different servers. Some might be at Amazon, some might be at Google or Digital Ocean and many other hosting and server providers. And developers can install Lisk on their own servers and their computer participates. This is what makes the network,"" he says.\n\nAll of this means the app store can never go down, Kordek says.\n\nBut there\'s a few other things this app store will do. Security and privacy are built in. It won\'t be able to mine users\' data, letting people keep their data private.\n\nInstead, the app store will focus on paid apps. The app developer can take a fraction of each financial transaction that takes place.\n\nFor instance, if a developer builds an app that lets coffee shops sell cups of coffee by subscription, every time a customer uses the app and money changes hands, the developer takes a tiny fraction of the Lisk coin that changes hands.\n\nA new kind of internet coin\n\nSecond, Lisk is a new kind of internet money, similar to Bitcoin. All forms of this kind of internet money are called ""cryptocurrency"" and while Bitcoin is the most famous and most valuable, there are currently 100 of them listed on CoinMarketCap, a site that tracks the value of such currencies.\n\nKordek had to build a new cryptocurrency in order for the financial exchange part of his app-store network to work fast enough to run an app.\n\n""Bitcoin is very slow. You have to wait 10 minutes for every transaction. Our own network, with our own cryptocurrency, you have to wait 10 seconds,"" he says.\n\nIn fact, its crowdfunding campaign sold off the first batch of Lisk coins.\n\nKordek believes that many of the people that invested were less interested in the app store, and just ""speculating on"" the price of the new coin, he says. That\'s what happened with a cryptocoin called Ethereum, he notes.\n\nThat\'s the second most valuable coin after bitcoin. Ethereum was also launched via a crowdfunding campaign in 2014. Today a single Ether is worth $14 and Ethereum has a market cap of $1.1 billion.\n\nLisk also made another promise to investors. The $6 million worth of Bitcoin raised was put into escrow, meaning the cofounders can\'t touch it to hire people or pay for bills until they launch their app store and network.\n\n""The money is locked up. We\'re running on our savings and I’m 24 years old, so my savings are not unlimited,"" he says.\n\nLisk founders never met\n\nKordek and Beddows got the idea for Lisk from the Crypti Foundation, the previous company where they worked, which was developing a similar kind of app store.\n\nKordek lives in Aachen, Germany. Beddows lives in the UK.\n\n""It\'s strange but we are somehow always on the same page, have the same opinion about things, we just understand ourselves so well. It\'s crazy,"" Kordek says.\n\nSince Crypti was releasing all of its code as open source software, Kordek and Beddows took many parts of the Crypti\'s code as a basis for Lisk.\n\nTheir decision to go out on their own apparently caused a bit of a firestorm in that part of the cryptocurrency world. But in the end Crypti announced on its blog that it was winding down the project anyway. Its founders said they supported Lisk and would soon be turning the project over to its community of users to use and update as they pleased.\n\nTheir history caused another odd situation. Despite working together for years, the two cofounders have never actually met in person.\n\n""We will actually meet at the end of May beginning of June. We will go to an event hosted by a big venture capitalist, and meet the first time. We thought about creating an office in Berlin but he has a wife and I have family as well, so we decided to stay decentralized in the spirit of our network,"" Kordek says.\n\nThe history of Crypti demonstrates that Lisk, as a company, is still a long shot.\n\nBut this idea that the next generation app store will be built on blockchain, whether by Lisk or someone else, seems increasingly likely.\n\nCorrection: This story originally reported that Max Kordek lives in Berlin when he lives in Aachen.', ""In the beginning the Prophet Satoshi brought us Bitcoin. And the cryptogeeks and libertarians looked upon it, and said lo, we smile upon this, for it is good, and decentralized, and solves the Byzantine Generals Problem. For a time all was well. But then came wailing and gnashing of teeth and wearing of sackcloth. And then came the Prophet Vitalik, bearing Ethereum; and lo, it was even better.\n\nMaybe.\n\nThere appears to be a severe outbreak of Ethereum Fever south of Market. — Parker Thompson (@pt) May 20, 2016\n\nWhat is Ethereum? It’s a combination of a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, and a vast decentralized computer. Let me explain. As an above-average TechCrunch reader, you already know Bitcoin is a currency whose transactions are secured by the immense computing power of its distributed network of “miners,” rather than any central entity. But you may not appreciate that every Bitcoin transaction is actually a program written in the Bitcoin scripting language — aka a “smart contract.”\n\nBitcoin’s contractual language is quite limited, by design. But it allows for transactions that can be delayed until a particular time; or transactions that occur only if, say, 3 of 5 signatories agree to them; or crowdfunding campaigns that only transfer money if a particular total is attained; and many other possibilities. Importantly, once incorporated into the Bitcoin blockchain, these contracts require no trust and no human intervention. Bitcoin is programmable money … with a highly restrictive programming language.\n\nEthereum removes those restrictions entirely. The Ethereum scripting language is Turing-complete, meaning it can replicate any program written in any traditional programming language. However, to prevent ill-behaved contracts with infinite loops from running forever, every Ethereum transaction computation must be paid for. Just as Bitcoin miners collect small amounts of bitcoin, known as “fees,” in exchange for mining transactions onto the Bitcoin blockchain, Ethereum miners collect “ether,” the Ethereum currency, for running Ethereum contracts.\n\nYou may well be thinking: “Oh come on. Bitcoin was more than abstruse and geeky enough. Now this new made-up-magical-money thing is even more complicated? Why should I care?”\n\nYou should care because decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are–or at least could be–essentially an Internet for money, securities, and other contractual transactions. Like the Internet, they are permissionless networks that anyone can join and use. Ethereum optimists might analogize Bitcoin as the FTP of this transactional Internet, with Ethereum as its World Wide Web.\n\nI’ve waxed about why I think Bitcoin matters. I’m a little less enthusiastic about Ethereum … so far. To be clear: as I’ve written before, Ethereum is really cool, truly innovative, and potentially revolutionary. However, it is now–probably–at the peak of its initial hype cycle.\n\nConsider: heavily funded Bitcoin startup Coinbase will soon support Ethereum trading on its rebranded cryptocurrency exchange. Microsoft offers “Ethereum Blockchain As A Service” on Azure. Ether has risen in value more than tenfold over the last year, to a market cap which now exceeds $1 billion. And while Bitcoin’s hashrate, a measure of the computing power devoted to mining, still vastly exceeds Ethereum’s, look at the hockey-stick nature of that latter chart.\n\nMost of all, though, consider the DAO, and the $163 million — $163 million! — it has raised. Sorry: I mean “raised.”\n\nWhat is the DAO? It stands for “Decentralized Autonomous Organization.” Ethereum offers a tutorial explaining how to create your own. The DAO, however, as Seth Bannon explained on TC recently, is a particular DAO which:\n\nas of the time of writing, controls more than $100 million in assets, and yet it exists entirely on the Ethereum blockchain. In exchange for supporting The DAO financially (in the form of Ether), backers get DAO tokens, which they can then use to vote on the direction of the organization. They can use their tokens to vote on big governance issues (akin to traditional shareholders) but also on minute details of how The DAO spends its resources. In this way, token holders have total control over The DAO’s assets and its actions. People with projects they’d like to build for The DAO can submit ideas in the form of a proposal written in plain English accompanied by smart contract code. The code automatically executes payments so long as certain agreed-upon conditions are met. Because this is all built on top of Ethereum, which allows for robust smart contracts, this can all be done autonomously.\n\nOr as Peter Vessenes put it:\n\nIt’s a cross between a crowdfunding site and a venture capital / private equity partnership. It’s controlled by a set of voting rules encapsulated and enforced on the Ethereum blockchain as a smart contract. People that trust the code, rules and plan are sending ether directly to fund the contract. […] If a certain percentage decide to fund a proposal, then it’s funded.\n\nThink of it as a kind of corporation incorporated only on the Ethereum blockchain, whose laws consist entirely of those defined by its contract code. A corporation that appears to be a means of investing in the future … without having any concrete idea exactly what that future is yet. For many people, that kind of investment is a holy grail.\n\nBut if this sounds to you like a poor fit with existing legal and regulatory structures, and/or a disaster waiting to happen, well, you’re certainly not alone:\n\nWhat's the future of the DAO? Regulators nuking it, of course. https://t.co/C0I1cmDCQF — Josh Myer (@xek) May 17, 2016\n\nTo quote Eris COO (and attorney) Preston Byrne:\n\nthe plain-English covenants made on funding proposals, the absence of legal certainty as to what THEDAO actually is and the nebulous and ever-shifting nature of THEDAO’s “membership,” will make it very difficult to properly assign ownership in these projects’ work product. #THEDAO might look and feel like a company, but on cursory examination, too many gaps, too few formalities, not enough structure and legally incorrect methods reveal themselves as fatal to the exercise. […] I sympathise with THEDAO’s intentions, in that I believe that the financial markets are currently rigged against the “little guy” and that there is no reason why the kinds of investment opportunities (and returns) available to the super-wealthy should not be available to small investors whose traditional means of accumulating wealth (savings) are all but useless given current, zero interest-rate monetary policy. I also believe that blockchain tech will one day play a role in facilitating more democratic access to the capital markets. However, the current body of laws governing this sphere of conduct exists to ensure that people to whom investments are marketed can be absolutely certain about what they’re getting in exchange for their money. In this respect THEDAO clearly falls very short of the mark.\n\nYes. ALSO possible to imagine a (not legally suspect) DAO that isn't a crapcoin disaster. Sad if this sets us back https://t.co/whBz5sEMKX — Michael Casey (@mikejcasey) May 18, 2016\n\nIts worth noting that the money the DAO has “raised” is essentially refundable. As Bitshares founder and DAO skeptic Dan Larimer puts it:\n\nThe DAO has tentatively raised $100 million dollars worth of ETH, but so far the investors have taken no real risk. Every single person who has purchased DAO tokens has the ability to reclaim their ETH so long as they never vote. The end result is a massive marketing campaign that totally misrepresents what has been invested and what hasn’t. Considering there is no real risk being taken beyond the risk of holding ETH and that there is the potential for a large gain it is no wonder so many people have participated.\n\nSo let’s all try to damp down the hype just a bit. Right now all we have are headlines, promises, and a lot of “raised” money which has not actually been committed. Let’s wait for the results, if any — legal and otherwise — to roll in before declaring the DAO revolution underway. Because, I mean, I like hype too, but this is getting more than a little ridiculous.\n\nThat said, the DAO does serve to illustrate that these are fecund, exciting times for Ethereum. I’m not worried about the hype; that gets in everywhere. What most concerns me about the Ethereum project is security.\n\nEthereum is planning a transition from proof-of-work security (mining) to proof-of-stake security. There are very good reasons to do this, but proof-of-work, for all its flaws and excesses, is simple and thoroughly tested. Ethereum’s “Casper” proof-of-stake mechanism is fascinating; but if it has a serious undiscovered flaw, the entire network is at risk.\n\nSimilarly, one reason Bitcoin’s scripting language is limited is to help prevent hacking and denial-of-service attacks on the Bitcoin network and its miners. There’s no denying that Ethereum offers a vastly larger attack surface than Bitcoin does.\n\nWorse yet, this applies not just to the network itself, but to individual Ethereum contracts. As Vessenes puts it: “Ethereum Contracts Are Going To Be Candy For Hackers.” To quote the ensuing, and surprisingly good, Hacker News discussion: “Running a machine on a blockchain (Ethereum) is much more complex and error prone then recording transactions on a blockchain (bitcoin.)”\n\nI hope this doesn’t sound too pessimistic. I am genuinely excited about Ethereum in the medium to long term, and you should be too. But I also think we’re now at the peak of its first hype cycle, and important lessons need to be learned, hopefully the easy way, before it begins to achieve its revolutionary potential. There is a reason that “may you live in interesting times” is deemed a curse."", 'Kanishka Sukumar, a consultant who works in midtown Manhattan, says his parents often stash money in gold for safekeeping. But the 24-year-old thinks there is a better place for his savings.\n\n""In times of financial turmoil, I would prefer to see a portfolio full of bitcoin,” said Mr. Sukumar, who holds about one-third of his wealth in the...', 'The Bitcoin network is weighed down by increasing number of transactions over the blockchain. Thanks to the smaller block size of 1 MB, which has not been upgraded since the days of Bitcoin’s creation. The increased load on the network has led to delays in confirmation of transactions. Miners have started to give priority to transactions with higher miner fee, leading to an increase in the average miner fee per transaction.\n\nThe increasing transaction fees make micro-transactions over the Bitcoin network virtually impossible. At the same time, those who are prone to making a large number of bitcoin transactions will end up paying a lot in transaction fees. In order to overcome these issues, 21 Inc. has implemented micropayment channels, that are designed to handle a large number of transactions between two parties without having all the transactions confirmed over the blockchain as long as the channel is kept open between the two wallet addresses.\n\nThe average miner free for faster confirmation on the blockchain currently stands at about 40 satoshis per byte. Each bitcoin transaction is about 250-256 bytes, which will put the average bitcoin transaction fee at around 10,000 satoshis or more, equivalent to $0.04. The graph on 21 Inc.’s bitcoin fees predictor shows the average time taken to confirm the digital transactions on the blockchain based on the assigned miner fee.\n\nBitcoin fee predictor uses blockchain data from the past three hours while factoring in the unconfirmed transactions in the mempool to present a chart of average transaction time, miner fee, and block delay.\n\nThe micropayments channel allows bitcoin users to overcome this hassle by recording all the transactions happening over the channel just twice over the blockchain. Similar to opening a tab on a credit card in your favorite bar, the micropayment channel will record a transaction once the channel is created, by locking a certain amount of bitcoin for future transaction over the channel using OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and each payment can be signed by the sender, with an option for the receiver to withdraw the signed amount whenever he/she wishes or wait till the micropayment channel is closed to receive the transaction amount. The largest transaction chunk on the channel will be broadcasted to be recorded on the blockchain.\n\nIn order to execute all the transactions happening over the Micropayment Channel, multiple local versions of the transactions are created, which will be broadcasted to the blockchain one after all the transactions are received. The recipient should broadcast the payments to the blockchain before the expiry of time lock period. Otherwise, the locked funds will become available for spending.\n\nMicropayment channels will help reduce the cost and time and cost associated with multiple transactions over the blockchain. It is similar to the Lightning Network, proposed to be implemented into the Bitcoin core in the coming days.\n\nRef: BitcoinFees21 Image: NewsBTC', 'Bitcoin price wallows near a 15-month support line near $434.

My understanding of the actual technological aspects of them is somewhat limited, so forgive the fact that this analogy inevitably has its own limitations, but I hereby present it to you - the glass deposit box analogy.\n\nAddresses, keys and the Blockchain\n\nOne of the first things people ask me when I talk to them about Bitcoin is, ‘if it’s on a computer, what’s to stop someone ‘copying and pasting’ Bitcoin?’ An explanation that wallets hold private keys to public addresses often leaves people confused, so this was the first idea I wanted to confront.\n\nImagine an enormous 24/7 bank vault. The vault is filled with row upon row of unlabelled deposit boxes. However, each deposit box has a glass frontage, allowing anyone and everyone to view the contents of the deposit box, but not access it. When someone opens a new deposit box, they are given a key that is unique to that box. Making a copy of the key doesn’t double the contents of the box. By the same token, although you own that deposit box, you don’t technically own it, per se, in that it is not in your possession, you merely possess the ability to access its contents at any time.\n\nThis is fundamentally how Bitcoin and the Blockchain works. Anyone and everyone can see the contents of everyone else’s Bitcoin addresses. There is no information tying people to their addresses, but everyone is aware of the existence of every address. When someone opens a Bitcoin wallet, they are creating a new address on the Blockchain and the private key that ‘unlocks’ that address. In this way, you can’t ‘copy and paste’ Bitcoin because all you would be doing is making a copy of a key as the wallet on your computer does not actually hold the Bitcoin.\n\nTransactions and beyond\n\nThis is where the analogy wavers slightly - the task of conveying the fact that transactions are all publicly accessible and anyone can see that Bitcoin has been transferred from one ‘deposit box’ to another, yet still no one’s identity is revealed is somewhat tricky. I’d love to see your thoughts in the comments about how this could be resolved and how the analogy can be developed further, or if you just hate the analogy altogether - that’s fine too.', 'Bitcoin is moving toward the target of the long-term correction within the upward trend. The ending of that rebound could provoke a continuation of the long-term trend and a turn to decline.\n\nWhen will the current rebound end?\n\nBitcoin’s price is fulfilling its minimal correction targets at around $440. As there was no turn to decline on a long-term scope, the downward movement is limited. One confirmation of that is the stop around $440.\n\nA change of cycles usually happens at points like that. Now the market has to decide whether to continue its long-term trend or form a turn to decline. The $442.2 resistance we discovered earlier, at which several key instruments intersected, will be the mark where an upward scenario could play out. For that, the price has to fortify at the level of $442 and form a turn to growth. If that is the case, Bitcoin’s price will at least return to its long-term flat. The minimal upper target, where the price may stop, is the diagonal channel and the accumulated volume at $455. The $455 resistance could become the peak of a new wave of a flat, as the majority of traders are likely to open their deals there. In case of a downward scenario, Bitcoin’s price will yet again have to rebound from the $442 resistance. That will be the first signal of the formation of a deeper correction. After that, there will be a need for a confirmation of the bears holding advantage in the form of the price fortifying below $435. In that case, the odds will be on the side of a downward trend.\n\nThe fate of the long-term trend will be decided at the level of $442.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'A lawyer at Anderson Kill, PC in Washington, DC, Stephen D Palley (@palleylaw) focuses his law practice on construction, insurance and software development, including blockchain and smart contract design. The opinions in this article are Palley’s alone, are not intended to be legal advice, and may not be shared by past, present or future clients or any firm with which he is associated.\n\nIn this op-ed, Palley explores the question of liability and jurisdiction in the context of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n\nDoes distributed presence create distributed liability? Does participation in a blockchain based decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) subject you to worldwide liability? While a one-sized fits all rule isn\'t possible, it may help to understand what jurisdiction means and how Courts acquire it.[1]\n\n(If you\'re trying to understand why this even matters, you\'ll find this author\'s views on the subject in an earlier post titled ""How to Sue a DAO"").\n\n1. What is jurisdiction anyway?\n\nJurisdiction refers to a Court\'s authority to apply laws to disputes between parties and to do so in a way that can be enforced. (My old legal dictionary is even pithier: it\'s ""the power to hear and determine a case"").[2]\n\nLegal liability (distributed or not) can only be established by a Court that has jurisdiction. Enforceable legal liability presupposes jurisdiction.\n\nIn the US, the Constitution and a variety of statutes define the scope of Court\'s jurisdiction and describe the kinds of disputes that they can adjudicate. (I\'m a U.S. lawyer, so I do draw on U.S. legal principles, though I imagine that jurisdiction is a threshold requirement in most places).\n\nWhat do Courts do? As Justice Marshall famously (to lawyers, anyway) and carefully put it in Marbury v. Madison:\n\n""It is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases must, of necessity, expound and interpret that rule.""\n\nIn short, US Courts interpret, expound, and apply laws. They rely upon the Executive Branch to carry out and enforce their judgments. (For example, US Marshals work for the Department of Justice, which is within the Executive Branch).\n\nNext, some basic jurisdiction concepts and terms.\n\n2. Subject matter jurisdiction\n\nThe threshold jurisdictional requirement I discussed above is sometimes called ""subject matter jurisdiction.""\n\nFor example, ""diversity jurisdiction"" is one type of subject matter jurisdiction US Federal Courts exercise. It allows a Court to decide certain kinds of disputes between parties where the plaintiffs and defendants are not citizens or residents of the same state and the amount in controversy is greater than $75,000, exclusive of fees, costs and interest. There\'s more to it, of course, and it can also apply to non-US parties. (See 28 U.S.C 1332. This is just one example, and there are many other kinds of Federal Court subject matter jurisdiction).[3]\n\nSimilarly, if you want to sue someone in small claims court in Washington, DC, the amount in controversy has to be less than $5,000. The court doesn\'t have subject matter jurisdiction over disputes in excess of $5,000.\n\nNutshell: courts have to have subject matter jurisdiction to resolve disputes or find someone liable. While it may be true in practice that anyone can sue anyone for anything, or try to do so, Courts don\'t have unlimited subject matter jurisdiction, at least not U.S. Courts.\n\nSo if you\'re in DAO and you\'re wondering about liability and U.S. Courts\' jurisdiction, the first thing you have to figure out is how, if or why a Court would have subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n3. Scope of subject matter jurisdiction\n\nNeither parties nor courts can manufacture subject matter jurisdiction. Here\'s what happened in a civil case that I once handled:\n\nThe case involved a dispute over a contract between (1) a company that was a citizen of state X and (2) a company that was a citizen of country Y.\n\nThe parties had agreed to a forum selection clause naming a federal district court located in a state N where (1) neither of them was a citizen or resident and (2) where no business related to the contract was performed.\n\nThey had also consented to personal jurisdiction in state N, and agreed to apply State N\'s laws to any dispute.\n\nA lawsuit was filed in state N and it was promptly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nNeither the parties, the contract, nor the dispute had anything to do with N (and the Court had plenty of other work to do).\n\nAnd here\'s a recent example from a criminal case. In United States v. Levin, a warrant issued by a magistrate court judge was deemed void ab initio by the district court, rendering evidence seized with the warrant in admissible. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52907 (D. Ma 2016). The Court observed that ""the NIT Warrant made clear that the NIT would be used to \'obtain[] information\' from various ""activating computers.""\'\n\nAs is clear from Levin\'s case – his computer was located in Massachusetts – at least some of the activating computers were located outside of the Eastern District of Virginia. That the Website A server is located in the Eastern District of Virginia is, for purposes of Rule 41(b)(1), immaterial, since it is not the server itself from which the relevant information was sought.""\n\nI may have made you feel a little bit better, but please don\'t get too comfortable: I\'ve only noted two cases. And while subject matter jurisdiction isn\'t unlimited, Courts in the US exercise broad jurisdiction over many, many things, and through the Hague Convention and extradition treaties can reach outside of territorial boundaries to enforce US laws over matters they deem to be within their subject matter jurisdiction. To that end, someone running an illegal Ponzi scheme in Country Z that is directed to US citizens and causes harm in the US, may still be deemed subject to a US Court\'s subject matter jurisdiction. (This is not a normative evaluation or judgment, by the way, it\'s simply the lay of the land).\n\nTo illustrate this scope, here\'s how a ""I\'m outside of the US"" argument was recently rejected by a federal court in the Southern District of New York:\n\n""Budovsky\'s nexus argument is meritless. Assuming that the Government is required to state the nexus of the alleged crimes to the United States in an indictment, the Indictment includes several allegations that establish a sufficient nexus with the United States. The Indictment alleges, among other things, that Liberty Reserve had over 200,000 users in the United States; the site\'s users included criminal rings operating in the United States; Budovsky moved $13.5 million from a Costa Rican bank account held by Liberty Reserve through a correspondent bank account in the Southern District of New York; and Budovsky engaged in money laundering with the object of transferring funds in and out of the United States.\n\nBudovsky argues that his conduct and Liberty Reserve\'s operations occurred wholly outside the United States, that Liberty Reserve targeted a global market rather than the United States, and that the Indictment\'s claim that Liberty Reserve had 200,000 users in the United States could ""only be supposition."" Since in a motion to dismiss an indictment the facts alleged by the Government are taken as true, Budovsky\'s evidentiary arguments do not require dismissal.\n\nBudovsky further argues that even if the existence of a large user base in the United States constitutes a sufficient nexus, ""any operator of any web business -- located anywhere in the world -- could be hauled into United States courts."" While the advent of the web may create a theoretical concern about the extraterritorial reach of U.S. criminal laws, in this case the Indictment has sufficiently alleged the conduct of a criminal business with the aim of causing harm to US citizens and U.S. interests. See Al Kassar, 660 F.3d at 118; see also United States v. Rowe, 414 F.3d 271, 279 (2d Cir. 2005) (upholding venue in a child pornography case based on viewing of defendant\'s Internet advertisement in the forum state).""\n\nSee United States v. Budovsky, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127717 (D. S.D.N.Y. 2015).\n\nTakeaways: Subject matter jurisdiction isn\'t unlimited. At the same time, it\'s broader than many understand. How can you protect yourself against unwitting distributed liability? Understand your use case, identify jurisdictional nexuses, and don\'t assume that because you\'re in Country X that Country Y can\'t touch you. If particular jurisdictions are a concern, can you make a good faith effort to try to block them, understanding that there may be ways around any wall.\n\n(Also, I\'m not suggesting that anyone break laws or look for safe havens to do so, but extradition treaties and international judgment enforcement of course have some limitations. If Country X doesn\'t accept that conduct that Country Y deems a crime is in fact a crime, this may impact its court system\'s willingness to cooperate. Thus, an attempt to exercise jurisdiction extra-territorially can be dependent and limited by cooperation by other sovereigns).\n\n4. Personal jurisdiction\n\nIn addition to authority to decide a dispute between people, US courts need to have jurisdiction over the people themselves. By people, I include ""natural persons"" and corporate entities. This is known as personal jurisdiction or (if you like Latin) in personam jurisdiction.\n\nPhysical presence is the easiest way to get personal jurisdiction. If you are a citizen or resident of state A or happen to be in A state when a process server hands you a Summons and Complaint, your presence may be enough to give the Court in that state personal jurisdiction over you. Corporate entities may designate representatives who can be served for the entity, and rules or statutes may identify people who can be served on their behalf. Just because you own stock in a corporation, or are employed by it doesn\'t necessarily mean your presence in a particular state gives the state jurisdiction over the corporation.\n\nHow about personal jurisdiction over an unincorporated association? It\'s tricky, at best. For a flavor of this, if you\'re a hockey fan, take a look at Donatelli v. NHL,893 F.2d 459 (1st Cir. 1989), in which the Court held that ""an unincorporated association which does not itself conduct significant activities in, or enjoy affiliating circumstances with, a state cannot be subject to the general personal jurisdiction of the state\'s courts on the basis of a member\'s contacts within the state unless the member carries on the in-forum activities under the association\'s substantial influence. Because such control is absent here – there is no ""plus"" factor beyond the Bruins\' mere membership in the association – the district court\'s assertion of jurisdiction over the NHL was not constitutionally permissible. Reversed.""\n\nParties can also consent to personal jurisdiction (which you\'ll often see in a boilerplate contract). Parties may also waive objections to personal jurisdiction, as opposed to subject matter jurisdiction, which can\'t be waived. (See, e.g., Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2)).\n\nMost states (it may be all, but I haven\'t done a survey recently) have laws that govern a court\'s exercise of personal jurisdiction over non-resident defendants. These are called ""long arm statutes"". Entering into a contract in a state, contracting to insure a risk in a state, or committing a tort in a state are some common examples of things that will subject someone to personal jurisdiction in another state, under a long-arm statute.[4]\n\nF.R.C.P 4(e) tells US federal courts that they are to follow the law of the state in which the court is located, though this is subject to constitutional limitations.\n\nAsk a US lawyer about personal jurisdiction and even a transactional lawyer who hasn\'t thought about civil procedure for 25 years will probably mumble something about the International Shoe case and the requirement that someone ""purposefully avail"" themselves of the benefits of doing business in a particular jurisdiction.\n\nOver-generalizing, a bit: a random, incidental, episodic connection to a state may not be enough. Parties fight about this all the time, though, and it\'s up to a court to determine whether contact by someone from outside of the state would be sufficient to trigger long-arm jurisdiction. (The Supreme Court revisited personal jurisdiction in a 9-0 decision handed down in 2014 in Daimler AG v. Bauman et al.)\n\nThe takeaway: even if you are not physically present you can be subject to a court\'s personal jurisdiction. But you have to have some contact. How much? What kind? It depends. We\'ll talk about this a bit more in a second.\n\n5. In rem jurisdiction\n\nCan you sue a thing? Well, yeah, you kind of can.\n\nIf you can\'t locate or serve a person, a court may still be able to exercise ""in rem"" jurisdiction, or power/authority over a thing. When looking for an example, I came across a reference to a case that I wish we had studied in law school: United States v. One Tyrannosaurus Bataar Skeleton (SDNY 1:13?cv?00857).\n\nIn rem jurisdiction can be used to seize property, transfer ownership, and do so when the owner can\'t be haled into court for some reason but the property is physically within the Court\'s jurisdiction.[2] (See also, http://www.usmarshals.gov/assets/2015/dpr-february-auction/sale-order.pdf; http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/us-government-auction-10m-worth-bitcoins-silk-road-seizure-1522672).\n\n6. Concurrent jurisdiction and co-equal sovereigns\n\nI\'ve mostly referred to US Federal Courts. As a federal system, the US also has state courts, and states are treated as ""co-equal sovereigns"". There\'s a complicated collection of law that deals with this interaction. You can do something that is isn\'t a problem under federal law but is a problem under state law. You can also sometimes be liable under both.\n\nLot\'s of nuance here, but the nutshell is this: more than one court can have jurisdiction over the same thing (blue sky is one example).\n\n7. Conclusion: purposeful availment, presence, and paths forward\n\nI\'m going to conclude with a return to personal jurisdiction over foreign defedants for a second, as this is very much on point for distributed ledgers and DAOs.\n\nHow do concepts like presence or ""purposeful availment"" work for a distributed organization or project or platform that relies upon a distributed ledger? Are they relevant? What does presence mean? Physical? Virtual?\n\nThe good news (yes, there\'s good news) is that this isn\'t entirely uncharted territory. Everything old is new again. Back when the Internet was still a new(ish) thing to most people, courts had to grapple with defendants who were located outside of their states operating websites that could be viewed within their states. Courts applied existing legal principles to the technology, relying on International Shoe, Burger King v. Radiewicz and other precedent. They still do. (See and compare , Maritz, Inc. v. Cybergold, Inc., 947 F.Supp. 1328 (E.D. Mo. 1996) and ITI Holdings, Inc. v. Prof\'l Scuba Ass\'n, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3747; and see Sebastian Brown Prods., LLC v. Muzooka Inc., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40132 (D. Del. 2015)).\n\nWith or without legislative guidance, blockchain jurisdiction cases will do the same thing, whether a DAO is involved or not. It\'s how the Common Law works; life of the law = experience != logic, paraphrasing Holmes.\n\nStill, it\'s tempting to head down a rabbit hole here and attempt to provide a simple answer, or to go the opposite direction and not try at all and hope for the best. Neither is a good approach. It\'s more helpful to consider specific use cases and identify jurisdictions that might be implicated or interested.\n\nIt may also matter whether civil or criminal laws are at issue. If you\'re doing something clearly illegal in country X and are doing so in concert with people in Country X, or are directing communication to, with or into Country X, the fact that you are in country Y or the fact that it\'s blockchain don\'t seem like a terribly good jurisdictional defense to me. For a DAO, one might consider the forums where a dispute might arise and the form that the DAO takes. One might also consider whether an unincorporated association would be treated differently than a corporation, and if the latter is a structure for which presence and jurisdiction are easier to predict.\n\nI\'m not taking an absolute position on these things because I firmly believe that you need specific facts to determine outcomes. Anything else is advice or guidance in a vacuum.\n\nThat caveat in mind, I wouldn\'t agree that ""distributed presence"" always equals ""distributed liability"" any more than I would agree that it never equals ""distributed liability"". It depends on who you are, what you\'re distributing, what sort of presence you have, and where you have it.\n\nJustice Holmes would be right at home.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1]. These are my opinions only, are not legal advice, and are neither shared nor sanctioned by past, present or future clients or any firm with which I\'m associated. Also, while I\'m aware that several DAOs have been in the news lately, my observations are generic, and not directed at any particular organization. The ""How to Sue a DAO"" piece has been misunderstood by many. Anyone who thinks it\'s a roadmap for a lawsuit is encouraged to re-read the piece, footnotes 3 and 4 in particular. Nor does it say that all DAOs are general partnerships or associations. It points out some general legal principles that *might* apply.\n\n[2]. Barron\'s Law Dictionary (3d Ed., 1991).\n\n[3]. I\'m steering clear of distinctions between equity/law and other important but nuanced concepts like inherent authority because this isn\'t intended to be a hornbook review of jurisdiction, but some first principles, mostly for non-lawyers working on blockchain projects who may be asking basic questions.\n\n[4].

Blockchain, which is a giant, online public ledger, was developed to keep track of who owns bitcoins and who owned them in the past. But now the fund industry is examining how it could use the technology. Proponents say blockchain will revoluntise the finance industry. They believe it could eradicate the need for clearing and settlement, the long-standing process whereby ownership of a security is moved from one investor to another. This could mean fund managers and banks would need fewer staff for some roles, while investors would probably benefit from lower fees. Asset managers, including a cohort of UK managers, are also looking into employing the technology to trade directly with each other, cutting out traditional middlemen such as brokers and bringing their costs down in the process. According to a survey of 125 asset management professionals across fund houses, custodian banks and consultancies, blockchain is expected to be a very disruptive force within the fund industry. Asked which areas of financial technology will have the biggest impact on the fund industry, 42 per cent of those polled listed blockchain, while 43 per cent nominated big-data analytics, where large sets of information are analysed to uncover market trends or other useful information. In contrast, only a fifth listed robo-advisers, which provide automated online investment services. Keith Hale, executive vice-president for client and business development at Multifonds, the software provider that carried out the survey, says the possibility of blockchain disrupting so many different parts of the asset management industry has left many concerned. “There is quite a lot of the fear of the unknown with blockchain,” he says. Michelle Seitz, head of William Blair Investment Management, the $64.7bn US asset manager, says: “I do believe that [blockchain] has the power to disrupt the plumbing of the asset management industry, and if it does, it will speed the service and the delivery of what we do for the client, and cut out costs. “It could be a massive disrupter to the industry, but in a good way.” The fund industry is still trying to get to grips with the impact blockchain could have. Experts say it is difficult to understand the wider implications of the technology. Olivia Vinden, principal at Alpha FMC, the consultancy, says that as well as having the potential to eradicate the traditional settlement process, blockchain could also be used across other functions in the fund industry. This could include providing a new way for asset managers to interact with regulators or helping to prevent money laundering by making it easier for asset managers to keep track of their investors. “Blockchain could be totally transformative for the [fund] industry, both in how it operates and in terms of costs,” says Ms Vinden. Richard Hinton, a partner at KPMG, the professional services firm, says it is likely to take some time before blockchain’s impact is seen in the fund industry. “There is a still a lot of work to be done before it is adopted in a widespread fashion,” he adds.

Three authors of Cointelegraph have tried to do it in the US, UK and India, and here is what came out of it.\n\n“Ordering Pizza with Bitcoin in India is nigh impossible” - Shivdeep Dhaliwal, India\n\nI have never purchased anything with Bitcoin in India yet. Ever. No pizza chain in my city takes Bitcoin, so my idea was to buy a voucher with Bitcoin from either ZebPay or to credit a payments app called Mobikwik through Unocoin and buy pizza through that. Alas. This was not to be.\n\nThe Zebpay voucher had ran out of validity and Unocoin requires a long winded registration process that involves verifying your identification documents that couldn’t be possibly completed, as today is a Sunday.\n\nIf I have learnt anything it is this that Indian Bitcoin scene has yet to grow from its infancy. Not only does nearly no one accept Bitcoin directly at the counter, even Bitcoin exchanges are not providing transactional services on weekends.\n\nFurthermore even if I had purchased a voucher, it would not have worked today because Domino’s, the only Pizza company that accepts such a voucher is having technical difficulties on their website and would not let me log into my account. The Pizza with Bitcoin is thus Dead on Arrival.\n\nHowever I promised Pizza, and Pizza we shall have, though it would only have to be purchased with good old Rupees in a bank. So here it is a Hot Tandoori Chicken Pizza, fresh from India!\n\n“Remember, no pizza the day before pizza day!” - Andrew Quentson, UK\n\nWhen I was asked to buy a pizza with bitcoins, I thought it was going to take me hours of research figuring out how. To my surprise, it couldn’t be easier.\n\nYou can just go to Takeaway.com, order a pizza and just send them the bitcoins. Then enjoy your pizza on pizza day.\n\n“Paying with Bitcoin was as time-consuming as paying with a credit card” - Joël Valenzuela, US\n\nIn the United States, pizza is a staple of the American diet (especially for groups), and freely available in almost every town and city.\n\nThe standard pizza is pepperoni, though Americans are very fond of making almost any kind of food into a pizza. You can find sausage pizza, bacon pizza, mac and cheese pizza, teriyaki pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, even Mexican taco pizza.\n\nI bought a bacon cheeseburger pizza from Papa John’s in Durham, New Hampshire. Papa John’s is a popular national chain, and I used Bitcoin to buy a gift card through Gyft. The Gyft app has adjustable amounts for gift cards a Bitcoin payment option which integrates directly into the Bitcoin wallet.\n\nPaying with Bitcoin was roughly as time-consuming as paying with cash or a credit card.', 'I’ve been interested in bitcoin (BTC) as a concept since its inception. Until recently, however, I considered bitcoin more of a cryptographic experiment than something that could affect my daily life.\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles for me was practicality. A few years ago, buying bitcoin or selling them in order to get fiat (“real” currency such as American dollars or Euros) wasn’t easy at all. Now, however, bitcoin has become much more common as a currency and the technology required to use it has also become more user friendly.\n\nWith these improvements in mind, I have decided to try and use bitcoin as my only source of money. I don’t know about you, but honestly I’m sick and tired of the banking system. For one thing, I’m sick of being told to “trust” that my money is safe, even when I have no idea where it is or who is controlling it. With bitcoin, this is never an issue.\n\nAt the same time, I hate the idea that someone is monitoring how much I can withdraw or deposit at any given time. It’s my money and I should be able to access it whenever I want, without the interference or input of the government or banking officials. The same goes for mandatory waiting times on wire transfers—this isn’t a technical issue, banks are free to continue speculating on my money even when I am not able to access it. And, obviously, banking fees are a huge scam. They are simply way too high for the quality of service provided.\n\nPlease be aware that what follows is still a work in progress. I’m learning and experimenting as I go along. If you want to follow a similar path, make sure you know what you’re doing first—don’t just take my word for it.\n\nSecurity\n\nLike any other big life change, there are a few logistical issues we need to solve upfront. The first and most important one is safety. There are plenty of services that will allow you to create your own bitcoin wallet, but wallets stored on the web are as secure as the web infrastructure they rely upon.\n\nRemember, no matter how safe they claim to be, web services can be hacked (or simply go bankrupt). When this happens, you could lose all your money. Bitcoin has no central entity, meaning there’s no financial guarantee that you will get your bitcoin back if they somehow disappear.\n\nObviously, there is no way to perfectly protect your money, but buying a hardware wallet is a good place to start. Personally I’ve bought a Trezor, but there are plenty of other options available out there. A hardware wallet like the Trezor stores your cryptographic keys (the sequences you use to send or receive bitcoin). Bitcoin has no central entity, meaning there’s no financial guarantee that you will get your bitcoin back. Your computer sends each transaction to the device, and the device makes the transaction. There is no flow of information from the wallet to your computer, which makes it much harder for a malicious third party to compromise your bitcoin by hacking into your computer.\n\nMoreover, if you lose your device or break it, you can recover your bitcoin from the “initialization seed” given to you when you initialize the device for the first time.\n\nAs a general rule, you should only move the minimum amount of bitcoin you require out of your hardware wallet, and always remember to enable two-factor authentication. Having a very strong and unique password for every different web service is also good practice. You can use software such as KeepPass, 1Password or SafeInCloud in order to generate and store your passwords safely.\n\nGetting fiat (real money) from your Bitcoin wallet\n\nAfter getting the security question settled, there’s the issue of practicality. Bitcoin is great in theory, but can you pay for your groceries with it? Or your rent, for that matter, or your restaurant bill? Bitcoin is only as reliable as the means with it can be converted to US dollars or euros or whatever currency you need—anytime, anywhere.\n\nThe most obvious option is via debit cards. There are a few online services that allow you to open a bitcoin wallet (remember, do not deposit all of your bitcoin on these wallets) and receive a real debit card connected to it. This will allow you to access the funds in your wallet. The service I’m using right now is called CryptoPay, which I like the best so far. CryptoPay connects my Trezor hardware wallet with a physical debit card. Once you’ve verified your identity, the service places no limits on your activity, meaning you can charge the card as many times as you want with as much money as you need.\n\nPutting money into your bitcoin wallet\n\nBut how do you put money in your wallet in the first place? I work for a US company, and every month I receive my paycheck in USD (which eventually are converted to EUR from my bank). I needed a way to receive my money directly as bitcoin, preferably without asking my employer to switch to bitcoin payments. Ideally, I would just give him a new International Bank Account Number (IBAN), which would “map” to my bitcoin wallet.\n\nThere are two main services that allow you to do this, and I’m currently testing both. (I also asked for some users feedbacks on Reddit.) The services are Cashila.com and BitWage.com. My employer and I are keeping a close eye on bank transactions just to be sure payments go through smoothly. Similar in usability, they basically generate a unique set of bank coordinates along with a unique reference ID. You can then ask your employer to send your next paycheck to those coordinates—they will be automatically sent through the blockchain to your bitcoin wallet.\n\nCashila also allows you to make wire transfers, so if you want to pay your bills with a more traditional transfer, you can easily use your Cashila account. (Note: BitWage still does not offer this feature.) While some employers may not be initially familiar with this type of payment system, I have personally found that explaining the procedure (and why I’m doing it) can be quite persuasive. My employer and I are keeping a close eye on bank transactions going through the BitWage service just to be sure all payments go through smoothly. I think as more and more people are educated about the ways banks control our world, these types of work-around requests are going to become more and more common.\n\nConclusions\n\nUsing the aforementioned services and tools, I believe it is possible to live using bitcoin as your main form of currency. If I’m right, increasing numbers of people will never need to go to a bank again.\n\nOf course, there are other issues that need to be resolved as far as bitcoin the service is concerned, particularly its instability. While the value does change quickly, it seems to be stabilizing—in the last three months values oscillated between $373 and $479. This might seem like a lot, but services such as CryptoPay or CoinBase can watch the markets and convert your bitcoin quickly into a more traditional currency if values start to vacillate. Once the values stabilize, you’ll get your bitcoin back. In this way, you’re not going to lose much cash at all.\n\nI’ll check back in after a few months. In the meantime, if you still have doubts or questions, the BitCoin Reddit is a great source of information and user feedback.\n\nFollow Simone on Twitter at @evilsocket.

This coding breakthrough—which consists of concatenated blocks of transactions—allows competitors to share a digital ledger across a network of computers without need for a central authority. No single party has the power to tamper with the records: the math keeps everyone honest. Forty of the world’s top financial firms are experimenting with the tech.\n\nExample of blockchain in a sentence:\n\n“Bitcoin the currency, I think, is going to go nowhere … the blockchain is a technology which we’ve been studying and yes it’s real.” —Jamie Dimon on CNBC\n\nFor more on the blockchain, watch this Fortune video:\n\nA version of this article appears in the June 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline “Word Check: Blockchain.”', 'Although there has been some serious, public drama over scaling in the Bitcoin community for over a year, it appears that the community is mostly unified behind a single plan going forward, which is based on the "" Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus ."" There are still high-profile individuals, such as former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen and longtime Bitcoin angel investor Roger Ver , who would like to see an increase in the block size limit as soon as possible.\n\nSupport for Bitcoin Classic , which intends to deploy a block size limit increase to 2 megabytes via a hard fork , currently sits around 5 percent of the network hashrate , and representatives from the vast majority of Bitcoin miners and mining pools have no intention of breaking the previous agreement to run only Bitcoin Core software for the foreseeable future.\n\nBitcoin Magazine recently chatted with Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu about his current thoughts on Segregated Witness (SegWit), hard forks and the recent Beijing meeting between BIP 109 supporters and the Chinese Bitcoin mining industry. Bitmain runs one of the top two Bitcoin mining pools in the world, Antpool . The pool accounted for roughly 22 percent of all mined blocks over the four days prior to publication.\n\nComments on the Beijing Meeting\n\nBitcoin Magazine previously reported on a somewhat secretive meeting in Beijing that took place near the end of March. BTCC COO Samson Mow referred to the meeting as a ""train wreck,"" which is a description that some, such as Roger Ver, found to be inaccurate.\n\nWhen asked if he would refer to the meeting as a train wreck, Wu responded, ""It depends how you define \'train wreck.\' If it describes the status that no agreement [was] reached, it is a \'yes.\'""\n\nWu went on to clarify that an agreement, like the one made in Hong Kong, was not the purpose of the Beijing meeting (in his view). He explained:\n\n""We discussed lots of potential solutions around the scaling issues and debated possible problems with those ideas. As there is no intention to corner anyone into any promise, everyone feels free to discuss all possible ways of future actions. The meeting let everyone know about the position of each other very well.""\n\nWhen asked if he thinks the Bitcoin Core roadmap is sufficient, Wu responded, ""If (a soon and big enough) block size limit increase does [become] a part of the scaling roadmap, and the Lightning Network is ready soon enough, I think it will be sufficient for at least a few years from now.""\n\nAntpool Will Not Run Bitcoin Classic, May Delay SegWit\n\nDuring his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine , Wu confirmed that Antpool is testing Segregated Witness (SegWit) right now, and the mining pool will not be running Bitcoin Classic in a production environment for the foreseeable future. Wu added that Bitmain is honoring the Hong Kong agreement, ""even though lots of people think that SegWit is not \'released\' as there is only a pull request .""\n\nIt should be clarified that there was no explicit promise to release Segregated Witness by April in the Hong Kong agreement. Having said that, Wu put the agreement in the following context:\n\n""The context is that SegWit will be released in a very timely manner to address the block size scarcity problems in the near future. The China Bitcoin community side, including exchanges, wallets and miners, [are] concerned very much about the short-term problem. [The] SegWit release date was repetitively stated as in April. So delay of SegWit is a problem, though most of the parties will understand this problem and continue to act in good faith.""\n\nWu also shared his views on whether the current state of Segregated Witness can be viewed as a true release:\n\n""By \'release,\' it should be always a functioning, well-tested binary software that can let people to run safely in good faith. A code which is not merged, not tested, not agreed by their decision community is not a \'release.\' There are several \'release[s]\' in the agreement, and every \'release\' has the same implication or meaning.""\n\nBefore running Segregated Witness code in a production environment, Wu would like to see the hard fork code discussed in the Hong Kong agreement implemented in a release of Bitcoin Core. Wu explained:\n\n""We are waiting for the July hard fork code promised in the February Hong Kong meeting. We and other mining pools will want to talk to Core again after the hard fork code is public before we take next steps.""\n\nWhen asked specifically whether Antpool would run SegWit code without a hard fork increase in the block size also included in a release of Bitcoin Core, Wu responded:\n\n""No. It is acceptable that the hard fork code is not activated, but it needs to be included in a \'release\' of Bitcoin Core. I have made it clear about the definition of \'release,\' which is not \'public.\'""\n\nSome of the Bitcoin Core contributors who signed the Hong Kong agreement recently met in New York to discuss what should be in the proposed hard fork. The details of the proposed hard fork are expected to be known soon, and a thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list indicates a way to block the ASICBoost proposal has been discussed.\n\nIn the current environment, developers expect that an increase to the block size limit via a hard fork is unlikely to be merged into Bitcoin Core. Having said that, Bitcoin Core contributor and spokesperson Eric Lombrozo told Bitcoin Magazine that an increase via a soft fork is a possibility. Increases via a soft fork, such as extension blocks , have been discussed in the past.\n\nIt should be noted that Segregated Witness is also, effectively, an increase in the block size limit to roughly 1.7 megabytes. Schnorr signatures is another optimization that would allow more transactions to fit in each block.\n\nIn Lombrozo\'s view, hard forks should not be deployed under political pressure while animosity still exists between different segments of the community.\n\nIn the context of Antpool\'s current views on scaling, the lack of a hard fork deployment in Bitcoin Core could delay the activation of a Segregated Witness soft fork.\n\nWu: A Hard Fork is Still Needed\n\nWhile Bitmain is sticking with the Hong Kong agreement, Jihan Wu is worried whether Bitcoin Core will implement an increase to the block size limit. He noted the possibility of a "" disaster "" if the block size limit is not increased that would be caused by transaction delays and fee increases, but he understands that the Bitcoin Core contributors who attended the Hong Kong meeting cannot speak for those who were not there.\n\nWu noted that block space has a perfectly inelastic supply , which he noted is an economic term that is not often applied to the real world. He added, ""I really don\'t want the whole community to experience serious problems as a consequence of making [the] wrong choice.""\n\nWu did mention that Blockstream President Adam Back \'s recent presentation at Paralelni Polis was a positive sign. He stated:\n\n""The [recent] presentation by Adam Back for Slush showed that they have been taking the block size increase problem into serious consideration. It is a positive sign. We hope that the Core community members, especially those who have veto rights in their decision-making process, can realize the [importance of] increases [in] the main block size.""\n\nIn terms of when a block size limit increase is needed, Wu added:\n\n""We need to do it fast. The block size increase is, after all, a short term solution for emergency problems. Delaying to increase the block size will bring lots of problems, which mostly become the pain of Bitcoin enterprises such as exchanges and wallets.""\n\nTo illustrate his concern regarding the need for more block space, Wu shared a question asked by HaoBTC CEO Wu Gang during the Hong Kong meeting in February. Wu paraphrased:\n\n""Lots of on-chain transactions pop up now. The demand for Bitcoin transactions is higher and higher. What if SegWit and the Lighting Network cannot be ready and adaptive to the demand soon enough? Will we just ask the users to wait until we have finished the SegWit soft fork and Lightning Network?""\n\nWu added that Gang\'s question was not answered.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd to get an answer to Gang\'s question:', 'Bitcoin is a type of digital currency, most commonly defined as a virtual, digital or crypto- currency.\n\nBitcoin was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, who published the payment system in a whitepaper in 2008. Released as open-source software in 2009, the bitcoin system is peer-to-peer which means that transactions take place without the need for a third-party. These transactions or payments are then recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain, which uses bitcoin as its unit of account.\n\nThe blockchain is the backbone of bitcoin, serving as a financial ledger without any trusted central authority – this means that it is decentralized and no single person or institution owns the currency.\n\nWith every new transaction, recordings are added as ‘blocks’, which each block added in a linear, chronological order. Described in simple traditional banking terms – the blockchain is the full history of banking transactions, while the blocks are like individual bank statements. Bitcoins do not physically exist, instead there are only these records of transactions and balances.\n\nThe unit of currency in the bitcoin system is, simply, bitcoin. There are three symbols used to express bitcoin – BTC, XBT and ?. Bitcoins can be split down into alternative units such as millibitcoin (mBTC), microbitcoin (µBTC) and satoshi. Satoshi, named in honour of the bitcoin founder, is one hundred millionth of a bitcoin – the smallest amount possible.\n\nYou can acquire bitcoins as payment for a service or goods or through purchase at bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBitcoins, however, can be created by anyone – all you have to do is help process payments into the distributed ledger. By offering your own compute power to verify and record payments, bitcoins are created as a reward or payment for your services. This activity is widely known as bitcoin mining.\n\nWhy might bitcoin not be a success?', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Bitcoin Exchange Service Gatecoin Suffers a $2m Theft\n\n\n\nThis past week there was news about a security incident within crypto-currency exchange system affecting one service based in Hong Kong that was executing assets' sale associated with Ethereum-reliant DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations).\n\n\n\nOn Friday it was reported that Gatecoin encountered one cyber assault against its digital currency-filled hot wallets which led to huge funds loss. The exchange released one fresh update suggesting that a massive two million dollars were lost, substantiating the hack.\n\n\n\nCEO and Founder Menant of Gatecoin writes that during May 13 night HKT, the exchange spotted a few dubious transactions and instantly halted its services for conducting a probe as also for preventing any further illegitimate admission into the hot wallets of BTC and ETH.\n\n\n\nMenant continues that the service had earlier communicated about the storage of majority of customers' crypto-asset revenues inside multi-signature cold purses. Despite so the sinister outside party carrying out the current hack managed in changing Gatecoin's system in order that deposit transfers of BTC/ETH eluded the multi-signature cold wallets while landed straight into the hot purses over the hacking time, implying that ETH fund losses went beyond the 5% restriction which the exchange implemented upon its hot wallets.\n\n\n\nThe remaining crypto-currency remained from hackers' tampering because Gatecoin had kept them within multi-signature cold purses -far more difficult to meddle with. Another service trading Bitcoin namely ShapeShift encountered one likewise event in April 2016, when hackers seized currency from the trader's hot purses.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, according to the exchange, it was able in identifying as well as quarantining the addresses the thieves utilized for exfiltrating the asset revenues. Four Ethereum and six Bitcoin addresses were identified. Softpedia.com posted this, May 16, 2016.\n\n\n\nIn a voluntary effort, other companies for BTC trading helped Gatecoin via keeping vigil to find any transactions carried out of these wallets as well as track the digital money that got transferred from one end to another end of the block-chain.\n\n\n\nSignificantly, assuring its clients that their funds were secure, Gatecoin said it would recompense users who lost funds from their wallets. Moreover, Menant said the DAO and Digix tokens hadn't been tampered with.\n\n» SPAMfighter News - 24-05-2016"", 'BTC Media, the parent company of Bitcoin Magazine, and SixThirty recently announced a 24-hour blockchain hackathon with $25,000 in prize money will take place on June 12-13, 2016, a day before their Distributed: Trade conference, in St. Louis. Teams competing in the hackathon are tasked to build blockchain applications that optimize financial services and supply chain operations and to find solutions to problems in payments, supply chain management and data security.\n\nThe hackathon is being held at T-REX, a world-class facility in the heart of downtown St. Louis that incubates technology startups and provides resources to entrepreneurs as well as a vibrant community and working experience.\n\n“We are excited to host this Blockchain Hackathon in partnership with SixThirty, one of T-REX’s premier resident accelerators, who are a national and international leader in finding and funding cutting-edge financial technologies,” said Dr. Patricia Hagen, president of T-REX in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine. “A Blockchain Hackathon is a result of great partnerships and a demonstration of T-REX’s role as a hub of technology innovation in St. Louis.”\n\nRGAx, the innovation subsidiary of global reinsurance leader Reinsurance Group of America (RGA), has joined the event as title sponsor of the Distributed: Trade hackathon. The hackathon will award $25,000 in prizes for the best applications of blockchain technology.\n\n“I believe that the next generation of insurance products and services will be built using blockchain protocols,” said Tim Rozar, CEO of RGAx. “Blockchains enable all parties to improve trust and transparency, whether that is between consumers and their advisers or policy beneficiaries and insurance carriers. We’re supporting this hackathon to start the ball rolling and get new talented teams thinking about the future of the insurance industry.”\n\nOf the hackathon’s $25,000 in prize money, $20,000 will be awarded as a Grand Prize to the team that creates the best application related to the exploding opportunities for blockchain solutions in trade and finance. Additionally, Thomson Reuters is sponsoring a $2,500 prize, and $2,500 in prize money will be awarded to runners-up.\n\nThe panel of judges for the competition includes representatives of major players in the venture capital community actively looking to invest in new projects, as well as corporate executives and technology innovators. Represented on the panel are Blockchain Capital, Dynamo, Tally Capital and DFJ Dragon, along with technology executive Tom Niermann and Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik.\n\n“This competition pits teams from corporate giants, blockchain startups and the nation’s top universities against each other on a level playing field,” said BTC Media CEO David Bailey. On the academic side, teams will include students from MIT, Harvard, Cal Berkeley, Wellesley, NYU and Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n“The hackathon is an amazing chance for these brilliant students and other innovators to come together and make world-changing discoveries,” said Bailey. “People are coming here from all over the planet in search of the next big blockchain app.”', 'Both the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and NATO have put out requests for military-related apps built on blockchain technology, Quartz reports.\n\nDARPA wants to leverage blockchain technology to create a secure messaging service. The request for proposals, titled “Secure Messaging Platform” and listed under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program, targets a messaging platform able to transfer messages via a secure decentralized protocol that will be secured across multiple channels, including, but not limited to: transport protocol, encryption of messages via various application protocols and customized blockchain implementation of message deconstruction and reconstruction, and decentralized ledger implementation.\n\nDARPA notes that the planned Secure Messaging Platform will permit mapping the business logic of the DoD ecosystem onto a network of known entities using distributed ledgers. “By doing this significant portions of the DoD back office infrastructure can be decentralized, ‘smart documents and contracts’ can be instantly and securely sent and received thereby reducing exposure to hackers and reducing needless delays in DoD backoffice correspondence,” notes the request for proposal.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the DoD is to be achieved in three phases. It includes a secure messaging system based on decentralized ledger architecture and blockchain implementation, which can provide repudiation or deniability, perfect forward and backward secrecy, time to live/self-delete for messages, one-time eyes-only messages, a decentralized infrastructure to be resilient to cyber-attacks and ease of use for individuals in less than ideal situations.\n\nThe objective of the project’s Phase I is to create a specific decentralized messaging platform built on the framework of an existing blockchain. Phase II will develop, test and evaluate a working prototype with specific features, including a decentralized backend blockchain implementation. Finally, Phase III will will focus on full-scale implementation, industrialization and commercialization of the platform.\n\nSince the project’s Phase I is intended to leverage an existing blockchain implementation, it’s interesting to note that the project’s documentation makes explicit references to the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project, a collaborative effort started in December to develop an open, distributed ledger platform that will satisfy a variety of use cases across multiple industries. Supported by high-profile cross-industry players such as IBM, Intel, Accenture, as well as several banks and financial services firms, the Hyperledger Project has acquired a momentum that seems difficult to stop.\n\nHyperledger’s blockchain technology is independent of Bitcoin, and many companies in the group support radical alternatives to Bitcoin. For example, Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings, among others, expressed support for private, “permissioned” non-Bitcoin blockchains. It seems plausible that the permissioned approach is especially appealing for the defense establishment.\n\nDARPA is not explicitly mandating the use of Hyperledger, but reading the Questions and Answers part of the Secure Messaging Platform request for proposal gives the impression that DARPA is strongly encouraging the use of Hyperledger.\n\n“This is a fantastic move, and will pave the road for many entrepreneurs to roll up sleeves and start contributing to this sector” said Kevin Shahbazi, CEO of cloud-based security specialist LogMeOnce, as reported by Fox News. “DARPA’s task is significant, and it will help the market overall.”\n\nShahbazi added that blockchain technology is more trustworthy than legacy systems because messages and transactions are distributed and not kept in one central location, which makes hacking more difficult and at the same time easier to detect.\n\n“Blockchain protocols are a new class of protocols that are extremely resilient to attack ? they gain that resiliency by virtue of being decentralized,” added Emin Gun Sirer, associate professor of Computer Science at Cornell University. “It’s wonderful to see the government take an active interest in a very happening and very hot area of computer systems.”\n\nIn a related move, the NATO Communications and Information Agency is evaluating proposals submitted to the 2016 Innovation Challenge, aimed at accelerating transformational, state-of-the-art technology solutions in support of NATO C4ISR and cyber capability requirements. The request for outline proposals has a section titled “Military applications of Blockchains,” which includes application of blockchain technology to military logistics, application of blockchain technology to procurement and finance and a catch-all described as “other applications of interest to the military.” The NATO request for proposal also includes an Internet of Things (IoT) section, which seems appropriate for IoT-related applications of blockchain technology.\n\nThe growing interest of military agencies is one more signal that blockchain technology is becoming mature and ready for real-world application, and could bring more mainstream credibility and funding to distributed ledger development.']"
05/24/2016,"['Bitcoin has struggled to live up to the hype that surrounded its emergence into the mainstream three years ago. Despite more than a billion dollars of venture capital funding, Bitcoin startups have failed to develop applications that appeal to mainstream customers. And over the past year, the Bitcoin community has become paralyzed by a bitter feud over how — and whether — to expand the network\'s capacity.\n\nThe result: For the first time since its creation, Bitcoin is in danger of losing its status as the world\'s leading cryptocurrency. The new challenger is a Bitcoin-like technology called Ethereum that has seen a surge of interest from users, developers, and the corporate world. The network\'s currency, called ether, is now worth more than $1 billion — that compares to Bitcoin\'s total market value of nearly $7 billion. Last week, a leading Bitcoin startup called Coinbase announced it was adding support for Ethereum to its popular currency trading platform.\n\nThe growing excitement about Ethereum reflects the fact that it\'s a lot more than just a Bitcoin clone. People can use the Ethereum network to make payments, just as they can with Bitcoin. But the network can do a lot more than that.\n\nEthereum is a new kind of virtual computing platform. Its most exciting feature is its ability to create binding financial agreements that can be enforced entirely by software — no involvement by courts or other human mediators required. That, in turn, has made possible virtual organizations that exist only on the internet. One such organization, called the DAO, has raised more than $150 million in virtual currency to fund further work on Ethereum-based technologies.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum represents a technological breakthrough, allowing people to do things purely in software that weren\'t possible before. But the big question about Ethereum is whether it has practical applications. Ethereum has gotten techies excited, but so far no one has created an application for Ethereum — or Bitcoin, for that matter — that has appealed to mainstream consumers.\n\nEthereum is like Bitcoin, but for making commitments\n\nBitcoin is a global payment network like Visa or MasterCard, but with an essential difference: There\'s no company with ownership or control over the network. Instead, computers all over the world cooperate to maintain a shared record of transactions called a blockchain.\n\nThe key innovation that made this work was a clever scheme for rewarding computers that help build this shared ledger. Computers that participate are rewarded with freshly created bitcoins worth thousands of dollars every hour. As a result, there\'s no shortage of volunteers to contribute computing power to helping process Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe Bitcoin network is custom-designed to verify and record payments. In 2014, a 20-year-old programmer named Vitalik Buterin realized that he could create a Bitcoin-like network that could perform a much broader range of computational tasks. If Bitcoin is a distributed version of Visa or MasterCard, Ethereum is a bit like a distributed version of cloud computing platforms run by companies like Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nNot only can you use Ethereum to make ether-denominated electronic payments, you can also spend ether to run programs on the Ethereum network itself.\n\nEthereum is a very unusual cloud computing network. Every calculation is performed simultaneously by thousands of computers around the world, making it thousands of times less efficient than a conventional online server. And because the results of these calculations are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, all data is public. So Ethereum would be a terrible choice for conventional applications like running a web server.\n\nBut Ethereum\'s distributed structure also gives it a unique advantage: Once a program starts running, no one has the power to modify or stop it. That means you can use Ethereum to make binding, long-term commitments — which is why Ethereum programs are known as ""smart contracts.""\n\nThe early Ethereum applications may involve illegal activity\n\nA good way to illustrate Ethereum\'s capabilities is with an example. One of the biggest challenges of Bitcoin has been the currency\'s volatility; Ethereum offers a potential solution for this problem: a smart contract that hedges against currency fluctuations.\n\nTwo users might each submit $1,000 worth of ether to a smart contract. After a month, the smart contract would look up the current dollar/ether exchange rate, paying one user $1,000 worth of ether at the new exchange rate (which might be more or less ether than originally submitted) and sending the rest of the ether to the second user.\n\nThis works the same as a conventional hedging contract, with one important difference: The contract is enforced by a computer program running on the Ethereum network instead of by the courts. Once submitted, the program can\'t be modified by either party, so neither party has to trust the other.\n\nAs with Bitcoin, some of the early uses of Ethereum are likely to involve illegal activity\n\nOf course, the obvious question is why you\'d want to use such a convoluted technique to execute an ordinary financial contract. Modern financial markets make it cheap and easy to hedge against a wide variety of price fluctuations, and it\'s not obvious people are clamoring for a weird, internet-based alternative to these products.\n\nAs with Bitcoin, some of the early uses of Ethereum are likely to involve illegal activity. You can use ordinary financial networks to hedge against changes in the price of wheat or crude oil, but if you want to hedge against changes in the street price of cocaine, a smart contract might be your only option.\n\nEthereum could become a platform for online betting. Bitcoin already supports simple gaming applications, but more complex Bitcoin-based gaming requires players to trust the company running the game not to cheat. Smart contracts could allow the creation of complex, provably fair online games. Ethereum could also allow people to bet on events (like elections) in countries (like the United States) where such gambling is restricted by law.\n\nEthereum could also prove particularly useful in countries with dysfunctional legal systems. The ability to make binding legal commitments may not be so useful in countries like the United States where legal institutions work fairly well. But in countries where the courts are corrupt, incompetent, or nonexistent, the ability to make and enforce contracts online could be attractive.\n\nAs with Bitcoin, legally dubious applications come to mind quickly because Ethereum\'s decentralized structure makes it hard for governments to control. But the hope is that the same characteristics of decentralization and flexibility will allow people to build entirely new classes of applications that can\'t be built on top of conventional financial and legal infrastructure. So far, that hope has mostly not panned out for Bitcoin, but it still could happen — and people are just getting started exploring Ethereum\'s capabilities.\n\nEthereum allows a totally new type of organization\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to use Ethereum contracts, but the application that has attracted the most interest is virtual organizations. At a fundamental level, an organization is just a bundle of agreements between groups of people — shareholders, employees, creditors, and so forth. In most organizations, these are conventional contracts enforced by the court system. Ethereum allows the creation of decentralized autonomous organizations, whose contracts and bylaws are enforced by Ethereum smart contracts instead.\n\nThis is not just a theoretical possibility. A virtual organization called the DAO has raised more than $150 million over the past few weeks. Technically speaking, the DAO is just a specific Ethereum address controlled by a computer program running on the Ethereum blockchain. People send ether to this address and get back shares in the organization.\n\nOnce the fundraising phase is complete, these shareholders will be able to vote on what to do with the money. The idea is that the DAO will act as a kind of venture capital fund for the Ethereum community. Programmers and companies will submit detailed project proposals to the DAO. DAO shareholders will then vote on which proposals to fund.\n\nIt\'s important to take that $150 million figure with a grain of salt. For one thing, the DAO\'s funds are in the form of ether, and media hype about the DAO has pushed up ether\'s value, so once things settle down the DAO might not actually have $150 million at its disposal. Also, the DAO has a mechanism for shareholders to request refunds, so again, the full $150 million might not ultimately get spent.\n\nA virtual organization called the DAO has raised more than $150 million\n\nAnd the DAO — and DAOs in general — are going to face significant challenges.\n\nOne challenge relates to governance. The structure of conventional organizations developed over many decades, shaped by hard-won experience. They have boards of directors, CEOs, auditors, and well-defined management hierarchies to ensure that the organization behaves in a coordinated fashion and is accountable to shareholders.\n\nThe DAO is essentially starting with a clean slate, with most decisions made by majority rule. It\'s as if Apple asked its shareholders to vote on which products to develop. That could lead to erratic and unpredictable decisions, making third parties reluctant to enter into long-term relationships.\n\nAt the same time, the fact that the company\'s basic bylaws are hard-coded into the Ethereum blockchain means that a bug in the DAO\'s software could have disastrous consequences. If a design flaw causes the organization\'s operating software to behave in an unexpected and undesirable way, there might be no way to fix the problem other than to liquidate the organization and start over. There\'s no DAO board of directors with the power to make technical, commonsense changes to the bylaws the way they could in a conventional company.\n\nBlockchain-based organizations face challenges from regulators\n\nThe DAO may also encounter unwanted attention from securities regulators. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission has detailed regulations that companies must follow when they offer investments to the general public, and most other countries have similar rules.\n\nThe DAO\'s creators don\'t appear to have followed any of these regulations. And indeed, it\'s not clear that it\'s even possible for a purely blockchain-based organization to comply with SEC rules, whose authors probably never considered the possibility that a company could be an autonomous computer program running on a blockchain.\n\nIn some ways, DAOs are in a similar position with respect to SEC regulations that Bitcoin was in with respect to regulations governing money-transmitting services. Bitcoin seemed to meet the commonsense definition of a money-transmitting service, and arguably should have complied with consumer protection and money laundering laws.\n\nBut Bitcoin\'s decentralized structure meant that there was no specific person whom regulatory authorities could fine or prosecute for flouting the law. And so regulators contented themselves with regulating Bitcoin exchanges — companies that convert bitcoins to dollars, and vice versa — and allowed Bitcoin itself to operate free of regulation.\n\nThe big question is whether the SEC (and regulators elsewhere in the world) will take the same laissez-faire attitude toward the DAO. They might decide that it\'s too difficult to try to force DAOs to comply with securities law, or they might choose to interpret securities laws in ways that exclude virtual, blockchain-based organizations.\n\nBut securities regulators might also take a more aggressive posture. No one directly controls the DAO, but 10 prominent members of the Ethereum community — including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin — serve an oversight role as ""curators"" for the DAO. They could conceivably face unwelcome attention from investment regulators.\n\nIt\'s possible that the DAO and other virtual organizations will find ways to navigate these tricky legal waters. For example, a conventional organization called DAO.LINK was recently created to provide conventional services — like invoicing and tax compliance — to blockchain-based organizations. Conceivably, organizations like this could provide legal services to DAOs and help them navigate the tricky regulatory issues they raise.', 'How do consortiums/private Blockchains affect Bitcoin? Financial institutions are trying different ways of approaching Bitcoin’s blockchain. These technologies could be applied to our financial system by 2020.\n\nWe are witnessing the development of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies known as alternatives. The path has certain obstacles, and the banking system tries to eliminate any possible dangers.\n\nWhy Bitcoin cannot be used by financial institutions\n\nIn 2015 we have seen a many articles regarding the issue of public vs. private blockchain.\n\nThe main argument as to why Bitcoin could not be used by financial institutions is down to the number transactions which could be done per second. Bitcoin’s blockchain network is only capable of processing about six or seven transactions a second. In contrast, Visa has the capacity to process 65,000 per second.\n\nThunder, Chain and R3CEV are about to change the game\n\nBlockchain released another code on 16 May 2016 called Thunder which has the potential to facilitate secure, trustless, and instant payments, at a scale of 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nBitcoin startup company Chain on 02 May 2016 announced the Chain Open Standard 1 (Chain OS 1), which is an open source blockchain protocol. This will be controlled by financial corporations.\n\nPreviously efforts have been made by the R3CEV, which includes 43 global banks. They have released a distributed ledger system for financial services called Corda, aiming to have strong digital identity, as they will pass AML/KYC.\n\nBlockchain to enhance data systems\n\nMany companies are trying to win this race, and always we have to remember the reason why Bitcoin’s blockchain is important. It is created by mining procedure, not only by the transactions alone.\n\nAnother company offers a different path. ChainReactor is a new startup company created by a former banking member Jon Nelson. He is focused on using Blockchain technology to enhance data systems.\n\nJon Nelson explains his idea:\n\n“ChainReactor provides node support to all major database platforms, leading blockchain technologies, a decentralized exchange of assets and supports HFT with less than a second block times. ChainReactor can perform a billion transactions per second and can scale higher.”\n\nIt will be a permissioned distributed ledger for enterprises only, with a strong digital identity, as they will pass AML/KYC. Miners and users have to comply or otherwise the system won’t let them inside.\n\nHow to avoid problems related to national laws\n\nAccording to Nelson, a database shard is a horizontal partition of data in a database or search engine. Each individual partition is referred to as a shard or database shard. Each shard is held on a separate database server instance and to spread the load each of the shards becomes a mini blockchain allowing it to use the computing power more efficiently.\n\nA transaction in the case of cryptographic assets will involve two shards or more and a series of decentralized main reactors provides the core services, as name resolution, exchange, trust and configuration management.\n\nThe ability to use the Blockchain for what it is - a log of chained transactions in blocks - gives the ability to apply the methods and not keep the data after a certain period if the application requirements are not needed.\n\nNelson says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Here is the biggest problem with Bitcoin - the transaction log never concludes the data and you have to read the whole damn thing to understand the state of the data, which is not necessary if the data has been concluded and you have a period of the log to back it up. Keep in mind you have to have block depth to know where the node has concluded to if the block is not confirmed, so the conclusion is rolled back to the previous block and the processing is mostly serial in nature.”\n\nThese procedures eliminate any obstacles regarding the existing laws in every country.\n\nWhat about permissioned Blockchain and its future?\n\nWe talked to experts and asked them how they see the future of Blockchain as part of a global financial system.\n\nNina Kilbride, lawyer and software developer working on smart contract systems at Eris Industries, says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“The permissioned blockchain value proposition goes beyond the act of settlement. It is the addition of data certainty. The sequelae of data certainty are far, far deeper than tech application, especially in legal contexts.”\n\nHans Lombardo, co-founder at Chain of things, finds ChainReactor interesting. “The problems with traditional permissioned network are there by design. For example, the comparatively lengthy settlement times are there on purpose.”\n\nKonstantinos Karasavvas, computer scientist and expert in Systems Engineering & Architecture, Distributed Systems and SOAs, believes that, “Blockchain will find its place in the tech stack of certain companies but without major adoption of cryptos.”', 'Bitcoin remains the clear market leader in the world of cryptocurrency, although several competitors have come to fruition in the past few years\n\nWhen looking at the cryptocurrency market as a whole, this movement is becoming quite popular and keeps increasing in value. Not all of that value – US$19.481 bn – stems forth from the Bitcoin price itself, but also the companies active in this space.\n\nBitcoin Ecosystem Value Gets Close to US$20bn\n\nFor an initiative only a few dedicated people thought would be successful, the Bitcoin protocol has seen spectacular growth over the past seven years. Part of this success can be attributed to Bitcoin being labeled as having “enormous potential to disrupt the Fintech space and revolutionize currency and payment systems”. But don’t forget about all of the companies active in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\nA new report, titled “Global Cryptocurrency Market Insights And Analysis: Technology, Sizing, Growth, and Potential”, was released earlier today. This 75-page report looks at the growth all of the popular cryptocurrencies have gone through, as well as how the blockchain technology has evolved. Although speculation has been a driving factor for several years, the increased acceptance of Bitcoin payments by industry-leading organizations has legitimized the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin remains the clear market leader in the world of cryptocurrency, although several competitors have come to fruition in the past few years. That being said, the market value of the Bitcoin ecosystem itself is estimated at US$19.481 bn, which is quite a significant amount compared to the value most people see when looking at the Bitcoin currency market cap.\n\nCompanies active in the Bitcoin world are driving the total value up, though. Enterprises such as Bitstamp, Bitfinex, and Poloniex are all attracting a lot of traders, as well as investors.The report also indicates future growth is expected in both value and volume, and cryptocurrency will become more common among mainstream consumers in the next few years.\n\nAnother factor a lot of people tend to overlook is the Bitcoin ATM market, which seems to be exploding over the past twelve months. The Global ATM Market Report indicates this growth will continue at a rate of 5.49% per year until 2021. Most of this growth is expected to come from the banking industry, although it remains to be seen how this would be realized.\n\nAll in all, things are looking quite positive for Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies. There is continual growth in the number of users and volume of currency changing hands every year. More merchants start to accept cryptocurrency payments, albeit this market segment is dominated by Bitcoin. Exciting times are ahead if this report is to be believed.\n\nSource: PR Newswire\n\nHeader image courtesy of NewsBTC', 'One of the most fascinating aspects of the Bitcoin narrative is the trajectory of its price.\n\nSince its birth seven years ago, this abstract currency that only exists as computer code and/or in a small but rabid collective conscious has gone from completely worthless to almost $450 for a single Bitcoin.\n\nSoon, it will reach a milestone that could boost the price even further — what is known in the Bitcoin community as a halving event.\n\nThe mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, set a unique monetary policy at the start: That there would only ever be 21 million bitcoins, that they would be released roughly every ten minutes, and that the rate at which they would be generated would drop by half every four years until all were in circulation.\n\nSo far, there’s only been one halving event, which occurred on November 28, 2012, which reduced the amount of new bitcoins being created every ten minutes from 50 to 25. Then, the price was $12 and change, the market capitalization was not much more than $100 million, and a lot less computing power had been invested into the network underlying the currency. (In case you’re wondering what happened, 10 days later, the value was about 10% higher.)\n\nAt the next halving event, most likely to occur in mid-July, a lot more is at stake: $1.15 billion venture capital has been invested into the digital currency space, with $649 million of it in Bitcoin companies specifically (as opposed to blockchain). The market cap of Bitcoin is $7 billion. And investors are putting Bitcoin-related investment vehicles into their retirement accounts. Plus, the network has to process a few hundred thousand transactions per day.\n\nSo what will happen when the number of new bitcoins minted a day drops from 3,600 to 1,800? (Or from $1.6 million to $800,000 at current exchange rates?)\n\nThe efficient market hypothesis posits that the halving is already baked into the current price. But “it’s a stretch to say that Bitcoin is an efficient market at the moment. It’s so thin in terms of its liquidity,” says Chris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at ARK Investment Management, the first public fund manager to invest in Bitcoin.\n\n“There’s always a lot of factors in the price of Bitcoin, but all those things being equal, [the halving] should help the price go up, if for no other reason than of the rule of economics,” says Gil Luria, a Wedbush Securities analyst who covers the Bitcoin investment vehicle GBTC. “It’s a function of the intersection of supply and demand, and the halving literally means there will less [new] supply every day.”\n\nBut because new developments are constantly occurring in Bitcoin, all other factors will surely not remain equal. Here we dive into a few other influences on Bitcoin to see how they will interact with the halving to affect the price.\n\nConcern #1: Will miners, who maintain network security, be able to weather a potential drop in their profitability?\n\nOne of the unique aspects of Bitcoin is that, in order to keep the network running, a group within the ecosystem known as miners needs to be incentivized to keep processing the transactions. Currently, their reward is the new bitcoins being created every ten minutes. (As fewer and fewer bitcoins are released, that will likely switch more to transaction fees which are now a nominal part of mining revenues.)\n\nWith the number of new bitcoins dropping in half, unless the price immediately doubles, miners could see their revenues cut steeply. And the worry is that if enough miners don’t continue to find the activity profitable, then the network will be maintained only by a few, which would centralize control and put the network at risk of an attack. (One of the reasons the Bitcoin blockchain is considered so secure is that it lacks a single point of vulnerability.)\n\nBut Valery Vavilov, the chief executive of mining, chip manufacturing and blockchain services company Bitfury, which experienced the first halving, says, “The profit margins will be less temporarily but we are ready for this.”\n\nAnd Bitfury may not be the only mining company able to accept lower profits for a period. According to statistics by blogger Organ Ofcorti, from May 15 to 21, most mining pools earned more bitcoin than would be expected — 105% to 122% — given the “hash rate,” which is the amount of processing power on the network. (However, it should be noted the “pool profitability” figures don’t specifically refer to revenues minus costs, just to actual income vs. expected income.)\n\nOne concern is that miner income has gone down dramatically from more than 70 bitcoins a week a year ago to less than 20 a week now, but given the climb in Bitcoin\'s value, the decrease in U.S. dollar value is about half.\n\nBut overall, the fact that the amount of computing power put into the network has gone up recently -- after stagnating from February to April, the network’s hash power began rising again -- could indicate not only that mining is still profitable but that miners are optimistic.\n\nNoting that mining hardware has become less expensive in the last three months, Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTCC, which runs a Bitcoin mining pool and exchange, says, “For the miners, it’s very straightforward — it’s all about the return on investment — how much capital they put in now and how much they’re anticipating over the lifetime of the equipment. If that’s a positive number, accounting for price fluctuations and risk and difficulties, then they buy the equipment. So even though the halving is coming up, they’re modeling how much they’ll make over the life of the machine.”\n\nLee also adds that miners can also hedge the price of bitcoin to protect against future losses in income. “They know how many bitcoins they’re going to make over the next six months, so they pre-sell the bitcoins at today’s price so they don’t have to worry,” says Lee. Companies like his have future exchanges where the miners can pre-sell bitcoins at today’s prices to protect themselves against future price drops.\n\nAdditionally, advances in chip technology should also help them maintain profitability, as seen below.\n\nMust Read: 8 Market Myths To Avoid\n\nConcern #2: Will the security of the network be compromised?\n\nDespite the indication that miners seem to be investing in the network, Lee says that some miners will definitely drop out, or at least take older machines down, and so the computing power on the network may fall.\n\n“The hash rate will come down a little bit but it doesn’t matter for security,” he predicts. “It might lose at most 25-30% of the hash rate at the maximum and then it will pick itself back up.”\n\nIn mid-2015, the Bitcoin network’s computing power was 6,000 times that of the world’s top 500 supercomputers combined. The current figure is even greater now, which is why many believe a dip in the security of the network won’t leave it susceptible to attack -- it can likely afford the drop.\n\nIn fact, the security will rise simply due to advances in the technology alone. “This halving is a good thing for the industry, because it gives motivation to companies such as ours to create more efficient infrastructure,” says Vavilov.\n\nMore efficient chips are more secure. Vavilov recalls how, when Bitcoin mining began, many people were doing it using the CPUs on their computers. Chips eventually got more advanced and specialized for Bitcoin mining. “If we now processed Bitcoin transactions using CPUs, the network security would be much less secure,” he says.\n\nThey also help security in another way: The main determinant of miners’ profits is their energy costs. “The chips drive the cost because their power consumption is the main parameter in this equation,” Vavilov says. In order to reduce energy costs, miners seek more efficient chips. For instance, the Bitfury website says of its new 16nm chips, “When we started the design of our 16nm ASIC we set a design goal of 0.06J/GH efficiency that would enable us to continue operating profitably even when the block reward is reduced by half.” And more efficient chips allow the network to process more transactions at lower cost, which should help keep miners online, thereby helping boost network security.\n\nBurniske concurs. “If mining machines are getting more and more efficient, then you should be able to connect more hashing power for less dollar amount. It’s basically what we’ve seen with every single computer chip out there,” he says.\n\nAs he writes in his white paper, Securing the Bitcoin Network, ""The average [earnings before interest and taxes] margin for the electric utilities industry over the trailing twelve months ended Q2 2015 was 14.94%, a third that of the big bitcoin miners. With time, as miners earn less income from block rewards, but also spend less on fixed costs and refreshing their installed based (due to the maturation of specialized ASIC9 hardware), ARK Invest believes that bitcoin mining margins will converge with that of the electric utility industry.""\n\nBottom line: improvements in technology will enable miners to obtain computing power at lower price, which should help them endure periods of reduced profitability after the halving. Plus, even if some drop out, the chips themselves are more secure, which helps offset losses in security.\n\nConcern #3: Will rising transaction volume hit the limit, causing usability issues and loss of confidence?\n\nFor much of the last year, one question has been hanging over the price of Bitcoin. An ongoing debate over how to accommodate increased transaction volume on the network (which some feel is uncomfortably close to the limit on the amount that can be processed at any given time) has been raging, with the community splitting into factions, including different Reddit forums and developer teams.\n\nThe proposal with the most support from developers and miners (called Segregated Witness or SegWit) was not a change that could be quickly implemented, however, and so now, it is uncertain whether it will be rolled out before the halving or not.\n\nOne doomsday scenario is that the upgrade (SegWit) is not enacted in time and the halving sparks increased trading, causing transaction volume to bump up against the limit, which in turn delays transactions and saps confidence in the currency. That, in turn, hurts the miners’ profitability even more than expected, causing more to drop out, resulting in an even less secure network, which would then cause an even greater loss of confidence in Bitcoin’s value, leading to a downward spiral.\n\nBut core developer Eric Lombrozo says that the upgrade will roll out soon, though the team cannot guarantee that it will be fully adopted by all miners by the time of the halving. “Even if it’s not deployed before that, it probably won’t affect the network much,” he says.\n\nSegWit will allow at least 1.6 times as many transactions through, though Lombrozo says it could be closer to 1.8 or 2, especially since it’s becoming more common for transactions to have the security feature called multisig, in which more than one person signs off on the transaction.\n\nAnd to go back to the doomsday scenario, even if the halving sparks increased trading volume — especially now that the Bitcoin ecosystem has a burgeoning group of professional traders — much of that is likely to occur on exchanges rather than directly on the Bitcoin network, where one transaction takes, on average, 10 minutes to confirm.\n\nIn fact, keeping a low limit on the number of transactions that can be processed at any given time could help boost the price. If the minting of new Bitcoin is cut in half and transaction volume continues to rise, then there are two ways to accommodate that demand: One would be for “velocity,” or the number of times money has to turn over in order to fulfill a certain level of GDP, to skyrocket. The other would be for the price to go up. But, Burniske says, “we’re maxing out in terms of the number of transactions that each block can hold over a 10-minute period. If that doesn\'t abate, the other way to help accommodate the demand is the price level going up.”\n\nFinal question: How much should we expect the price to rise?\n\nOverall, it seems likely that the halving will eventually boost the price. While it’s impossible to predict what the value will be, it is worth noting that two analysts have named targets in the $600-$655 range.\n\nLast fall, Luria of Wedbush put a $60 price target on the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), based on a value of $600 per BTC. (It currently trades at $66 while Bitcoin is hovering at over $440 because of greater demand than availability for what is a publicly traded security.) And recently, a report by Needham & Company estimated a present value of $655 per Bitcoin, at $62 per share of GBTC.\n\nWhile their assessments are based on factors such as increased developer activity and transaction volume, history shows that influences on Bitcoin’s price will be as unpredictable as Grexit, Chinese capital controls, developer infighting, Ponzi schemes and whatever else fate has in store for this grand experiment with money.', ""For cryptocurrency enthusiasts seeking mainstream adoption, events like this are so unhelpful.\n\nHackers appear to have made off with the equivalent of $2 million in digital currencies from Gatecoin, according to a notice posted on the exchange’s website. The Hong Kong-based firm admitted a security breach occurred between May 9 and 12 that allowed unauthorized access to its “hot wallets” holding both Bitcoins and Ethere (a Bitcoin rival). In total, the hackers were able to steal 250 Bitcoins and 185,000 Ethers, representing 15% of Gatecoin’s crypto-asset deposits.\n\nCryptocurrencies are said to be more vulnerable when held in a hot wallet because they’re accessible on the web from any connected device. When they’re in “cold storage,” on the other hand, the private keys needed to transfer their value are held in a secure, offline device.\n\nThe details of how the hackers were able to pull off such a heist still have yet to be disclosed. Tehtri Security, a French cybersecurity firm, is said to be conducting a forensic investigation of the breach.\n\nIn a Reddit post from Friday, Gatecoin's CEO Aurélien Menant said the investigation was taking longer than expected as they continue to focus on improving security for its other crypto-assets.\n\nThe post also stated that Gatecoin was trying to raise investment in order to reimburse all clients’ Bitcoin and Ether funds. The company’s target is to raise between $4 and $5 million to cover for the losses and to strengthen Gatecoin's tech team with the aim of relaunching the exchange with a new security infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, Menant has offered a bounty of 25% and lifetime free trading on the exchange for the return of any Ethers and Bitcoins that were stolen.\n\nGatecoin is an exchange and trading platform for a range of digital currencies. It was cofounded in July 2013 by Menant, a former investment banker with Societe Generale, J.P. Morgan and BNP Paribas . Menant is also a founding member of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, which seeks to foster and promote Bitcoin and its technology.\n\n“Criminals understand cryptocurrency better than almost anyone, which probably helps explain some of their success in this area,” Bryce Boland, Chief Technology for Asia Pacific at FireEye, said in an e-mail. “Unfortunately we're going to see many more of these incidents before things get better.”\n\nIn recent years, thieves have successfully targeted a number of exchanges which are seen as attractive targets due to the large sums of currencies they routinely handle.\n\nIn April, cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift admitted that it had become the victim of an inside job after reportedly losing some $230,000. First, an employee helped himself to 315 Bitcoins ($130,000) and then, after being fired, he sold information to a hacker who promptly stole another $100,000 in Bitcoins, Ethers and Litecoins.\n\nChina-based exchange BTER said that 7,170 Bitcoins ($1.75 million) were stolen in February last year in an apparent hack on its cold wallet system. The company didn’t reveal much about the theft except that it had occurred through a single transaction. At the time, BTER claimed to be the world's largest trading platform for altcoins (Bitcoin rivals), with 230,000 registered accounts, including 130,000 Chinese users.\n\nEuropean exchange Bitstamp admitted to losing almost 19,000 Bitcoins ($5 million) a month earlier. The exchange which described itself to Forbes as “the backbone of the Bitcoin economy,” reportedly fell victim to its own employees unknowingly downloading malware through e-mail.\n\nBut it's also worth noting that hackers aren’t just targeting cryptocurrencies. At least three banks have admitted to being attacked through the global messaging network Swift (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication). As authorities continue in their efforts to recover the $81 million stolen by hackers from Bangladesh’s central bank in February, a bank in Ecuador recently admitted to having lost about $12 million in a similar fashion and a Vietnamese commercial bank narrowly avoided falling prey to some fraudulent requests late last year.\n\n“Financial institutions are under siege by advanced cyber attackers, and even well-resourced established organizations can be compromised,” Boland added."", 'Kanishka Sukumar, a 24-year-old consultant in midtown Manhattan, holds about a third of his wealth in bitcoin. He represents a new generation of “gold bugs” who question the stability of paper currency or seek better ways to protect savings, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nOne in five bitcoin users hold the cryptocurrency since they don’t want the government or banks controlling their money, according to a survey of 3,500 bitcoin users. That was the second biggest reason the survey respondents hold bitcoin. The main reason, according to the survey from data provider CoinDesk, was to own bitcoin as an investment.\n\nSince bitcoin’s price volatility has eased, it has become a more viable store of wealth.\n\nHedge Fund Manager Likes Bitcoin\n\nMichael Novogartz, a hedge fund manager who owns bitcoin and left Fortress Investment Group LP last fall, calls bitcoin an “I don’t trust people” purchase. He owns only one ounce of gold, which was a gift, compared to a “significant” amount of bitcoin. He said bitcoin will attract people who otherwise would buy gold.\n\nBitcoin’s price volatility fell below gold’s for 28 straight days in April, the longest period ever. The volatility for bitcoin also fell below the Japanese yen, another flight-to-trade currency, according to FactSet and CoinDesk data.\n\nBitcoin’s popularity is also due to its quick, anonymous transactions. The number of bitcoin wallets doubled to more than 12 million in 2015, according to CoinDesk.\n\nVolatility Benefits Some\n\nBitcoin has also drawn traders seeking to profit from its volatility. CME Group, a derivatives marketplace, noted this month it is developing a bitcoin spot price index. The New York Stock Exchange tracks the price.\n\nOne user, 25-year-old Murat Akdeniz, a Cornell University business student, has been doing less bitcoin trading, on account of its volatility. He said it makes more sense to buy and hold the currency.\n\nBitcoin’s popularity is also due to the younger generation’s trust in technology over governments, Akdeniz said. Should China sell its gold reserves, the bitcoin price won’t be negatively impacted, he added.\n\nEconomic uncertainty is another reason people hold bitcoin, particularly with recession fears roiling markets and central banks cutting interest rates.\n\nUncertainty Concerns Investors\n\nGil Luria, head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said bitcoin has become a store of value for individuals concerned about other classes of trade. He said gold was once the only refuge for persons with grave concerns about the monetary system and the global economy.\n\nDuring last year’s Greek crisis, investors seeking safety flooded into both bitcoin and gold, according to bitcoin exchanges and traders.\n\nBrian Estes, a venture capitalist in St. Louis, said bitcoin is a hedge against an economic collapse. He compared holding bitcoin to having a hedge against banking systems and the ATMs not being functional.\n\nThere are skeptics about bitcoin’s future. It faces regulatory hurdles worldwide.

A sharp move lower could find support at the triangle bottom around $450 or until the dynamic support at the 100 SMA.\n\nStochastic is on the move up to indicate that bulls are in control of bitcoin price action, likely with enough energy to take it back up to $470 or perhaps even higher. If so, a longer-term uptrend could ensue, bringing bitcoin price to the previous year highs closer to $500.\n\nA bit of a bullish divergence can be seen as stochastic made lower lows while price made higher lows, adding confirmation that buyers are ready to get back in the game. Meanwhile, RSI is treading sideways on middle ground so the consolidation could carry on.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe lack of top-tier releases from the US economy has allowed risk sentiment to dictate bitcoin price action for the past few days. So far, risk appetite has been present thanks to the continued rally in crude oil prices.\n\nHowever a return to dollar demand could be seen once the US economy starts printing upbeat data. Recall that Fed officials have specified that the June decision will be data-dependent and that a rate hike could still be a possibility, even though there might be risks stemming from a potential Brexit and weaker inflation expectations.\n\nIf signs point to the Fed sitting on its hands for June and waiting for the July meeting instead, the US dollar could continue to lose ground to bitcoin and open the possibility of an upside breakout from the longer-term triangle pattern.

05/25/2016,"['For the last four years, a heavily funded startup called Coinbase has been all about the digital currency bitcoin. And its Twitter bio said it all: ""The easiest way to buy bitcoin.""\n\nBut earlier this week, that tagline changed. ""Our mission is to create an open financial system for the world,"" it now reads.\n\nThat swap of a few words is significant. It underscores the crisis recently facing the bitcoin movement and the rapid rise of a potential competitor network called Ethereum.\n\nCoinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam laid out this inflection point in a long blog post yesterday. He talked up why he was excited about Ethereum, which is less than a year old, and why Coinbase is now supporting it.\n\n""While Ethereum is less battle tested,"" he wrote, ""it is moving faster, has better leadership and has more developer mindshare. First mover advantage is challenging to overcome, but at current pace, it’s conceivable.""\n\nA spokesman confirmed to Recode the reason for the change. ""Coinbase is supporting Ethereum, so moving from ‘bitcoin company’ to digital asset company.""', 'The upper house of Japan\'s national legislature approved a bill on Wednesday to regulate domestic digital currency exchanges, a move that comes nearly two years after discussions about how to regulate the technology first began.\n\nAccording to a report by The Japan Times, the decision will now require digital currency exchange operators to register with the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the government agency that oversees finance activities in the country. The action also comes with a grace period for businesses affected, as it will not come into force until one year from its approval.\n\nReports indicated that the measure was passed as part of a larger update to national banking law that sought to boost the domestic FinTech industry. The measures for digital currencies, by contrast, were fueled out of a desire for consumer protection and to prevent payment applications of the technology from assisting in terrorist financing.\n\nIn statements, the Japan Blockchain Association (JBA), a regional advocacy group, praised the decision. Yuzo Kano, the organization\'s chief administrative officer, told CoinDesk:\n\n""The JBA welcomes this new law and would like the thank the efforts of the lawmakers, FSA and related government agencies, and all other involved parties who helped see this bill through.""\n\nIncluded in the law are provisions mandating that such firms separate the oversight and management of fiat and virtual currency funds, as well as enforce anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) rules.\n\nDeliberations on the measure began in earnest late last year, when the FSA began openly discussing how it might seek to classify bitcoin under domestic law. The agency eventually settled on the idea that bitcoin represented an “asset-like” or “property” value that echoes its classification by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the US.\n\nThe FSA began formulating its plans to regulate bitcoin exchanges in the wake of the collapse of Tokyo-based Mt Gox, the now-defunct exchange service that collapsed just over two years ago.\n\nThe decision comes as interest in startups leveraging bitcoin and blockchain technology is growing domestically. In the past month, two local startups received significant venture funding rounds, bitFlyer and TechBureau raising $27m and $6.5m, respectively.\n\nThe FSA itself has also become more vocal about the potential benefits of blockchain technologies this year, advocating in statements that the country needs to become a regional leader in its development.\n\nDiet image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Kraken will now hand out millions of dollars in the virtual currency to some of those who lost out at the (alleged) hands of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles and company.\n\nThe claims stem from the 2014 implosion of the world\'s largest Bitcoin exchange. The $91m represents the scraps of digital currency MtGox held before the bankrupt biz was frozen – and Kraken is now handing over those remaining Bitcoins to some of those stiffed during the financial crisis.\n\n""During our thorough bankruptcy investigation, we have carefully reviewed over 24,000 individual claims and made individual determinations on their validity,"" said trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi.\n\n""In the near future, claimants will be able to browse the MtGox claims website to confirm their status.""\n\nAt the time of its bankruptcy, MtGox said that more than 650,000 Bitcoins had gone missing: at today\'s price of $448 apiece, that haul amounts to $291.2m.\n\nKraken said that to date, more than 24,000 claims have been filed, with claimants seeking exactly $2,411,412,137,427 in total losses. However, the exchange noted that many of those claims – including a single filing for more than 2 trillion Yen in lost Bitcoin – had been denied.\n\nOriginally a Magic: The Gathering exchange site, MtGox arose as the largest exchange market for Bitcoins and subsequently failed after administrators claimed the site had fallen victim to a massive cyberattack resulting in the loss of customer deposits.\n\nFallout from the case led to class action lawsuits against MtGox and criminal charges against CEO Mark Karpeles. ®', 'Forget what you know about Silicon Valley and the Canton of Zug. There’s a new blockchain and digital currency hub growing in the Emerald Isle of Ireland. In fact, Dublin is steadily becoming a place that has firm support, education and industry infrastructure within the cryptocurrency and digital ledger phenomena.\n\nDeloitte Establishes R&D Team Providing 50 Blockchain Jobs in Dublin\n\nIreland is continuously on the horizon of technological innovation and is becoming quite the player within the rapidly growing Fintech global arena. Major technology players such as Google, Facebook, Paypal and many others have operations in the region and confidence is high between legacy financial institutions and the technology sector. The rise of research and development (R&D) of blockchain technology is also thriving within the country’s borders.\n\nJust recently the financial management and consultancy firm Deloitte has announced it will create blockchain R&D department in Dublin. The group plans to construct a team of 50 developers in the next year and a half focused on the distributed ledger technology sector. However, it may take time as Deloitte Ireland’s head of financial services David Dalton told press skills in the blockchain field are still “quite rare.”\n\nDalton also details that Deloitte is already working on 20 different blockchain prototypes that cover a broad range of applications. Some of the technology being created use smart contract technology as well. Deloitte wants developers who understand the young technology in order to stimulate ideas, and standard practices. The consultancy will work within the proof-of-concept stages, but Dalton believes soon all major players will be involved with this technology. Dalton said in the announcement:\n\n“This is relatively immature technology and one that is still in its early stage of development. There’s a long way to go until the standards are established as a platform,”\n\nThe Dublin-Based Circle Financial Spreads its Wings in the UK\n\nAnother company that works with Bitcoin directly is Circle Financial, who also have international headquarters located in Dublin. Circle is similar to Coinbase and has been becoming well known as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. The Dublin-based company has so far raised $76 million USD in funding rounds and also has offices located in the heart of Boston which also has a great deal of Irish population. The company is heavily backed by the legacy institution Goldman Sachs and alongside its Dublin offices, it also plans to work in London so it can expand throughout the entire UK. CEO Jeremy Allaire and co-founder Sean Neville were recently in London scouting for a country manager and is in discussions with UK regulators. Circle has been operating since 2013 and is one of the largest funded cryptocurrency firms working within the Irish landscape.\n\nBlockchain & Digital Currency Academics Thrive in Ireland\n\nBlockchain education and academic research is also blossoming in Ireland. At the beginning of the year, an event called the Economics forum Cantillon 2016 was held by the Centre for Entrepreneurship & Enterprise Development (CEED) focusing on fintech and blockchain solutions. The event at the Institute of Technology Tralee had a broad range of Bitcoin evangelists including Coinality’s Dan Roseman, who spoke to the audience about the growing cryptocurrency employment opportunities within the industry. Alongside discussions about financial tech, Ms. Jan Skoyles of the The Real Asset Company gave the Irish crowd an introduction to cryptocurrency and crowdfunding.\n\nOn the 21st April, at the University, College Dublin Centre for Innovation and Technology (UCD) held a conference called Translating the Blockchain. The event was organized by the group CodingGrace and had speakers such as UCD’s Gianluca Miscione, and Paul Ennis, Deloitte’s Lory Kehoe and Cillian Leonowicz, and Stephen Wingreen all discussing the importance of blockchain technology. Topics included legal and regulatory policy, technical issues, ethical implications, governance, accounting, fintech, cybercrime, and decentralized applications.\n\nBitcoin is Very Popular Within the Emerald Isle Borders\n\nBitcoin use is also quite popular in the region as the organization Bitcoin Dublin has regular meetup groups. According to Coin ATM Radar Dublin has two working Bitcoin automated tellers as well in the city. Then there’s the Bitcoin Association of Ireland founded in 2013 that promotes cryptocurrency awareness throughout the country. The nonprofit organization has signed up a bunch of merchants to accept the cryptocurrency including an e-cigarette supplier, bedding business, a B&B, phone shop, and CCTV. Alongside meetup groups and the Foundation, Ireland also has it’s share of Bitcoin exchanges such as BitEx.ie which considers itself Ireland’s premiere destination to purchase and sell Bitcoin. The company set up the first Bitcoin ATM in Dublin and has a digital currency-based iPad application for merchants.\n\nDublin is growing to be a well-recognized fintech and cryptocurrency hub within the UK. Many parts of Europe and especially London has been said by the press to be the hotspots of financial tech innovation. Well, it seems Ireland is also sizzling with flourishing growth as well and aims to be a top destination when it comes to these technologies.\n\nSource: Yahoo Finance, Bitcoin Association of Ireland, Forbes, BitEx.ie', 'IBM has recently announced that it has opened up its 5-qubit quantum computer to the general public. Has quantum computing finally arrived and what impact will it have on Bitcoin?\n\nQuantum computers\n\nQuantum computers represent a new paradigm in computing.\n\nWhile traditional digital computers store data in binary bits (zero or one), quantum computers store data in the form of qubits (where 2 data states can be superimposed.).\n\nThis enables large scale quantum computers to solve certain mathematical problems in a much more efficient way compared to traditional computers.\n\nAsymmetric cryptography - the key to Bitcoin\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol uses asymmetric cryptography to ensure that bitcoins can only be spent by their rightful owner. Transactions signed by a private key can be verified using the corresponding public key.\n\nBrute forcing private keys corresponding to a given public key using currently available computers is infeasible. While bitcoins have been lost by users to hackers, it is mainly due to the unsafe security practices of users.\n\nHowever, asymmetric cryptography is one of the problems that can be solved efficiently by an effective quantum computer.\n\nEffective quantum computers not imminent\n\nThe power of quantum computers increases exponentially with the increase in number of qubits. The processor built by IBM is a 5-qubit processor, which is great to demonstrate the concept of quantum computing.\n\nThe real power of quantum computing can be unleashed only when the number of qubits increases.\n\nAccording to The Economist, a 300-qubit quantum computer can have more possible states than the number of atoms in this universe. These computers are, however, some time away from being built.\n\nBitcoin can evolve to tackle this threat\n\nEven if effective quantum computers are created, it is unlikely that this threat would materialize overnight.\n\nHence, there could be a transition to a quantum-resistant algorithm in an orderly manner. The Bitcoin protocol could incorporate a new algorithm to be implemented after a certain block number, by which time all nodes would have to update the software they run.\n\nDustin Moody, mathematician at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), says:\n\n""There has been a lot of research into quantum computers in recent years, and everyone from major computer companies to the government want their cryptographic algorithms to be what we call \'quantum resistant\'. So if and when someone does build a large-scale quantum computer, we want to have algorithms in place that it can\'t crack.""\n\nEffective quantum computers – other implications\n\nCryptography is prevalent everywhere and is used for encrypting messages, emails as well as other forms of data. Banks use cryptography as well, although in a centralized manner.\n\nHence if quantum computers capable of breaking Bitcoin are indeed developed, they would also be a risk to banks and would have far reaching consequences.', 'An investigation by Spanish authorities into the illegal distribution of paid television content has resulted in the seizure and destruction of six bitcoin mines used to launder proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nEuropean law enforcement agency Europol, which took part in the investigation, said today that 30 individuals had been arrested during an operation on 18th May. Thirty-eight homes across seven Spanish cities, including Madrid, were searched during the event, according to the agency.\n\nAccording to Reuters, those operating the bitcoin mines based in Spain were stealing power to fuel those efforts, citing a statement from Spanish police. Discovery of the bitcoin mines reportedly occurred as Spanish tax authorities investigated the alleged scheme.\n\nMining is an energy intensive process of confirming transactions on bitcoin’s public ledger, the blockchain. Money is made when the proceeds from selling bitcoins (or other cryptocurrencies) exceeds the cost of the electricity used.\n\nAmong the items seized: roughly $35,000 in bitcoin, ten luxury vehicles and a private aircraft. Authorities also seized about 184,000 euros, as well as nearly 50,000 decoders used to access otherwise restricted TV content.\n\nFurther, a photo included with Europol’s release shows several of the machines seized from one of the mines.\n\nEuropol said that the alleged effort to distribute paid-for TV content stretched across the globe, involving decoder exporters from China as well as a network of servers based throughout Europe.\n\n""This operation shows that these types of crimes are not left unpunished,” Michael Rauschenbach, head of serious and organized crime for Europol, said in a statement.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Notwithstanding, Australian stakeholders and government want this technology to be sustainable in the long-term. ISO and its members have an important role to play in making this a reality. ...The proposed international standards for blockchain will focus on technical solutions that promote interoperability, and compatibility between existing systems. This will allow the technology to be more widely used and deployed.”\n\nBitcoin Is a Standard\n\nAs the “invisible ships” lore (or myth) goes: Native Americans could not perceive the fleet of ships about to invade their homeland because the armada was so alien to their collective experiences that they were unable to see their aggressors. One could make a similar comparison with groups seeking to standardize blockchains. Public blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum are in and of themselves protocols or standards. Institutions that are trying to (re)define what a blockchain is in the name of standardization are trying to co-opt the technology and may not even realize that they are staring at a standard. A blockchain with(in) a layer of standards is a paradox. This governance creates a needless metalayer of friction and complexity. However, while Bitcoin is a standard, its decentralized nature means that it has no formal structure. That said, Bitcoin utilizes a BIP or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal as the de facto way of introducing features (via Github).\n\nIn fact, BIP 123, or “BIP Classification” created by Bitcoin Core Developer Eric Lombrozo explains that:\n\n“Bitcoin is a system involving a number of different standards. Some standards are absolute requirements for interoperability while others can be considered optional, giving implementors a choice of whether to support them. In order to have a BIP process which more closely reflects the interoperability requirements, it is necessary to categorize BIPs. …”\n\nA Chip Off the Old Blockchain?\n\nBitcoin is no stranger to ISO or standardization for that matter. Back in 2014, Jon Matonis, then the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, penned an article for CoinDesk “Why Bitcoin Needs an ISO-Certified Currency Code.” The Bitcoin Foundation for its part was founded with standardization in its vision. According to its words at the time, “[The] Bitcoin Foundation standardizes, protects and promotes the use of Bitcoin cryptographic money for the benefit of users worldwide.”\n\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with Manu Sporny, chairman of the W3C Web Payments Community Group and CEO of Digital Bazaar. The W3C or The World Wide Web Consortium is the international standards organization for the World Wide Web. When calling Bitcoin a standard Sporny said:\n\n“It depends on if you are talking about ‘de jure’ standards or ‘de facto’ standards. Bitcoin could be argued to be a ‘de facto’ standard, but even that argument is a bit weak since systems like Ethereum exist. When you have a standard, you're looking for true interoperability. That is, multiple companies can follow the standard and come up with systems that interoperate. The Web is a good example of a set of interoperable standards. Bitcoin hasn't hit that point yet, as much of the control over the core of Bitcoin is in the hands of very few developers and one major reference implementation. I think it's shaky to call Bitcoin a standard. It's a really interesting experiment.”\n\nMeanwhile, Sporny notes that W3C has a Blockchain standardization workshop, Blockchains and the Web: A W3C Workshop on Distributed Ledgers on the Web scheduled on June 29–30 at MIT Media Lab.\n\nDown Under\n\nThe Australian proposal mentions leveraging pre-existing standards such as ISO 20022 which “defines the fields and controls within messages and transaction between entities thus allowing interoperability.” However, this was on the heels of Reuters' news story that hackers compromised the SWIFT software of Bangladesh Bank.\n\nWhile Standards Australia notes that, “The work will exclude legal obligations and regulatory matters addressed by government jurisdictions,” it also proposes to “Embed compliance to money laundering and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.”\n\nStakeholders\n\nThe proposal is just one of many blockchain land grabs by legacy actors trying to stay relevant in a world of Bitcoin governance.

His company approached the desktop bitcoin wallet maker with the idea a few weeks ago, and it was open to discussions.\n\n“MultiBit has excellent KeepKey support, and offers many advanced features that our Chrome extension doesn’t offer,” Stanchfield explained. “We target our Chrome extension to new bitcoin users whereas MultiBit is geared for the well-weathered bitcoiner. We believe users should have choices, and this filled the obvious need for our bitcoin-versed customers. MultiBit also works without a hardware wallet, and still offers this best security you can get in a hardware-free setup.”\n\nKeepKey values privacy just as much as security, and MultiBit has made recent moves to prioritize privacy.\n\nIn February, the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project released its second report rating bitcoin wallets. Out of 20 wallets ranked, the MultiBit HD wallet placed 11th. The report noted the wallet had a “unique privacy quirk” in which, by default, one out of every several transactions included a small donation out to the wallet’s developers.\n\nStanchfield told CoinReport MultiBit had discontinued its fee collection mechanism, known as BRIT, in April, enhancing privacy even more. According to MultiBit’s website, BRIT has been removed in version 0.3.0 and higher.\n\n“MultiBit used the BRIT feature to fund the development. All small amount of bitcoin would be sent to MultiBit every several transactions,” Stanchfield explained. He added, “This is not ideal for privacy because anyone can look at the blockchain and through careful analysis determine that MultiBit wallets were being used by linking through the MultiBit donation address. By the time we approached MultiBit, the feature had been removed.”\n\nIf KeepKey’s wallet had been included in the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project report, Stanchfield believes it would have ranked high.\n\n“Security and privacy are top factors whenever we consider how features will be implemented,” he said. “For example, KeepKey Chrome Wallet supports multiple accounts that can be named (“Bitcoin Savings” and “Rainy Day Fund.”) This meta information is encrypted using KeepKey, in the background and automatically. Without an attached KeepKey which has been actively authenticated with a PIN, this meta information cannot be viewed.”\n\nNow with KeepKey’s involvement with MultiBit, “you can expect to see continued focus on privacy,” Stanchfield said. “For example, we have an immediate plan to add CoinJoin support to MultiBit, and users can expect to see that in the coming months. As far as I know, we are the first desktop client to have this on the roadmap.”\n\nKeepKey’s guiding principle, Stanchfield explained, is financial counterparties should not be opaque parties, and instead should employ open source hardware and software, allowing for transparency and third party validation.\n\n“With our acquisition of MultiBit, KeepKey can now serve this promise of trustless finance to many more people, including those who cannot justify a dedicated hardware solution,” he said. “At the same time, it solidifies a pro-feature solution for our current KeepKey customers.”\n\nIn a blog post about the acquisition, MultiBit’s developers said KeepKey is committed to maintaining MultiBit HD as an open source MIT license project going forward. Both parties agree that MultiBit Class has “reached the end of its life,” the blog post said, with the developers encouraging those still using Classic to migrate to HD as soon as possible.\n\nMultiBit considers KeepKey “excellent custodians” of its product going forward, said MultiBit CEO Gary Rowe in a press release sent to CoinReport. “We are moving on to other projects and are delighted that the KeepKey team have stepped up to continue development of our software. Their commitment means that existing users can continue to use Bitcoin with confidence.”\n\nThe choice to make the deal entirely with bitcoin was clear for both parties, said Stanchfield, explaining that KeepKey hadn’t converted the bitcoin it received from product sales. The company is always searching for opportunities to use the digital currency with its suppliers and vendors. The transaction had near instant settlement with bitcoin, he said, so MultiBit did not have to wait for funds to clear at its bank.\n\nMultiBit users should expect to receive immediately the same dedicated customer support KeepKey offers its hardware clients, said Stanchfield. “MultiBit will remain one of the best desktop wallet clients available, and we will keep it 100% free and open source.”\n\nHe added, “Going forward, KeepKey will continue to work toward making trustless finance easy for everyone. ‘Easy’ encompasses a lot of things: great security and great privacy that just work so that users do not have adjust settings or know how it is working for it function perfectly.”\n\nImages courtesy of KeepKey via PR firm Wachsman PR']"

The reason for that is that bears of a larger calibre could appear around $452. In that case, Bitcoin’s price will rebound, and stand a chance to form a downward trend. The necessary confirmation for a turn to decline is a disruption of the structure of the upward trend. The level of $444.5 was confirmed by the previous rebound. If you draw the diagonal channel, the key point can be found where it crosses the Fibonacci level 61.\n\nIn order for a chance for a turn to decline to maximize, Bitcoin’s price has to rebound from the level of $452 and form a turn at the level of $444.5.

Further, by gathering data from more than one location, users could collectively build a comprehensive weather map for a particular region.\n\nThe company explained:\n\n""With this short set of commands, you were able to turn a small sensor into a passive income stream. The value from the sensor comes from the fact that it is not locked up in a datacenter like a cloud computer, but out in the real world and part of a compute grid.""\n\nThe goal that 21 is moving toward is one whereby individuals are ultimately incentivized to share all sorts of data, whether it is the weather or radiation levels collected with a Geiger counter.\n\n""At the end of the day, a Geiger counter is just an electrical sensor. So capturing the data, managing it with a local database and setting it up for sale will be very similar for other sensors,"" 21 engineer Tyler Pate told CoinDesk.\n\nThe example comes in the midst of a more active period of announcements from 21 aimed at showcasing the work ongoing internally and its vision for bitcoin in the Internet of Things, or the goal of connecting all manner of non-computing devices to the Internet.\n\nIn March, 21 introduced a similar proof-of-concept called Ping21, which found the startup proposing how a grid computing network with micropayments incentives could help webmasters better monitor the status of global websites.\n\nFurther, at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2016 conference, 21 made its software package available for free, a development that means all computer users can now run software that was previously only available to users of the 21 Bitcoin Computer.\n\nExpanded use cases\n\nStill, 21 envisions how such a network could come to carry out beneficial societal functions, including helping rescue workers better respond during emergencies.\n\nIn the event of a meltdown at a nuclear power plant, such as what occurred at the Fukushima facility in Japan in 2011, a grid network would be able to efficiently collect information on levels of radiation, giving response workers up-to-date information about potential dangers.\n\nThis kind of tool could also be used to prevent future disasters as well.\n\nPate explained that one of the potential uses could have been in Flint, Michigan, and that such a network could have gathered water samples to determine quantities of lead.

The amount claimed amounted to $2,411,412,137,427 in total losses.\n\nHowever, the total amount of Bitcoin still held by Mt. Gox amounts to just over $91 million at today\'s price of approximately $450, which will be distributed to genuine claimants.\n\nKraken, which oversees what is left of the collapsed exchange, also noted that one claim made by an individual for 260 trillion yen will likely be denied.\n\nMany investors of the once-dominant Bitcoin exchange have been left without direction since Mt. Gox closed its doors without warning in 2014. Ran by former chief Mark Karpeles, Mt.

It was during the Cold War that a lack of transparency led to a breakdown of trust between countries, and one of the objectives of these games was to find ways to ensure that too much power was never given to any one individual or group.\n\nThe new project by BunkerChain Labs, codenamed “Peerplays,” uses a high-speed program called Graphene to automatically connect players from around the world, enabling online gaming and wagering that is highly resistant to cheating.\n\nTwo years in the making, the project began with delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS), a decentralized autonomous cooperative organization (DAC or DAO) supporting protocol that was developed by Invictus Innovations, Inc., which later became Cryptonomex, for BitShares in the spring of 2014. A year later, a modified and improved version of the DPoS Graphene was released under the MIT free software license, with some of the Peerplays team taking part in its development.\n\n“The Peerplays team began to design and implement a platform that combines Graphene with a set of smart contracts that enables users to wager and compete in provably fair games, which are hosted directly on the blockchain,” said Michael P. Maloney, Peerplays communications manager, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nIt was in the fall of 2015 that Neil Haran, the Peerplays project lead, approached BunkerChain Labs, to discuss the possibility of using blockchain technology to build a transparent and provably fair wagering platform that would eliminate the ability for unchecked “superpowers” to control and manipulate the games.\n\n“Today, the online gaming industry is plagued with accusations of cheating by players and system administrators, but nothing can really be done about it as long as games lack transparency and continue to be hosted by private companies on private servers,” said Maloney.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, BunkerChain Labs, took the idea to the developers who helped create Graphene, and who began to design and implement a blockchain-based platform to solve the problem before going public on May 9.\n\nBuilt on a custom blockchain, Peerplays is possible because of third-party services known as “gateways.”\n\n“Gateways issue tokens backed by Bitcoin onto the Peerplays decentralized exchange, and players can then purchase or redeem these tokens like exchanging money for chips at a casino,” said Maloney. “Right now there are many reputable companies that operate gateways on existing decentralized exchanges like BitShares and NXT.”\n\nUnlike the supercomputer called WOPR in the 1983 hit movie, “War Games,” which mistook a computer game for real-life and almost set off a global thermonuclear war, Peerplays is programmed to remain neutral. As Peerplays is a decentralized network, with no single gaming company gaining an advantage or monopoly over it, it seeks to be a major disruptor to the online gaming industry. However, it’s not limited to on-chain games.\n\n“In fact anyone can plug their website into the blockchain API and Peerplays will manage tournaments and process wagers for third-party games,” said Maloney. “This will help tournament hosting companies to reduce their costs while minimizing the liabilities and risks involved with managing the infrastructure required to operate a centralized gaming and wagering platform.”\n\nUnlike war in the real world, the peer-to-peer war games enabled by Peerplays will ensure that the winner can’t go back and rewrite the official record of what took place, as it is completely open-source and 100 percent transparent. Not only that, but Peerplays will be the first blockchain-based platform that allows users to schedule tournaments, wager funds and play games 100 percent on-chain.\n\n“Anyone in the world with Internet access will be able to use Peerplays to wager and compete, while all their funds are held safely out of reach of any third party,” said Maloney. “Peerplays’ provably fair gaming could help reduce the estimated tens of millions of dollars that fair players lose to cheaters each year.”', 'We are going to start off this morning’s analysis with a daily chart. It’s little more expansive a time frame than we normally focus on, but it offers us some insight, so it’s worth looking at quickly. As the chart below shows, action in the bitcoin price has, over the last few weeks, formed something of a triangle at the end of an upside run. We are going to use this triangle to help form our bias today – specifically, a break of the triangle’s outer perimeters (in either direction) will dictate our medium to long-term bias in the bitcoin price.\n\nFor our intraday strategy, however and as we head into a fresh European session this morning, let’s look at a more focused timeframe. The chart below shows the same action, but on a 15-minute candlestick chart, and only showing the last 24 hours or so of price action rather than the last few weeks’ worth.\n\nAs you see from the chart, action has been pretty up and down over the last couple of days, but it has given us some well-defined levels to focus on. Specifically, these are in term support at 451.71 and resistance to the upside at 455.48. Price is currently trading just shy of the latter of these two levels, and so we will look at a potential upside break first. If price closes above resistance it will signal a long entry towards an initial upside target of 464. A stop loss on this one somewhere in the region of 453.5 will keep things tight to the downside from a risk management perspective.\n\nLooking the other way, if price runs down toward support, and breaks (and closes) below this level, we will look to enter short towards a medium-term downside target of 445. Again we need a stop loss, and somewhere in the region of 453 looks good.\n\nHappy Trading!\n\nCharts courtesy of SimpleFX\n\nImage courtesy of NewsBTC\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

He is accused of illegal dealings in the virtual currency known as Bitcoin. David Ovalle Miami Herald', 'The price of bitcoin appreciated nearly 4% for the week ending 27th May, but the figure is perhaps not indicative of the wild trading action the market saw during the period.\n\nSuch movements came as market observers are becoming more interested in the relationship between bitcoin, the token supporting the world\'s longest-running blockchain, and ether, the token for the Ethereum platform.\n\nBitcoin\'s gains, for example, came as ether prices plunged sharply, but it made this climb amid modest trading volumes. By contrast, ether enjoyed robust transaction activity, a sign that points to a potential migration of traders away from bitcoin.\n\nMany market observers are beginning to suggest that these two digital currencies display a negative correlation. Since they both have their respective strengths and weaknesses, and each is publicly traded, experts have begun weighing in on the value of each as an investment.\n\nThis perceived competition may not be over any time soon, and one market watcher emphasized that both currencies have quite a bit of potential.\n\n""It is still early to call the winner at this stage,"" Toya Zhang, senior PR Manager for OKCoin, told CoinDesk.\n\nWhile developers have created many cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was the first one to reach scale – but some are beginning to think that this state of affairs might change.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, said:\n\n""[There are now] serious concerns about whether [bitcoin] can do thousands of transactions a second and whether it’s robust enough for widespread use.""\n\nEther, which operates at a far smaller scale than bitcoin, does not currently face such challenges. Further, supporters have asserted that ether has far more flexibility and potential than bitcoin, as Ethereum is proving capable of supporting a broader range of applications than bitcoin’s code.\n\nHowever, ether has done far less to prove itself than bitcoin, as the latter currency has long dominated the space. If a digital asset wants to achieve widespread adoption, this ""requires continuous progress,"" Zhang continued.\n\nWhile any forward-looking predictions are purely speculative in nature, hard data – involving both price movements and volumes – can provide a better understanding of market activity.\n\nBitcoin’s modest climb\n\nOver the week, bitcoin prices rose 3.9% from $436.73 at 12:00 UTC on 20th May to $453.82 on 27th May, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal.\n\nHowever, the digital currency’s price fluctuated between $440 and $450 for most of the week until Friday. These fluctuations coincided with lackluster volume of 7.6m BTC during the seven days through 12:00 UTC on 27th May.\n\n""Bitcoin trading volume is flat,"" Petar Zivkovski, director of operations at full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk at the time.\n\nHe added:\n\n""There\'s no clear trend as market players exhibit uncertainty on future price direction, torn between the relatively bullish news of the upcoming supply production halving in July, and the relatively bearish news of Ethereum emerging as a competing and superior currency.""\n\nHowever, this soon changed, as observers reported a sharp decline in short positions that caused the subsequent price breakout that reached highs not seen since last fall. At press time, bitcoin is trading at $473.20.\n\nEther’s plunge\n\nEther prices, by contrast, declined 14% during the seven days through 12:00 UTC on 27th May.\n\nWhile the digital currency began the period at $14.31, it ended a week of trading by falling well below $12 per ether at press time. These price movements took place as ether’s day-end, 24-hour trading volume fluctuated significantly.\n\nThe week started out strong, with volume of $53.8m at 23:59 on 19th May, CoinMarketCap figures reveal. However, this measure fell to as little as $17.9m at 23:59 on 22nd May and finished the week at $20.7m.\n\nThe currency’s recent drop – and bitcoin’s rally – can be attributed to market participants front-running The DAO’s raising of money, claimed George Samman, a blockchain advisor and consultant.\n\nSamman argued that market participants sold their ether holdings after the recent rally, purchasing bitcoin soon after.\n\nSuch speculations, while unconfirmed, nonetheless remain indicative that market participants are beginning to more closely scrutinize the nature between the two markets.\n\nWas ether\'s loss bitcoin\'s gain?

Once the halving takes place, the subsidy will drop to 12.5 BTC – an event that effectively cuts a miner’s bitcoin income by half.\n\nCole told CoinDesk:\n\n""Effectively our cost of coin – how much we produce the coins for – will be over the market price. The price is now [roughly] $480. With all of our overhead, after July, the cost will be over $480. All of the liabilities we’ll have after that time will be too high.""\n\nHe said the move to bankruptcy was a pre-emptive one taken by KnC’s board of directors, explaining that the firm wanted to avoid running out of funds prior to the drop in revenue.\n\nFollowing the decision, KnC said it will now seek to sell off profitable aspects of the company, but did not specify which parts of its business would be auctioned.

The process will require a person’s identification in order ""to minimize anonymous transfers.""\n\nRosfinmonitoring has reportedly started talks with the Finance Ministry and Central Bank officials on the idea.\n\nHead of the Russian Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin said in April that the spread of international cryptocurrencies could force legal money from the market, creating a threat to the financial stability of Russia.', ""The world economy is in a fascinating period. It is an encouraging time for those hopeful about Bitcoin and other open blockchain-based systems, but many high-level decision-makers still must be persuaded of this technology's global impact.\n\nThe United States seems to be doing fine in the aftermath of 2008’s Great Recession. Despite technological change causing some workforce pain, the U.S. economy is doing well.\n\nBut other parts of the world are still feeling some nasty economic aftereffects. Some might say this is due to colorful central banking policies. One of these policies is negative interest rates imposed by various central banks around the world.\n\nThe idea of negative interest rate policy becoming normal is concerning, as this could set a dangerous precedent for the global economy. At the same time, it provides an opportunity for alternatives to thrive. Negative interest rates could actually influence enormous growth for cryptographically backed open blockchain assets.\n\nNegative Interest Rate Problems\n\nSweden, Switzerland and Japan are among countries currently enforcing negative interest rate policies. Negative interest rates, which essentially charge savers a fee to put their money in a bank, are set to induce borrowing to stimulate a sagging economy. They are also a reason for central banks to print more cash, popularly known as quantitative easing.\n\nOver time, negative interest rate policy results in bank holdings being worth less. Therefore, it is arguable that this is not really a solution, but a stopgap until something else comes along. Some have described this policy as medicine for a “weak patient.” This refers to the concept that negative interest rates can’t heal what has already been broken for too long.\n\nEurope has become a popular place for negative interest rates.\n\nNegative interest rate policy forces people to look for alternatives and creates a need for services that can reflect growth rather than contraction. Retail banking relies on everyone storing cash in bank accounts, but in a negative interest rate world, people are better off borrowing money than they are saving.\n\nIn the standard fractional reserve environment, banks rely on savings to lend. Yet holding cash, for most people, is actually more lucrative in a negative interest rate environment. Even when factoring in inflation, there is long-term value in holding cash rather than putting it in a bank imposing a negative interest rate. But physical cash can be tough to hold because of security and storage issues.\n\nMany countries believe negative interest rates are a benefit to their economies. The common mindset is that these policies are staving off even more economic problems. Distributed blockchain-based assets are clearly an attractive option in this scenario.\n\nChoices Over Traditional Assets\n\nAs an early stage technology, Bitcoin and open blockchain are in growth mode. This is especially true since it’s not clear what long-term impact negative interest rates will have on banking. People seeking financial alternatives should be aware that there are options over traditional assets.\n\nBitcoin is no longer the only viable open digital currency option, with platforms such as Ethereum also offering a promising choice. With impressive performance metrics and many developers working on Ethereum projects, that choice benefits everyone. The back-end of open blockchain tech is looking more promising than ever.\n\nEthereum, with 14-second block times, is an attractive alternative to BTC.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been performing well as a store of value. Ethereum’s price performance in 2016 has been remarkable, and the fiat-to-open-blockchain exchange infrastructure around the world continues to improve.\n\nBecause of these factors, there has never been a better time to invest in and use cryptographically backed open assets. Companies such as Circle, Abra and Lawnmower are making it easier to use borderless forms of money. These startups offer a solid premise: open banking, done entirely on a digital device.\n\nOpen digital assets could provide a salvo from economic problems like negative interest rates. They can be an alternative to less transparent cash-based systems. However, there is still work to be done. This growing ecosystem still requires understanding by influential leaders to achieve widespread success.\n\nChampioning Bitcoin and Blockchain\n\nGiven the growth of Bitcoin and blockchain, new application platforms will emerge from these technologies. Global economic conditions resulting in negative interest rates certainly provide some motivation for this. But there are still obstacles to overcome for open blockchain platforms to succeed.\n\nIn Steve Case’s new book, The Third Wave, the AOL cofounder discusses today’s era of technology. In the “third wave,” current technological entrepreneurs must work to champion Bitcoin and blockchain to global leaders. This is similar to the work Case had to do at AOL in the 1990s, where he fought hard to convince regulators that the Internet would become an enormous economic opportunity.\n\nToday, entrepreneurs must educate about the importance of Bitcoin and open blockchain. This means promoting it as an engine of economic growth and financial inclusion.\n\nThe challenge today is convincing others that this open technology is needed in economic systems. That will take dedication to developing inventive applications to solve global economic problems.\n\nTransparency, combined with tools such as programmable agreements, ranks among the most exciting characteristics of open blockchain assets. As such, these assets should be considered highly impactful to the future of the global economy. In the case of negative interest rate policies, it is obvious that new solutions to economic problems are necessary.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum and other open blockchain systems now exist to help make that happen.\n\nEditor's note: This is a guest post by Daniel Cawrey and the opinions offered are those of the author."", 'Recently I came by a tweet by Andreas Antonopoulos stating:\n\nWhich got me thinking - can Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency be seen as a Bitcoin rival?\n\nBitcoin vs fiat\n\nFirst, lets look at how Bitcoin competes with fiat.\n\nLooking at the definition, a rival is defined as ""A competitor with the same goal as another, or striving to attain the same thing. Defeating a rival may be a primary or necessary goal of a competitor."" and ""Someone or something with similar claims of quality or distinction as another."".\n\n\n\nWhen talking about most fiat currencies like USD, Euro, GBP, etc., or hard assets like Gold or Silver, it might be hard to call Bitcoin a rival to those, at least so far. A lot of national and international currencies exist to facilitate trade, government programs, taxes, etc. on a scale where Bitcoin doesn\'t register yet. Previous metals are similarly used for some trade, as well as store of value, speculation, etc.\n\nWhile Bitcoin can fulfil similar niches as those currencies, the currency would first need to rise in value a few orders of magnitude to be able to compete on the same scene. In the future, Bitcoin may be seen as a competitor to USD or Gold, but it will probably take awhile. That, however, doesn\'t stop it from filling in some other niches.\n\nBitcoin in various applications\n\nWhile Bitcoin might not compete against Gold or USD, it can still catch the attention of some gold bugs, internet sellers, or the unbankables. Bitcoin might be too small to compete in the primary markets of companies like PayPal or Western Union, but it seems to be catching up in the more fringe markets.\n\nBitcoin vs altcoins\n\nBitcoin\'s most direct rivals would be the various altcoins.\n\n\n\nLooking at the current cryptocurrency market, we have Bitcoin at $7.4B market cap, Ethereum at $1B, Ripple at $576M and Litecoin at $202M, with every other coin having substantially less than $100M.\n\n\n\nBitcoin\'s most direct competitor feature-wise would be Litecoin, sitting at 1/38th of the market cap. While it might be a notable currency for speculation, there doesn\'t seem to be as much adoption and development push from within and without the Litecoin community to say that LTC is competing with BTC. As such, it doesn\'t look like a potential rival for Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nRipple, due to the centralized control of its XRP tokens, can never hope to compete with Bitcoin. Similar to Omni and Counterparty, it might be better suited to be a Bitcoin compliment - dealing with user-created currencies, while leaving Bitcoin to be the decentralized currency.\n\n\n\nThis leaves us with the main topic - Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin vs Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a bit of a mixed bag. Its genesis block started with ~72M ETH being created for the presale (~60M ETH), the developers, and the Ethereum foundation (~12M ETH). With the current supply of 80M ETH, that presale constitutes a large chunk of the total ethers in circulation. Some might see that as premining, while others, like myself, don\'t see similar presales as such.\n\n\n\nEthers also aren\'t always viewed as currency, but rather as a token for executing code on Ethereum. While that might be true and some core developers might say that for legal reasons (to protect themselves from any legal fallout from the token presale), it hasn\'t stopped people from speculating on the value and bringing the value up more than 10 fold in the last year.\n\n\n\nLastly, Ethereum does a lot more with its scripting language than what Bitcoin can. Until we get something like sidechains up and running, Bitcoin will probably not be Ethereum\'s rival anytime soon.\n\n\n\nHowever, the opposite might not be true. Ethereum has 1/7th the market supply of Bitcoin, a large community around the world, and is starting to get high-profile projects like The DAO. As such, Ethereum is shaping up to be a rival to Bitcoin.\n\nThe rivalry\n\nWith all of that being said, Ethereum and Bitcoin filling the same niche of decentralized internet currency might not be too bad. Both of the currencies still have bigger opponents to overcome on their way up - fiats, precious metals, centralized payment processors taking big cuts, etc. Success of one might not mean the loss of other. As long as both communities remain on good terms, developers, exchanges, and other crypto businesses are open to accepting both currencies, and we keep our eyes on the same target of overcoming the old way of banking, there is no reason why this rivalry couldn\'t be a friendly coopetition.\n\nConclusions\n\nBitcoin is not yet a rival to the big fiats or precious metals, as it is too small to register. Most altcoins aren\'t big enough to compete with Bitcoin. Ethereum is a potential rival to Bitcoin, but there is no reason for competing directly with one another when there are old currencies and use cases to take on first.', 'The USA PATRIOT Act required that all banks in the United States verify the identities of their depositors, in order to undermine the ability of terrorists to use our financial system. So it’s ironic that Andreas Antonopoulos called the practice “dangerous” in a YouTube post that went up recently. The concept has come to be known as “know your customer,” or “KYC.” It’s bandied about a lot at fintech and bitcoin gatherings.\n\nMr. Antonopoulos wrote Mastering Bitcoin for O’Reilly Media, a company with a knack for publishing the definitive works on technical topics. So it’s fair to say that the man who wrote the book on bitcoin believes KYC does more to imperil consumers than protect them, yet the New York Department of Financial Services put KYC at the heart of the cryptocurrency license it released last year, known to bitcoin entrepreneurs as “BitLicense.”\n\nStartups that want to provide financial services via bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in the state will need to prove they can verify identities. As the financial capital of the country and the first state to act on these currencies, several sources in the cryptocurrency community have told the Observer that they expect other states and countries will use BitLicense as a model regulation.\n\n“The idea that some bitcoin startup is going to start doing some know your customer and anti-money laundering, collecting all that personal identification,” Mr. Antonopoulos says in the video, “that’s both ridiculous and disastrous, because what will happen is that information will leak.”\n\nI personally tried to open my first bitcoin account on Gemini recently, the most pro-regulation of the bitcoin companies. It required a scan of both my government issued ID and a bill that showed my address. I get my bills digitally, and the utility companies are the most cumbersome. So I tried a tax bill, which I had on paper, which was rejected. I tried an internet service bill, and that was also rejected. That was two documents sent over the internet too many, so I gave up. It was my little taste of KYC in action. It was a bad taste.\n\n“Bitcoin doesn’t require you to identify yourself, and that is not a bug. That is a feature,” Mr. Antonopoulos says. He goes on to explain that when regulators require banks to collect personally identifiable information, they invite hacks.\n\nBitcoin has a different solution: no information, no hacks. Bitcoin is owned by wallets that people control with encryption. In that way, it works just like real wallets. If I take $20 from my wallet to pay you for a high-five, the transaction is complete as soon as it goes into your wallet. I don’t need to know your name. I don’t even need to see your face (just your hand).\n\nMr. Antonopoulos made the remarks during a question and answer session following a talk he gave in Barcelona in March. In it, he accused governments of using terrorism as a pretext for creating a total financial surveillance system, one in which every transaction we ever make is trackable.\n\nThat process is well underway in Sweden, as reported in the latest issue of Wired, which describes a country in which few urban bank branches have any cash at all on the premises. To go cashless, Swedes are using technology the banks put together called Swish—definitely not privacy friendly bitcoin.\n\n“Privacy is the right of billions of individuals not to be surveilled,” Mr. Antonopoulos says in the full talk, “and secrecy is the power of the very few to escape accountability.”', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

According to analysis from Cryptocoinnews, the increased demand from China could see the price of bitcoin break $500 soon.\n\nOn Chinese markets, the price spike has been even more striking, with one bitcoin selling for $499 at the time of publication on Chinese bitcoin exchange BTCC, which also reports a surge in the volume of bitcoin being traded for Chinese yuan Friday morning as investors seek to circumvent foreign exchange restrictions placed on the currency by the government.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has been relatively stable for the last three months, something for which the cryptocurrency is not known, staying between $420 and $450.\n\nThe bitcoin community is in a state of flux as two groups battle to decide the future development of the cryptocurrency. One group (known as Bitcoin Core) wants to retain the current block size and instead change the way signatures are stored on the blockchain while the other (known as Bitcoin Classic) proposes the adoption of an alternative blockchain. That blockchain, incompatible with the original, would increase the block size to 2 MB, a move some say would increase user adoption.\n\nLast month Australian businessman Craig Wright claimed he was bitcoin’s creator, who has been known previously only as Satoshi Nakamoto, and despite backing from several prominent members of the bitcoin community, doubts remain about his claim. As a result, Wright declared he was withdrawing from public life once again and would not provide no more proof.\n\nAnother factor set to impact the price of bitcoin is the impending halving of rewards for miners. Bitcoins are mined by solving increasingly complex mathematical equations. Currently the miners get 25 bitcoins per block, but that number will be cut in half sometime in July to 12.5 bitcoins per block — a method of increasing the difficultly of mining bitcoins over time.']"
05/28/2016,"['For the first time since 2014, the price of Bitcoin passed $500 USD early Saturday morning.\n\nLaura Shin of Forbes writes:\n\n“One of the most fascinating aspects of the Bitcoin narrative is the trajectory of its price. Since its birth seven years ago, this abstract currency that only exists as computer code and/or in a small but rabid collective conscious has gone from completely worthless to almost $450 for a single Bitcoin.”\n\nAt around 4:20 a.m. UTC on Saturday, May 28th, Bitcoin’s price exceeded $500 per coin. The price initially achieved that level in mid-November of 2013, and until now had not seen a similar price since late August of 2014. Bitcoin is at an almost two-year high.\n\nThe result of a depreciating yuan?\n\nThe price surge may be a result of many seeking to move capital out of China as the yuan weakens, continuing to fall against the dollar over the past month. Yuan markets made up for 94% of the exchange volume distribution over the last 30 days.\n\nChina has strict capital controls which restrict the flow of money out of the country, controls which have become more stringent recently. This has prompted citizens to look for ways around capital restrictions. These restrictions combined with a weakening yuan can help explain the recent rise in demand for Bitcoin.\n\nShin suggests:\n\n“History shows that influences on Bitcoin’s price will be as unpredictable as Grexit, Chinese capital controls, developer infighting, Ponzi schemes and whatever else fate has in store for this grand experiment with money.”\n\nBitcoin’s bubble, readjustment, and steady comeback\n\nOver the last three years Bitcoin’s price has been relatively volatile, especially from late 2013 to the beginning of 2015.\n\nDuring this period the price increased nearly tenfold over the course of two months, lost half that value over the next few weeks before rising back to near peak value, and then falling to the high $190s in January of 2015, a depth not seen since before the 2013 spike.\n\nDavid Gilbert of International Business Times writes:\n\n“The bitcoin community is in a state of flux as two groups battle to decide the future development of the cryptocurrency. One group (known as Bitcoin Core) wants to retain the current block size and instead change the way signatures are stored on the blockchain while the other (known as Bitcoin Classic) proposes the adoption of an alternative blockchain.”\n\nHowever, for the last year and a half, the price of Bitcoin has been steadily rising, more than doubling its value', 'Bitcoin price looks bullish on a higher timeframe chart like the weekly chart, but the BTC bulls must capitalize and take it higher.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price may trade higher vs the US Dollar, as it looks it broke a major resistance area.\n\nThere was a contracting triangle pattern formed on the weekly chart (data feed from Bitstamp) of BTC/USD, which was broken during the recent upside move.\n\nThe price is now above the 100-weekly simple moving average, which is a positive sign for the BTC bulls.\n\nBitcoin price looks bullish on a higher timeframe chart like the weekly chart, but the BTC bulls must capitalize and take it higher.\n\nBitcoin Price Crucial Break\n\nBitcoin price managed to slowly climb higher vs the US dollar, and traded above the $420 resistance area. The most important point was that the price moved above a contracting triangle pattern formed on the weekly chart (data feed from Bitstamp) of BTC/USD. If the BTC manages to gain strength, then there is a real chance of Bitcoin price rising in the near term.\n\nAnother crucial aspect is the fact that the price is above the 100-weekly simple moving average, calling for more upsides. Last but not the least, the price moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1150 high to $150 low. So, if the momentum picks up, then BTC/USD can easily move towards the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1150 high to $150 low.\n\nOn the downside, if the price moves down, then the broken triangle resistance area may act as a support area. Remember, this analysis is on the weekly chart, so consider it as a long term view and not a short term analysis.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\nWeekly MACD – The MACD is almost flat, pointing towards a consolidation before a move higher.\n\nWeekly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is above the 50 level, which is a positive sign for the bulls.\n\nMajor Support Level – $420\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $450\n\nCharts from Bitstamp; hosted by Trading View\n\nHeader Image: NewsBTC\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The Federal Financial Monitoring Service\'s (Rosfinmonitoring), released the plan to TV stations and newspapers across the country.\n\nDeputy Director of Rosfinmonitoring, Pavel Livadny, hopes that the new currency will be more convenient for Russians, and reduce the costs related to financial transactions. At the same time, there are plans to ban all other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin.\n\nRosfinmonitoring mentioned that they have already begun talks with major stakeholders in the future cryptocurrency; The Finance Ministry and the Central Bank. In stark contrast to Bitcoin, the plan for the Russian cryptocurrency explicitly says that it will have a central issuer in control over the currency\'s supply.\n\nThis news comes at a time of impressively steady growth in the trading volume between bitcoins and rubles on the unregulated LocalBitcoins platform.\n\nVolumes have nearly tripled this year, making record highs almost every week. Yesterday\'s volume of 27.8 million rubles (~$421,000 USD) is over five times what it was a year ago, and a hundred times higher than 2014.\n\nWhile LocalBitcoins is just one exchange available to Russians, it’s become the most popular amidst fears of bitcoin\'s legal status. The exchange has a strict policy of not reporting information to state and taxing authorities. It can also be used anonymously, since users can arrange face to face sales through the site using unverified accounts.\n\nThe Rosfinmonitoring plan includes licensing exchanges, using some kind of national identification in order ""to minimize anonymous transfers."" Russian citizens would then be able to exchange national currencies for the new, electronic-only currency.\n\nDaily cycles on LocalBitcoins have become a regular occurrence, suggesting that ruble traders are consistently converting bitcoins as part of their businesses each day.\n\nRussia will not be the first country to attempt to monopolize their electronic currency, but it will be the first to issue a cryptocurrency instead of an electronic version of their existing, national legal tender. Typical e-currencies are different from cryptocurrencies in that the latter creates currency units that are cryptographically secured and proven to be unique.\n\nEcuador was the first country to create a national e-currency, and also banned cryptocurrencies and other digital currencies within their borders. Ecuador tethered the issuance of their currency to the US dollar for stability, providing protection from debasement.\n\nThe purpose of the Russian ban on other cryptocurrencies seems obvious to many, but is a point of some contention between president Putin and other Russian leaders.\n\nPutin made his thoughts on cryptocurrencies clear last July in a statement to the press. He said that Russia\'s central bank has taken a somewhat reasonable stance so far on cryptocurrency technology, focusing on exploring its applications. ""[Bitcoins] are backed by nothing. This money [is backed by nothing], that\'s the point, this is the major problem,” the Russian president said to the press.\n\nWhile he states the use of cryptocurrency as money may be problematic, he also claims that the technology holds promise. ""We do not reject anything, but there are serious, really fundamental issues related to its wider usage, at least, today.""\n\nA bill then made it to the Russian legislature, in January, seeking to put cryptocurrencies in the same category as “money surrogates,” which are already illegal. If it eventually passes, it will use fines as a deterrent for using and owning cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe bill has separate clauses to effectively make most uses of cryptocurrencies illegal and subject to stiff ""administrative penalties” ranging from 20,000 rubles to a maximum of 5 million. It also calls for confiscation of all items responsible for the violation, such as mining equipment and the coins themselves.\n\nIt is not known at this time if this is the bill that will be used to make all other cryptocurrencies illegal should the new national cryptocurrency be issued.', 'Ransomware is a constant threat looking over our shoulders, and it sounds like internet criminals have once again upped the ante. Now that this business has become so very lucrative, cyber crooks have taken it upon themselves to provide a support page to affected victims.\n\nThe way these support pages works is to guide affected users through the payment protocol. The majority of ransomware infections require victims to pay a fee in Bitcoin, and a lot of people have trouble with obtaining cryptocurrency. A service desk for victims has been created by the developers of CryptoWall and Cryptolocker to make this process a bit easier. Apparently, they have been doing so since early January of 2016.\n\nBitcoin Ransomware Developers Become Helpful\n\nThere are quite a few benefits for victims to have these support pages at their disposal. One user even mentioned negotiating a lower price to restore file access, after one-to-one communication with one of the criminals. But there are some benefits to the criminals as well, as they can increase the payment rate for their victims.\n\nWhile it is incredibly annoying to deal with ransomware, the last thing most people expected was to get help from the assailants themselves. However, given this lucrative business model, it only makes sense the distributors want to make as much money as possible. If that means guiding people through the process of paying the ransom, so be it. In fact, one developer has added call center support, where victims can call to and get aid in paying the fee.\n\nBut there is more, as mouth-to-mouth marketing as to how assailants helped their victims will have a mental effect as well. Even if somebody pays the ransom in Bitcoin, there is no guarantee the hackers will send them the decryption key. This way, they can ensure they have somewhat of a decent reputation in the ransomware world.\n\nIt is a very strange business model, to say the least, but it does not come as a complete surprise either. Internet criminals see the value in spreading ransomware, but if no one is paying, there is no point in pursuing this business. As odd as that may sound, spreading ransomware is a business model like any other, albeit it is a very wrong and illegal one.\n\nIn the end, users still need to take every possible precaution to ensure they will not become the victim of a ransomware attack. Keeping the OS and antivirus solutions up-to-date is only part of the solution. Never click on unknown links, and do not open email attachments from untrusted sources. Last but not least, always make a backup of the important files on your device.\n\nSource: Finextra\n\nHeader image courtesy of NewsBTC', 'There are dedicated plans on the table to boost cross-border ecommerce in the European region over the next few years. The European Commission has drafted some new rules which address some of the most common hurdles when dealing with online commerce in Europe. This news can also be beneficial for Bitcoin adoption in the long run.\n\nWhen dealing with ecommerce in the European region, there are still some significant hurdles that need be tackled. Geoblocking remains a critical issue, as well as parcel delivery in other countries being too expensive. Additionally, consumer trust can always be improved. The European Commission has come up with new rules which should address these issues all at once.\n\nThe Ecommerce Rules Are Changing\n\nGeoblocking is critical within the European Union, as there are some regions where items are far cheaper or more expensive than others. Especially in the ecommerce industry, these prices should be on the same level everywhere. However, that is much easier said than done, and for the time being, a lot of consumers do not have access to the best deals available.\n\nCross-border parcel delivery is another top priority for the European Commission. Consumers and enterprises should always have the most efficient and affordable solution at their disposal, yet this is not the case right now. High charges hinder the growth of ecommerce within the EU and beyond.\n\nThe final point is to increase consumer trust within the ecommerce sector. Enforcing better consumer rights on a local level is one possible way to tackle this. But at the same time, consumers have to be sure they are not sending funds to an entity who will run off with the money. Unfortunately, that is rather hard to enforce, and new payment solution may be needed in the future.\n\nWhile this new proposal by the European Commission wants to address these three issues, there is some backlash as well. Ecommerce Europe feels this initiative does not address the real problems in the online commerce industry. There is legal fragmentation and a lack of growth in the European ecommerce industry, and this proposal will not change that overnight.\n\nCross-border Payments Beyond SEPA?\n\nCutting down on item and delivery prices will be a daunting task as there is no incentive to do so. The price point is partially determined by the supply chain process, and the fees charged by traditional payment methods are not making life any easier.\n\nIt would be wise to explore alternative payment options as well, and Bitcoin can play a prominent role in this regard. With its transparent nature, there is an immediate trust factor. Transactions fees are paid by the sender, leaving more breathing room for the merchant. Plus, Bitcoin payments are globally accepted, which make them a perfect solution for ecommerce in Europe and beyond.\n\nThe role of Bitcoin in the ecommerce industry should not be underestimated, as there are many benefits to using this cryptocurrency. Adoption remains relatively small, but some of the biggest companies in the world accept Bitcoin already. If Europe wants to bring change to online commerce, cryptocurrency should not be ignored.\n\nSource: Ecommerce News\n\nHeader image courtesy of NewsBTC', 'Santander has begun using an app for international payments using Ripple Labs’ blockchain technology, according to Ripple on its Ripple Insights website.

Payments made in EUR can go to 21 countries while U.S. dollar payments can only go to the United States.\n\nRipple is providing the technology for the app.\n\nSantander Shows Leadership\n\n“Leading banks like Santander are taking advantage of our enterprise blockchain solutions to improve their cross-border payments, drastically reducing the time and cost of settlement and enabling new types of high volume, low-value global transactions,” noted Monica Long on Ripple’s website.\n\nThe need for finance has expanded from providing a physical pound to being seamlessly integrated into a connected lifestyle, said Sigga Sigurdardottir, Santander’s head of innovation.\n\nSantander Seeks Progress\n\nSantander is working to ensure its banking is fair, personal and simple, Sigurdardottir said, and it views blockchain technology as playing a transformative role in how it achieves its goals to better serve customers by adding value from creating more convenience and choice.\n\n“Ripple is redefining the way that value moves around the world, and today we’re already enabling real-time, affordable international settlement between banks who have adopted our solutions,” said Chris Larsen, Ripple CEO and co-founder.\n\nLarsen said Santander is the first bank in the world to transfer real funds externally, and that in doing so, they are creating a new service standard.\n\nSecurity and regulatory compliance is key to all of Santander’s activity, Ripple noted, and the app has already undergone the testing needed for a rollout.\n\nSantander Invests In Ripple\n\nSantander InnoVentures – Santander Group’s $100 million fintech venture capital fund –joined Ripple’s Series A funding round as an investor, bringing the round’s total to $32 million in October.\n\nRipple’s Series A funding round included a mix of investment firms and global strategic investors that support Ripple’s vision to enable an Internet of Value by supporting the secure, real-time, settlement of funds for financial institutions and their customers globally.\n\n“Santander InnoVentures is a natural fit in this round because of their demonstrated support for real-time international payments and their commitment to new technologies that enable Santander to empower its customers,” Larsen said at the time. “We are excited to work closely with them in building the Internet of Value and accelerating adoption amongst financial institutions, market makers and businesses worldwide.”\n\nAlso read: Ripple Labs CEO: Partnership with banking block chain consortium R3 in the offing\n\nBelinky Praises Ripple\n\nMariano Belinky, managing partner of Santander InnoVentures, said the bank has long advocated modernizing banking infrastructure. In its Fintech 2.0 report, Santander highlighted a $20 billion opportunity for the financial services industry where distributed ledger technology will have a positive impact.\n\nBelinky said Ripple has the technology, talent, and momentum to address many such scenarios, and is exploring how best to apply Ripple technology in the bank. “Ripple and Santander share a common vision of the future of the industry, and we intend to jointly advocate it in the community,” Belinky said.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock and LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Das in Schweden ansässige Bitcoin-Mining Unternehmen KnCMiner, welches bereits 32 Millionen US-Dollar an Wagniskapital von den Investoren Accel und Creandum eingesammelt hatte, hat nun die Zahlungsunfähigkeit erklärt.\n\nEinst gehörte das Mining-Unternehmen zu den am schnellsten wachsenden der Branche. Nun markiert die Konkursanmeldung und die Zwangsverwaltung die wahrscheinlich letzte Phase für KnC, das 2013 mit verbraucherfreundlichen Mining-Produkten das Ökosystem von Bitcoin und anderen digitalen Währungen für sich einnahm.\n\nErst Anfang des Monats hat ein schwedisches Gericht noch im Sinne von KnCMiner entschieden, ein klares Gerichtsurteil zu Gunsten des Hardwareproduktes Titan von KnCMiner zu fällen. Das Hardwareprodukt Titan war zum Minen von Altcoins angeboten worden und verursachte bei den Verbrauchern einige Probleme, was zu Gerichtsstreitigkeiten führte.\n\nDer CEO Sam Cole hingegen bestreitet jedoch jeden Zusammenhang zwischen der Konkursanmeldung und den kürzlichen Rechtsstreitigkeiten mit den Mining-Hardware Kunden.\n\nCole betonte, dass der primäre Grund im baldigen Absenken der Bitcoin-Erträge, Mitte Juli, liegt.\n\nZurzeit werden bei erfolgreichem Mining eines Blocks 25 Bitcoins ausgeschüttet. Nachdem, Mitte Juli, die Halbierung der Blöcke eintritt werden auch die Bitcoin-Erträge halbiert, sodass der Bitcoin-Miner nur noch 12,5 Bitcoins pro Block erhält.\n\nSo äußerte Cole:\n\n“Unabhängig davon, wie viele Coins wir produzieren, werden die Kosten über dem Marktpreis liegen. Der Preis liegt nun ungefähr bei 480 US-Dollar. Mit all den Aufwendungen und Verbindlichkeiten werden unsere Kosten pro Coin über 480 US-Dollar liegen, was definitiv zu hoch ist.”\n\nLaut Cole war die Entscheidung für den Konkurs eine vorsorgliche Entscheidung der verantwortlichen Vorstände von KnC, um ein dahinschwinden der Einlagen rechtzeitig zu verhindern.\n\nEntsprechend der Entscheidung sagte KnC, dass es nun versuchen werde die profitablen Teile des Unternehmens zu verkaufen, ohne jedoch näher zu erläutern, um welche Bereiche es sich handele.\n\nDie KnC-Gruppe beherbergt, neben KnCMiner, auch Unternehmen aus der Software-Entwicklung und des digitalen Währungshandels, welche unter der Kontrolle vom Konkursverwalter Nils Aberg stehen.\n\nDies schließt allerdings nicht XBT Provider ein, eine Firma, die zum Teil KnC gehört, und Finanzinstrumente auf Basis von Bitcoin anbietet.\n\nIn einem Statement sagte Nils Aberg:\n\n“Unsere oberste Priorität liegt in dem Sicherstellen des Geschäftsbetriebes und der Weiterbeschäftigung der Angestellten, bis mindestens 10. Juli.”\n\nKommentar von Sven Wagenknecht, BTC-Echo:\n\nDas Block-Halving am 10. Juli wird viele Miner bzw. Mining-Unternehmen vor eine neue Herausforderung stellen. Dadurch, dass sich die Erträge pro Block halbieren sind die Mining-Betreiber auf einen steigenden Bitcoin-Kurs angewiesen, um den Ertragseinbruch, von 25 Bitcoins pro Block auf 12,5 pro Block, zu kompensieren. Auch wenn vielleicht nicht jedes Bitcoin-Mining Unternehmen das Block-Halving überstehen wird, so sieht es doch ganz gut aus, da der Bitcoin-Kurs in den letzten Tagen wieder stark angezogen hat (Artikel zur aktuellen Kursentwicklung).\n\nBTC-Echo\n\nEnglische Originalversion von Stan Higgins via CoinDesk\n\nÜber Sven Wagenknecht Sven Wagenknecht ist Chefredakteur von BTC-ECHO und verantwortet neben der redaktionellen Planung auch den Bereich Business Development.

LILKA je na elektronickou evidenci tržeb pln? p?ipravena a již nyní si ji m?žete vyzkoušet v testovacím režimu.\n\nPlatby bitcoinem jsou umožn?ny díky integraci platební brány Bitcoinpay API do LILKY.

Otázkou je, zda to lze v?bec srovnávat, protože bitcoinová sm?nárna nebo platební procesor p?i správném nastavení také dokáží za vte?inu zpracovat i n?kolik tisíc operací.\n\nPokud ale budeme brát p?enos platby bitcoinem jako vým?nu pen?z mezi dv?ma entitami a srovnáme tento proces s bankami, kde i tuzemský p?evod trvá b?žn? jeden den, je bitcoin už nyní tím nejrychlejším clearingovým nástrojem na sv?t?, kdy transakce zabere s první konfirmací zhruba deset minut.\n\nJaroslav Pr?cha\n\nŠéfredaktor', 'BIP0151 – szyfrowanie komunikacji mi?dzy w?z?ami\n\nW chwili obecnej komunikacja pomi?dzy w?z?ami odbywa si? w sposób jawny.

In der Nacht von Samstag auf Sonntag schießt er erneut in die Höhe.\n\nBitcoin Kurs über 450 Euro\n\nGegen 22 Uhr am Samstagabend begann der Bitcoin Kurs anzusteigen, nachdem er sich seit 10 Uhr am Morgen relativ gleichmäßig an der magischen 500$ Marke gehalten hatte. Der Anstieg des Vortags war lief bis in die Morgenstunden des Samstags und zog eine Stabilisierung nach sich.\n\nKursanstieg in den Abendstunden\n\nErst gegen 22:20 am Samstag wurde die 500$ Marke überschritten und markierte damit den Durchbruch nach oben. Nur eine Stunde später (ca. 23:20) erreichte der Bitcoin ein Level von 515$ im Coindesk BPI. Eine gute weitere Stunde verging bis Mitternacht und dem nächsten großen Anstieg. Bis 00:35 Uhr stieg er auf sein bisheriges Höchstniveau von 530US-Dollar und erreichte auf deutschsprachigen Marktplätzen wie Anycoin Direct Handelspreise von ca. 450 Euro (zum Vergleich: In den vergangenen Wochen hatte der Bitcoin sich ziemlich stabil an der 400€ Marke festgehalten).\n\nQuelle: coindesk.com\n\nUm knapp 12,5% hat der Bitcoin somit innerhalb kürzester Zeit zugelegt.\n\nUrsachen für den Kursanstieg\n\nWie BTC-Echo bereits am Samstag vermutet hatte, gab es ein Umschwenken unter Tradern, dass eine größere Welle an Bitcoin Käufen ausgelöst haben könnte.\n\nHinzu kommt die Geldpolitik in China: Eine Abwertung der Währung könnte Ursache für viele Käufe von Bitcoins gewesen sein. Wie marketwatch.com berichtet, wurde der sogenannte Yuan-Fix (Umtauschwert von Dollar in Yuan) auf 6.5693 gesetzt. Das ist der tiefste Wert seit über fünf Jahren, heißt es weiter.\n\nAus diesem Grund lassen sich auch Spekulationen anstellen, ob die politischen Einflüsse in China viele Bitcoin Nutzer dazu geführt haben, ihr Vermögen vor der Inflation zu schützen und alternative (digitale) Währungen wie den Bitcoin stärker zu nutzen.\n\nMeinung des Autors(Max):\n\nEine Kursanalyse ist gerade deshalb spannend, weil es zum Zeitpunkt des Geschehens keine “richtige” Antwort gibt: Letztendlich lässt sich nur auf finanzieller, politischer oder markttechnischer Ebene spekulieren, welche Aktionen für den rasanten Kursanstieg verantwortlich sind. So wird der wirkliche Grund auch in diesem Fall erst nach den Turbulnzen bekannt werden. Der Zusammenhang mit der Währungsabwertung in China ist dennoch ein realistisches Szenario. In Betracht könnte auch das anstehende Block Halving kommen, dessen Zeitpunkt auf den 10. Juli (ca. 40 Tage) geschätzt wird. Vielleicht haben wir es heute auch einfach mit einer Kombination vieler aufeinandertreffender Faktoren zu tun.\n\nBTC-Echo\n\nÜber Max Kops Maximilian Kops arbeitet als Analyst und Autor für BTC-ECHO und ist spezialisiert auf Fragen zur technischen Entwicklung von Blockchains als auch zu FinTech-Startups.

05/29/2016,"['Global professional services firm Ernst & Young has announced it will auction off 24,518 BTC (worth $12.9m) originally confiscated by a user of defunct online dark market Silk Road.\n\nThe sale will represent the end of a process that began in late 2014 when law enforcement officials in Australia confiscated the bitcoins from Richard Pollard, a Melbourne native who was later sentenced to 11 years in prison for commercial drug trafficking.\n\nErnst & Young said in a statement today that the auction will be held over a 48-hour period beginning at 12.01am AEST on 20th June 2016. As previous auctions held by the US Marshals Service (USMS) in the US, bitcoins for sale will be divided into blocks of 2,000 BTC (worth just over $1m), with a total of 11 blocks set for sale.\n\nIn statements, EY Transactions partner Adam Nikitins said he believes that the auction is likely to attract buyers from North America and Europe, as they were among the most active participants in the four previous auctions held in the US.\n\nNikitins said:\n\n""We are targeting sophisticated investors who can see the value of investing in a growing digital asset.""\n\nInterested parties are now able to submit applications to Ernst & Young for inclusion in the auction before a 7th June deadline, with the goal of all information necessary for the process being collected by 10th June.\n\nNotably, the event is likely to take place prior to the halving of rewards paid to transaction processors on the bitcoin network, scheduled to take place this July.\n\nThe timing of the event suggests that the economics of the bitcoin market continue to be a consideration during public sales events of confiscated digital currency.\n\nAuction image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'I have been a vocal enthusiast of cryptocurrency for years now, so much so that now I write about it every chance I get. However, when I write about cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, I occasionally get some flak in the comments. Some Bitcoin lovers can be bizarrely, sometimes hilariously, hostile towards altcoins. The comments range from calling whatever coin I’ve highlighted a “scam,” to being admonished for supposedly distracting from Bitcoin, to being angrily ordered to stop “shilling for altcoins.”\n\nMake no mistake, I love Bitcoin. As the glorious trailblazer of the new age of financial technology and the unquestioned champion of the crypto world, the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation will always be near and dear to my heart. However, I have still spared plenty of affection for other cryptocurrencies, as I believe that they are an increasingly important complement to Bitcoin’s frontrunner role. For several important reasons, I proudly accept the label of “altcoin shill.”\n\nCompetition is good for cryptocurrency\n\nThe main reason to support diversity in the cryptocurrency world is because of the positive effects of competition. In the world of fiat currency, the people are forced by law to use government-issued money, removing all incentive to make sure that money retains its value or is useful to its users (especially in countries with strict capital controls like China and Iceland). One of the chief benefits of using Bitcoin is the access to an alternative that it represents, a way out of the downward spiral of fiat devaluation. However, if Bitcoin stands alone in the brave new world of cryptocurrency, it too can become uncompetitive. If viable alternatives exist and are used, Bitcoin has to constantly improve or be replaced.\n\nAltcoins can do things Bitcoin can’t\n\nWhile flexible, Bitcoin was designed with a specific purpose and set of considerations. Other cyptocurrencies have the ability to build on that basic premise and improve on it, or deviate altogether. Auroracoin benefits from a pre-mined “airdrop” distribution combined with regional branding to expand cryptocurrency in Iceland in ways Bitcoin was unable to. Dash uses a masternode system to provide a more democratized system of development, and provides additional features such as integrated coin-mixing and zero-confirmation transactions. Ethereum transcends the barriers of cryptocurrency’s definition altogether. And Dogecoin does… well, let me know when you figure that out. All of these altcoins provide value beyond Bitcoin’s capabilities.\n\nWhat if Bitcoin fails?\n\nFinally, there exists a very real possibility of a world without Bitcoin. While the likelihood of the giant of the crypto world going away anytime soon is very slim, we cannot rule out a continuing unresolved block size limit issue (or any as yet unforeseen problem that might arise) rendering the currency uncompetitive enough as to be abandoned. Diversifying the pool of available and readily-used altcoins reduces the risk of cryptocurrency losing the battle once its fearless leader is slain.\n\nI love Bitcoin. But I love cryptocurrency more, and I believe its continued success hinges on the vibrancy and diversity of its ecosystem. The more amazing creations can come out of blockchain technology, the better. Because of that, I’m a proud altcoin shill, and you should be too.', 'Looking at the Ethereum price in the USD segment, very little has changed over the past few days.\n\nNow that the Bitcoin price has been on the rise again, the discussion ultimately turns to how Ethereum is doing. Albeit Ethereum has been losing some of its value compared to the Bitcoin trading price, the Ethereum price in USD remains virtually unaffected.\n\nTrading in the world of cryptocurrency is an exciting experience, as there are so many things taking place at once. Now that the Bitcoin price is rocketing over the past few days, there is usually a significant impact on the value of all alternative cryptocurrencies. Traders are keeping a very close eye on the Ethereum price as Bitcoin is going up in value, but so far, the impact seems to be minimal.\n\nEthereum Price is Not Dropping Per Se\n\nDepending on how one wants to look at the charts, the Ethereum price is either dropping like a stone or remains virtually unchanged. As the Bitcoin price keeps going up, it is only normal to see the ETH/BTC trading markets taking a hit. So far, this market segment has taken a nosedive over the past few days, which does not come as a complete surprise.\n\nHowever, a lot of people may have expected a far bigger price dip, which has not occurred just yet. Trading volume for Ethereum seems to be holding its own as well, with over 71,830 Bitcoin in trading volume over the past 24 hours. That being said, it is not unlikely the downward Ethereum price trend will continue while Bitcoin remains bullish.\n\nLooking at the Ethereum price in the USD segment very little has changed over the past few days. In fact, one might argue the Ethereum price has only seen a marginal dip over the past few days. This is a significant factor to keep in mind when talking about the Ethereum price, as the value in fiat is not following the same trend as the Bitcoin trading markets so far.\n\nWill This Trend Hold?\n\nThe Ethereum market cap is holding its own fairly well too, so far. Albeit the total market cap has dipped slightly below US$1bn once again, this is not a significant change compared to a few days ago. It is important to keep in mind the market cap for Ethereum is expressed in USD as well, so it makes sense to see the value not drop by much.\n\nThat is the central question for Ethereum traders right now. While it is good to see the currency being very resilient during this bullish Bitcoin price trend, it is impossible to tell if this trend will continue. What is worth noting is how this seems to confirm earlier claims of how Bitcoin and Ethereum are not competing with one another.\n\nSource: Coinmarketcap\n\nHeader image courtesy of NewsBTC', 'It was after Arthur Hayes got laid off from Citigroup Inc. in 2013 that he stumbled across one of the simplest ways to make money he’d ever seen.

Šimurina has just installed his first bitcoin ATM in Rijeka and the third one in Croatia. He partnered up with Dunja Despot, who has previously organized the bitcoin “meetups”, reports Poslovni.hr on May 29, 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, Kaji? has installed his second domestic bitcoin ATM in Split in early May, which is also the fifth one his startup Bspend had installed, including the ones in Greece, Vietnam and Thailand. The plans of both entrepreneurs are pretty ambitious. With the price of ATMs which cost about 100,000 kuna each, Kaji? has until now invested about half million kuna in the bitcoin business. Šimurina is planning to invest about one million kuna in it.\n\n“My goal is to install 10 ATMs in Croatia and in the region and this one in Rijeka is the first one in the series"", Šimurina said. He was encouraged to start his own business because of the fact that bitcoin is being actively used by 25,000 people. He was also surprised when he saw how well the ATM in Zagreb has been doing. The biggest individual bitcoin purchase amounted to 60.000 kuna, and the biggest bitcoin to kuna exchange was 19.000 kuna. In addition, three years ago Croatia became the first country in Southeast Europe where it was possible to use bitcoin to pay for goods and services.\n\nŠimurina also opened a consultancy related to bitcoins and registered a company – bitKONZ101. “People are buying bitcoins at ATMs because this is the easiest way to get bitcoins. This is why we have installed our ATM in a boat-hostel in Rijeka”, said Šimurina. Vedran Kaji?, who founded Bspend, said he was happy that the bitcoin community in Croatia was getting bigger. “I do not know what Šimurina has been doing, but I am happy that he is expanding the bitcoin community and I would not think of him as competition since he installed his ATM in Rijeka where I have none"", said his former business partner Kaji?.', 'For ABN Amro’s director of transaction banking, the company’s strategy on blockchain tech can be best described with a restaurant analogy.\n\nIf you were looking to enter the business, Karin Kersten argues, you might first invest in a restaurant. Next, you might try to get a feel for the workflow, washing dishes and observing existing staff. It\'s then, she said, that you might be ready to enter the kitchen.\n\nIt’s that final last stage that Kersten contends is most indicative of the activity at the Dutch bank, which boasts more than 22,000 employees across business lines including retail, private and corporate banking. A member of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project, and an investor in Digital Asset Holdings, ABN Amro has 30 employees actively working in the proverbial kitchen to investigate blockchain applications.\n\nKersten told CoinDesk:\n\n""We are doing experiments and seeing if they work. We are learning by doing, and working on different levels. There’s not just one team working on the blockchain.""\n\nThat’s not to say that ABN doesn’t have a more clear strategy for how it intends to move forward and which versions of the technology it deems more relevant for its business. As with many other major global banks, ABN is focused on distributed ledger aspects of the technology, and isn’t working with digital currencies such as bitcoin.\n\n""If you look at our view regarding the blockchain, we want to clearly separate bitcoin from the blockchain. There’s bitcoin as a method of payment, and blockchain as the technology behind it. The latter we find interesting to explore,"" she said.\n\nKersten indicated that ABN is investigating matters related to trade finance and transaction banking, and how blockchain smart contracts can be applied to problems in these areas.\n\nIn line with its focus on distributed ledgers, Kersten said that ABN is not as focused on payments applications of the tech, which she said the company views as being more problematic from a regulatory perspective today.\n\nLetters of credit\n\nThat’s not to say that ABN Amro isn’t looking to better develop an understanding of how the tech could be applied broadly.\n\nOne area of study for the bank, Kersten said, is how the technology could play a role in the issuance of letters of credit, in which a bank guarantees that a buyer’s payment will be received according to an agreed set of conditions.\n\nHowever, to start, Kersten explained how the ABN team approached this challenge by first talking with clients to understand the issues with current versions of this product. In the end, Kersten said this method found the bank deviating from its standard strategy, in which IT requirements dictate what is built.\n\n""Here the experiment is completely different. We had a hypothesis and tested it, then pivoted,"" she said.\n\nKersten said that ABN is now entering the second phase on this prototype and that it could advance this concept to the minimum viable product (MVP) stage, but that this process is taking time, a willingness to iterate and patience.\n\n""We want to learn about the content of the blockchain and see if there are interesting MVPs for clients. In the end, we want to add value,"" she continued.\n\nThe proof-of-concept is currently being built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nProduct over tech\n\nWhile Kersten said that ABN Amro is working with the technology, along with IT vendors such as IBM and Tata Consultancy Services, she said that the company wants to focus less on lower-level parts of the stack, such as blockchain consensus methods.\n\nRather, she would like to see ABN Amro work on other components of its tests, namely, the top- and mid-level applications that facilitate communication between an application and a blockchain.\n\n""You have to make a basis choice per application if you want open-source or closed-source technology, but we want to make valuable applications which are relevant for our customer base,"" she said.\n\nStill, Kersten acknowledged that ABN will likely need to deepen its understanding of parts of this process, such as when to select a public or private blockchain platform, and which design will best allow the necessary parties to access the ledger system.\n\nBut, Kersten said that projects like this don’t necessarily lead her to conclude that the technology will be ready for consumers soon.\n\nKersten told CoinDesk:\n\n""When will it be on the market? When will it have scale? We don’t know. What we know is that it’s a promising technology.""\n\nImage credit: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that ABN Amro was a member of the R3CEV-led banking blockchain consortium.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A bit over one year down the line, BitLicense is being constantly referred back to, in order to avoid doing the same mistakes.\n\nBitLicense, introduced by Benjamin Lawsky, then Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services led to the implementation of a stringent regulatory framework for the digital currency industry. The license was seen on par with the regulatory practices mainstream financial services are subjected to. However, the requirements stated by BitLicense, in order to overcome the decentralized and pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin far exceeded the AML and KYC practices otherwise followed by traditional banks and financial institutions. These factors proved to be detrimental to the majority of Bitcoin businesses operating in the State of New York.\n\nBitcoin was and still is relatively new, the sector being in its nascent stage makes most of the companies working on Bitcoin and Blockchain technologies startups. The stringent requirements stated by BitLicense was impossible to adhere to unless the company had venture capital backing. In addition, the BitLicense also threatened the very principle of Bitcoin, which was developed as a decentralized currency for peer to peer transactions where governments or any third party has no business meddling with.\n\nBoth factors led to the alienation of Bitcoin companies, most of whom decided to rather leave the State of New York instead of trying to deal with BitLicense which was virtually impossible for them to deal with, effectively creating a backlash against the newly introduced digital currency regulations. Few well-funded companies like Gemini, itBit and others decided to stay, the rate of innovation in digital currency technology came to a standstill in the state. Not to mention the services of some of the reputable platforms still missed by the residents of New York State.\n\nThe good that came out of BitLicense\n\nAs the use of digital currency and blockchain technology by various industries rise, many countries are feeling the need to introduce regulations. But they are also wary that these regulations may end up harming the ecosystem in their jurisdiction like it did in the State of New York. Instead, they have adopted a wait and watch approach. Recently, the same scenario played out in the European Parliament as well after its members decided to abstain from voting for new regulatory measures for blockchain system.\n\nDuring the session, the Members of European Parliament are said to have expressed these following views\n\n“As with any new tech, we are at an early stage. So what we advocate is not to stifle innovation by regulating too early,”\n\n— Jakob von Weizsacker, German MP.\n\n“I agree that this is both an important and exciting area and I welcome the very balanced approach to keep an eye on developments, embrace the opportunities but be alert to the dangers.”\n\n— Jonathan Hill, Financial Commissioner\n\nIn order to understand the progress of blockchain technology before taking any measures that can harm the digital currency revolution, the European Parliament has agreed to favor a blockchain task force that can monitor developments in blockchain technology in fintech sector over ad hoc regulations.\n\nThese developments show that the cryptocurrency industry has actually benefitted a lot from the BitLicense than expected.\n\nRef: IBS Intelligence | Ars Technica Disclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC', 'Darkode Forum User Gets One Year Imprisonment For Stealing Bitcoin & Selling Botnets\n\nToday, Rory Stephen Guidry, 29, of Opelousas, Louisiana, was sentenced to one year imprisonment for hacking-related crimes. He was arrested by the police on July 12, 2015 last summer, as part of the Darkode hacking forum operation.\n\nIn a plea deal signed on February 5, 2016, Guidry confessed that in 2014 he along with other hackers had taken part in an attack against a yet-unidentified online server, situated in Austin, Texas, 2016, according to the US Department of Justice.\n\nAt the beginning of 2015, Guidry moved from Liberty Hill, Texas, to his grandparents in Opelousas, Louisiana following a police investigation into this attack. However, that did not stop him in taking part in illegal undertakings.\n\nGuidry started allocating malware and using the infected hosts to construct his very own botnet, while he was in Opelousas. He then tried to sell the botnet, consisting around 5,000 infected computers at the time, on the underground Darkode hacking forum.\n\nGuidry also confessed to teaming up with another unidentified hacker to steal Bitcoin worth of $80,000, which they divided into half.\n\nWhen the FBI undid the Darkode forum and searched Guidry’s house, they also found 5,000 credit card records that were stolen.\n\nGuidry’s online handle was KMS, and he used the [email protected] Jabber ID. Security blogger Brian Krebs, who states that he conversed with the hacker many times via Jabber, stated last summer that “this person is perhaps the least culpable,” of all the twelve suspects arrested during the Darkode sting in the US.\n\nGuidry played a vital role in exposing many members of the Lizard Squad hacking crew, which directed the investigators later to the Darkode forum, says Krebs.\n\nHe also disclosed that Guidry, along with a friend, was trying to bring down Darkode itself, but before they could follow suit with their plans, the authorities stepped in.\n\nWhether it is true or not, Guidry did take part in the forum, which ultimately cost him his freedom.', 'Tierion has announced the launch of its latest API last week. The new high-performance API can be used to anchor data in the blockchain. Read more...\n\nThe Hartford, Connecticut-based blockchain company, Tierion has announced the launch of its latest API last week. The new high-performance API is made available for free to the developers, and it can be used to anchor data in the blockchain.\n\nAccording to a blog post on Tierion’s website, the new Hash API can be used to generate proofs and audit trails while maintaining the privacy of the data. Currently, the Hash API is free for creating about 1000 per hour at the rate of about 3 records per second. However, if a business needs to process more records then the company is ready to offer a custom version of Hash API capable of processing much higher volumes.\n\nThe Hash API can be readily used by developers. The only prerequisite for the implementation of Tierion’s API is to have a registered account on the platform. The API comes with a ready client library for Node.js which is openly available on the company’s GitHub repository. According to the company, they will be introducing client libraries in different programming languages, depending upon its demand.\n\nTierion’s application is built on the Bitcoin blockchain, to ensure the stability and security of the stored data. The record keeping and maintenance solution offered by the company includes Blockchain Receipts for each record as the proof of storage of data on the Bitcoin blockchain. These records can be easily retrieved and verified based on the Blockchain receipt. Usually the records and its audit trail, which includes information about any changes or addition made to the records etc. are bundled together, which allows access to both stored data and version control information.\n\nTierion Hash API and Confidentiality\n\nIn the case of confidential information stored in the records, it is not possible to share all the files with everyone or with a third party, either for regulatory, compliance or verification purposes. The Hash API allows implementation of Anchor modeling into the blockchain based data storage solution, where every new entry or changes made to a master file is stored as a Hashitem, associated with the master file and a respective Blockchain receipt will be created for it. This will, in turn, create a readily verifiable data trail which can be accessed without retrieving the master file. Such a process will come in handy while auditing a company’s finances, patient information and more.\n\nTierion’s solution can be integrated with over 500 different off the shelf applications, making it easier for companies to integrate the bitcoin blockchain based record management solution without having to make many changes to their existing setup.\n\nTierion, founded by Wayne Vaughan and Jason Bukowski has recently raised $1 million in seed funding from Blockchain Capital, Fenbushi Capital, and Digital Currency Group. The company has been relentlessly working on offering the best APIs and tools to the developers, making integration of proof of existence and immutable records into existing applications easier.\n\nTierion’s solutions can make adoption of blockchain based solutions easier and affordable to almost all businesses.\n\nRef: Tierion Blog Image: NewsBTC']"

Or at least, there are positive signs indicating that bitcoin might not be as dead as everybody thought. Bitcoins are now trading at $547.40 on Bitfinex (the largest USD/bitcoin exchange according to Bitcoinity). And it represents a big 21.4 percent price jump over just four days.\n\nToday’s price represents a 21-month high. Surprisingly, bitcoin prices had been relatively stable for the last two months before this weekend’s jump.\n\nWhat’s the reason behind this jump? It’s hard to say. Huobi and OKCoin, the two dominant Chinese exchanges, have seen many new sign-ups, as well as many buy orders.\n\nIncreasingly, bitcoin’s price variations are correlated with macroeconomic trends in China. These trends tell us that China still fears a deflation.\n\nAnd bitcoin is perceived as an alternative asset class for many people in China. Similarly, the Chinese government cloud cracked down on peer-to-peer lending, forcing lenders to invest in bitcoins.\n\nOther than China, there are reasons to be optimistic about bitcoin right now. In late 2015, many bitcoin companies started arguing in favor of a bitcoin fork to increase the transaction processing capacity. It led to a very ambitious roadmap for the original Bitcoin Core project.\n\nIn the coming months, many Bitcoin Core updates are going to make bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain more robust and more future proof. I’m particularly excited about lightning networks — these networks would make it possible to send bitcoins in seconds. It would turn bitcoin into a viable alternative to existing payment networks.\n\nFeatured Image: Antana/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE (IMAGE HAS BEEN MODIFIED)', 'Will we invest in and transact with Ether differently than we do with Bitcoin, since the two currencies have different monetary policies?\n\nEther has been dubbed Bitcoin’s challenger or its rival – Andreas Antonopoulos’ warning to stop calling ethereum ""the bitcoin rival"" is generating an intense debate on Twitter and Reddit.\n\nWhat individuals make of the growing debate over Ether and Bitcoin rages on with comparison being made from the point of view of how people invest in and transact with the two digital currencies.\n\nEthereum as a means of exchange\n\nAnalyst and Blockchain Products Lead at ARK Investment Management, Chris Burniske, predicts that Bitcoin will be used more as a store of value, while Ether, which is needed to power the smart contracts that are the main appeal of the Ethereum network, will be used more as a means of exchange.\n\nIn a Forbes piece, he states:\n\n“Both the Bitcoin and the Ethereum systems are built on a blockchain through which every transaction is recorded publicly allowing money and assets to be exchanged more quickly and more cheaply than using a long chain of middlemen.”\n\nPotential for trading\n\nIn December 2015, Ether was trading at less than $1. Now it has risen to $15 - almost by a 15-fold increase in six months. This, as well as Ethereum’s ability to create binding financial agreements that can be enforced entirely by software, has created a great deal of user interest in investing in the digital currency.\n\nIt didn’t then come as a surprise that about 11,000 anonymous people invested $150 million into the DAO - or the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. This Ether-nly crowdfund gives every investor the right to vote directly on any major allocation of the organization’s capital for proposed projects with a view to share in the profit accruing from such investments.\n\nDifferent consumers of Ether and Bitcoin\n\nHowever, unlike Bitcoin, which now boasts of 670 BTMs (teller machines) and payment acceptance in more than a hundred thousand outlets in various parts of the world, Ether-denominated electronic payments are still rare. It is mostly used to run programs on the Ethereum network, just like the DAO.\n\nThe Executive Director of Strength in Numbers Foundation, David Duccini, notes to CoinTelegraph:', 'In its quarterly, the IMF examines how Bitcoin and its blockchain technology may end up helping banks, despite being created to help avoid them.\n\nIn the June 2016 issue of the International Monetary Fund’s magazine, Finance & Development (F&D), it appeared in an article, The Internet of Trust written by Andreas Adriano and Hunter Monroe. The authors explained the trust journey with cash transactions to the impracticality involved in moving large amounts of hard cash around leading to the creation of paper-based, and later, electronic payment systems.\n\nEstablishing trust\n\nEstablishing trust without cash is complex and expensive. Banks require a complex infrastructure to ensure that transactions are fast, reliable and safe at a cost for merchants. Such transactions sometimes involve central banks \xadand can take several days. Even stock markets with virtually instantaneous electronic trades take two to three days to settle transactions and require additional players such as clearing houses. Financial institutions must set aside significant amounts of cash or other liquid assets until the transactions are settled.\xad\n\nMaking transactions simpler\n\nThere enters Bitcoin, the authors write:\n\n“Bitcoin—or more precisely, the underlying technology that allows it to function, called distributed ledgers, or blockchain—could allow what many see as a radical rewiring of the financial sector.”\n\nThey explained that the financial industry has tried to solve the problem of creating trust by acting as a trusted intermediary between individuals and companies who do not know each other - individuals and companies pay banks to conduct their transactions because other banks and the central bank recognize one another as trustworthy counterparts.\n\nBanks take $1,7 trillion in transaction costs\n\n“It’s great business for them: according to a McKinsey&Company report, banks extract an astonishing $1.7 trillion a year, 40 percent of their revenue, from global payment services. Even more surprising, despite all technological innovation, the cost of financial intermediation in the United States has not changed significantly since the beginning of the 20th century, according to research cited by the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andrew Haldane, in a recent speech. In a 2012 report, the European Central Bank (ECB) estimated that, aside from the fees everybody pays, the indirect costs are as high as 1 percent of GDP, which in the European Union alone translates to about €130 billion a year. And the cost of sending remittances to another country is even higher—nearly 8 percent according to the World Bank. However, a number of start-ups, many using Bitcoin, make sending payments as simple and inexpensive as sending an email.”\n\nReference is made to the start-up Circle Internet Financial which performs a remittance service free via Bitcoin.', 'A Darkode hacker has been sentenced to a year and a day in prison for illegal cybercriminal activities.

A press release by the US Department of Justice does not reveal if his bitcoins have been seized.\n\nDarkode was the most prominent English-speaking hacker platform that consisted of a forum and an illegal marketplace. To gain membership to the forum, prospective members had to go through several loops to prove that they were worthy of forum credentials. An individual had to be invited by an existing member of Darkode, before exhibiting a certain hacking prowess to prove that he or she had something to bring to the forum.\n\nA collaborative effort by law enforcement agencies globally saw 20 countries participate, leading to the takedown of Darkode in July 2015. 12 members were arrested at the time and up to 58 search warrants and potential charges were announced against Darkode members around the world.\n\nIn a statement, US attorney Stephanie A.

If we had had that the rest of this industry, so we had not gone bankrupt today. But we do not know if or when it will be changed.\n\nWhile filing bankruptcy is being touted as a loss-cutting measure, the company will still be involved in its other ventures, including XBT Provider, a company that KnC owns in part which offers Bitcoin notes on the Swedish NASDAQ, similar to the American Bitcoin Investment Trust. Nonetheless, a total of 34 employees will be looking for jobs, according to the Swedish news site.\n\nDespite many problems over the course of its history, KnC will be remembered as an innovative mining company, having only just last June released the 16 nanometer 3D FinFET Bitcoin mining chip, which enabled the company to maintain an edge on competitors around the world. This, too, was an effort to both reduce the company’s energy costs and to increase mining output. A press release from the time read:\n\nThe 3D design not only improves the speed of the processors, due to the shorter distances involved in shuffling around data down at this nanometer scale, but also dramatically increases energy efficiency. As the rate of Bitcoin inflation (production) is set in stone better efficiency means less energy consumed per minted (mined) bitcoin.\n\nThe primary reason for the closing is the upcoming reduction to just 12.5 bitcoins per block mined. Without a significant increase in Bitcoin price, and a high Swedish energy tax, the board of directors and the company’s investors are said to have made an executive decision to get out while it was still possible.\n\nCEO Sam Cole told Breakit.se:\n\nWe knew there were risks of doing it here in Sweden. We were aiming towards the clouds, not on building a mediocre midsize businesses. We took the big investors and chances spirit. But it has not paid off.\n\nThe company has reportedly been winding down operations and laying off workers for months in preparation for the halving, but finally decided on Friday to announce it would be closing mining operations by July 10th.\n\nThe Bitcoin economy frequently sees companies come and go, and KnCMiner is not the only big fish in the mining game to have dropped out of the race. Earlier this month, rival Spoondoolies-Tech also announced it was ending operations. The vacuum in hardware production companies may be filled with new ventures, or the market may instead return to the realm of hobbyists instead of professional investors and “cloud-mining” companies, which have often been plagued by scandals such as that brought on by American firm GAW Miners.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin is an economic network – it started from nothing seven years ago and continues to grow fast. Its economics are much more interesting than its technology. The technology isn’t new or revolutionary, but the application of the technology has created a new economic phenomenon, making Bitcoin fascinating to observe.\n\nThe Bitcoin network is multi-sided, with two categories of participants, the users and the enablers. The users are merchants, consumers, investors and speculators, and the enablers are miners, exchanges and developers.\n\nAs an economic network, Bitcoin exhibits network effects, both positive and negative. Network effects are observable in many other networks, such as telephones, fax machines, social media, PC operating systems and airlines. In this blog I explore these network effects in Bitcoin from an economic perspective. Many are positive, and extremely powerful, but there is also one negative network effect that is a big challenge.\n\nA Qualitative View\n\nThe numbers of merchants and consumers using Bitcoin may be small at the moment, but the more merchants there are accepting Bitcoin, the more consumers are likely to pay with Bitcoin; and the more consumers use Bitcoin, the more likely merchants are to accept it. This is called a cross-side network effect and it is a positive one.\n\nThere are also same-sided network effects, for example the more investors there are, the more likely the price of bitcoins to go up, and the more it goes up, the more investors are drawn in. The effect can be both positive and negative, as price drops can cause investors to leave. There is a similar same-sided network effect for speculators.\n\nThe enabler participants are dependent on the user participants for positive cross-side network effects. The more the Bitcoin network is used, the more incentives there are for exchanges to set up (to enable buying and selling bitcoins), for developers to build apps and platforms such as wallets or micropayment mechanisms, and for miners to compete for block rewards and transaction fees.\n\nThe miners are worthy of closer examination, as they underpin the whole Bitcoin network and make it work. Specifically, they compete with each other to create the blocks where bitcoin transactions are stored and they validate transactions through a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Validated transactions are immutable, they can’t be changed (unless the network is compromised, but this would require an unfeasibly large amount of computing power and electricity). This immutability makes Bitcoin what it is: transactions cannot be duplicated, there can be no double-spend of bitcoins, the network can be trusted, and because it can be trusted, it is used more and more.\n\nMiners make this happen because they get rewarded in bitcoins for their efforts, and bitcoins have value, so miners generate revenue. The more the network is used, the more valuable bitcoins become, so the more money miners make, the more they compete, and the more they compete, the stronger the immutability and trust of the network becomes.\n\nAs you can see, there are various sets of self-reinforcing dynamics in the Bitcoin network that interact and make it stronger and more valuable the more it used.\n\nIn the following section, I look at the mathematics of these dynamics and specifically at the economics of:\n\nUser numbers\n\nMiners\n\nTransaction scaling\n\nA Quantative View\n\nUser Numbers\n\nMetcalfe’s law for networks states that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected users in the network. In the Bitcoin network there are millions of wallets that people have downloaded to transact in bitcoin, but in this analysis, I have chosen to use the daily number of unique Bitcoin addresses. Currently there are about 400,000 unique addresses used each day, a figure that has approximately doubled over the past year.\n\nTaking the daily figures for the past year (June 2015 – May 2016), a scatter diagram of the Bitcoin market capitalisation (number of bitcoins x market price) versus the square of the unique addresses, does show a rough correlation between the two – applying a rather heroic least-squares fit to these points gives a formula:\n\nBitcoin network value ($bn) = 2.5 + 2.4 x 10-11 u squared where u= no. of daily unique addresses in use\n\nThis formula gives a network value of $6.3bn for 400,000 daily unique addresses on 30 May 2016, compared to the actual value of $8.1bn. The points on the scatter diagram lie from 41% below to 53% above the line produced by this formula, so it is only very approximate.\n\nPlease do not use this formula or rely on it to make any buying, selling or other decisions, it is empirical, based on only 12 months of daily data, unproven and will be different, perhaps very different, for the next 12 months of data to come. I only highlight it here to make three observations:\n\n1. Metcalfe’s law appears to be taking hold on the Bitcoin network - there is currently a positive correlation between the number of unique addresses used each day and the network value\n\n2. the value of the Bitcoin network may continue to rise significantly if the number of unique addresses increases – if the number of daily unique addresses doubles again to 800,000, this formula shows the network value may more than double to $18bn, but could be anywhere between $11bn - $28bn\n\n3. each additional unique address per day adds about $20,000 of value to the Bitcoin network – if the number of daily unique addresses does double, the value of each new address increases further to nearer $40,000. This illustrates the power of positive network effects when more people join and use the network.\n\nThe correlation between value and unique addresses will not hold during periods of excess speculation – as an example, the Bitcoin network value peaked at $13.9bn on 4 December 2013 when bitcoin speculation was at its highest. However, the number of unique addresses then was only 151,000. Even so, Metcalfe’s law is still becoming a useful way to understand network effects in Bitcoin and perhaps also to help identify when speculative excess is taking hold.\n\nMiners\n\nMiners get paid block rewards and transaction fees. A new block is created roughly every 10 minutes, and the miner winning the race to create a block gets 25 bitcoins at the moment. The reward halves every four years, with the next halving date being in July this year. After this date, miners will receive only 12.5 bitcoins per block.\n\nAdditionally, miners receive transaction fees – these are set by the sender of a transaction, and can range from 0, in which case miners may ignore the transaction (and never confirm it in a block) to 291 bitcoins in a recent case in April 2016 where it is assumed the sender made a spectacular error, perhaps transposing the fee with the principal. However, the transaction fee over the past 12 months has averaged 0.0002 bitcoins per transaction, or roughly 7 US cents.\n\nOver the past 12 months (June 15 – May 16), miners have generated an income of $486m, split 99% in block rewards and 1% in transaction fees. Obviously, as the block rewards halve every four years, miners over time need to become less reliant on block rewards and more reliant on transaction fees. This means it is in their interest for the network to grow in use – the more transactions, the more fees and the more valuable the network (which helps compensate for the fewer block rewards). This again shows the positive network effects and incentives in the Bitcoin network.\n\nOver time (perhaps 10+ years), the 99:1 split of block rewards to fees will reverse. Assuming that the $486m earned in revenue over the past 12 months broadly reflects the economic return required by miners to operate, at an average of 7 US cents per transaction miners should theoretically need to build capacity to support at least 7 bn transactions per year to be viable long term (at current growth rates, it will take 6 – 7 years to reach this level of transactions).\n\nThe proof-of-work consensus mechanism in Bitcoin gets criticised for consuming vast quantities of electricity to solve “pointless” algorithms, but instead you can view it as miners creating capacity for huge future growth. Even so, $486m per year to process 7bn transactions is still roughly 10 x the cost of running a comparable, conventional high volume domestic payments clearing system. I expect that the economics of mining will change significantly as the source of revenue shifts from block rewards to transaction fees, and will be very different in the future – in particular, if Bitcoin transactions do rise to the billions per year, I would expect transaction fees to be a lot lower than 7 US cents per transaction.\n\nThere is however a big “BUT” – miners may be building capacity in terms of hardware and data centres, but as I am sure you are aware, the Bitcoin protocol itself limits capacity. A block is created every ~10 minutes, each block is only 1mb in size limiting it to hold a finite number of transactions, therefore the number of transactions per second (TPS) on the Bitcoin network is finite, in fact only around 7 TPS.\n\nThis limit is already close to being reached – the miners may need the capacity to process 7bn transactions per year, or 220 TPS, but even if they have it, they are constrained by the 7 TPS of the current Bitcoin network. There is a massive gap between required and actual network capacity, and congestion is already occurring.\n\nCongestion is an example of a negative network effect and can significantly impact the economics and use of a network (anyone taking a taxi in central London nowadays during the day can get first-hand experience of this network effect – slow, frustrating, expensive, regrettable).\n\nSo what does this mean for Bitcoins’s network economics?\n\nTransaction Scaling\n\nIncreasing the fee for a bitcoin transaction is not really an answer. No matter how much you pay, transactions won’t get prioritised for confirmation if there are too many to handle. In fact, miners don’t necessarily prioritise transactions with high fees over those with lower fees. They want to maximise their fees per block, so their key metric is “fees per byte of transaction size” because, for various reasons, bitcoin transactions vary in size. Wallets are starting to calculate fees dynamically based on transaction size – this is probably improving confirmation and block efficiency, but it does not solve the congestion problem.\n\nCongestion is not the only negative network effect. There are others such as price volatility, hostility in some sections of the press and academia, rejection by the banking industry, legal and regulatory uncertainty, perceptions/misconceptions of criminality and so on, but congestion is the most critical at the moment. It is clear that unless the Bitcoin network is configured to scale, then the positive network effects will reverse and the network will unravel – if users cannot get transactions confirmed they will stop initiating them, the number of unique addresses used then diminishes, the network value decreases making it unprofitable for miners, who then stop mining. The network collapses.\n\nSolutions to the capacity issue already exist – block-size increases, segregated witness, Lightning networks to name a few. The challenge is for the enabler participants of the Bitcoin network to adopt these. For the Bitcoin network to continue growing, these solutions need to show network capacity can be scaled continuously, and can match the economic capacity miners need long term, say at least 20m transactions per day, or 7bn+ transactions per year.\n\nIn this blog, I have shown the power of Bitcoin’s positive network effects – but are they powerful enough to drive adoption of solutions to increase capacity and overcome the congestion challenge?\n\nMy guess is that we will find out over the next few months.\n\nAll data for the analysis in this blog is sourced from https://blockchain.info.', 'Should bitcoin be considered money? It is a question which banks, government, regulators and financial institutions around the world have been grappling with for years, but now the question could finally be answered in a ground-breaking court case, the result of which could have significant impact on the cryptocurrency market all over the world.\n\nMichell Espinoza, a 32-year-old computer programmer, was arrested for attempted money-laundering in 2014 when he sold $1,500 worth of bitcoin to undercover FBI agents who said they were going to use them to buy stolen credit cards. Now in a Florida courtroom, Espinoza and his lawyers are trying to get the charges dismissed on the grounds that bitcoin, under Florida law, should not be defined as actual money.\n\nThis is thought to be the first case of its kind and the ruling by Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler will be watched with great interest not only in the U.S., but around the world. “This is the most fascinating thing I’ve heard in this courtroom in a long time,” Pooler said on Friday. A ruling is not expected for several weeks yet.\n\nPhoto: LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Friday, economics professor Charles Evans gave evidence on behalf of the defense and told the court that in his opinion bitcoin is not money. “Basically, it’s poker chips that people are willing to buy from you,” Evans said, according to a report by the Miami Herald, comparing it to the value collectors assign to comic books or baseball cards.\n\nEvans is an associate professor of economics and finance at Barry University in Miami who has been involved with digital currencies for more than two decades, stretching back to eGold, which was used as a micropayment system in the mid 1990s.\n\nEvans, who says he is the first expert witness in a U.S. court case to have his fee paid in bitcoin, told the court that because no central bank or government backs bitcoin, regulation around the cryptocurrency remains messy; and the IRS believes bitcoin transactions are akin to barter.\n\nProsecutor Tom Haggerty argued that because there are numerous places where people can now use bitcoins to pay for products or services — such as shops, restaurants and even cosmetic surgery clinics — it should be considered the same as cash. “You don’t purchase a hamburger with a comic book,” Haggerty said. “You usually purchase it with cash, or in this case, a bitcoin.”\n\nBitcoin is the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of over $70 billion. It was created by an anonymous person or persons known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a decentralized and anonymous payment method which allows transactions to happen almost instantly and doesn’t require a third-party to verify those transactions — making it a much cheaper way of sending money around the world.\n\nThe reputation of bitcoin has, however, been tarnished with links to criminal activity with the anonymous nature of the currency making it appealing to those seeking to buy and sell drugs, guns and other illegal items. On Friday, as the court was hearing evidence, the cryptocurrency was experiencing a surge in its price, passing the $500 for the first time in almost two years.', ""There are a number of people associated with Bitcoin who have been caught on the wrong side of the law. CECG (Crypto Economics Consulting Group) has started a project to provide them with books when they are in prison.\n\nThe Crypto Economics Consulting Group is a group of crypto-economists and Bitcoin enthusiasts who are dedicated to developing and supporting the rise of a Bitcoin-based global economy. The CECG team includes Mike Gogulski (a stateless political activist and freelance translator) and Arto Bendiken (cofounder of Dydra).\n\nThe CECG Book Club\n\nThe book club is a long-term initiative of CECG to supply printed literature to prisoners who have been jailed for cryptocurrency-related crimes. CECG is open to suggestions regarding the literature to be provided to these prisoners. Of course, prison regulations have some restrictions on what can be provided (hardcover books, anti-government literature and books depicting escape from prison are all prohibited).\n\nSo, who are some of theses prisoners who have been incarcerated for Bitcoin-related crimes? Let us have a look at a few of them.\n\nJohn Powell – John Powell of Illinois was sentenced to 4 years in prison in December 2014 for operating an unlicensed money service business. According to prosecutors, Powell's business helped conduct illegal transactions anonymously, by exchanging cash for Bitcoins. Upon completion of the sentence, Powell will serve three years of supervised release.\n\nRobert Faiella – Robert Faiella, a licensed plumber, was found guilty in January 2015 of operating an unlicensed money transfer business. According to prosecutors, Faiella sold Bitcoins for cash to users of Silk Road, trading over $1Mn in a 2-year period. Robert Faiella was sentenced to 4 years in prison.\n\nCharlie Shrem – Charlie Shrem was the CEO of the Bitcoin exchange Bitinstant and was a co-accused of Robert Faiella. Shrem, the former Vice Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, was convicted of aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transfer business. He was accused of conspiring to sell Bitcoins to Silk Road users, while being aware that the Bitcoins would be used to buy illegal drugs. Shrem was sentenced to 2 years in prison.\n\nCECG has supplied various books including The Way of Men (by Jack Donovan), Convict Conditioning (by Paul Wade) and Solitary Fitness (by Charles Bronson) to those incarcerated. It believes that this is a long-term initiative and will continue to support these political prisoners."", 'Image: Flickr/Tax Credits.\n\nA trend is emerging in the Bitcoin ATM industry. Demand for the services among the underbanked and unbanked has seen steady growth in the two years since the industry\'s first Bitcoin ATMs—often referred to as Bitcoin Transaction Machines, or BTMs—were installed.\n\n""These customers may have a passport and valid ID but may not be interested in setting up a local bank account,"" Chris McAlary, CEO of Coin Cloud, a Bitcoin ATM operator in the western half of the continental U.S., said of underbanked customers.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) describes the unbanked as adults without an account with a bank or other financial institution. The FDIC estimates 10 million households in the U.S. are unbanked or underbanked. Estimates posit that approximately two billion people are unbanked globally.\n\nCoinatmRadar satellite views of Bitcoin ATM\'s worldwide.\n\nMost are American born, but immigrants make up a considerable percentage overall. Research suggests immigrants who have lived through a banking crisis in their home countries are less likely to open a U.S. bank account.\n\nCoin Cloud customers purchase on average $250 worth of bitcoins and sell on average $500 at the machines, according to McAlary. He observes that some individuals use smartphones for their finances—perhaps by downloading a Bitcoin wallet onto it—in place of a traditional bank account. To be sure, the machines don\'t work exactly like a traditional ATM. Instead, they are more akin to a vending machine for the digital world or a brick-and-mortar Bitcoin exchange that looks like an ATM.\n\nToday, there are approximately 600 working Bitcoin ATMs, though that number fluctuates as some machines go offline and new ones are deployed. In recent months, many well-financed operators have moved into the space to run networks of Bitcoin ATMs, sometimes on a worldwide basis. The industry has grown so large, operators in Europe employ armory cash pickup services, according to General Bytes\' CEO Karel Kyovsky. The Czech-based General Bytes, the third largest Bitcoin ATM distributor, distributed 95 machines mostly across Europe.\n\nBitcoin ATM distributors and operators, in the US and Europe, must operate within the purview of know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering laws (AML). KYC refers to how a business verifies the identity of its clients. AML refers to the procedures, laws or regulations to stop money laundering.\n\n""Nowadays, there is more of a balance between the customer\'s privacy and legal requirements.""\n\n\n\nOperators running networks of Bitcoin ATMs ""is pretty different from 2014 when Bitcoin ATMs were mostly operated by individuals or in small set ups,"" CoinatmRadar.com administrator, who goes simply by \'Vlad\', told Motherboard. CoinatmRadar.com is the central hub for all things Bitcoin ATMs, and Vlad is probably one of the foremost objective experts in the world on the space.\n\n""I think in 2016 this trend will continue to strengthen with more and more professional businesses entering the market, as well as business scale increase for existing operators,"" he said. The industry has stood the test of time, thus far, as Bitcoin ATMs look to be one of the easiest ways to purchase digital cash.\n\nBitcoin ATM industry sources agree that not much happened in the space over the past year in terms of bitcoin volume or developments. The number of Bitcoin ATMs still increased from 330 to approximately 550 bitcoin machines. This year, the global number of Bitcoin ATMs has reached approximately 640, though just how many of those function correctly is unknown. Vlad does much of the heavy lifting to synthesize what\'s known.\n\nThe chart demonstrates the growth in Bitcoin ATMs worldwide between Jan 2014 and the present. Source: CoinATMRadar\n\nFor the Bitcoin ATM market to continue growing, like other Bitcoin-related businesses, the Bitcoin price must stabilize. In their short tenure, Bitcoin ATM\'s have proven an instrumental piece of the Bitcoin ecosystem. When it comes to sending remittances (which Bitcoiners championed as a use for Bitcoin ATMs), and many other money transfer services, Bitcoin ATM\'s generally don\'t yet make sense compared to the competition due to their high fees. The average fee is currently 8 percent.\n\n""The recipient also needs to convert cryptocurrency to fiat which could mean another 6 percent on the other side,"" Vlad explains. This means it could cost as much as fourteen percent to transact at a Bitcoin ATM. Bitcoin price volatility, furthermore, could cost the sender and/or receiver even more.\n\nZach Harvey, co-founder of the second largest Bitcoin ATM distributor Lamassu, believes the more Bitcoin ATMs there are out there, and more people aware of them, the more useful they will become, and that fees will decrease.\n\nHe added: ""There are many more potential services that can be carried out on a BTM, once users expect to have them around.""\n\nYet, there remain hidden costs other than high fees and anti-money laundering procedures for the Bitcoin ATM industry. For instance, it can be difficult to find a bank that will work with a customer depositing a lot of cash—a byproduct of serving the underbanked. Thus, Bitcoin ATM operators must find a workaround, which could further increase costs.\n\n""Another factor is the costs associated with running such a business,"" Vlad said. ""Hardware costs, rent, liquidity frozen to facilitate operations, compliance policy development and conducting customer checks to follow legal requirements. All this adds to the final costs and is reflected in the fees.""\n\n\n\nMembers of the Simon Fraser Bitcoin Club unveiling a Bitcoin ATM at SFU Vancouver. Image: Flickr/Simon Fraser University.\n\n\n\nManufacturer Lamassu has seen Bitcoin ATM companies like Robocoin fall, and ones like Genesis grow to become the largest distributor of Bitcoin ATMs. Harvey told Motherboard that his company—like many in the space—foresaw 2015 as the ""year of remittances."" The company, founded in New Hampshire, developed a remittance system, but learned the remittances were not yet price-effective for people sending money across borders. This forced them to focus on their core business of cash-to-Bitcoin and Bitcoin-to-cash; in other words, serving the underbanked and unbanked.\n\nThe amount of privacy consumers enjoy varies from machine to machine as the industry, and regulators, grapple with the implications of the underbanked and unbanked using Bitcoin ATMs. Vlad believes the industry has come a long way since the days of the failed Las Vegas distributor, Robocoin, which introduced palm scans and other know your customer measures in an attempt at compliance.\n\nThese procedures could directly impact those who need the Bitcoin ATMs the most and don\'t mind paying the extra fees for a bit of privacy.\n\n\n\n""Nowadays, there is more of a balance between the customer\'s privacy and legal requirements,"" Vlad said.\n\nCurrently, there is usually some amount of bitcoins that can be purchased sans KYC verifications; then there is a limit after which a phone number has to be verified (SMS); and then possibly a higher limit, usually several thousand dollars, where an ID scan is required.\n\n""Of course,"" Vlad added, ""there are extreme cases on both sides, when Bitcoin ATMs require users to be fully verified from the very first dollar exchanged, or on the opposite end of the spectrum where there are no limits nor checks except for the liquidity of the machine\'s operator."" Vlad estimates the average transaction on Bitcoin ATM\'s worldwide is approximately $200, and the medium about $70-100. Other operators imply similar.\n\nThe intersection of the underbanked, and Bitcoin, means that the nature of the Bitcoin ATM industry will differ from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction. According to Vlad, Canada appears to be ""quite free."" But, the future of machines in the US, and particularly New York, land of the BitLicense, remains less clear.\n\nA BitLicense refers to a special business license for virtual currency implemented by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS). So far, Circle Internet Financial is the only Bitcoin-related business to have received a such license. Despite this, there are approximately sixty Bitcoin ATM\'s in the State of New York. A large share of these are operated by a national company, Coinsource, who declined to give comment about the Bitcoin volume at its machines.\n\nFor now, while manufacturers across the board are creating the tools needed to verify identities, most leave it up to the operators themselves—the ones stocking the machines with cash and dealing with customers—to implement procedures themselves based on money transmission laws in the relevant jurisdiction. These procedures could directly impact those who need the Bitcoin ATMs the most and don\'t mind paying the extra fees for a bit of privacy—the unbanked and underbanked.\n\n""The unbanked and underbanked are using our services,"" Moe Adham, co-founder of the fourth largest distributor, BitAccess, told Motherboard. ""Such activity is common for our machines worldwide.""']"

I believe that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot,” Dr. Wright said on his website.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters', 'Here we go again. After a long stretch in which the price of bitcoin held stable, the world’s most famous digital currency is on the move again—and this time it’s heading straight up.\n\nOn Tuesday, bitcoin was nosing towards $550 per unit, which is even higher than August 2014, when bitcoin prices reached almost $533. The recent move also ends a six-month period of relative tranquility in which prices mostly hovered between $350 and $450.\n\nIf you carve out artificial highs from the three month Willie-bot/Gox bubble, #Bitcoin now flirting with all-time mkt cap high (vs 6-2-14). — Ryan Selkis (@twobitidiot) May 30, 2016\n\nIt’s also a remarkable improvement from a year ago when the currency was in the gutter. On June 1, 2015, one could buy a bitcoin for $226. To get the flavor the recent uptick, here is a screenshot from Coindesk’s price index, showing prices in the last week:\n\nSo what’s behind the recent surge? It’s hard to say for certain since the workings of bitcoin are often inscrutable to outsiders, while those who are in the know typically have an agenda to push the price up or down. That said, here are three explanations for the current price jump.\n\nReason 1: Mining bitcoin is about to get more expensive\n\nRecall that bitcoin is “mined” by people with specialized computers that solve cryptographic puzzles. (This process also serves to provide a record of bitcoin transactions.) In return for solving the puzzle, the miners receive 25 bitcoins.\n\nThe nature of bitcoin is deflationary, however, meaning that fewer bitcoins are mined as time goes on. Critically, at some point in the near future, the reward for miners will drop from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins. (See this Bitcoin magazine article for more).\n\nIt’s unclear how this price cut, which will take place when bitcoin block 420,000 is mined (probably in the coming weeks), will affect the price of in the market. But several news reports claim the recent surge in the price may be driven in part by the impending stress on the mining supply.\n\nReason 2: Hype over a new digital currency is reigniting interest in bitcoin\n\nTech types have been buzzing about the emergence of Ethereum, a new blockchain technology that is winning big support from banks and venture capitalists. You can read a good explainer here, but the short version is that many think Ethereum is faster and more reliable than bitcoin, and could even supplant it as the pre-eminent digital currency.\n\nThe emergence of a rival currency might, of course, seem bad for bitcoin. A Quartz article asks, however, if a price surge for ethereum might instead serve to rub of on bitcoin. But so far, there is little evidence that the price of the two currencies is strongly correlated.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nReason 3: China, China, China\n\nThis seems the most convincing explanation for the bitcoin surge. According to the Wall Street Journal:\n\nHuobi and OKCoin, two Chinese exchanges, now collectively account for some 92% of global trading in bitcoin. The surge in bitcoin buying this weekend could be the latest sign of how Chinese investors are moving money between asset classes quickly in search of high returns.\n\nGoings-on in China have driven bitcoin volatility in the past, and it stands to reason that this is what’s going on again.\n\nMeanwhile, comments on Reddit and Twitter from those in the know not only point to a Chinese investor effect, but also raise the possibility that the effect won’t last. This will occur if the bitcoin buying just turns out to be a way-station on the way to other assets:\n\nThis. My concern is that big chunk of BTC buys is a short-term exit from CNY before dumping it for USD/GBP later. pic.twitter.com/OL3UmuUSoZ — Oleg Andreev (@oleganza) May 30, 2016\n\nSo is the current price surge a sign that virtual currency is catching on at last? Or is this just another example of bitcoin’s famous volatility in which greedy outsiders rush in to get rich, only to get burned when the price collapses again weeks or months later? We’ll see soon enough.', 'The head of the Dubai government’s Smart Dubai initiative provided new details on how she believes blockchain can help drive the city’s modernization efforts in a speech at industry conference Keynote 2016 yesterday.\n\nIn remarks, director general at the Smart Dubai Office, Dr Aisha Bin Bishr, spoke broadly about her organization’s plans to help make Dubai the best connected and ""happiest"" city in the world. Further, Bin Bishr discussed how blockchain fits into this larger strategy, while touching on her work with the Global Blockchain Council (GBC), the public-private tech initiative of which the Smart Dubai Office is a member.\n\nIn line with these goals, Bin Bishr sees blockchain as a technology that could power the Internet of Things (IoT) and ultimately help streamline the delivery of government services to smartphone devices.\n\nBin Bishr told the audience:\n\n""Blockchain technology is one of the most elegant and advanced technologies for cross-business efficiencies. We believe blockchain will have an important role in boosting productivity, increasing the competitiveness of Dubai and securing our economic infrastructure.""\n\nBin Bishr went on to characterize blockchain as a missing piece that could help her government, and those around the globe realize their visions for more connected cities by allowing the massive amounts of data that will be required to be better managed, while enabling benefits for end-users.\n\nThis March, for example, Smart Dubai announced the Smart Dubai Platform, a technology described as the ""digital backbone"" that would power the city. The effort is being built with local telecom giant du, and it is this union of IoT, cloud services and big data that Bin Bishr suggested she sees blockchain playing a role.\n\n""With blockchain, we believe that decentralizing the decision-making will add a lot of value, [allowing residents] to transact in a personal and seamless manner [and] creating a more efficient economy for all,"" she said.\n\nMore specifically, Bin Bishr said that her organization is investigating how blockchain tech can be used to create identity solutions that would reduce the ""pain"" that users now experience when transferring authenticating data.\n\nOverall, the conversation showcased how the Smart Dubai Office plans to leverage blockchain tech as part of a wide variety of new technologies for the benefit of the city.\n\nImage via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The judge’s decision—not expected for several weeks—could have a major impact on the future of the cryptocurrency.\n\nCharles Evans, an economics professor at Barry University in Miami, was called upon Friday to testify as an expert witness for the defense in the case of Michel Espinoza, who stands accused in Florida of laundering $1,500 in bitcoins and selling them to undercover FBI agents who claimed they would use the bitcoins to buy stolen credit card numbers. Espinoza’s legal team has sought to have the charges dismissed on the grounds that Bitcoin isn’t really money and thus the money-laundering charges against their client don’t really apply, reports the Miami Herald.\n\n“Basically, it’s poker chips that people are willing to buy from you,” Evans told the court, saying Bitcoin is less a currency than something collectors assign value to, like baseball cards and comic books. Evans’ expert witness fee—$3,000—was paid in Bitcoin.\n\nThe prosecution rejected that claims. “You don’t purchase a hamburger with a comic book,” prosecuting attorney Tom Taggerty said. “You usually purchase it with cash, or in this case, a bitcoin.”\n\nThe case is being closely watched around the world because it is believed to be the first money-laundering case involving Bitcoin, and the judge’s decision regarding Evans’ testimony could offer a glimpse into how the courts will deal with Bitcoin moving forward.\n\nUnlike other currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin is created by software—a technology called the Blockchain—and its value is not backed by a government or by a precious metal, such as gold. Because Bitcoin operates semi-anonymously, it functions somewhat like cash that can be transferred electronically and has been used in criminal activities, most famously to purchase narcotics and on the now-shuttered Silk Road. Bitcoin is also increasingly accepted as a form of payment by mainstream businesses. Regulators and law enforcement have struggled to grapple with not only how to deal with Bitcoin, but with more complicated questions like what, exactly Bitcoin is, which is why the judge’s decision in the Espinoza case is being watched so intently.\n\nMiami-Adde Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler isn’t expected to issue a decision for several weeks, but in court gave a nod to the questions at issue in the case.\n\n“This is the most fascinating thing I’ve heard in this courtroom in a long time,” she said.\n\n[]', ""Today, Bitmain, the Beijing-based Bitcoin mining giant, is releasing its new S9 ASIC miner. It is the first commercially available mining unit to use a cluster of 189 16nm ASICs and deliver a mining power of 14TH/s per single unit.\n\nThe S9 compares favorably to both Bitmain’s earlier models of miners and products of other companies. With an advertised hashrate of 14TH/s at a 1.38kW energy consumption, it offers an almost threefold increase in productivity at a similar rate of expenditure, when compared to the company’s last model, S7.\n\nIn its official announcement, Bitmain claims to have delivered “the most efficient 16nm Bitcoin miner” with low energy consumption and reasonable maintenance costs. The S9 is going to be available in limited quantities, so potential buyers should place their orders beforehand, on Bitmain’s website.\n\nThe ups and downs of Bitcoin mining\n\nThe Bitcoin network has experienced a sharp difficulty spike over the past two years, and mining became mostly an affair limited to professional enthusiasts and dedicated companies.\n\nSmall players were pushed out by vast mining farms operating at maximum efficiency in low-energy-cost and low-temperature areas of the globe.\n\nAny single mining rig available to an amateur was expected to last for about 3 months until it became obsolete.\n\nNow, that trend seems to have ended, with the difficulty expected to somewhat stabilize. Here is what Andreas Antonopoulos, one of the most prominent experts in the industry, had to say about this:\n\n“Over the next 2 years we will not see a 10,000 times improvement (in mining efficiency), we’ll see a 2 times improvement ... That means that instead of the equipment being obsolete in 3 months it will now have a shelf life of 2 years”\n\nNew era for Bitcoin miner manufacturers?\n\nThat potentially spells a beginning of a new era for Bitcoin miner manufacturers, who will compete with each other in a bid to offer an efficient and long-lasting machine. Bitmain stands to be one of the first companies to enter that race, with its announcement of its new gadget. The company claims to have won customers from more than 100 countries with its Antminer line of Bitcoin miners.\n\nBitmain also operates Antpool, the world's largest Bitcoin mining pool with 28 percent of the network's hashrate. And recently, it has invested $1.6 million in BitKan, a Bitcoin data and trading services provider.\n\nSharif Allayarov of Bitmain says:"", 'Tech giant Microsoft has partnered with startups Blockstack Labs and ConsenSys to build an open-source identity platform aimed at integrating the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.\n\nAn early version of the identity solution is expected to be available by the end of this summer.\n\nIn a blog post published today, Microsoft global business strategist Yorke Rhodes wrote that in the coming weeks Microsoft will launch an open source framework on Azure, where developers can build their own identity applications.\n\nRhodes told CoinDesk that this cross-chain applicability was of particular importance to those involved with the initiative.\n\nHe said in a statement:\n\n""Important to the open source blockchain identity initiative is that it is ubiquitous across chains and survivable over time.

Financial services firm Wedbush Securities, for example, has predicted bitcoin micropayments could be a $925bn market by 2025.\n\nOne of the earliest projects seeking to use the Ethereum platform for micropayments is Raiden Network, spearheaded by developer Heiko Hees, founder and CEO of Brainbot, a German-based smart contract and blockchain consulting company.\n\nHees believes the Ethereum network could prove to be the biggest enabler of micropayments, and that such transactions would cost less than they would on the bitcoin blockchain and be settled faster. A common annoyance for users of bitcoin, is that blocks on the network take 10 minutes to be processed, and to complicate matters, the standard practice by those who use the blockchain is to wait six confirmations until considering such transactions settled.\n\nEthereum, by contrast, has set its target on 12-second block times (though current block times are closer to 15 seconds), presenting perhaps the most notable possible solution.\n\nBut, Hees doesn\'t exactly see consumers interacting with micropayments. Rather, he is about machine-to-machine asset transfers, where machines, whether factory machines or drones, are the ones transferring value.\n\nHees called this ability a ""building block"" of the Internet of Things and offered the example whereby a machine could purchase resources, like the temperature in another room, based on predefined instructions. The vision is by no means unusual, even for an industry prone to big ideas.\n\nBitcoin\'s best-funded startup, 21 Inc, has been heavily focused on machine-to-machine payments, recently revealing Sensor21, a proof-of-concept for how machines could use its platform to buy and sell data related to the weather.\n\n""This can spawn a whole new economy if you allow these very tiny transfers,"" he said, adding:\n\n""Machines will do many, many transactions – probably more transactions than humans will ever do.""\n\nScaling up\n\nAnd then there’s the ""future of blockchain architecture"" consideration.\n\nThe Raiden network, when implemented, might help boost overall capacity of Ethereum. Hees said that Raiden network and will scale up the Ethereum network from 25 transactions per second to more than 1 million transactions per second. And Raiden Network aims to increase the availability other powerful Ethereum abilities, including some types of smart contracts.\n\nIf you talk to most decentralized currency enthusiasts, bringing the technology to more people is a huge priority. But blockchains can’t currently support the transactions of millions of people – bitcoin and Ethereum support seven and 25 per second respectively, while Visa can support 45,000 – and this limitation with public blockchain networks has become more widely understood with bitcoin’s divisive block size debate.\n\nEvery node on the bitcoin and Ethereum networks, which are today run by everyday users, keeps a record of all transactions made in order to verify new transactions. The more transactions, the more cumbersome it is to run a node.\n\nIn bitcoin, a proposal called the Lightning Network has become a popular suggested fix since the white paper was released in February 2015 by developers Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja.\n\nLightning-style, off-chain transactions could make decentralized money easier to use and bring the technology\'s capabilities closer to how users were told it was ""supposed to be"" – fast and nearly limitless in supply, while still maintaining decentralization, a feature that distinguishes bitcoin and Ethereum from other digital payment methods.\n\nAccording to this vision, most transactions will be made ""off-chain,"" lifting the burden from the underlying blockchain.\n\nThe reason that this works, in theory (since the technology is not yet live, some developers speculate that it could become too centralized in practice), is that either party can kick the transaction back to the blockchain anytime they want, thus giving both parties the ability to end the interaction.\n\nOf course, Ethereum and bitcoin are different beasts. Ethereum is branded as ""the world computer"", and is often associated with the ambitious goal of enabling the ""total decentralization"" of the Internet. It’s a flexible system that supports smart contracts and a range of experimental, decentralized applications, including an uncensorable Twitter and Augur, a project that wants to decentralize prediction markets.\n\nStill, even though the technology is different, scalability limitations still apply.\n\nEthereum plans to transition from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, which could help with scalability. But some developers question its level of security.\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin grappled with this problem in a series of blog posts and a white paper, suggesting a variety of methods, such as ""hypercubes"" to help the system support more people.\n\nEthereum\'s advantages\n\nThese scaling issues aside, Hees said that Raiden\'s implementation on Ethereum borrows many of the techniques from Lightning Network but that implementing them will be easier on Ethereum.\n\n""It’s rather complex to implement on bitcoin because you have to use the limited features that bitcoin provides in its crypto language. In Ethereum, regarding the deposits on the blockchain and settlement contracts, that’s pretty straightforward,"" he said.\n\nThis opinion is shared by other Ethereum-minded developers, including blogger Robert McCone who has argued that the Raiden network could live ""within"" Ethereum, rather than on top of the network, like in bitcoin, thus reducing complexity.\n\nRaiden network uses two-way micropayment channels so that users can update the transaction amount in both directions.\n\nThis would mean you don’t need to connect users directly to their buddy or a barista using a payment channel, because they can ""chain channels,"" or send the payment through a network of middlemen until it reaches the recipient.\n\nIntermediaries can’t steal the money because of a trick called Hashed TimeLock Contracts, as described in the Lightning Network paper.\n\nHees explained:\n\n“If you transfer from Alice to Bob to Charlie, what prevents Bob from running away with the money is Alice would hash lock the transfer to Bob with a secret and Bob could only claim that amount on the blockchain if Alice reveals the secret. But Alice will not reveal the secret until she learns that Charlie receives the transfer from Bob. Transfers are locked and cannot be settled on the blockchain until the secret is.”\n\nFor providing the service, each hop in the chain of channels will receive a small transaction fee before it reaches the recipient.\n\nAnd there might be other potential benefits of an off-chain network.\n\nHees, for example, highlighted that Raiden-type tech is a bright opportunity for privacy, a value long consistent with developers in the blockchain industry.\n\n""But if you have off-chain transactions then it’s not obvious that you’re sending to some other party. You’re sending directly to another party without involving a global ledger recalling all these transactions,"" he said.\n\nOnce Raiden network is set up, Hees thinks that a decentralized exchange of different assets, where users don’t need to hand over funds to an intermediary, will come naturally.\n\nHees plans to unveil a prototype of the network in the next three months.\n\nWishing well image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The central bank executive spoke about Bitcoin and blockchain technology and told the host Kenya is in no rush to adopt virtual currencies. Njoroge’s reasoning behind this statement is because he believes the country doesn’t quite have the technical means to handle cryptocurrencies at the moment.\n\nGovernor Patrick Njoroge says Kenya and its officials are not prepared to work with virtual currencies like Bitcoin at the moment. The CBK has yet to come up with regulatory policies and discussions of blockchain technology was a point of contention for the central bank. In 2015 the CBK issued a statement about Bitcoin and stressed caution to Kenyan citizens using the cryptocurrency. The public notice was issued after the recent argument and court proceeding between Safaricom and Bitpesa. The statement made by the CBK noted that the bank was the sole regulator of all currencies both foreign and domestic within the country. CBK said:\n\n“Domestic and international money transfer services in Kenya are regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya Act and other legislation. In this regard, no entity is currently licensed to offer money remittance services and products in Kenya using virtual currency such as Bitcoin,”\n\nThe central bank’s Governor again approved this message during the MindSpeak forum when questioned by an audience member about Bitcoin. The contention he and his colleagues have is that the cryptocurrency is not regulated by the central bank which can lead to illegal activities, terrorist funding, and money laundering. Alongside the typical issues central bankers have with Bitcoin, Njoroge says Kenya is just not ready to handle virtual currency on a technological level. Meaning the country’s system is not technically advanced enough yet to take on the virtual currency at the moment. The Kenyan economy is growing as Njoroge explains, “our economy is resilient even as the global economy is expected to grow at a slow rate of 3.2 per cent,” but needs more time to discuss regulatory policies concerning the cryptocurrency. However many Kenyans disagree with the Governor’s attitude such as columnist Michael Kimani, who writes:\n\n“The thing with Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, is they radically new and potentially highly disruptive. For us as a people and country, it offers a great opportunity to get in early and shape the development of this technology. We can draw lessons from Kenya’s history, when just 7 years ago, banks strongly opposed Mpesa, because it was novel, unlike anything that had come before it. Today, we see Mpesa everywhere, even at my local bank branch, a far cry from its early opponents. Kenya is now a poster child for mobile money, a global leader in mobile payments. Meanwhile, ‘advanced’ economies like the United States and Europe, are still struggling to shift to the much coveted mobile payments. — In the grand scheme of things, Njoroge’s comments count for nothing.”\n\nAs well as Kimani’s opinion the country shows strong support for the cryptocurrency. During April-May, the highest levels of Kenyan Local Bitcoin’s trading occurred during those three months according to Coin.Dance. BitPesa is also growing quite well and has received over $1 million in venture capital funding so far. Investors such as BitFury, the Digital Currency Group, Pantera Capital, Blockchain Capital and more believe in the sub-Saharan African payment processor. BitPesa has also partnered with projects like Keheala a startup which delivers disease management tools for patients. The collaboration benefits the company quite a bit because it often pays its employees in Bitcoin. Founder & CEO of Keheala Jon Rathauser explains:\n\n“Being in the early stages of operation in Kenya, Keheala’s payroll needs are dynamic. BitPesa has demonstrated flexibility by adjusting with the speed of changes on the ground. BitPesa beat the pricing of every other competitor.”\n\nWith initiatives such as Keheala and BitPesa partnering, Kenyans are not letting the opinions of central bankers bring them down. Technology is not going to pass them by if they can help it. Bitcoin-based mobile offerings such as BitPesa, and others have benefited Kenyan citizens a great deal so far. Ignoring this innovative growth most likely would add to the tumultuous markets within Kenya’s borders that took place last year and leave them even more so behind the times technologically.\n\nSource: TechWeez.com, BitPesa Blog, Mindspeak forum, Standard Digital News', 'One of the oldest, largest thefts in Bitcoin history, the robbery of early Darknet Market (DNM) Sheep Marketplace, may have finally reached its conclusion.\n\nFolks newer to Bitcoin may not remember the scandal, which led to the closure of the popular bazaar of mostly illegal drugs, which was later found to be run out of the Czech Republic, as thCCN reported in March of last year. At that time, the best theory was that the owner himself with the help of his significant other had robbed the site’s hot wallet himself. However, it now appears that Thomas Ji?ikovský may have been telling the truth the whole time and that security researcher Gwern Branwen’s findings may have been incomplete.\n\nWhile it is certain that Ji?ikovský purchased a home in the Czech Republic with proceeds from the market, and that the home was later seized by Czech authorities who also charged him with money laundering, it is now evident, given recent details made public by the US Federal Government, that, in fact, two men in Florida were actually responsible for the major theft which led to the market becoming insolvent. The men were just 21 at the time and their names are Nathan Gibson and Sean Mackert.\n\nSheep Marketplace was launched in response to the closing of the Silk Road, the largest and most high-profile Darknet Market in history, which led to numerous arrests including two federal officers who were found to be corrupt, having extorted and stolen funds from the market. Sheep Marketplace was rushed to production, and this could account for Gibson and Mackert’s lawyer claiming that the pair never had to hack the website. The original message given to Sheep Marketplace users similarly confirms this narrative, having said:\n\nWe are sorry to say, but we were robbed on November 21, 2013 by vendor EBOOK101. This vendor found bug [sic] in our system and stole 5400 BTC – your money, our provisions, all was stolen.\n\nFederal documents detail how government agents were able to use block chain information to track down where the bitcoins eventually wound up, and how, using information subpoenaed from Coinbase, they were able to find bank records, including how the pair’s funds were denied at various banks over time for being suspicious. It seems the criminal masterminds were not aware that large sums of money are currently suspicious in the regular financial world.\n\nIn all, the government has seized roughly $4.5 million in US dollars from the pair’s various bank accounts. The two have hired Jeffrey Lichtman, the famous New York attorney who helped get Mafia Don John Gotti off on extortion and racketeering charges in 1992. Evidence in those cases would have been sparse as compared to bank records and the block chain. The question of whether Thomas Ji?ikovský and his girlfriend were somehow complicit in the robbery remains to be answered, but CCN will be following the case with interest.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Equity prices\n\nThe S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) is expensive. The stock market price is currently about 119% of the GDP. Average annual total returns from that level is historically less than 1%. The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio is about 26, 58% higher than average. This is 92% as high as it has ever gotten. The 1929 peak with 97% and the 2007 peak was 95%. The tech bubble constitutes most of the period that was more expensive than the present. The implied future annual return is slightly negative. Globally, the price-to-sales ratio is as high as it has ever been.\n\nGlobally, the US market is one of the most expensive. Only two country markets have pricier CAPE ratios. The US market is also expensive relative to earnings, book value, sales, cash, and dividend yield. The only inexpensive country markets, such as Russia, have serious problems with both their economic and political systems.\n\nCash\n\nGiven the current opportunity set, how much of a portfolio should be allocated to cash? A lot. I don't know the right answer with any precision, but it is probably somewhere between 20-30%. In Preparing For A Market Collapse, I discuss the problems with value at risk/VaR and other Greek-based risk models and instead argue for sizing discipline and plenty of cash. As I argue in Contra Excess Cash, too much cash is a theoretical problem that almost never exists in practice. I don't say this out of pessimism about our current opportunities as much as optimism about the future opportunities that will require having more liquidity than our average counterparty.\n\nWhich cash?\n\nIt is easier to come up with obviously terrible answers than it is to come up with obviously terrific ones. Venezuela offers a currency that is so bad that its printers are starting to refuse to print it. They can't pull their payment off of the press fast enough to make it worthwhile. Its neighbors at the bottom of the Index of Economic Freedom - North Korea, Cuba, and Zimbabwe - are similarly flawed. But the top - mostly made up of a few ex-Brit city states in Asia, the Anglosphere, and some of the colder European countries - are not necessarily safe. As I suggested in January, it may make sense for American investors to diversify out of the US dollar,\n\nThe US dollar has been strong for the past few years versus most other currencies. If you are approaching retirement, it might make sense to at least partially diversify out of US dollars (especially if you intent to spend much of your retirement travelling abroad). One convenient way to do so is by shorting or writing calls on the PowerShares DB US Dollar Bull ETF (NYSEARCA:UUP).\n\nIt is down over 4% since then, but the idea remains sound. I also split cash accounts between US dollars and Canadian dollars. Depending upon where you live, it might be ideal to have bank accounts on both sides of the border.\n\nBitcoin\n\nOne allocation that helps further diversify your cash portfolio is bitcoin. I bid in the last government auction for 30,000 BTC and will probably bid on the next one for 24,518 BTC if I think I can get them for a good price. Ernst & Young is managing the process for the Australian government on June 20.\n\nHow much BTC should you buy?\n\n10% of your cash portfolio or 2-3% of your overall portfolio is probably about right. I would start with that and then allow it to grow over time with the increased acceptance of electronic currency.\n\nWhere do you buy Bitcoin?\n\nI would start by avoiding publicly traded trusts trading at a discount. For example, Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX:GBTC) is crazy:\n\nAs for me, my BTC wallet is at Coinbase. If you buy $100 of bitcoin or more on Coinbase, we'll each earn $10 of free bitcoin, so this is the ideal place to set up a wallet and buy a BTC or two. After that, I would also look here for subsequent BTC purchase; it allows you to buy BTC with credit cards (as a purchase, not a cash advance) which means that you can collect BTC while also getting credit card rewards. I have made as much as $250,000 per month of such purchases specifically for rewards. They also offer Ethereum.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is common practice to diversify between equity, credit, and cash. It is somewhat less common to thoughtfully diversify within cash. But 100% allocation to US dollars could be an extreme folly. Many sound alternatives exist including other sovereign currencies and bitcoin. I would consider putting 10% of your cash in bitcoin. Whatever happens to it in the days or weeks ahead, over the long term it is likely to gain wider acceptance and usage.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are short UUP.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
